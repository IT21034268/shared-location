2,Looses audio,"I loved my Motorola Bluetooth headset, but lost it. Amazon was out of stock on the new headset so I decided to give this speaker phone a try. I synced it to my iPhone - first gen. Unfortunately, the speaker phone has been a real disappointment. It was easy to sync and operate. The sound quality coming from my caller was good. But the item looses audio after about 1 to 2 minutes of operation. It remains powered on and remains synced to the cell phone, but both the speaker and the microphone cease to work. I am returning it. I ordered the Motorola H715 headset."
4,Bluetooth Speaker,All the features are good except for the fact that it can be charged by a Car Charger only. And it is not having a Caller ID.
4,Good Product,I enjoyed this product very much. It is a welcome alternative to a bluetooth headset. The sound quailty is great and the blue light isn't too distracting. The caller did have trouble hearing me sometimes though. But overall it is a great product.
4,Hands free product,This product is a perfect handsfree cell phone product-very simple to operate and does a great jof complete with volume vontrols
2,Don't waste your money,"I bought this unit about four months ago -- my first in-car bluetooth device. Since California mandates hands-free phoning, I needed one (I don't care for the earpiece units), although I don't use it often. Well, it worked OK the first few times I used it, although the sound quality was minimal. Lately it has stopped functioning as it should -- when you push the ""call"" button, it shuts the unit off! Motorola has been of no help whatsoever. My recommendation: spend a little more and get a better unit."
4,Motorola T305 Successful Bluetooth!,"Many Bluetooth devices are semi-satisfactory...working well for the person on the other end of the call about 70% of the time. Perfection is not achievable, given the nature of the technology, but the T305 breaks the 90% barrier and is a solid choice. Only a Jawbone earset at three times the price is likely to yield better results."
2,Didn't last very long,"I got one of these and it worked for a while. I, too, came to swear at that blinking blue light, it's really intolerable at night. But then I went on a trip and parked my car at the airport for a hot summer week, and the device never worked again. I'm now on the market for something else."
4,Useful,"I use this speaker in my car and find it helpful. The only negative is that it does not connect right away. It takes a couple of ""hello""s on my side while the other person is talking on theirs without me hearing. Good overall."
4,Great Bluetooth Device,"This device is convenient and works great with most phones! Plus, it is better than driving while holding your cell phone for sure. I would recommend it to anyone!"
1,Abysmal sound quality,"The sound quality was awful. I used it for a few days and verified that signal strength on my phone was not the issue. The sound had a lot of static and ""scratchiness"" both on my end (hearing) and the folks I was talking to."
3,Better with Motorola Phone,"This device works like is says it does, but with a Motorola phone..you can sync it automatically. Maybe other phones do as well, but I couldn't with my LG Ally. I had to do several things once in my car to get my phone to talk to the hands free device. Voice is clearer when you talk with your head straight forward. Turning head side to side muffled voice. Still safer when driving than the alternative."
5,Motorola T305 Bluetooth,The Motorola T305 was Easy to install and connect to. Great reception clarity and volume control.
3,Not as handy as I thought it would be.,I thought I would use it a lot more but I just feel rude talking to people on it and revert back to my ear bud or even the phone. It dose come in handy if you are on hold but other than that I never use it
2,Could have been great but found lacking..lacking..lacking..is that an echo I hear?,"I recently bought two of these, one for the wife and one for myself. First of all I had to wait almost 5 weeks to get them then when we finally got them, I was so disappointed. I didn't want an earpiece so we went for these. They synced up without issue, kept a good charge, etc. The problem was, I thought everything was great, I could hear everyone, no problem, voice dial worked great. Finally had a bunch of people say, I can't take it anymore, what's with the echo? I was like what echo? Until I called my wife and got the same thing from her, it was really annoying. About a 1/2 second clear as day echo of yourself speaking. I thought wow, that sucks. So back they both went. I just can't recommend this product. I tested both of them on our phones LG Shines and a few friends phones too, same results. Buyer beware."
3,A Little disappointed,Sometime the T305 disconnects on its own. A lot of time it will echo very bad on the phone of the person you are talking with. If you hang up and recall without the T305 the phones work fine. I have had this happen on several systems & several different brands of phones. It is great when it is working.
3,"Ok, as long as you hold it in front of your face!","I wondered why the product image page showed the sun visor half way down. It's because you have to keep it in this position for your caller to pick up your voice! You cannot have your air on or your windows down either. They won't be able to hear you and may even hang up thinking you're a prank caller, breathing into the phone. If you take the clip off of the visor and hold it in front of your mouth, reception is perfect. I had no trouble pairing it with my blackberry 8100, no problems charging it either."
2,"Sounds good for the person using it, not for the person on the other end","I got this for my wife for Christmas... I've been in the car with her when she's used it, and it sounds great if you're the one using it.... but then I've been on the other end as well... as the person she's talking TO while she's using it,.. and it's horrible. It picks up all kinds of ambient noise, which it seems to pick up better than the voice....definitely NOT impressive. I think I paid around forty bucks for it here on Amazon... which is about double what I should have paid."
3,Motorola T305 Bluetooth,"The sound is good but every 5 minutes it cuts out and I have to switch over to the phone very quickly or it hangs up, then switch back again. Very annoying."
5,Great Item Great Price,Bought this item for my husband who is a true skeptic of these types of items. It works great and he is extremely happy with it. He feels very comfortable calling and receiving calls in the car now with this Motorola T305Great product.
3,affordable bluetooth speaker functions well,"This external speaker pairs with my blackberry easily, and performs fairly well. I have to speak louder than normal for the call recipient to hear me. I notice some sound distortion on the higher volume settings, which I need in my vehicle in order for me to hear as well. However, for the price, this little unit works well, and works well enough that I will not be replacing it any time soon. I would grade this as a B-, but that isn't bad considering how much some of the others cost."
2,Compatibility problems with my LG phone,"I received this device as a gift. It works OK & has reasonably good sound when it's on & communicating with my LG VX5400 phone, but making the connection is a problem. I find that every time I use it, I have to remove it from my phone's list of Bluetooth devices & go through the whole process of pairing it with the phone all over again."
5,Something that really works!,"Motorola T305 Bluetooth car speaker.I can hear callers clearly and the people I am talking to say my voice is coming across to them clear. The blue flashing light can be anoying at night if it is in your line of sight but that can certainly be dealt with without to much work, it certainly isn't a deal breaker because of the quality of the unit.I really like this one beats the heck out of an earpiece type headphone wired or wireless!!"
4,My Review,"This is the best bluetooth I have ever used inside my truck!!!Because its a speakerphone makes all the difference. I tried going to ATT to get a bluetooth, i even spent all the money getting the best they had, the Jawbone and then the Motorola H12 Pure. Both of them worked great, except for in my truck, which is really the only place I NEED bluetooth. I had to find something that worked in my truck, because in California it is now the law, so this worked out great.The only bad thing I can think of is IF there are other people in my truck, then they would be able to hear both sides of the conversation. Now that is never the case in my line of work, but it might be something to consider."
2,Leaves something to be desired,"I purchased 3 of these, one for each of my family's cars when the hands free law came into effect in California. Even with the volume and sensitivity turned all the way up on this thing, the person you are speaking with has a very difficult time hearing you. I believe this is due to all the background noise from the car that it also picks up. I got so fed up with this product the other day that I went out and bought an earpiece bluetooth instead. It also constantly needs to be charged.I would recomment that if you are to spend money on a bluetooth device, to instead by an earpiece bluetooth headset."
2,Doesn't work well with Palm Treo 680,"I do a lot of freeway driving and I've tried 2 of these speaker phones with myTreo and the noise cancellation feature is poor. It works fine below 45 mph but the faster I go the more my callers complain about the road noise. Also you have to turn off Bluetooth on the phone when you turn off the speaker phone. The phone thinks it's still connected to the speaker phone,it will show that it's not connected to any Bluetooth devise but keeps the phone mic and speaker on mute until Bluetooth is turned off."
5,Small but super!,This is a great hands free bluetooth speaker. The speaker is very clear and conversations are easily understandable.
3,quirky,"somewhat good...the voice instructions get lost in translation to the computer...voice recognition not great...windows down are a killer on the rec'ver's side...windows up always ...need for better clarity..ie, user friendliness needs improvement"
1,Fake Device,"I was looking forward to get my new gadget in order to start using it on my brand new Car, but what a surprise, the device says on the back "" sample copy "" and when I tried to charge it, the USB plug in the device is fake you can't plug a charger on it. I pushed the charger tip on it but never fitted and the USB end on the device went inside it. I was frustrated to have received such a fake device, was it too much for 25 dlls??? why the seller doesn't specify this is just a toy, don't try to use it?dissapointed"
4,Convenient and easy to set up!,"Once you charge up the speaker (about 4 hours initially), all you do is clip it to your visor, sync your phone with the device, and you're ready to go. I like that it's easy to use and easy to transfer from car to car. I shut it off as I get out of my car, and have had no problems with charging. (I use my Razr plug-in charger with the device about once every two to three weeks and that seems to keep the device fully charged.) I have a 45-minute commute to work, so it's on at least 1.5 hours a day at the very least. I don't need bells and whistles, but this device makes it easy to answer and make calls as needed while behind the wheel. The sound is clear and the volume is easily adjustable."
2,Bluetooth Hands Free,"It came with only a charger to fit into the car recepticle and it takes two hours to charge it. I expected to be able to charge it at home using an electrical outlet. Also, the instructions appear to be for users with Motorolla phones although the production description said it worked with all Bluetooth phones."
2,Choppy sound,This is an all right devise but if it is too far away you can't here the person very well. I'm sure there are better devices out there.
3,"OK, depending on your use","I ended up returning this item in favor of an ear-piece. It worked fine and always paired with my phone perfectly, but I couldn't turn the volume up high enough for this to work for me. If I were making short calls just to get or give info, it might have been fine. But I use my time in the car (commute) to check in with mom, grandma, and such. This didn't work for long conversations mostly on the freeway. Also, callers couldn't hear me as well as they can on my new ear-piece. Wonderful idea, not so perfect execution."
4,hands free OK,"Motorola T305 Bluebooth receiver works as promoted. Sunvisor mounted, the sound is clear even in a convertible car. A value for the money.minor irritation: on/off button is small and same color as body of the receiver, making it hard to see!"
2,extra fail-safe buttons,"I hold my purchase until Motorola makeat least 3 extra buttonsfor 3 designated phone numberson the next model,So people with not so goodvoice dialling-phones can use itas a fail-safe option."
2,Pretty lousy,I don't understand all the positive reviews for this product. Let me list its deficiencies:* The light is too bright at night and too dim during the day.* The power button is almost impossible to press.* It rattles when I drive.* I have to shout for it to understand my voice commands.* The other person can't hear me when I turn my head.I was wondering what I was missing with my old Plantronics headset. But the T305 makes the headset seem pretty darned good. I guess that's something.
4,Not Bad For the Price,"If you need a hands-off device to conform to local laws, this little gadget fills the bill. It's easier to use than those annoying ear buds (at least in a car) and unless you are booming down the highway with the top down or sunroof open, you can communicate perfectly well. Note however, that it doesn't come with an AC charger, only a car charger, so you have to make sure it's juiced up. But given the occasional use, this is not a problem.Perfect solution for the occasional user. You'll be satisfied as long as you don't push it past its limitations--it's best to button the car up when you get a call."
3,Higher expectations,"The bad: The people I have asked, tell me that I sounds like I am talking from a tunnel, and that I am somewhat hard to understand.The good: It is great to drive and talk while not holding a cellphone to my ear."
4,Good for the price,"This is essentially a speaker phone. I bought this for my wife and she uses and enjoys not having anything attached to her ear or a wire dangling from her ear. She has called me on it, and I can hear her and understand her, but you can definitily tell that you are talking through a speaker phone type device."
5,THE BEST,Simple to unpackSimple to programSimple to usePush one button and it automatically connects to the phone.Every time.
3,Motorola T305 Hands Free Blue Tooth,"An excellent product. Clear, loud enough, connection easy and a very safe product to use. It has 1 fault it drops calls after a while and it seems always when you are saying something important on the phone which causes a re-dial."
5,superb product,"This is the third unit I bought, the 2 previous work really well and the battery life is really good, I use to turn off the unit when not in use, and can work more than one week without recharging (the cellular phone, when using bluetooth, requires a more frequent recharging time); the button to press and receive calls works fine either."
2,Bad Sound Quality,"People on the other end of my calls say I sound like I'm speaking through a tube. I think in a really quiet car with the visor a little lower than in my pickup it might work better... but not really impressed, especially when compared to the Motorola T215 that I replaced it with - which was only $45..."
5,Motorola T305 Bluetooth,I use this with my LG enV phone and love it. Very clear and no problems with connections. Very long battery life. This is a keeper.
1,It's a pretty expensive paper weight,"The audio is great and the voice dialing works. But people can bearly hear me, unless I take it off the visor and hold it close to my mouth. So in short, it's pretty useless unless somebody can tell me how to boost the microphone. I'll have to look at trying blue ant."
2,Worked good for a couple months,"I bought the Motorola T305 as a blue tooth for my wife's car. It worked well for the first couple months. However, after that all the calls had very bad static you could hear on both ends. It would not recommend."
2,Not very clear,Great size and convenience however the quality on being able to hear on both sides of a conversation is really poor. The concept is great but the execution is lacking.
1,"Bad quality, dropped most of my calls","The item does not work. I charged the item for two nights, then started to use it. For first few minutes, I can talk and hear, after about 5 minutes, I heard a big ""alarm noise"" and it continues (by this point, I can't hear and talk). So I closed the speaker and reused it after 2 days. It behavior the same, sometimes it works (the sound quality is very bad), sometimes it does not work (also it is dangours, I tried to hear the sound and it impact my driving). Also the power on/power off button is very small, you have to press the power button tightly and hold for a while, then you can turn on/turn off it, very inconvinence. I end with return the item."
3,Just okay,"I've had this for about a year. It syncs with my BlackBerry and my wife's LG perfectly. The device works well for in town driving where speeds don't exceed 45 mph. However, on the freeway, I have to hold it near my mouth or people on the other end can not hear me over the road noise. I drive a '98 Accord and an '02 Suburban and this goes for both cars. They're not exactly luxury cars, so road noise isn't great, but I'd really like to be able to leave the device on the sun visor without holding it (that's the whole point, right?). As far as the speaker volume, it's usually okay. Again, sometimes I have to hold it closer to me to hear what the caller is saying."
4,Well...,"This device is easy to use, and to set up, and works as advertised. The price is right, too, but I think a Motorola Bluetooth Car Speaker is incompatible with my LG cell phone, because all I get are complaints about the sound. I think I'm going to sell it and look for a different one."
2,"Great for me, but not for the other party on the line....","I purchased this speaker for my car because I have a slight hearing loss and my girlfriend had one that she used one day when I was present - the speaker was loud and clear.So I quickly ordered one -- well, guess what? It was true -- when I was using it the person I was speaking with came through loud and crystal clear. However, every single person I spoke to either complained of an echo, a rattling noise or ""a sound like marbles rolling around."" I think it was picking up vibration from my visor because when I took it off and held in it the palm of my hand they said it was markedly improved.But then ... that kind of defeats the purpose of the speaker in the first place, now doesn't it?"
1,Be prepared to be ripped off,"The product is great. It works very well, and I love it. The problem is the fact that it comes only with a car charger, and the instructions say to charge it for two hours before using it. That means that it's necessary to drive around for two hours with the device plugged in to the vehicle's lighter socket before the thing will work--unless you have another way to charge it. I had to contact customer service to find out that there is a wall charger available for $19.99--which is more than half what the unit itself cost. I suggest that you hold back from purchasing this device unless you have your own wall charger or can find one that will work, otherwise the cost to you will be whatever you pay plus an additional $19.99 plus the additional shipping cost."
2,It keeps turning off!,"The ease of use and sound quality deserve 4.5 - 5.0 stars, but neither of those issues matter when the speaker just turns itself off after about 2 minutes of talk time. At first I thought it needed to be charged, but that did not help. I have tried repositioning it and my phone, but those techniques were useless. It is really frustrating to get cut off mid sentence repeatedly AND I spend the first 30 seconds of each conversation explaining to the person on the other end that we will be cut off shortly. It really is too bad...I detest the earpieces and am going to have to switch over to one if I want to speak longer than a couple of minutes."
2,Too much noise to have a decent conversation on the road..,"May be I got a bad piece. THe first piece I got stopped working (microphone went dead) so I called up Motorola, and sent it back for service. They serviced and sent one (don't know if it a new one or old one repaired). Now, there is just too much of a disturbance in sound quality and very low voice for people on the other end that I get really frustrated using this. I threw this away and went to a series of other headsets and finally went to a wired Shure ic2-m headphones that works out much better.This is not a good product; looks like if it works for you, you are just lucky..."
1,Sounds like a tunnel,"I've paired this with Motorola Krazr, Razr, Blackberry and Treo. No matter which phone, everyone who I talk with through the T305 asks me if I'm in a tunnel. It does not filter any background noise, and sounds tinny to others. I do not recommend it at all."
5,Inexpensive handsfree,"If your looking for an inexpensive, good quality and easy to use portable hands free blue tooth device for your cell phone, this is it. Installation is simple, clip it to the sun visor, pair it with your cell phone and you're finished. Transferring it from one vehicle to another is without hassle. Excellent product."
2,Not too hot...,"Picked this up after all of the reviews, but everyone says I sound far away. Left it alone for a few months and tried it again, but it still sucks. Guess I'm going to an earpiece, which was what I wanted to avoid in the car."
4,Motorola B89170N,I love the concept of the product.. It is just what i'm looking for.it arrived quickly and the price was the best around.
4,Motorola T305 -,"I refuse to wear a Bluetooth handsfree device on my ear - not only are they uncomfortable but they look really odd. So, knowing that on July 1 you must use a handsfree device while driving, I went with this.The only problem I have with this unit is the microphone needs to be a little more sensitive. I clip this on my sun visor in my car (just like a garage door opener) and will even lower it towards my mouth when talking; the people on the other end still say it is difficult to hear me, and it sounds like I am in a ""tin can.""Aside from that, everything else is great: the speaker is plenty loud, the internal battery seems to last a very long time between charges, and through Amazon it was about $15 less than the same device at Costco. Not too bad considering the alternative."
3,Not as clear as I had hoped,"This is a handy little device to put on your visor. However, it still makes you sound like you're in a barrel to the other person. You really need to talk right into it to be clearly heard when driving. I might look into the higher priced car kits b4 buying again."
4,I like it but there is some background noise,"I really like this product because it is very easy to use. When it is turned off and a call comes in on my phone all I have to do is hit the power button (although the button is a little small - it would be helpful if the ""power"" button was the BIG blue button and not the tiny little button on the end so you don't have to search around for it) and it turns on quick enough to pick up the call. The only down side to this product is that for the caller there is a lot of background noise when I am driving at highter speeds - however, I believe this may be due to the kind of car I drive (a GMC Yukon with bigger tires) because my girlfriend has the same Bluetooth and it sounds fine when I speak to her (she drives a VW Jetta)."
3,"Solves many problems, but has some","Positive is that it is easy to use and has the mic and speaker built in - no FM transmission (which I did not want). I like hands free without the stupid ear piece thing.Negative is that it is not great quality sound - you hear fine, the other person does not all the time.I still use it though and would recommend. (~ 9 months using it)"
3,"Not bad, not fantastic","Paired up very easily with my Nokia, reconnects quickly each time, keeps a charge for a long time when actual talk time is infrequent. Biggest issue is when the car windows are open, even at fairly low speeds: I can hear the other person pretty clearly, but I am constantly told that I am coming through garbled and staticky. I finally started closing the window each time a call comes in - which is a bit of a juggling act, after turning down the radio, pushing the Receive button and then closing the window - or get the window closed and AC going before I make a call that I know will take more than 30 seconds."
4,Pretty satisfied,"The speaker works well in the car and is easy to use. It would be nice if you could plug it into a normal electric outlet. The only charger is based on the car's lighter. On the other hand, the standby time seems real good. No complaints. Doubles as an anywhere speakerphone."
4,Great Handsfree Unit,"PROS:Works great with my MOTO KRZR. Charged very quickly the first time and holds it's charge for weeks on end even with many hours of use. Very loud and clear. Almost never have any complaints from people on the other end.CONS:When things get noisy outside the car, for example, when I'm traveling fast on the freeway and it's a bit windy it's hard to hear poeple on the other end. Also, if I have a passenger in the car they can hear the conversation fine, but people on the other end have a hard time hearing them unless they speak very loud.OVERALL:Higly recommended. The best hands free I have used to date. You'll be hard pressed to find anything that works this well for the price, or, at any price for that matter."
4,Bright Blinking Blue Light makes this unit less than perfect,"Easy to use, holds a long charge, sounds great with very loud volume if needed. The people I call say it sounds good too - its perfect except for one nasty little thing. When the unit is in standby, which is 99% of the time, the blue light blinks very brightly every few seconds. I find this very annoying when driving at night. I think I might put tape over the light before I throw it out the window...."
2,This works fine for Bluetooth stuff,"I've not seen any high quality speakers out of bluetooth headsets, or speaker systems. This works OK, not great, not bad"
1,Works for only 5 minutes,"The speakerphone would lose it's bluetooth connection at exactly 5 minutes. My call on the phone would still be active, but I would be unable to hear anything on the speakerphone, nor could the person on the other end hear me. I would have to end the call and re-dial. And again be able to speak for only 5 minutes. I tried this with 2 different cell phones and had the same problem. So, I returned the product and asked for an exchange. The new speakerphone I received had the same problem (checked it with 3 different cell phones), so I decided to return that as well.Call quality was OK, but I did not see any point in using this speakerphone as I could only speak for a maximum of 5 minutes at a time."
3,Motorola T305 Bluetooth Portable Car Speaker,Hook up is simple. Sound quality is good. Call connection is weird. Sometimes the button works sometimes it doesn't. Overall it is fine. The advantage is you can put in on the visor and speak right into it.
2,Echo Echo Echo,"Works okay, however the main problem is that the folks on the other end complain about my voice echoing continually. Frustrating. Not recommended."
2,Bluetooth car speaker,"I bought this bluetooth speaker because of the good reviews, but I was very disappointed. I tried to place this speaker on my car visor and use it while I was driving, but it defeated the whole purpose. I had to hold the speaker in my hand to talk into it. The person on the other end could not hear me unless I hold the speaker and talk right into it. Also the listener complained because they hear all kinds of background noise like I was in the train or something. Only good thing about this speaker is that I could hear the caller really well but that's about it. I thought the price was pretty reasonable, but would I buy it again in the future? probably not."
2,Pretty much threw my money away here,"I gave this a generous 2 stars because of the ease of use. This was my first blootooth experience of any sort and I had no problems hooking it up whatsoever. Problems only came when I went to use it. Everyone told me there was an annoying echo when I spoke through it. Also, the speaker wasn't any clearer or louder than than that on my cellphone. I tossed it in my glove compartment after 2 days and haven't used it since."
3,Motorola T305 Review,"Very inexpensive and basically works well except the audio is a bit distorted. This is a good value for the money. Knowing what i know now, i would probably pay a bit more for one with better audio."
3,Microphone not very good,"It was easy to pair with my samsung gleam, after mashing buttons to get it in find mode. But my callers on the other end say they can barely hear me, and the quality of the sound is not good at all. If I hold it in my hand like a phone th quality gets better, but that defeats the purpose. I was looking for an inexpensive bluetooth speaker phone, and that was what I got. I had bluetooth through my stereo and it worked much better, but I recently purchased a car without it (won't make that mistake again). I got what I expected and I'm not overly impressed thus the 3 stars."
3,no 2-way conversations,"caller can't hear you when they are speaking which makes for a very irritating one-way conversation. otherwise, product works great. i have to turn it on EVERY time I get in the car."
1,"Ugh, horrible!!!","I don't have have expectations of any bluetooth device... because I haven't found one that works well.But this one is one of the worst!! The sound quality is awful and the person on the other end constantly complains about my voice going in and out.Lastly, this lame product doesn't even come with a wall charger... only a car charger yet the instructions say to charge it for 3 hours the first time. I ended up ordering the wall charger but it's a total waste because the quality of this bluetooth speaker is awful."
3,"Sounds good in the car, only fair on the other end","For the user, it sounds great. Speaker is loud and clear. I don't find the flashing light to be a problem as some other reviewers do. However, some people on the other end say its harder to hear me. I have tested it by being on the other end, and I have to agree. However, I have found this to be the problem with nearly every bluetooth device I have tried, whether its an earpiece or a speakerphone.All in all, I like the convenience of this item, the long battery life, sound quality in the car. As long as people on the other end are willing to work a little harder to hear you, its a great device."
3,OVERALL PRETTY GOOD - A FEW ISSUES.,"I was tired of using my earpiece Bluetooth so I opted to buy this after reading all the reviews and the rather inexpensive price range. I think it is a good purchase, its small, compact and does what you need it to do (make a phone call). The issues I have are just like the others listed, charging can only be done with a car plugin, the Power button is small and sometimes is a pain to turn on and often I have heard that I sound like I'm in a cave and they find it hard to hear me. (Of course this always depends on how fast I'm going and outside noise). Overall though it is convenient to just clip it to the visor and talk away without having to think too much. Just make sure you can get your mouth somewhat close to the microphone - I often tilt the visor down to bring the mic closer. I would recommend this product but if you are willing to spend a bit more than maybe go for a more advanced bluetooth."
3,Don't Buy if You Own a Convertible!,"OK product. Sometimes it is hard to hear certain callers, especially if they are on a iphone for some reason. The volume only goes as high as your cell phones volume level. I was not bothered by the flashing blue light like I thought I would be since I own a very small car. If you have a convertible-you can not hear while driving on the freeway!! Not that much better going fast on surface streets. No noise cancellation, remember! Though it charges quickly and is easy to sync."
4,Moto T305 Speakerphone,"I paired this speakerphone with a late model Moto Razr. It works fine. Sound quality is good with enough volume that I keep it on less than its maximum setting. All callers have said I sound good with no intelligibility issues. This unit charges with the same mini USB plug that my Razr uses. In essence, I now have an extra car charger. The on/off button is a little tough to see because it's small, but once you know where it is, you can turn the unit on or off by feel. It audibly indicates when it turns on or off. I can see the blue indicator light in the day without problem. At night it is a bit too bright, but you get used to it. After a few days, I didn't notice it any more. If it bothers you, a small piece of black tape with a small hole punched in it would work to subdue the light. My wife liked it enough that she now has one too. Much superior to an earbud."
3,Can't really chat on it,"I had a Motorola H700 before, and Jabra BT8010. I loved the Motorola, but I lost it, then I got the Jabra, it doesn't sit as nicely on my ear, always struggle to put it on and drop it easily. So I decided to get T305, to avoid the whole problem of trying to dangle something on my ear.Because of where it's mounted, on the visor, the mic on the device is actually quite far away from your mouth, so the other person on the phone can't really hear you very well. I'm a short person, which makes it even worst. With a little bit of practice, I can now use the voice dial with out problem. I can hear the other person very clearly, but they can't hear my very well. If the person on the phone knows you are using this device, and has the patient, this can work in a pinch. But don't expect to carry a normal conversation with it.I used to be able to talk with my Motorola T710, and the other person wouldn't even notice that I was using a hands free. Maybe I will get another one again."
4,Motorola Bluetooth Speaker,"I purchased the Motorola T305 Bluetooth Hands Free Speaker for use in my car. I am extremely happy with the product based upon the price I paid!I can clearly hear to whomever I am speaking to, although I have been told that I sporadically cut out on the other end.The speaker is small & clips onto my visor without taking up alot of space.Overall good product for the money paid!"
4,It's OK,"It's OK but I can't figure out a way to switch it from Bluetooth back to the phone during an actual call. With my ear bluetooth device I can toggle between my phone and my device. With this motorola device I am unable to send it back to my phone. If anyone knows of a way to toggle, would you please share your information. Overall, it does what it was suppose to do."
5,Motorola T305 Bluetooth hands Free,"An excellent product. Well designed, easily installed, clear voice and nice volume controls. Good value for the money. Highly recommended."
5,Great Unit,"I just received my unit from Amazon and it works great. The volume is very good and the sound quality on the other end is perfect even while driving at 45 mph, and my car has quite a bit of road noise from the touring suspension and Z rated tires. I use an iPhone with this unit so even when I am outside of the car and receive a call, my phone rings and I have the option to take the call on my phone. The blue light is a little distracting so I placed black tape over the light. To check if the unit is on during the day time I just press the call button and if it beeps the unit is still on. For the price it beats any over the ear unit. I just ordered another unit for my other car so don't have to move one between cars. As for a wall charger, it uses the same charger as my wife's Moto Raza V3 phone."
2,"Great idea, but volume control needs tweaking.","I purchased this to enable me to chat hands free while in the car. Unfortunately, the volume isn't loud enough for me to hear the other person if I'm going over 50 mph. My car is a Honda Accord and isn't that so loud that this should be a problem. Also, I am young with very good hearing. I've had to regress back to using the hands free wire/ear piece that came with the phone. Very disappointed.Motorola T305 Bluetooth Portable Car Speaker"
4,"Great for the car, but the other end hears an echo","This is exactly what I was looking for. It is small (fits in the palm of my hand) and it is loud, which is good because my phone speaker wasn't cutting it and I was looking for something that would work while I drive (I hear a lot of noise from outside, but this still works). The one thing I will say is that people I talk to say they hear an echo of themselves. Still trying to work this out, but I'm not complaining about it."
2,Everyone complains that they can't understand me,"I really like the convenience of a bluetooth visor unit. I was optimistic about the T305. The pairing was easy with my blackberry curve, I understand how to turn it off when I leave my car so it won't answer when I don't want it too. The sound quality on my end is fine but I have endless complaints by the folks on the other end that it sounds like I'm in a trash can, they can't understand me, there is too much background noise. I have gone back to using the speakerphone on my phone which is not optimal either. I am going to try the Blackberry VM 605, the reviews seem to be quite favorable but then the ones for the 305 were also. I need to have good enough sound quality to respectably run my business. All of the choices are very confusing and I will be very glad if I can find something that works and sounds more professional."
2,Not loud enough,"Nice product, simple to use. No problem linking to my Blackberry Curve. But the volume doesn't go high enough. Even on the highest setting, I find myself straining to hear. (my hearing is actually good) Might work better in a car with a quiet interior, but almost worthless in my RAV4."
2,Works OK if vehicle is quiet,I bought this about a year ago and it works OK but my truck is a bit noisy due to the diesel engine and road noise. People have a hard time hearing me and the voice recognition on the phone has a hard time recognizing my speach patterns through this device. Otherwise it works well.
1,Only if the car isn't moving,"This works pretty well except when the car is moving and their is a vibration in the casing that causes it to sound like someone wadding up paper right in your ear if you are listening to the person using it. I bought it for my daughter but when she calls, I can't make out what she is saying because of this vibration/crackling noise in the background. I'm still looking for something better."
1,Cant rate the item as the shipper never has it in stock.,"Twice now, I've attemped to order this item from eForcecity. Both times and currently they list it as ""IN STOCK"" both times within a day, I've recieved a so sorry, it's out of stock.If they don't have it in stock, why is it still listed as in stock."
4,Good CD,"I saw Inhabited in person and I thought that they were pretty good, so I decided to buy the cd. It's not my favorite cd I own, but I still like it. You don't have to be a Christian to enjoy good Christian rock."
3,Okay..but could have been better.,"The band has talent and the vocals are enjoyable but their simply isnt enought here to interest you. It's just radio friendly over produced rock n roll soft enough to be radio friendly and commercial but yet heavy enough to appeal to rock fans. In the end it's formulated and the lyrics are typical and cliche. Not saying their bad, i think they can do a lot better in the future."
3,Naruto lost a little respect,This has been a good series until volume 8. these ep. are dumb I hope they are fillers like that one guy said.I have all the other box sets as well and they were not like this. I will buy the next box so I hope they are better.
3,"Takes some more listens, probably...","Most of Mark's stuff is just great work, and though there is so much out there of his--including his work with American Music Club--one still often finds the ""oldies but goodies"" continuously recycled. For a long-time fan, they will probably enjoy just going back to those older songs, and not care too much for some of his more recent experiments. I probably fall into that category, though I do want to keep trying it out; surely there's some more gems to expect from Mr. Eitzel. This disc may provide those."
1,Not a good XLR for commercail,"i used three of these in a commercial installation-the pins that the XLR will be mating to (in this wall plate) are not held in by any method it appears-they generally will dislodge from the xlr being pushed out the back by the insertion of the XLR; repeated plugging will cause the connection to fail resulting in hum, feedback, or no connection. Don't buy unless you need just a one shot plug and will never unplug it. all of mine had hum for the most part."
5,WOW!!,So my friend has some of this stuff and we used it. its definitely a pleasant smelling odor remover. Totally going to buy some. Smells like a freshly peeled orange!
4,Back in Style,"After a working-over by the music industry and nearly going their seperate ways, the Badlees have returned, ""Renew""-ed. An excellent album that shows a harder edge, a softer edge and just about everything in between. Fans of their more acoustic sound won't have much to listen to hear as the band becomes more involved with overdubs and slicker production values. An excellent album for a band that defies stereotyping and does their own thing with their music. My biggest disappointment is the brevity of the album - 39 minutes. Highlights - all of it!"
5,All About Cindy,"Well Yes I believe the story and yes I think it's true though Cindy would have every one believe she was innocent. She still has a great deal of mental issues which is quite sad and her 5 children are in a very dangerous place with her until she recievs some help. I do believe they need to keep this book in print and do a follow up. I know Cindy, her 5 children and her 2 ex-husbands and every one she has been with she has done a number on through her psycotic episodes.She has moments where all appears good then out of the blue everyone is ganging up on her and she looses it.I spent a great deal of time with her and the things I witnessed lead me to believe every word of the book to be true."
5,knows Cindy,"I have read this book, for one purpose, and one purpose only. The person they refer to here as Cindy, wno's friend is Shirley is someone I know. I heard about this book through my mother who heard about this book from someone Cindy and we know. Cindy and her now ex husband both denies that she had any involvement with that book. But, the name that they give is Cindy's maiden name. And I wonder if it was really true or not, or if someone just wanted to make it look like it was a true story. If it is a true story, then, Cindy has really changed a lot, and she now has 5 kids. I just thought that I would go ahead and let you all know, so do any of you really think this is a true story?"
5,The story of Shirley and Cindy,"If you want to know how two young girls, ages 14 and 15, could ameteurishly slaughter an 85-year-old woman who had let them into her house to let them use the telephone, then read this book.While giving due space to the horrific crime committed by Shirley Wolf and Cindy Collier, the book also recounts the abuse Shirley and Cindy suffered at the hands of their families. Shirley's experience is almost unimagineable. Her father began molesting her at age three, and began having intercourse with her at age nine. He took nude photos of her to share with other pedophiles.But there's more. It seems that, in a twisted and perverse way, Shirley loved her father, and was her mother's rival for his affections. An unbelievable but true story, it will steamroll even the most ardent reader of true crime. Read it and be changed!"
5,Incredible story.,"I read this book about 6 years ago, but I have never been able to forget the unbelievable stories of Cindy and Shirley. Two amateur killers whose life's stories will really touch you and tug at your heart."
5,Helen Mirren: Prime Suspect: A Celebration,I received it promptly and in perfect condition. I'm very happy with the service!
3,Good album,"Scarborough Fair/Canticle is definitely the best thing on Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme and probably the best Simon and Garfunkel song ever. It is simply gorgeous. Patterns, Homeward Bound and For Emily Wherever I May Find it are good, too, but other songs are quite dated and as someone stated earlier, pretentious."
5,University boys,"While songs like ""A Simple Desultory Philippic"" and ""The 7 O'clock News"" are dated (though the latter is sufficiently chilling so that I don't like to listen to it often), this album contains superb songs and productions. Underrated classics like ""The Dangling Conversation"" and ""Flowers Never Bend With the Rainfall"" blend with some standard S&G greats for a poetic, moody, excellent experience. I miss this sort of sophistication in music now."
1,Buyers beware!!,"As several others reviewers mentioned, this CD title (and also SG's ""Sound of Silence"") is not remastered from original analog master tape as advertised. This overpriced CD sounds exactly like the pre-remastered CD edition from the 1980's. It's atrocious!"
3,Hmmm..let's see..,"""Scarborough Fair"": A Classic.""Homeward Bound"": A Classic.""The 59th Street Bridge Song"": Groovy, but outdated, ya dig? ""For Emily,Whenever I may find her"": One of the best songs they recorded together! ""7 O'Clock News/Silent Night"": I understand the message they were bringing to the youth at that time, but it would've sounded better had they turned the T.V. off.Everything else: Crap."
5,Quite definitively Simon and Garfunkel,Quite definitively Simon and Garfunkel: There is no need to justify this album - it is one of the greatest in folk-rock.
5,Simon and Garfunkel at their best,"Scarborough Fair is the most delicate, beautifly performed song I have ever heard. The poetry in Patterns is so strong, so harrowing, that Paul must have been touched with the ghost of Robert Frost when he wrote it. Finally Silent Night is gorgous in performance, and powerful in it's Peace statement. Simon and Garfunkel fan or not, you are just ignorant if you do not think highly of this cd!"
5,Good Record,"I like it.Reviewing the record is a bit pretentious but this one is on or near the top of my favorite S&Gs;, I have them all on vinyl.The master is even and clear."
5,Wonderful ideas that assist children with autism,"My youngest daughter has autism. Last summer my wife and I brought her to a summer camp. We could not tell our daughter that she was going to spend 5 nights and 6 days at camp because we have no communication system with her. We brought her to camp, left her there with the counselor and she cried. Every morning she packed her bag, lugged it to her counselor and said, Bye Camp"". How would you behave if you were in my daughter's situation?Linda Hodgdon's book, ""Visual Strategies for Improving Communication"", shows parents, educators and other professionals how to use picture schedules, calandars, visual bridges and other visual tools that help my daughter become more aware of what is happening in the world around her.""Visual Stategies for Improving Communication"" is a wonderful book written in an easy to read format showing many examples on how to implement visual tools for children with autism and many other communication and behavior diso! rders"
2,Nothing unique to photography,"This book shows some very basic technique. It barely touches color correction and the retouching examples are so basic that there is nothing more here ultimately than in the User's manual. It is OK for what it does, but it doesn't do much...and why pay 40-50 dollars for what you already have?"
4,"Selection good, but missing songs","I love this book. It has great selections, but, there are some songs in the show that appear to be missing from the song book. Don't get me wrong. I have thoroughly enjoyed this book, but I would like to see songs such as the ""Padre Polka"" and ""Prima Ballerina"""
5,A great resource for every experience level,"One of the best resources that I have found!Walks the reader through the DMAIC process and identifies the Lean and Six Sigma tools that that make up the improvement project tool kit. Shows your where to find the tools in Minitab and how to use them in clear, uncomplicated language. This resource will be very useful to the novice and expert alike.I have recommended this book as a resource to colleagues that I am coaching through Greenbelt certification."
4,Six Sigma and Minitab:,"An excellent resource superbly written. The six sigma techniques are eloquently summarized, and prioritized. The writing style is expertly written, it flows and makes somewhat complex information easily understood. It is not an exhaustive reference but presents the most important main points of every topic in a clear, consise manner. If I had one wish - it would be that the text was twice as thick."
4,Great desk reference!,Was in need of a quick reference book for Minitab. As it'd been some years since i'd used either Statistics or Minitab i needed help getting around. This book more than paid for itself in saving my time in finding/applying tools.
5,Good Reference for Minitab Operations,I purchased two copies after completing Six Sigma Black Belt training. One was damaged in transit. It was replaced quickly and without hassle. The reference is concise and handy.
2,Six Sigma & Mini Tab,"This product is good for quickly referencing very basic information. It contains only the minimum amout of information. Thus, making this a grossly over priced product. An apporpriate price would be closer to $10.00 instead of the current price of about $50.00."
4,Very easy to use,"This toolbox is very easy to use and provide great guidance in the use of Lean Six Sigma different tools, without going too deep in details."
3,Great as an intro to 6Sigma. Not so great for intro to Minitab.,"The title pretty much says it all. I was hoping this would improve my Minitab knowledge and it wasn't so great for that. I already had 6Sigma BB training, so I didn't really need to 6Sigma review, but it does a very good job of it for those that have never had 6Sigma training. So, my advice is don't buy this if you are looking for improving your Minitab knowledge."
3,Not bad,There was definitely some helpful information in this handy guide. I especially liked the summaries and review questions in the back of each section.
2,book was damaged when got it,"The content with in the book was good, yet it was in very poor shape, looked like it got wet and someone had run over it"
4,does the trick....but,"The teeth on this thing are really sharp and it looks great and is rust proof, all good. The only thing that I'm having a problem with is keeping the cheese on the target. If the cheese was fixed in place you could make quick work of it. When you have the cheese and the grater in each hand its hard to keep it from covering a large area. I'm going to have to figure out a way to put a baggie over the exit side, which sort of defeats the purpose a bit."
3,This book was okay,"I thought that this book was fair. It wasn't the best book that I have ever read,but it interested me somewhat at the begining when April was being attacked by a dragon. Then towards the middle the book was getting slower. It didn't talk about much of April's home life. She was mostly in this (magical)fairy tale world fighting Gods and Masters. Some parts were hard to understand. So I would recommend it for kids in the Junior High who like myths and legends."
1,Home made gun book,It looks like someone made this guide in a home office from things thy got off of the Web. A big rip off save your money. They didn't even do the reassembly that is in the name of the guide.
1,Make sure you complete warranty work,"I really regret not having a warranty on this product. I did not realize that there was only a 14 day period alloted to register the manufacturer's warranty. Despite reading all the instructions, 30 minutes into it's first use while plugged into the car's electrical system I smelled electrical smoke and noted that there was no longer a picture. I have never been able to resolve the problem."
2,IT'S NOT THE BRUCE WILLIS VERSION,"I WOULD RATE THIS MOVIE AS A D+, THE ONLY REASON WHY I GOT IT BECAUSE I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO GET A BRUCE WILLIS VERSION"
4,Good movie,"It's a pretty good flick. Anthony Michael Hall could have done a little better, but it isn't his movie. For me, the dvd is worth getting ."
2,LADY KNIGHT,"We have seen scores of movies where the woman or daughter is kidnapped then the husband must use his special ops training skills to rescue them. This movie has a twist where the husband is kidnapped and the woman must go rescue him while obeying the kidnappers.I was not very convinced of Catherine Bell knocking out large men with one punch any more than if Rick Moranis had played the part. She musters all her savvy to save her husband, going nonstop except for the moments she spends calling her daughter assuring her ""mommy will be home soon."" And who uses a 4 digit pass code?I guess if you are a woman and need a super soccer mom role model, or just tired of men playing the ""knight"" this film would have some appeal to you from that angle. It is just that it was so poorly done.Made for TV. Some violence. killing. Basically kid safe."
5,WoW!,I could not put this book down. What I found so amazing about this book was that fact that she wrote it while she was experiencing it and you can really tell. Its just honest and hilarious. I can't wait to read the next one.
4,"A Good, Quick Read for Kids 8-12","As the age suggestion inside this book suggests, this is a good book for children ages 8-12. It's short, sort of cute and maybe just a little bit scary..."
3,Average from Goldsmith,"I certainly didn't enjoy this as much as I did Bestseller or Young Wives Club, but it was still an ok read. This is a story about 3 siblings who are not very impressed that their widowed mum is leaving Florida and coming to live with them in NY. She is loud, brash, aggressive, strong-minded and always sticks her nose into places where they don't belong. The three decide to set up Operation Geezer Quest, a plan to get their mum to marry and old, rich man so she can be looked after..well away from them. Basically, the story goes on about how this mission is accomplished but at the same time bringing the family closer together.It is quite a funny book and it is short so you can finish it in one sitting. It is entertaining and cleverly written but it is nowhere near as good as other Goldsmith's books - still a good book to read if you have a few hours to kill."
1,I was skimming it towards the end...,"There wasn't a single character in this book that I honestly liked and wanted to root for. I got the feeling the author dashed this book off over a long weekend. Didn't she write the First Wive's Club? THAT book was funny and had real characters, not boring cardboard cutouts."
3,Candidate for Movie-of-the-Week,"A quick, easy book that reads like a made-for-TV movie. Corny dialogue, but a fun story."
3,Good start - lame finish,"I started this book thinking I was really going to like it. The first half was entertaining with some genuinely funny lines. But the last half was so absurd that I was greatly disappointed. Without revealing too much, let's just say that the boundless good fortune of every single character (both major and minor) left me wondering why the author couldn't have thrown in a dash of reality for a better mix"
5,"Wonderful, light read! Perfect for Summer.","Throughout this lightwieght surprising book, I found myself saying ""Oh my God! What would I do?"" It didn't matter if it was from the desparate children's perspective or from putting myself in the mother's shoes. After all, she only wants to ""fix their lives."" With that diabolical premise, the possibilities are endless.The characters are neurotically fleshed out, and the relationships are wonderfully drawn. Mrs. Katz is priceless. Months later, I still find her and her big purse popping into my thoughts. I wish them all the best of luck.I was still laughing as I handed the book to my mother who passed it to her sister. As with the movie ""Home for the Holidays,"" amidst the laughs, I appreciated my family even more."
2,"ridiculous, predictable plot","As others have said, this started off promising and quickly became absurd and predictable. I almost didn't finish it because I wasn't enjoying the second half."
4,"not her best, but excellent nonetheless","Predictably long, however, when the book is by Olivia Goldsmith, so much the better. Excellent."
2,Way too corny and unbelievable,"I was really looking forward to reading another Olivia Goldsmith book, but this one just didn't do it for me. I love the author's other books, but this one seemed too rushed, too quick, without much thought given to the plot or the characters -- like she was just in a hurry to get another book out. This book was too unvelievable and predictable."
4,Light but brilliant,"Less substantial than most of Goldsmith's comedy, Marrying Mom is P.G. Wodehouse transplanted to 1990s Manhattan. The ironic juxtaposition of the frothy, superoptimistic plot (ably described by other reviewers) with characters who are, well, amply endowed with frailties is a rich reward for the investment of a few hours. I only hope that Ms. Goldsmith's energy holds out long enough for half as many volumes as Mr. Wodehouse's."
1,Attractive but doesn't fit,The light is attractive although the round part used to mount it against the wall is not large enough in diameter to clear our electrical junction box mounting flanges and screws so it won't sit flush with the wall.
3,Wagner for Generation-DC,"This is a ""graphic-novel"" adaptation of all four segments of Wagner's famous ""Ring"" cycle operas, which at least partly inspired Tolkien's Ring books. It's nicely laid out, with some traditional pages and other full-page spreads, though I think the actual illustrations could be more detailed and creative, esp. at this price! However, it is a nice intro to a famous and complicated story, and fairly easy to follow. Parents who may consider this for their children, however, should beware; the Rhine-maidens are unabashedly naked! Recommended for Ring fans and comic junkies."
5,A children's classic that can shape your life.,"I first came upon Toni's book one day by accident. Intrigued after looking through the chapter content, I purchased the book and found myself deeply effected by the author's observations. I have to confess, I wasn't really familiar with the story of the ""Velveteen Rabbit"", as I never had that story introduced to me as a child. I wish I had, as there is some real power behind the story's message. Toni Raiten-D'Antonio does a great job in the book illustrating how this children's classic has a great message for children and adults alike. I highly recommend this book."
5,We all need to aspire to be Real,This is a quick and easy read on complex subjects that leaves the reader with a compass for continued thought and development. The table of contents speaks for itself. Life has little meaning without values.
2,The Velveteen Principles,"I was disappointed in the content. I had purchased 6 sets hoping to give the books as gifts at Christmas. After reading the Velveteen Prinicples, I returned 5 sets."
5,"Solid system, easy to follow instructions","I spent A LOT of time researching basketball systems. I wanted: 1) a sturdy, quality system that will grow with my boys (7 and 3 1/2) and last a long time; 2) easy height adjustment; 3) a good price; and 4) easy-to-follow instructions. So far, this system has fit all of my criteria. It's very sturdy and nice quality, we can adjust the height easily and smoothly with one hand, great Amazon price, and you can't beat free shipping (the box weighed 100 lbs., and the nice UPS driver put it in the garage for us -- better than schlepping it home from a sporting goods store!#, and the instructions were very clear and EASY to follow #and I am not a mechanical person). The boys LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the system, and I hope that we'll have years of family fun shooting hoops!"
2,Bad packaging,"The Lifetime 71553 arrived damaged: there were over 25 scraps and gouges and the middle of the pole was so bent that I spent an hour trying to get it round enough to fit into the bottom portion of the pole. I had to paint the unit to prevent rust. The directions were poorly written and sometimes just wrong. When I informed them of the errors, they were not interested. Once assembled and painted, it functions well and seems to be sturdy enough to last. I like the ease with which it adjusts and it is stable."
4,Nice birthday theme book,"Mrs. Funnybunny takes PJ and his friends off to a birthday party. Along the way, all the friends take turns discussing what would be the best party ever.After each of PJ's friends expresses his opinion, Mrs. Funnybunny agrees with him and tells them that that will, indeed, be at PJ's party, too.But, as they pass each mentioned activity, Mrs. Funnybunny drives right past.Where could Mrs. Funnybunny be going?There are no major surprises in this book - just a sweet children's book about a birthday party. I'd recommend it for a birthday present for a child in the 3-6 age group."
3,Cool,My three year old loves this book and talk about how she wants to have a cool birthday just like PJ. The book has PJ and his friends guessing what the big surprise is for his birthday.
5,MAXELL CD-403 COLOR SLEEVES,MAXELL CD-403 MULTI-COLOR CD/DVD SLEEVES WERE VERY GOOD QUALITY AND SHIPMENT ARRIVEBEFORE ARRIVAL DATE. THE PRICE WAS VERY REASONABLE TOO.
3,"Good for the price, depends on what you need them for though",The paper in these sleeves are thinner than some of the other products I've bought previously. They're still brightly colored though and inexpensive. It will depend on how much protection and sturdiness you're looking for. I put DVDs in these and then place them right in a storage box so I wasn't look for a huge amount of protection. These worked just fine for what I wanted.
5,Color is good,"What can be said? I purchased the colored sleeves because of the price. However, it does give one the ability to segregate the different CD's by category."
5,Good product.,"I reviewed a number of DVD sleeves before purchasing these. Many of the reviews for the less expensive sleeves referred to poorly sealed windows and tissue thin paper stock. So, even though they were a few dollars more, I purchased these. They are worth the additional few dollars. The paper gauge is sturdy and the transparent windows are well bonded. I'm glad I took the time to evaluate as these are well constructed."
3,Too thin,"I bought 2 other types of CD sleeves and I thought o paper sleeves what could be so different. These does the job yes, but the paper is much thinner than the other kinds."
5,Colorful and Easy to use,These are great. The colors are really bright so you can see them quickly. I use these when I want to give someone a dvd or cd. No complaints!
4,Exceptional Utility,"These DVD sleeves are well-constructed for something made from paper. The clear window is helpful to read title and data information you may have written on the media inside. I like the multi-colored envelopes as it helps with organization and my collection of media does not look as bland. While there are better sleeves out there made of plastic or vinyl, they are also a bit (not much) more costly. The value of these sleeves, ease-of use and performance are solid."
4,Made well and colorful.,"These fit well, are sturdy enough, and the window is big enough to see the writing on the CD. However, I found some where the top edges were glued a little and I couldn't get the disk to slip in. It just took a moment to separate the edge and I was good to go. I bought the same ones a few years ago with the same problem, but the quality is still good."
3,OK,"Can't screw up product, it is what it is, but can claim a good price and good packaging, serve the purpose"
3,"Convenient, but slippery","I like the convenience of having these handy. That being said, I had to buy some hard rubber ones, for two reasons:1- They are somewhat slippery. Unless the weight of the trailer gets on it before it starts slipping, it becomes useless (no matter how well you jam it under the tire), especially on slick concrete or re-sealed asphalt.2- They are actually too attractive. Someone I know had them stolen from under his trailer. I guess you could tie them to the trailer."
1,Buyer Beware : shop vac filter,"Total waste of $. Specifications on line matched my shop vac(s). In reality. NO. TOtally worthless - so why invest more money in return. Very disappointed. Waste of time and $. Vendor, feel free to make it right."
1,Does not fit,"As many people have noted, this is not the correct replacement filter for the Craftsman 16 gallon shop vac. It has no hole on the bottom. Buyer beware. I typed in the number for the filter from my shop vac and this one came up. It advertises that it fits, but it does not."
3,Not two!,I wouldn't have paid $20 for one filter. I think Amazon should have taken that post off. I feel they owe me a filter.
1,Does not fit Craftsman Shop Vac!!!!!,"The ad says: ""Replacement cartridge filter designed for Rigid and Craftsman wet/dry vacuums""The arrived product reads: ""Does not fit (Caraftsmans) Shop wet/dry vacs""Improperly advertised. This will not work. Bummer."
2,shop vac filter,its very hard to clean I have to use a brush to clean the filter like the craftsman I can knock it on side and all debree falls off it
5,Ignore the crybabies,"This filter is designed to fit old Craftsman shop vacs. They fit and they work. No they don't have a hole like the ones that originally came with the vac, because these have been designed to fit without requiring the thumbscrew. These are EASIER to install than the originals. Good grief, how do some of these folks even manage to tie their own shoes?"
4,decent generic filter,"Overall a decent generic filter for a shop vac. It was a bit longer than the original one I had for the Ridgid shop vac, but its better made than some other cheap filters I got over the years."
1,Warning: Does NOT fit 6 gal Craftsman!!,WARNING: The technical details for this filer are not accurate. It says:Replacement cartridge filter designed for Rigid and Craftsman wet/dry vacuumsFor wet and dry useReplacement filterFits all tanks 6 gallons on upI have a 3 year-old 6 gallon Craftsman wet/dry and this found this filter was not even close to fitting as a replacement for the original. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning it. :-(
2,Not really for standard ridgid vac,"I have two Ridgid vacs and this one really doesn't fit either one. yes the diameter of the filter is correct so that it will fit on, but it is too long and has a metal cap on the end so that it can't be secured with the standard retaining nut even is a hole is drilled in the end cap to fit the retaining bolt through"
3,replacement for sears filter,"This was listed as a replacement for a 17804 filter for an older Sears 16 gallon vac. This filter is 2"" smaller in diameter and about 1"" shorter. It required the following modifications: drill a 1/4"" hole in the metal cap and apply 1/2"" foam tape around the open end to make up for the height difference. I will see how this works over time."
2,Does NOT fit all Ridgid shop vacs as stated,One of the reviewers stated they had to drill a hole in the bottom plate of this in order to make it fit. They were right - this thing has a solid metal plate at one end of the filter cartridge. My 9 gallon Ridgid requires a filter that is open at both ends because the vacuum cleaner has a plastic retainer plate and a nylon nut to hold the filter onto the machine.This is a complete misrepresentation by the vendor; a more complete description and picture of the filter showing both ends would have made it easier to determine if this filter fits my machine.It's going back for a full refund.
1,One star to Amazon's search engine,"This review is not for the filter. It's for Amazon's search engine!I was looking for '17884 filter craftsman' and this product came up. BTW, 17884 is the number I found on the vacuum container for a filter replacement.It does NOT match my Craftsman 6 gallon Wet/Dry vacuum. The ID and OD are too small and it's too tall to fit my vacuum. Specified dimensions are odd for a hollow cylindrical part, 7in x 7in x 7in ? Or is it for the box it was in?Anywho... I guess I gotta get it from HD to get the correct one :)"
3,Fit my shop vac.,Fits my shop vac and works. Nothing special. As an added filter I zip tied a cut Kirby vacuum bag around the filter to keep drywall dust particles from re-entering my home and or any allergens.
1,NOT SIZE IT SAYS......,"This is NOT 7x7, it is 7 x 8 1/2 and no center hole in the bottom plate. Be careful this doesn't fit the vacs they say it does........"
1,sent back wrong size and went to hoimedepot to get one,sent back wrong size and went to homedepot to get one also the sponge for the outside was wrong too !
4,shop vac filter,"came on time, it was taller then the spects, but worked just by pushing it on so it worked ok"
5,Great Product,"I haven't gotten to experience using these because I bought them as a gift, but they seem to be very sturdy and well-made. I really like how this set includes 2/3 and 3/4 cups. Also, I have no complaints about the dimensions of the cups as has been previously mentioned. I own a set of $30 measuring cups from a specialty kitchen store and they are the same shape as these."
5,Really Nice!,"I love them. My old set didn't stack, I had to have two piles of them, and so I am really enjoying using these well made, heavy stainless steal, stackable measuring cups. They have a few one star reviews by users who said the handles fell off. Maybe they used their cups harder than I do mine. Anyway, I searched the internet and these where the set with the most cup sizes and were stackable too. These cups take up much less drawer space than my old ones did, and my handles are fine. I recommend them."
5,Best Measuring Cup Set Available,"I love these. They are made of quality stainless steel and have the measurements etched into the handles. They have nice long handles which I find very useful at times. I love that the set includes the 2/3 and 3/4 cups, unlike cheaper sets. I am very happy with this set. You can get cheaper sets, but these are well worth the extra price."
4,"Pricey, but worth it.","These are a little pricey for measuring cups, but well worth the money. They'll last longer than about any other measuring cup set out there, and the odd sizes (2/3 cup, 3/4 cup) make this the most convenient set of measuring cups we've had yet."
5,A good choice,"I read the previous reviews and then chose the long-handled stainless steel measuring cups. I already have a quality set of basic sizes, so now I have the odd sizes in stainless instead of plastic. They go in the dishwasher, and the long handles actually make it easier to scoop and measure food. This one is a winner!"
4,Good set.,"Overall good set of measuring cups, with wide variety of sizes. Easy to clean, but heavy when stacked all together."
5,Really Nice!!,"To start, my package got here pretty quickly with standard shipping through regular postal service during the Christmas rush, so I'm very happy about that.I haven't used these yet as they're part of a gift for my husband, but upon inspection, they're really beautiful. They're also nice and heavy; great quality. I don't imagine we'll be replacing these any time soon. I would recommend these to anyone who's looking for a really nice set of measuring cups."
1,TOTAL JUNK! handles break off,"these are total junk. After a year of use, the handles are breaking off just from digging into to a flour or sugar bag. The handles break off at the point they are attached to the cup."
4,Like these a lot! Actually I give them 4 1/2....,"I bought this set because of the odd sized cups that are included. (and they were on sale...)They are well made (three point welds attach the handles - Calphalon uses 2)), nest nicely so I can hang them all on the same hook, and are quite attractive...If there is a downside, it's that they are a little wider and shallower than I prefer (the Calphalon cups will nest inside their equivalents), so I knocked them down a bit.. But perhaps that's just me being picky...Quite pleased, overall...;0))PK"
1,Listen to SlowShopper below!!!!,"I bought a set of these about 1.5 years ago, then decided to get my mother a set for her birthday a few months ago. The quality is now a 1/4 of what is was before - the weight and spot welds of these cups no longer justify their price. That's a pity - because at one point in time these were very well made. If I catch MIU abusing their brand on another product, I'll be done with them completely.In the mean time, I recommend that you pass on these measuring cups."
3,"Sadly, not made in France but still some nice measuring cups","The cups look great and nest very nicely for storage. I was specifically looking for some that were either made in the USA, England or France. Once they were opened I found that they are made in China. Not exactly what I was looking for but they are still nice."
4,Very Nice Measuring Cups,"These are very well made, and I love the long handles. They are polished on the outside, and you can tell that it's very high quality stainless steel, without being too thick and heavy like the All-Clad or Cuisipro brands of measuring cups. My only complaint is that they are not labeled with metric measurements, which I occasionally use. But otherwise, a wonderful set! Would buy this again."
2,MIU France 7-pieces,"This measuring cups is way over price. I just got mine today and the stainless steel cups is thin and light, not 18/10 as stated. The knife went through the heart when I saw that it was made in China!!!!!!!!!(that was how dissapointed I felt). I rated it a 2 stars because I like the 3/4 cup option, otherwise a 1 star for me."
4,Great!,"Had plastic, and finally grew up to steel measuring cups! I love them. I have all the sizes I need. No more trying to remember 4th grade math. :)"
5,Sturdy and attractive measuring cups.,"I bake/ cook frequently. I purchased 2 sets so I would be able to cook multiple dishes at the same time without washing up. They seem to hold a slightly larger volume than my older measuring cups (the welded handles fell off). Not sure how to verify the volume sizing.They are sturdy, have a good weight, flat bottoms and nice long handles. They are also attractive and love that they have several additional cups of common measurements in the set as well. Very happy with my purchase."
1,Handle broken on deliver/spot weld worthless,For $29 dollars not a good deal. First the stainless steal was light weight and the spot weld was cheaply done. I returned product to Amazon because I would think sooner or later the other handles would fall off. This item would be worth only 3.00 at a flea market.
5,I love it,Beautiful message with extraordinary artwork. This is a lovely message for young and old alike. I gave it as a gift this Christmas to my grandchild.
1,Misleading Packaging,The packaging for this car adapter says that it will convert 5 volts. It doesen't. There is no 5 volt adapter included.
4,Universal Car Power adapter,"The adapter is great with multiple settings for different voltages. Saves on replacing batteries constantly for my portable speakers. One negative is the ""bulbous"" size sticking out of the DC plugin. I added a DC plug ""Y"" splitter so I can plug this in and hang it out of the way. It would also be nice if there was some on-board storage for the different plug tips- they will get lost."
4,Cool,I have this letter opener. It is fun on my desk. I just wish it were sharper to open those pesky envelopes.
2,Low Quality Replacement,"After moderate use each year, this is the third replacement blade in the last 5 years. We mainly make emulsions like pestos or dressings. Nothing that would cause stress on the blade.Issue:- The steel rivets that hold the blade to plastic cylinder is the culprit. The blade cracks around the rivet and a the thin chunk of it will finally fall off and into your food. It seems to have a flawed design.- If you want an example of what I am talking about check out the picture I posted on the unit.- A couple years ago we found steel shards in our basil pesto sauce. Someone almost ATE IT! Now we check for such an issue after each use.As a side note, we don't put this blade in the dish washer, we hand wash it.I guess $15/year is not bad maintain a $200 kitchen appliance that we use a lot. My only issue is that my previous Cuisinart Processor had a blade that lasted 30 years. Sad!"
5,sharp!,I'm glad my old blade broke as I didn't know how dull it was until I got the new one! The price was super and shipping fast. Thanks Amazon.
5,Heaven sent for group camping,"Does what it's designed to do. It makes great coffee at your campsite.It brews fast (ten minutes) on a Coleman stove that's protected by a windscreen.However, my pot once took 45 minutes to finish on a mismatched burner/grill setup.One windy morning, brewing didn't even start until I improvised extensive wind protection.Once you get the setup right, you'll be delighted with the results.As other reviews note, you must keep the pot handle centered.I pour the brew into a pump Thermos dispenser so others don't touch the carafe.""Roughing it"" once meant enduring percolated coffee.Thank you Coleman for your gift to outdoor Java Joes."
3,Not as good as the Prophet,The first one was the masterpiece while this book is just the wrapper. The bulk of Gibran's truths are in the original Prophet.
3,Graphic SF Reader,"I am still not much of a FF fan. Fun use of some of the Marvel staff in here though. The Trial of Reed Richards is certainly cool. Many cosmic entities thrown in for cameos, and that sort of thing. This is just more out and out Fantastic Four silliness, and some really really bad Johnny Storm clothes."
4,Byrne fans won't be disappointed,"If you're a fan of Byrne, these stories certainly will not disappoint you, although they could have chosen better yarns to put together in a TPB. Most of these are slightly above average -- the Ego battle, the revelation that Frankie Raye is a human torch, and the Inhumans moving Attilan to the Blue Area of the Moon -- but the others are just average. For a ""Visionaries"" TPB, you expect top-notch vignettes. You get it here....almost."
4,Great for new cigar collector!,"If you're looking for something to start a cigar collection then this is a great value! Good quality for the price and it comes with great accessories, like a cigar cutter, a leather travelling case (not sealed, meant for quick travel) and a nice wooden ash tray for three cigars. I bought it this christmas for my brother, who has just started to get into cigars. Someone I know, who collects cigars and owns a larger humidor, looked over it for me to make sure it wasn't a piece of crap. He said that as long as the humidor is seasoned properly (do your research) it is a great item for the beginning collector. He did say that if someone who would be using it wanted to save their cigars longer than a couple of months, this product isn't the most ideal. The seals are decent, but not for very long term storage. Overall, the best value I found for the casual cigar smoker!"
3,Fuel Filler,"It is practical gadget, helps you to avoid mess when filling gas lanterns. It is nothing really special, but good to have it and is not overpriced."
1,Junk or I'm missing something.,"I see all these wondrous reviews, with a few exceptions, and then I try it. It leaks everywhere and requires too much pressure to start the flow through the spout. I'm using a brand new can of Coleman fuel, the funnel and seal look normal, and I've made sure to securely tighten the funnel. It still leaks like a sieve as soon as I tilt the can. Has anyone figured out why some of us are finding it unusable?"
2,Leaks and spills fuel all over,"Maybe it arrogance or just being lazy, I keep hopping that each time I use this thing it will live up to it reputation and not spill a drop. However, it never does. Leaks at every point that there is a crack, not a lot but a definite puddle of fuel. Then when you remove it (from the lantern or stove), splash more fuel comes out. Never liked it after the first use, but its become a staple joke at our camp as for how much fuel it spills. We almost take bets on how much."
1,do not match with EU Coleman bottle,"Unfortunately this fuel filler do not match with European Coleman fuel bottle, it is unusable in Europe."
2,Unneeded Funnel,"When my Coleman stove arrived, it came with a funnel. There was no need to purchase this additional funnel whose shipping charge was about the same as the cost of the funnel."
2,Not enough general review,"The book has some basic review of lovebirds but fills the rest of the book with explanations of genetics and the mutations and pictures of all the lovebird mutations. It wasn't particularly what I was looking for. I wanted to know their habits, personalities, etc. as I was not looking to breed lovebirds."
5,Lovebird Guide,This Lovebird book is a perfect guide for all who love lovebirds. I have 4 lovebirds and this book made me understand how they are and what to expect. The Guide is easy to understand and have many pictures as well. I do recommend this Book.Delivery was perfect!
1,Misprinted... What a Shame,The 4 set of bars are flipped.3 bars are on the lower right.It's a shame to have this kind of flag.It's like having 50 stars on the lower right on the US Flag.I ordered 2 and trashed them all.
5,Elegant and Efficient,"The cheese course is all the rage for this fall and winter, and this cheese cleaver makes an elegant and efficient way to serve semi-firm to firm cheeses at the table or on a buffet. The Henckels design and quality are apparent in the look and feel of this lovely piece. I especially like to use this tool to serve a nice cheddar or smoked provolone with apple or pear halves, allowing guests to cut pieces of fruit and cheese for their plates. This also makes a great hostess gift, especially when paired with a wedge of your personal favorite from the local fromage shoppe."
5,sad man sad songs sad listener,i got a copy of this from the salvation army for a dollar. it wins the award for best back cover art ever. also the music is good.
2,is this a joke?,"Ok,If I were to walk into the studio during the recording of this nonsense I would beckon Cohen to halt for a few minutes . I would approach him, put my arm around his neck and say, ""Now Cohen, you're not actually taking this seriously are you? This is a JOKE, right?""If he answers yes, then we are laughing together. If he says, ""No,"" well then this is the biggest collection of poorly written, vomit inducing, pretentious lyrics that have ever been put to music. The recording and music is subtley soothing and harmonious; even his voice (a poor man's crooner) is nice. However, the lyrics are flat out ridiculous and could have been written by any semi - literate on the street. There is NOTHING, I repeat, NOTHING extraordinary about his writing. Shame, thought I might have discovered another musician whose work I could further explore. Instead I found a phony."
4,heart aching and beautiful. a true master of word,"i first heard of cohen when he was referenced by kurt cobain. after checking him out i bought this album. i was taken away. this album is extrordinary. escpecially lyrically. let me just say that it got only a four because a) people are too generous with 5's and b) the middle 3 songs don t match up to the rest. that being said this album is great. lyrically few songs ever rival it. how many artist today can write songs with complex rhyme schemes and intangible metaphors. his voice is also moving. favorit tracks include 'master song' 'stories of the street' 'stranger song' and the final 'hey. one of us cannot be wrong' this album is a must for any song writer, lover of truly good music, one who enjoys poetry, or any essential colleciton."
5,A Voice To Send Shivers Down Your Spine,"I have to admit, the first time I heard this album I was nonplussed. This is it? A guy strumming a guitar and singing quietly? Why is this album rated so highly? I forced myself to keep coming back to it, and I am glad that I did. My girlfriend at the time had a much better ear for these things. I was playing this album when she returned home. ""Who is this?"" she asked. ""His voice sends shivers down my spine.""Let's face it: Leonard Cohen is not only a good songwriter, but what really makes his work shine is the fact that he's a great poet. This stuff is up there - I'm serious - with the Whitmans and Blakes of this world. I have been fed tea and oranges by the Suzannes of this world; I reached to the sky just to surrender; I have sought out the teachers of the heart - there is so much deep wisdom in Cohen's words that they make me ache with that greatest of mixtures: pain and desire."
5,Your lovely journey,The first and finest instalment of one of the most beautiful odysseys in popular music. This whole record is a mysterious and magical domain. One of those very rare discoveries that becomes part of your life.
5,Still poetic,Had the vinyl disc when this first came out.Brilliant lyrics and compelling performance by Mr. Cohen that is still effective
4,His `Talking' style of singing fits Cohen's words well enough,"The Songs of Leonard Cohen: All the songs on this CD were written by Leonard Cohen and this release became very influential on the whole `singer songwriter' movement of the late 60's and early 70's. However, this is an album I respect more than I enjoy."
2,Somewhat disappointed.,"The bat house is built solid, but with inferior materials. The back board is regular plywood which swells when it becomes wet. The screws holding together are not stainless and will rust. It is not worth the asking price in my opinion."
4,Good bat house,"The Bat House arrived as shown in the photo. Appears well constructed. I strongly advise consumer to seal the exterior wood, especially the back which is made of plywood. The Plywood Is top quality, though here in S.E. Texas it would not last 1 year without preservation."
1,Don't buy!,"This product only works when your car is turned on. Dang, I need it working when my car is turned off and parked outside of my apartment when I'm at home sleeping. What good is it when it has to work when I'm already driving my car? Useless."
3,Great music---poor sound,"The sound issue is due to an issue that existed from the first pressing of the LP. The sound was thin and trebley---without dimension. There was a number of Columbia records that came out about the same time that sounded similar. My theory is that the Master tape wasn't mixed right, or it was mixed for radio play--because the single off the album sounded better on the radio than it did on my home stereo. This is an album that needs to be ""restored""--a re-mix or a re-eq is not going to be enough. There is some great music on this album. It needs to be saved and done justice."
4,great band great songs great cd,"alot of bands tried to mix rock and soul few got it right even janis seemed like a pale imitator, the rascals had it in there blood and so did this group, it doesn't seem like an experiment or a concept album just a good old fashioned party album, great riffs, vocals, drumming and soulful horn blast. bottom line GET IT!!!!!"
3,This Release Seemed Better When I Was Younger,"I am the only woman I know who is familiar with Electric Flag. Although I liked this album, it was not one of my favorites when I purchased it. But, the Flag's rendition of ""Texas"" is phenomenal. That song alone makes ""A Long Time Comin'"" well worth its price and, 30 years later, it sounds just as fabulous. (Amazon.com should have included ""Texas"" as one of the song clips. Big, HUGE, mistake!)"
1,Buyer Beware,"This being one of my favorite cd's I was excited when I saw this available as a remastered import from Sony.However, when I put it on it sounded terrible. The highs were so screechy that the cd was unlistenable and lets not talk about the non-existent bass. I do have the original Columbia issue and compared to this ""remastered version"" the original sounds like an audiophile cd. Not really but this is how bad this thing sounds. In looking at the credits it appears that the same person did the remastering on both. I am guessing that the import is nothing more than a digital dub from way back when. Do yourself a favor and just get the Columbia/Legacy remastered compilation. It has 99 9/10 of the origial album and it sounds great. Happy listening"
2,"""Remastered""","I ordered the import version of this CD (Sony Holland, English language label) because it was listed as ""remastered"" and I assumed it would have better fidelity than the domestic release. I have never heard the domestic version but it cannot be any worse than the import. Very tinny highs, not much bass. The original vinyl probably sounds better."
4,Amercian Music,"Must have for any Mike Bloomfield or Buddy Miles fan. The liner notes say that the Electric Flag is an ""American Music Band"" and I would definitely agree. This disc has a great combo of all the things that make American Music great. Blues, Rock, Jazz, guitar, harmonica, drums. What else can you say?"
3,Music worth groovin' to,"I would agree that Electric Flag defies tidy categorization, and isn't a blues band per se (sorta like calling the Doors a psychedelic band). Still, non-blues fans may be a bit bored with 4 or 5 cuts on this CD. But ""Groovin' is Easy"" alone is worth the price -- it's the best damn song of 60s."
3,Just Fair Sounding,"As others have noted, this CD is pretty tinny-sounding. No real bass/bottom. But, what can you expect for 6 bucks? I listened to it for a couple of times to reminisce back to high school days. This isn't exactly a CD I'll be listening to very often."
3,comic relief,This book is great for laughing out loud and then deciding to figure out where lies the truth.
4,Perfect book to discover Long Island City's past,"I have visited Long Island City frequently and wondered what it looked like in the past. This book captures the historical attributes of this area of Astoria, Queens."
1,Worst book about South America I've ever read.,"This is honestly an apalling, inaccurate and blinkered view of South America. Lydia Laube seems to be unable to see the beauty in the simplicity of the continent, and she writes about the people and their lives as though they are idiotic, and beneath her.I fail to understand how this book was approved for publication, and I would recommend if you are considering purchasing this book - DON'T!"
1,lifeless,"I was disappointed in this book. Although I have travelled through South America and can relate to some of her desriptions, I felt the book was just a string of descriptions. I could not relate to her feelings. I felt distanced. It was dry and boring."
2,Nothing but Common Sense,"Somehow the authors manage to fill several hundred pages without ever saying anything interesting or beyond the level of common sense. The authors seem to try to avoid discussing specifics, but talking about user interfaces in general terms has very little value in my opinion. I'm sure there are many better books available on this topic, so my advice is to keep looking!"
5,A heart-warming story,"I met Galen Kindley at Tacoma Mall where he was signing copies of his first book, Hearts of the Morning Calm. As I struggled to hold on to my 20 month old grandson, Galen and I discussed his book. I hesitated to purchase it as it didn't seem like my type of book, but was taken in by his enthusiam and also intrigued by the story. This book was just a wonderful story to read. It left me wishing that the book didn't end. I wanted the story of Jason and Kwang Young to continue on. It is a great blend of humor, romance, history and culture lessons put into a format that keeps the reader interested right to the last page. I recommend it to everyone who likes to read a book and keep feeling good about it. It's not something you will read and forget about right away. Galen Kindley is on to a great start as an author. I can hardly wait for the next book to come out."
2,There are better books out there.,"I didn't like this book, much more writing than pictures, many of the pictures in black and white instead of color. Hajo Duchting's book is better and I recommend that instead of this one."
4,Be ware of the handle!,"This knife fails in the ergonomics department. See that loop-like handle from the picture? Imagine you gripping it hard and you palm will start to complain because of the pressure exerted at the edges. Contrast this to a knife with solid, round handle.Over the time I have already get used to this by holding the knife more skillfully, but I figure that I should share this design flaw with you.Finally, I also want to add that this is a good cheese knife if I only evaluate the blade. So get it if you don't mind having to adjust to the weird shape of the handle. (Henckels must be trying to save material to cut the cost...)"
5,Great for Cheese and Other Utility Uses,"I like this knife so much, I find myself looking for reasons to use it. Perfect for preparing grilled Hallumi. Slice the Hallumi cheese, put it in the pan at medium hi heat, and slice the tomatoes, as thin as you please. When the cheese is golden brown on both sides, put it on the tomato slices, drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with oregano. Just remember, since this is a serrated blade, best cutting effect is to be had by drawing the blade across what you are cutting and not just pressing down. At least that is true with tomatoes and some cheeses. YMMV."
5,Description,"""..a month-by-month chronicle of events in one woman's life, in her Connecticut house set in a meadow bounded by a rushing brook and hills covered with maples and hemlocks. It tells about her neighbors, her hisband and their visiting children and grandchildren; about winter nights by the fire with books and handiwork, summer days in the garden or on the not-too-distant beach;.."""
5,"Amazing, catchy tune that gets you in the mood for dancing.","""Get get down"" is truly a masterpiece. No matter what the mood you're in, just listening to this song will get you in a clubbing mood."
5,Be ready,"to be totally amazed. I came across Spray Nine working in a weird machine-shop factory many years ago. It melted ink out of anything...and I restore caars and have found any grease, any stain...anything..Spray Nine can clean. Its simply amazing. I have tried every cleaner available, Resolves, 3m products, Simple Green, dry cleaner fluids, everything for oily,difficult stains. Nothing works like Spray Nine....you will actually be shocked at how stains fade and are gone & released...."
5,Really like this product for tough stains...,"I bought it to use on vinyl siding on my house, but seems to work well for virtually any mess that I've encountered..the disinfectant properties are just a plus....not too expensive to me, and will buy again."
5,Vampire Kn ight Guilty,I love the first season and the second season is no disappointment. The way Zero has a love for Yuri and to keep her safe from vampires even though he was turned is heart warming. Kuran wh is also protecting her is hlding a secert and I won't give that away for those who haven't seen it yet. The sad part is it only has four episodes but the second disk will be out the 17Th on May. I promise you will not go wrong with this series....
2,Disappointed,"I'll first add that I bought the complete first season collection of Vampire Knight, and I had some good hopes for Vampire Knight Guilty. The last episode I watched versus the first episode in this series...completely doesn't add up. Not to mention, a lot of stuff I'd seen in the Vampire Knight box set is being repeated in Vampire Knight Guilty...which shouldn't have really happened, if they wanted to be consistent. For example, going to the gala event? Yuki helping the little boy find his mom? Was in the first season. What the hell. :|"
1,Get Over Yourself Dude,"""With 22 tracks sprawling over 74 arse-numbing minutes, Cripple Crow is hopelessly self-indulgent. It's a pity, because on the few occasions when Banhart applies the quality control - as on the short but pretty 'Dragonflies' - he shows flashes of McCartney-esque melodic craft. Generally, though, Banhart is happiest when he's wasting an hour and a quarter of your valuable time with his witless meandering and irritating stoner-drawl. """"Already this year we have heard the awesome Amadou & Mariam record on which producer Manu Chao brilliantly fuses western pop sensibilities with ethnic sounds to create fresh and invigorating music. In comparison, Banhart's feeble grasp of world/folk music comes across as a shoddy, flashy sweatshop counterfeit.""It's probably this month's top-seller in Tower Records of Goa, however."
1,i don't like this,This guy's voice is lame. i like the beatles and the rolling stones and etta james. they are real singers. My cousin played this cd for me and took me to go see him live and he took his shirt off and sang in an annoying tone. he was not very good and annoyed me. The same thing happened when my cousin took me to see bright eyes. he was so boring we both left. after two songs. all he did was sing like crap and take swigs from a wine bottle he kept beside his mic stand. the band before him was good they. they are called rilo kiley. jenny lewis sings like an angel
3,More funny than useful,"I bought this recommended book for my Histology class at the University of Copenhagen. At first it was fun to read the authors' dedication of the book to different winemakers, but eventually I grew tired of the endless joking around. The actual core text is not very in-depth but the illustrautions are beautiful, thus the mediocre rating. And another thing, the book is useless when it comes to the central nervous system."
1,What an awful book!,"This may seem quite strange but it is true.Reading this book i was totally terrified that histology could be a dificult and demanding task to deal with.But to my own surprise, i surpassed this obstracle with the help of another totally unknown book called "" Basic Histology"" by Adonis Kalligaropoulos.I recommend it to you if you want to acquire a clear and simple idea of histology and take an A in your exams."
1,silver earrings,"this seller does not give the size, of the jewelry, becausethe items I got, including these earrings, were very small/tiny.These were so small one can hardly make out what they are.I asked for a refund quite some time ago and have not received it yet."
5,a must-read to prepare for surgery and recovery,"I would highly recommend this book to anyone preparing for cosmetic surgery. It covers a variety of areas which I found very helpful, such as choosing my surgeon and preparing for recovery. I really liked Susan Gail's writing style - its down to earth and patient-friendly, yet at the same time its step-by-step approach was a tremendous help for me to get focused and organized. A definite must-have!"
5,"Cosmetic Surgery Before, Between and After","Susan is not intimidated by M.D. after a person's name. Sharing her own experience in an honest and practical way, we learn what to expect when and if we decide to have cosmetic surgery.They say that a picture is worth a thousand words and Susan shares the good the bad and the ugly side of surgery with the reader using herself as the model.I believe that every Plastic Surgeon and Cosmetic Surgeon should have a copy of this book in their waiting room."
5,Cosmetic Surgery,"I just finished reading Cosmetic Surgery book (Before, Between and After). LOVED it!! I found it to be absolutely informative while fun, clever and brutally honest. I have ""studied"" as much as possible before making an actual commitment. I feel more informed and confident thanks to this book."
2,Desperately Needed a Professional Editor,"I bought this book because the reviews were so glowing. The information may be valuable, however, the prose is so dense, redundant and sprinkled with new-age philosophy/silliness that I find it hard to slog through. In fact, her style is so ""California"" it verges on satire, like something a character from the Steve Martin/Sarah Jessica Parker ""L.A. Story"" would have written.There is some good information in this book and I wish this book had been accepted by a respected publisher. A professional editing job would have been able to cast out the chaff from the wheat and readers would have been spared all the distracting and self-indulgent flourishes (is it important to know how much she likes keeping a *spiral* journal using *rolling ball writer* pens?)."
2,"Covers all aspects of FACELIFTS, not much else though","Great book for those contemplating a facelift, but this book doesn't really cover any other operations. I could have done without the ""choice"" words in it also!!"
1,This item was rated as a 1--no battery pack,"My Canon G3, used a similar device, would renew the ION batteries. I am disappointed in Canon for putting out a camera that could only use batteries. Why have they fallen so far, that they cannot keep up the high standards that were once known to Canon buyers. This is very poor quality."
5,Good watch,"So far, so good for this watch. The band is more structured than expected, but fits nicely on the wrist. Also, the watch face is a good size - not too big, not too small."
5,Worth the wait!,"I got this at a steal of a price. Became backordered, and arrived after several months :-X ... definately was worth the wait. Beautiful watch, fits my small wrist perfectly. I get compliments on it all the time. Looks, feels, and wears like a $600 watch."
3,great episode,"galileo seven is one of my favorites. unfortunately, in scene with fog, the picture quality was patchy--don't know if that how it was filmed or the dvd had a problem. otherwise--great. also did not care for the thin jewel case--every other star trek dvd i own has a standard sized jewel case."
3,An interesting read,"Maybe I would have given this book an extra star if I hadn't read it during a time when I was receiving plenty of my own rejections! Anyone else suffer from occasional bouts of literary pica? Back to the book, I found her characters were fabulously three dimensional, and the story itself, though not earth shattering, was interesting to say the least. The subtext of Jews versus Jews in Hollywood, was very thought provoking. It wouldn't make it with me to that mythical desert island, but I am glad I read it."
2,Wretched!,"I hate when a promising book takes a nosedive. The problem here is the narrator - she's a real whiner, and after 30 pages I couldn't what happens because you know she's just going to find a way to complain or roll around in her ultra-sensitivity. It seems to be a cathartic first novel by (surprise) a former screenwriter. A better read is The Deal by Peter Lefcourt."
5,Bravo!,"I would like to add my voice to those who reviewed and praised this book. Dori Carter knows whereof she speaks, and her keen eye for observation along with her talent for finding just the right combination of incisive commentary and trenchant humor are unparalleled. I found it hard to believe that this is, indeed, a first novel. The subject could have provided just one more dreary harrangue about the perils of the film industry and the miserable people who work in it, but this mature and thoughtful work kept me entertained, made me think and inspired my admiration for an author who is clearly not afraid to tell it like it is. I can't wait for her next book."
1,Don't waste your time or your money! It's just dreadful.,"The rave ratings on this book enticed me. However, I found this sad little volume about the dreariest books I've ever read about so called Hollywood Insiders.The additudes and values expressed in this book amazed me in that I had no idea that people could be so base, superficial and vulgar. Status seeking, clawing for power that is just always out of reach, surely there must be more to life than the drivel provided by this author.BTW: She whines too much, and doesn't have a winning attitude.The book totally lacks charm, and even the ""wit"" was so self-depricating and fillled with obvious self-hatred that I found the whole thing embarassing and pathetic.A very, very sad look into what makes Hollywood tick."
2,Will Readers Care Beyond Los Angeles?,"Hollywood insiders have always been smitten with movies and television shows about the downright mean business they work in. So it would be no surprise to me if many of those same people found this book a delightfully literary black comedy. Dori carter writes well, with the voice of her narrator, Frankie Jordan almost feeling like someone Sue Grafton or Susan Isaacs would have created.Unfortunately she's not someone I ever rooted for in the book. In fact I don't think there were any people in this book I even liked let alone rooted for.-Well, maybe her Grandmother who is not integral to the plot but at least had a heart. Overall the book left me confused;Was it a cautionary tale of the pitfalls in Hollywood or a meditation on how Jews perceive themselves versus the idealized world of the WASP they're perpetuating in the media? Maybe both, or neither one. Ultimately the only thing I learned was that Hollywood is full of hateful, unhappy people."
2,Not too bad,"I don't like using the word mediocre, but that is pretty much what the book is. An evil, powerful man is responsible for the death of the lead characters husband and child, and she sets out to frame him and get revenge. How she gets close to him is unrealistic, but this is fiction. There is also an ex-CIA agent working for a competitive company also attempting to get some info on the bad guy. They wind out working together to bring him down. But the plot falls short in action, and the demise of the bad guy is too abrupt and ""distant"", even though that was the actual point of all the predicaments the lead characters engaged in. The ending does stop short, leaving too much left undone, but don't write off this author yet. I think she has shown promise of better works to come."
2,Unbelievable plot,"Yes, a plot that it's difficult to believe. While truth can be stranger than fiction, the many not-credible happenstances that this author would have us believe significantly detract from the book.On top of that, there's only one character who has more than one dimension to their personality. Everyone else, from the protagonist on down, is either all-good or all bad -- if you count the heroine's mixing in of revenge with justice as ""good."""
1,Beret,"The material is of poor quality, is like a pressed felt, not wool. The sizes ( one fits all) are small , does not fit all. I did not care for this item."
1,LOUSY Delivery Service,"Amerimark, the company behind this beret, is not truthful of their delivery promise. I placed my order a good month back and it has yet to arrive - despite the 10 day waiting time. Despite calls to comment on this, customer service isn't very helpful, and any emails to them only bounces back. Not exactly a great first start to my first purchase with them!"
3,Not a directors beret,"This is a nice wool beret but it is no different than a wool beret that is readily available on the street. It is not as advertised, ""a directors beret"". It is flat and not molded into a hat shape as I was expecting."
5,Very Nice Beret,"This beret is stylish, and of good quality. It's a very good buy for the price. Also, it's great for keeping your head warm on cold days."
2,Elbow pads fell apart,My physician prescribed me to wear elbow pad to my left hand. I bought it on Amazon.comAfter 3 months it fell apart due to low quality and weak kneets the used to craft the pad.
4,Great idea,"The product is a well thought idea...initially, I thought this is quite a weird little gimmick, but upon actual use, it makes a lot of sense! It definitely keeps track of which glass belongs to whom...keeping duplicate wine glasses and mistakes down to a minimum."
4,Lamp is fine,"The lamp itself it quite nice and well priced. However, it took my several months to find out what type of lightbulb to use (and customer service was no help). I finally found that the correct type of lightbulb needed is a ""Tubular bulb."" Now it works great!"
4,Dyslexia and the Stars,"A very interesting story of British actress Susan Hampshire's early life and beginnings in the theater, emphasizing her struggles with dyslexia. Excellent for fans of Susan Hampshire and for those interested in dyslexia."
3,"Soft hair, ok for skin","Many people have told me that this oil can be used to grow hair so I bought it and I haven't seen any of that. However it does leave my hair extremely soft with no buildup. I have 4b African American hair, the roughest of rough, and when I hot comb my hair the oil adds an even softer touch to it. As for skin I suppose it would be best to add after baths. I use this because my hands get so dry that the skin breaks and cracks and bleeds. It does not get rid of the problem and only mildly helps it feel/get better. I believe it would be best if I mixed this with something else. Yes the smell is slightly overpowering. You can mix it with essential oils if you'd like. It's not that bad but I can see where it would be a problem. Overall it does get your hair soft and if you have mild to slightly dry skin it'd work great. It only worked ok on my extremely dry skin."
4,This stuff is great,"I am a woman with wavy, yet frizzy and dry hair, due to straightening my hair, shampooing it too much, dying it, and living in such a dry state. I was looking for a chemical free remedy for my icky hair. This stuff is great compared to products with mineral/petroleum oil in them and is so lightweight. My hair has never been so alive! I totally recommend this to everyone of every hair type."
3,Merp.,This makes my hair softer and more manageable after I straighten it. It's not exactly beautiful and flowing afterwards but it definitely gets me through the day. The bad thing about it is that it smells just like baby oil. I don't necessarily hate the smell but I wish the smell were more faint..or if there wasn't any smell at all.As for using it on your body.. I have yet to try it that way. :P
3,ohkay oil,the oils that are in it are wonderful. But the smell is wayyyyyy over powering. reminds me of the smell of baby oil. If you dont mind using a oil with a very strong smell you should give this oil a whirl.
4,Rand McNally Atlas,"This is a handy book to have. I bought it as a replacement. I accidentally wet my friend's one, hence I wanted to replace it, thus I gave this one to my friend. I am pleased to have found it and to have made the purchase."
4,"Clean, clear, and feeling healthy","My experience with this face wash is excellent. It has a pleasant mild sent that reminds me of rosemary, but possibly mint. I use it daily and I'd say my skin would thank me for it. My only desire would be to have something of a moisturizer built into it for my lazy self. Other than that it's brilliant."
1,Another toe(s) hits the ground,"The authors main objection to Castaneda's works is that they somehow have something to do with Native Americans. They don't. Early on, Don Juan corrected Carlos' assumption. The Don Juan paradigm, was formed by mostly non-native practitioners, receiving their training orally, in a way similar to the shamanic tradition, but with no connection. Don Juan is not shamanic or religious--he is mystical--having to do with knowing the way the physical universe is put together, and thereby gaining mastery over it, and finally able to leave it ""shoes, hat, and all"". Don Juan is not shamanic, mythic, or Native American, and states so many times. The author's either are unable to assimilate Castaneda, or they have a hidden agenda--such as making a name for themselves by riding on the coat tails of the successes of the philosopher Carlos Castaneda."
1,armchair generals,"SCARE- BETTER STAY ASLEEP, PUPPY.

WE WILL FIGHT"
2,This is a fictional edition!,"I'm a bit embarrassed. The book offered here has exactly the same subtitle as Jay Courtney Fikes' book titled ""Carlos Castaneda: Academic Opportunism and the Psychedelic Sixties"" (It's set out on the Amazon pageCarlos Castaneda: Academic Opportunism and the Psychedelic Sixties. Besides, the book IBSNs listed here are exactly the same as that of Fike's book! How this could be? As far as I know, Margaret Ranyan's book ""A Magical Journey With Carlos Castaneda"" has been published at least twice (in 1996 by Millenia Press and in 2001 by iUniverse) but in either case the book hasn't had the subtitle ""Academic Opportunism and the Psychedelic Sixties"". I just wonder, has anybody ever seen the book offered here? Is this some ""special"" Ranyan's book edition I've never heard before or maybe this is just a mere mistake? Too bad that this book is ""unavailable"" now. Several days ago the seller HPB-072 offered it for about $50. Wow! The book must be a real rarity!"
1,TOOTHLESS SPOOF,"I don't know what movie the other reviewers saw, but it can't be the same one? There are so many editing bloops that it reminds me of Ray Harryhausen's stop motion animation.Bruce Glover (who played one of the gay killers in DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER) tries to inject Leslie Nielsen like humor in his inept Dr. Van Helsing, but it just isn't funny. It's all bee done before and much better.Denny Sachen as the studly Stephen has the emotional range of a rutabaga; Kerry Dustin as Carla radiates a quiet sensuality but given the role she plays, it is useless. The rest of the cast, who also have a lot of no talent, merely add bodies. Some of the effects are okay, but again been there done that much better. While the photography is beautiful and captures the atmosphere of Moravia and what-not, this movie is really bad. The three actors who play Dracula have got to be three of the most repulsive looking things I've seen on screen.Good idea, horrible execution."
2,One of the best bad movies ever!,"This is an awfull movie!! So much fun to watch, although you'll be shaking your head and yelling ""What????""."
1,Watch Hard Dracula,"I love bad movies but this movie wasn't good bad, it was bad bad. It started off great with the casket flying around with the Flight of the Valkeries playing in the background. I thought it would be nothing but pure awesome from that moment on but oh how wrong I was.It was like the actors were all porn stars except for Homeless Van Helsing. I swear I've seen that toothless bastard holding a ""eyem a homeless vetrenarian"" sign on the corner. He was creepy, missing teeth, couldn't act, and yet was the saving grace of the film. Making fun of him was the highlight of the movie. Oh, and Meatloaf Dracula wasn't too shabby either.I kept trying to click the blank space to the left of the first star for the rating but to no avail. If you love bad movies and just don't care about your sanity anymore, then get Die Hard Dracula, watch it with a bunch of people and a few mugs of beer."
4,Really good,"This is very good, speaking as someone who hasn't followed every Cracker album. Somewhat like Cracker, but maybe a bit more bluesy, and somehow more approachable. I wanted to listen to the album a second time right away. Some songs are just plain catchy country-inspired ditties, which aren't ratcheted up like they might be on a cracker album. In fact, I just bought a bunch of the more recent ""4-star"" Rolling Stone reviewed albums, and I'm listening to this album much more than those, it's at least equal in quality."
5,What I expected ordering from Amazon,The book was in wonderful shape for a used book. This is what I have come to expect order through Amazon. I have recommeded other to do the same.
2,Disapointing,"When I first saw this book in the library, I was overjoyed because I love the previous novels that ""October Song"" is based on. Yet, as I started reading the novel, much to my disapointment, I found that each story was not very complete. The story of Katie and Dan, for example, ended when the plot was finally developing.I have read many of Beverly Lewis's books and each has its own originality in its atempt to inform readers about Jesus' message and the Amish people. Yet, this was the first book that didn't accomplish either goal.I am very disapointed to say that ""October Song"" had a very simple, predictable, and boring plot. I would only recommend this novel to anyone who has read Beverly Lewis's previous stories and would like to learn what happens next with the hope that a real sequel would soon be written and published."
3,disappointing for Lewis,"Ugh. The concept of switching between characters doesn't work. I guess i would recommend reading The Post Card/Crossroad set and The Redemption of Sarah Cain beforehand. Otherwise, ignore this book."
3,Left a lot dangling,"I had expected this book to tie up loose ends. However, it did anything but. It was a peak into the daily lives of some of the characters from previous books, but left a lot of loose ends dangling. I do wonder how amused my Georgia Peach grandmother would be over anyone thinking her maiden name of Bradley was a ""modern name."" She was born in 1897 and many of her ancestors came to the U.S. in the 1600s."
1,Product was returned,"This book was returned along with two others. The books were sent to Shana Cottle, and I was told they were returned. I see no indication of a credit on my credit card."
1,I NEVER RECEIVED MY BOOK,I PAID FOR THIS BOOK AND HAVE YET TO RECEIVE IT. THIS WAS OVER A MONTH AGO. HOW DO I GET MY MONEY BACK? AND WHY SHOULD I NOW TRUST YOUR WEBSITE?
4,Great Book,This book was great but you need to read her other adult fiction books first. If you read this book first you ruin the plots to the others. I love her style and I now love the Amish. I actually went to Lancaster last summer after reading her books. It was great. I hope she continues writing. I own almost all her books.
2,Booorrring!,"This book was BORING with a capital-""B""! I ended up flying through the last half, just skimming the ""high points"", of which there weren't manyOf some interest if you have read the books this book is based on; if not, do NOT bother!"
4,The best Tristan?,"Could be. Melchior, Flagstadt and Beecham - that says it all. I didn't think I'd like Becham's Wagner but I do. This is the best transfer of this great performance I have heard. It has acceptable mono sound (one star demerit).Don't hesitate. Highly recommended! (See my comments under Reiner's version on Naxos)"
2,"Strange fit, perma-wedgie","Okay, I am pretty easy when it comes to underwear. Low riding and non-binding. That's all I ask for. The crotch on these is so narrow and when you pull them up they are not low rider but they give you a wedgie. I don't think that they are too big, they are definitely not too small. When I am stuck wearing these, I end up having to wear them like saggy pants urban wear. Oh well. They get two stars because they are physically nicely made, just poorly designed. No wonder they are only $7+ on Amazon when the price tag says $23. Live and learn."
2,Ho Hum wake me up when it's time to go.......,"Looks like I'm bucking the rating trend. Okay, I grew up listening to Dylan (yeah, old guy here). Sure, it's a decent CD, but, there's no pizzazz, no punch. There's sumpthin' missing. I don't expect the outpour of a Kiss concert but Dylan seems to almost be performing for hisself. For the Dylan novice, I suggest Nashville Skyline, perhaps. Or, maybe a greatest hits CD. Save this one if you find yourself enamored with Dylan and absolutely have to have every possible version of his songs. By the way, I was hoping the final cut; Like a Rolling Stone, would be a powerhouse; bringing down the walls of the hall. Nope. Alas..."
3,a little old (this is the rock -not classical- genre),"the music of Dylan, BOB is rather dated and booring when set side by side with our latest pop sensations such as Puff Daddy. But if you are living in the past or reminiscent of lost youth, then by all means listen to BOB."
1,"The Bootleg Series, Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live, 1966: The ""Royal Albert Hall Concert""","This was BAD....in fact, SO bad that I returned it! I didn't even want to give it one star, but there was no ""-0"" to choose from. I had also ordered ""The Bootleg Series, Vols. 1-3 : Rare And Unreleased, 1961-1991"", but this one was SO BAD, I didn't even bother to open and listen to the other one. Just put them both back in the box and returned them!"
5,Unfortunately wrong venue,"Despite being Dylan fans , with the exception of one reviewer therest of you are misguided as to the venue, It was indeed the Free Trade Hall in Manchester..I should know ..I was there. I was studying for my Degree in Manchester and it was my final year in 1966.We booked tickets but the place was jam packed...to our good fortune..my friend and I ended up sitting on the stage right behind the Man himself and his band the Hawks.It has become know as the Judas concert..during the electric second half a member of the audience shouts out ""Judas""..to which Bob replies ""I don't believe you, you're a liar"" and he can then be heard saying to the band "" play F***ing loud"".For those interested about this defining moment in Dylans career there is a book about the whole show and its build up called ""Like the night.."" by C.P Lee (ISBN 1 900924 07 2)take look at the photos and you will see me and my mate peeping from out of the shadows behind the band on the stage."
5,"I loved the album--favorite song is ""Tambourine Man.""","Although I bought the album for the much-praised ""Play ****loud"" electric set, I find the acoustic first set more and more wonderful with subsequent listenings. Not only does Mr. Dylan refrain completely from playing anything resembling traditional ""folk"" music (and who better to know trad than the Brits?), but the entirety of this set is his own truly revolutionary lyrical outpourings. The absolute high point, however, is ""Mr. Tambourine Man."" For those who believe that Bob Dylan is no worse than the second-best harmonica player in the world, this cut is like heaven...the solos mirror the mood and feel of the lyrics perfectly. Please, someone, point out a better Dylan harp solo....I'd love to hear it. Until then, this will do quite nicely!!!"
1,Bobby on Methadrine,This is actually a five star review but with all the syncophants I thought it better to hide it down here.Hearing this if you remember Bobby was taking Benzadrine regularly--- you can make allowances for his high state of consciousness. His unabashedly naming of those sinners responsible for this mess we are all in in our consciuos minds. Our failure to try to extricate ourselves...Hey. I am still here. I get it. If you are alive and tired of looking for a fellow traveler in our post- consciousness post communist world---I am like totally HERE.I am looking for friends like YOU. My email is rleeharvey@hotmail.com.Stop being the only one left on the planet. I GET this album.Hello. Heck yeah. We are still HERE...
5,The BEST Live Album EVER!!!,"I thought that the ""press"" was over-doing it a bit by stating that this is the greatest live in-concert recording, but I swear to you it really is true! I Urge you to get Live 1966. Don't think twice, it's alright. Whether you like Nirvana, Beatles, George & Tammy, Prince, P.J. Harvey, or Rev. James Cleveland, etc.....This is a MASTERPIECE!!! The packaging for Live 1966 is 5 stars as well. Beautiful color & bw pics, and great liner notes from Tony Glover as well. You won't need the remote for this one, put it on & let the Whole thing play. One of the top 5 albums I've ever heard in my life!"
5,Best of 1998?! No! The Best Ever!!!,"I can't describe the way I felt when I first heard the second disc. There are not enough words to express such a feeling. This is so fantastic, so amazing, so electrifying, so... Wow! Bob Dylan makes me proud. :-) No artist has ever reached anywhere near this level. Bob Dylan had marched the Rock n' Roll to higher levels. He is the most important artist of this century. Anyone who never heard this recording must do it NOW!"
5,Regarding this CD: I have but one regret,"That one regret is I wasn't in the Free Trade Hall in Manchester that night. Of course, I wasn't born, so I have an excuse. I would have loved to have given the ""Judas"" heckler a piece of my mind. But enough about that incident. Like I said, I'm too young to have been there, but at least I have this disc. I usually avoid buying ""live"" recordings because I learned from my mom's old Beach Boys albums that recordings of concerts sometimes feature more screaming than actual music. Not so with ""Bob Dylan Live 1966,"" it's a quality recording, and the audience and setting compliments rather than obscures the music one usually buys records for in the first place. The acoustic songs on the first disc are all songs I've heard before, but Dylan tweaked 'em just enough to make them sound fresh. I especially like this version of ""Mr. Tambourine Man."" The then-controversial electric set on the second disc is raw and loud, like rock 'n' roll should be."
5,Bob at his best,"There's no need for me to go into detail, given the number of other reviews on this. But this is just Bob Dylan at his absolute best. I'm listening to the album for the zillionth time right now. The acoustic side is great--the best from Bob's early years. Then the electric side just knocks your socks off. There is so much energy in Dylan's singing, and The Band is in rare form. The electic guitar solos are amazing. Each song is better than the last, and every track carries extra energy that you don't hear in the studio versions."
5,Kept me on my toes always wanting to find out what is next.,It was a really good book. I would recommend it to anyone
4,Good but...,"It's a bit longer than it needs to be. There are pages and pages of description...overly descriptive in my opinion. Sometimes that type of thing is needed, but sometimes it can be omitted without taking away from the story which is the case here. If you have some patience to get through the tedious parts, you will find a really good story at the heart of it. I did enjoy reading it, but it could have been better."
5,THE OATH,"I was never fond of reading, but upon discovering Frank Peretti's books, at age 50, I began a new path. THE OATH is by far Mr. Peretti's greatest work. I am a care giver for my mother and mother-in-law and found myself hiding behind furniture on the floor, not being able to put the book down, while still within earshot of their shenanigans. Thank you Mr. Peretti for an exciting vacation from life!"
2,"A disappointing follow up to ""Prophet""","After having read the Darkness series (The premise of which Mr. Peretti attributes divine intervention) and Prophet, I found Oath left me a bit flat. A master storyteller, Mr. Pereti once again is able to draw his readers into the mind, spirit and emotions of his characters. The spiritual overtones seem to be a bit lacking in this work however. That, I believe, contributes to stunted character growth and an unsatisfying conclusion. Had Mr. Peretti strengthened the character's spiritual growth in an order of magnitude approaching Prophet, the book may have been more satisfying. Had he dropped the spiritual overtones, this may have been a nice monster story."
5,INTENSE,"I HAD JUST THOUGHT I HAD READ SOME GOOD BOOKS BY FRANK PERETTI BUT EACH TIME I READ THE NEXT ONE IT BECOMES MY FAVORITE!!!THEY ARE ALL SO CAPTIVATING YOU REALLY FEEL LIKE YOU ARE IN THE STORY! HE IS A FANTASTIC WRITER, AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HIS NEXT MASTERPIECE!!!"
5,Scary,"Frank Peretti can make you believe the impossible, or is it? He will also scare you Christian if you aren't already. He can make you cry and fear to turn the next page, but he never make you think he, [the author] has lost is marbles as some authors do!"
5,great book,"I found the story to be a bit predictable at times, however it was really well written, and I enjoyed it very much."
3,exciting,"This book was exciting, but I felt that it lacked character development. I liked the concept, and it kept me interested, but it was a little predictable."
4,Mixed feelings,The book I am reading is very interesting at the beginning but then again very confusing I don't know if it is because of me or just it really is confusing.At the beginning of the book it starts out with somone running like crazy from somthing but it does not say what so you are very confused for the first chapter until you get to the second chapter which is lableded The Bear. I like this book though accept the fact I think this book is way to long for the topic. There is talk about Cliff a guy that was killed while camping at the beginning the sheriff thinks it's a bear but there is talk that it something. At the beginning I thought that it was a bear but then I started to have mixed feelings about this thing that killed cliff I am beginning to think that it is something else. Also I think that the author should have explained a little more at the beginning bu then again I think he did a googd job because I want to read more.
3,The Oath,"The Oath, by Frank Peretti, portrays spiritually in the form of a dragon and a town full of sinful people. The novel begins with a great deal of excitement from the first sentence. It grabs hold of your interest almost immediatley. However, as the book unfolds most of the excitement is lost when the reader uncovers that the mysterious creature hiding among the woods of Hyde River is none other than a color changing dragon. As the novel continued, my interest seemed to lessen. I felt like it was a ""hokey"" portrayal of the effect of sin in our conscience. Overall, the book seemed to have a good message, however, I felt like the plot of the story was too drawn out and that it could be summed up better in less than 550 pages! With that in mind, I probably would not recommend this book to my peers because of the way your interest lessens as the novel progresses."
3,What's to keep secret?,"This book had good descriptions and agonizing cliffhangers that wrenched my gut and left me breathless. The plot is far fetched but when dealing with the paranormal, isn't it all far-fetched? Otherwise, duh, it wouldn't be PARAnormal, it would just be normal. Great Stuff and a great read!"
5,Great thriller,"I knew what was going to happen eventually, no doubt about it. I'll blame partly on the fact it's a christian book so obviously the MC will be converted, and partly on the fact I sneaked a glance at the epilogue. My fault. I did the same to the bridge to terebinthia, and the owners want to kill me for doing so. ;)It's a dark book, no doubt. With a bit of the witch hunt days and rogue animals, darkness, and marks mixed in, it's a very interesting thriller indeed."
4,"Not His Best, But Good","The Oath is a great work, but compared to The Visitation or Piercing The Darkness it doesn't hold up. Some of the battle scenes between the main character and the creature seem to drag on. The dialogue makes this book good. I think the book had about 75 to 100 pages too many."
3,dark,"This was dark for a Christian book, but I liked it. About time our writers stepped it up a little. Way to go Frank."
3,it was okay,"My girlfriend recommended this book to be so I read it on faith that it was going to be good. I know from the get go it was by a Christian author so there would be some underling Christian ideas to the plot point. So it started off okay I was enjoying the Scooby doo mystery going on and the entire back story but at the end it fell short by the ending. In fact the only real reason I even finished the book was because I told my girlfriend I would. if not I would have stopped half way and just found another book to waste my time with, the story was straight ford I guess most of what happened and the underlining Christian ideas where not even good to keep the story going. This book in my opinion fell short and is only worth 3 stars only because of the beginning if that not I would have given it 1. If you like Frank Peretti stories I try another book."
1,"to read the Oath, or not read the Oath - Not read","I tried reading this book because of the author's reputation for writing good Christian thrillers, and found it totally boring! The story centers around the main character investigating the killing of his brother by a bear, in a small rural town. The author builds some tension, but after reading it for fifty some odd pages, and nothing else happens, you lose interest, fast. I just couldn't get into it, but will try his other books(This Present Darkness, and Piercing the Darkness) hopefully they are better.Suggestion for Christians who like a book that moves; try Cain, by James Byron Huggins, same basic plot, but it moves a lot faster! Peretti should try reading this book to see how to write a Christian thriller.Another Good Christian (End Times) thriller is Blood Moon by Hal Lindsay."
1,"Don't bother, this book is a total waste of time.","Peretti should have spent his time working at a soup kitchen rather than writing this book. He attempts to coorilate the damage of sin in ones life to that of a powerful dragon. He fails. He gets too graphic in the ""sin"" a man and women commit with each other. He fails to make a clear conection between sin and the dragon. His other books are nothing like this one. If you liked This Present Darkness and Peircing the Darkness you should PASS on this one. On the other hand if all you like are satanic stories of the likes of Stephen King, you may enjoy this one. Do NOT let children read this book."
1,Not too original,"I found The Oath to be too long. It was very difficult to finish the story. I didn't find the story spiritually up-lifting, unlike other Christian books. On the horror genre side, the story wasn't too original.I am a fan of horror stories and I heard The Oath was very good. Unfortunately the story didn't raise any hair on the back of my neck."
2,Half of the details would have sufficed,"There were too many intricate details in this 550 page book that didn't really add to the story --unlike his previous books, This Present Darkness and Piercing the Darkness. This book had a very different outcome and I had to really stretch to see the spiritual application. I love his writings but this book just didn't click with me like the rest."
2,Not up to the level of Testament,"After Testament, I wanted to read more titles by Peretti. For Christian readers, there is scant positive spiritual dimension to the characters and I found the book to be slow-paced."
3,Lacks gospel presentation...,"The plot of the book is intriguing, but the point of the book, to share the light of Christ with others, never really makes it. While the characters are well developed, and the story line gripping, the focus of the book is more on the people and their sin, rather than the grace of God to defeat the monster their sin causes them to become. More light next time, less darkness."
3,disappointing,"The Oath was a big disappointment compared to Peretti's early works. As I was reading this book I got the feeling that the author had made a big success in the ""Darkness"" books and then got lazy. The characters just fall short of being real heroes or villians, the action too forced. It isn't that this book isn't interesting, nor did I fail to finish reading it, I was just expecting much more. On the plus side, I got my son (13 at the time) to read it and he loved it (it's hard to even get him to read non school stuff so this was a blessing indeed). I think for what it is, it's ok, but if you're expecting something on par with what Peretti did ten years early, sorry."
4,Very mystical for a Christian novel.,"I think that I enjoyed This Present Darkness more. The Oath delt more with dragons and mystical beings rather than the reality of demons and angels. The message of the book was true though and I think that this was put across quite clearly. I really feel that the black spot over the heart made sense, especially for a non-christian reader. I enjoy Peretti's books and I hope that he keeps writing as well as he has been; after all, we can't let the world go on thiunking that Christians have no imagination can we?"
3,"Decent read, but not as good as the hype","This was my first Peretti book -- and it was purchased based on the reviews I found here on Amazon.com. The story was interesting and the author does a good job of getting the message across about how having faith and God in your life can conquer all. However, I was not as impressed as my fellow readers. I couldn't ""see"" the action as I listened to the book (I have the audiobook version), so I didn't get as ""involved"" with the characters as I typically do when reading (or listening to) a good book. I did however, appreciate the message. That was refreshing and does make one think -- which it should."
4,I wish they would make it a movie!,"Like a previous reviewer, I also bought this book due to the promising cover and name. I wasn't disappointed!! The book was written in such a way as to keep your curiosity peaked at all times. Frank Peretti is a very gifted writer, his writing has just enough detail to bring you into the story and make you feel as if you're really there without boring you. This book was anything but boring! I guess if you are a horror movie buff and have seen every horror movie made, this book may not seem too exciting, but for me it was! In fact, when I go camping, I sometimes find myself looking to the trees for that,'out of place branch' or that 'blurry tree trunk' or maybe those 'haunting yellow eyes'. This book was a very good discription of sin and the effect it has on humanity. I've recommended this book to several people already and their reactions were very similar to mine! So naturally if you haven't read this book, I also recommend it to you!!"
3,The Darkness of Indifference,"I'm not sure how I feel about this book. It certainly kept my interest (I read it cover to cover in about a weeks time). However, I couldn't get past the thought that this book reminded me of a script for ""Predator"" that was rejected. The ""living sin"" was a nice concept, but was too much like the creature in Predator for me to consider it original. The conversion of the non-believing main character comes too late in the story and isn't very believeable. Mind you, I realize that everyone receives salvation differently. My experience will differ from thousands of others, however, from a general perspective this was not very realistic. It felt more like an after thought. All that being said though, I did enjoy it for the most part. It's a good, fast paced read."
5,Smart and Scary,"The Oath is a great book for the horror, thriller, mystery type reader like me. Even though this was written by a christian author, it read like a Stephen King novel. This book was written with great thought and imagination. After reading this book, it really made me think, and it scared me too. The ending really took my breath away. A lot of christian authors need to take lessons from mr.peretti. Read it! You will enjoy it."
4,Incredible,"The book is amazing. Frank Peretti is absolutely gifted with writing. The Gospel is presented in a minor fashion, but the book clearly emphasizes the penalty of sin. There is no escaping sin, and once it starts in your life it only grows and gets bigger and stronger, till it overwhelms you in the end, possibly destroying your life. That may sound like preaching to you, but this book clearly relays this message in a fashion that will even have a non-christian flipping the pages from beginning to end. It also tells you how to get out, but I don't want to spoil THE SUSPENSE, so read it yourself. If you you are the type of person that does not like to read in particular or thinks that christian science fiction is not going to be good... YOU REALLY NEED TO READ THIS BOOK!!"
5,An excellent storyline!,"This was the first Peretti book I have read.I was captivated by the intensity of the events, and I read until past midnight on several nights, because I couldn't put it down!This is definitely a thriller written from a christian perspective"
4,A book that truly captivated my interest.,"This novel was wonderfully written, and has captivated my interest like very few ever have. It was not only suspenseful, but intriguing. The writing was powerful, and brought the characters to life. The setting was spectacularly set, and the figurative expressions cleverly cloaked until the climaxing of the story. This book is a definite 'must read', and is a book that will fascinate and enthrall anyone who reads it.Veronica Copeland (vlc@flinet.com)"
3,Didn't Make the Grade,"After greatly enjoying two of Peretti's other books, ""This Present Darkness,"" and ""Piercing the Darkness,"" I was disappointed with ""The Oath."" The story was interesting and engaging, however the characters lacked depth and I had the feeling that I was reading the same things over and over again. The story was an allegory, however there was not a strong enough development of the meaning or purpose within. This resulted in an unwillingness to suspend disbelief. The story needs at least one strong hero and a greater emphasis on good winning out over evil. I can't really recommend this one."
2,A potentially good story that is poorly written.,"This tale of good versus evil cloaked in the guise of a mysterious evil hidden deep in the secrets of an old mining town reads like a Hardy boys/Nancy Drew book. While the basis for the story is good and the story line fairly well developed, the simplistic conventions of writing, weak dialogue and sketchily drawn characters do little to entice the reader's inner eye. This would be a good read for a high school class in that the dissection of blatant symbolism, simple characters and story development would all be easily used to teach the basics of novel writing."
2,The end drags on too long when the suspense is long gone.,"It took a long time for me to ""get in the book"" and I'm not sure that ever really happened. I kept waiting for a twist of some kind... which never came :(Peretti is an awesome author, but if you really want good christian reading, check out his ""This present darkness/Piercing the darkness"" novels instead. Prophet is great as well, though in a different style.I just was expecting something more exiting/interesting from Peretti than this book."
3,It was okay.,"This book was okay, but I like ""This Present Darkness"" and ""Piercing the Darkness"" and ""Prophet"" better. I wish they had those for the Kindle. If you are at amazon.com any time soon you should take a second to request those ones. Thanks."
4,Dragons are alive and well and living in Hyde Valley,"Although this book is very different to his 'darkness' books it is very entertaining. The mystery of the origin of the deaths in Hyde valley is kept hidden until the last minute. Readers should stick with it to the end to gain the jewel of 'enlightenment'. That part of any good story that makes you think about it time and again. This story makes you think about the things that motivate people and live in their hearts. Although for me, the ending was a bit too abrupt, maybe that is what Frank Peretti intended, to make you think and/or wonder. Still a very good read that I would recommend to anyone that likes a bit of horror."
5,Is this book by Stephen King?,"The first 300 pages of this book could have been written by Stephen King, master of horror novels. It's the first of Peretti's I've read, and I'm definitely going to read more. It was a page-turner from the very beginning. But then, just when evil starts to win, the saving power of Jesus Christ comes into play. King only hints at the existence of God in his stories of good vs. evil (e.g. The Stand, The Green Mile...). Peretti puts it right out front where you can't miss the message.My 18 y.o. daughter read the book (which itself is incredible), and recommended it to me. A great book!"
5,One of Peretti's best!,"This is one of Frank Peretti's best novel: full of mystery, thrils and horror. A brother of a nature photographer, killed by what the police say was an animal attack, comes to an old mining town to find he truth. He finds everyone even more cold and mysterious than the death of his brother. Soon he finds an older, deeper secret, a horror in the form of a beast which is tied to the citizens of the town. Awesome read."
4,A Dark Read...,"This book is not Mama's Christian fiction. It's not all Happy and Whoopty Doo. Thats why i like this book. The book tells about sin and how its like a beast, waiting to eat you(or at least thats how I interprated it)and how it becomes part of you. And soon you dont really care that you are sining. Sin becomes a normal thing to you. It shows that the only to break free from sin is Christ. The only reason this book got a 4-Star is that the beggining of the book moved kind of slow, but after that, its good."
2,too simplistic for belief,"This novel needs about three revisions. The real story concerns the people who live in the town. Their interactions and relationships have created evil. Evil is not an outside force (the dragon); it is the selfishness of the individuals who want glory or power or money for themselves. Only Levi, whom many consider unbalanced, holds respect for humanity in his heart. If the author had bothered to make his characters more three dimensional and if had the talent to depict their personalities and actions upon each other, this might be a good book. As it stands, it is simplistic and unconvincing."
4,ANOTHER KEEPER FOR THE COLLECTION,"THIS WAS MY SECOND PERETTI---""""MONSTER"""" WAS MY FIRST. I ONLY GAVE THIS A FOUR STAR--I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT FOUR & A HALF IF ALLOWED. OOONNNLLLYYY---BECAUSE """"MONSTER"""" WASTHAT GOOD. HISTORICLY---CHECK PERETTI'S BACKGROUND---YOU SHOULD EXPECT A HUGE DOSE OFRELIGION--AND--""""THE OATH"""" HAS MORE IN IT THAN """"MONSTER DID--BY A LONGSHOT. BBBUUUTTT--IT REALLY ISN'T THAT INTENSE TO BE ANNOYING---A FEW OF PERETTI'S OTHER NOVELS GET OVER-RELIGEOUS, TO A FAULT. THERE IS SSSOOO MUCH ACTION GOING ON IN THIS BOOK---HORSES, DRINKING,SHOOTINGS, MOUNTAINS, MINING, SPOUSAL CHEATING---AND---A DRAGON!!!!MY ONE LINER ON PERETTI----HE IS AN EVANGELICAL CHRISTION STEPHEN KING---GREAT, GREAT BOOK!!"
5,The Oath,"I had never read any Christian fantasy books before. The characters were fantastic. The Christian undertones shown through the entire book. Peretti did a wonderful job exploring good and evil. It really got me thinking. My teenager is getting the audio book for Christmas, instead of Harry Potter.If his new books (series in place of Harry Potter) are anythinglike this one, they will be fantastic. We don't have them available where I live yet. Thanks hope you enjoy this book."
5,sweet scope,"Right off the bat, Yeah, I`m a beginner but I have had in my lifetime 3 of the department store variety of telescopes that easily cost 150.00 or better and they will never be anything like this Orion Astroview. Hear this. I tracked a jumbo jet you could barely see with the naked eye except for the vapor trail with the slow motion control for 15 seconds and it was awesome. Saw it from almost a head on view and could see all the engines wings and tail wing with clarity I couldn`t believe. Joked with my brother that I could see the pilot picking his nose. ( Kidding of course ). This with a barlow lense. It sucks that I work nights and have to hope for clear weekends but let me tell you the price for this kind of viewing can`t be beat as far as I`m concerned. I`m going to take it to my brother`s this weekend and show him how to polar align the scope then watch his expression when he sees Saturn. I bet he`ll want one. I bet he`ll get one."
4,No complaints from my guests,"Easy set up. Held pressure for weeks without any noticeable softening of the mattress. Sturdy and stable frame. Mattress fabric is tough and durable. Bought for camping, but comfortable enough to put my guests on."
1,Not happy,"I bought the bed because my family was in town for my son's wedding. My eight year old niece slept on the cot; given her light weight, there was no problem there. The bed was difficult to set up; the bar that goes across the top was a challenge. I purchased the pump to inflate/deflate the mattress; however the mattress can't be deflated. I have tried everything I could think of to get the pump to deflate the mattress; I'm stumped and would appreciate any suggestions. I haven't used the bed since my family left; I had to stuff the half-inflated mattress into the closet (what a drag). I'm disappointed with both purchases."
4,Pretty Good Beds,"Things I liked:Pretty lightweight, easy to move. Didn't take up too much space. Very comfortable night's sleep, at least that's what my nephews told me. Pretty sturdy, held my weight(about 220lbs) without a problem. I did not sleep on it, however. Packed and unpacked easily, and they fit nicely in a closet when not in use. Will probably take them on vacation, to use for kids when in smaller hotel rooms. (I bought two of them)Things I did not like:Little difficult to get the end rails on. I was afraid I might bend or break them when forcing them on, but got them on without bending or breaking. Still a little concerned that after repeated assembly/disassembly, I might not be so lucky. Black end caps on rails, that cover the sharp aluminum edges, fell out easily, and marred the walls. The black plastic left marks on the walls that I could not easily get off. Great for kids, but should be a little wider for a full-sized adult."
4,: PLEASED :,"Purchased for 2006 hunting season. Set up was simple, suggest a electric or manual pump. Very sturdy constuction. Once i found the right inflateable mode slept very comfortable. For the price. Compatable to the much higher priced one's, U cant beat it, Sits high enough for underneath storage ,And long enough for a tall pearson, Only negitive it could be a little wider watch it when you turn in your sleep."
3,So comfortable but hard to put together,"I bought Coleman Trailhead SpaceSaver Air Bed (30"" x 80"") for my mom and she slept on it in such comfort. The only problem I had was putting it together. It is really hard to assemble the cot the first 3 or 4 times and after that it gets a bit better. You have to stretch the fabric a lot to get it ends in place."
5,Duntemann Informative and Entertaining,"This book is the greatest for the advanced and begining computer programmers. First, it starts with the basics of memory and disk manipulation also dealing with CPU facts and register manipulation. Then it gets into assembler in an entertaining way."
5,Behavior Assistance,Excellent book for teachers looking to solve problems for students with issues or to help isolate and curb behavior issues. The guide is easy to read and would be beneficial for educators and parents.
1,not what was expected,We were told this book was in good condition. It was far from that. If you think the cover picture is one of the old books you remember...thats also decieving. Not all kerr books are created equal. Very disapointed
5,Classic- well worth reading,"This book ties together many ideas from the fields of anthropology and architecture. Rapoport methodically builds an argument for his hypothesis that ""The different forms taken by dwellings are a complex phenomenon for which no single explanation will suffice."" He supports his arguments with hundreds of examples drawn from the literature, as in the style of a review article. I was struck by parallelism between Rapoport's evidence that houses can vary tremendously, even given similar environmental or cultural factors, and the old structural linguistics adage that languages can vary in innumerable ways. Some of Rapoport's terminology is now outdated (e.g. ""primitive societies,""), but these terms were standard at the time when the book was written so he shouldn't be singled out for using them. The ideas presented in the book are well worth studying and the book includes numerous reference citations for further investigation."
5,Ready for a longer haul,My wife received this moses basket as a gift at our baby shower and we couldn't be happier. The color is very neutral - perfect if you plan to use this basket for more than one child (like us!). It is very plush and well made (super sturdy) with ergo-friendly handles. We chose this particular basket because it came in an oversize length so our baby wouldn't outgrow it right away (takes up 3/4 of the space in our pack n'play when placed inside).
3,Not bad ...BUT...,"Well I finally changed my old plugs with these ones, got more power engine, better gas mileage BUT i notice my car starts vibrating as soon as I hit 60 mph. dont understand why but that is my only issue."
4,Fantastic Pulp!,"Aren't ebooks great? Here's a reprint of a Joe Hannibal novel that first came out in 2001. Joe is hired to prove an unpopular ladiesman wasn't responsible for killing a beloved member of a Wisconsin summer resort center. Along the way he falls for a female reporter and is hindered in his investigation by several persons not happy with his investigation.It starts out as a standard PI investigation but turns into a pulpy action fest involving throwing stars, half-naked babes with machine guns and white slavery. It may sounds a bit seventies but as always Wayne manages to write a solid hardboiled novel that is never ashamed to be a good piece of entertaining hardboiled pulp without feeling dated.Good reading if you dig like Mike Hammer or Matt Helm."
4,Dance Mom's,I am a dance mom and I have been looking for a cute t-shirt that comes in larger sizes! This is it! It washes well and wears well. It arrived before the competition I needed to wear it to! Good colors!
4,Really cute t-shirt!,"I originally ordered the basic t-shirt, but when it arrived, it was really big and pretty boxy. I called the customer service number on my invoice and the agent was really helpful! She explained the exchange process, helped me choose a replacement item and was nice, too! I returned the original large and exchanged it for the fitted t-shirt and LOVE IT! Turn around time for my exchange was also very good. Would definitely recommend."
4,Great True Book,"I really liked this book, and thought it was one of the best Civil War romances that I have ever read.This book depicted the conflicts as it probably had been at that time, and showed little bias toward one side or the other. It examined the human disillusions of a war that split a country into and the tragedy that was left. It showed a growth of human spirit and was not afraid to abandon a lost cause.I would have given this book a five stars, but the formatting in the Kindle was terrible. How did that happen? It was very annoying."
3,Innocent Deceptions,"This was an okay book, nothing spectacular. I would give it 3.5 stars if I could. I found it to be extremely boring at times and I can't put my finger on why, it just was.It was a good example of how devastating the Civil War could be and showed how loyalties could separate families. I understand it was based on a true story, but since I couldn't find anything else about it, I have no idea how accurate it is. For readers of Civil War romances, it would be great. I liked the fact it was a bit different than the typical story of this kind."
3,Pleasant Reading,"I enjoyed reading this book. Why only 3 stars? I would give it a 3.5 if that was allowed. The situation that the young woman finds herself in didn't seem all that realistic to me. According to the behavior of young women in that time period, I just couldn't bring myself to believe all the situations that she found herself and her responses. It may have been based upon an actual spy but I believe that the author embellished a bit too much. However, it was a pleasant read and I would still recommend it, especially for those that like Civil War stories."
1,Worst $2.99 I've ever spent,This is one of the worst books I have ever read. I can't even put it into words it is so bad.
4,Great shoes,"These sandals are awesome! I bought this exact style a few times before and I love them, they are very comfy and go with everything, a bit pricey but so worth it!"
4,Good Syrup,I bought this irish cream syrup for my hot milk I like to drink when it is cold. The syrup was good not to sweet but I thought it tasted more like coffee than irish cream.
2,What do you expect from a $20 piece of plastic,"Well, I evidentally expected this product to come with the mounting screw and perhaps a piece of paper to show the best location to mount this. Instead, all you get is a plastic truck bracket."
3,Dodge Dakota front license plate bracket,"In all fairness I should begin by saying that I'm not a fan of front license plates. Supposedly they aid law enforcement officials with reverse radar etc. but not all states see the need to spend twice as much, and the states with only rear license plates catch speeders just the same. They look bad on most vehicles, and terrible on some sports models. But enough from my soap box, you want to know about the bracket; The bracket works fine, but doesn't come with any hardware. I had to fashion a metal strip to fit behind the lower grill to accept the bolts and nuts. So I couldn't just open the box and attach it to the truck. But it was not difficult to figure out, just a bit inconvenient."
2,Not satisfactory.,"I was not very pleased with the bracket. Mounting screws should have been included for the price paid. I don't like the clips on the top of the bracket, would have been more pleased with predrilled holes for mounting plate to bracket. By using the pilot holes on the bumper of the Dakota, the bracket sticks out too far and is tilted upward. This bracket does not come close to being satisfactory. As far as delivery, delivery was fast, and I was pleased with that."
1,"misleading - this is a kit, not full assembled","I was very surprised to find this was a kit. Now that I look for a second time, kit does appear, but not at the top of the page, not in the product features, not in the product details, but finally in the manufacturer's description. My fault, but a very misleading ad."
4,You won't be dissapointed.,"Unfortunately for me, this scale is easy to use and very accurate. Now I have no excuse or no one to blame when the pounds increase instead of decrease and the BMI goes up and not down. Seriously, it is fantastic. I compared the results with the super expensive, high tech devices at my doctor's office and my health club and they all gave the same response. It's a great device at a very good price!"
3,"""I'm on Biggest Loser!""","I am seriously observing a food budget, and I weigh twice a week.This one is a sleek machine, and it looks like the 21st century. It has many bells and whistles that I haven't mastered. In fact, I had to call the company to even FIND the bells and whistles. I'm supposed to be able to register body fat and water or something, and I still haven't figured that out. I just use it to weigh, which is what a scale is for, right?The scale part is great. My complaint is that I have to stand perfectly still to get the numbers to stop moving--even to the point of holding your breath. That's why I feel like I'm on Biggest Loser--the numbers go up, they go down, they go up, etc, etc. About 2-3 seconds later, they will stop and flash twice to let you know you're through.I like it enough not to end it back, but I wish the manual came with better directions to let you find the extra buttons."
1,Not Accurate,"The scales are simply not an accurate measure of body fat. I know my body fat is at least 10% higher than the scales read. So, I returned them."
3,telling,some difficulties in figuring out to get to specific person- but really cool one you get tehre
4,"SHED THE NICKNAME ""LARDBUTT.""","The scale said I was 1.5 pounds lighter than my previous scale indicated, which had me at 1.5 pounds lighter than the scale before that. I guess a scale user will feel good if a new scale shows him lighter than he thought, but maybe some industry standards are in order. Otherwise, it's consistent with itself, which is the most important thing. It's very attractive - a work of art even - and was much-appreciated by my somewhat overweight brother, who is trying to shake the nickname ""lardbutt."""
4,Escali High-Capacity Bathroom Scale,"The scale is accurate, and definitely capable of bearing a lot of weight. The monitors are a little sensitive, so be careful whenever you have to move it...Don't jar it. It shouldn't be used in humid/moist areas (you might want to move it away from a shower that is in use). This scale is very fashion forward, and worth what I paid for it."
4,So Far - So Good!!!,"I have not learned yet, to work all the features. However, I find it to be very accurate to measure your weight. I am very happy that I made this purchase."
5,Great scale at a great price,"We bought this scale based on other reviews and the price relative to others on the market. We've been using it for a few weeks now and love it. It's very stylish, and super easy to use. To activate the personalized weights (including body fat % and water %), you just step on the scale and hold for a second while it cycles through each person (1, 2, 3...). If you just want weight, you step on the scale to activate, step off for a second as it sets to zero, and you're ready to go. We like that it registers down to 0.2 lbs - precise enough for us to use to weigh our small dog and infant. We tested accuracy when we first bought it and it returned consistent weights for myself and my husband three times each."
5,Upto 440lbs - Tracker,"this scale is great because it has a higher capacity then most, tried to use it without firt reading the instructions, and found that we needed to use the instructions, but work great after we used as directed. There are quite a few that are around the 300+ limit but this is only one that looks nice, nice materials and goes up to 440lbs and has some other fancy features like allowing each individual to track their weight. Very nice."
3,"Until it broke, it was the best scale I've ever owned","This is a great scale, and is very accurate. It has a wonderful style. In many ways the Escali High-Capacity Bathroom Scale is a work of art.After 6 months of ownership, the batteries died. 2 new batteries were immediately purchased, and we were running again. No big deal. Until 3 days later, when once again new batteries were needed. The 3rd set of batteries also lasted only 3 days.My problem with the scale is it now eats about 2 $3.00 batteries every 3 days. I don't know if my scale just broke, or if others have had this problem. If it worked without eating batteries, it would have a 5 star rating from me.At this time, a new scale is necessary. It won't be a Escali High-Capacity Bathroom Scale. Burn me once, shame on me ..."
3,Worked fine for 14 months ...,"The scale worked fine for 14 months then suddenly broke. Now, of course I'm hefty, but I lost 75 pounds during that time so I'm well within the stated range it should be able to handle. I don't know if it was a cumulative strain on the parts which led to the failure, or what. Proceed with caution."
5,Good product to this point,"So far, this scale has been great, and looks great. I'm really happy with my purchase. Being a big boy, I needed something that would weigh in more than a normal scale, and I found it here.#1, it weighs at higher weights, and #2 it looks great.Over two years later, and this baby is still going strong."
3,Escali high capacity bathroom scale,The scale works fine for accurate weight but only works occasionally for the body fat and water %. Since I bought it for the high weight limit this is not a big issue for me.
1,This Scale is On Crack,"Seriously?!This scale is completely useless.My fiance bought this scale because she wanted to be able to check her body fat, which is fine and dandy. The only problem is the reading varies by 10-15 pounds a day. Hey man, I don't vary that much in a freaking day. I'm not eating entire sides of beef. Crikey, what gives with this thing? Now, granted, there is variance with meals and evacuation, but not THAT much.Yes, I'm a big boy at 6'1"" and 340 (according to a real reading at the doctor's office) but despite the fact that this thing has the capacity to handle even the biggest buffet experts/heavy hitters, it's pretty much useless for getting an accurate weight reading.Skip this and buy the Bigfoot Scale."
2,Not very good,"First of all, you can hardly read the weight because the number changes so fast. It's like a blur. All you can do is watch them change and try to come up with some kind of average. Also, it's a PITA to use - the ""interface"" - where the buttons are - are hard to find and hard to reach and hard to use. The manual is terrible. I never had any idea what mode it was in or how to change it. Confusing as hell. And most of all, if you're a fat person like me (and why else would you buy a high capacity scale?) the design is TERRIBLE because you have to lean forward to read the numbers, which throws the whole weight off. If you're like me and can't see your toes without leaning forward (which is why I bought the scale!), definitely skip this one."
1,Really inconsistent weight,"Review update: After 7 months, this scale no longer works; it does not display a weight, only slashes across the screen. Previous review: I do not recommend this product. I've had the scale for around 6 months. I was really excited to get it so I could measure changes in my weight and composition. While I really like the features such as having your own user settings with height, age, weight, body fat %, and water %, I find that the most important part, accurate and consistent weight, is missing. Today I weighed myself 6 times: 191.4, 192.0, 190.6, 193.0, 189.0, 191.6. I can probably guesstimate by throwing out the outliers and using the average of the others, but who would want to weigh multiple times and average them together each time? The inconsistent weight has a more dramatic effect on body fat % than on actual weight, so it's hard to get a consistent reading on it. I say first and foremost, choose a scale based on weight accuracy."
2,Unstable and unsafe and complicated,This scale is classy looking with a glass surface and feels smooth.It is not easy to set up and complicated.It is also unstable and wobbles and could cause a fall.If you are wanting a pretty scale that you must use caution when weighting this would be good but it flips up when stepping off the scale if your not careful.I did a search for talking scales and this one came up.However it does not speak and has many modes and selections to choose from and is very difficult to use.I would not recommend this for someone who was at a risk for falling.
3,It was great until it died!,I bought this a little over ayear ago because we needed a scale with a higher capasity with a normal price. It was a great scale until it just stopped working even after putting in new batteries. It really sucks when you had weight loss sugery and you are monitoring your weight loss rigorously to not be able to have your weekly weigh in. Time for another scale I guess... but it wont be this one unfortunately.
4,A Ok Scale For The Price,"The scale tends to be about 2 to 3 pounds off but other then that is a pretty good scale, does not go to a random number each time it stays accurate !"
2,Very stylish but not waterproof!!!,"The scale certainly looks very good. Clean, cool and sleek. The functions are sufficient and correct (I compared to my old scale). I do wonder if one really needs 10 different profile settings and if they could have instead put more detail into how you access the fat&water measuring part? I find myself a little clumsy getting it right but it may just be me. What really annoys me though is that it is apparently not water-proof according to the manual. I was going to place the scale in my bathroom and I believe that would be the most common place for a scale. However the manual says to keep the scale away from moisture. So I don't want to risk it. Also, it does not work on carpet, only on a hard ground like bathroom tiles....Now I have to carry my scale from my bedroom into my bathroom when ever I want to use it."
4,Good,"After 8 months of daily use, I'd say it's a pretty good scale. I think it rounds off, and will weigh you more at your historical weight to make the scale look more accurate. For example, it might have me weighing 138.2 for 3 days in a row when it's somewhat improbable for me given my diet or lackthereof. Same thing goes with the bodyfat. As far as the tipping is concerned, I've had the scale tip on me maybe 3 times when I wasn't paying attention. All in all, a pretty sound buy for a bodyfat/water/weight scale."
2,Not very accurate,"depending on how you stand on the scale, and how level your floors are, it can give fluctuating numbers. I'll sometimes need to step on the scale 3-4 separate times in order to get matching readings. I'm looking to replace mine. Will probably spend a little more and go with Tanita."
3,"Weight works, body fat very innacurate","I bought this scale mainly because of its body fat measurement capabilities. I found that measuring weight is pretty accurate, but body fat isn't.I know my BF is around 19-20% and all the readings I get from the Escali are between 11-12% (Ha, I wish...). Tried to find a way to calibrate or something but apparently there isn't (has anyone found the same issue?)I'm fully aware there should be a deviation between different measurement methods, but not this big. Unfortunately, I don't live in the US and don't know if I can send it back.Will see how it performs through time."
3,"Not Great, Not Bad!","Like the scale but everytime you step on it you have ""click"" all the way through the profile you set for yourself before stepping on. Just annoying."
1,Broke after a couple months,The scale worked fine for a couple months but then stopped displaying weight. There was no way to get it out of the program mode. Changing the batteries did not help. The instruction manual did not address the problem.
4,Like it,"Works very well and seems to be pretty accurate as far as the weight goes. The % body fat numbers seem a bit low, but as long as I keep track of the trend, it tells me what I need to know. The only negative is that it seems to burn through the batteries a little quicker than I would like."
2,Malfunction?,I gave this as a gift . The recipient says the weight numbers go up and down but the other readings for water and body fat just stay the same. I don't know if this is a malfunction but it certainly isn't any more helpful than a regular scale at this point.
3,Escali Scale,"It is a good scale, it works as advertised; however, it would help if the digital display was back-lit. Other than that, the Escali-High Capacity scale is worth the money."
2,Missing examples,"The book just names all possibilities and options. You can even download it for free at Adobe's website. It lacks examples, explanations sometimes too short for a beginner. In short words: Not worth to buy."
1,Not what we expected.,When my wife ordered this she was just hoping to get some extra bars and balls. So she should have looked more carefully at what she was buying. This kit comes with 8 translucent bars: 2 in each color. Why would anyone care that the bars are translucent I don't know. The lights don't affect the bars and the bars are barely translucent. You get 5 magnetic balls and 4 lights. This kit is extremenly expensive for what you get and quite frankly the lights and translucent bars are dumb. Shame on us for not looking closer at what we were buying. Shame on the toy company for making such a dumb expansion for Magnetix.
3,Just okay,I like this toy for my son who's into magnets right now at age 7 but I was expecting it to be bigger. It was a very small set for the price.
3,It is so cheap,"I bought it because Amazon recommended it so much. But it is not well recorded, nor well printed. It is very sad that such an opera, with its enormous beauty, is like a children's choir in a remote town in Timbuctu.Do not recommend it. Let's go on buying those who are already consecrated. Thus we won't suffer any disillusion.Eugenia Lizalde"
4,Thorough Theology for an Important Calling,"Mott's book is highly Biblical (the references abound throughout the text) and incorporates a solid understanding of Hebrew culture. I wholeheartedly agree with the majority of his conclusions, though not with the chapter permitting the Christian to use violence to protect the abused and downtrodden. (But this isn't the place for my counter-arguments.)I don't personally agree with some of Mott's theological foundations, but I found that he did a very good job of making the book applicable to those of us of different theological persuasions. If you have major questions about the Biblical foundations for ""social justice"" in the Church, look no further than this book. It is a wonderful wake up for a Church that likes to excuse itself from having to take action because of an overly-internalized and individualistic faith."
2,EEK! This book proved to be dull,"I was required to read this book for my AP English class and had heard how boring it was, but was actually expecting to enjoy it. The first few pieces are rather interesting, while the rest were long and dreary. I guess perhaps if you experienced the time period and actually cared about the issues and places she discussed, this book may appeal to you."
5,Read this book!,LOVE this book...got it so fast.Ordered it to read with a friend and so glad I needed to do that.Everything was good about the purchase experience.Glad I ordered it!
4,Great essayist,"Read this in college and re-read it again years later. Still impressive! My favorites have always been the personal essays in this collection. She captures California in the 60s through first-person accounts, providing a not so sanitized version of the counter culture of the flower children. Her essay On Keeping a Notebook is a must read for any writer!It is no secret that she carefully constructs her sentences, distilling the essence of what she wants to project."
4,les mccann Comment,"I owned this as an LP back in the 70's. MIght not catch my ear if I were hearing for the first time today, but it brings back memories of my younger days"
2,"A comment on ""Comment""","I found Les McCann's ""Comment"" to be a rather weak release from the very talented pianist.""Comment"" is decent soul jazz and it features a lot of singing on the tracks. However, this one plays out more like a bad R&B; album, rather than a jazz album.Also, it's a little too slow for my taste. So if you're looking for something along the lines of his fantastic ""Swiss Movement"" album and other hard-driving soul-jazz, this isn't it.""Comment"" has not aged nicely over the years."
1,Crap,The Atlanta falcons collar I ordered was a medium. The collar I recieved was a xx small does not fit
5,Worth every penny!,"Worth every penny, I really do not know if I need to spend the extra money on power protector like this one but I'm glad that I did, this console performs nicely with my home theater set. I know some people complaining about the LCD Control Panel light! Its not to bad, and for the switched you need to plug your wires to the console first before you power-up, I had the same thing first and then I did some reading and I found out that I need to plug (TV, DVR, ACR,.etc) first and then power the PureAV, this way it will calculate how much power you need.Overall, I'm happy with my choice."
1,Badly Written Book,"I had some interest in the Students for a Democratic Society and the 1960s anti-Vietnam War movement so with Hayden being such a core part of that I decided to read this book. It is, without a doubt in my mind, the single worst book I've ever read. Hayden's ideas are simplistic and his writing style is atrocious. Considering the subject, this could have been a great book encompassing the '68 DNC protests, Vietnam, and the civil rights movement. Instead, Hayden shows how he was in fact in over his head and his lack of knowledge in the subjects he speaks about."
4,Great little popcorn machine with BIG features,"Kudos to Amazon because the first one they sent did not work. I had the replacement on my counter the day AFTER I sent the first one back.My only ""complaint"" about the machine is I still seem to be getting a few too many unpopped kernels. I think it's because the kettle is so small that they tend to jump out with popped ones. It looks to be about a tablespoon or so per half cup.I, too, bought the premeasured packs but once they're gone will switch to using straight coconut oil with regular popcorn salt (probably Flavacol).The popcorn tastes very much like the theater corn and is nice and crispy IF you let it sit on the warmer for a few minutes after you pop it. If you can wait that long it's nice and crunchy. I usually pop 2 batches so there's plenty to go around.Also, it looks so cute on my kitchen counter AND it has a small enough footprint it doesn't take up too much space. I'd definitely recommend this for any popcorn lover."
2,"Good Popcorn, Questionable Lifespan","I've had this 4-oz version for about a year. I use the pre-portioned packs and it does make great popcorn ... the question I have is for how long.I am just finishing up my second case of popcorn (48 total portions) and both levers inside the unit broke off within a week of each other. These breaks are not caused by hard use, but due to the heat causing the plastic to become brittle and crumble. I now must use a hot pad from the kitchen to keep from burning myself in a very tight space. In figuring the amount of popcorn I've popped, I consider mine still a new appliance. Replacing the two knobs (if available) would likely last for two more cases of popcorn.When it's brand new, it has that classic look, and makes great popcorn. Once used for a while it begins aging quickly."
4,Help!! My popcorn is ALWAYS soggy.,"I have followed directions EXACTLY and no matter what kind of popcorn I use, Great Northern, Orville R, or Jolly Time, the popcorn doesn't come out light and fluffy like it should. I've tried different oils as well. It is always soggy.The machine seems OK mechanically.Because of all the rave reviews I've give this a four star because it does seem to function correctly, but maybe doesn't get hot enough or something. I just don't know.If anyone has any input or solutions to what I'm experiencing I'd sure appreciate an e-mail as the wife and I absolutely love theater popcorn and have been ""settling"" for less for years. You can mail me at tom77077@gmail.com. If there is a solution to this problem I'll come back and add another star (if it will let me.)"
4,Fun to have,With having 10 grandkids a batch of popcorn was never enough. With this popper we can have enough for everyone and the popcorn is very good. The only down size is that it takes a lot of storage space.
5,Just Like Movie Popcorn!,"Love this popcorn machine - easy to use and clean. We used the 6oz pre-packaged popcorn kits (kernels, oil, seasoning) and they work great with the 4oz machine. We even use it in our basement theater room and it does not get smoky and stinky. Defininely a good investment and fun for the whole family! Makes delicious popcorn just like the movies!"
5,Perfect for the Popcorn fanatic,"I bought it to save my Tupperware bowls from ruin by my husband making popcorn in them in the microwave. This unit makes great popcorn and makes enough for about 4 people at a time (or one husband who loves popcorn). Easy to assemble, looks good in the home theater. A good buy for folks who like a lot of popcorn."
2,Have Strong Teeth,"I found the machine easy to assemble and use. I was really looking forward to my first batch but found that no matter how I tweaked it, the popcorn came out tough and basically tasteless. I've tried it with butter oil, different brands of popcorn and different ratios of oil to corn and can't come up with a way to make it work the way I want it. Too bad. It's really a fun thing to have and display and it's also fun to watch it work. Now if I could only eat the resulting popcorn. It's back to the microwave, I'm afraid!"
3,Good until it wasn't,"I got this through Costco as a gift several years ago. It did well and we so loved using it that we started doing double batches with good success. It spits out a fair amount of un-popped kernels, but all kettles will and it didn't seem to be a larger than reasonable amount.After several years of good use the kettle just stopped heating one day. I traced the problem to the kettle itself and I'm now looing for a replacement kettle, which doesn't seem to be easy to find. It is sold through the manufacturer as EPM-450-kettle, currently out of stock. I hope to overcome that hurdle and get back into popcorn again!"
4,YAY POPCORN,"I BOUGHT THIS AS A GIFT FOR MY HUSBAND-HE LOVES MOVIE THEATER POPCORN. THIS UNIT SITS PERFECT ON THE COUNTER, WE DO HAVE TO MAKE MORE THEN ONE BATCH WHEN PEOPLE ARE OVER BUT IT DOESN'T TAKE LONG. IT WAS DELIVERED QUITE QUICKLY AND WE USED IT THE DAY WE GOT IT. JUST NEED TO ALWAYS PURCHASE THE PACKETS OR BOTTLES OF THE POPPING OIL. WE TRIED IT WITH REG OIL AND IT WAS NOT GOOD. WE EVEN TAKE THE UNIT WITH US WHEN WE GO TO THE INLAWS FOR THE WEEKEND, THE KIDS LOVE IT!!"
2,Cleaning nightmare.,"Yes, it does make very good popcorn...but what a mess. The entire inside gets covered with oil splatter. I guess this machine would be great if you really need production, but for us, the causual user...way too much trouble."
1,Terrible from cover to cover,"The simpliest way to describe the novel is that it misses both the original work (the Electric Sheep story by Dick) and the movie (Bladerunner) by a long shot.Jeter simply isn't as good of a writer as Dick was, nor was he as blatantly crazy and it's the sheer bizarre nature that gave Dick's writing a lot of what it had. Jeter also doesn't seem to be upon the Bladerunner side as in the novel he openly mocks the question of Deckard being a replicant.No, if you want a true sequel for the Bladerunner movie, instead try to find the Bladerunner PC game from the mid-90s. It feels like Bladerunner much more than any of Jeter's dreadful novels.[...]"
3,Good for what it is.,"This is a movie-nerds' wet dream. This is what they'd all wished had been done with Highlander. A continuation of the movie's story in the style of Dick's book, with multiple scenes which are reproductions or reflections from the original (another Deckard/Batty fight in the rain on decaying city infrastructure). Pretty good for the Geekbook mindcandy category.Pretty bad in just about every other way."
3,Sequel to the original Blade Runner.,"I found the story-line following the movie version both good and dissappointing. I would have hoped for a movie tie-in, plot-wise, but follow the original story more faithfully. All in all, not that bad a book."
2,Not that great.,"This is the 3rd installment in the Bladerunner series. It has a few interesting ideas, but overall did not move fast enough to keep me interested. I did manage to finish, but really had to force myself. Some scenes seem very similar to the premise of Bioshock, the new highly acclaimed game for the XBox 360."
2,Disappointing.,"Mr. Jeter did a good job in presenting Ridley Scott's gloomy ""feel"" of the futuristic Los Angeles. However, he should have devoted more time to develop the story instead. He had a good story to tell. It just needed to be polished."
3,good but a little off the wall,The second Blade Runner book is a good read especially to fans of the movie like myself. The movie does have a few things that are confusing. Some characters are alive in this book who originally died in the movie.Jeter is a great author but he should have gone all the way with this one instead of trying to squeeze in unexplained resurrected characters.This is a must have for BR buffs
1,You will have a hard time making it through this.,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. When reading it you never even identify with the main character ""Deckard"". The plot is totally different than the movie. Did the author even see the movie? A high school kid could write better than jeter. I read another of his books once, it was better but it seems he can't think up a good plot."
3,"Good ideas, missing ideas","This book advocates for a new kind of social justice unionism that goes beyond bread & butter issues (like salaries) to placing teacher unions at the forefront of school reform in order to better serve students.There are a lot of valid and interesting points raised by various contributors, but the book emphasizes teacher/administrator collaboration on school reform to the detriment of a discussion about building union power in the first place.How do we put teachers in the driver's seat? How do fight for the decent compensation that many districts still lack? Social justice unionism is based on a weak premise if it isn't based on a militant union willing to go to mat for what's right. (And I whole heartedly agree that our unions, and not private corporations, should be at the forefront of school reform.)"
2,The case that didn't fit right,This case was a poor fit and came in a plastic sleeve making returns difficult if not impossible. I would suggest on waiting for a slim custom fit bi-fold case when one becomes available.
2,Case is a bad fit,This case didn't fit well at all. The bottom left of the unit kept popping out and when I forced it in the unit popped out at the bottom. Also it comes in a plastic sleeve that you have to cut with a scissor. This makes returns very difficult. Save your money and wait for a slim bi-fold case.
2,It's okay.,"The wallet adds girth to the handheld, which takes away from the best feature of the treo 90 - its puny size. It's a good case to store the handheld in for a backpack, or a briefcase, and it has spaces for credit cards and memory cards, but you have to remove the protective cover to use the wallet. The buttons, which are usually protected from being pressed, are not protected in this wallet. The flap folds down over the screen, but it's not a great design. I own this and also the sports case and I usually only use the sportscase. Althought the sportscase is too large to keep it housed in and fit into your frontpocket, I just carry around my Treo90 out of its case as it's so small anyway and is protected by its cover window. When I return it to my backpack, I keep it in the sportscase. I wouldn't recommend this wallet."

2,honda repair manual,"this manual is not as well written as with the Haynes manuals, so it was rather useless as a repair manual, my recommendation is to always find a Haynes manual, too bad Chilton bought out Haynes, this particular manual is junk, don't buy it, I have 4 repair manuals for my 1988 Honda Accord LXi, I use all 4, but the best is the Shop Manual, second best is a Haynes manual, and the Chilton manuals are no good, especially for in depth work."
2,Very general - not for novices,"A prior review says ""this book is useless."" Well, I wouldn't go that far. The problem is that the book covers all models - Civic, Accord, Prelude, CRX - for 6 years. It is not always clear what instructions apply to my car (83 Civic Wagon). Much of the book is filled with boilerplate from the Chilton files. With some experience, the amateur can extrapolate and interpolate to figure out what is needed, but the book is not as good as it ought to be. It is a LOT better than nothing."
3,Good enough value,"I bought this package because it actually would have cost me less than buying just the receiver and ball. Those are exactly the quality I'd expected. I required a 2"" lift rather than drop so I had to undo the ball and install it the other way. If you are planning to do this take note that you need a 1.5"" wrench and a lot of muscle to undo that nut. Lucky for me I have a brother with both.The locking pin is okay but I have no use for it since I'd already purchased another one. The hitch cap cover is useless as it falls out just by touching it, never mind driving. The storage bag is not very impressive. Just medium weight nylon and poorly sewn/finished inside. I'm using it anyways just to keep everything neat and clean inside the car."
5,nature's studio,"I've received my book and have not put it down, this book has more information than I thought. I love how the author goes into great detail as to why and how she creates these great quilts. This will go into my collection of landscape and pictorial quilts.Thanksannette parsons"
5,Fantastic,"This is a fantastic book. If you are starting out in Art Quilting, this book is a must.Very clear instructions and photo's.A great book that builds your confidence and still allows you to be creative."
4,Very good...but,I bought this as a present originally and we have been watching it continuously. I can't be angry with the quality since it is very good especially on my HDTV. however I have noticed that there is a weird compatiability issue with these discs and my macbook pro. If it worked perfectly on it then I would have given it 5 stars
5,Dexter,"This is, hands down, the best show I have ever seen and is my favorite show of all time. Everyone should watch this show. I've seen all of the seasons and it never falters in the slightest."
5,DEXTER IS AWESOME!!,MY DAUGHTER TOLD ME ABOUT DEXTER AS WE DID NOT HAVE DIRECT TV AT THE TIME AND DID NOT GET THE CHANNEL THE SHOW WAS ON. WE BOUGHT THE DVD'S AND ARE SO GLAD WE DID. THEN WE GOT DIRECT TV SO WE COULD GET THE NEW SEASON AND WE WAITED WITH BAITED BREATH FOR THE NEW SHOWS TO COME ON EVERY WEEK. CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEW SEASON!!
1,It skips!,I had to skip some episodes since not all worked! So disappointed i decided to just give it away. Should have listened to other reviews
3,not super quality but fine enough to watch,"Just got turned on to Dexter and my husband and I wanted to catch up on the first 5 seasons we missed. The quality of the picture is not what I would have expected, sometimes fuzzy, sometimes too dark. The image never gets really sharp. Other than that, the delivery came quickly. Paid a lot of money for this package (which I have never done before) and feel a little cheated."
3,Good......But something bad,"So I love the Dexter series. Love it. But why the 3 stars you ask? on one of my disks.....I couldn't play the season finale. Upon looking at the disk and freaking out it was my DVD player, It looks as if the disk had been stamped wrong (the circle in the middle of the DVD....there that but an exact indented replica of that circle next to it which runs over into the actual recorded part) So I'm out the third season finale. Which I'm not happy with and im stuck with that ONE disk that is like that.BUT with that being said I do love Dexter. Great series"
2,Dexter Videos,"I love Dexter and am only only the 3rd of the 5 seasons I purchased. I am a little unhappy with the quality of the video however. I watched season one from a friend and decided to order my own set. The picture is not clear at all like hers was. It's not horrible, but looks like it was a copy or something....... not a quality video :("
3,Not Everyone's Cup Of Tea,"The show attempts to be clever -- make a serial killer -- who kills serial killers -- someone we can root for. It doesn't really hit that goal. Dexter is a homicidal maniac, who loves to butcher people. He gets a thrill out of it. He is not out for justice. In the end, he is a psychotic vigilante who imagines he serves the public good by eliminating killers. What makes the show interesting, is how close he comes to being caught in each episode. But do we sympathize, or empathize with him -- is he a hero? No. He is a serial killer.Three stars for production values, acting, and plots."
2,Great Show,"It is a great show, but you can watch it on net flix via the internet. Why would you pay 127.00."
1,Great show but this particular product is overpriced. See review.,"This is cheaper if you buy each season separately... (PLEASE NOTE: This review is for the DVD version, not the Blu-ray)Check out these product links. It seems odd to pay so much for a cardboard sleeve. Click on the following product links and save some money:Dexter: The First SeasonDexter: The Second SeasonDexter: The Third SeasonDexter: The Fourth SeasonDexter: The Fifth Season"
2,Dexter seasons 1-5,Problems with season 1 dvd. Scrambled and Dvd player said invalid dvd on the second dvd.couldn't watch at all. Notified merchant and they are sending a new season 1. we'll see how that is and will be getting back to you on that.
5,The Best Series,I started watching Dexter when it first came out. I was addicted from the very beginning. The characters and the story line keep you captivated. The only problem was waiting a week till the next show...and then waiting months till the next season. After the first season ended I started buying the show...one season at a time. Each year before the season started I would watch every season preceding the present one. I have as I have said purchased one at a time. So many people are now aware of the show but haven't had the chance to watch past seasons. This is a gift I have given to those people that have just made the discovery and love what they see. Well worth buying...I know I will watch this series over and over for years to come.
4,Dexter 1-5,"Great series! There were a few gliches with the DVD's...pausing in a couple spots. I had to skip ahead more than once, but overall the quality was good."
5,Scrape the syrum from my tongue!,"Sheesh, this EP is a treat! I've been listening to this gem since it's release in '99 and it sounds just as good as it did when I first heard it back then. Definitely under-rated. If you like post-hardcore with Euro-metal influence, treat your ears to some Frozen Divide.Track 4... just... wow. =)"
4,Church,This book was written by my husbands grandfather so we wanted to get a copy. He was a mormon but this book is very interesting. I thought though small it had a lot of information.
4,Ten Thousand Tears - audio book,"The video version was so clearly articulated that one could not help but continue listening to the story. Lee has such a clear, undistinct dialect. Her spoken words were so comfortable to my ear and the creativity of the writing painted the visuals in my mind.I hated and yet felt empathy for her father and mother and loved the childlike rebellion Lee spent toward her grandmother. It brought a sense of relief for me since I was so caught up in the harshness of her life. I enjoyed the experience I had while listening to this book."
4,exactly as described.. OOPS! My bad!,"got exactly what i ordered, as described. but i should have read a little closer to notice that, although these are just like the metal jacks we played as kids, they are too large to re-create the challenge of playing like back-n-the-day."
5,"great set of Jacks, just like the good old days","Perfect size jacks, generously comes with two balls and instructions. Plus a very cool metal box. I don't think you can find a better set anywhere today."
3,Jacks are fine...balls are not,"The quality of the jacks is quite good, and the metal box as well. However, the 2 balls included have a low density - they feel very light and do not bounce as well as more dense jacks balls. We replaced them right away with bouncy balls from a vending machine which gave a much higher and more consistent bounce."
2,ONE GREAT GEM,"MY LOVE FORGIVE ME, WAS ALL I WANTED FROM THIS ALBUM. THE VERSION HERE SOUNDS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM THOSE ON OTHER ALBUMS. I LISTENED TO ALL OF THEM AND DECIDED ON THIS VERSION. I ALSO LIKE ON A CLEAR DAY, WHICH APPEARS ON SOME OTHER ALBUMS."
3,OK but not my favorite of his,"This has great titles and I sure got great, speedy service but the style is a faster, jazzier presentation that I prefer. His voice is great - I just prefer the rich, full majestic style."
4,mandatory buy,"I had to buy this book for my Program Evaluation: Advanced Research Methods course in grad school. I was worried that it would be an extremely dry read, but it's really not bad. Pleasantly surprised."
5,Hopi Indian Art,Nampeyo was a treasure and MaryEllen Blair did a great job of research. This book belongs on the shelf of every library and Indian Art Collector. It has an amazing genealogy of Nampeyo and her family and ancestors. This is a terrific reference book and full of good read.
1,dissapointed,could nor figure out how to put two halves together to make a whole one and come out without breaking. I have made several molds in the past and was very dissapointed
3,Short and sweet,"This is a middle of the road entry for the Inspector Rebus series. Of course, being a short work, there just isn't room for a much of the exposition that makes Rebus such an interesting character to read about, which is honestly my caveat about most short stories in any genre. Ultimately, Death is Not the End, is a very brief view into the world of Rebus and the Edinburgh underworld. For new readers, this is not the place to start with this series, but I can see how completists would want to mark this off their to-be-read lists."
3,A slight episode in the Inspector Rebus series,"I am a fan of this series, but this is one volume I will unlikely think of again. It's not bad, but I don't really recommend paying $12 for a copy of it. Borrow it from the library or buy a used copy. In spite of the blurb on the book's jacket flap, I don't think this is even a good introduction to the character."
2,This is a great series but not this book.,The Inspector Rebus Mystery series by Ian Rankin is well worth the read. Start at the beginning and read the books in order but feel free to skip this short book as it adds little to the series.
1,Horrible!,"Ripoff! Seventy-three pages, at least forty of which are a direct lift from his last book. If you like Ian Rankin or have read his books in the past, don't waste your money on this."
3,Basta,I expected to hear them play more I think his search for Jimmy should have been on another DVD Basta
2,"Please, please, stop!","As an avid fan of Hamilton and other great sci-fi writers, I find it difficult to plow my way through Benford's mess. The story idea is good, but Benford's writing is positively awful. At times he can't even seem to make up his mind what tense he's writing in. Initial charater development is next to nonexistent, and following character dialogue is somewhat akin to finding one's way around a corn maze at midnight. He uses what seems to be an alsmost experimental approach to dialogue, and no two are formatted the same. Sentence structure is immature and disjointed. Its either incredibly simple, or so complicated it becomes difficult to follow. Some character situations are wildly implausible even for sci-fi, or underdeveloped to the point that they seem so. I would not recommend this book. I am no writer, but I can recognize great writing and this isn't it."
5,MUCH BETTER TEN SONIC RUSH,THE GAME IS GREAT. I LOVE THAT YOU GET TO USE THE PEN MORE AND THE WATERSETTING MAKES ME FEEL LIKE YOU I IN AM IN THE OCEAN.SONIC ROCKS.
1,Instant headache maker,"I am a huge fan of the Sonic games in general, but this game was way to frenetic for me. The fact that the game goes between the two screens on the DS as you're moving through the levels makes it very difficult to figure out where you are at any given time. Since time is a factor in your score, trying to get through a level quickly is nearly impossible to make sure you're hitting the bonuses. I played the game for about 10 minutes before I got a splitting headache and gave up on it. Fortunately, I rented the game before I bought it, so only a few dollars wasted."
4,Better than the first Sonic Rush,"I've been playing Sonic games since the original came out, but I feel like the DS versions really give you the sense of speed that you should feel when playing Sonic.I like this better than the first Sonic Rush because the music is not as annoying.It also has stages where you have to ride ships to get to a destination (in 3D) but I don't see myself playing those again for fun anytime soon.The replay value is high though - there are lots of challenging missions and its hard to resist the urge not to get an S rank in every level.Also two playable characters - Blaze and Sonic - keep things interesting enough.The reason I like playing Sonic games is because they give me a break from the often slow-moving RPGs I play, and this one gets the job done. You can clear levels ridiculously fast, and that's why I love it."
3,Just not like the original.,"This game is kind of fun. You get some of the same high speed action as in the original Sonic. However, navigating through the different levels can be frustrating and some of the levels become pretty repetitive. Still, not a bad game for some occassional entertainment."
5,Truly a quality item!,"Yes I know they are just measuring spoons BUT, the quality is so high you would think that they were made by Rolls Royce! They just feel good to use, the markings are clear and the bowl shape is convenient. Well worth the cost you will have them forever."
1,Not helpful,"These are NOT cute names for 1/4, or 1/2 spoon fulls, but made up sizes! If recipie asks for ""just 1/2 spoon of xxx, this does NOT have 1/2, it has ""A smigen"". which is not a cute name for 1/2."
2,No 1/2 Tbsp!,"I would buy this set, but it does not include a 1/2 Tbsp. Very handy when splitting recipies. Why don't more manufacturers include this measurement?"
4,bat house,"I bought it for my husband who works outside in the evenings and got bitten by mosquitoes. He read that bats eat about 500 mosquitoes an hour, we had one bat around our area, but it is gone now and I guess it explains mosquito's outbreak. We hope to get bat back one day. This Bat House well made, it is important to buy from certified organization, because it is like buying animal cage - 1st of all it should be safe. House has mash inside for bats to hold to, made of cedar, assembled with screws not nails. I like bat logo on it, so for everyone is clear what purpose it serves. Best if it could come with some easy hanging device."
4,Great Product,"I had done some research on the various types of bat houses, and the OBC sanctioned ones came out out on top for many reasons. It may not be the most ""trendy"" of the options, but functionality is what counts. It's well constructed and sturdy. We're looking forward to providing a new home for our bats!"
5,best bathouse,"Well made,excellent materials used,bats will enjoy their five star accommodations,I put it up too late to attract bats this fall (Nov.7),"
3,No bats yet,"The construction of the house is as exactly as stated, but we transplanted bats that we cleaned out of our attic and none of the bats stayed in the house. That was over a month ago and still no bats. We put the house up exactly like the instructions. My other issue with the house is that the bottom is completely open and there is a large slit on the front so I'm not sure how the bats can stay warm in it. It seems air would blow around inside of it easily."
1,Plywood De-Laminates,The back of this bat house - a piece of plywood - has become de-laminated after just 8 months outside in the weather. I doubt it was exterior rated plywood. I will be contacting the manufacturer. Terrible.
2,"2 YEARS, NO BATS?","I believe I hung this up two or three years ago. I know there are bats around, but not in this house. Construction seems good, but at this point in time, it is only a nice cedar showpiece."
2,Bat house,"I was excited to get this as a gift. I painted with a black water based paint as suggested and installed it on a 20' pole. The problem I have is that after a few months the back board is starting to delaminate and looks like it is going to rot. If I was going to sell an item that would be out in the weather I would use materials that are resistant to moisture, like cedar, or a marine grade wood. This obviously is not the quality that I thought. I would not purchase this item and would simply find a better quality one."
4,"Nice, classic light","This light is very nice looking and much better made then other lights I had purchased (and suseqeuntly returned). The only negative about this light is that there is only one attachment of the light to the base so it makes it like a teeter-totter and can become mis-aligned if bumped, but mostly this is not a problem."
2,Sounds better than it works,"I find that the old plastic bowl scrapers still work better. I thought the silicone would be an improvement (like the silicone spatulas). Unfortunately, the silicone bowl scraper is rather stiff so you have to bear down hard to make it conform to the bowl, this in turn makes it catch so that it is difficult to scrape out the bowl."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"Even at the ~$7, as opposed to the current $15 price tag, it was no bargain. The more flexible white polyethylene bowl scrapers widely available at $3 each will do the job equally well--or better-- and for far less money.Postage rates ruling out its return as unsatisfactory merchandise, and its heft and aerodynamics suiting it to the job, I have decided to practice with it daily and keep it handy on my kitchen counter for dispatching the odd rodent that escapes the family cat."
3,A suggestion,"I think my previous review probably won't make it because I swore on that. So I'm going to be kind and improvise a lil here again.It would be *advisable* to NOT paste the awefdfsaf price tag on the keychain ITSELF. Because when we remove it there will be ALOT of adferfwer sticky white paper bits on the keychain awefasdfWhen I received it and saw the price tag on the keychain, I was like asefwefasdf who in their right minds would do it that way?!Feel like I wasted my eff-ing money... Well I'll stop here now, not gonna buy from Old Glory anymore."
1,Gearbox leaks and damages paint,"Gearbox began leaking grease onto pad holder throwing it everywhere on my new paint job. Could not figure it out at first because it seemed that the compound was wax based or something. This grease is very hard to remove once buffed into your paint, it kinda turns to a candle wax consistency. Very unhappy cause its going to take a while to repair the paint. Of course the manufacturer will not help because they are in hong kong somewhere......."
3,What wool buffing pad?,"I just opened my package and did not see a wool pad. Although, the box did not list a wool pad, I wondering what the others recieved. Yes, it is heavy but this is my first one so I don't really know if this is the norm. The unit also looks like it's been refurbished...not a bad thing by definition. I will try it soon.... after I go out for buffing pads thought one was in the box)"
3,"Wonder anyone have parts information for CT6101 7"" buffer.",I am looking the diagram and parts info where i can order. some parts are worning out. I use it alot.thanks
1,"Heavy, Loud and Broken",Worked for the first 15 minutes. While buffing it was really loud and heavy. After 20 minutes it began to slow down and finally stopped working. I read the reviews and realized I am not the only one that has had this problem. Because it was a gift I can't return it and cant find anything online or in the box about the manufacture and sending it back. I highly recommend spending a little extra money and getting a good polisher.
3,ok,product came as listed. No one had mentioned how loud the thing was. I had used it of a total of ten minutes and it had sounded as if it was grinding gravel in the gears. My wife had come out to the garage several times to see what all the noise was. Bottom line was it was way loud and if it was correct in the production build then make sure you wear ear plugs 'cause this thing is noisey.
2,Junk,"I have had to get two of these because the first one I received malfunctioned straight out of the box. I used it for about 2 hours, went to try it again the next morning and the thing wouldn't run. They sent me another which has acted up a few times but operated enough for me to buff scratches out of my friends car. Buy a name brand, not this thing."
5,car and Truck variable speed polisher,Works like a champ. Very good purchase. Easy to use and performs very well.
2,what buffing pad fits this model?,"first of, i think i may have gotten a reconditioned item as the packaging is somewhat distressed plus mine didn't come with a wool pad as other have stated. my prob is that i bought the meguair's w4000 wool pad which is about a 1/2 inch smaller in diameter, so when i tried it on the backing plate, it wouldn't sit flushed. so anybody here that knows the exact model of a compatible wool pad, pls chime in.i'd like to order the makita but have no idea what model specifically. tnx in advance for any inputs shared. btw, i got this from etools which i'm not using the next time. sold me a recon and i'm not returning as shipping is way to expensive."
4,Magnetix Flexors Set - need more,They are super and make it great for hours of playing! The only thing I can complain about is there aren't enough Flexors! (They need to come in bigger sets.)
1,Too Biased to Be Accurate,"I borrowed this book from my library, hoping to learn something about the Puritans. Instead, I learned that Mr. Aronson believes the Puritans to be little better than the Taliban, and Charles I to be a well-intentioned ruler desperately trying to maintain peace within his country in spite of the ""fire-breathing religious zealot[s]."" Yes, he uses that phrase in narrative, and not in an ironic way, either.Mr. Aronson doesn't bother with the opinions of the Puritans. He doesn't consider that the ""religious extremists"" may have had a point in wanting to change the Church of England. Charles I would be very happy with this book; he would have turned it into a pamphlet warning his people about the big, bad Puritans.Please don't buy this book. Please don't borrow it from your library. The author doesn't deserve your support. Not for writing his opinion and calling it ""history."""
4,Great little cookbook,"I am so glad I ordered this cookbook, I married a man whose relatives are from New Orleans...So it comes in handy!!!It has a lot of great classic recipes. The cookbook was used , but in great condition.Thank you for the preview of the book, that was a big selling point.R. Warren"
5,A trip with Trollope,"Anthony Trollope was arguably the most readable of the Victorians. Just as his novels have held up, so does his autobiography in which he reveals a refreshing look at the literature of his times. He was a down-to-earth guy, expressing common sense about the craft of writing and the writing life. I highly recommend it for any reader or writer."
2,Cameron's other titles are more useful to you as a writer,"Julia Cameron's books are the only companions that keep me from feeling stuck and isolated in a writer's life. ""The Artist's Way"" and ""The Sound of Paper"" are fixtures on my bedside table because she's truthful, sensible, and uplifting. ...And that's why I'm disappointed in this book. It falls very short of the mark.True, in its pages you will recognize all those people who hem you in or hold you up. But you will perhaps also recognize what I did: deep bitterness. I'm 3/4 through the book and have been almost stunned at all the examples of, asides about, and ungloved swipes at movie industry people. Other blocking personalities are treated with a bit of remove and wry humor. But when JC launches on the movie-industry-specific examples, her venom and bitterness seep through. That flaw discredits whatever [thin] usefulness I might previously have found. I hate to say this, but I'm glad I bought it used rather than new."
5,Absolutely Outstanding!,What a great investment!? This recording is fantastic. The two Greats in their last show together. Get it!
2,Not as tasty as one would hope,"I am a big eggnog fan, but this did not taste as good as using actual eggnog. I recommend Jim Beam brand"
5,Christmas in a glass,"If egg nog is synonymous with Christmas for you, this is the syrup for you! We add just one tablespoon to 2 oz espresso and 8 oz hot milk for a delicious beverage and much less cost than the coffee houses. Enjoy!"
3,it feels hard for me to say this..,"but i dont get this album,the songs are not as good as his first and ""songs of love and hate"", 3 stars from me because,it's an uneven record,and that makes it hard to listen to,it sound's like some songs are 10 years older then others. best songs: Story of issac,lady midnight and tonight will be fine."
4,Not What You're Expecting - But Better!,"""Child is Father..."" is not what most people think of when they think of Blood, Sweat & Tears - but it is a lostclassic of '60s jazz-rock. David Clayton-Thomas had not yet joined the group and turned it into Chicago'smain soul-pop rival. For BST's first album, the group's brainchild and leader was keyboardist Al Kooper, aNew Yorker with a knack for sounding British. Kooper must be credited with fusing the horn section with therock band, and BST's classic horn riffs are clearly evident on this recording. However, unlike more popularBST recordings, ""Child is Father..."" has a more eclectic jazz- and folk-rock sound. Try combining equal partsearly Chicago, Steve Winwood's Traffic, and Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac, and you'll have a pretty goodidea of the sound. It is, quite simply, a unique classic."
5,Classic,"It sounds so good even today, but only few can understand the progress that BS&T made by that album. In the 60's it sounded so special, so uniqe, and today it sounds ""just"" as a great album, one of the best in rock music. No need to review every song, though there are few well known (""I love you more than you'll ever know"", Harry Nilsson's ""Withoiut her"", ""I can't quit her"", ""Morning glory""). The album from ""Overture"" to ""So much love"" is one solid gold unit."
2,Too expensive for what it is,"The Warn units do not have the quality of the US made units at this price point. In fact, Columbus McKinnon units can be had for slightly cheaper price. Here they are compared:-Made in China (Warn) vs US (CM)-Painted finish (Warn) vs galvanized (CM)-lower load rating (4-3/4 ton for Warn vs 6-1/2 ton for CM)Warn needs to price these along the lines of Smittybuilt and other Chinese sourced shackles."
1,don't waste your money!,"I bought this baby monitor at Babies R Us when my daughter was little, and only ended up using it recently because she used to sleep in her play yard instead of her room. It's too bad I didn't try it out before, because then I could have gotten my money back!The handheld monitor is very annoying, because all I hear is static...even when there are no phones, television or computers being used. It also stops working for no apparent reason (when it is stationed in the same place) and I have to go up into my daughter's room, change the frequency channel, and risk waking her up while doing so. Several times I have heard a loud static that seems to come from the part of the monitor that stays in her room...and that's exactly what happens!I can hear my daughter when she wakes up (crying) and I like being able to speak to her over the monitor, but it's just not worth buying this product!"
1,not functional,"I thought I'd try this since I was desperate and it was cheap, but as someone who studied engineering, I really should've known better. Whoever created this has got to be relying on the desperation/gullibility of people. How in the world is a thin sticker, no matter what's painted on it, supposed to catch some ambiguous ""rays"" and use that to boost signal? Just think about it."
1,I aint saying it's a piece of junk....,"I aint saying it's a piece of junk as it may work on TDMA/analog phones but it did nothing for my Nokia on a CDMA network. I live in a small rural village that doesn't have a stoplight or very good cell coverage. I get one bar for signal strength. I found these for sale for fifty cents each plus a couple bucks postage, so thought I'd give one a go. Nah....I still only get one bar. I wish it worked but it doesn't...welcome to my world."
1,No Improvement,Absolutely no improvement anywhere all signal stayed the same I was hoping for atleast 1 bar but nothing was gained
4,This item works pretty well,"This was the cheapest one I could find, and that""s what i wanted. They all work about the same...i've used more expensive ones in the past. This one doesn't always make a real big difference but just enough of one. Most of the time I have full signal strength now. So I would deffinately say this was well worth the money. Don't buy the $10 or $20 dollar ones when this works perfectly fine."
2,not that good,"I ordered it in hopes that it would do something, but im convinced that it serves absolutely no purpose. However in an attempt to sound fair, it might have raised the bar by one level, but i just don't think so."
1,Do not waste your time.,"Simple stated, it doesn't do diddly.Do not waste your time and effort on this product,unless you are a big fan of shiny stickers that do nothing."
3,There is a problem!,"The manufacturer does not mention a minor detail. This generator consumes almost 200 cubic feet of natural gas per hour at 11-14"" of water column pressure. This is TWICE the pressure of a residential intallation so this unit requires a seperate gas meter. Find out BEFORE you buy whether the gas company will switch out the meter and help with the piping. Your house will require two pressures, 6"" for your regular appliences and furnace and 12-14"" for the generator. The generator does work, but it is NOT easy to install.I have now owned this generator for two years and can tell you that it is flawless in it's performance and it's automation. It starts itself every Saturday at noon and runs for 15 minutes. I have had one blackout and it turned itself on and functioned without a hitch. Great insurance is hard to find, this is one."
2,Generac 15Kw Model 04390,"The starter motor failed within the first 6 months. The installer did not correctly diagnose the problem, and Generac was of no help. It was only after I found a post on the Internet about this problem that I was able to get the generator fixed. Generac ""played dumb"" not acknowledging thatthey had many problems with the starter and finally replaced it with an improved unit. The cabinet is now rusting out, even though I waxed it annually and sprayed the interior with WD-40 several times a year. The generator is very loud and fuel consumption is high."
4,Good unit for the money,"This is a pretty decent unit for the money. The only problem I've had is that the starter went out just after the warranty expired. The starters are EXPENSIVE but I think I'll probably find one online somewhere for a much better price than what Guardian is asking. Otherwise, this is a good generator. I have some electrical experience and was able to install it myself. If you aren't experienced though, it would probably be best to have it professionally installed."
3,Large Print not so large,"""Large Print is not so large.....There was no sample or specificatrion on the font size. Not sure, but the font is a 10 or so, not too good for someone with poor eyesight or someone who has to use a magnifying glass in addition to glasses."
3,Large Print Compared to older micro print Bibles,"I like the Bible I received, but it can hardly be considered ""large print."" If you compare it to older micro print (8 point font) bibles, then it could be considered large print. I was expecting more like 14 point font. I'll keep it and use it, but it is still difficult to read. I'm only fifty but have been visually impaired since age three."
4,another classic firesign theatre,"If you are not familiar with these guys, they are a irrational comedy group that played on the radio in the late sixties(?) Therefore they lend themselves well to audio cd. You got to imagine these guys were smoking the good stuff when they wrote these albums. It takes a little concentration to catch all that is going on, but it absolutley hilarious and well written and performed. If you like this one,order the others...have an adult beverage or two or whatever and temporarily enter the world of firesign theatre. You'll want to share with your friends."
3,Almost turned me off Firesign.,"I'm 23 (as of this review) and I am lucky to have heard of Firesign Theatre at all. This album is the first I have purchased and it almost made me never want to hear so much as the troupe's name again. The first half of this album is a stream-of-conciousness string of annoying sounds and voices that never seem to have any coherent point to get across. It is drawn out, confusing, irritating and painfully, horrifically unfunny.The second half is the only reason to get this CD and the only reason I didn't chuck it out the window of a moving train. The Nick Danger piece is very funny and entertaining. The Naked Gun meets Monty Python sketch works very well with some hilarious wordplay, one-liners and random silliness (""Nick! Nick! Wake up! And stop hitting me!""). It is the album's saving grace and the one thing that made me want to pursue more of Firesign's material."
4,Takes me back to the early Seventies every time.,"Didn't know who the FT was until I got out on my own and moved down to the Southern Part of Southern Cal. Had a neighbor who was a LT in the Navy who turned me on to them. I agree that this wasn't the best album, but I still shoot out Nike Danger quotes when someone drops a straight line to me (without them knowing it). Would love to have a re-release of ""Don't crush"" and ""Everything you know"", have lost the LP's and my two remaining cassettes are getting real worn out. These guys were great, would buy a package set of all the old albums placed on CD in a heart beat.... No comment on the ""Give me Immortality"" album, either I've matured or they have. Just give me a chance at all the old stuff again."
2,Stream of consciousness is funny for 30 seconds.,"I suppose if you're really really stoned, this is funny. On the other hand, if you're really really stoned, Firing Line is funny.You can dig a few comedy nuggets out of this, but they're buried inside a ton of nothing."
2,"Groundbreaking in its time, which has come and gone","We owe much to the Firesign Theater, for their pushing progressive social agenda and redefining entertainment. They stood out in their time (the 1960's), which was very hard to do in view of exceptional competition. Yet, they do not necessarily pass the ""classics"" test, that is, the reaching out and grabbing of audiences with the current day mindset. Any popular history of America, especially in the chapter covering the 1960's, has to give the Firesign Theater its due. Whether you want to pay for them here and now is more in question."
1,hahhha,this crap is terrible .id rather watch the simpsons than this 111111 come on its like 'the fox passed a gas station' and then they all start laughing..what a waste of time..
4,a blast from the past,"I heard this album when I was 17 (a very very long time ago). Its very strange content, and funny to some. It was nice to hear it again.The case was cracked and the lid does not stay on the case, which is why I gave it a 4 rating."
4,The Buckeye,"While this is a great reliable bow, it is no good at taking down game. If your are a hunter steer clear of this bow."
3,Aluminum Pet Ram p,Purchased this item to get dogs into my chassis mount dog truck rather then have them jumping in and out. I purchased this length (for weight and storage size) which was at the upper limit of the height for my truck and wish I had purchased the longer one. My labs don't like using it much. I think that the sand paper type surface may be abrasive on their feet and they can't get as good a grip because of the angle on the shorter ramp. I am planning on either buying the longer one or recovering this surface with rubber matting or both. Product is well made and easy to use I think the main problem was my size choice.
3,Cute but with issues,"These run small, and are narrow, so either order larger or never wear socks. The bright pink inside printing rubs off onto your socks anyway. Also, they are starting to rip out near the frayed edges of the patches, after only a couple of wearings, so I'd save these for special occasions, not everyday shoes."
1,Worst Aesop's fables storytelling,"This DVD has only a few stories (11), definitely not worth the money I spent. Worse, many of the stories were twisted from the original and have a clear taste of Indian flavor. Worst, the word ""STUPID"" is used in many conversations. It is surely inappropriate for young children unless you want your kids to get into a habbit of saying ""stupid"" in every sentence. This is a terrible product."
4,Great Vacuum,"This is a great vacuum. Small and very powerful and can be used as a blower. The vacuum wasn't packaged very well when it was shippid though, I can see a small dent on it. It seems to run fine. The directions were a bit thin too. I would buy this again without a doubt."
2,Disappointment,"No where near the first CD which I think is great. Sophmore slump here. If you lie the first then buyer beware, this is no where close to that CD"
4,4 1/2 stars.,"there's a line of thought that's been floated out there that big brother & the holding company were not up to par with the talent of janis joplin. bunk. while nobody is going to accuse them of possessing any amazing facile grace on their instruments, the fact remains that ms joplin made her most powerful music with these boys. CHEMISTY here trumps technique. big brother's raw sprawling sound perfectly compliments janis joplin's wild vocals. she sounds possessed by some spirit of liberation at times here, shrieking a juxtaposed answer to the musicians fury. her performance seems to draw an energy from the wicked sounds being produced around her. this entire album is a wild rock and roll ride, and a must for all collections. the work she produced after big brother & the holding company seems tame in comparison."
5,Thrills (cheap and otherwise),"Cheap Thrills is the ultimate time capsule of the psychedelic '60s. Big Brother and the Holding Company were completely ahead of their time, yet definitively OF their time. If you don't have this album in your collection, you are missing out on one of the great albums ever. So what are you waiting for?"
3,Horrible Remastering,"Did I miss something in reading the previous reviews? I just gotthis item and on first listen was greatly disappointed with thesound/mix quality or lack of for this classic album remaster.I also purchased the live Winterland CD and the sound on thatis spectacular. Not sure what happened with this one becausethe levels are low and the mix is tinny, muddy and seems tobe phased more to the right stereo channel. I'm surprisednobody else has experienced this for this release...maybe Ijust got a lemon copy???"
3,Janis Howls,"If you like Janis and want a definitive work of her time with Big Brother and the Holding Company, this is it! The CD has 4 bonus tracks of reasonable quality which were not on vinyl. Also worthwhile checking out Big Mama Thornton as a derivative for tracks like ""Ball and Chain"". If you liked ""Mercedes Benz"" which I think is rubbish, this CD is not for you."
4,Continuation of previous review,"Well, unfortunately, a reviewer of this CD has missed the entire point of Janis Joplin's singing style. I say, good for his dad for listening to a classic album, the #1 psychedelic album of all time in my book! And believe me, Manson, King, McLachlan, and Nicks know nothin' about the blues when compared to Blues Mama Janis!"
5,Cheap Thrills,"These are never like the old albums, but neither am I. The music is great just like I remember it. It was great hearing Janice sing her songs again."
5,J.Joplin & Big Brother and The holding Co.,"This is a remake of the only record I ever bought by Janice Joplin. She fronts the group and the musicians are collectively named ""Big Brother and The Holding Company"". (Seems like I saw all of them in the movie ""Woodstock"".) It's a rockin' album and done very well, well enough that I repeatedly update my collecton with it. I have the album, the cassette, and now the CD. I give it an A or A+ (but, you have to love this sound)."
5,My Favorite Album,"Cheep Thrills is my old man's favorite album, daddy! When Janice Joplin was with Big Brother & The Holding Company they were both at their best and it wasn't Janice. It was truly the whole band Big Brother not just Janice (tho she was stellar). The cd has bonus cuts on it which don't improve the album. In it's original layout it was just the coolest from the Crum comix on the jacket to the lineup of pure genius classics. Got it nice -n- cheep"
1,Uck,"I love the voices of Shirley Manson, Carole King, Sarah McLachlan, Stevie Nicks, and yet you rank Janis number ONE???? Her voice is so awful and it takes her a whole minute to go through one sentence on most of her songs, and she's probably a hick. This album wasn't good at all. My dad listens to it all the time, and I think the songs weren't thought out right and that they didn't fit together. and then, JANIS! Misewell put me in a rubber room if i have to listen to that God-awful voice. ARETHA FRANKLIN is a good voice, not JANIS."
5,Flashback to the 60's,"Seminal example of 60's ""acid rock"". Founded in blues, enhanced by personal artistry and interpretation and of course nuanced by illicit recreational drugs (the Ball and Chain guitar solo?). Janis Joplin at her finest."
3,Terrible audio on this recording...,"Nostalgia.Bought this CD of the vinyl, which I had many years ago.High end audio systems do not do this CD any favors. Hum, distortion - poor mic placement...and more.But it was fun to hear JJ again - even if it sounded like she was singing through a heavy vinyl shower curtain.Wonder why I thought the old BVD (black vinyl disc) was pretty good - way back then?"
4,Got Janis?,"I recently revisited this album (my edition pre-dates the bonus tracks, but even so), and I was pleased to find that it still hasn't really aged all that much, considering the material is nearly 40 years old (and in the case of ""Summertime"", considerably older!).The case could be made that Janis never really made what you would call a 'perfect' album. And although the critics at the time of its initial release hated Big Brother as the backing band, I have to say that they suited Janis' style perfectly. Not that they could work with any other performer, as Janis wasn't a strict ""blues"" singer, nor was she what you'd call ""polished"".""Combination Of The Two"", ""Summertime"", and ""Ball And Chain"" still sound great, even after all this time. Eschew the overpriced box sets and buy this album instead."
5,Janis' Best Work,"As Janis' first mainstream outing, I believe that this album is the finest of her career. You can feel the enthusiasm between the band personnel in the all out ""balls to the wall"" drive of the music.Done before the influence of the monied producers, you will hear a miracle. Artists doing what they love."
5,An angel with a dirty face,"Seeing Janis Joplin in concert on her best nights one could see that this being wasn't quite human. Despite her famous reputation of overindulgence in booze, sex and drugs Janis was in someway the closest thing we have seen to an angel in modern times.What can be said about Cheap Thrills that has not already been said? It is a classic and one of the best records of the 60s decade.Janis puts heart and soul in every one of these songs.But it is not all Janis that makes these songs what they are. The sometimes underrated Big Brother and the Holding Company truly has it s moments of brilliance on this album.Janis died young but left not only a musical legacy but a legacy to the human spirit.This album is a must have for any fan of modern music."
3,A remaster of a classic,"There is no question that Cheap Thrills is a classic. Enough has been written on the music, that I don't really have anything to add. I will say, that while the remastering has cleaned up the sound quite a bit, it has also taken some of the ""life"" and sparkle out of it. The original version has more energy and a ""rawness"" to it that adds to the feel of the music. The additional tracks don't really add much either. All in all, I prefer the original version."
3,"Fun, but repetitive","The first song on this cd sets the standard for the rest of the songs- it is fun, interesting, and a remarkable copy of the sound of the 80's. However, the rest of the songs on the cd sound just about the same, only a little less interesting, so it gets repetitive and difficult to listen to as a whole album."
4,needs more exposure,"i've seen these gals in concert, and they're great. only wish we could see more of them.management?"
1,"derivative and boring, no replay value","I have no idea why this band is even remotely popular, why not just listen to the Smiths and early Cure instead? this band doesnt even come close to touching the greatness of those early post-punk/new-wave bands. There is nothing original or daring about this release, and the songs aren't that great either, and all sound the same."
5,The Latest in Kovacevich's New Beethoven Piano Sonata Cycle,"Without question, Stephen Kovacevich's latest recording of Beethoven's piano sonatas makes a very compelling case for him as our foremost interpreter of Beethoven. Once he completes recording the entire cycle, his interpretations will undoubtedly be the new standard against which others shall be compared. His performances on all of these sonatas are filled with ample keyboard precision coupled with vibrant, dramatic playing. For example his performance of the ""Moonlight"" sonata is the most exhilirating I've heard, replete with much passion as well as grace. Kovacevich knows when to take off, playing loudly when the score demands it; conversely his soft, tranquil playing is easily the most serene I have heard from a noted contemporary interpreter of Beethoven, with the possible exception of Richard Goode. The sound quality of this CD is absolutely exemplary."
3,It's good but could be SO MUCH MORE,"I agree with the other gentleman who wrote about all of the omissions. She sang a full program that night and it's silly, in this day and age and with a person like Barbra, to not have the whole thing released, once and for all.They're releasing all the TV programs on 11/22/05; it will be interesting to see if it's just the truncated 55-minute CBS version, or if they've gone back and finally unearthed it all.Barbra admits (to Diane Sawyer) to forgetting the lyrics on three separate occasions that night, but at this point, what's the big deal? Could this be why we only get these abbreviated versions of the concert? But, if that's the reason, it's a rather silly one. I think that, given her place in show biz, it's more appropriate to just get it out there -- flaws and all -- so everyone can see what all the buzz was about way back in the day.C'mon, Barbra. C'mon, Columbia Records. Open up the vaults and give us all the real thing!"
2,Overpriced and VERY LATE,"I waited several weeks for this item--far longer than most Amazon orders--and when it finally arrived, I found the quality to be just average. Yes, you can sit on it--IF you are careful and IF you aren't too big--but it is not so sturdy the older versions of this hamper. To make matters worse, I saw the same hamper (albeit in white only) for $40 at Bed Bath and Beyond. So go to B,B & B and get a fair price for the hamper and also you won't have to stand in line so long as I had to wait at home!"
2,Returned item,"Not what I expected. Too small and the wicker would crack too easily if any weight was placed on top. A few pairs of jeans would fill the hamper. Not made like the ones I remember Mom buying at the local stores when growing up- they would take a lot of clothes, top was sturdy to sit on and took a lot of abuse from family. Will continue to look for one of those."
4,wolf inside my stomach,"Fascinating short novel by the winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature 1972. The protagonist is a young repairman in Germany just after WWII. A young man driven by fear of failure and a hunger. Disconnected and somewhat disoriented, he goes through the motions of interpersonal relationships but seems more an observer outside himself who cannot accept the results of his choices."
5,Gift for my son in Florida.,"It's hard to give a review, since this was a gift, but my son assures me he loves it. He can't wait to use it and he had specifically asked for this particular vest. He wants to use it to Kayack."
5,Easy and informative read,"this book covers everything to take charge of your female health issues! It is not bias towards any kind of teatments ....it just covers all the female health issues,the treatment options that are available and the facts ....very clearly!! I found this a very helpful guide to help make the best choice of treatment for myself... I highly recommend this book!"
4,"Use the force, Luke.","If this were a single disk--Derrick's--this would be a 5. DC does his typical banging house, mixed to the point where it dances on the edge of cacophony. And it's great, particularly the remix of 'Bushes,' which is one of the best pieces of house music around.Luke's disk isn't as virtuosically mixed, but it's solid. If I heard him at a club, I would have thought highly of his mixing skills. But the tunes are way deeper than I like 'em. By song 4 or 5, I'm always reaching for the Eject button, because I have to switch to something with a little more oomph before I drown in the murkiness.Worthwhile, still, especially because Classic puts out singles that blow away most of the ... that I have to flip through in the bins at local record stores."
3,Incomplete,"I've always liked the idea behind NASHVILLE SKYLINE, but thought it felt incomplete.Some of Dylan's most beautiful songs--""Girl From The North Country,"" ""Tell Me It Isn't True,"" ""Tonight I'll Be Staying Here With You""--are crippled by that voice (though it works to perfection on ""Lay Lady Lay""). Guest vocalist Johnny Cash sounds bored and confused.Worst of all, the total playing time of this CD is just over 27 minutes."
3,Okay Zimmy...,"I think that artist should be held to the standards that they set for themselves, rather than the standards that others set for them. Undoubtedly, Nashville Skyline is a really, REALLY good country album, & Dylan should be commended for that. But compared to Blonde On Blonde, Highway 61 Revisited, Bringing It All Back Home, Freewheelin', John Wesley Harding, Blood On the Tracks, Time Out of Mind, Desire.....even Empire Burlesque or Oh Mercy, Nashville Skyline is mediocre, & Dylan should be held accountable for that. He has shown himself capable both before & after of producing work far superior to that of Nashville Skyline, & instead of commending him for his undoubtedly great work on this album, we should say, ""Okay Zimmy, great job, but we know you can do much better."""
5,that rare thing: a perfect album,"I could listen to this album over and over again. I know this because I've done it. I couldn't tell you what it is, exactly. I love Bob Dylan, but then, this is an anomalous Dylan album. Somehow the album and all the songs on it are just right."
1,Dylan's Worst Albumn,"Dylan's Nashville Skyline is simply disasterous. It contains boring melodies, unoriginal lyrics, and Dylan for the first time sounding unintentionally commercial but commercial. The lyrics are trhe main problem. Going from the lyrics of Desolation Row and It's Alright, Ma to Lay, Lady, Lay and Country Pie is not a very good idea."
4,Dylan Goes Country,"I like the country effect on this Nashville Skyline release. Bob Dylan actually sings on this album(as opposed to the usual grumble) and quite well I might add. A nice blend of ballads, shuffles, and country rockers. The duet with Johnny Cash is beautiful although I tend to prefer Country Pie and To Be Alone With You.I will admit there is a littel less substance on this release than on prior Dylan tunes. Blonde On Blonde has more poetry than this batch. In addition, the songs are a little bit too short here. Heck, the whole album is under a half hour. None the less, Dylan's vocal tone and ligh hearted attitude makes it a fun listen for me."
3,Are You Ready For The Country?,"Here, Dylan sheds any remaining pressure of the 'generation spokesman' title and really just tries to let it be known that he's in it to be an entertainer, not a social commentator. Unfortunately, his songwriting loses a little edge in the process, and his singing voice switches from his sharp breathy howl to a soothing country croon that may alienate some listeners (you can't even tell it's Dylan singing, the voice he unveiled here is so different). But regardless, as far as folksy country-rockers go, he's one of the best! A duet with Johny Cash proves he's not joking, although this album is one-of-a-kind in Dylan's catalogue. He went back to folk rock after this."
5,Car Joy!,"This album has shuttled me through many long journeys with not a little uplifting joy. These are the songs that were just good music, not music of the 'icon.' They are not 'trying' to do anything, for the world or the social attitude. They just bring some winsome taste of pleasure, and seem to have a good time doing it. The Johnny Cash duet, is unforgettable, every time.If you don't know all the words, you haven't been saturated and still have many miles to go. As for sexy- ""Tonight I'll be Staying Here With You"" is this old gal's penultimate troubadour song. It's how Dylan can never get too old for seduction- too bad, he's not so sure of that himself! Have some fun, and reacquaint yourself with slamming melodies and the one and only- in an interlude of music, just plain good music."
3,pretty but slips!,"My 5 year old wore this with her beautiful Bride outfit on Halloween and continues to play princess with it. It is very pretty and durable. However, it is very hard to keep it on without bobby pins or other help, which did not go over well with us!"
5,Urdu Grammar-Barker,"This book set is considered by professional teachers in the field to be the ultimate Grammar written on the Urdu language. Urdu grammar is straightforward yet difficult to define in a comprehensive way as it has never been attempted in a linguistic fashion, as has been done for the Arabic language in English by Peter Abboud's outstanding ""Elementary Modern Standard Arabic"", Cambridge Publishers. So, if you want to understand the structure of the Urdu language, this is the book!"
3,Doesn't fit my magazine...,"seems like it would be a great product but it's a little too short for a pk380 mag. Otherwise, it would have a 5 star review"
4,Great information,"Great information, although I wish it included a CD or a website where you could download all the forms for free."
5,Has everything you need to know,"This book was an excellent investment. It's a bit wordy, but it has a ton of information for landlords. As a first-time landlord, it provided me with perspectives I would have never considered."
2,delivery timing/costs issue,Book was for gift. Book in fine condition but not impressed with speed of delivery especially after upgrading on the delivery options and being quoted end of December delivery. didn't arrive until mid Jan. Not sure how to go about reclaiming the extra cost paid to speed up the delivery which never happened...any suggestions welcome.
4,NEOPHYTES EVERYWHERE,This helped me a lot as a inexperienced landlord. It is very informative and will touch all areas of the business that you would never think of. Experience does not have to be the best teacher.
4,"It fits, it works.","What can I say- it's a replacement lamp for the bug trap.It fits. It works. It's not hard to install.It's a little bit spendy for what you get, but hey, it works.No more mosquitoes in my screenporch. :-)"
4,Good cheap bar,"There are several things i like about the ea30 bar from easton. It is incredibly light and the anatomic bend is nice in the drops. however, I think i would've preferred a 46 cm as opposed to the 40 cm i got, but that's certainly not easton's fault. overall a good cheap handlebar. we'll just see if it lasts as i'm hard on my toys."
4,Marvelous appeal to children,"Charming, enlightning, marvelous illustrations!!! That pup Blueberry is a warming story about a little boy and his pup. Illustrations really tell the story of a great friendship. A must read for all ages!!"
3,Mostly fun,"I bought this for my 5 year old son and he enjoys it but it is kind of quirky in the way the games go. There is no indicator of how long you have to play until you get the clue. Still, he does enjoy it and maybe I am the one that wants to know how long to play each game."
1,Not very happy with this game,"I purchased this game for my in home day care children. The preschoolers love Scooby Do so I wanted to give them some computer time and fun. They were extremely excited to see I had a Scooby Do game. As they began playing it they lost interest quite quickly. It was not easy, challenging nor fun. It seems a bit more for older age children yet too repetitious to hold interest. Was not happy with this purchase."
2,"Good Concept, Bad Delivery","Our boys love all things Lego, and really love the puzzle book series from Usborne, so we had great hopes for this book. However, we were all sorely disappointed. Even for our 4 year old, the so-called ""puzzles"" were hardly challenging - maybe 4 or 5 of the 14. Take a look at ""Puzzle Castle (Usborne Young Puzzle Books)"" or ""Puzzle Jungle (Usborne Young Puzzle Books)"" instead - you'll be glad you did!"
2,Vac 'N Blo Vacuum,"This appliance lacks several common items one would expect and should find in a vacuum costing this amount. For example, the cord is only about eighteen inches long and the tank is round and is unstable without feet or a flat spot on its bottom to keep it upright when you set it in place. And, the hose is ridiculously short. I added about a fifteen foot cord and intend to add feet to make it stable. I also used a hose from a vacuum I purchased previously. Power is decent is no more so than much less expensive vacuums commonly available at discount stores. I wouldn't recommend purchase at half its cost."
5,excellent coffee,"I have not tried this specific item. Although I have had Caffe del Doge espresso and it is great. There are two locations in downtown Palo Alto Ca, in case you'd like to try the coffee before making the amazon purchase.419 University and 95 University Palo Alto, one on the streets downtown and the other at the Palo alto train station."
3,"This book was ok, but it lacked some of Angela's thoughts.","This book was mediocre. I was disappointed ( I absolutely loved the show) because the book was missing some of Angela's thoughts and actions from the tv-show. The book did not fully explain all of the events as the show did, and because of this some famous lines and thoughts were missing. Overall, the book was an ok read, but I enjoyed the show much better because it was so interesting and thought provoking to see (and hear) what Angela was doing and thinking...especially about Jordan Catalano!=)"
4,"if you loved the show, this is a must-read","Catherine Clark does a good job writing this story in the voice of Angela, and incorporating the most memorable episodes from the series. There is also a note from Winnie Holzman (sp?), praise of the show from viewers, and bios of the actors in the back."
2,WHAT 8 pages of color photos?,"I bought this book because the ""eight pages of color photos"" were mentioned in NUMEROUS reviews.Imagine my dismay when I received the book and found the only pics it has are the one on the front cover,and a few tiny ones on the back cover.NONE inside! So be forewarned-buy this only for the text,NOT for pictures!"
3,My Unreal Life,"Angela's life and friends are very unrealistic (no way in anyone's life would she have got near Jordan Catalano) but anyone who liked the original series, or anyone who missed it (as I did) and wanted to remember / find out the intricacies of her feelings will like this book. However, don't expect anything new, or even half the detail of the original series."
5,Very HAndy,I purchased this set for when baby comes home in August and I have already used it several times. The ear thermometer can be switched from Fahrenheit to Celsius which is terific since I am in Europe. The case it Very sturdy and every themometer fits well.
1,5 Thermometers and 50 different readings?,I agree completely with the review that gave product 1 star also. My temp reading for the ear thermometer ran between 96.5 and 102 within ten minutes. The other thermometers all flunked as well. If you decide to use product do so at your little ones health. Bottom line....READINGS CANNOT BE TRUSTED!!!!!!!!!
1,THESE DO NOT WORK!!,"I registered for this and it DOES NOT WORK!! I tried several of the thermometers for my two month old and none of them are accurate. We also tried a couple on ourselves, and they didn't work either!"
1,Not happy,"I don't have this whole kit, but I do have one of these that came in another baby kit and I have decided to trash it. It has never given an accurate reading from day one (I ahve a 20 month old and another on the way). I went and bought a grocery store brand digital that works much better than this one. My advice, don't spend the money, it's not worth it!!"
2,Not the best album of the 60s by a long shot.,"Sure, this recording sounds about as good as you will ever hear it, but the music on it is certainly an acquired taste. If I remember correctly, I bought this album when it first came out, listened to it once then gave it away. I was curious to learn if my musical tastes had become more tolerant over the past 45 years but they, apparently, haven't."
5,Best air freshener on the market,"I have used this product for years and have found none better. It truly does not mask odors, but absorbs them and leaves the air as fresh as when I squeeze fresh orange juice. Glad Amazon carries it because it isn't easy to find except through the manufacturer."
1,Too much hassle to order this direct from the Distributor,"O K if you get it from Amazon. Don't order direct from the distributor (Beaumont Products) inaccurate shipping ... and NO customer service. I have since found FEBREZE is better, easily available at the grocery store ... get it when I want it ... no hassle."
5,Best air freshener ever!,"Not too over powering, last a long time, don't need to spray much.It's a fresh orange scent, very soothing."
2,it is too strong,"You can only spray just a little otherwise it is too strong. Not used to that. Since strong scent gives me headaches, and irritates me. You can say am allergic to strong scent just like this one."
3,Only some of Bester's best,"Maybe, to my taste, Alfred Bester was better at book length (The Stars My Destination, Golem 100, The Demolished Man (an all-time favorite of mine)) than at short stories. Most of the stories here left me a bit cold except , of course, for ""The Pi Man"", Bester's best short story. In fact, unfortunately, I found many of them to be rewrites of the same concept - a cross between ""be careful what you wish for"", and ""absolute power always goes wrong."""
3,Mixed experimental bag with one overworked classic and one standout surprise masterpiece,"Okay, here it is in a walnut shell... If you loved Fondly Fahrenheit then you'll love these stories. A lot of experimental writing here.If... on the other hand, you like your stories with character, plot and other timeworn and antiquated devices, then, with one startling exception, this will not be for you.The knock you out of your chair surprise masterpiece here? ""They Don't Make Life Like They Used To"" It has everything: humor, romance, freshness, style and an ending that chills and moves as the same time.The story is online and can be read for free. However you read it, do read it."
2,Much of his short fiction is disappointingly pedestrian.,"There are some gems here, notably ""Fondly Farenheit"" and the previously unpublished ""The Devil Without Glasses"", but most of the short stories are decidedly second-rate. ""Galatea Galante"" is a clumsy Heinlein pastiche. ""They Don't Make Life Like They Used To"" is the sort of leaden ""whimsy"" which has plagued Fantasy & Science Fiction for the last half century. And several of the stories from the early 50's are thinly veiled diatribes against the paucity of original thought in ""classic"" science fiction. (Bester makes the wholly convincing argument that most of genre is little more than adolescent power fantasies, but fails to provide stories that provide a meaningful counterpoint.)Stick to the novels - THE STARS MY DESTINATION and THE DEMOLISHED MAN, Bester's best work."
3,"Good writing, poorly presented","The nice thing about this book is that it's pretty much the only way to get a good chunk of Bester's short fiction collected in one place. That said, the book itself suffers from serious problems. It seems that some time after the last copy editor looked it over, someone in the production process changed the book's type font. Since several of Bester's stories involve playful typesetting and/or characters that are outside the (current) normal set of symbols, a great deal of flavor was lost. One-quarter or one-half fractions replaced by square boxes, that type of thing. Too bad, because the publishers were obviously aiming for a product that you'd call nicer than the usual mass-market paperback. The screwy typeface errors mar that considerably."
3,A nice nostalgia trip for us old guys . . .,"Bester is one of those science fiction mainstays whom everyone of a certain age read back in the '50s and '60s, and who is almost totally unknown to younger readers who were raised on the Cyberpunks. But I have to admit that the settings and language and cultural furniture of most of these stories haven't worn very well, unlike the work of Heinlein or Clarke -- or even Bester's own classic novels, _The Demolished Man_ and _The Stars My Destination._ The ""messages"" in most of these pieces are also pretty trite, but that was never the point of reading Bester anyway. The man was a master of oddball style, eerie description, and droll dialogue, and you can have a really good time chuckling your way through ""Will You Wait?"" or appreciating the chill of ""Fondly Fahrenheit,"" or picking out all the references in ""The Flowered Thundermug."""
3,Not memorable; read his early novels instead,"Skewed, yet cliched, best describes the visions Bester unveils in these collected short stories. His characters inhabit worlds that are subtly perverse variants of the ""Father Knows Best"" 1950s mythology, and his tales typically end with a final sentence straight out of the ""Twilight Zone."" In fact, as I read the stories I was constantly reminded of Twilight Zone writer Charles Beaumont and his (better) collected short stories, The Howling Man. Bester's prose, laced with irony and sardonic humor, is often very fresh and almost contemporary, yet many of his themes are of the time in which they were written. Most unfortunately, the stories simply are not memorable. They make a light impression on the mind, engender a few chuckles or a furrowed brow, and then fade away.My advice--read The Demolished Man, twice, and then read The Stars My Destination, twice. That's all the Bester you need."
2,Disappointing. Not recommended,"I feel a bit ripped off with this one. It doesn't explain how to to do a simple IVR system like I wanted. A lot of the code just plain doesn't work (at least under VB5), a number of the examples require a C++ compiler, or require you to buy additional custom controls. One of the archives on the CD is faulty and won't decompress. SAMs had no answer - they said the book was 'too old' (2 years!) No response whatsoever from the author Amundsen."
2,Not recommended for advanced users because ...,"This book is not as much useful as it claims.(No useful example with API functions, all it has is using OCX)"
1,don't buy this book,"This book did not solve my problems. On the one hand, there is a lot of VB stuff. I wanted to learn how to implement a telephony server with TAPI, but as I said: without success.There are no practical things in this book, no useful examples, and the rest is not worth the money I payed. Even the MSDN is better..."
2,You can get this book on line for free,The book did not solve many of my problems (eg sending a wave file to a line)...
2,Leans heavily on the use of high end commercial toolkits,"This type of programming is currently at a premium. Good reference material is very difficult to find. I bought and read this book. Personally, I am still looking for a book includes code that doesn't rely on $500 per licence ActiveX controls. Also, web links and other materials are extremely dated."
2,Very Average,"Sample code is an odd mixture of VB and C++. Most of the advanced samples are only in VB.Does not go in-depth enough about TAPI or MAPI ( can't speak for SAPI ).Would have been better covering DAPI than SAPI as it is an API that ties in nicely with MAPI, TAPI and Exchange development and after all, who uses SAPI ??"
2,Very cheap and flimsy,"These National Brand steno books are made of very cheap paper and backing boards. It's impossible to use them the way steno books are meant to be used --ie, writing on them while holding the pad in your lap. These are only marginally ok if you use them writing flat on a table. Paper is rough and cheap, not smooth at all. (If you're looking for a steno pad with a rigid backing, be sure the description says ""easel backing"" that allows it to stand upright.) Sorry I bought these, waste of money."
4,A Bit More Flexible Than I Wanted...,"I purchased this scraper, not to clean out bowls, but to remove dough from a wooden pastry board that my husband crafted. Because this scraper is a bit more flexible than the Tovolo, it does not do a good job removing stuck-down dough. Thus, I'm giving it four stars rather than five. However, it does do a fine job when using it to turn ciabatta dough that is quite wet and does work well to scrape the inside of a mixing bowl. If that had been my original purpose in purchasing this scraper, it would have rated five stars."
2,Too flexible,"This scraper was too flexible for scraping bread dough from the bowl. I guess it would work fine on lighter dough, like for cakes. The shape of the scraper is ideal for round bowls. I bought one from Sur La Table that looked the same but was much more rigid and it worked fine. I will have to recycle this one for other uses or to someone who doesn't need it for bread dough."
5,one of few original metalcore bands,Not only is btbam's music incredibly unique but they have a talent that practically all of their peers lack: lyrics. Their lyrics are actually well written. You wont find any moronic sworn enemy lyrics here. One of the greatest things about their music is how varied it is. They can go from death metal to clean melodies and then a breakdown before you even realize it. They put the other victory bands to shame.
5,Fantastic,"This album is fantastic. Extremely well-written, technical music. Everything about Between the Buried and Me is incredible. Paul Waggoner is my guitar idol."
5,NOT FOR THE MATHEMATICALLY CHALLENGED!,"This band has not only challenged hardcore and metal-core fans, but music fans in general. It may take a couple of spins, but this band will be one of your favorites."
5,Un Ef-ing Real,"Probably one of the most incredible bands at blending just about every musical ingredient one could imagine. Metal, hardcore, melody, rock, blood, sweat, tears, skin, teeth, hair fragments, pain, agony, sorrow, inner stomach lining, this is truly inspiring and creative music. So creative in fact, it might actually be extremely difficult for those super-smart, black-clothed, city-fok-intellectuals to swallow. Yes, I am a fan and that is why this review is glowing. However, if you really are interested in a group of cats really pushing limits, check these lords out.Imagine yourself, Tanya Harding, Bruce Lee, The Dali Lama, Jim Neighbors, myself and the buried souls of yesterday super-saturating your mind. That's about as obscure as I can get but that's about as amazing as this BTBM blended shake gets."
4,From the Synoptic Problem to the Historical Jesus,"Reddish begins with a discussion of the formation of the Gospels, a discussion which must inevitably deal with the Synoptic Problem and John's relationship to the Synoptics. From there he goes on to explore the world of the Evangelists, and then he presents a chapter on each Gospel. The individual Gospel chapters discuss the social settings and major themes of the Gospels, and give both an outline and a reading guide to the Gospels.After dealing with the Canonical Gospels, Reddish considers the apocryphal/pseudepigraphical gospels, giving a description of each and discussing its relationship, if any, to the canonical Gospels. Finally, Reddish turns to the Quest for the Historical Jesus, setting out and discussing in detail the scholarly criteria for determining historicity of the various Gospel accounts.This slender volume has more breadth than depth, but it claims to be no more than an introduction to Gospel study. It serves that purpose well."
5,This is my favorite body powder!,"I love a body powder, especially on a hot day. But the one thing I hate about body powder is the cloud of it in the air and that I always end up with the taste of it in my mouth. With Honey Dust, this isn't a problem. Yes, there is a small cloud of it around you but what's different is that it is sweet tasting, not chalky. It comes with a great feather duster that feels good. It doesn't clump up in the ""niches"" of your body. The scent is very soft and does not interfere with your perfume."
3,Not quite what I was expecting.,"It's a little bitter. I was expecting more of a sweet flavor. Maybe it will grow on me, but the bitterness makes me not want to use it. Sad for how much it cost."
3,"Smells nice and is kinda fun, but does create a powdery mess!","I purchased this for my husband for Christmas a few years back and we still have some remaining because to be honest we don't use it all that often. It's nice and relaxing to have someone apply powder to you with a feather applicator. However, my husband and I enjoy massaging each other with massage oils even more so than this. The other downside to this is that the powder gets all over the sheets LOL. Anyhow, it does smell nice and tastes OK too but I don't really know why anybody would want to eat it or lick it off another persons body ;-)"
5,awesome product!!,"I purchased this product for the second time, the first was honeysuckle which I really loved. This time I picked up the chocolate flavored for a friends birthday gift. Although I didn't have the pleasure of checking it out myself, my friend is a chocolate nut and she loved it!!"
3,same...,"Like I did the other 1, this is pretty much to consider. It isn't a bad album anyway I still own all of those on LP (both MMMMitch! and MORE SING-ALONG W/ MITCH)Surely love the vocals 2 this one and also good orchestral work also."
3,Start of the post apocalyptic saga,"This series of novels brings the world of a post apocalyptic hero. If you enjoyed the Mad Max movies, you will enjoy this series. It starts with this book."
3,Wrong Dimensions,Descriptions said: 11 x 8.8 x 7.3 inchesWhat arrived was: 12 x 11 x 5.5 inches.Otherwise... it would be good. If it fit in my terrarium.
4,This lady was a gift from God!,When I first heard Janis sing Little Girl Blue I was frozen by its emotive power. I still feel the same way 23 years later. Listening to Kosmic Blues is incredible today. Janis gave so much more than most singers do. Thank God this got recorded.
5,ROUGH AND DRAMATIC,"My favorite tape of my favorite female singer!What I like in Janis is her roughness and her ""bluesiness"", and of her three recordings this is surely the one which best conveys them to the listener. Cause ""Cheap Thrills"" is even rougher, but is musically weaker, while ""Pearl"", is too ""POP"", and Janis seems to hold back the power of her voice there.Even though some critics didn't like ""Kozmic Blues"" for the presence of the horns, I find that they add perfectly to the dramaticity of Janis's voice and of the songs themselves.You can hear her soul cry through the blues of this songs!The extra-tracks also are very good, and are in tone with the rest of the songs."
5,mike bloomfield,"i got this for ""one good man"" because mike bloomfield tears it up on guitar.its worth the price alone.it turns out that i like the whole cd."
4,This pertains to the re-issue!,"Well, the original album still rates 5 stars, but the bonus tracks knock a star off. ""Dear Landlord"" isn't very good and gets old fast. ""Summertime"" and ""Piece of My Heart"" are welcome from Woodstock, but certain instruments (primarily the excellent organ work) are toned down and hardly hearable. That itself warrants 4 stars only. This is still her best album, though!!!"
3,janis tries aretha - big misstep!!!,"the reason that big brother and holding company worked is because the snarling twin lead guitars laden with fuzz and distortion perfectly matched the gravelly grit of janis's voice.if you take the guitars out of the equation, it kind of tames down janis. it is like trying to make a kitten out of a tigress."
4,Work Fine,"I've used these a number of times on my '76 Ford F-250 and they've done well. I've had them on while going about 40 mph with 3500lbs of weight on them and there's no sign of any problems. It can be real tough to hook and unhook the chains, but I don't blame the design on that. It's just an inherently tricky thing to do with gloves on and snow everywhere. If only I could put the chains on in the middle of summer like in their demo video instead of when I'm hip-deep in snow and it's five degrees out."
3,OK,Pretty light duty--was expecting something a little appropriate for a 1-ton truck so I don't expect much life. At least they were the right size.
4,good quality,"The quality of the tire chains seems to be good, and the added traction is excellent. Don't ever let anyone tell you that putting chains on is clean and easy, you'll always need to get dirty puttin them on. But when you need chains, you NEED chains, and these ones will get the job done for you."
4,One Of The Great Overlooked Albums,"Sisyphus, that is. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because there is a weird digital glitch at the beginning of ""Your Good Thing""-Rhino should have destroyed this batch and redid them, but that would have cost $$. The sound is B+, and much better than my LP, still in good shape. Plus you get two for one. Trivia: Both these albums were originally on the San Francisco label, started by impressario Bill Graham."
4,SUPER SOUL!!,"i remember hearing about this band WAY back when, by more than one person, but i was never in the right place, right time, or 'frame of mind'; i suppose!! TOO BAD!! -now that i'm a 'stupid OLD man', instead of a stupid YOUNG man'; FINALLY catching up with them!!...i can say this!!; just FABULOUS!!!!-i got downloads of the first album as well as 'sisyphus' (2nd) and burned them to CD. -REALLY GREAT EVERYTHING!!! singing: LYDIA PENSE!!! HORNS: GREAT, GOOD ARRANGEMENTS!! BASS: FABULOUS!! DRUMS: FABULOUS!! good guitar -GOOD SONGS!! these two albums 'smack' of 60's soul music, but go way beyond that, dialing in a good bit of blues; and even a 'tad' of psychedelia!! DELIGHTFULLY FUNKY!! -a MUST HAVE!! (would LOVE to see some film footage!!!, but it apparently doesn't exist!!)"
2,Not as good as First Taste of Sin,"This is Cold Blood without Donny Hathaway. It still has Lydia's powerful vocals, rockin' horn arrangements, but uneven performance. Very interesting if you're a Cold Blood fan and great if you just rip the songs you like. More of a raw, unpolished, live side of Cold Blood compared to First Taste of Sin."
2,Not easy. Very little instruction,This book gives very little instruction. It doesn't show you a step by step of how to prepare the decorations on the cake.
3,cute book,Very cute book. Lots of colorful cakes but definitely for very young children. Don't know that i'd recommend it for a beginner either.
4,I AM the Beginner!,"I have now made two of the cakes in this book. The parking garage was my first and I must say it was quite the challenge. I then made the snake pit, which was sooo much easier plus my 7 year old grandson had a blast helping make the snakes and placing them on the cake. Neither of my cakes look nearly as professional as Debbie's, but who cares? I'm not in this to be a professional myself, plus everyone who sees these are totally impressed with my creative talents - they just don't ever get to see Debbie's cakes!"
3,confusing directions,"This book is good for the pictures and ideas. It gives you specific directions on how to make the fondant or 'sugar paste' into the object or character for the cake you choose. But...it is European so we can't find some of the ingredients they ask for. Also, the cake that the recipe in the book makes doesn't taste good at all!"
4,Great book!,"Every cake in this book is full of wonderful ideas. The instructions are a little vague, but it does have a few sample pictures that help. I don't believe it would help someone just beginning in cake decorating, but if you have any experience it is easy to figure out with the instructions given. Absolutely adorable cakes."
5,Finally something new!,I have been decorating caked for over 40 years so I find it hard to think up new designs. It was great to see so many original yet not difficult decorating ideas.
4,50 Easy Party Cakes---for young children,"I enjoy Debbie Brown's cakes and looked forward to obtaining this one. It has a lot of whimsical cakes but I was a little disappointed. Most of the cakes are for very young children and I had hoped for more cakes that could be used for any age. That said, the cakes in this book are a bit easier than in some of her other books. Anyone with a little knowledge of fondant should be able to easily make them. They are all in fondant so if you do not like to work with it I would not recommend this book. As usual, the instructions are generally clear and with sufficient pictures. Although I was disappointed, it was solely because of the age factor. It is an excellent book and, if you are looking for a lot of great ideas for cakes for young children, I would highly recommend it. The star off is solely for not making it clearer that it is a book for young children."
4,Cute cakes for the children.,"This is another great cake book by Debbie Brown. I've been reading reviews by other people. One thing you need to know is that all of Debbie Brown's cakes are 3D. Made with a cake base and fondant over the top to give a full 180 to 360 degree view. If you want conventional looking 2D cakes, then her books are not for you. You do need a bit of patience and creativity to make the cakes, but well worth the effort when you see the kids faces light up. That's what I enjoy the most.Out of all her books, this would be the best starting point for beginners.I've made many of her cakes for the whole family and would highly recommend them all."
4,Brilliant Ideas for Party Cakes,"As a professional cake decorator and designer, I found this book unbelievable helpful with fresh ideas for both the novice and the experienced cake decorator. The price, the best anywhere around!"
5,Great beginners book,"I love the way Debbie Brown gives specific, clear instructions. It makes starting out in the cake - decorating world much easier. She guides you step by step to create elaborate looking cakes in an easy and efficient way.Mind you, the cake recipes are good if you like this type of cakes. Madeira cakes are pretty ""heavy"" and dense, which is great for sculpting etc' but not everybody likes their texture. You could use other sponge cake recipes, as long as the cake is stable enough to carry the weight of the rolled fondant.This was my first ever decorating book, and I love to browse through it to get ideas and refresh my skills from time to time."
3,Cute cakes...but...,"I ordered this book and decided to return it after looking through it. When ordering it I didn't realize that just about every cake is fondant. I've worked with fondant before and although it is beautiful, isn't a cake meant to eat?? Fondant is absolutely horrible tasting. I prefer something that actually tastes good. Don't get me wrong though, the cakes are cute, just not for me. :-)"
5,Super Simple and Super Cute,"I love this book. It has some really simple, but yet creative and great cakes in it. I'm excited to start at the beginning and try each of them. Debbie does a great job at explaining step by step the process to create each of her masterpieces and has pictures to go along with it. I love her creations and glad I purchased this book."
3,It's OK ~,"I was expecting a lot more. I have never used it because it is basically a book for professionals . It gives very little instruction on how to actually make the cakes. You get A page with A picture on it then the fallowing page may have another two to three pictures of ""stage 1-2-and/or 3"" It gives very little detail on how to get there. So I used the book as a dream book. I dream to one day know how to make these cakes.This book is for those who already know how to make them .A very personal note : Every time I make a cutesy cake or cup cakes like these No One eats them or cuts into them and they end up getting thrown away because they are TOO cute and don't look like they are to be eaten.I've had my heart broken now over 8 times and I have no intention on spending my money or time on them again. From now on it's Betty Crocker yellow cake with chocolate icing ."
1,I did not like the paperback form of this book - I like hardcopy - the price was too high and it took a long time for me to get,"The information in the book is great; but what I do not like is the paperback covering of the book; the hardcopy covering is much better and looks great. I order this book for a gift to Newly Weds; but it looks to cheap that I do not want to give it as a gift...Also, it took so long to get this produc in the mail; not sure what was the hold up."
5,Dino Encyclopedia,"Really folks... there are new and used copies available, at the time of this writing, for 1-3 dollars....unbelievable.Book is frankly an encyclopedia. Filled with entertaining illustrations that make even the disinterested want to read what they have to say about them. Any kid in the dinosaur phase will LOVE this one.The real qualm I have is that it's printed on paperback quality paper, so the paper will yellow with age.Additionally.. the all black line illustrations is up for grabs. On the one hand it seems cheap of them, then again... what do we REALLY know about the colors of Dinosaurs anyway???And they ARE entertaining to look at.I'd give this one 4 and a half stars."
5,EVERYTHING'S FINE,"I was somewhat apprehensive when I read all of the horror stories about the DVD MOVIE CASES that arived in damaged condition. But I needed them so I placed my order through Amazon seller, STAR TECH. They have a user rateing of 99% and yet when I added in their shipping cost their price was in line with the others. My order arrived quickly (Coast to Coast) and was in a thick cardboard box. When I opened it I found another thick cardboard box. The 100 cases inside were in four separate, nicely wrapped packages. All cases are in very fine shape. The lesson, if you haven't already learned it, is to always use the ""Seller Rateing"" to help you decide with which seller you should place your order. The lowest price won't do you much good if your order never arrives. Oh, I know that Amazon will probably stand behind you, but who needs the aggrevation?"
4,Good price,I know some people said a few of their cases came damaged but I did not have that issue. Pretty nice case and you can't beat the price. I will be buying more.
3,Sufficient,"These are sufficient and cheap DVD cases. I'd made the mistake of putting all my DVDs into jewel cases a few years ago to reduce space, however it made things impossible to find. These new cases have fixed the problem."
2,Cases Broken,When I received the package it was just a box with the cases. There was no protective packaging to prevent the cases from breaking. Now I have 20 cased that I cannot use due to them being broken beyond use. The others have worked perfectly.
5,"Awsome Product!! Super Cheap, But Flimsy As Expected","Super Cheap, But Flimsy As Expected. I have bought thousands of these ""Cheap and Flimsy"" DVD Cased for years, but hey, you get what you pay for!! Good for price...."
4,Fast Delivery,The product itself was decent. Most of the cases had no major defects. I had about 5-6 cases where the plastic DVD cover wasn't sealed properly but nothing too extreme that would prevent me from using the case.The saving grace was delivery. Very fast. Took a mere 3 days to receive the box! My last 100 case order from another vendor took 8 business days. 4/5 for a usable product and great delivery.
3,Good Value,"These DVD cases aren't Hollywood movie quality, but are much better than you see on a bootleg at a street market. I'm on my second box of 100 and I haven't found any broken or damaged cases . You can occasionally buy these on Amazon with free shipping. Free shipping makes these covers a huge bargain. Go price a package of 10 at your local business supply store.I have noticed the clear plastic used on the case covers, although smooth and unwrinkled, is appreciably thinner than the higher price brands and it is 2-3 mm too short at the top. I'm just trying to organize DVDs made from our collection of home video tapes, so these shortcomings don't really bother me. But if you're trying to fit a copy of a Hollywood DVD cover into your case containing your bootleg copy of a DVD, invest in a good paper cutter."
2,Not the deal you think,"I had ordered something ""like"" these prior and in the reviews people discussed having some broken items. Well I thought I would try these ones out as they were the same price and the seller describes them as being premium ect. Well My first order arrived ""other place"" and I was pretty surprised by what I got, they were excellent. Then I received these. Probably about a third were broken as many have reviewed, and the quality was just horrible. The plastic covering is the cheesiest thing Iv probably ever seen. The cases are very fragile so there is NOTHING premium about these. When alot of them are broken on arrival then the deal becomes a rip off."
2,Cases,"Cases Came in great time but the problem was 15% of them were broken, Most likely from the shipping company"
1,Bad DVD cases from the get go,These DVD cases were bad. Over half wouldn't stay closed due to the little hinge would break off when you opened the case the first time and wouldn't stay shut when you closed it. If it were a few I would have just took the loss. I sent them back for a refund.
1,Beware: THESE CASES ARE CRAP!,They are super flimsy and brittle. They fall apart easily. I have a bunch of broken cases and wanted to replace them. Yes these are cheap but you get what you pay for. They also smell funky.
1,Not Premium,"Don't be fooled by the term, ""Premium."" The cases I received are no different than standard poor quality DVD cases."
3,dvd cases,"they work perfectly for anyone looking to protect their dvd's instead of using file folder. Out of the 100 i ordered,Ive used 50 and 6 were broken too much too use. the center holder was only half there in a couple and in the other four would not close because the sides were not connected to the actual dvd cases. overall i'm okay with the purchase except for the broken cases, as i have not used the other 50 I do not know if they may, or may not be intact/usable."
4,good economical case.,These case are a good quality for the price. They are perfect for promos or copies of your work. I would recommend.
1,"Very poorly made, most arrived broken","I thought this was a great deal for 100 cases, but out of 100 I'm left with less than 60 that arn't damaged. The cases that arn't damaged are still very poor quality, and smell funny. The edges of the case are very rigid and sharp, not smooth like a typical case. The center hub does not hold discs very well, many cases do not close properly, and the plastic liner is very thin and easily rips. These cases are ""OKAY"" as a replacement, but if you're a reseller I would avoid these for your customers."
3,plastic is smells and cheap made,"These are made of some plastic that smells quite strong, and the CD locking center part is cheap & a little loose not as good as generic store brands like office depot or similar. They need to remove the ""premium"" out of the description, again they are made ""ok"" but not premium for sure..."
2,Poor Packaging,"I wish that I read the reviews before purchasing this product.All of the cases are very fragile/rigid plastic, so half of them were crushed on the way here.Also, the clear plastic feels very cheap and isn't as glossy as most are."
5,Excellant Value!,"I have bought these cases on two different occasions months apart. I can say that both times I was very pleased. There were 1 or 2 damaged cases in the first box of 100. They were on the corner of the box and MAY have been damaged during shipping. The second shipment was perfect. While these are a little thinner than some other cases available, they are fine for everyday use. The cost per cases is an excellant value, too. Standard label inserts fit nicely. They hold the discs securely. What more could anyone want? This a a great deal!"
2,bad batch?,I purchased these cases and found on at least 1/4th of them the vinyl film insert peice on the front would tear off when sliding the insert in. Another 6 were cracked. I will probably not buy from this seller again.
4,Good utility quality cases,My box of 100 arrived in good condition. My spot check has turned up no damaged cases (something some other reviewers complained of). The cases are exactly as described. Quality seems fine but not heavy duty. Definitely happy with this purchase.
5,Product as described,"They aren't super high-quality, but for the price it will get the job done. Packaging and condition upon arrival were acceptable."
1,NOT PREMIUM AT ALL,"THE PRODUCT THAT I RECEIVE WAS FRAGILE BROCKEN BOXES, BUYERS BEWARE!!NOT PREMIUM QUALITY. WHEN I RECEIVE THE BOX, THE MAJORITY OF THE BOXES WHEREBROKEN, THE PLASTIC WAS VERY CHEAP"
2,Perfect for the price EXCEPT the BAD ODOR!,"I was very excited to find these for the price with a plus of free shipping with Amazon Prime (I buy at least 5 times a month from Amazon, so it's worth it). I re-sell DVD's and like to replace the cases so there clean and fresh! I've been paying double so I was absolutely ecstatic to cut my cost in half! Even with the word PREMIUM in the title I knew for the price, I would be getting a low-end product but I was willing to give them a try. They are perfect EXCEPT for one problem. THEY LITERALLY STINK! I can't really describe it but to me it's like a burnt plastic smell with sour notes! My daughter said it smells like pee! This is disappointing. Maybe it's just the batch I received. I'm trying to air them so maybe it will dissipate and be tolerable!"
1,The Worst Product Ever Received From Amazon,"I have been purchasing frequently from Amazon for years, and have been quite satisfied with just about any product purchased, except this one. The Title says it all! The clear plastic box cover for these cases was terribly wrinkled on almost all of them. As commented elsewhere by other reviews, the DVD center disk holder and joke of a release was a very poor design. I produce DVDs using the best, Verbatim printable DVD-R, Memorex case inserts, etc. Not caring to spend any more of my life on these, I threw them in the trash. I guess that says more than the title. And they literally stunk!"
1,Black DVD Cases,"Americopy 100 PREMIUM STANDARD Black Single DVD Cases 14MMWe own a movie rental store and usually order our DVD cases from someone else. Decided to try these on Amazon since we get free shipping. I'm sorry to say they are not worth the money. They are so brittle, they break easily. I have had to throw 1 out of 3 away. They just are not the quality I'm used too. I will not purchase these again."
1,These are very very poor,When my order arrived I had some broken cases already in it. I decided to give them a fair try though. I've had a few that had their manual holders broken. I didn't think much of it. But today I had one with an insert and a game in it and everything broke apart. It just cracked into two pieces. I don't see how plastic can do this. It must be very very poor plastic. I feel this has been an unfair deal for me. I am trying to get my money back.
2,Doesn't ANYONE make ones that don't smell anymore?,"Used to be able to buy these in two styles: ones that smell like they came from a burning building, and ones that don't. Seller told me these don't have that smell, and I guess these don't stink as bad as some, but someone used to make ones that don't have that burnt smell at all! I can't find them.Suspicious circumstances, too. Seller I bought them from was Linkyo, (DBA SuperMediaStore, but didn't know that 'till I got the shipping label) - and now when I look back at my order, it says the seller was MyMor Express? What's up with that? Moving target is hard to hit, I guess. Definitely not 'premium' - flimsy and cheap and smelly. If you want a good cdrom (or dvd case) to go, look externally. That's what I'm doing from now on."
5,These were just what I needed!,"This product was exactly what I was looking for, and the ease of order was great! Thank you very much!"
4,Great for the price,"Awesome cases for the price. Bought two boxes full. Will last me awhile. But when I do run out, definitely these cases I will buy."
1,Product Problem,"I ordered Americopy 14MM PREMIUM Standard Black Single DVD cases which are made from New material. I was sent STANDARD Black Single DVD cases which are made from recycled material & are more flimsy. When I contacted Amazon they told me to contact the 3rd party seller about the error. I orderd these from Amazon & I feel it is their responsibility to make the order right, whomever they have to contact. After I phoned the seller they told me the order I received was what Amazon requested from them on their PO. LinkyoExpress was the supplier & they said to return the Standard cases for a refund but they would not replace them with Premium cases at the price on the Amazon web page. So beware when you order this item"
1,Stainless Steel Necklace,"Very small, and dull looking with finish. The clasp was hard to open and close and necklace seems very easy to break. Not worth the money, better off getting a sterling silver chain."
4,Pickin on ccr,The album is good! Nice instrumentals. I have listened to it several times and the quality is good as well.
1,Terrible CD,"This CD is absolutely terrible. When each song starts out you think ""Hey this sounds OK"" and then in comes a pedal steel guitar or a hideously played harminoca run to ruin the bluegrass sound of the song. The banjo and mandolin players are not too bad but the guitar picker seems to be in a world of his own. He is eiter way behind or off playing something totally unrecognizable rather than trying to play with the other musicans.This CD is not true bluergass, nor should it be considered a tribute. An insult, maybe, but not a tribute.I have listened to other Bluegrass Tribute CDs such as the one to John Mellencamp, or the one to Dave Matthews and they are very good, however I wish I had not listented to this album, let alone paid money for it. On a 5 star rating I give it one star only because there is no way to give it negative stars."
3,Bumpy Recording.,This CD gets off to a rough start and then it smooths out about five (5) minutes into the session. The bass is under recorded and the tune selection is boring and Earl sounds bored with this set. I guess that I was expecting too much for my money.
4,Good book to start you out in Computer Forensics,"I heard this book is going to be updated and revamped this year (hopefully). My teacher recommended this book, and it's definitely worth the buy if you're interested in learning more about computers in general."
3,Why would you want to speak like an American?,"Sorry,but as an Aussie I find the concept of wanting to sound like an American highly amusing.Sadly,people in the US are a little too insular there ARE other forms of English out there and the language you speak in the States is just another dialect.I am not sure if I would want to sound like an American~no offence intended!"
4,Great tool to merge in with the native speakers.,Really a great tool for someone who already can speak english pretty well but wanting to gain expertise in speaking it like the native speakers of the USA!
4,Fantastic,"good material, my friend from Santo Domingo likes it and the cd was a good quality the tone was cleared to hear."
2,Speak English Like an American,Neded a way of translating from Spanish to English. Not usefu at all for me. Probabloy for someone else might do.
5,Great tool,"Good dialogues, short but full of idiomatic expressions. I recommend it to persons learning English as a second language. Definitions are good."
1,City Dragon review,"I can honostly state that this is the WORST so called movie I have ever seen. I wish I could get the 3.00 I paid refunded. Made in the 80,s or early 90,s it looks as if a bunch of guys found a can or raw film and thought it would be cool to shoot themselves rambling off ridiculous lines and running around; no attempts at even bad acting here. It's torture to watch.Randolph"
5,My favorite York guidebook,"This is a guide to York's snickets, ginnels, alleyways, lanes, and courts--paths meant especially for pedestrians. The book is set up to guide the reader through 50 snickelways, starting at one archway of Bootham Bar, winding around from one to another (and encuontering lovely parks, squares, courts, views of the Minster, etc. on the way), never going through the same one or crossing one's own path, and finally coming back around through the other arch of Bootham. I went through the first 15 or so snickelways this afternoon and found them absolutely delightful. I feel that I know York much better now and can't wait to continue my tour. Jones includes sketches to go with every map (there are about 25 to cover 50 snickelways) so I could always verify that I was in the right place, and despite my poor sense of direction I never got lost. A charming book on a charming subject."
3,Not a bad birthday present,I got this alarm clock for a birthday present one year ago. I think it is an excellent present. It has a radio it sounds pretty good it has an alarm that is loud anough to wake strong sleepers and the alarm keeps going untill you cut it off. Easy to change the alarm and time. The projector you can only see at night. And you have to ajust it well to be able to see it clearly and that takes about 2 min. Over all I think this is a good product.
3,Not Great Clock,Not a great product. Projection is not bright enough to see on the wall if you are projecting more then eight feet.
4,systematic and technical Heidegger,"It is primarily and for the most part a readable translation of some very difficult to translate, much less understand and appropriate, esoteric thought. An absolute must read for any would-be Heideggerians, and not a bad place to get some insight into Kant at the same time."
3,They are 50/50,"I am all for microfiber - for the underwear nothing is better. I have my expectations, however, and this product falls short of them. The panties are cut well, with the side seams shifted a little towards the belly, so the garments over them look smooth on the hips. The tag is imprinted on the inner side of the back, so there is no plastic tag to scratch and irritate our skin. Good quality microfiber makes these panties feel soft, dry and cool. Actually, they would feel like not at all there, if it wasn't for two major things: 1. The crotch is very narrow, only two inches. That's probably why the panties tend to ""ride up"". 2. The waistband has faulty construction resulting in it rolling in a sort of a doughnut. All in all not a waste of money, but not a bargain either."
3,Not Full Coverage a' la derriere !!,"I love microfiber underwear for the most part. I guess u really have to know what brand fits u best & stick w/ it. I'm not a thong girl, but I don't need ""granny panties"" either.I was looking for a bargain. There is nothing wrong w/ the material or quality. This is why I rated them a 3. They just ride up too high in the rear for my comfort !! The thick waist band defies gravity on me & keeps creeping up my waist - not a wedgie girl either.. LOL !!BTW, I don't have much of a rear end or hips, so maybe the material & cut just had nowhere to go but UP !! =OGive them a test run b4 u purchase several."
4,Spanish review,La mercancía que compré resulto tal y como me fue ofertada. El material es razonable y es confortable. Estoy conforme.
3,"Travelchair Classic Bubba Chair, Black",It is OK. It serves the purpose. It is a little more expensive than I would have expected considering the appearance.
4,Much needed reference material,"This book is not a ""Symbian By Example"" book but is a much needed reference for Symbian and specifically Series 60 topics that are hard to find else where such as Direct Screen Access, S60 App Engines eg. Camera API & Photo Album Engine. Such documentation is not a part of any of the other books available or the SDK documentation - so its great that this book provides that information.Other UI topics such as dialogs and menus etc and general discussions of Symbian OS constructs such as descriptors etc are also included, however these topics have been addressed in other Symbian OS books. All in all this is a must have for any one involved with S60 application development."
4,A Good Starting Point for S60 Programming,"I find this book pretty comprehensive in the breadth of topics it covers. It gives information from the SDK installation to UI features.However, this is not supposed to be a SymbianOS manual and should not be used in such manner.I am quite impressed that this book even covers fonts API in good detail.On the whole, this book is a must for all Series 60 beginners. For a little more advanced Series 60 programmers, this will serve as a good quick reference."
4,Good reference book,"I found couple good infomation in this book, which is not cover in other books. It is a good book again!"
2,Very Disappointed by the Colorism,"Colorism is a within-race prejudice. It's when dark-skinned people of one race are deemed inferior to their light-skinned counterparts. I know Indians come in a huge array of complexions, but most of them are brown. In this work, however, all of them look European or Middle Eastern. Not a single person looks like Sanjay Gupta, M.I.A., Gandhi, or any other South Asian I know.For more than a decade, books and programs for children have tried to promote multiculturalism and diversity. These tales are diverse in origin, but they show the same faces and bodies that we've always seen. How no one can be brown in a cartoon about pre-colonial India is ludicrous and Eurocentric. I'd be very careful before I showed this to children of color.Besides, the animation was cheap and some of the tales have morals with wich I disagree."
3,Clan of the Cave Bear,"The book was good. The writing style was great. Good plot, good characters... But as I read this book, I was baffled; half of the content and details in this book seemed like it was transported from Clan of the Cave Bear series... Does anyone else think so?"
5,destiny mine,"I love historical novels, and as you read it, it takes you back in time. I have always been fascinated by the American India culture. How majestic was mother earth and the respect for every thing, from the bark of the tree to the values of each American Indian tribe. The struggles and the changes of time. I am truly amazed of the extent of the research done on this book. Above all, love conquers all and no matter how we all call ""Him"", we know He's always there. Action, adventure and love. Great book! I read this in hard bound, this time in kindle."
1,Gross,"Purchased hoping would taste like the Starbucks coconut, it's doesn't. Kinda gross, mixture between really fake tasting coconut extract and fake sugar syrup."
2,Lack of taste,I ordered this last week and just used in today. I am disappointed in the lack of coconut taste. I think for the price it should taste more coconutty and less sweet. But as always service was fast from Amazon!
2,Weak,"As others have mentioned, the magnets are way too weak.An adult with a steady hand can make a pyramid. A child can't really make anything three dimensional, as the slightest sideways pressure causes the magnetic rods to disengage from the spheres.The spheres and rods are also hard plastic on the outside, which means that even if the rods don't disengage, they slide around.If the magnets were considerably stronger and either the spheres or rods were ""rubberized"" this would be a much more fun and educational toy. As it is, I'm kind of sorry that I bought it. (I bought it in a toy store, and didn't think to look up the reviews on Amazon first...)"
5,This is my 4 year old's longest standing toy,"My daughter got this at her 1st birthday and she still plays with it regularly. I don't understand the other reviewers' issue with the magnetic strength (maybe the manufacturer reduced the strength recently, but I can't imagine why as these are way too big to swallow anyway). My daughter makes pyramids, pretend rooms for her little doll house furniture, cubes and houses (a cube with a pyramid roof on top. I'd like to get another set so she can build more elaborate things."
1,magnets fall apart too easily,magnets not that strong - difficult to build anything remotely like what is pictured on the box. Would not buy again and should return this product.
1,Weak magnets = bummer!,"We were so excited for our toddler to open these on Christmas morning because he loves playing with his brother's Geomags (which are awesome). His brother's toys are too small and we didn't want him to play with them unsupervised so this seemed like the perfect answer. These toys are a waste of money. The magnets will not even hold together laying on the floor. They would be really nice if the magnets were stronger, but my son doesn't even play with them because they will not stick together! I recommend getting the GEOMAG baby magnets and we are going to try the Guidecraft set. What a waste of money...and I expected more from IPlay."
1,disappointed,Magnets aren't very strong. The pieces don't hold together well even for an adult but it's meant for a small child. I was disappointed. My granddaughter hardly plays with it.
1,House of cards,It is easier to build a house of cards. The pictures are completely deceiving. There is no way that little girl built that structure. We (the parents) couldn't get the simplest triangle to hold together.
1,Huge let down,"We were recently given the Jumbonetics playset as a gift. I was eager to have my daughter build with this new toy, but sadly is was a huge letdown. I believe this toy is a great idea, but it just doesn't work. My 2 year old daughter gets frustrated playing with this set because she really can't build anything. The pictures on the box are misleading because even my husband and I can barely make a structure stay together with anything going vertical."
3,Good for busy hands but requires parent help from time to time.,My son is 19 months and he loves the magnetic aspect of this product. He hasn't really grasped how to build with it but that should come in time. Right now he just loves to stick the objects together. It works better if I help him build things but he loves to do it by himself.
4,Great Value,"The measurement is repeatable, use is very simple and easy, the scale has nice big rubber feet so it doesn't side around, the display is large and clear; I think it is a bargain!"
5,Excellent and elegant,"First of all, the picture shown with the product IS NOT what you get, it is different and almost all black. The upside is that is looks much nicer! It shows your weight, your target weight, how much you lost or gained, how much to reach the target, and it holds up to 3 users` data. It automatically identifies which user is using the scale. It is all I wanted."
5,Fantastic Book,"Not only clearly delineates the design of FreeBSD itself, but also helps the reader understand how operating systems have changed in response to the demands imposed by networked file systems and multi-cpu hardware.A must have."
4,The OTHER freeOS explained,A BSD Bible. I never could read the Bible. I do Believe ...650+ pages of truth and gore. I (as a sysadmin and BSD boomer) related most to the History (Ch.1) and Startup/Shutdown (final Ch.14). Memory management and other gore escapes me. GOOD JOB!
3,Great Pics Abound But Author Is Out To Lunch,"Would rate highly for the many great pics and from a general historical sense.As for the authors take on many of the shows,all credibility is lost when he spews the likes of this: ""Hendrix guitar playing is so full of wrong notes that I suspect he is less than musical or the amplitude of his sound has made his ear stone deaf"".In writing about many other shows and great groups,some of which I saw myself he shows a profound lack of knowledge of the music coupled with an inherent lack of respect,appreciation and more than a little gall based on the fact that he was fortunate enough to have obtained a free lifetime pass and didnt pay a dime to witness all he had.For those who were there,Im sure you will remember it as it truly was and for those who were not,use your imagination.Despite this,a more than worthwhile book just dont pay up for the priviledge."
5,"You Two, Will Agree!","Over the last couple of years I have accumulated a number of these Pickin' On disks. There have been a couple that come to mind that I have used as coasters (Pickin' On: Santana & Bob Dylan) because of the poor rendition of their songs.Now, on the other hand, this collection of U2 songs is my favourite of them all. I would have given it 6 stars if I could. This disk is the only one that I have taken to work to play on my computer. It gives me a lift and puts a smile on my face when ever I play it. I must warn you that it could get you fired if you aren't careful. There is a tendency to be distracted from your work, because of this fine piece of work. Do not operate heavy machinery or perform surgery during the playing of this disk. B^)If you do not own any of the Pickin' Series, I strongly suggest that U buy this one. It's Bonofied as a winner."
5,Neat,"I like this album. It sounds to me like some bluegrass guys picked up a songbook (which just happened to have U2 songs in it) and started playing. Each song is true to the original, but the instrumentation is all mandolines, guitars, fiddles and banjoes.I was very pleased at the balance of this tribute. Too much improvisation would have irritated me, because the songs they picked can't help but remind you how much you like U2. (In a good way, you can tell they like U2 as well.)I was raised listening to my dad's bluegrass records on Saturday mornings while he made pancakes. During the week, my dad's friends would come over with their guitars, and we'd all sing. This tribute is great because the instruments and the band are both so close to me.My dad is not familiar with U2, but I am considering getting this for him. I think he will appreciate the sound, and it will be fun for me to share the music of a band I like so much."
5,My daughter loved getting this for Christmas.,My daughter is a big U2 fan and she also likes blue grass. This was something she had been curious about. She loved getting this music cd for Christmas.
2,No x86 references: outdated,"There is little in this book about x86 Solaris, and the exam hammers on Solaris for intel beyond what you can imagine, reading this book: outdated outdated outdated !!!"
4,Good review of Solaris 10 for sysadmin's familiar with 8 and 9,"This book is a great starter to learn the new features in Solaris 10 and for a general review of OS fundamentals for any sysadmin with Solaris 8 or 9 experience. Not planning to take the cert exam, so can't give any feedback on how this book relates to the exam."
2,Won't prepare you well for the exam,"First, be careful which topics are covered on the exam. In 2010, two of the chapters pertaining to the second exam were actually on the first exam. Second, the real exam questions (especially 310-202) don't resemble this much at all. If you want to learn Solaris, this book will help. If you want to prepare for the exam, find as many other sources of information as possible."
4,High Peak 70 Liter Pack,This pack is an excellent product for casual campers. It packs enough weight for a one or two night camping trip
3,Great buy!,"I really enjoyed this pack. It was the cheapest that I could find anywhere, and worked out very well when I went backpacking in Europe for 2 weeks! Very durable...waterproof...and as comfortable as a 19kg pack could be! :-)"
5,Fabulous deal!!,"I was uincredibly impressed with this pack. It was very affordable compared to all the other packs I looked at online but since it got such great reviews from others I decided to take a gamble and get it for our backpacking trip around Costa Rica. The pack has tons of different storage pockets so that you can organize things and reach them easily (my boyfriend's much pricier bag was just one giant tube which he had to unpack and repack to find things), there is also a zipper down the side of the main pack to reack things at the bottom without unpacking the whole bag. My favorite pat was that when the whoe thing is zipped up and buckled none of the pockets can be reached without unbuckling the bag so I didn't have to worry about pickpocketers getting into the bag while it was on my back in crouded streets, bus stations, etc. It held up very well for being packed very tightly and on the move for 2 plus weeks."
2,It's Okay,This toy was alright for a little while. Then it completely broke in half. I recoomend not getting this item.
3,Go-Ped air filter review,"I bought this air filter for my son's Go-Ped Sport. The filter came with all necessary parts and bolted on nicely (10 minutes for complete R&R;). Finish and quality is good. I have K&N; air filters in my cars, so I just use the spray-on cleaner and oil already on hand for that application, which works perfectly (available at pretty much any automotive store).Only problem (and thus the three star rating) is that the choke is integrated with the OEM air filter (not on the carb) and this Baja filter has no integrated choke. End result: no choke once this filter is installed. We live in Florida (warm weather year round), so it's not a huge problem (although my 11-year-old son now has to struggle to start it when cold). But if you live in even a remotely cold climate, you might want to rethink this filter. Maybe somebody makes a flat choke valve I don't know about that sandwiches between this filter and the carb."
5,"short, sweet, good lesson, not tiring to read over and","Artwork is beautiful and story is a decent length, enjoyable and good lesson! I would enjoy reading it over and over as much as a youngster would enjoy hearing it!"
4,Dances with Bears,"A story about a boy named Short Tail, who is afriad that Grandfather bear has not survived the winter. No one has seen the bear, and it is past springtime. So Short Tail decides to climb the mountain and see if the bear is still alive. When he gets there he sees that the bear is still sleeping. Short Tail wakes the bear, and the bear takes him to a special meeting place of the bears. While at this place, the bears dance to celebrate the ending of winter. Grandfather bear tells Short Tail to go back and show his people the dance so they can do it also. It is a good story about why the Natives dance."
3,Good cover concept,"As other reviewers note, these Butterfield covers don't have the freshness and ferocity of the originals. But this is still a good listenable blues album with the Robben Ford sound. Not his best album, and not as good as the best of Paul Butterfield or Best of Mike Bloomfield cds."
2,"RICK SHAQ GOLDSTEIN SAYS: ""THE NURSE SAID, THEIR HEART WAS IN THE RIGHT PLACE, DR. SHAQ SAID THE PATIENT DIED!""","When the Butterfield Blues came out with one of the greatest, ahead of its time, blues album, ""EAST WEST"", even with the ""caveman"" type recording equipment they had available, compared to today, it sounded way better than this! I happen to own an original vinyl album, and it still sounds better than this. If you're hungry for ""Paul Butterfield and the Butterfield Blues"", don't buy this, there are digitally re-mastered greatest hits CD's available, and Shaq, ""The King Of The World Blues Reviewer"", will be reviewing it in the coming weeks. I've always wondered, why someone re-does something, if it isn't as good or better than the original? Like ""Oceans Eleven"" the movie. If you were going to rebuild the ""STATUE OF LIBERTY"", you wouldn't use Popsicle sticks, you'd use gold!"
2,And the point is?,"Don't get me wrong; I love Robben Ford. But this isn't so much a tribute as an attempt to duplicate the originals. So one must make the inevitable comparion--and frankly, the originals are much cooler. If one must compare, sure, Robben plays rings around Elvin Bishop. But he's no Mike Bloomfield and his brother is no Paul Butterfield."
1,No Substitute for the Original Butterfield!,"Why waste money on a bunch of covers when you should be buying THE ORIGINAL?! Butterfield cannot be copied, duplicated or covered to any justice to his brilliance. Robben Ford is a rock musician hiding under the guise of the blues. PHONEY! Buy Butterfield's Elektra Anthology for a journey through the various incarnations of one of the most authentic white blues artists in the world. Pay particular attention to ""Driftin & Driftin"", ""Everybody's Gonna Be Alright"" ""The Work Song"" and ""East-West"". Then you'll know and have a greater appreciation of Paul and The Butterfield Blues Band. Don't buy a substitute, when you can own the ORIGINAL!"
4,Best Knee Pads Available,"I'm a tile setter with very sensitive knees and these are the best knee pads available. They do have some drawbacks such as the size, they're very large and look dorky but they are very soft on the knees and you don't have to balance on them because of the shape of the cap like other knee pads.Until I find a better knee pad I'll be using these."
3,Kneepads for an elephant,The knee pads are nice except they are fitted for an elephant.. I'm avarage size and have to adjust the pads so 80% of the velcro strap hangs forward. If they moved the strap back 2 inches it would be great and fit 95% of men.. I say men because they would never fit the average or slighly above average woman.
5,BEST KNEE PADS EVER,THEESE KNEE PADS ARE BY FAR THE BEST AND MOST COMFORTABLE KNEE PADS I HAVE EVER USED. I RECOMEND THEM TO ANYONE!
1,Buy sawson's and save $ and better quality.,"Hawthorn is a good way to help your circulatory system and cardiovascular system. It helps keep blood pressure in check. Although I find Swanson hawthorn is far superior to Nature's way hawthorn. I ended up having to take 12 a day when I used nature's way normally I use 3 of Swanson's hawthorn for the same results I get when I use Swanson's, and it is well worth the price, and keeps my blood pressure in check with 3 capsules a day instead of using 12 of nature's way a day. Swanson's product is cheaper and you get more for your money."
2,Dull and overwritten,"This is a book of similarly themed short stories, half of which are short shorts only a few pages long. The characters are people whose lives are untenable. They come from abusive upbringings and are now feeling trapped in their lives.Straub is an excellent writer and creates vivid, if odd, characters. However, most of these stories didn't work for me. The short shorts were for the most part vague ramblings, not cohesive stories. Of the longer pieces, Blue Rose was the best. It's about an 11 year old boy who reads an old book on hypnotism and discovers he has a gift for it when he puts his younger brother under and something terrible happens. The story suffers only from a weak, anticlimactic ending. The Juniper Tree is a rote pedophilia tale that also ends poorly. The Buffalo Hunter and Mrs. God were both overwritten, going on far longer than was necessary."
1,Doors that go nowhere,"Initially, I was excited to pick up a collection of short stories by Straub. But, this has got to be my least favorite of all of Straub's work. Every story seems disjointed an incomplete. I never got a full sense of what happened by the time i finished each story. I kept reading the book, however, in hopes of finding a gem. I came close with ""Mrs. God"", but again felt let down on the outcome. Each story is too much buildup and not enough delivery. I was glad to finish this book and put it back on the shelf. Despite the positive reviews, I was not impressed."
2,Too heavy on handle end,"These tools are made of high quality materials, and they look very nice. However, the ends of the handles are so thick and heavy that if you leave them propped on the side of a shallow pot or pan, or on the counter, they are very prone to flip out of the container or off of the counter, carrying food with them to the kitchen floor. This happened to me twice while cooking thanksgiving dinner. I will not throw them away, but I would never buy them again."
3,"Looks great, but...","This set looks great, but when I went to use it for the first time, I was really disappointed. The handles are very heavy. This doesn't work well if you like resting the spatula in the pan while things simmer because a)the handle tips over, and b)the shiny metal part of the handle (that I really liked) gets VERY hot and will burn you!!! Also, this set is heat resistant, but only until the top of the utensil. You see where the shiny metal part makes a horizontal line on the handle? Well from there up, it is NOT heat resistant...it melted the first time I used it. This also is something you want to consider if you like to rest your utensils in the pot. Overall, they look great, but they aren't very functional."
4,A VERY GOOD SAMPLER OF FATS,"This compilation spans a longer period than that by Robert Parker, and contains 6 more titles, but with one exception (Willow Tree, by the Louisiana Sugar Babes) confines itself to those records Fats made under his own name. So it's a less varied mix, which comprises seven piano solos, an organ solo, a dozen of Fats & his Rhythm, and one of Fats with his Buddies. Sound quality is excellent, but in my opinion there are five numbers which do not merit inclusion in a selection which claims to be his best recordings. But if you want a ""sampler"" of Fats singing some of his best-known songs, together with some piano solos, then this should do nicely."
5,Nice!,"I bought this as a gift for a friend visiting from out of state. Not only is it chock full of wonderful southern recipes, it also has pages here and there with trivia and information about the state of Arkansas. My friend was delighted with those little ""extras"" and I think it made a great souvenir for her."
5,Incredible Songstress/Healer,"My grandmother took us all to see Harry Bellefonte as a special treat years ago, and the best part of it was that Ann Mortifee was the opening act! I fell in love with her and her wonderful voice at that time ... the whole massive auditorium standing up and singing ""It's in Every One of Us"" was so incredibly moving. This is my favorite album of hers, I highly recommend it to anyone, but especially anyone on a Healing Journey. -Kathi Petersen"
1,"Great product, terrible price","Do not buy at this price! There are a dozen retailers, on line and brick and mortar, who sell Torani syrups for much less. What a rip-off!"
3,nice taste,Pretty nice taste to add to a green tea latte. It's pretty sweet so you have to be carefull how much you put it but it really livens up a latte.
2,Never use it,"This is well made, has nice ridges on the inside, and works exactly like it looks.In practice, I never use it. It's a little too small and slippery to get a good grip.I just use a towel typically."
3,"Effective, but too small","I find I must be very careful about finger placement before moving any hot things around because the moment I am not paying attention is the one where I burn myself. My hands are rather small, too, so anyone with regular or large hands might want to look around for a bigger set. The concept is great, and they do prevent heat transfer."
2,Disappointed in silcone pothandle holder,"Fully realizing that it's always Buyer Beware---- I was disappointed to see how small the product is.Yes, the dimensions were listed. My bad for not noticing them.My complaint: I have average sized female hands. I couldn't safely lift out a tray of muffins since the pad wouldn't accommodate more than fingers on the pan. And yes, I MIGHT have bought two (suggested) but didn't think I needed two.My suggestions:Put a coin next to the image to make sure the buyer realizes how small they are.If you're a man with larger hands, the pad is definitely too small.If you're a senior citizen and need more support lifting a hot casserolefrom the oven---- DO NOT BUY THIS PAD. Even having two wouldn't help because by the time you removed the casserole out far enough to use the second pad---- the casserole might be on the floor!"
4,Great for use in combination with another holder,"This holder is very good to get big pans or metal handle pots without the risk or burning yourself or the pot slipping through your hand, but they either should come in pairs or accompanied by a mitt or another holder. By itself is mostly useless as being so thick and small, you cannot get the appropriate grasp to hold a big put or pan in your hand, the way you do with a towelFor that I give it four stars, but it is a great product"
2,Minimal versatility,I was hoping to use this product as an aide for my children in the kitchen...but have found that it is difficult for even myself to use. The holder does work well on certain handles but not at all universal. I have only a few saute pans and the like and two of which are not cool handle. The holder works well on one but not the other in that there is minimal flexibility with the holder thus requiring you to hold in a specific way making it very difficult to adjust for cooking.
1,Worse than Bad,This is a zero star book. Mind-numbing in detail about WW II infantry tactics supposedly still in use in the age of interstellar travel. The entire senseless wrap-up of the plot is done in one page. Even the author must have been tired of the whole thing.
5,Traditional Culture Clashes with Changes From the West,"Read this book if you want a deeper understanding of what came before Western colonialization and religion appeared in Africa. If more world leaders had read this book since its publication in the 1950s, there might have been fewer tragic results in the West's economic, political and cultural domination of traditional societies around the world.Everyone to whom I have recommended this book has thanked me and passed on the good advice to others. Although the beginning to Chinua Achebe's novel can feel slow, and the names difficult to pronounce, make the effort to write your own character chart and follow the narrative through to the end. Your reward will be days, weeks, even months of deeper thinking about the results of ""inevitable"" change. There are no easy answers here, only deeper understanding and healthy nuance."
2,Slow and Hard to Grasp,"I had to read this for my Lit class and it took me 2 months to get through because I fell asleep everytime I opened it up. It did have some good things about culture in it, but a text book could have easily done that in about 5 pages."
3,READ THE OTHER REVIEWS-- THEY ARE MORE THOUGHTFUL,"I have read Things Fall Apart at three different times in my life, and I still don't love it. I probably never will love it, but I can appreciate and admire it for the fact that Achebe captures something of the essence and non-linear quality of living in an oral/verbal culture rather than one that is more focused on reading and writing. The stories of oral traditions are passed on by word of mouth and therefore change slightly with retelling. The stories essentially embody the same characteristics as the original story, but different twists certainly must come into play depending on the teller because memory and experience can also influence how one tells a story."
1,stupid,"i had to read this for a lit class...the writer is only famous because he is a minority. The babar books are better written than this. If you want to immitate hemmingway, at least TRY and do it withought sounding like a 3rd grader."
2,my review,i liked how it was a book on a type of tribe. i liked the names in the book too. i didn't like how the book was. it was confusing. it was too long. i think it should or should not be read in class depending on the type of students in the class.
2,Read Another Book,"What I think. I think his book was very boring. I really did not understand it. It had humongous words in it, that were very hard to understand. If I were to tell someone my opinion about thisi book I would say to read a different book."
1,please,"all i can say is see for yourself, go to barns and nobles, read it, then tell me how much you loved it! i regret even touching the book."
1,The legend of Okonkwo,"I can't type anything because I did'nt read this book or I did'nt pay much attention to the story because it did'nt catch my intrest; but I could tell you that Onkonkwo was very abusive to his family and he made his son feel low because he wanted him to be a man and he did'nt want him to be like his father because his father was an man who did nothing but play a flute and ask people for money to drink up. He also treated him that way because he wanted him to keep continue a strong family and not make an mistake to weaken the family. He also treated his wives like crap and he showed no respect to them, but when Ikemefuna came to his house most of the things change because he quit beating his son and he treated his son with some respect."
5,"Things may fall apart, but somehow this center holds","Chinua Achebe is a masterful story teller.In the Nigerian tradition, Achebe crafts a tale of Okonkwo, a strong man who cannot change. More than that, the reader is brought within the realm of pre-contact African society, specifically Umuofia.Achebe drops his reader into the midst of this society often without explaination or apology, immersing him in a true 'sink or swim' environment.Although this edition contains a glossary for the various Ibo words and phrases sprinkled throughout, flipping back and forth would disrupt the flow of the narrative and become rather annoying. Instead, I advise the reader to trust the author. Achebe is a talented man and you won't be left in the dark for long.Achebe's diction and skillfull description make this a truly unique story and, understandably, a modern classic."
3,Slow Moving for Too Long,"Most of the book is devoted to setting the stage for the final fifth (if you like lengthy descriptions of primitive African tribeswomen preparing meals you're going to love this novel). On the other hand, when someone blandly points out that European influences in Africa destroyed a way of life that perhaps didn't need to be destroyed, you will know from reading this book precisely what that way of life was like. It's a sort of African ""Gone With the Wind."" Achebe makes no judgments; he simply tells what happened. And he leaves it to you, the reader, to supply your own sense of devastation. I just wish we could have been treated to a little more plot in the first four-fifths of the book. A lot of kids are assigned this book in high school, and I can see why they go stir-crazy trying to sit still and read it. That they are eventually rewarded by a brilliant ending must be, for them, scant recompense for their toils."
4,Things Really Do Fall Apart,"Chinua Achebe does an excellent job in accomplishing his goal. He lets his readers know how at any time or place, things can never stay the same forever. Someone or something will always come to interfere and perhaps destroy what has been created through years of work. That's life unfortunately and Chinua is very aware of this. Chinua does a superb job in helping his readers understand the culture with the names he uses and his detailed explanantions of the rituals. The outcome is unexpected but its what compliments the title, which I enjoyed mostly because it's so strong and meaningful."
5,When Things Fall Apart,"Chinua Achebe was the epitome of ""the storyteller"" in this powerful novel! While communicating the very true story of the infiltration of christians and their beliefs into a peaceful and established African culture, he was able to give fictitious characters a powerful life that seeped from the words on the pages and into the hearts and minds of the reader!cheryl (student)Montclair State University"
3,A True Look at Africa...,"An easy read, but hard to comprehend. This is a story of another world, with different values and morals which are not easy to grasp. I would only recommend this book to someone who is willing to invest time in it."
4,Consistent Greatness from Achebe,"I enjoyed No Longer at Ease more than this book, but it was still a very enjoyable and thought provoking read."
3,Subject matter didn't thrilll my child,"My child needed this book for school. Easy ordering, fast shipment, sent just as described. So much easier than trying to find it at a store. My teenager didn't enjoy the book though. He said the characters were of no interest to him and that they didn't have any redeeming qualities. Oh well...Thanks!"
2,i really wanted to care,"at the risk of sounding superficial i found the book awkward and trite. the characters were never whole so that i cared about them. there was plenty of gore but the shallowness of the individuals who caused it or were damaged left me uninvolved. the flatness could be attributed to the unsophistication of the tribesmen, but there was too much of the noble savage and too little humanity to involve me in their lives."
5,good version,this version is good because it's printed clearly and there's enough space for annotating. i actually really loves this book. it's a master piece.
5,Great!,"The seller listed the books as ""acceptable"" condition, but really the book was in great condition. There were only a few worn edges--nothing serious. Also, the book was promptly delivered. Overall, great purchase."
3,"History, yes, but not much of a story","Insofar as this book offers a glimpse of indigenous life in Africa just before the intrusion of European government and Christianity, it is interesting and feels genuine. The story itself is dull and tedious for a western reader, with few handholds for emotional involvement. As with other books I have reviewed which simply don't work for me, despite their evident worth, I fall back on ""Would I recommend this to my reader friends?""No."
4,"Thought-provoking, eye-opening","Don't read this book if you expect a riveting, fast-paced story with a simple, shallow, hit-you-over-the-head plot; read Cussler or someone else for that. _Things_Fall_Apart_ provides the West with a rare insight into a culture of which far too many of us are ignorant. At times Achebe's message is subtle, but at other times it is unmistakably clear. I think the readers who panned the book are probably disillusioned high school students, unwilling or unable to examine the book's true meaning. If you're bored with the conventional and feel like expanding your mind a bit, give the book a shot. It's a quick read, written in uncomplicated language, that will keep you thinking."
3,not so great,"when I read this book, I never really got into it. The characters were sort of boring, and the parts that the author seemed to want to make dramatic were predictable."
5,short and sweet,"This book is a timeless classic. Very short, it only takes a few hours to read but the author still managed to paint a vivid portrait of not only the Ibo people but also of the politics of colonialism. When read from a more modern perspective, the phrase ""global village"" has alot of meaning. The most fascinating thing about this bit of literature is that is gives a completely unbiased view from the perspective of the Africans. (Sounds like an oxymoron eh?) After all, you really can't know a culture until you really UNDERSTAND it."
2,I Hate Yams,"So I'm in 9th grade, and I had to read this book. We read so many interesting things, ""Frankenstein"", ""Animal Farm"", and ""To Kill A Mocking Bird"". And then this book. Most boring book I think i've ever read in my life. Even so it does go by pretty fast, and catched you at moments. But, the yams got to me."
2,Why me???,"This book is about a time in Africa right before the white people came and settled in Africa with their christianity,and other beliefs that wasn't coherent with the original inhabinents life style. this book takes a look at the african life-style and the changes it was forced to go through in its adjustments to white people and their beliefs. this book makes you look through the eyes of one man, that mans name is Okonkwo. Okonkwo was an abusive, violent, powerful, and vengeful. Okonkwo never knew love, compassion, and understanding. let's imagine a time when people act like savages and do what they want with no repercussions and you will have the same story line as this book. This book opened my eyes to what life could be like if we weren't civilized and had didn't have common sense. In my view and opinion this book is not for people with short attention spans or just have to do it for a class assinment."
1,Blah,This book was the worst i have ever read. It could barely hold my attention and i'm an avid reader. The story wasn't at all interesting until the end. i wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.
1,worst book that i have ever read,this is the worst book that i have ever read! the story have no point at all.
2,small minded,Chinua Achebe takes an enjoyable narative style aims it at an alternative perspective of european expansionism and colonization and succeeds only in proving his own small mindedness. Achebe crafts a precise and very detailed narative setting forth an argument against colonialism that fails to consider anything that might lessen its drama. The perspective becomes self centered and biased and its realism dies. The book seems shaped around a view point so narrow and tunnelled that even the very real and human aspects of the tale are distorted and lessened. If his were the only argument against colonialism Achebe would have gauranteed its continuation - thank goodness it isn't!!
1,One of the world's most overrated books,"I would argue that Achebe creates a violent and sexist main character who is little more than a stereotype of the African male. If a white novelist had written this book, it would have been dismissed out of hand as lacking in complexity and therefore lacking in a key component of literary merit."
1,worst book I've ever read,"I had to read this last year for English class. This was the most dull, misogynistic piece of crap I've ever had the misfortune of reading. To all students: spark notes this. Do yourself a favor."
2,"This Will Go in my ""Bad Book"" Pile","I had to read this book for my junior year in English. It's not a difficult rnovel if you can go for awhile being bored out of your mind. Well, OK. It's wasn't *that* boring, but I still would have preferred to read something with more content and less inconsistancies.Achebe tries way too hard to insert symbolisism and make himself come off as a talented writer, when really, he's just pulling out tricks. Not to say Achebe isn't a talented writer. I've read a few of his essays and they are quite good, but Things Fall Apart is not one of the better book I've read.Okonkwo is an agressive, sexest and disgustingly manish man, and it's absurd that people can even suggest that he obtained hero status in this story"
2,No better the second time...,"This is the second time that I have read Things Fall Apart and I didnt like it any better this time. Although the book incorporates two very important concepts, hubris and the unability to grow and change with society, I still found the book boring and difficult to read. I definately wont be reading this one a third time."
5,Brilliant.,"This book is a terrific and depressingly truthful textual depiction of the utter destruction of much African culture upon the arrival of European Christian ""saviors"". The loss of such unique and awesome culture in Africa should be saddening to everyone, and this book should make the reader reexamine the stupidity and ridiculousness of the barbaric European invasion and ""civilization"" of an already more civilized continent."
5,things fall apart,This book was amazing. It shows how Ibo people lived and what happened when the English came. It is heart touching.
5,Perspective Change,"I read Things Fall Apart several years ago, and then I taught it in an AP Literature class in high school. The author helped me to understand that the Western perspective, and even the perspective of Christian missionaries, while well-meaning can also sometimes be harmful in other cultures. It is so easy to see things through the lens of our own culture and not realize how things may look different in another culture. There is lots of ""food for thought"" in the book!"
5,African culture,"Such an excellent story illuminating past tribal culture of an African tribe. So well written. If you want to read one book about African culture, choose this one."
3,Things Fall Apart,"The condition of the book was terrific, as well as the date of arrival was prompt, as promised. I really appreciate when I get exactly what I pay for. Thank you."
5,Things Fall Apart details colonialism in relation to Nigeria,Chinua Achebe writes this novel to inform the reader about the various struggles African culture had to endure in order to avoid total destruction. Not only did the culture survive but the people as well. They continued practicing their own beliefs until death. This was not the case with every person in the Ibo tribe though. Alot of people converted because of the harsh treatment they would be subjected to if they refused accept Christianity. They were taught that their culture and rituals were wrong and uncivilized. They were systematically stripped of any type pride and dignity. Then they were brainwashed with European teachings and ideologies. The novels main character is a man named Onkonkwo. Onkonwko experiences several inner and outer struggles which are symbolic in the novel. Reading this novel will help one understand the power struggle Africans experienced with the introduction of colonialism into Africa.
4,Good portrayal of native american culture,"Although I was required to read this novel for my english class, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Having never been familiar with the whole culture difference, it opened my eyes to a lot of hardship as well as a lot of injustice. In addition, it vividly portrayed the huge seperation that occurred between the British and the indigenous peoples. Achebe paints a vivid picture that all ages can relate to and understand."
3,Hard to follow,I think this would have been easier to following reading it instead of listening to it for short periods of time.
2,It Drags,"While the story itself is useful in giving a student the right mindset for African studies, the story itself lacks much of the marvel of other historically-based books. While the book is pointed towards lower-classmen in high school, the true audience should be college, where adults can completely analyze and idnetify the key points and emotions of the story."
1,What's the big deal?,"I have put off reading this book since my college days but felt that I should give it a try since I see it on so many must-read lists for literature. What a waste of time. The story was dry and boring and never captured my interest. The only reason that I finished it was because it was only 207 pages, so I decided to just suffer through it. A classic? Not in my book."
1,"Boring, Boring, Boring","I got forced to read this Novel for my Literature Class and I hated it like nothing else 'round here. I mean, as the Science Fiction fan that I am, reading something like this was a pain in the ass. But hey, I read Tlostoy's ""War and Peace"" which is not Science Fiction and I liked it, so I thought that this was going to be the same. No."
1,THIS is a classic?,"The higher the expectation, the more bitter the disappointment can be. This book proves it. Supposedly, ""Things Fall Apart"" is one of the three or four classic, must-read books of African literature. If this is a classic, I don't want to see the B-list. Minimal character development; no explanation for bizarre, cruel, impulsive behavior of the protagonist or others. I had no idea what made these characters tick. And so the story didn't grab me because I didn't have empathy or understanding for or of the people who were in it. The title is great; unfortunately, ""things fell apart"" after I opened the book. STEVE MEISTER"
1,Poor writting with no plot!,This book didnt even have a plot until the last 50 pages. No one cared about Okonkwo's yams!I only read this book because it was required and I hope that no one would ever read it for pleasure.
1,I'd rather rip out my eyes,"I had to read this for school years ago, we had just finished the kite runner which i loved. i adored it. So i kept an open mind to reading this with high hopes for liking this as muchi cant stand it. i really tried to get into it, but I'll never pick this book up again"
1,Argh,"I'm not going to tell any one not to read this novel because of my personal opinion. It is up to you to decide on how to interpret or accept this novel. I, myself, found it boring and unmoving. Yes, I am interest in learning about other cultures, but I think this could have been written better. I also believe it needed a deeper meaning, without simple symbolism everyone tends to exhaust. I only see this a novel worth reading if you're not looking for depth."
1,this book blows,"i hated this book. it's horrible. just a bunch of stories that happened to the same few people. no plot, lousy tales, and distant characters."
1,YUCK!,I'm not much of a reader but I know a good book when I read one. Sorry Achebe but this one was well...BLAN! Didn't keep my interest at all. I read it for school and only becuz i had to. THe story never really picked up and got me interested. I didn't much care for Okonkwo either. What right does he have to boss his wives around and beat them. Of course the women didn't know better. Eh...still one star. Maybe even half a star.
1,"Awful in its Fiction elements, just chronical interest","I found myself studying the elements of this novel and, after a somewhat promising setup in the first chapter (when one is driven to believe the plot is made of Okonkwo's conflict with someone in his village or with his own personality), I could see the scenes dissolving into nothingness and losing any dramatic grip it could've had at the beginning. Most of the novel sets Okonkwo's issues apart and is focused in how the rites, ceremonies, marriages and feasts of the Umuofia village are being prepared. Anyone looking great Fiction entertainment, great characters and memorable conflicts should be dissapointed. On the other hand, some Historians or Anthropologists might find it resourceful of the lives in Nigeria's thribes before Colonialism."
1,would rather eat maggots,I was forced to read this book for my high school lit. class and I am truly convinced that the teacher did it for cruel and unusual punishment. It is almost impossible to concieve how boring this novel was. The main character was very annoying. He was arrogant and never interesting. you never got to get personal with the character's. It was like reading a quick obituary. The plot never got good and there was no humor. only flat meaningless words.I'm not the only one who felt this way. No one in my class liked the book and we complained everyday. my best friend was incapable finishing the book. if you're a kid in school don't even try it.
3,More entertaining than what I thought.,"*SPOILER*I thought at the beginning of the this book, I would not like it. However, it wasn't that bad.The story is about a man and his relationship with the world around him. He lives in a tribe in Africa where he is a well respected member. He has many wives and many children. His one major flaw is his fear of failure. He constantly acts on his own pride and does not consider other people's feelings.The story describes his life when white people come and intervene with their way of life. He has to see one of his own sons convert to christianity, which he feels is a personal attack on himself. The book then ends with him giving up and committing suicide, which is also against his culture. This could mean he was finally giving in to white culture.I wasn't totally impressed with it. but it was still a good read. I would recommend it to people who like the more intellectual reading. It's not for the casual reader."
3,It was okay,"I think this novel is okay. The two thing I like about this novel is that the story is based on realistic events, and the fact that it shows tragedy to a man, Okonkwo, who strives for acceptance in his fellowmen. The two things that I didn't like about this story is that the story can be alittle boring from the lack of adventure, and action. The novel was interesting to read, but I won't recommend it to someone who likes adventure. It can get boring at times, but overall it was okay"
3,mtk,"Things fall apart is a novel about an African man, Okonkwo, in Africa, whose whole world is turned upside down. The ibo people believed in their ancestors and multiple gods. This all changes when missionaries come to Africa and begin comvertiong the Ibo people. The ibos were used to tradition which was disrupted by the white men.The white men harmed the Ibos more them they helped them. the imperialistic views of the white men ruined African culture and their communitys. They drove some Africans to insanity because they were not accustumed to the white mans ways. But at the same time the white men did moderize there society.I gave this book three stars because overall it was an ok book. The different traditions and celebrations was interesting to me. They gave me a new outlook on African culture. I did not like it because names were confusing and could become very boring in some parts. I recomend this book to anyone who wishes to learn about African culture."
3,Review of Things Falling Apart,"In my Opinion the book was ok. It wasn't one of the best books i've ever read nor one of the worst books I ever read. It does have some qualities, themes, and lessons that are important however. One theme is the struggle between tradition and change. This is shown the Okonkwo, the main character, and his village trying to hold onto their traditions in the face of rising conflicts and change with the white men, their government, and the church that is started near their village. Another is the view on masculinity which is shown by Okonkwo and his struggle to be different from his lazy neglectful father. He then tries to teach his son his ideas yet they don't take route. This ends up in beatings from Okonkwo to his children and wives because of his stress. Even though this book was not interesting (to me at least) it does contain many important lessons and themes as mentioned above."
4,Things Fall Apart,"As a entertainment novella I wouldn't rate this book too high. However, this is a culturally diverse book, and I believe it is important enough to say that everybody should read it. I don't own it, and I probably won't ever read it again, but I am glad that I did, and it certainly is a great book for discussion. It makes you think about if it is ever justified for one culture to repress the beliefs and practices of another culture. If these sort of philosophical/political/social thoughts and ideas are a passion of yours, or you are interested in classic and culturally important books, definitely read it."
4,Things Fall Apart,"The product took a fairly long time to get to me, however when it did i was pleased with the decent condition that it was in."
5,Great Book,The book was in great conditon for how old it was. This was also a very smooth transaction. I would buy from this consumer again.
2,Thank God For Missionaries,"An interesting look into tribal life. From what I learned here, I feel that for once, the missionaries were on the mark in trying to elevate this hopeless crew of superstitious, murderous, misogynists. Good riddance to their culture. (not that ours is much better of course)."
1,Probably the worst book I've ever read!,"This is probably the worst book I've ever read. It's very difficult to follow and leaves out much which could explain to the uninitiate the point of the book. As someone who has read thousands of books (literally!), I found this one stilted and forced, unreadable, pointless, unpleasant, poor character development, etc. ad nauseum. The only reason I read it is that I couldn't believe my 8th grader when he said the teacher who assigned it said it was a bad book (and, yes, she assigned it anyway!). It is an excellent example of how not to write a book you want people to read. Avoid this one like the plague, unless you've read every other book on the face of the planet."
1,Okonwos Story,I really didnt understand the book. But the only thing I understand was when Okonkwo killed his son and another part I understood was when okonkwo killed himself at the end of thr story...
4,A book of parables,"The book uses oral history and parables to illustrate the many facets of humanity. I think too many readers focus in on the literal and don't understand that the author is really giving us a story of life in all its wonderful, silly, humane and tragic episodes."
4,"Great read, but requires patience and insight","I read this book for my high school English literature exam. At first I found the use of native words mixed with English rather perplexing (which is a bit odd considering I grew up in E. Africa).On the 2nd and subsequent reads, the tragedy of this 'hero' unfolds. Okonkwo's fateful woes work against what would have been a great man's destiny. He allows fear to rule his life and this eventually leads to his sad demise."
4,Things fall apart indeed,"This story moved me. Without judging anyone (and there are few characters in this book one would judge sympathetically) this tells the story of a man before and during the beginning of British colonization. My major disappointment is that although the story and characters are compelling, the writing is dismal. If you would like to read novels set in Nigeria which have really good writing, try Ben Okri's Famished Road. In short, this won't be the most exciting read of your day, but it is certainly enlightening and moving --- but far from uplifting."
3,Good recording,"I'm not the biggest fan of the novel: it works better in theory than as literature for me. Still, you might get another ""read"" through if you have this well read version in your car."
4,Things really do fall apart,"Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe is a glimpse into the culture of the Ibo tribe of Nigeria and a look at what happens when Christian missionaries come to town. Achebe does a wonderful job of making the reader step out of his own shoes and sympatize with the clan, even though their customs seem strange or even savage to people of western culture. Were they better off on their own, being ignorant to the rest of the world, or did the missionaries actually help them? You be the judge."
3,"not too bad, but not good","This book was one of the most average books I've read. The tribal life was very interesting, and the themes were significant, but I felt like it was too anticlimactic. I was still wondering about Ezinma and Chielo, and why she was taken for the night. Was it just to cure her, or is she going to talk to the gods? I hated the ending, but I agree that that is what should have happened. I only had an interest in Okonkwo part of the time. I did like how he was given flaws, though. I think it could have been a much better novel."
4,Its better than you think,"This celebrated novel is far from the best book I've ever read but at the same time provides some serious insight into the Imperialistic movement in Africa both at the time the novel was written and now. True, Achebe can drag out descriptions about the customs of different tribes etc, but lets afford him that because he has the obligation to not only write great prose but also provide a little bit of the African culture to the Western world as an ambassador of African literature. The novel is frighteningly vivid in its descriptions, well thought out in terms of political ideals, and a valuable piece of evidence in the argument about the clash of cultures in Africa."
3,love it,Things Fall Apart was an exceptional book. It gave us insight on how life was back in that time frame. I really enjoyed the book.
4,Looking through the eyes of the strong,"Things Fall Apart gives a great out look on how we as today view our world. From the views of Chinua your able to see the darker side of our world. Our beliefs in our culture should be looked at then asked. Have we made all of the correct human decissions as to how we live today with religon. I admire how strong the tribe keep their cultures intact. In the end some tribe memebers did convert over,however, this would allow some diversity. This is a good thing, reason being that it gave the tribes more of a challenge to be different yet still the same."
4,As Expected,"Thus far, the book seems to be a credible glimpse of West African culture wrapped within a fictional format. The writing is crisp if at times a little stilted."
4,Easy read- but deeper meanings,"I liked TFA. I thought it was easy to read and it offered insight into African life. It also highlighted the terrible invasion of African tribes by whites. The book is an easy read, but needs time for further examination because there exists many differnt levels of interpretation."
2,It's alright.,"I didn't do too much reading from this book, even though it was assigned to us for class. It's probably not a book I would choose to read in my spare time."
2,TFA novel,I can't really give you a review because it didn't interest me at all. After I pass the third chapter I didn't pay attention to the book. I still read the whole book because my teacher said we have to.
4,Surprisingly fulfilling,The book was really cheap and was in the condition it was described as. (If that makes sense.)
2,Significant but dull,"Achebe is ambitious in his quest to undermine the African stereotypes that have been maintained by the media since the days of European slave trading. He does so and the reader is acutely aware of the ""civilization"" and complexity of tribal life. His goal of altering Western perception of tribal Africa is realized. However, it was as if I was reading a history book with someone interjecting with stories of tribal life, African vocabulary, and mined cliches, rather than a novel with strongly developed characters, dialogue, and plot structure. I teach this book in my 12th grade class and I must admit, I was as bored as the students. Pick up a documentary on tribal Africa instead."
1,I personally thought the book was very boring.,"The book was very boring. I didn't enjoy it. It draged on and on. Well if you enjoyed it, great, but it was so bad I would never reccomend it."
1,"This makes Africa look worse, not better....","My my, this book is downright awful. I can't believe that I was forced to read this book. The language in this book was too confusing, and I can't even believe that anyone could enjoy reading a book like this. You need a translator for every single page. This book is way too confusing for the average reader (I am an honors student) and even the more advanced reader would find difficulty reading this book. If I could rate this book with no stars, I certainly would."
3,The book was well developed and interesting.,"I liked the way the author developed Okonkwo. Even though the story was fiction, it still felt that a similar situation could've occured. I also like the way Achebe never told you the time the story took place. The English missionaries could've been from 300 yrs. ago or they could've gone to Africa 2 yrs. ago. Overall the story was good."
2,"A BIT CONFUSNG AND ""OUT THERE""...","I was to read this book over the summer for a Social Studies Honors class. i am actually in the process of doing so at the moment. I think that the names of the characters get very confusing accept for the main character. after reading many of the different and unimportant names...you forget who is who. there are also many ""side stories"" within the story itself. little ""adventues"" that happe to other members of the tribe that have nothing to do with the plot. speaking of the plot...it is not very clear to me. i am about half way through and the book is basically aout nothing so far. all in all, only read this book if you like stories about culture...you have to read it....or you are really bored."
2,Not what it's cracked up to be,"The book is a bit boring and slow, too. By the time you see any trace of a continuous story line you will realize you're already more than half-way through the book. Prior that the text tells of several events which have no apparent relevance to the plot (an African tribesman returning from exile to find his clan being colonized by white men). The language is clever and the message is obvious, yet the story is not well constructed."
2,"Bad, Bad book","I am sorry, but this book is just plain horrible. there is no plot to speak of, the characters are bland and not very original and the style of writing nearly put me to sleep. If you want to read good african literature, read Cry the Beloved Country!"
2,So it does get better toward the end?,"I've read a number of Nigerian novelist and my favorite Nigerian writer is Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. Her ""Half of a Yellow Sun"" is excellent.And so when I saw that ""Things Fall Apart"" on a ""100 Best Books List"" (The Guardian) I decided to borrow it.It is very rarely that I don't finish a novel, but I despaired of this one and returned it when I was about 70% through.It was after this that I looked at the Amazon reviews. I might borrow it again as a few people have written that it gets OK towards the end.But for at least 70% it's all about a tribal strong man beating wives and killing a child. From other reviewers I gather that this is meant to show there WAS ""culture"" in Africa before the white men came?IF that was the novelists intent, all I can say is that it failed miserably."
4,Interesting!,"I think that this books interesting. It deals with the themes of cultural clashes and leadership. The writing was a little different because it follows the ways of the Ibo, there are lots of proverbs. Somethings that I didn't like were that the culture was very severe. Women were looked down upon but not the Oracle, they couldn't tap palm tree for the oil unless it was on the ground (the higher class of men) and the women were beaten and totally taken advantage of in my opinion. It was just a society full of contradictions. The ending was understandable. I have to admit that at first I was disappointed, however, after thinking about it for a little while I decided that the ending made sense and I don't think that another ending would have worked well in the end.This was definitely an interesting book."
2,its a sleeper thats for sure,"Pretty darn boring for first part, it gets a little better after the first 100 pages or so. Basically it starts out with ""Look! We have african culture! Isn't that great? Things got weird when the missionaries came. Feel guilty now if your ancesters were the kind that were involved in this, they destroyed it."" I refuse to participate in any more apologies for colonialism."
2,Things FELL apart,"I'm a teacher and wanted the students to hear the African names being pronounced correctly, so I went searching for a book on tape/CD. I had no idea the reader on the CD would be talking so very slow. A 5 page chapter (keeping in mind, the font in the book is probably a size 14) would take 30 minutes to listen to. I only played about half of a chapter for my students before I picked up the reading. It was ""okay"" in the fact where I could listen to the pronunciation of the names the night before, so that I could read it to my students. Next time I get a book on tape, I will sample it first. Now I have no use for a 6 disc book on CD. Maybe I'll try to sell it and get my money back."
4,A Jerry Springer Show of a Novel!!,"I am a high school senior and I feel that Cinua Achebe's ""Things Fall Apart is a very well written novel. I enjoyed it very much. I do feel that it has the content for a Jerry Springer Show!!! Lots of interesting turn of events, for Okonkwo, the major character"
4,Things Fall Apart review,Imperialism greatly harmed the Ibo people in the book Things Fall Apart. The Christians that came tried force the Ibo people to follow their religion and they were very arrogant. In one part of the book the Christians try to tell the Ibo people that their religion was totally wrong and that their own religion was the only right religion and they gave the people no choice of what religion they wanted to follow. But the Imperialists don't just disrespect their religion they also disrespected the people themselves when they just barged right into there villages and built the own churches and places to stay. It just seemed like the Ibo people were a lot more peaceful and happy before the imperialists arrived.
3,Things Fall Apart,"The book titled ""Things Fall Apart"" is an excellent book that combines the African stories with the qualities of the entire humanity. I read this book twice and it opened my mind, the first 4 chapters were boring but I didn't loose the interest. This book is definitely outstanding, my English teacher Ms. Nora Syran she recommended this book for it's quality messages to the reader and Im agree with her. I started reading this book over my spring break, while my friends were parting I was reading the coolest book I ever read. Okonkwo was a tragic character because he spent his entire life trying to be successful even with the bad reputation his father (Unoka) left to him, Okonkwo was outrageous he knew everything I admire him. I want to said that the book I just read was cool but it didn't satisfied my literature necessities. Anyway I love to read books like this one...END"
3,Over-rated but worthwhile,"A good book, but it reads like a rough draft for Achebe's ""Arrow of God,"" which is similar in important ways but vastly superior."
3,Good if into this stuff,"Kind of boring, but a lot of people I know who also read this book for class kind of liked it becaue it was unique. This book is also good if you are in the mood for a tradjedy (sp?)"
4,a real novel!,"Some reviewers have made comments that they did not like the first half/three-fourths of the book because it had no plot and it was mostly just cultural filler. That is true, except it serves perfectly as the basis of the form of a true NOVEL. The whole opening is to show you exactly how alien this culture is. It also paints one of the most richly drawn characters ever, Okonkwo, into a vast canvas full of tense customs. Everything is looking up for both the main character and the tribe, Umuofia (the second most important character). Then things just fall apart, hence the high arc of the story. I really liked the way this novel took everything like a grain of salt. So much happens, and yet it is all just tiny additions to Okonkwo's and the tribe of Umuofia's tragic life."
4,Book to be cherished,"This book contained so many values within it, whether it was family, religion, pride, or emotion. This book is excellent for a lesson on life as well as a history lesson. Read it!"
4,Starts a Little Slow,"This book was a required reading for one of my college history classes. It does start a little slow, but once it picks up, it is almost impossible to put down. As with ""The Clockwork Orange"", I wrote a little reference card on a notecard, just in case I forgot what one of the words the book used meant, I had my bookmark/notecard to look it up on."
3,Murally Depictive Narrative,"Imagine watching a slow slow slideshow of ancient or feudal african slide, while a very narrative voice of perhaps an old african man tells you the story as each slide slowly passes through. This is how it feels to read TFA. It gives a very interesting view of an African life. I would not say it can generalize African culture or living at all, but it does give you a secular view, revolving around the life of one man.This story, is more about one man in Africa while it simply shows Africa without focusing on it at all, except what is going on in Africa, and affecting the man.I reccomend it, especially for those who do not tend to read books in the African genre. It's an easy read and interesting. (And you'll have fun pronouncing the names as well). Enjoy!"
5,good book,"This book reads like a folk tale, however don't let the simple prose fool you, for like any good folk tale there many layers to be uncovered. This tale touches greatly upn such issues as family, and loyalty, and heritage, and pride and ignorance, and loss, all interwoven quite nicely."
4,"Intense, fascinating","Hello,Awhile back this was ""recommended"" to me by Amazon. I read the summary, it seemed interesting, and the price was right, so I ordered it. For about a year I tried to read it, but found I'd lose interest, leave it down, and end up coming back a few weeks later and starting all over again. Then about two weeks ago, I picked it up and couldn't put it down. Read it in two days. Must have been the right time because I found the story caught me. The writing pulled me in and made me forget that I was reading. That's always the best!As for the story, I was conflicted - I wanted to identify and support the tribal customs and lifestyle unconditionally. As a person born and raised in the U.S. I struggled with some of the tribe's cruel practices. Well, cruel by my sensibilities. Consequently I found myself a little pleased that some of the characters chose Anglican church beliefs and practices.Sincerely,SR"
5,A book everyone must read,"Chinua Achebe's THINGS FALL APART is like what HEART OF DARKNESS would have been if told through the eyes of an African. The book emerses the reader into the lives of an African village and soon one is lost in the world Achebe created. When the firt ""white man"" arrives, you feel the same shock, bewilderment, and later hatred that their arrival brings. It's like an earthquake that destroys everything that you know and love.This novel perfectly shows the disasterous effects of colonization and most readers will empathize with the struggles of the natives. This book should be required reading for everyone that agrees with invading another country to spread religion, democracy, values, or whatever else it believes it's doing in the name of righteousness."
4,Taught me a lesson,"I had to read this book for my 11th grade english class. This is not the book I wanted to read but when I actually got it I was pretty excited. Most of the time when I read a book and it changes me I can't pinpoint why. But this book changed me because it taught me a lesson. The 'hero' Okonkwo was a man ruled by fear, and this caused his life to end in disaster and suicide. The use of dramatic irony taught me that having your life ruled by anything will cause only bad in the end."
4,Things really do fall apart,"Things Fall Apart is aptly titled. The world is a changing place, and the ingrained customs of today may fade with your children even though they seem strong as you yourself carry them out.To be honest, I find the Ibo culture distasteful in many ways. These are perhaps modern sentimentalities, if not liberal or Christian ones. I am not going to commend this work as a scathing indictment of colonialism or as an exaltation of diversity. This story has deep roots in other ways for me. It reminds me a little of The Mists of Avalon, although a shorter and more Hemingway-esque version of it. Clearly this same story can be told in many ways across many cultures, and surely Christianity will suffer the same fate as Okonkwo and Morgaine's Gods.It all falls apart, eventually."
1,terrible,this was not in the right condition it said.It was very wrecked and not in good condition as I thought it would be
3,A book in progress,"The book written by Chinua Achebe is neither a glorious one nor a terrible one. Achebe says everything how it is, he is very straight forward. In no sense does he give you any time for imagination or self discovery, everything is there in plain and bold letters. Nothing is changed from the actual well being in Africa and Achebe portrays Africa in the way it is, not the way people in America see it. Achebe's main point is to get out the true Africa, instead of the one people think of it as. Things Fall Apart is one to read if you are secluded from the rest of the world in any way, shape or form. Not only are there characters that are very real in the book, but you become their companion in this long struggle against Ogbaje children, the Egwugwu, being banned from your own country and more."
2,2 stars for holding my attention,"Things Fall Apart is an interesting book, but I would not call it ground-breaking or legendary. While it gives a very interesting account of an African culture made obsolete after the appearance of Christian missionaries, it is hard to sympathize with Okonkwo, who cannot adjust to a culture that does not involve murdering twin newborns. Perhaps Achebe's flaw is his truthfulness; his brutal honesty in describing the culture led me to see Christianity's arrival in that land as a blessing."
2,Dragged on took forever to get through!,This book bored me out of my mind! of course when i read i cant stop in the middle of the book but i absolutly disliked the whole book but this is just my personal opinon i'm an odd one n e wayz!
1,Couldn't finish reading it - too painful and dull.,This book is too painful and boring to read period. I cannot believe that some people praise the language or sentence structure.
1,Where is the plot?,"Whilst the novel lacks a good storyline for such unique cultural and traditional content, it sends a powerful message for their colonizer. From historical and cultural perspective, the book rebelliously claims that they have an abundantly well-respected culture even before they were colonized and the new government didn't affect these people--but it actually did. Yet, it doesn't deny the power of the colonizers despite the dweller's rebel.Aside from the message it held, the novel is pretty boring and bland and sexist. It doesn't have an interesting plot to follow. It is a bunch of information about the tribe's culture, ritual, historical background, the colonization process and dweller's reaction to this movement. However it delivers a certain message: when something better comes along, (some) people would take advantage of it even if it means to leave their tribe or custom. Above all, the good news is that the main character fought for what he believed till death."
1,It was very boring,Throught the book the auther keeps bringing in new charecters that have almost the identicle spelling of another and it gets very confusing
1,print,"The quality of the print for the novel is poor, compared to the one i studied back in my secondary school days.I,m not happy with the purchase,but will manage to read it like that."
2,Erm....,"I absolutely HATED reading this book. I respect it as a very popular piece of literature, but in truth I spent more time sounding out all of the names in this then actually reading it!"
4,I have not had time to read it yet.,This is one of many books that I have wanted to be a part of my little library. So I will not be reviewing it at the present time.
4,Damn Good!,Just read it! Its a very surprising and interesting book. It points you in a different veiw. its Danm Good.
5,A Book To Learn About Other Cultures,"I read this book for a class assignment. I am in high school. It was one of the best book I ever read. I enjoyed reading about other cultures. I learned about how are the marriage set up, eating eggs may be temping for one to steal eggs, the way the culture answer the door and a lot of other things. For part one of the book, it explain about the life of Okonkwo. Things like if a man shows their feeling, that was a sign of weakness. There are not much action in part one, but starting in part two it got a little more action. I was so surprise with the ending of the book. There should be a part two to, ""Things Fall Apart""."
4,Things fall Apart- an in depth study of African culture,"The most appealing quality about Things fall apart is how Achebe cleverly parallels the main plots, the demise of Okonkwo and also of the village, to the extent that they are almost interchangable and so a decline in the traditional way of life accounts a deterioration in Okonkwo and vice versa. Written in response to Joseph Conrad's Heart of darkness, Things fall apart is simply a brilliant novel which leaves the reader with an appreciation of African culture, (which like any other has established festivals, hierachies-based on achievement, gods, customs) regardless of time and place and in doing so disposes of the stereotypical view of African tribes and customs as being backward."
4,love-hate relationship with Things Fall Apart,"This was the first book I have ever read that I was both bored with and inexplicably drawn to. The wonderfully elegant, eloquent prose completely blew me away; it was stunning. The beginning was, for lack of a better word, rather discombobulated, and the reader begins to develop a very complex relationship with Okonkwo. This book, in my opinion, is completely worth reading for the last page, one of the best I've read. I found the book dry at times, though- bear with it."
4,Very Interesting!,"I am a sophomore in college and was assigned this book to do a short review. At first, like many books I've read in the past, it started out very dull. After getting through the first four chapters, the book started to become more interesting. This is a story about real life, although in another culture. It touched me in so many ways. I would suggest this book to any scholar!"
4,Squirrels Are Evil.,"In this story, Shrek tells Donkey and Fiona about the time that he tried to save a town of angry villagers from the ransacking havoc of a masked band of villainous squirrels. The squirrels have been stealing every thing from frying pans to anvils and storing it in a secret cave. Shrek finds out about the cave, but keeps forgetting the secret password, ""Open ..."" a grain that sounds like centipede.I found this story to be very entertaining. It's quite short and can be read within 30 minutes or less. I've never really liked squirrels much--everyone knows they are secretly plotting to take over the world--and I bought this book because it showed the small furry woodland creatures in their true light, as sneaky little vermin."
5,Ditto!,"I teach dance in the public schools, and have read this book to thousands of children. Everyone loves this book!!""Dance is a way of talking too, because a dance can say anything....."""
2,Cheap product,"A friend of mine bought this set for our Memorial Day picnic. We played two games with it and two of the mallets are now broken. Both broke when someone tried to knock somebody else's ball far away, but this is a normal tactic in croquet so it wasn't really excesive usage. In fact, one of the people who ended up breaking a mallet was a 9 year old kid, so it didn't take that much strength. The handles are made from a very light wood, and they were brave enough to cut ridges into the handles that weaken the material even more.This is a fine set if you don't want to spend that much and a bunch of beginers are going to use it and not be that aggressive, but if you're serious about a croquet set, spend a little more to get something that can hold up to the sport."
2,ok for a cheap game,"The set is not really full sized, in that the mallets are short; however, adults can still use them, and small children can also. The balls are lighter weight and so don't roll well in grass. One of the mallet sticks was too small and so would not stay screwed in to the mallet head and had to be glued. For a family outing where you don't really care about the game but just want something cheap and portable, the set is fine. The price was certainly right."
2,not for adults,"I was unable to tell by looking at this online, but it is a very small set and more appropriate for children than adults. It would give an adult a backache to try to play a full game. We had to return it. It did look like a nice set, if shopping for a child."
2,my choice error,"I purchased this item from the description and picture, and it's ok. We have not used it yet, but it is really to small for adults, (probably good for kids though). If I had it to do over I would probably have spent more and got a better, (and larger) set.M Ayers"
2,Low Quality,"We received this item as a gift and sent it back after putting together. While screwing together the mallets, we heard wood cracking sounds. The paint job was poor and it just seemed low quality. We thought better to return before actually using and having it break. Buy a better quality set."
3,Low Quality,"I played two games with this set and broke one mallet. Another mallet had trouble screwing the head on to the stick. The arches are ok, but the mallets just feel like they will break."
2,Disappointed in carrying case,"I was excited when I read that the set came with a ""Deluxe Carrying Case"", but when the item arrived, I soon became disappointed. The case is really nice, but when I screwed the mallets & the handles together, they no longer fit in the case! I can fit two (layed on opposite sides) with the handles sticking out of the case. I can't zip it shut, but can close the Velcro on the top, I wanted to be able to carry all of them! If I wanted to carry all the mallets in the case & zip it closed, I would have to unscrew the mallets from the handles each time after using them, then I would have to worry about stripping the handles. What a bother that would be!We did use them & I agree for the price, the set will do, but next time when designing the case, take the someone should take the length into account please! That was misleading advertising to say it came with a ""Deluxe Carrying Case"" when it can't even be used properly!"
3,Croquet Sixpack,The set arrived in it's own carrying case and in good condition. The six mallets and the stakes are made from a good quality hardwood and the set includes all items necessary to play a rousing game of croquet. The balls are a bit small based on my memory of other sets I have used but are certainly playable. Time will tell about the durability of the items but summer will certainly include several challenging games of croquet in this household.
3,great garden game,My son wanted to get this game. We have been pleased with it. Holds up well to alot of children playing
3,cheap junk,"once the mallets are assembled,they won't fit in the storage bag and the whole thing is of poor quality. China?"
3,Quality Not Great,My husband loves to play croquet and has literally worn out our old set. I bought this since it had received very good reviews. Personally I think it looks cheap...the paint is poorly done and the balls are smaller than the last set we had. My husband seems satisfied with it though!
3,Not as sturdy as the set i grew up playing,"At my grandparents house in the summers growing up we would play croquet very often. The sticks felt good and sturdy, the wickets didn't bend too easily and the balls were heavier.This set ships as described, but the quality just feels like they took every shortcut possible. INCREASE PROFITS. CUT COSTS. MAKE THE STICKS THIN SO THEY BREAK EASIER AND WILL NEED TO BE REPLACED....The set isn't so bad that i'll return them.If you're looking for a cheap set to satisfy a camping trip or something short-term, then this set is for you.If you've bought a house with a nice lawn and plan to have friends and family over to play croquet for years and years of outdoor entertainment, this set is not for you."
2,Missing parts,"I ordered this set to arrive in time for a tea party I was throwing for my daughter. It arrived the day before the party, but was missing the 2 stakes. I did not have time to return/exchange it before the party, and was extremely disappointed with oversight in packaging. Now that I have time to deal with this, I find out my return window has expired and would have had to pay out of pocket shipping fees! Very frustrating...."
2,Breaks too easy,The balls are good. The wire hoops are fine. But the mallets break too easily. Several of mine broke from normal use. Pay more somewhere else and get something that won't splinter.
4,Pretty much the Real Thing Live,"But that doesn't make it any less good. The Real Thing is one of my favorite albums of all time, so these live tracks certainly are enjoyable. The dvd is even better, they put on a sick show, it also includes ""As the Worm Turns"" and ""Underwater Love"". What really got me on this cd was ""The Cowboy Song"". I was hungry for more Real Thing-era FNM and this song is definately in the same vein, it should have been on the Real Thing. It's catchy and epic at the same time. One of my favorite FNM songs. I spent $12 and it was all worth it for ""The Cowboy Song"", the live stuff just added."
4,"a fine ""Anything Goes"" with the late Eileen Rodgers","This 1962 off-Broadway revival of ANYTHING GOES was a huge success, enjoying a year-long run in Manhattan and later reopening in Las Vegas.Eileen Rodgers makes for an excellent, sultry Reno Sweeney, the singing chaunteuse-turned evangelist, with Hal Linden in fine form as Billy Crocker. Margery Gray (TOVARICH) is a delight as Bonnie. Also in the talented cast are Mickey Deems, Kenneth Mars, Mildred Chandler and Barbara Lang.Eileen Rodgers, who died only a few months ago (as of this review's writing) is a superb Reno, belting out the immortal Cole Porter standards ""Anything Goes"", ""Blow, Gabriel, Blow"" and ""I Get a Kick Out of You"".Highly-recommended."
5,Brilliant and flawless casting,"Eileen Rodgers absolutely OWNS Reno Sweeney in this 1962 Off-Broadway revival, boasting a sexy and smoky voice that comes across as natural, sounding like a woman who's had her share of cigarettes, smokes, and men and lives to tell about it. Her rousing renditions of ""I Get A Kick Out Of You"" and ""Anything Goes"" are sheer joy and transport the listener to a cabaret lounge in Manhattan. The production is thankfully simple, with bare-bones orchestration, making it very different from jazzy and polished recording from the 1988 Patti Lupone revival (which is equally brilliant in its own right)."
4,Puzzled,"This CD is great and does exactly what it sets out to do. What puzzles me is the comment recorded here by 'basspoaune' about the 1987 recording of this show. S/he states:""The 1987 version has many added songs, not even composed by Porter, most of which aren't even slightly in his style.""I'd be interested to know which songs s/he believes are not by Porter and not 'even slightly in his style'. He wrote them all, and as any true Porter fan knows, he didn't have a 'style' but a wide variety of styles, as you would expect from a composer whose career spanned half a century."
5,it's delovely,"this is so wonderful! the vocals are incredible, especially Hal Linden! i'm a teenager and you'd think that this isn't the kind of music a ""typical teenager"" listens to but i do! this show is the epitome of musical theater, in my opinion :)"
5,Best Version of this Music,"I listened to some of the clips from the 1987 revival album and was appalled. I know there is a lot of debate over which version of ""Anything Goes"" is the ""real, original"" version but in my opinion this is the definitive recording of the show. All of the singing and orchestration is just dead on. I was lucky enough to be in the show over this past summer as the purser (the captain's second-in-command) and I have to say singing and dancing in all of the big numbers was so much fun. I love listening to this album and remembering how much fun it was to be in the show. This is the best version of ""Anything Goes"" available. Even though it was recorded quite a while ago it still sounds incredibly fresh and modern."
3,"Smooth ""Anything""","I currently own the 1988 Studio recording and this recording of Anything goes. While they are two different musicals (1988's Cast does the ""original"" Anything Goes, and this CD is the revamped version) this CD is more enjoyable than the other. Mainly because all the voices are smoother, and nicer to the ear. Both CDs have tracks that the other does not, but the story lines are pretty similar. The 1988 recording seems to have a much bigger ensemble feel to it, with huge company numbers, while this one has many more character ballads. Of course I would suggest getting both, but if you had to choose one, I would pick this one. I would suggest this for people who like Broadway, but aren't brand new to it. Its not too old, nor too new, so its just right. Favorite Song: ""Anything Goes"""
3,Fun...but not wonderful,"I own the CD and I have been in the show twice, and like I said above it is a light and fun show but I wouldn't give it 5 stars. If you like the older broadway sound of music without a lot of drama this is probibly the show for you, if not I would look into other soundtracks. There are a few favorites of mine such as ""Heaven Hop"" and ""Friendship""."
4,Tribute to the master,"Mark O'Connor headlined the Sunday night Strawberry Music Festival fall of 2001 and performed a very similar concert to what is captured on this disc, a tribute to the late Stephane Grappelli. It was a memorable performance and may have seemed original and inspired to listeners getting their introduction to swing jazz. Not that many years ago, however, I was fortunate to hear Stephane Grappelli and Bucky Pizzarelli play outside at Villa Montalvo. There's a huge difference between the young O'Connor and the (now deceased) old Grappelli. I suspect those with a recording or two of Stephane's will feel slightly disappointed with this. Perhaps it's the lack of O'Connor's use of the high harmonic that was a trademark of Stephane's style, or maybe it's my judgement that this album is trying to be someone else's, but there's something that misses. However, if you don't make the comparison, the album sounds pretty good, almost too clean for a live recording."
1,An Incomplete Story,"I had purchased this version of Marlowe's work because it was convenient at the time. While I thought it was a good story, it was also heavily edited. It did spur my desier to find the original A and B texts of the play, and now that I have read the more complete version I feel that this particular revision actually cheats the reader of the true depth of the play and the fall of Faustus. Many scenes from the original, such as the knight's plot of revenge, were removed. The author claimed such cuts were made for the sake of a more 'performable' play, which may be true, but in this, and other instances, I felt the material cut was crucial to filling out the plot and improving character develop throughout the story. I read both versions with a directors eye, and I would urge anyone considering this purchase to look for 'The Complete Plays' instead."
2,Poorly produced item,"I realy like Karen Valentine, and was glad to see this available, however, this release is poor quality. Soft and contrasty. There is quite a bit of tearing in the screen durring bright scenes. (week sync signal and out of adjustment) Absolutely no effort was taken to make this a decent product. It looks like an amature transfered it using a very cheap comercial machine with a 3rd generation copy."
3,A Farrah Fan's View,The movie must have been re-released after the Farrah explosion as it lists her in a star role but she is actually in the film all of 3 minutes. LOL! The movie itself is way too cutesy for me & very unrealistic- but the 70's clothes & styles are fun to watch.
3,Good performances of decent but not very memorable music,"The works featured on this disc stem from Goldmark's early mature period. They are rather conventional four-movemented work, and despite the obvious craftsmanship and some interesting melodic ideas, rather rambling and even dull at times. The slow movements of both works are the only ones that really reward concentrated focus throughout, with some quite nice rather autumnal melodies, but on total I am reluctant to give the music any unreserved recommendation.The Lajtha Quartet acquits themselves well and serves up what I believe would be the best possible case for this music - if you know that you want these works, you won't go wrong with these accounts (apparently, the competing version from the Fourth Dimension Quartet on ASV has received very good reviews, but I haven't heard it). Whatever shortcomings there are, they are shortcomings of the music. In sum, I'd say this release is worthwhile, but mainly for the specialist."
1,Small and easy to damage,"I ordered this for my one year old thinking a wooden toy would be ""cuter"" than the standard plastic stacking rings. The size of this is considerable smaller than any others I'd seen. My son puts everything in his mouth so the stacked center had to be shelved immediately. I didn't want him to impale himself on the slim dowel! He liked to crawl around with the little rings, they were a good size for chubby little hands...but then the paint started chipping off the rings. So that's one toy I trashed already!"
1,Unsafe!,"We got this stacker set with the intent to help my son start with the rings. I liked the idea that the rings were wooden and could be stacked in any order, but he wanted to put the base in his mouth. The base is a dowel rod stuck into a wooden base. If he were to put it in his mouth and fall he would be severely injured so I remove the base and we only play with the rings in a fashion similar to hockey pucks or other flat blocks."
2,Good Toy Except Paint Chips Off,"I purchased this toy 7 months ago. My daughter is 18 months old and isn't rough with this toy but the paint is chipping off of the rings. I expected the quality to be better. I really like the toy and my daughter loves it. I was surprised how quickly she learned to get the rings on the pole with how small the holes are, it seems like a good toy to help develop fine motor skills. This is a great classic toy I am just unhappy with the paint. Wish I would have gone with another brand."
3,good but heavy and not graduated,"prefer the plastic one b/c my little one hit me and herself with the heavy base. though perhaps bc she is only 1y/o and this toy is not rec until older?the plastic one is graduated, so you can't put them on in the wrong order. but this allows you to put on in any order. so hard to learn which order, I think.."
2,small,"Let me start by saying, I love Melissa & Doug products and my son has many wonderful toys from their line...but, I purchased this toy for my best friend's child and when I received it I discovered that this toy stacker is significantly smaller than plastic versions and after a short debate with myself I decided that it wasn't safe for a wobbly toddler, in case she fell over on it or something. For this toy I personally prefer the plastic version."
1,Poor quality for Melissa and Doug,"The stand came apart with in a week. Purple ring's hole is too small and needs to be forced down the stick, and the orange and yellow are the same size...I complained and was told to ship it back at my own expense...which works out to be more than I paid for the stacking rings. Sadly I am NOT happy with the product or the seller. Normally I am a big Melissa and Doug fan."
1,Do not purchase,"I'm just repeating what others have said here, but wanted to add to the list of reviews. Yes, we have had this toy for only a few days and already the paint is chipping and peeling off: quite a disappointment. I thought it was nice at first, but I'm sure there are much better options out there."
3,Quality Product but Hazardous,"It is a good quality toy on par with what Melissa and Doug have to offer. However, be aware that the center piece is a flat top dowel rod stuck into the base. My little boy would rather run around with this ""stick"" part in his hand or his mouth and risk impailing himself than sit and stack. Do not let your child play with this toy unsupervised!"
2,Paint chipping off,My son really enjoys this toy but I recently noticed him chewing on one of the rings and flakes of orange color in his mouth. The color on the ring was chipping off in large chunks.It may just be a defective toy we got but just wanted to put that warning out there.
2,Choking hazard,"Like all Melissa and Doug toys, this is beautiful and well-made. My 13-month old son loves stacking and shape sorting, and plays all the time with the Fisher-Price plastic version of this. He received this as a birthday gift and we were really excited......until he promptly popped the top blue ring into his mouth and started zooming around the house. I don't think it is big enough to swallow ordinarily, but if he were to fall I think it could become lodged in his throat and would be very hard to grasp to remove as the edges are all very smooth. We tried just taking that ring out of the set and putting it up, but then he did the same thing with the top red ball so we have put the whole toy away. Bummer."
3,Not for younger babies,We purchased this toy for our daughter on her first birthday. She had been walking for about three weeks but with this toy she wasn't as interested in stacking the rings on it as walking around with it in her hand or her mouth. We were(are) worried about her falling on it so we've left only the rings and the top ball out for her to play with. Its a cool toy but she's not ready for it yet.
2,Educational but dangerous.,My son loves stacker and sorters. Nothing but good ol' fashion toys that require thinking and development but the base is dangerous. It can puncture and requires supervision. We had no problems with the size of the rings or the paint but it seemed dangerous. We ended up sticking to the Fisher-Price stacker and cup stackers even though my son was as interested in them (this makes noise).
2,I worry about the stick!,"Once all the stackable parts are removed, what's left is a narrow stick. We worried about her falling on it since she's just learning how to stand and walk, and also about her shoving it into her mouth or eye. For now we'll keep it on the shelf until she's a little older.The cats love the colored disks and enjoyed batting them under the furniture. ;-)"
3,Lots of fun BUT paint bubbles and chips,"My son received this stacker as a Christmas gift at 18 mos old. He loves playing with it and it has helped us teach him colors. HOWEVER, within the first few weeks the paint on the red ball topper began to bubble and chip off. So badly so that I won't let my son have it. The paint has also started to chip off some of the rings from normal use (he is very gentle when playing with it). While my son has a lot of fun with this toy, I am very disappointed in the quality. His Melissa and Doug jumbo peg puzzles seem to be holding up much better. I have written to the company about this issue and asked for a replacement."
3,Surprised,The stackable is Nice but was upset that it was scaled way down to what the Normal size used to be.Easier for a baby if the pieces could still be wooded but the normal size. I would Never order this SIZE again
2,Tiny,"This is very little and cannot see my child playing with it. I bought it more for decore, which it does look cute. So I am happy with it for those reasons."
3,Good educational toy,This is a good educational toy. I bought it for my 9 month old granddaughter though she was not too interested in it yet. Probably better for 1 year old. The toy was smaller than I thought it would be.
4,Fun toy!,"My daughter loves to play with the rings, but especially the ball on top. It is colorful and she loves it!"
1,Avoid,This book is complete waste of money. Even if you were given money to take this book it would be a waste. Because this book in no means helps you at all. The author who wrote the book does not use it in his own class. Only requires you to buy it but then never uses it in class.
1,Here we go again...,"Greedbag douchebucket Gene is at it again, spewing his opinion around like so much vomit all over the collective consciousness. This man is so proud of himself it's almost hilarius. When he finally croaks out (if he ever does) I hope they remove the internal organs and stuff the cavity full of hundred dollar bills and put him on display somewhere. Maybe a KISS convention? His corpse could make money for him long after he's dead."
4,"Funny, informative and precise","This book has a lot of information in it. It also tells you exactly how to make most of the items, how it works, and how to apply it"
3,"Computer is fine, however the readout of time is too small","In general it is a good product. I gave it 3 stars because the readout is rather small (for older users like me). Also, the installation on the handlebar could be a more secure by having a more robust attaching straps so it could be tightened much more."
4,Good bike computer.,The computer is really good and installs quite easily. The only problem is the setting instructions for the functions (In 11 languages). They are not very good (As noted in another review I read).
5,Cateye Rocks!,"I have had several Cateye bike computers and highly recommend this brand. I like the functions on the Mity 8, and it is easy to use once you have it set up. I will say that the instructions with Cateye products are really bad, the sheet has 8 or 10 different languages on it, and the diagrams don't make much sense, so it can be frustrating to wade through them. But once you get it set up the product is great!"
4,Compelling,"Making history readable, relate-able, is quite a gift. In this case, this was a piece of history I knew nothing about, and found it fascinating. Descriptive and visionary."
3,"Half of a short, sweet read","Having recently read Dove Keepers I was eager for another long tale from Alice Hoffman. The prose in this story was interestingly written and pulled me in right away. I was just really getting in to what was happening to Estrella, when my Kindlw all of a sudden flashes a %99 done message. I guess that being left hanging, wanting more is a sign of a good story, but this was disappointingly short. Just when you really start to get involved in the main character's life, the story ends. I checked back to see what I had paid for this book, felt like I got a lot less read than I paid for. I will try another Alice Hoffman book with hopes that it isn't so short."
3,More of a History Lesson,"I love Alice Hoffman. Her writing style is addictive! This book was a quick read, but not as memerable as many of her others. This was more of a quick history of the persecution of the Jews. While interesting and touching, I felt myself wanting for more when I finished the last page... like the book wasn't quite finished. Not Hoffman's best book, but an interesting read."
4,beautiful and powerful voice to a sadly familliar tale,"Estrella's world is turning upside down: her best friend hates her, she has fallen in love with the neighbor, and the Jewish people of her town are being horrifically persecuted. Then she makes a shocking discovery: her family is Jewish. Hoffman's tale is beautifully described, like poetry and magic and tragedy in one, with a moving and powerful voice. Grade: B+"
4,granddaughter,"i got this book for my grandaughter for christmas she loved it ,said it remindered her of ann frank. of course i read it too .good little book."
3,Incarnation,"I ordered this Kindle book for my wife and she enjoyed it. It was my first Kindle book purchase and it was was quite easy to download utilizing the Amazon download procedure. It was quite fast for this book, only a few seconds. I would recommend this method of purchase."
5,Incantation,So well written! It evokes a sense of those times and gives the reader a peek into the lives and emotions of those who were forced to live as hidden Jews.
2,Not a balanced view of the Inquisition,"A scholarly study published in 2004 found that, during the Inquisition, ""Torture was rare and only about 1 percent of those brought before the Spanish Inquisition were actually executed.""There may have been situations like the burning of 50 citizens in the town square, but they will have been rare.While I am a fan of Alice Hoffman's magical realism, this is not a book that I would recommend for an impressionable teen. It portrays every Christian in the story, except for the heroine's boyfriend, as rabid, hate-filled sadists. It's equivalent to portraying every German during WW II as sadistic murderers, which we know is not accurate. This is an extremely unbalanced view.A high point of the story is the heroine's bitter denunciation of the priest who has failed to protect the Jews in his church.Considering that Christianity is the last minority that intellectuals in the US now feel justified in attacking, I would not give this to a teen."
5,Intense!,"That was intense! The beautiful art work of the cover caught my eye as well as the summary stating that it was a story of the Spanish Inquisition of which I knew little about. The book did not disappoint as it gave me many different topics and ideas to ponder. (Not to mention the desire to do more researching about the time period.) Great book -- it is graphic and may not be for younger audiences, but the events need to be told, and they are told in a sensitive not sensationalistic way."
4,Almost Perfect,"Without a doubt, Scott Slapin is an amazing violist. His transcription of Bach's Sonatas and Partitas are magnificent. The fuller tone of the viola plays well with these violin pieces. Although Slapin maintains a good tone throughout all the pieces, there are many areas where you can hear him strike other strings when crossing to another string. I often overlook these minor details simply because Mr. Slapin plays with great passion, and this is one of the only viola transcriptions of the Sonatas and Partitas that can be found."
5,Making pieced curves simple,Very informative and easy to follow directions. Makes you want to start immediately to make a quilt.
4,Very informative but expensive,"This is a good book not only for the beginners but also for advanced quilters. It will give you a few original quilting ideas with original designs. I found the chapter or color/light theory very informative and useful. On the negative site I found the book rather expensive which prvents me from giving it five stars. Amazon discount is certainly very helpful...If you liked this book, I suggest to also check out:Coloring With Thread: A No-Drawing Approach To Free-Motion EmbroideryThread Calligraphy By Nancy Kazlauckas"
5,So simple is right,"This book is great! I saw Dale Fleming demonstrate her technique on a quilting show & I had to have her book. It's so easy! The first quilt I ever made was a photo quilt for my parents 50th anniversary. I was scared to start, but, this book made it so easy! The pictures of our family history look like they have been beautifully framed, thanks to the ""six minute circle"". Even if you just learn the ""six minute circle"" this book is well worth the money!"
5,soft and comfy,I've had this for over a year now. The color stays true after repeated washing and the fabric hasn't pilled like other flannels that I've seen.
5,PERFECT!!,LOVE LOVE LOVE this gate!!! It's perfect for the top of my stairs. It IS loud IF you don't hold down the button when retracting the gate.
3,For Adults Only,"I purchased this gate because I wanted one that would ""disappear"" at night. I didn't want to keep running into it. This does that but when it retracts it sometimes wrinkles and and I have to keep adjusting it to retract properly. Also, already after a month the locking mechanism has separated from the soft gate. So far it is easy to put back in place but it does not bode well for years of use. Also, the big drawback is that it really is difficult. My five-year-old CANNOT use it and so must have us lift him over all the time. Nor can any other adult figure it out if they have not read the directions. It took us a few times reading them to get the hang of it too. So, if you want a gate and have older children you might want something easier to open and close."
4,Works,"The gate works but is comber some when trying to open it. Must use both hands to open it. Works great for large openings but was hard to install. Had to do some modifying to get it up. Has pulled away from the wall where the drywall is because of the force of the pressure and my 2 year old likes to bang against it. Little pricy but it worked at the bottom of my stairs, when no other gate would. Great space saver too!"
3,gate,"it's some what hard to operate, opening and closing... but it does fit our space that needed a gate."
4,"A little difficult to operate, but works well.","We have this gate mounted on a 48 inch opening into a kiddie room and that width makes it harder to operate. There are many curse words muttered under the breath while trying to latch the thing sometimes.The design is such that you have to keep one hand on the base while pushing a sliding button and pressing it down. So you have one hand 4 feet to one side while trying to stretch the mesh across the door and latching it on the other side one-handed.Once latched, it works well.As others have mentioned, it is NOISY also - making a loud ratcheting sounds when you open or close the gate.It works sort of like a window shade laid sideways.Overall, it is a good product with a few flaws and hassles."
3,Good choice if swing gate not an option,"We got this gate for the top of the stairs since a swing gate would have blocked access to our son's room. It was difficult to install even with the wall installation kit and my husband had to go out and buy additional screws that were longer. Now that it is installed, it works fine, but is not particularly easy to use, especially with one hand. It is noisy when it retracts unless you hold the unlock button down, so that can be annoying. It's also hard to latch- I always miss the bottom attachment and then I have to unlock and start over. But, it keep our son from getting near the stairs and we were able to install it at a slight angle which you can't do with most other gates. So it was probably the best option for our house although I think it is kind of pricey for what you get. It is nice that it is not in the way when it's open and that even the part that is visible pretty much blends into the wall."
4,"Just installed, seems like the best option....",".......after reviewing and seeing all other types. I had the worst situation, hallow wall on one side, iron railing on the other side, so had to get adapters for both sides. To my surprise, the iron railing side was more easy to attach. My railing is 2 inch each side squares, so to let people out there that have the same railings the adapter works. (see attached pics)The hallow wall side took some adjustments and I had to do it twice, so I had to get other toggle bolts.The instructions is the main reason I am not giving 5 stars. One the print is so small. And in my opinion the wording and pictures is just not clear.Yes the locking system can be a little tricky but its not impossible and as hard as I see others write about. Like everything else its a matter of getting used to.The cost it seems like the most expensive one out there. But since I think its the best and its for the protection of my son, then cost does not matter."
4,decent gate,"Length:: 1:46 MinsWhen I was looking for gates, I thought a video would have helped see if this gate would work for us. So hopefully this will help you. In general I like it. The lock is tricky and it is loud. But, I guess that's the price to pay for having a gate that doesn't get in the way when the baby's sleeping or not in the house. It was not easy for us to install. But our railings are abnormal and so any gate would have given us trouble."
3,Pretty Good,"This gate seems sturdy enough and is what I was looking for. The installation was difficult because you have to have the gate expanded to bolt it to the wall, but you can't keep the gate expanded without someone else holding it. It's also not very practical to say that this gate can be opened or closed one handed. The locking/unlocking mechanism works, but is more complicated than most other child gates and more complicated than it needs to be. Retracting screen is also very loud and to make it close quietly, you HAVE to use two hands.PS: If you need to attach it to a hollow wall or to a banister, you can buy cheaper modification kits than what is recommended for this gate. The Kidco Gate Installation Kit works great and is cheaper."
4,Nice looking gate,"This is defintely the best looking gate around. We have it right by our front entrance and love how it disappears when we don't need it, and it even looks nice when it is out. It was very easy to install, but it's not as easy to use. There is no way my 9 month old is ever going to be able to climb this or get out, but it's difficult for me to open or close with her in my arms. It is also noisy if you open it one handed. For a location where you don't have room for a swing out gate, this is the best option."
3,"Great idea, needs revision","This is a great idea; a child gate that rolls up and is easy to deploy and retract and mounts in a wide varity of openings. And, once installed, the gate does work very well and seems strudy.However, the unit is NOT designed to be installed with a baseboard or corner round and if thoes are present you have to purchase a rather costly adaptor set which addresses the baseboard but not the corner round. For that you need to use a bit creative instalation and use parts from the kit to 'make it work'. For over $100 each I would expect a better designed unit.That said, we do like these and if you are OK with the complex install or don't have the baseboard/corner round issues this is the only product of its type that I know of."
4,Excellent Collection of Ragas,"There is very little appreciation for the raga or for Indian music in general here in the West. If you listen to this CD, you'll understand why that's a shame. These ragas are compelling and meditative at the same time. If you want to test-drive this disc, visit the Ragmala site (I'd put the link here, but Amazon'll just remove it). You can hear a sampling of the material. Trust me, if you're a fan of the Indian classical form, you will enjoy this CD."
3,Everything but the tray!,"I like this highchair becuase it is easy to clean. You don't realize how great that vinyl seat is until you use another one that has a fabirc seat...yuck. It is very adjustable too.The main (and big) drawback is that the tray seems cheap and flimsy when attached to the highchair. It wiggles around and just attaches very, very poorly. It is very difficult to put the tray on in the first place, and when it is on you wonder if you've done it right because it is so insecure. The tray does NOT slide onto two rails - it just somehow clips on.Also, I'd appreciate more neutral, less ""playful"" prints and colors, since this does sit out in the home every day.My Baby Trend highchair seems a million times more stable and better built."
4,One of the better things I have bought,"I bought this chair when my daughter was about 5 months old, and has loved it ever since.I like the fact that it is easy to clean up and that it has a handy wipes holder on the back. It's great to have that especailly since she likes to make a mess sometimes. It wheels easily through our house, so I can take it from the kitchen to the living room without a problem.. The extra little toy on the side is a great addition to an already great product. I like that I can lean her back so she can take a bottle on her own. The sest cover also makes for easy clean up. Th only draw back I feel is that when you fold it up, it does not stay put. But other than that I am very satisfied with this product."
5,A must for both experienced and aspiring teachers,"This was one of three required texts for my masters level Adv. Language Arts class. At first, I thought that the book would follow the pathway of others dealing with education in urban schools--focus on the ""Great White Hope"". Although the author is Caucasian and the majority of her students are minorities, the book didn't come off as a ""Made in Hollywood"" story. Christensen is completely honest in her sharing of students' attitudes, experiences, beliefs, and achievemnets as well as her own. She is explicit in her teaching methods, and openly shares what works and what doesn't. It is impossible for me to give Christensen the credit that she deserves in such a limited space. However, I encourage you to discover her on your own. Happy reading."
2,Not what I expected in a text book for education,"I had expected this text to be a collection of teaching ideas and suggestions for students preparing to teach language arts in school. There are some useful ideas for educational majors. There is also a ton of unuseful, uninsightful and personal ramblings of an apparent devout feminist who obliviously would more comfortable wrting about societies ills with men in charge, instead of useful educational ideas. Writer Christensen should write social commentaries, instead of professing to write useful text, when she can spew extreme left wing ideas. This should have been a book for a sociology class, not an education class."
3,Partisan from the opening Introduction,"With a New York Times Author writing the introduction, it takes away from the actual reports. The liberal paper of New York of course will put its spin on this one. Skip the intro and read the facts, which are also easily accessible at the 9/11 commission website. Everything contained in here is available for free on their website. This is also not the actual report of the commission but transcripts of the hearings."
5,Soothing,"This is truly a soothing and relaxing CD. I use this CD in my classroom as background music. It helps to calm my students, and me. My students enjoy JMG's style of music and selection of songs."
1,A major lack in creativity! For a solo piano album.,"I am really blown away by the lack of creativity that this album has. John Michael Gray just took all of the classics and bunched them together to try to sell some albums (it seems to me). I would like to know who couldn't make an album like this? And it is really to simple for me, I love all types of solo piano but I think he is lacking seriously in the skill department. Sorry about this review but c'mon John write your own songs. I wouldn't by this album and I don't know anyone who would. Jeremy Enigk (solo piano fan)"
1,Worst DVD quality ever. Period.,"The quality of this disc is so bad it's almost unbelievable. The sound is akin to a cat attempting free noise jazz on a knockoff electric guitar, and the picture was cobbled together using pixels the size of olives. There's better releases of this movie, including the double-feature DVD listed above. If you buy this it will be the worst DVD purchase of your life."
4,A great collection for any Pokemon music fan,"Another nice collection of Japanese Pokemon Music. Included with the CD is a clear soft vinyl CD carrying case with a black strap. One or two CD jewel cases would fit. All the tracks on this CD are new from the first 'Best Collection,' though most have been on other Japanese Pokemon CDs. The tracks are: 1. OK!, 2. Pokemon Ieru ka neo? 3. Nyarth no Party, 4. Tankentai wo Tsukurou, 5. Type: Wild, 6. Lapras ni Notte, 7. Takeshi no Paradise, 8. Soratobu Pokemon Kids, 9. toi et moi, 10. Pokemon Harahara Relay, 11. Pichu-Pika Swing, 12. Niji ga Umareta Hi, 13. Rival!, 14. Bokura Pichu-Pichu Brothers!, 15. Tomodachi Kinenbi, 16. Boku no Best Friend. All the tracks are in Japanese."
5,this was the better album of the two...,"Not like there is too much commotion over the Mondays stateside, but the reviewer that said ""perhaps the best Happy Mondays album"" and only gave the record three stars is an idiot. Pills & Thrills is at least four stars in my book (amg gave it five which is a rare thing). Bummed is raw, and less produced - just the way I like my music to sound. More importantly, Ryder sings as if he is mocking himself at times - sometimes he sounds out of tune....it's really all brilliant. The music is what made Madchester what it is. This is a definitive record, one of Factory's best."
3,Perhaps the best Happy Mondays album,"'Pills 'n' Thrills and Bellyaches' is the most recognized Happy Mondays album, but I still say that 'Bummed' is the better of the two. 'Pills 'n' Thrills' with it's smoother production carried the torch of Madchester, but IMO still doesn't compare to 'Bummed' with it's raw crackling energy, and alot of it has to do with underrated guitarist Mark 'Moose' Day, who trips the light fantastic with his brand of bone-shattering psychadelic funk, an echoing guitar wall of sound. Shaun Ryder is responsible for the lyrics, and is a figurehead as most lead singers are, but musically this is Mark Day's album. 'Bummed' is reckless energy, uninhibited, and yes perhaps E induced...but also owes a debt to the classic riffs of rock, funk, and psychadelia. The sound is like letting wild-dogs run loose from your speakers, and hey, you might actually find yourself dancing around like a wild-dog yourself to this music, afterall, isn't Bez one on E? Let the party begin."
5,What a Crack Up!,"I knew that I had to own this book when I saw the picture of the 2 story outhouse and Dave's title of Chief Executive Peon. Whoever has the guts to put out a book like that deserves to get some royalties!From the very beginning, this book had me cracking up. With talking dogs, and ""vertically challenged"" executives, to stories about his high school principal, and a doomed 10k race. The stories kept me laughing, and kept the material really fresh.I usually don't like business books, but this one is really entertaining. And, I was suprised to see, had some good advice for managers.From one peon to another, Dave, great book!"
4,Suprisingly Good,"I ordered this book after hearing about it from a co-worker. I thought that the cover art looked funny, and decided I could take a chance on $11.The book was a quick read (about 3 1/2 hours), and for a management book, kept me really engaged. Haynes' style is so laid back, you almost feel like you are sitting in the same room, having a discussion with him.His stories, while unconventional, had me laughing outloud in places, and smiling throughout.And while I thought it a little egotistical for a self proclaimed ""peon"" to think he had the answers to all management questions, I got to the end of the book, and realized that he really does have a good grasp on what employees expect from their managers.Well worth the $11."
4,A nice pattern collection,"This is a 69 page pamphlet packed with patterns; most of them are in color. The book gives different suggestions on how to combine them and use them. Some patterns are just alphabet letters.There does not seem to be a scheme to the patterns. They include:Santa, angel, three wise men, candy cane, snow man, fish, owl, butterfly, frog, happy face, mouse, dragon, monkeys, giraffe, eagle, whale, king, queen, jack, air plane, boat, Colonel Sanders, turtle, chess pieces, chess board, deer, turkey, apple, pine apple, cherry, and abstract designs, to name a few.This is a good collection to encourage you to do your own designs."
3,Misleading picture,"It's attractive and functional but be aware that the picture is misleading. The picture shows an eight bottle unit, but the actual item is a four bottle unit - half of what is shown."
1,Half price @ Target,"This includes 1pc.You can get the same item @ Target for $19.99 for 2pcs.Very misleading picture and now that Amazon collects tax on it , terrible deal."
2,Bent,"I bought this wine rack to go with two of the same stacking black wine racks. When I placed it on top of the others, it was bent and didn't lay straight."
5,Good fan,"This fan isn't the quietest, but I've heard worse. It does fit in our smaller window and doesn't fall off the ledge."
5,Handy Fan,"Fan arrived on time, in good condition, is convient to use. runs quietly (two speeds) and does not occupy too much room."
3,Good size and cools well but noisy.,This fan is a great size for a small window or table top. Light weight and nice design. My only quibble is that it's pretty noisy. Sounds like a little airplane. I'm wondering if it's just mine.
5,Nice quality fan...,We are very pleased with this little fan. Perfect size for what we needed and it moves the air just right... Highly recommended item.
4,Good stuff,I have been using GHS for a long time. Found a deal on this and thought I'd give it a try. Works about the same but does seem a little less greasy.
4,It Just Works,I'm a 62 year old player that in years past made my living playing guitar-I live in Texas & still gig on a regular bssis & a lot of the shows we do are outdoors in the Austin Tx area WHERE IT CAN GET HOT & humid as Hell on a bad day so I have been using Fingerease for years--the deal is this s*** just keeps my strings from becoming gunky & funky during sets in these conditions. I also have very acidic sweat that eats up strings & this stuff seems to help add a little life especially on acoustic strings.Spray it on & lightly wipe down with a good lint free cloth & rock on!! Don't go overboard with it & a can will last a while. Be aware that there's something in the smell that attracts insane women looking for someone to take them to church!!
3,"used to think it was great, now not so sure","If liberally applied it seems to work well in cutting down on the string friction. After about 10-15 minutes of playing I always noticed that it would no longer be slick, and would actually become somewhat sticky. Also, I recently replaced my Strat pickguard with a new one of the exact same type, and noticed that the old pickguard had been stained a dull yellow (like smoker's teeth) from using it occasionally on the picking surface. Made me wonder what it was doing to the finish of my Strat and LPC custom."
1,Just doesn't work.,I tried this several times on all of my guitars and it just made no difference at all in the noise. Try something else.
3,Deadline for Love by Leigh Michaels,"From back cover:Lesley Allen didn't want Jay, her fiance, to sell the magazine she was editor of. Still less did she want him to sell it to Cade Randall. Because Cade had hurt her once-and she had no intention of letting him do so again. But Jay needed the money and Cade was the only buyer. Only he wouldn't buy unless she agreed to sign a contract with him-a contract that had more to do with being at home with him than working in his office..."
2,Shock and Awe,"It would be impossible to believe that there is a true ""deadline for love;"" it would be like saying there is a deadline for religion. But with the focus today on youthful love, people might believe there would be a deadline."
1,"a good idea, but mediocre follow-though","-not recommended-This lavishly illustrated book covers a number of parties based on children's books, but really doesn't pay attention to age-related interests. (how many 12-year-olds would be interested in a Bunnicula party and dressing like a bunny?) Alright for younger children..."
2,a mish-mash of mediocre stories; Boyd has done MUCH better,"'The Destiny of Nathalie X' was a total disappointment for me. I have read perhaps a half dozen novels by William Boyd and found them to be either very good or great. He is a brilliant storyteller. But this collection of short stories seem to have been written by someone else, or perhaps by a William Boyd before he reached manhood. Regardless, they are all trite and confused. I suspect the problem has to do with the format. Specifically, short stories don't provide this talented write enough runway to allow is talents to be fully expressed. Instead we are left with dribble.Bottom line: not recommended for anyone, especially William Boyd fans."
2,His Novels Are Much Better...,"I read this collection of eleven short stories (all previously published in various periodicals) in preparation for an interview I was to do with the author, who is also a screenwriter, for Creative Screenwriting,magazine otherwise, I would not have picked it up. As it was, I found little to hold my attention, and I skipped past many a story after reading half. Not my cuppa tea... Boyd's novels, on the other hand, are extremely good, especially The Blue Afternoon."
3,Hustlers Of Culture - Many Styles,"The first half of MANY STYLES by the Hustlers of Culture features some early party breaks a la Fatboy Slim. The first few tracks slide by without making much of an impression, but ""Original Hustler"" throws in a some funky woodwinds. ""Grit"" gets even better, with some more instruments thrown in there for good measure, while ""Deep Joy"" goes for a more easygoing mood. ""Easy"" continues this mood, with a nice get-down groove. The deep, jazzy house of ""Break Da Beats (Remix)"" injects a bit of life into the album, but it's not ultimately enough to make this album stand out among the crowd."
4,"But, is this the full British version?","I notice that all the reviews are US - as am I - but several places with articles about the show indicate that the American version (USA/BBCAmerica) has ""changes"" but none have indicated what those are. I have a LARGE problem with that, so never buy BBC/Granada etc. products until they are verified to be the actual Brit versions - since the changes are never adding more stuff, but rather always removing ""offensive"" stuff. If anyone can clarify the situation on this quite excellent series, I would be most appreciative."
1,crap,"all these songs feature da unda dogg, a bay area rapper/producer that can come very hard-check out his --""best of da millenium""--compilation- but miss this ""hand over fist"" junk- mac dre is only on part of one song, and no beats or verses are worth paying even a few dollars for, let alone (price)"
4,spell binding,"OH please!!!! How many innocent people are put into prison?? Obviously Mick Fletcher WAS guilty because he was sentenced to prison for murdering his wife. I have read the book and newspaper articles and Fletcher, in my humble opinion, was an arrogant man. He showed people what they wanted to see. Of course his friends 'loved' him but that is what he showed them. What a guy .... one who kept leaving his young wife to sleep around ... and then tells his mistress that he is NOT having ""relations"" with her. (And I have a bridge to sell Judge Chrzanowski!!) Michael Fletcher got exactly what he deserved ..... punished for his crime!! The judicial system really does work!!!"
2,A Deadly Account,"It was hard to maintain interest in this fragmented account. In the first pages, it recounts the crime several ways without shedding much further light on it.It looks like the second crime here was how poorly the police handled the evidence. The third crime was attempting to make a book out of the whole mess.I hate to admit that I couldn't finish it. After reading many true crime books, I have high expectations from Ann Rule's masterly handling of character development, description of the scene and coverage of the trial. Henderson's writing fell far short of her standard."
5,Great book!,This book was wonderfully written and shows the reader that things aren't always what they seem. I think the author gives a true account of the actual events and he certianly held my interest from the very beginning to the end. The story itself is so surreal and the author captures that in his writing. Makes you wonder about our judicial system and how many innocent people are put in prison.
1,Author paid off by defense attorneys or what?,"Sorry, but not only was the book boring and repetitive, but Thomas Henderson bent over backwards to present Mick Fletcher as innocent.Michael Fletcher is a spoiled brat, serial adulterer and user of women who had no loyalty to his wife or his child...or even his mistresses. The world apparently revolves around him.And Leann Fletcher's friend was right in his comments that she had it all over the judge that her ""husband"" was cheating on her with. If it's one thing I can't stomach, it's a homewrecker, male or female. She should've been booted off the bench immediately!Justice was done here."
1,Very Disappointed,"I, too, was very disappointed after buying this book. It was a totally one-sided effort to prove the defendant innocent. No matter what the evidence, the author seemed blinded by his own prejudice and favoritism toward Michael Fletcher and his family, including a rather bizarre fascination with Michael's sister, a Christian singer. He seemed to find it impossible to believe that such an attractive woman of God could have a brother capable of committing murder. Perhaps a better title for this book would have been, ""This Man is Innocent, His Sister Said So."""
1,One sided. Don't believe everything you read.,If you knew this couple and the family and the whole story then you would know how painfully obvious it is that he committed this murder. There's much that happened that was not mentioned in this book. Sad how the author disrespected the victim and her family by publishing this garbage.
5,A Deadly Affair,"I worked the streets of Detroit and Greater Detroit during much of my 40 year career as a Michigan PI....I worked many assignments in Hazel Park and the Oakland/Macomb Count area, and I am very familiar with the locations and entities and processes Henderson describes in ""A Deadly Affair""....his detailed descriptions make his narrative very pleasingly real to me....he takes me there, as it were....I thoroughly enjoy his Michigan case books....and I hope he keeps them coming...."
1,Extremely Dissatisfied,"I washed this item in cold water per the manufacturer's instructions and now have a red shirt with pink blotchy sleeves. The color bled so bad the sleeves actually look almost tie-dyed. Not wearable, looks awful...wish I had saved the packaging as I would have sent it back."
2,One of the few sources for kids but it's not really for kids...,"Parents that shop for this type of watch for their children usually do so because of a medical need. Amazon's price was great but, in general, these are expensive watches that you have to buy.So, we get it, my 5yr old son is very excited to wear a watch, no matter the reason and it is HUGE! The face is large because of the vibrating motor, not a problem. What is an unacceptable problem is the band is no where the length needed for a 5yr old, which, even according to the company selling it, is a very common age for wearers of this watch.I called the company, PottyMD, and they say too bad, spend more money on a new band!Even my son's doctor says this is a common complaint.I wish a maker and seller of ""sick"" children's watches would think about the children.thanksfrustrated parent"
4,Fun and different,"The story of two gay baseball players is fun to read. The reader roots for Randy and DJ to stay together, despite the turmoil they experience. The author has a sense of humor and does not take the game too seriously. Tastefully done, and not graphic."
3,A fun summer read.,"An OK gay love story. Sometimes a little difficult to believe, but overall an interesting story. However, it has nothing to do with the real Dreyfus Affair. It's about a star baseball player, who's married with children but falls hard for another player on his team."
3,Like cotton candy...,"I picked up this book because of the recent brouhaha surrounding Out magazine editor-in-chief Brendon Lemon's column declaring he was having an affair with a closeted major league baseball player. Anyhow, Lefcourt writes a romantic comedy about an all-star shortstop and his team's second baseman. It's got its funny, laugh-out-loud moments, but ultimately it's just cotton candy: it's sweet, puts a smile on your face, and dissolves quickly. It would work better as a screenplay."
3,The Dreyfus Affair,"I enjoyed reading Peter Lefcourt's ""The Dreyfus Affair.""However, not once in the book did the two characters, Randy and D.J., say ""I love you"" to each other. To me, that is a major flaw in the book."
4,Splendid but....,"I know nothing about baseball but I still manage to enjoy this hilarious, witty and well written satire. My only complaint is that it lacks in-depth examination of the love between Randy and DJ. After all the cover does spell out that this is a love story.Or does the writer imply something else. Some of the side characters are well developed, in particular the Egyptian psycharist.Overall the story is great fun!"
4,Good stuff...,"The ending is a little 'pat'...but up until the last 20 pages it is a Great read.... but still, good stuff....if you like this one- please try ""The Catch Trap"" by Marion Zimmer Bradley (better written, same sorta story line....)"
5,My New Favorite Book,"I can't remember when I've so thoroughly enjoyed a book. This was one of those rare books that I couldn't put down. I wanted so much to know what was going to happen next. Then, once I'd finished, I regretted reading it so quickly. I should have drawn out the experience, because it was so delightful. I laughed out loud countless times. I just loved every bit of this book and I can't wait to see it on the big screen next year!"
4,If you're a baseball fan,"You will enjoy the characters and the story here. There were good team and baseball management twists and turns, and the personal stories were interesting. It got a bit silly at the end to tie things together, but it's great to read a good story about MLB players coming out and living in the game. A good read!"
2,worth spending a bit more to get a better version,"I have loved Melissa and Doug's wooden toys in the past and thought the quality for the price to be incredible. However, this one was a definite exception. The castanets are ok, but the mallets on the xylophone are square-ended and the sounds of the keys are quite thunky. Not very melodic at all. I got a plan toys xylophone at Target years back that was the same price but much, much better sound."

3,Durability problems,"This is my second one of these lights. The first one worked well for a couple of years but then started staying on all night. I just now replaced it with another one. I would have gone for another brand of light except there really are no options if you want a clean design like this instead of a phony-looking carriage light. I took apart the old light just for fun and found that all the metal parts inside were corroded, including parts of the circuit boards. Obviously this thing will not withstand our wet weather here in the Northwest. I also live near salt water so that may have been a factor. Definitely not weatherproof!"
