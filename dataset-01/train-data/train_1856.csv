1,EDIT: 4 STAR not 1,"EDIT:AS of 4-20-09 after having reread this book I'm bumping it up to 4 stars.Amazon btw will not let you for some unknown reason change your star ratings.All I can figure, back in 2000, I must of been having a bad day, it must of been that time of month..... something, I don't know but this is a great book.One of the better myst of read in fact. The writing is solid and the story has depth.I just wonder now how many books I've done this too. Sorry Mr. Holden."
2,NOT TOO GREAT!,The book was just OK! I mean the author kept going back and forth from present to past and it got very confusing. Also there was a lot of unnecessary nonsense in it too! Hope Mr. Craig gets better.
2,"Wow, I must have missed something.","For the life of me I can't understand how so many people liked this book. Far from being ""on the edge of your seat"" come the end, I thought the ending was pretty much a ""who cares"" as it involves characters that had little role throughout the previous 350 pages. Perhaps if you like lame mysteries, you'll like this too."
2,Four Corners Of Boredom,"If you want a taut, suspensful thriller with interesting characters, zippy dialogue, and a twist ending, do not read this book. Its a plodding story about a missing girl in, of all places, Toledo, Ohio. One of the reviewers above put it best when he said he had to force himself to finish the book. Stay away!"
4,A thriller for people who appreciate moral complexity.,"This is my second Holden novel, and I liked both. His flaw, if you care about such things, is that he sometimes makes characters serve the purposes of his plot by acting in ways that are hard to believe. But if you can accept that, if you can grant Holden that much license, he rewards you by delivering novels that are rich with complex and believable characters caught in fascinating circumstances. Holden writes for adults who understand the multilayered quality of good and evil in human nature."
5,A great read!,"This is one of those rare books that truly shocks the reader. The twist the story takes is wrenching. The writing is lyrical, poetic and heartbreaking. The final pages ache with the unanswerable questions we all ask ourselves..do we really know what's in the heart of a friend? Is there redemption in death? Don't miss this one!"
2,Not so tense thriller,"This book starts off promising much, delivering a story that has elements of intrigue and suspense. However the writing style (first person) and the insistence of the author to try and add twists wherever possible leaves you reading something that has worn thin by the time the twist arrives. Its almost as if you'd rather read about the secondary character Banks, rather than the main character. The two share a past, and now the same fate, both have had their daughters go missing. Its a good book, but there are better thrillers out there that can keep you page-turning. I recommend reading the other books by Craig Holden, as these are more tense."
4,Excellent Christian Metal Core,These guys are great. Straight up Metal Core with a message from our Father. They put on a sweet live show too.
3,A Good Product - But not as robust as the WIndows Version,I recently switched from Windows to Mac and after reading the negative reviews here about this product I purchased it with trepidation. Quicken 2003 for the Mac has worked well for me. I have not encountered any bugs but the program is basic compared with the Windows version. I miss the page that summarizes all financial information. Yet the Mac version does the job and I am happy to have it for my Mac. I find it runs very smoothly.
1,Nightmare Program,"This is the worst program I have ever had the displeasure to use. Intuit has sucked in longtime customers who must continue to use its terrible products because of months of entering transaction data. Even after 4 released updates,the program crashes constantly, can't do any of the basic reporting and graphing the PC version does without wildly inaccurate results or crashing. An absolutely terrible product. Avoid at all costs. I may even succomb to going over the Microsoft Money darkside after my experience with this product."
1,Bugs galore,"You just cannot trust your finances to this program. Bugs pop up everywhere, for example transactions get randomly deleted. Intuit has no competition for the Mac and thus they put absolutely no effort into developing a decent program. Sure there are other basic money management programs out there but nothing with the features of Quicken (at least the ones that work) that anyone with loans, investments etc... need. I was a beta tester for them in the past but would not waste my time doing it again."
1,Don't do it.,"Nothing has been as frustrating as Quicken for Mac. Since switching to the MAC from a PC I have copied all of my mail, documents, and a multitude of other critical pieces with no trouble. But Quicken is a different story. Obscure error messages importing OFX format files from Citibank. Freezing, requiring a Force Quit. No response at all to imports of QIF files. Some worked and some did not. There was no clear pattern. One of the error messages I did get was not documented on Intuit's support pages despite being reported by many people on Google and other places over a year ago. And of course those people never received a response from Intuit on the Google Groups. I know you might be desperate but believe me the answer is not in Quicken for the Mac. I never thought I would cheering the day that Microsoft would write an application for the Mac OS, but come on Bill give us Money."
1,A downgrade from 2002,"The new 2003 interface may be ""better"" but it definitely has more bugs than the 2002 version. Many more crashes, entries disappear after acceptance, scroll bars jump all over the place when switching between accounts. I'm going back to 2002 until a service pack is released."
4,Better than PC's version,"I just switched to Mac and of course had to buy Quicken for Mac. I had been using PC version Quicken 2000. This is much better. It intergrates a way to pay one's bills, where the other didn't have a way to do that. I previously had to set up an account of ""accounts payable"" where now in this version, I used the Calender and enter in my bills that way. Works well with OS X."
3,Switcher gone Quicken,"I was dependent on MS Money on the PC then switched to Mac (have no idea why I waited so long) then had to buy Quicken. Great program but there isn't a MS Money conversion program built in. I had to recreate 6 years of data with importing and file manipulation! Either Mr. Gates needs to capitalize on the Mac market for Money or Intuit needs to get on the ball with ""Switchers""! Overall, a solid performer on OS X. Takes a while to get used to from an entry point of view but it is the best so far."
1,Is there an alternative?,"I've been using Quicken for Mac since it's first version many years ago thinking that with each upgrade the bugs would be fixed, I can't do it any longer, I've lost too many recorded transactions especially in split transactions. I've complained to Intuit about this for years, but can't get past the untrained phone support. Does anyone know of an alternative? I'd be willing to pay 4 times more just for the satisfaction of knowing my banking data is safely recorded. What good is a banking program that loses transactions, what do I tell the IRS?"
3,"True, true........","I have switched from Quicken for Mac to PC AND back and I would say the switch back to Mac was much much easier that to the PC. I only had to fuss with symbols. It wasn't hard, just time consuming.I have noticed a considerable slowdown of transfers with 2003 for Mac over 2001. It takes several seconds to process the download information after downloading is complete. It takes no time to get the information from the bank, but too long to process it. It also takes a long time to quit. I'm hoping this improves with OS X.2. Overall it is a good product."
3,"Not as good or intuitive as the Windows version,but it works","I have not had the stability issues that other users have talked about - it has run pretty solid for me thus far.My beef is that the Windows version of Quicken is easier to use and frankly has a lot more features. I still have yet to figure out some basic stuff on Quicken for Mac that I used to do with no problem back on my Pentium III.(Mac users need to be forewarned that Bank of America does not support some of the built-in banking features (like billpay) that the Windows version does support.)Well, anyway I give it 3 stars for running ok for me, but Intuit needs to take note that there is still a lot of room for improvement here."
2,Why monopolies are bad,"I switched from Windows (XP) to Mac OS X. Everything is better on the Mac, save Quicken. I used Quicken 2001 on my PC, so I expected Quicken 2003 for Macs to be an improvement. Wrong.Quicken 2003 doesn't allow for as much customization of views as the PC version of two years earlier. Also, there's no home inventory, which Quicken 2001 for my PC had. Most importantly, I am can't upload my portfolio and balances to Quicken's website, which is one of the features I used to use the most. I had been in contact with a tech at Intuit's support group, but he eventually stopped responding to my e-mails. It doesn't crash on me regularly, but it does occur more often than with any of my other programs.Two years down the road and the software is worse. Unfortunately, everything I've read about 2004 actually makes it sound worse! Too bad there are no other options - a little compeition might force Intuit to actually improve its product."
3,Switch with care,"I'm a switcher, moving from PC to Mac. I love Mac OS X, it's what made me switch. I'm disappointed in Quicken 2003 for the Mac. There's no direct import of PC data, you have to export things as .QIF files following a strict recipe. When I did that, I got whopping big numbers in my portfolios. I never knew I was a billionaire. It turns out there's some glitch that can be found by graphing the value of a stock and finding where the price skyrockets, then entering a real price for that day. There is also no Quicken 2003 for the Mac support page at Intuit yet. Lastly, there's a problem with the date entry fields where you only can see the year/month but no date. I have not tracked that down yet. Call it beta software, switch with care. Maybe wait for the next version."
2,"HEY, BEWARE OF IRREVERSIBLE ABRACADABRA!","Intuit claimed that her ""Quicken 2003 for Mac"" can serve as my financial organizer. I believed and acquired it. But what happened was the unexpected. The software worked fine for a couple of months and then went haywire! It is disorganizing my data now. My figures joggle up and down, day and night. I have made all sorts of adjustments without any relief. All other software (and hardware) on my system have no problems. I haven't seen anything like this!Had it been that I didn't keep my data protecting passwords secret, I would have suspected people of messing around with my stuff. I'm just tired of correcting all my old data each time I add a new one. Intuit has not been of great help. It's time to fire this 'Chicken', sorry, I mean ""Quicken"".The two stars I scored it is just because it served me well for the first seven weeks: before it went nuclear!"
1,BEWARE 2003 upgrade for Mac OS X! Rating: MINUS 5 stars!,"I've been using 2000 for Mac since it came out and was very happy with it. Since upgrading to 2003, I've had nothing but trouble. Downloading transactions is a nightmare with constant freezes. There are phantom transactions that don't match anything and then disappear. Select one transaction and you can't unselect it. Select one transaction and you frequently have only the option of accepting all not just the one highlighted. Matches that read exactly the same in the downloads and register are not marked as matches so if you accept, you have a double entry. Opening and closing the window doesn't help. Restart the program and your downloaded transactions look the same but the balance in your register is suddenly doubled! I want to go back to 2000, but now that won't version connect to my bank. DO NOT GET 2003 FOR MAC!"
1,Not for everybody!,I recently bought the concept 4 steering wheel only to find out that it wasn't compatible with every DREAMCAST racing game.Too bad because I was very impressed by the steering wheel high quality of fabrication.
3,Not as bad as others may say. . .,"I think that the wheel is very sturdy, the force feedback is strong, the steering feel is good and the various adjustable positions make it adaptable to most users. I really enjoy having it for my racing games - it adds a lot to Speed Devils and Hydro Thunder.The configuration is frustrating because the ""shift"" levers, which you might expect to assign to the gearshifts, cannot be configured, so they will always represent the left & right triggers. The same is true for the pedals. Thus, there is little point in having both and you can never really play a game with the pedals and the silver shift bars. Instead, you'll need to assign the +/- buttons for shifting. This is disappointing because the device is so well constructed - just not setup well!"
3,Don't dismiss it so easily!,"This wheel is not as bad as others may tell you it is. It is compatible with ALL Dreamcast Racers. That said however, you may have to adjust the way you have it set up. Monaco for instance requires that you have a Dreampad plugged into port one and the Wheel in port two. All of this is in the game instruction book. Now for the review. If you NEED Pedals, then get this wheel. If not, go with another. That is really the only thing going for this one. The steering control is too smooth (there is NO RESISTANCE, NONE, ZERO, ZIP). But the set-up is sweet. All buttons are easily ""thumbable"" while racing. The wheel is tilt/height adjustable. The pedals are realistically spring loaded. Nice construction and very comfortable to use. But there are other products out there, that may be better suited for you."
1,60 BUCKS DOWN THE DRAIN,"This wheel/pedals set up is garbage. Don't waste your money on this one. For sixty bucks you can get any game for any system or you could waste it on something you will wind up never using, like this wheel. It handles horribly and is a nightmare to configure. DON""T BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
4,Nice wheel,"This is the first time I bought a wheel and I think that this wheel is about what I expected. I wanted to have some Restance but I don't mind a smooth ride that much. I think most people would like this wheel. The rumbling is VERY GOOD. If you like rumbling this is the wheel for you. It is very comfortable and the rubber grip make it nice to hold. The pedals are also a plus because they are comfortable and make it even a better game. I only used it for Crazy Taxi, if that's any help. It made it easier to do the little move type things. So overall this wheel is pretty good."
1,NOT SAFE for any baby!,"I'd give this item 0 stars if I could ~ Why??? Because this item like any other puffy item (including thick coats and buntings) behind baby in a car seat would ""compress"" in a wreck and the harness would then be loose on baby causing possible ejection from the seat/car. Please don't use this ~ car seat covers that just go over the seat are fine.Shannon ~A concerned parent and car seat geek!"
4,No more bulky clothing,"I am a new mom again after 21 yrs, it amazed me all the new things that are out here. I ordered the nano bag after seeing simular products out there. I LOVE IT . I can say that its a little difficult to latch a 3 point harness into the slot between the babys legs of the new born car seats. I love the fact all I have to do is dress my baby normally for indoors and put her in her seat, no bulky snow suits, or clothing that cant be removed during a car ride, all i have to do is unzip if shes to warm. I returned all the winter clothing I had received or purchased after using the bag........I love it !!!"
5,Great Product,"One of my favorite baby products. We NEVER put a coat on our daughter. It is great for babies born during the fall/winter months because if fit snuggly into the car seat. I liked this product vs. others like it because I like the zipper in the middle. I bought a bundle me light for the spring/summer, but the zippers were on the side. I found that a little annoying."
5,Elijah Great Lives,"This book is a wonderful walk through the life and times of Elijah. Chales Swindoll has many insightful thoughts that stimulate deep discussion. If your looking for light reading then this is not it, but if it is spiritual challange and insight your looking for then your in for a good time."
3,Interesting biography and commentary,"A good audiobook on the life of Elijah. Swindoll follows Elijah through his life and makes comments on how the stages of his life relate to challenges for us today. He takes brief mentions and expands on how they made Elijah the man God wanted. It was especially interesting how much Elijah traveled. Not riveting, but an interesting read about the life of a great prophet of God."
1,Misrepresented,"When I ordered this book, I assumed it would have been written by a Jewish author and Published by a Jewish company. I am sadly mistaken. It comes from a Christian publishing company and the author is Christian. I havn't read the book yet and will be leary of details.I would like to see better representation of books about Biblical characters."
5,hmmm...,"While all of the FEARLESS series are good, (well, most of them, anyway...) they are running on a little bit long. Look at the Sweet Valley Series! There must be thousands of books! There are relatively simple (hah!) issues in this series, which could have been resolved by now. Little and big plot twists come into play here, and, good or bad, they manage to prolong the series--and its success--long enough for the publisher(s) and Francine Pascal to make a few extra bucks. A good series, but if you don't want ot spend the money or the time reading what we know must inevidebly be tons of books, don't start them.-Jessica"
4,Fearless #10: Liar -- great addition to the FEARLESS series.,"Heather and Ed are beginning to become closer -- and Loki , Gaia's dangerously wicked uncle, is getting even closer to her niece. He is beginning to get disappointed in his worker, Ella. And Tom Moore is still worried about his fearless daugher. He, too, is beginning to become closer to Gaia...LIAR is a great addition to the Fearless series that Francine Pascal has been weaving in each book. This is one tightly woven series that never fails to surprise readers, and each book is unique in its own way. Franice Pascal does it again ; although not the best in the series , it is not one to be missed -- it is vital to the series and is certainly very enjoyable."
5,One of the best,"This series is so good, and I can't get enough! I have read Francine Pascal books since I was in high school and this series is her best! I recommend it to everyone I talk to!"
5,Book 10 was awesome!,"The above title says it all, this was probably the best book ofall the ones that are out right now! But, just a suggestion: Read the 9 books before this one to get a better idea of what's going on and stuff like that, otherwise you'll get very confused ..."
4,Francine Paschal has done it again!,"I was eagerly anticipating Fearless 10 (Liar), and I must say I was not disappointed. I was kept on my toes throughout the whole book, and I didn't put the book down until the last page. I liked this book because I was really surprised at Gaia's attitude. The only setback was the Ed and Heather controversy. I must say that this book was different than all other Fearless books that have been published so far! I can't wait until 11 (Trust) is published! Good Work!"
5,Great!,"At first, when I started to read the Fearless books, it was VERY confusing to me, and I thought that I had made a big mistake... boy, was I wrong! I've read the 10 books that are already out and I am anticipating what will happen in the books to come. This serious is the only one at home that I have read that continues throughout the books like one big story. I encourage all of you out there to start with Fearless #1 and read all 10 of them right away! I give all of these books 2 thumbs up!"
3,Very Basic Ibrik,"It will do the job, but is really plain.In the pictures it appears very stylish and expensive, but it's a really basic item/cheaper materials when you look close-up.In my opinion, slightly overpriced for the quality.The coffee I made in it was ok, but don't expect anything extraordinary..."
3,Not big enough and had some dents.,"This item is deceptive because it is not ""extra large"" and doesn't appear to be new...it has dings and dents and was slightly tarnished on arrival. I will not shop at this vendor again."
1,scented powder,with all the great reviews I was excited to receive this powder in the mail but I wouldn't recommend this for anyone! There is a funky old perfume smell when applied I recommend sticking to mineral powders. I personally love my mac face powder its light and scent free!
5,Perfect,"For many years I've used Coty Airspun and absolutely love this product! It's smooth and airy, looks great alone or under foundation. I have no complaints about this product whatsoever!"
5,An excellent and informative introduction to the subject,"This is an excellent and informative introduction to the subject, and is recommended for anyone interested in the history of minor British railways. This edition is 52 pages with 24 pages of photographs included in nth page numbering, and with maps and plans in the text. It is No. 69 in the Oakwood Press' Locomotion Papers, from 1973.Highbridge Locomotive, Carriage & Wagon Depot was the main works for the Somerset & Dorset Junction Railway. ""Few railways have recorded such fascinating details of methods of carriage and wagon building, locomotive water supply and so on as to be found in this book, yet these items were very essential to the running of a line"".The Contents are -P02: ForewordP03: The Locomotive Depots [Bath, Templecombe, Wimborne]P12: Staff DutiesP21: Water SupplyP31: LocomotivesP39: The Whitaker Tablet Exchanging ApparatusP40: Snow PloughsP41: Carriage StockP42: Goods StockP44: Other Activities"
3,Baby nail clippers work fine,"I got these to clip my son's nails, and the little pair works just fine. For some reason the big pair is basically worthless - it leaves fingernails all raggedy when you can get it to clip at all. I don't know if I just got a defective pair?"
4,Silver Puzzle Ring,The ring was very beautiful and exactly as described. The only problem we have is my daughter took it apart out of curriosity. She has not been able to put it back together using the instructions provided on the web. We also noted the silver is very soft and bends easily.
4,puzzle ring,"Love the ring. Very comfortable. Shipping turnaround was great. Only downside is be careful taking it off..takes forever to figure how to put it back together, unless you are looking for something to do. :)"
3,One Wild Oat - Robertson Hare,"A seriously silly little gem with the great Robertson Hare (Oh, calamity! Balderdash!) as a much put upon little fellow whose daughter wants to marry the son of a bookmaker who lives in the same block of flats. Stanley Holloway(who improbably appears in VERY butch drag) co-stars, not Audrey Hepburn who appears in her first film as an hotel receptionist.(NB later both she and Stanley would be together in ""My Fair Lady"". It's the film of a play, and is stagey,(and incidentally not a brilliant print) but a lovely period piece with daft dialogue, silly plot lines and the most chaste kiss in films.Give it a go."
3,Loads of information,"If you are looking for an indepth history of the Anglican church, this is it. It not only explores the past to present, but also issues about the future of Anglicanism. Not light reading."
2,broken also,"this ring has also broken . i wore it three times, and the ruby gems broke off of the stem."
3,Easy Read,"This book is such an easy read that it only takes you a few hours to go through it. It does not have much substance but that's fine every once in a while. Taylor and Ria are enjoyable characters. This is definitely a ""light"" Sandra Brown book."
2,Entertaining but simplistic,"I just finished reading Tidings of Great Joy, and it took me only a few hours. It is amusing and a few parts are even memorable, but it is far from flawless. The beginning is very choppy, and it only gets more interesting after the tragedy happens. There is not much character development, especially considering the minor ones. The emotions of the two main characters are flatly laid out, not with much sublety. It is highly predictable, aside from the very last scene, which, by the way, was very tacky. Nonetheless, after a long day, it can be distracting enough. If you are looking for something fast and uncomplicated, go for it."
3,let down,"This is the first Sandra Brown I've read, and it started off really well. It was an easy read and kept me on my toes to see what Taylor would do. But that ending was a let down. Who buys another person a baby? All she wanted to hear was that he loved her. I was surprised it would end so much like a fairy tale."
2,Not the usual Sandra Brown ending,"I enjoyed the book up until the ending. Come on. The adopted kid that was a surprise to Ria??? Happily ever after, the end??? I hated this ending. It was a huge disappointment. It totally didn't go with the story. I felt left hanging at the end. This is rare for me not to thoroughly enjoy Sandra's writings."
3,Lacking Depth,"I enjoyed this book because it was an easy read. I thought that the 'one night stand' situation was totally believable. Until, they talked marriage. Come on! Who would really do that. I thought they were both extremely insensitive to one another. They had great sex on their minds, and little else. Nonetheless I found the book mildly entertaining. I would recommend it for an easy romance read. The sex scenes were hot. It's just too bad that nasty arguments were the only way to get them into bed."
3,Not Christmasy but Interesting,"Taylor is the perfect man. Ria is a needy, anxious woman. At least it all starts out that way. This is vintage Sandra Brown. I felt compelled to turn the pages until it was finished. However, the ending was disappointing and a bit unbelievable. There was only a bit of Christmas mentioned in the beginning and the end. Most of the story takes place at other times of the year. I don't recommend this book as a Christmasy story but it is an interesting story."
2,A very disappointing Sandra Brown book,"I was hoping for something romantic and sensual to inspire holiday spirit, and instead got something very vulgar and crude. I couldn't bear the hostile way these two protagonists interacted with each other. They couldn't seem to get along except while having sex. It was obvious that this book was written in 1987, because it lacked the polish Sandra Brown has developed over the years, especially with regard to dialogue, which was horrendously written in this story."
2,Sandra Brown disappointed me this time!,"This book was a disappointment especially after reading ""Fat Tuedsay"", which I loved. ""Tidings"" was again your typical girl meets boy, girl hates boy, girl thinks about boy, girl falls in love with boy and they end up happily ever after. Can't any author out there think up a story plot with an ending that totally flips your mind? Something you can talk about with other readers for weeks. ""Tidings"" was only a good fast read around the busy holidays."
1,"Okay, until the end","When I read the summary of this book, I thought it would be pretty good, so I went out and bought it -- even before it went to paperback, which is saying a lot for a cheapskate like me :) Now I wish I hadn't wasted the money. The ending of this book was one of the most moronic things I've ever read in my life. I won't spoil it for anyone who wants to read it, but believe me, it's not worth the time. I liked the idea behind the book, no matter how unlikely it was... but the end had just TOO much corniness for me."
2,Trite and a bit on the gooey side,"Architect Ria Lavender engages in a one night stand with the mayoral candidate Taylor McKensie which results in a pregnancy. To insure that her child is born legitimate, she talks Taylor into marrying her. When the two set up house, they develop feelings for each other. When tragedy strikes, can Ria count on Taylor to help her through their darkest days and not concentrate on his political career?An early effort by Brown, it's schmaltzy, trite, and though it has some unpredictability in the plot, it just isn't well executed. The dialogue is also a little on the vapid side. The best thing about it - the length - you can easily finish it in a couple hours. Thank goodness she switched gears and concentrates on romantic suspense."
1,Tidings of Great Joy,"This book is an insult to paper. It is shallow, and trite with no meaning. The ending is absolutely criminal in its stupidity. Giving a baby, another human being as a gift,....on a trial basis in case they don't like it?... my God how barbourous! Sandra I am ashamed of you!"
3,easy listening kickboxing,"I bought this video off amazon.com based on the 100% positive reviews. Well, it's a decent enough video but not what I expected. The workouts are short and not very strenuous compared to others like tae-bo, Kathy Smith, or Cardio Athletic Kickbox. The cheesy black-and-white flashes are distracting--why try to make an exercise video look like an artsy MTV drama production? And Brannon's voice sounds more conducive to hypnotism or New Age sermons --not saying it's bad, just a little weird in the context of a supposely vigorous workout. It definitely would not be for everyone. A good beginner's video for sure, but advanced exercisers won't find much beyond an ""easy-day"" workout here."
4,Infection spreads. B-,"This was quite a good movie. Good characters, decent acting and nice, engulfing action.It stars Nicole Kidman, a psychiatrist(?) who has to deal with an epidemic spreading around her. She tries to shield her kid and herself from the dangers that are around every corner.Once people start getting infected, the worry for her son Oliver, who spends an enormous amount of time away from his mother (Kidman) only grows.This movie features people catching a virus that ultimately, after you fall asleep, creates extra skin all over your body, especially in the face area and makes you almost unrecognizable. That was probably the nastiest part of this story.I did like, however, how amongst all of the ""zombies"" were people who weren't infected and helped Nicole's character along the way. They were few and far between but it gave you hope.All in all, I think this movie is underrated.B-"
3,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:By far the worst of the Body Snatchers films, and the only one to not offer anything new or interesting, this version should only be seen by people who feel they need to complete the quartet."
1,Superbad.,"Where do I begin with this preachy, dumb film? Should I focus on the terrible acting? How about the lame dialog? What about the pointless pontification at every level? Or about the ridiculous ""tied up in a ribbon"" ending that defies belief? The Invasion is the worst thing I've seen in a ""serious film"" since the dreadful remake of The Wicker Man. In fact, it's worse. I was tempted almost continuously to leave the theater and demand my money back, but it was almost 90 degrees and humid outside. Stay for the air conditioning if you must, but not for this cinematic tripe."
2,Boring..,"I found this movie slow and boring. Though I have five children of my own, I have great difficulty in being entertained by movies in which children play a significant role.It was predictable and not worth my time (money was not important since it was very inexpensive). I wanted to see it after having seen the original directed by Don Siegel (vastly superior) and the remake with Don Sutherland (acceptable)."
3,Slick not Scary...,"It's no wonder this film didn't do well. Put it up there with The Happening, which also featured blank looking people walking like zombies. (Filmmakers take note: blank looking people just aren't scary.) The Happening was slightly more compelling as was War of the Worlds - which this movie may remind you of. Even with Nicole Kidman's (sliding) star appeal, and a dopey looking Daniel Craig - there isn't much to recommend this. Far more suspenseful things await you on prime time TV than this. This alien invasion is about as bad as a flu-borne virus in the air...2.5 stars"
2,"Bad Taste, Bad Movie","A better title for this one might be ""What in the World is Nicole Kidman Doing Here?"" The film begins - in extremely poor taste - using actual news footage (or a very real duplication) of the 2003 Columbia space shuttle tragedy. Incredibly, the footage is used in a fictional context, like showing scenes from 9/11 in a James Bond film. Such was the intellectual maturity of the makers of this film, which belongs (if it belongs anywhere) in a late-night trash marathon on the Sci-Fi channel. This is a paint-by-numbers geek show, with all the standard gross-outs, implausible scenes, bad dialogue and horror movie rip-offs. Even the most ardent Fangoria nerd would be hard-pressed to find anything new here.Two stars for Ms. Kidman's earnest performance. The rest is rubbish."
2,Stars wasted in dullness. Good thing I watched it for free.,"I gave this a couple of stars just for the production design and some action sequences. There is nothing else to recommend, as Kidman does some of her worst work and Daniel Craig tries to match that. The earlier versions of this story were far more effective and certainly were better films too. The little boy playing Kidman's son was appealing; one hopes he will find a better project later. This one is dull and pointless."
2,Disappointing,"I don't know about you, but when I'm up days at a timetrying to stay awake so that alien cooties are unableto infect and take over my body, I get really dark circlesunder my eyes and start acting a little bit punchy. Butthat's just me. I'm not an ""A-list"" actress churning outmovie after movie to support a slavishly extravagantlifestyle. The story held much potential, but the filmdid not deliver. If you have an addiction to all thingsKidman, enjoy horror, and are not quite sick ofseeing her in almost every film that comes along, Irecommend The Others, which provides plenty ofshivers, an interesting plot, and decent acting."
2,Sci Fi Dud,"2 stars because I save 1 star for films that are absolutely horrible and this film is not quite that bad [but almost].I have not seen the original, but the first paragraph in the February 15 review by David Jenkins sums up THIS film very succinctly."
4,Invasion,Best of the remakes. Nichole does her usual excellent performance. It is the same old story though.
1,Video Vomit,"The scariest moment in this filmis when our zero utters the statement""I am a post-modern feminist"".It was at that point that my finger went tothe stop button on the DVD remote.I held out for a while,hoping that there would be a reason for meto continue to watch the film to its conclusion,but finding none, I pulled the trigger.Don't tell me how it ends.I don't care.The plot is a good one.Space aliens, in this case,microbial invaders, possessing human bodieswith their will and intelligence.It has been done on film more than onceand well.The only reason for this film to existis as propaganda for space alien virusesto convince them that it is alright to possesshuman beings because they are just space trashstuck to the planet earth due to gravity.I particularly enjoyed the image ofnormal family life being a resultof possession by alien invaders.Flush this one down the toiletand check out either version of""Invasion Of The Body Snatchers""."
4,"it's a heart thumper,","but it's also thought provoking.it makes you wonder what you might doif a similar scenario were to occur.how would you react?would youresist,or would you quietly accept your fate.i liked themovie,myself.i'm not usually a fan of Nicole Kidman,but i liked her inthis movie.i wish Daniel Craig had had a more significant role.hereally didn't have a lot to do.there are a lot of intense moments inthe film,lots of action.in fact,the film focuses more on action thanthe psychology of the events taking place.had it been the other wayaround,this would have been a very different movie.i still liked it.i'mnot sure why it did so poorly at the box office.it's very relevant intoday's climate.for me,The Invasion is a 4/5"
3,A Fairly Decent Remake!!!,"To me, this is a remake to the Invasion of the Body Snatchers from 1956, and NOT to the 1978 version. Although, I haven't seen the original yet, it's probably a good thing so I wouldn't have to compare them. My dad is a fan of the original, and I don't think he liked this version as well. I love that toward the beginning of the movie, it takes place on HALLOWEEN. Nichole Kidman and Daniel Craig did a pretty good job. I'd probably recommend THE INVASION!!!"
3,Not at all as bad as some describe it!,"It is always brave to make a remake of a classic movie, even more so when there have already been a few. I did see the original 'cult' version which was excellent taking the technology at the time into account and the low budget not the least.But lets be for real. A lot of younger (and older) people never saw that and for some they do need a couple of known actors in it to even consider a movie and for them this version was not bad at all I think. It was not a monumental movie at all but it did what it tried out to do - entertain while raising an important question about the consequences of the human conscience as we know it.Was it great and memorable? maybe not but was it meant to be?"
3,good but predictable movie,"essentially this is an ok movie, well acted but 'cheap' in terms of production. The re-make with donald sutherland is quite superior.but the original still gives me the creeps!!!"
3,the invasion,"Theme has been done several times before and with more suspense and less gore. Movie strayed completely from original work it was based on (which was, wait for it: a book, not nother movie)"
4,Way better than given credit for,"So this was a flop upon release, though it's hard to see why. It's taut, creepy, tightly edited and shot very well. Nicole Kidman does one of her better acting jobs here as the mom who won't give on saving her young son from the body snatchers. If you know the 50s original or the 1978 remake, you will probably enjoy this one, too."
3,Not Great But Not Horrible Either,"This is the latest remake of the 1956 original ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers."" Clearly, it isn't as well written as that movie, or the 1978 remake starring Donald Sutherland. The beginning of the movie features the space shuttle crashing and spreading alien spores from space across a large part of the southern U.S. It shows clips of CNN footage, which may in fact be actual footage from the Columbia disaster(?). Either way, I thought this foundation of the movie was hastily and sloppily done. But after that the movie becomes rather interesting...and fast paced. In some respects, I thought it was scarier and creepier than the original. Nicole Kidman does a fine job in the leading role. However, there is no escaping the fact that this is just another remake. If you have seen the 1956 and 1978 versions, you will no doubt be a little disappointed. But I still found it worth watching."
3,Fuzzy at the edges,"Ok, most bad reviews here are justified. Did we need another remake? For sure not. But on the other hand, a really strong story at the core of the script proves nearly unkillable.And I want to place on record my objection to the Kidman bashing: I think she does a very good job and makes the movie watchable despite all efforts to the contrary, she certainly helps safe the suspense, which is not totally out. (Hope nobody noticed that I am the chairman of the Kidman fanclub in Morning Land.)One objection to the script: the story is 50 years old, the efforts to place it at the turn of the century have given us some nice anachronisms. There is a Czechoslovakian Ambassador in the story, at the same time that the Irak war and the Darfur crisis are issues. Of course one can't expect a Hollywood script writer to keep up with all the political changes in Europe..."
2,Almost as exciting as election coverage,"This is a sort of swashbuckling romp through a story told in film and television on several occasions as noted by most reviewers.Kidman and Craig do an OK job as the central characters and there is a modicum of suspense throughout the movie.It did not take long for the gaps in the plot and the inconsistencies to show through but it was entertaining enough for my fourteen year old to sit through until the end.Good idea, gone wrong. Too superficial, probably just made it into maximum viewer attention span of about 100 minutes and about as interesting as the remake of Stepford Wives. Hang on. Kidman was in that too. These movies must remind her of her ex-hubby.I would rather watch this than the election coverage but it is hard to choose between the two and I would rather not watch the elction coverage although Hilary and Obama remind me of Kidman and Craig.OK if you like this sort of thing."
2,weakest body snatcher loses the point,Invasion of the body snatchers is a classic movie from the 50's. THE 1970's version starring donald sutherland and early 90's version starring meg tilly are also very good but his version is the new hollywood happy ending version. Even the excellent acting of Nicole kidman adn danial craig can't help this because of the ending. The movie is similiar at first to the other versions and the premise remains excellent only this time there's no pods which also lessons the sense of alienation and change. On blu ray this one looks great but the movie itself lost all sense of what the real story was about. The other three versions remain well worth owning though.
2,The Invasion of boring,"What a was of time, the concept was pretty cool, but come on! It's wayyy to predicatable and not only that, if felt like it was cut off at certain scenes. So-so acting, just rent this at best."
1,Don't waste your money,"I rate it 1 star not because the cables don't work well but because they are a waste of money. Yes, s-video is better than the composite cable the system comes with. And component is better than s-video. You should use the best cable that your TV supports. But just get the standard MS A/V packs. I have a very nice home theater with a front projector and 8 foot screen. I'll pay the money to get better quality but I don't waste my money on things that don't matter. I guarantee you that if I didn't tell you which cable you were seeing you couldn't tell the difference. The people who report big differences are either seeing the difference between composite and s-video or are trying to justify to themselves their...purchase."
2,not really worth the money,"Yes these are Monster cables. Yes Monster Cables are better quality than ordinary cables, but the difference between Svideo and Composite is not something to jump for joy about. The differences between Component and Composite is astronomical, and between Svideo is noticeable. If you get these cables, you won't really notice a significant difference in picture quality, (especially if your RCA cables are gold plated and top of the line). I have a Sony 27in Trinitron Television. Connecting my Xbox directly into the Svideo jack didn't do what I thought it would. I was looking for Computer like clarity, and didn't get it. Neither will you. If you ever purchase an HDTV with component inputs, the difference will be there. Until then, don't waste your money. It might be a good idea to get the Gamelink Optical adapter for Dobly 5.1 sound however. Oh, if you have component inputs on your television then buy the XGL400 not the XGL300."
3,Industrial reference material,"This book is often referred to as the best on the market. Yes and no. True, it is the most professionally written book on mold making. However, if you are looking for technical instruction, this is not the book. I realize that definitive information about mold making is not acquired through any one single book. Yet, having read this book years ago in art school, I was not able to translate any of the information into practical use. The processes illustrated are industrial with zero creative applications. It is obvious that Frith is a master mold maker, but it is my opinion that he has forgotten what a beginner needs to know. Overall, the techniques shown (production pottery) are limited but depending on your background, perhaps some of the processes might be eye opening."
1,shop worn reject SOLD AS NEW !,"I would like to have known the book was incomplete, worn and the pages were untrimmed. After purchasing this book as new, I hesitate to order anything thru Amazon."
1,waterproof labels,I was told in a email question to the seller that these labels were waterproof on ink jet printer. They are not. The package specifies they only work on laser jet. The seller would not take a return of the labels and told me I should have done more research on the product and that the buyer should beware. Not a good Amazon merchant. I can not speak as to how the labels would work on a laser printer.
5,Booster packs are great!,"Each Booster pack comes with one common figure, one rare, and one super rare! I got tusken raider, death star gunner, and wedge. I love attacktix. I'm saving up money to buy another booster pack now!"
2,Decent Tent With a Poorly Designed Rain Fly,The tent itself seems to be decent for the money. It went up with no trouble and appeared well made. The problem is that on my first night in the tent it rained. The rain fly simply does not adequately protect the window and door. I had the window and door both open for ventilation (screens in place of course) and rain dripped right in and I ended up with damp bedding.The next evening was dry and the tent was fine. The tent packs small and light and I appreciated the two removable mesh storage bags on the walls along with the mesh shelf in the ceiling - which is where I kept my phone and wallet so they would be sure to stay dry.I'd skip this tent if you camp in wet conditions. There are certainly other comparable tents out there with better rain protection....
2,Broken brow poles,"My Scout son and I researched several tents, and this is the one he chose to buy. I was leery about several of the negative reviews, but it was his money and a good learning experience. Guess what - both front and back brow poles broke overnight, the first time the tent was used.I'm aware of Amazon's liberal return policy, but frankly it's not their issue. I've guided my son in contacting the manufacturer to request warranty replacement. Not too hopeful there. We may look at replacing the fiberglass brow poles with aluminum poles. The rest of the tent is fine.>>Update: We contacted Eureka directly about the broken brow poles. New poles were delivered at no charge. Still may look at aluminum poles. Son loves tent."
1,Tent leaks!,"I have just read some of the other reviews and have to believe someone from the company wrote them....It leaks, it leaks, it leaks...The way it is designed, it can't not leak in heavy rain...Look at my other reviews.. I am normally very positive, but this tent is a fair-weather tent only. After our experience with this tent I had to spend almost $400 on a Sierra Designs tent (doesn't leak, really nice tent too). I was sooooo hopeful that this tent would ""do"", but it really didn't.On a HUGE plus side, Amazon did take it back and refund.Tent leaks in multiple places; including door seam, back panel, and through seams on Rainfly! This is NOT normal condensation (I promise), but leaks that resulted in two bath towels and one sleeping bag getting soaked. The tent was set up according to instructions with Rainfly secure and failed to keep its occupants (2 adults and a three year old) dry during a rain. Made for a miserable experience."
3,in short - it leaks,"The fly is poorly designed. In back, it doesn't come down nearly far enough to cover the floor/body seam. The upper part of the tent isn't waterproof and water on it leaks through above the floor seam.On the front, the fly doesn't extend out or down far enough and water on the door leaks through the zipper."
2,a OK tent...,Hoped for better...is not waterproof. Tried to make it water proof with no luck.(used 2 different sprays.) Needs a bigger rain fly. Very easy to put up and take down. The floor is the same material at walls. Dampness comes up thru floor if a plastic ground cover is not used.
3,Not so impermeable.,"Once I had an Eureka tent before and it was a great product. That's why I decide to purchase this item. However, I am dissapointed to realize that this tent is not propperly impermeable. On my first camping I experienced some rain and some water indeed got inside. I recommend this tent only if you prentend to camp on very mild weathers with very little rain."
1,NOT RECOMMENDED,"This tent is poorly engineered. 1) You need take along a tape measure or somehowmake sure that the floor is staked down perfectly square, otherwise nothing alignsright after that. 2) the ""awning"" pole/tabs/holes design is flawed. Either the poles needto be shorter or the tabs need to be positioned lower (or something). As is the ""fit"" isso tight that sooner or later (probably sooner) the awning poles will fail. 3) after afew uses, the main poles start to ""remember"" their bent shape and will not returnto straight. Later, after more uses and not having the floor set ""square"" you maynotice the main poles curving this way and that depending on the situation. If youwant a tent in this one's price range, look for a different brand. DO NOT BUYTHIS TENT!(Oh, and the velcro loops to hold the fly are a joke, and even the bag for the polesis cheap and so short that you can hardly tie the end closed.)"
2,Mediocre,"As other reviewers have stated, there are several design flaws, including placement of the rainfly, that make this tent a minimally functioning option. In addition, both my Tetragon 7 and 9 developed large gaps between corner seams. The zipper gets caught, poles did break after a year but were replaced. There was some water in a few corners, but the tent did withstand some severe thunderstorms and all night showers. There is great ventilation and the overhead pockets are nice. I may use it for another season, but really need to seal up the gaps and also probably do a tick-proofing."
1,Poles broke the first time we used it,The tent poles are cheap and several of them snapped the first time the tent was used. Amazon was great with the refund and even paid for return shipping.
1,"Design flaw, sealing seams won't help!","The reviewer below suggesting sealing the seams DOESNT own this tent! I agree that sealing seams is a good idea on cheap tents; however, this tent has a design flaw that causes it to leak!Expand the photo on Amazon and look at the Rainfly...The bottom of the door (and back window) extend to where the rainfly stops. The Rainfly actually channels water onto the lower sections of the door and rear window.This creates two problems;1.) You cannot enter the tent while it is raining without getting quite a bit of water in the tent with you (remember the channeling effect?)2.) The constant stream of water on the zipper causes a steady leak inside the tent.If the Rainfly was ""A-framed"" instead of ""Arched"" I don't believe it would be a problem.Drives me nuts that someone who doesn't even own the product would post a 5-star review"
5,great read,This was a really fresh and exciting book. I was hoping to buy it for a friend for Christmas. I hope Amazon gets it in soon.
4,Does the job!,"I am quite satisfied with ""Hair Off Facial Hair Remover"". The application brush that came with it was defective but I just used a Q-tip instead and it worked just fine. It didn't cause any sort of redness or rash on my face. It did sting a bit as the 4 minutes ticked by, but as soon as I washed it off, my face felt fine. I struggle finding facial hair remover in my local stores and usually end up paying over $10. This product was considerably cheaper and I will definitely purchase it again. The only reason I did not rate it 5 stars was because of the defective brush."
2,OK,I will go back to Nair. It just didn't remove the hair on my upper lip like Nair does. Disappointed.
3,Future,"The book offers some insight into the future of education. However, the authors are victims of their paradigm since the book was obsolete as soon as it was printed. It is an easy read and does provide some food for thought.Windows on the Future: Education in the Age of Technology"
2,You wil need time and money,My advices:1) Each box of the game have a password therefore you cannot resell or len it (if used).2) It's online ONLY. You need an broadband internet connection.3) You have to pay a monthly fee ($12 ~ $20).4) A 20 GB hard drive will fall short in the meantime.5) You need an USA credit card with local address.6) Install it overnight (while you sleep) because it takes a long time to download the updates and patches.7) Not for casual gamers. It will take several hours a day. It's like a job. If you have a life of your own you won't enjoy this game.
1,This game sucks!!!!!!,I think this game was misleading and fustrating which made me wish I would have never bought it and I hope to sell it on ebay for little of nothing because thats how much I felt when I tried to play this game.....Nothing
2,may be a fun game but,May be a fun game but found out after opening it's for an xbox 360 not a regulart xbox which we have.
5,The Best Game Ever,"My son LOVES this game. He is an advide gamer since the age of 4 (he is now fourteen). I have watched him play Final Fantasy XI and the graphics are exceptional. This is the only game he has played for the last month and he still can't get enough of it. He keeps saying, ""This is the best game ever!"""
1,Horrible,"Do Not buy. They claim when you first try to load to play this game you can play free. You can not, you have to pay to play. It is all a gimmick on this one. Stay away from this game. It is a con."
1,Incomplete,"I have always been a fan of Final Fantasy games, I also had a WoW account for over a year. However the latest adoption of bringing this title to the Xbox 360 was poorly done. To start it takes three hours to install, including an hour of downloading updates, and it uses 5 gig (yes 5 gig) of your hard drive. Next up, controls they are bulky, and not utilized properly. To really play the game you will need a USB keyboard. The game does not have achievements as the rest of the 360 games do.I will be exchanging it tonight."
1,ripped off,I got the game used and your not suppost to sell it used. Im telling everyone who wants to buy it. Dont get it used. It says in the license agreement the game is not suppost to be sold used only new and unopened
1,Very fast shipping,"I hav'nt opened it yet due to the fact that I dont get my 360 till christmas.. But the shipping was very fast, I used the 2 days shipping and got it early this morning."
2,IT GOOD BUT 13$ A MONTH TO PLAY SUCK,THE GAME IT SELF IS GOOD. ALL THE ONLINE PLAY IS GREAT BUT IN ORDER TO PLAY IT YOU HAVE TO PAY FROM 12 TO 20 DOLLARS A MONTH. SO YOU WILL NEVER GET YOUR MONEYS WORTH.
3,I'm sure it's high quality cause it's Sony but seems pricey,"$700. Uh, why not just spend that on a notebook computer from dell or hp and get a 15"" screen, 40GB harddrive, and all the other added capability of a computer. Then you can play games and burn cd's and dvd's as well for about the same amount of money. The only thing better about the dvd player vs the notebook is it probably has a slightly longer battery life and is better in terms of portability...lighter and smaller form."
5,WOW! That was a REAL exciting trip to the real Siberia,"Siberian Light is a lot of things. It's a murder mystery, a kind of Baedecker of Siberia, and even a technothriller too if you forget about Tom Clancy and think INTERNET. It proves the world is getting so small even Siberia is available at the click of a mouse. I loved it."
3,Great but fell apart at the end,I was really into this book and couldn't put it down - White is a great writer and the detail was fantastic. You really feel transported to Siberia. The suspense was building and building but then I thought it fell apart at the end. We find out what the conspiracy is but it is never really explained who was at the very base of it and what their motive was. Maybe I missed something - please email me if you disagree.
2,As good as Gorky Park -- NOT!,"Started strong, then lost its way. The relationships between the main characters goes from interesting to tedious. I quit about three fourths of the way through."
3,Great for light reading,"I found this book great for light reading or listening. It is a fast pace book with lots of adventure. Not all books require depth, some should just be enjoyed. It was fun to hear."
2,Skip this one.,"I waited eagerly for the next Johansen novel after Ugly Duckling and A Long Dark Night, but was very disappointed in this one. The storyline was silly; don't bother. She is capable of much better than this."
2,disappointing,"If youv'e ever read Iris Johansen before, you should just skip this one. I thought it started off great, but then it just died. We're asked to believe that a hard CIA agent, who would sock a woman in the jaw to get the bad guy, would then become a virtual slave to her every whim.In spite of the fact that the whole second half of the book, she is a target of a mad man,she's calling all the shots and he's obeying! Give me a break!Though this is a poor showing, I am still a fan of Ms. Johansens suspense novels.Want to read a good suspense novel by her, get ""Ugly Duckling""."
4,Entertaining read,"I was in the mood for an fast entertaining read, and this book filled the bill. Actually, I read it years ago, and recently re-read it. It's suspenseful with a nice touch of romance. I am not going to argue with other posters who say the characters were not fleshed out or the plot was unbelievable. I enjoyed the story and the resourcefulness of the characters, and the constant sense of impending danger. I wasn't looking for a literary exploration of the human condition, just a fun read with likable characters and a fast-paced plot, and this is it."
1,Main character is obnoxious!,"I have read hundreds of mystery/thriller books and rarely have given up on a book half-way through - which I did with this one. I could not stand the self-centered, argumentative main character, Bess Grady. Neither she or the plot were believable - even for a work of fiction."
1,An annoying read...,"I read romances because, well, because I find them relaxing and they bring a smile to my face. This book totally failed to do that, and I swear my blood pressure rose to danger levels while I read it. I absolutely detested the 'heroine'. I presume that her actions were supposed to be self-sacrificing and noble, but in truth they were the ultimate height of selfiness (willing to sacrifice whomever it takes if need be to get her way). I thought she was one-dimensional, unkind, disagreeable, unsympathetic, and totally self absorbed...kinda what you'd expect in the antagonist of a novel, not the protagonist. I couldn't get past my dislike of the main character to determine whether I found the rest of the story engrossing or not..."
1,Worst Iris Johansen book I've ever read,"Absolutely LOATHED this book. The only redeeming quality was the fact that -for once- the male lead wasn't a gorgeous sex god. Other than that... The whole thing was unbelievable, the characters predictably idiotic, and boring, and the whole thing just fizzles along to the end, which leaves the reader disappointed."
1,I can't believe I read the whole thing.,"Improbable, implausible, impossible, irredeemable dreck. Kaldak the guy whose job requires the occasional murder is putty in the hands of unlikeable annoying Bess. It took a lot of effort to plow through the pages of this pathetic thriller. Only recommended for people I heartily dislike."
1,Unbelievable (In a bad way),"I had hoped to find a book something along the lines of a Vince Flynn, Brad Thor, or Alex Berenson novel. Boy, was I wrong. In Bess Grady, we have a protagonist that is completely bratty, self absorbed, and unlikable. Compounding my frustration, this young photographer is allowed to call the shots and make demands of a strong CIA agent (and the whole agency) when millions of American lives would be at stake."
1,"Save your money, save your time","This is the first book by this author that I have read, and I bought it because the blurb looked interesting.Now I know why they say: ""Don't believe everything you read.""This book is terrible. The characters have no depth, the plot has holes you could pilot the ""Titanic"" through, and the situations are entirely unbelievable.If I hadn't paid as much as I did for the book, I would throw it away before finishing it. As it is, I'll finish it, then wash my hands."
2,"Kaldak, take me away!","I was not able to finish And Then You Die. I had high, or at least, optimistic hopes for this book. It begins promisingly enough with the Bess character and her sister stumbling upon the scene of an mysterious mass epidemic in a small Mexican village. The level of suspense remained high when Bess was captured by a seemingly malevolent Mexican colonel, and aided in her escape by a brutal killer.The book gets steadily less interesting as Bess bonds with her protector. Part of the problem is that Bess is essentially an idiot with kneejerk impulses. Any sympathy I had for her was undermined by her sequence of stupid decisions and comments. In a rather implausible series of events, she effectively makes herself the head of the CIA, able to order everyone around her.I quit the book during an appallingly bad sex scene between Bess and her protector. I just couldn't take it anymore."
1,The most dislikeable main character I've come across.,"I listened to about 3 of the 5 cassettes and grew to loath the main character. At every sensible suggestion, this woman said no, or disagreed or something. Rarely have I had a more negative reaction to a book."
1,Crazy,"I have a problem with all Iris Johansen books. It's the same with this one. The story may create an interest, but the writing is so bad that at times I cringe. What is awful is that I will look at and buy another one of her books hoping that it will be worth reading."
2,And Then You Die,I did not like this novel at all. The characters were annoying and not very believable. I had to force myself to finish the book. Definetly not one of Iris' better novels! I would skip over this one if I had a choice.
4,a good read,this was the first iris johansen book i had ever read...my grandmother recomended it...i thought it was a very good book...and have started reading more of her books...not all are good but there not bad...you just need an open mind
4,"very good story, definately worth reading","This was the first book by this author and I truly enjoyed it. Very easy to read, yes it was a page turner and I am now reading Long after Midnight."
4,enjoyable book,"Maybe not the best mystery I've ever read, but it's a good book. The story was good, the characters could have been a little more interesting, but the book was worth reading.......not a waste of time."
1,Painful to finish,"Unfortunately, I was brought up to finish the books I started and in this case, it is very painful. In her first draft for the book, Ms Johansen probably had a 13 year old girl in puberty cast as the herione, who always just says ""no"", ""I do not want to eat"", ""I do not want to sleep"", etc. The herione in this book is so stupid but she always knows better, telling the entire CIA what to do next, although she has no idea what is going on, yes, very probable plot indeed. Well, I have about 100 pages to go, wish me luck!"
1,Read And Die of Boredom,"This is without a doubt the most insipid book I've read in a long time. I found the characters unbelievable and the plot unrealistic. Bess, the main character was a real witch. This was ""formula"" writing at its worst. I wouldn't waste my money on it."
2,A disappointment,"Save your hard earned cash. This book was a disappointment from page one. I admit, I did find the story line to be intriguing, but the characters were poorly written. Bess was uninteresting, and time and time again I thought if I were there, I'd wring her neck. The only reason I didn't give this one star is that I did become a little interested in the end and actually finished the bok. I can't tell how many times I put it down with no intention of finishing it. I'm glad I waited for the paperback."
2,A waste of time and money,"""And Then You Die"" is the second book I have read by Iris Johansen. My first was ""The Ugly Duckling"" which I thoroughly enjoyed, so I bought ""And Then You Die"", which is TERRIBLE! Like some of the previous people have said, the CIA would never have done all that for Bess, and if Esteban really wanted Bess dead, he could have easily of done it, by exploding her house, sending a sniper, etc, etc; it's not like he couldnt afford it. Another thing is that Iris Johansen overly uses the phrase ""Damn you"". It seems like throughout the entire novel someone is damning someone else. There really were no twists in this book,it was entirely predictable, and the book just died after Bess got away from Esteban on about page 50."
3,Bess Is A Pain,I got tired of Bess in a hurry. She was so demanding and I guessshe thought she knew better than the pros. She was just a photographerfor heavens sakes.
3,"entertaining, suspensful",this was a very enjoyable book. though did i miss a chapter? it seemed like there should've been a book before this one...but you can enjoy this one without strings attached!
3,Hard to get through,"This book was alright. I bought it because I enjoyed Johansen's other books (Face of Deception & Ugly Duckling), but this one wasn't up to par. It was very drawn out, and at times I just put it down because I couldn't stand reading it anymore. Once I got over the middle portion (which seemed like the longest part) the end went by a lot faster. Wouldn't be on the top of my list of recommendations."
2,"Annoying, Annoying, Annoying!","Although, the plot was very good and well thought out. The characters were extremely annoying! Especially Bess! I found her to be extremely stubborn! It seemed like the author was trying to make her appear to be independent and strong, but she didn't come off like that. I found myself wishing that she would die, and the person to do it would be Kaldak! I also found the love scene between them to be really brief and not well thought out at all! It seemed sloppy and it seemed like the author just threw it in there after the final revision. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone!"
2,"Change your books, PLEASE!!!","I thought this book was good, but I had already read Long After Midnight before I read this book, and they are EXACTLY the same.I wish Johansen would change the story line. I just bought The Ugly Duckling and I'm hoping that book takes a different road. I read one of the reviews on it and the guy said it's the same too.She needs to change it up. Every book has a woman who needs to go into hiding because someone's trying to kill her; they have a man to protect them, they fall in love, have sex, stay together at the end.CHANGE THE STORY A LITTLE!"
2,Mediocre suspense novel,"Bess Grady is on a routine assignment in small-town Mexico as a photojournalist, but the howling of dogs triggers a terrible memory she's worked so hard to supress, and she knows she's stumbled onto something sinister that she must fight. Along the way she encounters the dark and mysterious Kaldak, a man she's not sure is out to kill her or help her bring down the cause of the evil that has brought destruction to the town and threatens the world.Frankly, this was not an incredibly impressive suspense novel. Nothing was awful, but nothing was great, and the slightly-below average rating comes from the total implausibility of the plot. There are much better suspense novelists out there, who write gripping stories with complex characters and good writing. Nevertheless, this one entertained me enough while I was reading, and I've since picked up two more books by this author to try, so go figure."
2,Not a very suspenseful or gripping novel,The plot was pretty believable but the main character Bess Grady was so annoying you just wanted to smack her. Story lacks depth and suspense not really a page turner. Don't know if I would read another of her books even though they were loaned to me by someone who raved about them. I don't share their opinion about them being so good you can't put them down.
1,This book is not worth reading--a big disappointment.,This is an unfortunate book which never should have been published in it's current form. The dialogue is stilted and foolish. A child in fifth grade may write more believable conversations. The plot and character motivation is just plain silly. The author has created stereotyped characters who do what the author tells them to do. Ms. Johansen obviously has an idea in mind for how to get from the beginning to the end but people would never be so stupidly motivated. The plot is totally unbelievable. There is no logic to any of it. This book is completely terrible and I hope the author will not allow anything this bad to be published again.
3,Fast-paced but lacking substance.,"I agree with the past reviewers, this book is good to a point, but when you can read nearly 400 pages within a few hours, there is something lacking (large-sized print, not counted). The plot was good and was a sign-of-the-times terrorist story. However, the strong character, Kaldak, was rather subservient to Bess, the photojournalist to the point of being ridiculous. Every request she made he adherred to without qualm. I did enjoy the secondary plot or storyline regarding the Tenajo setup by Kaldak. The romance was very disappointing as was the epilogue. This story read like an outline for a novel. A lot of potential but very little depth. Maybe if was a ""Rush-to-Publish."""
5,I.J.'s thrilling and enchanting style,"I really enjoy IJ's work and how she keeps me on the edge of my seat. I listened to the unabridged version while doing housework and found myself listening in the car as well. I would recommend it. Bess can be a little pain at times, but I got over that. Kaldak was actually not a gorgeous stud, but that made it all the more believable. Check it out."
5,My Favorite by Johansen,And Then You Die has easily been placed at the top of my favorite book list. Some of the reviews complain that some of the events in the book aren't quite believable. Well I don't think they are meant to be. We all watch James Bond and and love every second even though it goes outside the bounds of plausibility. Bess makes a great heroine and Kaldak is a great combination of nail hard toughness and some well disguised compassion. The plot takes off at lightning speed from the second you open the book and you turn the last page with a definite groan of disappointment. If you are a Mary Higgins Clark fan this is the best treat you could give yourself. Iris Johansen takes the suspense/romance genre to a new level.
5,Impossible to put down.,"An engrossing real-life book about Baltimore homicide detectives. It's an excellent book, and if you watch the show, then it's a great book to read. Even if you don't, you'll enjoy it."
5,Excellent,"An outstanding piece of journalism from Mr Simon. One of the best books ever. Mind you, I've only read about ten."
5,Not just for fans of the show...,"This book is brilliant. As a would-be journalist, I would say ""life-altering"". Not only is the subject matter compelling, the style is sweet enough to make Ann Rule cry like a little girl. And to think I only bought it to play ""Match The Composite"" with the series."
2,Monotonous -- if you've seen the TV show,The first season is a near-perfect translation of the events in the book. I have the first season DVD set and I didn't get anything out of the book that I didn't get out of the show. I found the book to be incredibly boring; I only read 2/3 of it.
2,Where's the Color,"As a long fan of Mister Miracle comics and a fellow artist who loves the work of Jack Kirby, I find this book as an insult to a great legacy. I didn't know how important color would of meant to keeping the feel and creative mastery that only a Kirby superhero was capable of.I don't buy the idea that the publisher of this book found it a problem to reproduce the original color. Even I have some of the original Mister Miracle comics and have created PDF files creating several of them and the color is just fine.If you are a true Mister Miracle fan or comic book collector of any sort please be advised to skip this one and wait for a color version. Black and white takes away the true feel and excitement that I remember while reading a Mister Miracle comic at an early age.Stay away."
3,Decorative Hair Comb,The comb was smaller than I thought it would be but it is definitely functional and stylish as is - excellent purchase.
4,Beautiful stones,Service was great. The stones on this comb are lovely but the comb itself is hard to get in my hair. I can't really use it to hold my hair it is more a decoration when I have some other way to secure my hair.
2,Not heavy stock,I was looking for something that would make a nice note card. but this is pretty thin stock. It is hard to find note cards for laser printers (not just ink stock). it is just slightly heavier than 80 lb paper.
2,Do what was promised,Bought this to connect two D-sub cables. But when received it only one side has hex nuts to grab the screws from cable sides and other side nothing. No what i has shopped for . I dont recommend buying it if you looking to connect two D-Sub cables with 15 pin.
4,Intiguing illustrations make students beg for more.,"As a teacher, Eve Bunting and Jan Brett are my favorites. The illustrations bring the story to life and it is just scary enough for the very young. In this day and time however; when I read the book to my kindergarten children I usually paraphrase ""in praise of Halloween"" and ""on hallowed Halloween"" just because I don't want to upset parents."
5,"wonderfully scary, but not too much","I just discovered this book and took it home to my two year old and he loved it.The writing style is simple and straight forward, and has just the right amount of spookiness- it was neither too scary, nor too mundane. The illustrations are clear and attractive, and fun for a small child. My son enjoyed pointing out the different monsters as we flipped the pages.As soon as I was finished reading it my son asked me to read it again, and for a children's book, I cannot think of higher praise."
5,Frightening Fun,"This delightful little book has all the charm and spookiness of the holiday it represents. As a twenty-two year-old adult, I think this book has equal appeal for adults and children.Jan Brett's luscious, beautiful pictures perfectly depict the gorgeous darkness of Halloween night and the vibrant colors of different costumes (or are they really monsters?) Accompanied with these pictures are the rhymes of Eve Bunting's wonderful poem, with words easy enough for kids to understand but spooky enough to give even adults a chill.Both the poem and the pictures, like Halloween, are fittingly creepy and even haunting while still being fun. Together, they make this book the perfect package for anyone wanting to enjoy the true essence of all Hallow's Eve. I earnestly invite you to enjoy this, my dears (polishes fang, retracts claws)."
4,Gorgeous illustrations add a star to my otherwise midrange review.,"The artwork in this book is really nice and detailed. But as far as Halloween books it isn't ranking up high for my 4yo son's favorites. He thinks some of the illustrations are ""scary"" and call me overprotective, but I wasn't thrilled with the devil page. In a year or two I expect my son will like it a lot more."
1,Frame arrived both damaged and broken,"Picture frames: the ideal solution for displaying things on your wall. Unfortunately, that is not possible when the frame arrives looking like it went six rounds with a yokozuna. Here are some things you can do with a picture frame from MyFrameStore:(1) Fend off attackers with the shards of broken glass(2) Display a picture of your worst enemy(3) Burn it for warmth that lasts five minutes(4) Use the Amazon box that it was shipped in to fashion a frame that is of higher quality than anything sold by MyFrameStoreShame on you Amazon, shame on you MyFrameStore and shame on you Nickelback (they have nothing to do with this transaction but they've made a lot of crap songs)"
4,Very good quality,"This is a very nice quality frame. I did not give 5 stars only because there was no dual easel as described. Other than that, this one is a very good looking frame."
1,Poor Quality,"Ordered this exact frame once before and was pleased, but the second frame was of poor quality. The backing was not cut to fit the frame, exceeding the frame. Not attractive for displaying photographs."
1,Poorly Made!!!,"This frame is junk. It was supposed to be part of a gift, but it can't be used for that. The cardboard on the back was not aligned with the frame, and stuck up past it on the top and one side. The black accent stripes on the front did not line up properly."
5,EXCELLENT SERVICE,"We ordered two frames and received them in two days via UPS.The quality of the frames exceeded our expectations and the speed of delivery, the quality of the material and packaging was outstanding.We will most definitely use ""my framestore.com"" for all of our requirements for frames. My wife is a calligrapher and does a nmber of different poems which require high quality frames - and the selection available is really a great asset."
2,"Really, Such a Shame!","Yes, what a shame that Sandra sings the covers of anothers. Song contains to much dancing elements, therefore there is nothing special. Very unineresting, savourless arrangemets, only interesting things are woman's shouting and quiet applause at begining and end of this song. P.S. Sometimes at this song Sandra's voice sounds with very strong germanish articulation but this is a compliment."
4,John Gower and a New Vision of the World,"JOHN GOWER -Confessio Amantis Gower`s contribution to the developement of English literature is very important . Though he spoke French and Latin ,two languages very popular in the fourteenth century he found it important to write in English . In ""Confessi Amantis ""Gower leaves behind the morality and admitting with honesty that he was not born to set the world right starts telling stories about Love . Anyway , he tries to mingle the parts of a lover poet and that of a Christian moralist ; the lover must learn to be a good and virtous man . The book is a collection of more than a hundres stories of various length and of very diverse origin , from Ovid to the Bible , all told in a captivant and pleasant style ."
5,"Metals Handbook, Desk Edition","Every metallurgist and materials engineer should have one of these on the shelf - unbelievable amount of information. I bought mine to use for the 2003 metallurgy PE exam - it probably helped me on over 70% of the questions. I passed first time - I wouldn't have had a hope without this book. Mine is the 8th printing (1995) - I don't really see a need to buy the very latest edition unless money is no object,"
4,Connectors too tight!,"This is a great component cable for the original Xbox, however the connectors are so tight to put on. I'm not sure I'll even be able to disconnect them if I have to. I like Monster products, but they are a little expensive. These were the only new component cables I could find at the time for the original Xbox."
4,Not bad...,"For a Monster cable, it's everything I expected. Very sturdy construction, you can feel its weight and everything is made of quality. No complaints on this one except one.Price. That much for a component cable?! I guess you get what you pay for, but seriously...that's a bit expensive. That's pretty much why I gave it four stars instead of the five stars it could have easily gotten."
3,"Good cable in theory, but poor execution","While this cable will definitely give you the cleanest signal you're going to get from your XBox, be careful as the construction quality is not all you would expect for the outrageously high price. The RCA plugs fit EXTREMELY tightly and the first time I had to remove the cable from my television (gripping correctly by the plug!) they were so tight that one of them simply fell apart. On seeing the internal construction of the plug I wasn't surprised; it's just barely attached to the cable by a tiny bit of solder. Caveat emptor."
2,Overpriced,"I have a friend that uses these cables with his X-Box and HDTV. Being curious as to if they provide any improvement, I took my MS HD cables over to his house and we compared them with his Monster. We saw very little difference with the two sets."
3,"Great picture, very hard/scary to connect","As others have noted, these connectors are way too tight. I assume this is Monster's way of assuring that your connection doesn't become loose and fall out, but I think it's far more likely that you'll break your TV. I had to apply way more force than I felt comfortable with putting on an $800 TV (and I'm sure most people who buy this cable have much more expensive setups than I do). Really irresponsible on their part, I think. It appears that at least one reviewer here broke their TV putting them on, I consider myself lucky that mine seems to have survived. I actually decided on the last connector to bend the connector with pliars rather than push any harder, and I ended up breaking part of the outer ring of the connector, but it made it fit and it works. Now that it's on the picture is great. Big improvement from composite."
3,Quality product but must have miscalculated some specs,"The cable is outstanding. It is very thick and the quality of the picture that is produced knocks composite cables out the water. But like many of the other reviews stated, the actual component cables are very hard to insert or take out of your TV. So much so that instead of risking damage to my TV, I instead broke off the gold-plated sides of the inserts themselves. So...instead of being too tight, they are now extremely loose. lol. Oh well, the picture produced looks great. Great enough to warrant such defacement to a product? Umm...I don't think so. It's made for an Xbox. You'd be hardpressed to find anyone that can see a noticeable difference between these cables vs. any other component cables. Only buy these if you are a Monster fanboy. But be warned that you may have to do some modifications like I did or risk damaging your equipment."
5,Very good Xbox cables!!!,I love these cables!! I was surprised that they were thicker than I had anticipated but the quality of picture and sound that these cables can deliver is astonishing! I made a very good purchase with these!
3,"5 stars in advance, if not for the price...",I believe these cables will be excellent as most have enthusiastically stated in their reviews. So the only reason I give 3 stars is because of the PRICE.I JUST BOUGHT THESE ON EBAY FOR $9.99!!!! They are brand new and never opened in original container by a seller with the highest ebay rating.Just thought I'd share.
3,Great Monster product..,"I have both the MS component cables & the Monster 400 cables. With Monsters my picture quality increased by about 15%. I could clearly tell the difference between the Monster Brand & MS brand. The graphics in games are more detailed, you'll notice little things you missed prior to using monster cables.. Colors are more vibrant & black is really black.. That being said, these cables are a bit overrated. Monsters won't improve your picture quality a lot over the MS cables & they are over priced.. 60.00 for a 15% graphical upgrade might be a bit much for most people. But if you want the best picture possible get Monsters.. Ebay & Gamestop sells them for 40.00 or less, & to have DD 5.1 sound you must BUY an adaptor which is 30.00-40.00 bucks.. Yes, a bit much.. The Monster cables are overall sturdy, but the connectors seem to fall off quit easily, & stick like glue to my TV's rear component inputs.."
3,Tips are huge,"I had read previous reviews where the reviewers had stated that the connector tips were huge and got stuck or damaged connection ports. They were right. I have these cables plugged into aCables To Go 40697 6x2 Component Video, Stereo Audio and TOSLINK Digital Audio Matrix Selector Switch (Black)and they may just stay there, as they would not come out with a strong tug and I was afraid to pull too hard and damage the video matrix.As far as video and audio quality, it is very nice. The few Xbox games that support 480p or 720p/1080i seem to work nicely. If you have a modded Xbox and XBMC, these cables will allow upscaling of standard definition content to high definition."
5,Modded Xbox and HDTV? These are a must!,"Just as everyone else has mentioned, if you have an HDTV and a modded Xbox (for XBMC), this is a must have! If you have it, it's recommended by XBMC to only upconvert to 720p but you can also go to 1080i.And like all the other reviews, these suckers are tough to get on! One reviewer said to get some oils/lubricant but I was too lazy to go to the store to get some so I decided to try it without it. All you have to do is twist and wiggle (just a little bit) and they go in pretty easily. Do NOT try to force them in as I tried that at first...and you can really screw something up if you decide to keep pushing.Be sure to have the most current XBMC and set it to 720p (or 1080i if you'd like). Great product!"
1,terrible,"I don't normally write reviews, but this product is terrible. They actually managed to mess up sizing their component plugs, as they don't even fit snugly into my TV. I'd recommend avoiding the Monster cables and going with something else."
1,Worked fine for 2 weeks and boom,"I read a lot about this cables on the web. Seemed this were the best ones to resurrect my old Xbox on my 47"" LCD TV. They worked great for two weeks. Today the signal began to have distortions, the image was moving and then it was cut in half. At first I thought it was my TV, but it resulted it was the Monster Cable's fault. Now I have NO SIGNAL on my TV. If any one knows if this is normal and can be fixed please let me know. But by know I can tell you ""Don't buy this cables""."
4,Monster 5.1,"Plugging the red and white audio jacks intoyour receiver is not going to give you 5.1sound.They're analog out's.You need the opt-ical adapter to accommodate the toslink opt-ical cable to receive dolby digital.The onlyother way is through the coaxial digital inputon your reciever,but it's not as clean a con-nection as fiber optic."
3,Good but too expensive,"I have this Monster component cable and its proprietary optical cable (about $65 for both) and can say that it's the best connection you can find for your old XBOX. However, I can't really recommend them due to their high prices. If you can find the Microsoft HD pack, get that as it's much cheaper and accepts a generic optical cable. The only reason I bought this setup was because of their length (10 feet) which can go from one side of my entertainment center (where the xbox is) to the other side (where the stereo receiver is)"
3,Not worth the hassle,"These cables have always been too tight on any TV I've used them on. They're hard to get on, and even harded to get off. One of the component cables finally bit the dust after three or four years of use. I'm looking to replace them with a different brand.To their credit, the picture looked amazing while they worked."
5,Greatly Improves Existing Xbox Games,"First off as others have said the connectors are way to tight and you must be careful when plugging in or unplugging the cord as you may damage the TV. Other then that, this cable is great it makes games that are HD compatible look almost new. My TV is a Sony Bravia that is 1080P and the games look awesome even the ones that are not HD compatible look better. To test the cable I used X-Men Legends 2 and Silent Hill 2 (One is HD compatible and the other is not). The X-Men Legends 2 looks like it would be newer than what it is and Silent Hill 2 looks better but it still looks dated. Overall I am very pleased with this cable and as others have said my only complaint is the connectors are to tight."
3,A Three I suppose . . . I did finish it,"Bond's prose is weak, his characters are bordering triteness--how many times can two people (let alone reconciled lovers) choose virtue and then valiantly save the world--needless to say, the conclusion was conveyed around page 250 (the book consisted of some 450; if not prologue). As for plausibility: so the Saudi prince is Osama bin Laden? Since when does bin Laden meet with the American President for a good discussion on economics? One part I did enjoy was when the airport bomb went off and the American undersecretary was killed. Ironically, it had nothing to do with the story."
1,Larry Bonds worst,"As a fan of Larry Bonds' works I have to say I'm very dissappointed with ""Day of Wrath"". His other works ""Vortex"" and ""Cauldron"" are among my favorites of the genre but now that Mr. Bond has seen fit to dabble in the more unconventional aspects of warfare, his work has gone downhill. I believe that the chief villain known as the ""paymaster"" is based on an actual Saudi billionare living in the Sudan currently.This choice of villians would be interesting if the plot weren't so unoriginal. The ""loose nuke"" from the old Soviet Union is already highly over-done plot already used by authors of lesser quality. It's sad to see that he has reverted to using the same material. The ""Paymaster's"" final plan isn't even that original either, making ""Day of Wrath"" woefully predictable. Mr. Bond writes exellent conventional thrillers, he would be better off sticking to them."
1,The worst Bond I ever read,"When you're a fan of Larry Bond's writings, you've come to expect some thrilling storytelling, in which politics, the military and the individuals involved all interact to form a convincing plot.Then you read Day of Wrath, and you will be dissappointed. At first I thought that I have read some random B-espionage novel. But no, it is a Bond, only this time the author chose to further expand the appearance of colonel Thorne. While his first appearance was not bad at all, this novel seems like a quick-cashingprocedure.Avoid this one and buy some of the earlier novels by Larry Bond.A dissappointed fan from the Netherlands, who will give mister Bond one more chance."
2,Rambo with a Bachelor's Degree,"This is in no way up to the standard of Bond's other efforts such as Red Phoenix, Cauldron, and The Enemy Within. Things hum along pretty well until you get to the climax - then it deteriorates into the Rambo series. You know, one (in this case two)-people-against-an-army-good-thing-the-bad-guys-can't-shoot-straight type stuff. Good bathroom reading, that's about it."
1,Can't I give it zero stars?,"Larry Bond has Clancyitis. I thought things couldn't get much worse than ""Rainbow Six"", then I read this book. Bad characters, bad plot, bad everything. I had to force myself to read it all. How can this book follow ""Red Phoenix"" and ""Vortex""? Please Larry, don't mail the next one in!"
4,A page-turner of the first rank,"I ordered ""Day of Wrath"" and ""The Triumph and the Glory"" last week and have to say that they wree both very, very good books. Larry Bond has done better, though with some of his previous novels, this one was lacking a little in the credibility department and was a little uneven. "" The Triumph and the Glory"" is a thriller like Bond writes, but in more of a Herman Wouk style. At any rate, I would encourage you to read both of them."
3,Not Bad...but he's done better,"...another entertaining book from a good author but it lacks something. Certainly not on the same level as his earlier books; like Vortex and Red Phoenix. I will, however, read his next book when it comes out."
3,Bond writes another thriller that draws you into his world.,"Mr. Bond's latest book, Day of Wrath, weaves an interesting and plausible story of nuclear terror. He leads the reader through a series of twiss and turns as the two main characters, FBI Special Agent Gray and Army Colonel Thorn attempt to figure out why a plane carrying an American inspection team crashes in Russia. The all to plausible web of corruption and hate can raise the hair on your neck as you consider ""what if.""The plot is skillfully revealed. I found myself trying to figure out how ""the good guys"" would win the day. The plot gives a delightful twist to the typical genre hero by their own people making them rogue agents. I recommend this book to both the fan of techno-thrillers and the casual reader. This book is great for commuting to work as the passages are broken down with each chapter."
4,Exciting action thriller!,"I enjoyed this book! Sure the heros were super-heros to the max but what the heck, don't we all yearn to be super? The plot seemed well-researched. The premise was VERY scary. What if nuclear bombs were smuggled into the US by such an intelligent, wealthy, American-hating bad guy? A man who had the power to do whatever his twisted, evil heart wanted him to do. A man, too, who in his youth was given plausible reasons for his intense hatred of the West.Thorn and Gray had to rely on themselves and just a few trusted friends to save America, possibly the world, from certain disaster. The moral and professional dilemmas they had to face seemed all too real at times. Overcoming stupendous odds, they finally succeeded in saving themselves and the country. Good for them that in the process of doing so they were able to discover a deep love for each other. All fiction?.....you betcha! but ohh what a wonderful fiction it was!"
2,Two people avoid being caught/killed by the whole world,"Like many others, I loved Red Phoenix, but this one was just a bit too much. The two heroes manage to outwit EVERYONE gunning for them - bit like action films where the hero has one million bullets fired at them and all manage to miss. Fortunately, I didn't buy the book - only borrowed it - I certainly don't consider it value-for-money"
1,"Unimaginative, inconsistent, just plain bad.","Bonds' prior works focus on land/sea battles and are great reads. In Day of Wrath the intelligent, save-the-world characters can't make a straight line between 2 points on map. Stolen nuke, mole agent as a guide, lovers on the run, the Paymaster?? Please go back to novels on war."
2,A half-hearted effort,"I enjoy Mr. Bond's work very much, but 'Day of Wrath' was without doubt his worst book. His talents lie in describing epic sea/land battles between giant fleets and armies, not ""Will GI Joe and his FBI cutie-pie girlfriend find the time to love when they're not out shooting terrorists and saving the world?"".Please, Larry. Scrap the Thorn/Gray characters and write a real war book. Leave the ""Mack Bolan"" garbage to writers with lesser talents."
2,A Big Let Down,"I loved Red Phoenix, but this was a big let down! When you're saying outloud ""this is totally unbelievable"" while you're reading the book, you know that's a bad sign. Also, the romance angle did not work whatsoever and seemed like it was just thrown in. Larry Bond: go back to basics!"
1,A great book,A great book it had everything.Terrorists Royalty Russia Merecenaries.It was a great book.I hope they make #2.
1,horrible kindle transcription,"Probably would have been a decent read if it weren't for the atrocious and repeated errors in transcription to kindle format. It was obviously not proof-read the entire way through, as towards the second half of the book errors become more and more common until there are multiple errors in the same sentence. ""in"" become ""hi"", ""the"" becomes ""die"", etc., etc.To get a sense of how frustrating this is, re-read the above with the same transcription errors:Probably would have been a decent read if it weren't for die atrocious and repeated errors hi transcription to kindle format. It was obviously not proof-read die entire way through, as towards the second half of the book errors become more and more common until there are multiple errors hi the same sentence..."
1,Horrible Kindle Transcription,"I bought this book for my Kindle, having read the author before and enjoying his work. Much to my dismay, the Kindle version is riddled with typographical and transcription errors. There is probably at least one error per page, which is more than enough to distract while I am trying to read.The book seems OK, but I can't really tell because I can't read three sentences without having to change 'die' the 'the' in my head, or 'mat' into 'that' and on and on.Just don't buy the Kindle version."
3,Hated the love story; liked the thriller story.,"I miss the old Larry Bond. Vortex, Cauldron and Red Phoenix were amazing and filled in the gap when Tom Clancy lost his way. And now it seems that with this title and The Enemy Within, Bond has also decided to pander to the mainstream. The romance angle was distracting and unconvincing and cut from the same cloth as Harlequin. Having said that, once I forced myself past the first 100 pages or so, I really began to enjoy the story. I had to prepare myself for those awkward moments when the two characters were left alone, but a quick scan of the mush allowed me to get back to the story."
2,Distressed leather,"Was very disappointed in these shoes. They appear to be ""Distressed Leather"" which looks like crackle leather to me. They are not a bright bronze as pictured but muddy bronze. They need a better description for these shoes. If you like that look great. Would go with the type of clothing that looks worn - holes, rips etc. when new.Maybe for a teenager, not for me."
1,Unbelievably high reviews - These are awful,"I usually buy bulk labels from Uline but needed some in a hurry so I picked these up instead. I've only used half of them, if that, because they constantly get stuck in the feeder of my laser printer. I'm not a printer expert but the process of these going through the printer softens the label and thus it's not stiff enough to complete the pass through. Sometimes it works, but most times it doesn't. My other labels not specifically for laser, nor are they weatherproof, work consistently 100% of the time. These double my work and have left me hanging with many a package to ship. Major fail. Don't waste your time or money; just get regular labels from Uline.com"
5,Good Lead In,"The Star Wars universe is headed for a large change. The New Republic is no longer a fledgling government. This book is to be the first in the new style of Star Wars books, keeping the same excitement, but testing the government and the characters we have come to know. Age, Experience, and Unknown foes now combine with uncertain outcomes. No one is immortal."
1,how could they.........,"THEY KILLED HIM! although it is a well written book, i cant condone the killing of chewie, one of the best charactors in the star wars universe."
5,"No, Chewie, NOOOOOOOOOO","R. A. Salvator... You ought be ashamed of youself, killing Chewie like that. You should have at least let Chewie get in a few words (or howls, grunts, growls or whatever) so that Han wouldn't get drunk or anything. Yeesh. Other than the exeptionaly SAD part, this book was very good. If you love Chewie and can't imagine a world without him... read none of the New Jedi Order books, you will find them tear drippers I'm sure.From Obi-Wan Kenobi's greiving wife,Aur Revoir"
4,Easily one of the best,"By all means, I belive this is the best Star Wars novel I've ever read after Dark Apprentice. It captures the horror element and almost perfectly merges it with sci-fi and fantasy to ultimately form a sci-fi/thriller. The only thing keeping me back from giving this a Five-Star rating, is the solomn event of Chewbacca's untimely death. I just have one question for Mr. Salvatore. What prompted him to kill Chewie off anyway? He wanted to write the story enough? He liked the money offer? What? My other gripe about the book was that we didn't get enough background in some areas. A little more background on Nom Anor or the Yuuzhan Vong(Please note that if this is percieved as a plot spoiler, it was not intended). Other than that though, I found this to be action-packed, intense, and a great read for Star Wars fans and for fans of fantasy books and thriller books. I hope the second one lives up to the expectations created by the first. J.V.S."
1,review of new jedi order series,"This review is about the New Jedi Order series. In this very lengthy series of Star Wars books, some aliens (The Yuuzhan Vong) attack the Star Wars galaxy, killing many beloved characters and destroying many of the well-known planets. This series was so awful that I quit reading it about halfway through. I do not recommend this series."
1,Not Worth the Trouble,"The author's writing style has potential but the story itself lacks the substance that you find in both Stackpole and Zahn's books. It relies on dramatic emotional changes, instead of an intelligent plot and storyline to keep it interesting. The way that the author portrays situations in the book, is very clear but he lacks foundation in the story. On the whole I was disappointed and it is only worth reading if you want to keep up with the overall Star Wars universe."
1,Don't waste your time,"Sorry, as a Star Wars novel goes, the plot is loose, the writing is terrible, the characters hardly developed, and the authors knowledge of the Star Wars Universe seems sorely lacking. I am sorry to have even wasted the money on this. I am sorely disappointed in Lucas and those in his employ for even allowing this to go to print. As to those bantering about the death of a main character, sorry but I'm entirely opposed to it. I will not purchase any further novels by this author, as they are a waste of my time (This from a person who, if it has Star Wars anywhere on it, I buy it.)"
2,A Baseball Cap?!?,"Epilogue - Han takes out an old CAP which says ""it's a both"". WHO ARE YOU KIDDING? I have a hard time imagining Leia gave Han a hat with something like that on it. I am an adult and realize this merely fiction, but come on. What a stupid ending. If you are reading this one finish it quickly and get to Stackpole's two novels, they redeem the series."
3,The ending was ruined,"I just wanted to thank a few people for spoiling this books tragedy.Now to the review. This is my first Star Wars book that I've read. I found that this book started off a little too slow. Overall, I would say the book was a decent read, but don't go in with too high of expectations."
5,"Incredibly captivating book, stop whining!",I can't possibly think of a reason to not like this book. Salvatore once again proves himself to be one of the most imaginative and intelligent story tellers in any genre of fiction out there today. He is at the top of his game here and I can't wait to get my hands on anything new he writes in any story setting....Salvatore will come back to the series now and then to inject his unique writing stylings into the mix. It was a very good read.
1,A tough job -and he failed,"Well I finished the book last week and found it to be one of the poorest of the SW novels. I haven't read any of the Young Jedi series, so it's unfair to comment on the three Jedi youngsters, but I hardly recognised any of my beloved characters in this novel. Lando was a slimeball, Mara had none of her fire, and the rest of the well-known characters also lacked the recognised personalities. Before reading the book I didn't know about Chewie's demise and I hope desperately that he could make a return in the future, but I don't think he will. I won't dwell on this issue for long but I do think it's a shameless marketing ploy on the part of Lucasfilm and/or DelRey. I've read virtually all the SW novels, but this has to rate as a low. Apparantly the sequel is better, let's hope so! DEFINITELY skip this book if (like me) you're a Wookie fan."
1,Salvatore must not like Star Wars,I don't think Mr. Salvatore should continue writing Star Wars.Unfortunately for us he has to. Star Wars is a space opera not an intense drama. Killing off characters and warping others isn't my idea of a good writer.The book doesn't even refer back to other Star Wars books.However if you are a die-hard Star Wars fan you might enjoy this book.
2,This will be a book long remembered....,"...as the book that set the mood from the first page. Boring!! And really, did the author really need to kill of Chewbacca? I think Chewbacca was one of the funniest characters in the Star Wars Saga. What's with the lightsaber descriptions? Are they just a blade of energy or do they have some color? NO CHARACTER DESCRIPTIONS!! What does Bolpuhr look like? It seems that when a new character is introduced he is basically killed in the next twenty pages. Example: The Star Destroyer Commander. The map in the first two pages is completely useless. Where is Naboo? Where is Anoat? Where is Dagobah? But still a good read."
1,Vector's a Crime,"It disgusts me that as soon as Del Rey gets its Star Wars licenseback, they came out with Vector Prime. The story of the NewRepublic's battle against the Yuuzhan Vong begins with a disguised Yuuzhan Vong warrior wreaking havoc on a scientific research planet. The story goes on with the tale of this new species invading New Republic airspace. Many battles ensue, including one between Mara Jade and a Yuuzhan Vong warrior. I advise against reading this book. The story is choppy, the plot is pathetic, and the book is just plain boring. I hope R.A. Salvatore will do a better job on the novelization of Episode Two. Skip this, and read Timothy Zahn's Heir to the Empire."
4,Welcome New Jedi Order,"This is a great new book. The only major problem for me was what seemed to be a loboriously long set-up. It takes a little while for the book to get going, but when it does, it kicks it into high gear.The basic idea is that there is an invading extra-galactic warrior race coming to take over the galaxy with extreme prejudice. Then the heroes of Star Wars come to stop them.What makes this novel different, I believe, is the Solo children are finally growing up and being real Jedi. I think that Mr. Salvatore does a good job with these three. They have different personalities and aren't Luke clones.Next, is the death of a major character (you probably know who it is because most other reviews already ruined it, but I'm not saying who). It is disturbing at first, as it should be, but in the final pages the reason for it is revealed in the ""Eulogy."" I think the reasoning behind it is great, but I'm still a little sad.Get this book and read it, you'll not be disappointed."
3,A hard read,"I have to saw the latter part of the book was better. It was hard to start and get use to the way it was written, but about half way through it started clicking and went better."
4,Young Writer Shows Great Promise,"This was a very strong book that one senses has set up a series of great plots for the future editions of the New Jedi Order. It took some time to set up, but once it got going it became an excellent novel. The book's major new enemy has great potential in the future, and acts as a clear foil to the ususal band of characters that follow the storyline as it unfolds. A must have for any Star Wars bookshelf."
3,good story-bad characterization,"If you want a great SW novel with fresh new villains and tense action, than this book is for you. If however, you are into great stories that develop and extend the range of a character then don't waste your time with this novel, especially if you are a fan of the Young Jedi Knight series. Stackpole has totally rewritten the characters of the Solo children and frankly, the Anderson's created much more beliveable and likable kids than Stackpole has."
4,"Is good, but sad","This book is a very good book, but the part that is most sad is when chewie died.Why he died? Another thing that I want to said is: When Luke and Mara are going to have any children? Well, this book is good, so read it."
5,Blew away all my expectations,"I have to admit that when I started this book, I wasn't too thrilled. It sounded too much to put in a 350 page book. However I found the book well paced and everything needed to make a good Star Wars book.It was nice to at least see the Solo kids front and center after what I consider the mediocre appearence of those kids in the Young Jedi Knight series. The new alien technology was very interesting and has plenty of potential. The only thing that I could have done without was Mara's disease. It did not advance the story at all for me and it would be a shame if she died."
1,Chewbacca should live,I hated this book and believe they should never have killed Chewbacca what a disapointment Chewbacca was the best.
1,Wait a second!,"Okay, I haven't read this book yet, but from some of the other reviews, I have learned, that Chewbacca dies! Chewbacca is one of my favorite characters, he can't die! And anyways Mr. Salvadore or whatever havn't you read Kevin J. Anderson's and Rebecca Moesta's books - Young Jedi Kights, Chewbacca's alive in them and unless I'm mistaken which I don't think I am, young Jedi Knights, comes after Vector Prime. I was going to read this book, but frankly, now I don't think I want to. I am very dissapointed!"
1,GEORGE LUCAS -- GIVE THE FICTION CONTRACT BACK,"When I read that the fiction contract had gone to DelRey - I said ""I have a bad feeling about this."" And this book proves it. It is too bad that we can't give negative stars because I would this book them. I was totally disgusted with so many things about this book it would take pages to state them so I will say that I feel like the Star Wars universe has died and I am in mourning. All the idealism, the hope and the fantasy are missing here. The book seem to last forever and the beloved chaaracters seem like puppets. The force was missing and so was the mysticism. A BIG MISTAKE. DelRey/Lucas Books are you listening?"
2,Barely better then the rest of the novels,I can not for the life of me understand how anyone likes the Star Wars novels. They rehash plots and dialog and lack originality. Vector Prime at least attempts to bring new life to this sad series and barely accomplishes that. I guess if you are a 13 year old boy or an adult in arrested development you might enjoy this.
2,"Entertaining story, but terrible writing","I am a sucker for anything in the Star Wars milieu and the overall arc of the plot is very compelling and kept me engaged. But this was a terribly written book. It's so bad I found it distracting; I wanted to get out a red pen and make corrections. The plot too goes off or seems especially silly--even suspending your disbelief far enough to get you into a Star Wars novel. I'm not just talking about the famously controversial plot turn, which although satisfying has a certain authenticity to it. But many of the characters actions just don't make much sense. I put the book down several times in frustration."
2,Disapointing,"This book was a severe disapointment to me and any real star wars fan. The plot was acceptable but was still not to the level of Timothy Zahn. Furthermore, Salvatore has killed of one of the orignal Star Wars characters. To any possible readers, I suggest that you don't waste your time."
1,Are you people nuts or just blind?,"If I could give this book no stars, I would in a heartbeat. This book was most likely THE WORST Star Wars novel I've read since the Black Fleet Crisis. Never should a new author be allowed to do such horrid things to the Star Wars universe. Thank God for Michael Stackpole, who is rehabilitating the storyline for the New Jedi Order arc with his usual skill and flare. Salavatore should NOT be writing any more Star Wars novels, in my opinion."
1,"Utterly boring, utterly idiotic, utterly ostentatious","This is one of the most horrible books I have read in my lifetime; and yes, I managed to read the whole book. Why I wasted my time I'm not sure. I'm sure Salvatore can write well, but some authors can adapt to the SW universe and some can't (Salvatore being one of the later).That a particular character died was not the problem. Nor was the new enemy (though I think we all miss the Imperials). The book was just not suspenseful, not compelling, the characters weren't very well developed/captured...<sigh>. Part of the problem is that no author has yet given the Solo children well-written, interesting characters. Yes, they've been characterized, but they're not yet -characters-. Just works-in-progress (not even people in progress)."
3,Too Fast & Too Slow,"This book is an ""OK"" attempt at starting up the series, but it just doesn't even compare to the rest of the NJO books.Characters and alien terms are just thrown at you way to quickly, while the story itself is slow-paced.It would probably be okay to read it after you've read a few of the later books in the series, but it's not really a good place to start."
5,Star Wars + Salvatore = AWESOME!!!!!,"Being a big fan of Star Wars, especially the expanded universe, and a huge fan of R.A. Salvatore's writing, I was excited to read this book! The story is a big leap for the Star Wars universe, going in a totally new direction with a threat that even the Jedi find nearly impossible to handle.I don't want to give too much away to anyone who hasn't read this book yet, but Salvatore is the perfect author to write the farewell of a beloved Star Wars character. This is my favorite book in The New Jedi Order series. However, if you have not read any other Star Wars novels, you might be lost when it comes to some of the characters. If this is the case, start with ""Heir to the Empire"" by Timothy Zahn. This is the first book in a trilogy that will intoroduce you to important characters like Mara Jade, Jacen and Jaina Solo, Gilad Paelleon, Grand Admiral Thrawn, and the Noghri."
5,was looking forward to the rest of the series,i learned about the series from a friend who said that he didnt like it much and i must say after reading the first book i was amazed that he could say such a thing. After reading this first book (which i finished in about two days) i couldnt wait to read the rest of the series.The Yuuzhan Vong are a species from a differant universe who believe that the expanded universe was promised to them by the gods. They are a violent race of beings who use bio-technology and their sole occupation is war.Without a doubt this is the best SERIES that i have read from the entire expanded universe.This book is a must
2,"Good SciFi, Bad Star Wars & Bad Editing",I had a bad feeling when those who now control the Expanded Universe decided to kill Chebacca. They had a good idea to pump something new in the EU with an invasion from outside the galaxy. So here is SW fans were left with - A series of prequel books and movies that must necessarily be dark... and a new series NJO that starts off dark. Why was it also necessary to kill beloved characters?
1,Necessary but not enjoyable,"Although Star Wars fans will want to read this book as it is the kickoff of the New Jedi Order series, they shouldn't expect much out of it quality-wise. The writing is poor, the viewpoints change without warning and the dialogue is stiff and unbelievable. However, it contains the introduction to our heroes' new enemy, the Vong, and a wealth of information that is helpful upon reading later books."
1,Worst Star Wars Book Ever,"This is by far the worst Star Wars book ever written. I've read almost all of them including the short story selections. This one is typical of R.A. Salvatore original characters suddenly become stupid while Salvatore's characters are perfect and the only smart people around. There are much better books out there in the Star Wars Universe. Try the Truce at Bakura, Tales of the Bounty Hunters, Tales from Jabba's Palace, Tales from Mos Eisley Cantina, or the Courtship of Princess Leia. All are much better without Salvatore's lame characters."
2,That about wraps it up.,"Mr. Salvatore's book is good,however when you combine it with EP1, it starts to paint a very lousy picture of where the Star Wars Universe is heading. I think that now is probably a good time to say goodbye to this once great achievement. I believe that Mr. Lucas has forgotten where the interest in these stories came from. I hope Micheal Stackpole and Dark Horse continue with Star Wars, because they seem to have the right innovations needed to keep it fresh."
1,Thank you for ruining the book!,I would like to thank all the morons who RUINED this book for myself and others when reviewing it on here and revealing the MAJOR death of one of the characters! Good Job!
1,Lets not count this one and remember Vision of the Future,"Ummmmm...... NO, shallow characters, poor plot, ooh a deadly disease for mara (like it won't be cured), the death of chewie (Chewie? brainiac), and an Alien race wanting to rule the galaxy..... ORIGINAL! I'll skip the next one. Where oh where has Tim Zahn gone?"
2,Bleah -- reviewing the New Jedi Order series,"Not enough Star Wars. Too many authors.We have about 20 books from the New Jedi Order series, and the first thing that you notice is the lack of continuity -- in story line, characterization, technology, weaponry... it's a mess. Using Star Wars character names makes the stories more aggravating, but it probably makes the books more marketable.If you are a hard core Sci-Fi person who reads indiscriminately, well -- these are books, all right. You can read them.Some authors do a better job than others with writing stories -- Timothy Zahn, for one example -- but out of the entire series, the bright spots are few."
3,"Interesting technology, juvenile dialog","The first book in the new order series features a new extra-galactic enemy, that brings with it a fascinating new biological technology. Unfortunately, I found myself continuing to read further just to see what new technologies were introduced, and not because I cared about the characters. The dialog between the characters was predictable and juvenile, and the plot just sort of dragged me along instead of beckoning me further. All in all, not one of Salvatore's best works."
3,vector prime,"this book was slightly disappointing for me. i already knew the big surprise, so that kind of ruined it. the new aliens were great, but it was missing some of the main characters"
3,Skeptical,"I don't know. You see, like the big man George Lucas himself, I'm quite skeptical about letting others take the Star Wars galaxy into their own hands. I'm not much of a fan of the Star Wars novels, but I do, however, read them quite frequently; after all, I'm still a Star Wars fan. However, no author (not even the mighty Tim Zahn himself) can match the style of the movies. Salvatore, in my opinion, was quite far off in imitating the style of Lucas. As most of you know Chewbacca dies in Vector Prime. Although I feel the scene was very well written and had much meaning, it's something Lucas would never do to such a well-developed and loved character. It just isn't his style. But hey, what do I know? I'm just gonna stick with Lucas when it comes to Star Wars."
1,Total Dreck!,"Salvatore has no sense of the characters or society of the Star Wars universense; no talent for plotting (too much exposition, too little action, major plot points--e.g., Mara's illness--dumped on the reader with no setup, no tension or emotional affect--he kills a major character & it has absolutely no impact on either the storyline or reader) and an extremely mealy-mouthed attitude toward violance (e.g., ships don't blow up--they just 'go away');"
1,Bah! Stick with fantasy Salvatore!,"I have read the Crystal Shard series from Salvatore back in 1989 and loved it. I have read the Star Wars series ever since the Zahn series. This should have been the best novel yet. But Salvator only rehashes the same story lines that have been beaten to death in previous books. There is little imagination, what little there is is far fetched. If I tell you that this book is about an evil force threatening the Republic, you say ""yeah, so? We've seen that in every book!"" He has the big death of Chewie in this book. Something like this should be monumental. You should remember this like you remember when JFK was shot. But instead, it is an akward, messy moment. We don't have time to grieve Chewie. The whole book is rushed to get to the death of Chewbacca, and when we get there, we are in a hurry to get done with it."
1,no consistancy,"I love Star Wars. This was a shallow picture of the SW Universe. It had a contrived ending, more like Star Trek when you try the trinitron burst from the Sony zappalizer to bring all to a conclusion. And the lead character in the beginning of the novel was supposed to be a warrior but acted like a coward, stabbing everyone in the back. Luke, Han and the rest were one dimensional. Only good part of the book was the Starwars timeline and map."
1,For Mandi and others that think it is fine killing of Chewy,Chewbacca shouldn't have been killed. All of the characters people have listed have been in 3 or 4 stories tops. Chewbacca has been in the story line for dozens of stories. He went through the movies and all the way to this book. And another thing Star wars is Science fiction and mythological. In those types of stories someone doesn't get killed for making and important decisive action. The author wrote the book as a horror story not a Science Fiction story. This guy did a horrible job on the book. The next book should bring chewy back some how.
3,An R rated story in a PG rated universe,"Reading this book reminded me of another Star Wars book, The Truce At Bakura. I was shocked that Lucas let such a violent and gruesome book be published as a Star Wars title. I am equally if not more so shocked with R. A. Salvatore's story. The book is very well written and Mr Salvatore has definitely done his Star Wars Universe homework, but it's too violent and graphically gruesome a story and I dont' feel such stories have a place in the Star Wars universe. Just my opinion."
2,Horror instead of traditional Star Wars,"I can tell that Salvatore's previous books were horror books. He is never able to marry his horrific plot and the traditional Star Wars plot. If you remove any pretenses of Star Wars, you have a horror story with characters slaying people with axes. I was very disappointed. The notable characteristics of Han Solo, and Leia were altered, and the plots involving Solo & Leia were too comical. The omnipotence of 'The Force' was absent from this book. I think more previous research from the Bantam books should have occurred. I hope that the future Del Rey books remain with the traditional plots, characters, feel, and atmosphere of Star Wars Sagas."
1,Poor,"I should have been warned by the TPM novelization, which used a good fantasy author to absolutely no effect. I have never read Salvatore's other work--to judge by his reputation, it can't possibly be as bad as this. The book is limp, full of errors, botched characterizations, and villains that are straight out of Ming the Merciless. Just awful. Did the publisher know it was bad? Sure they did, because perhaps the only good section of the book was the one they chose to excerpt on the net and in print. They imagined, I suppose, that quality didn't matter, because hype is all. Wrong again. A dire beginning for the NJO."
3,A lukewarm Sprite . . .,"That's kind of what I felt like I'd just consumed after reading Vector Prime. I can't quite put my finger on it. It's not because of a certain character's demise, or because we have a new enemy. I don't quite know what it is, except that well, a spacerace in an asteroid field drags on too long. Maybe it's that large portions of this book drag on too long. I don't know. But all I can suggest is that you skip this book, move on to Dark Tide I (an awesome book and good entry point into New Jedi Order), and find out who dies from any one of a thousand rabid fans looking for Salvatore's head on a platter ..."
3,"Patience. Next book not far, not far!","All i have to say is this. I agree Salvatore went a little over board with Chewie's death and Luke and Mara's marraige. But I have to admit the book was pretty good and creative, and worthy of the 'Star Wars' title. I am looking forward to the next book and you should be too. And remember: *The Force will always be with you.*"
1,Another reason why Lucas should write his own books,"I eagerly bought this book because I ADORE Salvatore's ""Icewind Dale"" trilogy....but he should stick to drow and not Jedi. I keep reading the ""Star Wars"" followup novels in hopes that somebody will do justice to Lucas' masterpieces, but with the notable exceptions of Timothy Zahn, Brian Daley, and Crispin, they're AWFUL, and this one is no exception. Killing off Chewie is only the tip of the iceberg....if a character HAD to be offed, WHY OH WHY couldn't it be the annoying C3PO? Don't waste your time."
1,shut him up or shut him down,"first off you used the wrong phrase, shut him up or toss him out it is shut him up or shut him down. if you screw that up alone you should not write star wars. and allston and stockpole may have done fantasy but at least they do a nice job at star wars unlike you salvatore who writes close to horror novels. yes its nice to have a new enemy besides the empire it about time. their like the hun or the turks not indians and romans. as for the death of chewbacca thats why you create other main characters yo kill off you always need a core of people. but yes th young jedi knights are for but the old crew still has alot of time in this universe."
1,Star Wars Vector Prime,"I have always liked Star Wars, but the auther messed up a lot of things in this book. Such as killing Chewbacca. It's like none of the Jedi's realy used the force except to check to see if one of their friends were enjured. And Anikin Solo could have used the force to raise Chewie up into the air and into the falcon. And then like I would be reading one curtain thing then the next chapter. The auther wrote something that had nothing to do with what had happened already or what never really happen. It was like a shock trying to figuer out what your were reading.This is the worse Star Wars book I have ever read. The others are pretty good. And not only that the auther took 2/3 of the book till there was really any thing good happening."
2,Did Salvatore fish this out of a dumpster?,"This was without a doubt, THE WORST book I have ever read!The author had NO feel for the characters, NO familiarity in the SW genre, and frankly NO writing style.You killed Chewie. How dare you just waltz into a genre that you don't belong in and kill off one of the best characters?And what is with the Vong? Did he even READ anything about the nature of the Force? Life creates the Force. The Vong shouldn't be invisible on in, if anything they should RADIATE the Force since everything they have is biological in nature.Ugh, this was just so terrible, I had to FORCE myself to finish reading it.Do yourself a favor and pass this one by."
2,what have they done?,"like the phantom menace movie, this is one of those star wars episodes i wish they could just take back. while many of the events that take place in the book are meaningful for the series as a whole, the writing is flawed, the delivery poor. mara suffers especially as a character (altho this is in no measure exclusive to this book), as does her relationship with luke. the storyline itself, while introducing the newest and greatest threat to the new republic, is not in itself significant except for the death of a principle character. the depiction of the Yuuzhan Vong also lacks depth. after the amazing hand of thrawn duology, this book the biggest disappointment of the written series. unfortunately, i can't recommend skipping it, for it has enough information to merit reading if you i intend to continue reading the new series."
2,Not because of the Wookie!,"Vector Prime is my 5th book to read in the Star Wars expanded universe, and I gotta say this book isn't worth anyone's time. Its not the fact that Chewbacca dies, but the fact that the sotry doesn't really go anywhere at all. You think its getting better, and then the plot goes down hill from there. After you've read this one, you feel as if Star Wars has stooped to an all time low, but I hear the next one's by a new author, so don't dispair."
2,disappointing,"This novel disappointed me for several reasons:1) the way the New Republic defeats the Praetorite Vong by freezing their underwater base makes no sense. By that I mean that it's a violation of physics laws. No big deal maybe, since a lot of physical laws are already mistreated by the Star Wars universe, but still: the idea is absurd.2) it's dark. I personally find it too dark for a Star Wars novel. The good-spirited Star Wars movies seem to me very different from the dark tone of this novel.3) some details make no sense: how can the Solo kids be Jedi knights at their young age? Is killing a lot of enemies with a lightsaber and displaying acrobatic skills in starfighter piloting the only skills required to be a Jedi knight?4) it's poorly written. Sorry, maybe I'm asking for too much, but compared to other Star Wars novels, I find both the style and the vocabulary poor.Overall I would not recommend this novel."
4,At last one of them dies !,First of all let me say that this was an enjoyable book and was good to read. Second to all those who are moaning about Chewie dying its about time one of the main chracters died and personaly I think salvatore could have got rid off some other charachters as well e.g Kyp durron and Lando for instance. This was well written with agood theme although not completley original (evil aliens).One thing that did get on my nerves though was that Han and Chewie were treated as incomptents when piolting in the astroids(Author has not seen ESB then) Plus the Solo children are annoying to say the least as these arrogant young do gooders who need to be taken down a step.And did not Yoda say Adventure Excitment a Jedi craves not these things. But other wise a good book.
3,Salvatore's juggling act doesn't quite add up.,"I read the first 150 or so pages of this Book and really enjoyed it, then I read the rest of the book and my attitude changed. In my opinion, Salvatore is trying to juggle too many characters in one novel, and does a fair job at best of doing so. You have Luke and the original gang from the movie, the Solo kids, the YV's, Danni, Kyp and it is just doesn't work. Many times throughout the story I thought, ""Come on, this just doesn't cut it."" In any book, you have this bubble of believability that the author should stay in, for if he ventures out of this bubble, the story begins to crack. My other major complaint is the poor characterization of Luke and Mara, and their relationship together. Timothy Zahn set us all up with a great ""Vision of the Future"", and it seems that in the first book of the NJO series we are let down."
2,Didn't Feel Like Star Wars,"The Yuuzhan Vong come off to me as a Drow Priestess combined with two Star Trek races: ""The Borg"" and their biological enemies from fluidic space. Basically a human shaped fanatical sado-maschochistic relentless soldier race who aren't too smart and use engineered organisms as their tools. They work to forcefully assimilate the rest of the universe into obedient organic-technology.This new story arc introduces collectivist ideology, but at the price of losing the mystique of the Star Wars universe.Vector Prime reminded me of fan fiction. No narrative drive, no character depth, and too many viewpoints (Luke, Jacen, Mara, Leia, Jaina, Han Solo, C9PIO, Chewie, Daniela Quinn, Anakin II, Yuuzan Vong bad guys #1 and #2 etc...).The fights scenes were the high points of this flat pulp fiction book, but not even the major character death could emotionally reach me. It just didn't feel like Star Wars."
2,TOTALLY DISAPPOINTING,"Salvatore really did a good job of messing everybody up. And why the heck did Chewie have to die? I mean, come on! This was probably one of the worst Star Wars books i have ever read! Oh well........ At least Stackpole's written the new book. He's at least better than Salvatore. GOD! THe plot was messed, though I rather enjoyed the Yuuhan VOng, cuz they're completely resistent to the FORCE!Also, Mara Jade, Han Solo, all of them were messed up! DON'T BOTHER EVEN READINGTHISBOOK! I reccommend all of the Timothy Zahn books, especially his Hand of Thrawn Duology."
2,Disappointing to say the least,"I bought this book back in 1999 when it was first released and I barely got 100 pages into it before giving up. I just didn't like the book and as a result I never really got into the New Jedi Order series. Recently I decided to give the book, and the series, another try. This time I did manage to finish the book, but didn't like it any better. It took me three days to get through the last 80 or so pages. The Solo children are portrayed like spoiled children who are in desperate need of discipline. Han, Leia and Luke have become boring old people, even though they are supposed to be only in their 40's and 50's. Plus the battle scenes could put you to sleep. I'm not sure if it was Mr. Salvatore's writing or the storyline that I didn't like. I'll have to read a couple of the other books in the series before I make my final judgement on the series, but I sure do hope they are better than the first installment."
4,A Wonderful Addition To The Star Wars Library,"I was very skeptical about buying this book. I thought I'd try waiting for the paperback..but as a long-time Star Wars fan who's read everything else in print, I couldn't help myself. I wasn't dissappointed on the whole. It was more sophisticated than some of the other novels have been, which is a welcomed change. I loved the discussions about the role of the Jedi, now that thier numbers are increasing. Luke came off a bit wooden for me, though. Lots of action, some new faces. Also, It's good to see Leia finally step down;it's unrealistic to have her president for so long (this IS a democracy, isn't it?) Unfortunately, it seems that she is still the only being in this entire galaxy who can govern worth a hoot. It's too bad the New Republic has so little talent other than our Heros. Anyway, it was a fun read, and that's what it's all about anyway, isn't it? Looking forward to the next one..."
3,A main character lost in the most reduculas situation.,"The heading is the best way to describe the way in which one of the greatest characters in the Star Wars universe. My wife summed up the situation, I told her of the lose of the character, and she wanted to know how the character died. I told her... she laughed and said ""Are you serious?"". That is when I also realised that it was REDICULAS. What a absolutly stupid way for the character to die. A moon fell on him... yep...I'll be mentioning that to others.. NOT! I think I'll make up my own story for the character's death...something just a little more realistic."
3,Not the best but is still pretty good,Decent book starts off the New Jedi Order well but the book is slow and is simply not as well written as the Zahn books.Don't start here if you've never read the Star Wars novels. Star with the Thrawn Trilogy.
1,Disappointing read,"To me the only thing that saved this book was the major event that should have happened long ago but didn't, won't go into details for those who haven't read it yet. The characters were two dimensional lacking personality and the Solo twins played to large of a role for me to stomach. I'm a major fan of the X-wing series so the lack of Wedge cost this book a two star rating and the thought of Jaina replacing him as the primary X-wing pilot in the SW series is a frightening one. The book even goes as far to potray Han and Chewie as a pair of bumbling idiots in a cockpit. That was a major insult to their characters and to us the readers that have known them since they first found their way to the screen. Basically this book has limited value, you get to know the new villians and you get the long delayed event that is one of the books few bright points. Other than that it was a hugh disappointment."
3,"Good introduction, bad plot holes","This book is a good introduction to the njo series, but is really only remembered for killing off a certain character. The prose is average, the dialogue is slightly below average, the overall story arc is ok, and certain plot points contradict either science or facts from the later novels in the series. The book does, however, do a good job of setting up the premise for the series. New Jedi Order is a series with soaring high points (Matt Stovers ""Traitor"" and Troy Dennings ""Star by Star"" to name a couple) and points of utter mediocrity. This is one of the latter, but still worth reading if you want to experience the beginning of this massive series. Just dont be turned off to the series by this book. It gets a lot better."
5,Excellent story,"At first I was'nt really into reading this book.Starts off kind of slow, but the author is setting up the scenery. At one point I was ready to give up the book, but I decided to give it a chance and read further. Well I'm glad I did. The Jedi have met their match with these Yuz Vong warriors.This book is worthy lol. I still don't know why the author decided to get rid of a long time Star Wars character. I am still mourning. I plan on purchasing Onslaught next and hope to see that character miraculously brought back to life.Once the story gets going, you will not want to put it down.Overall I do give this book 5 stars."
1,"Might as well wing it....or ...there's no there, there....","If you were looking for a travel book that told you as little as possible about what you were visiting and ignored significant sites in the cities it covered, then this book is for you. In all seriousness, I was astounded that a travel book with so little substance and insight can actually be published. Do yourself a favor and stick with the Fodors, Frommers, Rough Guides, etc."
2,"Whistle good, but compass & thermometer stink!","I thought ""gee, a 3-in-1 combination, how great"" - but when I got the whistle and messed around with it for a bit I found thata) the compass is pretty crappy - bubbles (or perhaps the liquid used?) prevented it from spinning freely. Given some shaking and multiple attempts it ""sort of"" worked - but wouldn't want to depend on it at all in a ""real"" situation.b) The thermometer is also kind of crappy - I didn't do an exact measurement, but it was reporting >5 degrees off of the temperature reported by 2 other instruments.The whistle portion is fine...Also - my bad for not noticing, but the product is ~$3 and it seems like the shipping is ~$4...so this seems like one of those things you *don't* want to order on your own (like I did without paying attention - thought it qualified for my ""prime"" shipping, oh well).-J"
3,Worked while it lasted....,It functioned as expected until it broke. The sprayer broke off from the base and now must be replaced.
2,Handy little product that DOESN'T last,"Alas, this is one of those great little products that could be FANTASTIC, if only it were made better. Bought one in November, only to have to replace it in February. Now here we are in August, and it's broken again. I will be moving on to a different product in the hopes of finding more longevity."
4,Great swivel faucet aerator esp. if you don't have separate sprayer,"I had used one of these in my last kitchen faucet, but couldn't find a replacement locally when I moved. Didn't leak then (2+ years). Harder water may erode the parts more quickly. Installed this one in new kitchen. No issues to date (couple months). We like this swivel aerator for 2 reasons: 1) It's more shallow than other swivel aerators (closer to the faucet head, allowing more clearance to fill tall pots), and 2) it reverts to the default stream position when you turn off the faucet. (Deliberate design--but I can see how it's not for everyone.) This aerator is an acceptable alternative to installing a separate sprayer (which we can't because of the faucet type)."
5,Exactly perfect!,"Aerator and Sprayer is perfect for me. If you have a bit of a leaking problem, a little Teflon tape will do the trick! Make sure you put the Teflon tape in the direction that it screws. I don't care that it goes back to stream each time it is turned back on. That is what is is supposed to do! :o) I really like its 'low profile,' too."
3,Sink sprayer,"Smaller than I was expecting. The adapter I bought works great, but I would have preferred a spray with wider coverage"
3,"Pretty, but sometimes frustrating to use","I like the full swivel action of this sprayer and the fact that it stays where you point it, unlike those cheap rubber slip-on sprayers. I don't like that it goes back to stream mode every time you turn it off, every time you bump it, and every time the water pressure goes low enough. I bought it knowing that it probably has a short life span, and when it dies, I'll replace it with something else."
4,Functional,We have a shallow appt kitchen sink so I chose this one after reading a bunch of reviews on similar products. Works great. Just wish it would spray a wider radius but works good enough for me.
3,Works great for 8 months,"I found this item worked great for about 8 months, then it falls apart. The design has a rubber piece that the unit slids in and out of, after many months of use I guess it just wears and then the spray unit pops off and gets water all over the place. Not useable after that. So, if you don't mind replacing it often, I guess it is good. I bought a 2nd one, it did the same thing. So, a design flaw."
3,"Nice looking, but has some flaws","The pros on this sprayer are: good looking, nice compact size - doesn't detract from the look of your faucet or sink. Cons: defaults back to stream when you turn it off, I would prefer it stayed where you set it (spray or stream). That's not that big a deal. But the biggest con for me is it doesn't swivel well on spray, the automatic diaphragm is too sensitive and keeps wanting to go back to stream mode . Bottom line: looks nice but I probably will buy something else next time."
1,Lasted 2 weeks,This only lasted me two weeks. There is only a skinny piece of plastic that connects the head to the base and it broke off from regular use. The swivel range as stated in another comment is very limited. I would not pay this money again for a faucet that lasts only 2 weeks before falling apart.
1,bad,"nice looking, but reduce the water flow too much. Imediately I changed for a different brand.I dont recomeded it."
3,Worked great for four months...,"A cheap unrepairable plastic piece in the center of the faucet broke in four months. Until then it worked well, but I would look for a sturdier unit."
3,"Danco 36325B Swivel Aerator and Sprayer, Chrome","Good Looking. Nice Swivel. Power Stinks because it's a water saver and there is nothing you can do about it on this model. If you are looking for something with good force and power, this is not for you. Instead of returning it, I gave it to my mom. She is happy with it."
3,Works well while it lasts.,"I noticed similar reviews from others and the same experience here. The two pieces of the swivel are connected with a very small thin piece of plastic. Over time heat degrades the plastic as heat does with everything it touches. Depending on how much you use it will break. Mine lasted 8 months. I bought another because it does have a low profile and does't hang low in the sink. Other swivels are much longer, making it hard to get some things under."
4,"Entertaining, intriguing, lengthy","I enjoyed this book. Yes, it's long, confusing, and full of intricate historical detail. It's also fascinating if you give it half a chance. I think it could use a series of family trees to clarify all the relationships. It's fun reading though. It contains a lot of things to ponder and mull over. Definately appealed to my intellectual side."
5,One of my favorites,"Katherine Neville was here on her book tour last year. I am of partly Basque heritage and I was pleased to learn that she's doing research on the Basques in America. She's spent a lot of time in the Basque regions of Spain, too. I'm astounded by how much research she does, so it didn't surprise me that Magic Circle is now one of my favorite books. I'll have to read her others while I'm waiting for the next one to come out."
1,Completely forgettable,"I found this book on my bookshelf and thought - hmm, must have missed this one. I read the synopsis, was immediately drawn in, and wondered why it had taken me so long to get around to reading it. So I started reading. Things seemed somewhat familiar. I thought that maybe I had started this once upon a time and for whatever reason wasn't able to finish. I read on. 300 pages, 350 pages - geez is this deja vu or what?! It seriously took me around 400 pages to realize I had in fact already read the whole book! I NEVER forget plots or stories! Never say never. So I had to finish it after putting in all the hard yards - what a convoluted and verbose piece of rubbish! It's so completely far-fetched. If Katherine Neville ever read a history book it was about as memorable to her as The Magic Circle was to me the first time around. So if you haven't read this - don't bother and if you can't remember, best to leave it forgotten."
1,Contrived and ridiculous,"I enjoyed Neville's other books, but this one left me cold. It wasn't that I couldn't finish the book, I just didn't want to. It was a convoluted mish-mash that made me feel like the author was trying to impress me with her vast store of arcane knowledge. I was not impressed."
1,I felt ripped off!,"I usually like books that force me to keep track of lots of characters, ideas, etc. -- I like the challenge of staying on top of it all. But this got to a point where, towards the end, when she would go off on some historical tangent, I would just skim it because I was losing hope that it was really going anywhere. I finished it only because I thought there was going to be some revealation at the end that would make it all worth it. I was so disappointed! I think she just crammed the book full of every historical fact, myth and legend she'd ever heard of."
5,I re-read The Magic Circle and enjoyed it even more!!,"If one is interested in history, cycles of nature, heterogenity and finding out all about the world's myths and legends than The Magic Circle will take you on a ride you will never forget. This novel is not just a meal - it is a full course dinner with brandy in the library after. The characters comprise a salon of original, diverse and stimulating people. I now feel as though I know them even better. I hope Neville will grace us with more about Ariel and herglobal family in future novels."
1,DIDN'T ENJOY THIS...NOT ENTERTAINING,"I don't know what all the excitement is about this book. The style and pace was very boring to me and didn't really excite or thrill me very much. The plot seemed horribly confusing and very hard to follow and the ending was cold and incomplete. For me, this was not a pleasant experience."
1,Where's my kitchen sink?,"Oh, Katherine Neville took it and put it in her book -- She thought it was missing something! It seems like every thought or idea or bit of information Neville ever came across in her entire life is crammed into this book! I'm a careful reader, but I couldn't keep it straight by the end. Was it really possible that the main character turned out to be related to absolutely EVERYONE else in the book? Am I related to her?"
3,Please get rid of the history....,"I read the first book of Katherine Neville and thought this one might turn out good. Instead, the history part of the book was kind of obscure and didn't seem to conjure the whole story. There were some interesting characters but overall the story was shabby related and lack the focus of a main theme."
5,Best book! Great summer reading,"The Magic Circle is quite possibly the best book I have ever read. Personally, I found it even better than Eight... - Yes folks, I had my doubts too, I did not think it possible at first, but its true. Treat yourself to this rare intellectual satisfaction."
1,VERY VERY DIFFICULT BOOK TO UNDERSTAND,"After reading through the book twice I have come to the sadconclusion that the book is too confusing and illogical to appreciate.Maybe to some, the whole ideal of a magical theme through the ages can be appreciated, but to me, it was just too hard to follow. I thought the adventures from the early Christian people was interesting, but they ended far to abruptly and without any good reason."
5,I - LOVE - IT!,"This was one hell of a book. the way Neville mixed present and past, fact and fantasy.... By the time i was halfway through, i was desparately hoping for Sam and Ariel to get together, and so when he met Bambi, i was thinking ""what?' But everything turned out perfect! This book had some very funny bits and observances- and Olivier is very runny! The family bits were the bits i liked the most- finding twists in the story... marvellous!"
1,SO MUCH MISSED POTENTIAL,"What a very original idea for a plot. I thought the idea of immersing the reader into two plot lines, one historic and one modern day, would be intriguing and delightful. I tried very hard to identify and get involved with each but 1/3 through the book I was struggling too much to make heads or tails of anything."
1,"pathetic mess, don't open this pandora's box","Probably the worse book I've ever read. It's a wonder this book was ever published. I had to force myself to finish reading it, hoping there was some clarity or purpose to the story. There wasn't."
1,"Questionalble history, Mysticism, and Incest","If you like questionable historical fiction barely based in reality, incest, and mysticism all wrapped together in a long tedious narrative ending with a cliche then this is the book for you."
1,Don't listen to the tape!,"In the abridged tape version, this was a silly story. Silly stories are fine, but the ending to this one was too irritating and any redeeming value was obviously edited out. It started out okay, but got sillier and sillier and the ending was super silly. I doubt if I ever read anything else by this author."
1,Overly contrived and relationships bordering on absurd.,"This book was a great disappointment. In an efforts to weave history and the occult the author takes such great liberties with established fact and stretches the occult aspects beyond credulity. Attempting to join Solomon, Jesus, Roman Emperors Tiberius through Nero, and Hitler, in the creation and search for mystical objects of power makes for a disjointed and unbelievable ""plot"". The author's efforts at being complex in the personal family relationships of the main characters went beyond interesting or challenging to a pointless exercise."
1,Most people will not enjoy this book,"The premise and overall theme of the book is facinating and should attract you, but the execution--the way this is brought about in the book--is so poor, I can't think of many redeeming qualities in the book. The plot convolutions are unnecessarily complicated and at the end, the reader is left with a frustrated feeling. Carrying about 2 different timelines isn't the problem--I've read other books, and even the author's previous books manage to do this quite well, but I get the feeling Neville really didn't work this one through enough and the publisher was very negligent in not pointing this out to her."
1,A circle never ends,"I very much enjoyed this author's first novel, The Eight. With anticipation I picked up a copy of this one and found: the plot is almost non-existent, and long diatribes of Aryan-related metaphysical mumbo-jumbo stand in for it. The main character is by turns hideously stupid and smugly smart; the 'big surprise' is in fact neither very big nor terribly surprising. The title seems to herald a basic fact about the plot and about the way the story is told: one continues to run around in circles around the focal 'mystery', and never penetrates it.I'd strongly recommend her first novel instead. This one? Check it out from the library some day when you're completely without reading material. Buy it used.But don't spend your money on it."
3,"Entertaining read, weak ending.","I had read Neville's _The Eight_ and found it interesting. _The Magic Circle_ is interesting, too, but I was quite disappointed in the ending. Neville does a good job of springing surprise after surprise on the main character; really makes you stay on your toes keeping up with the twists and turns. But after all that hard work, there's no real conclusive ending. My reaction was, ""Is that all we're gonna get? Harumph."""
4,"Brilliant, but almost too complicated to read","The Magic Circle is absolutely brilliant in its connections between history, mythology, multi-cultural religion and the exciting plot. Full appreciation of this book requires knowledge more diverse than most of us can claim (myself included), and the many story lines are almost impossible to follow. The Magic Circle is like a beautifully written sentence that has just so many words that you don't know what it said when you get to the end. But don't give up on Katherine Neville! Go back to The Eight. It's the best book I ever read!"
1,Dissapointing....,I thought that I will love this book as I loved the Eight but I was in a mistake. This book is so difficult and to boring in some parts that I tried to re read many pages of some chapters to make sense to me the story.I don't reccomend this book.
5,Looking forward to her future works with great anticipation,"I have read many books written by many authors throughout my life. Some old. Some new. The topics introduced in this book echo some of the subjects I have read before. It was by chance alone that I discovered this title.Some say the heart is the seat of the soul. That it contains within it's chambers both the doorway to light and to darkness. I have always believed the voice of reason and knowledge proclaimed from the pulpits of religion, politics, science, and philosophy have been doled out piecemeal to humanity at best and while ""The Magic Circle"" is classified as fiction, in a literary sense, it struck a chord of symmetry deep within me. I will look forward to her future works with great anticipation."
4,GREAT!,I absolutely love reading Neville's books. I learn a lot and think she is an inspiring writer.
2,Writer's mind goes on tangents,"Ms. Neville probably had the right idea about the topic of this book. Her research is impressive and covers Greek, Roman, Celtic, Slavic, Aryan and Biblical myths and legends for the last 2000 years. However, the information about all these myths is not connected well and from the start to the finish of the book, I just couldn't see where is she going with it. In addition to that, the characters in this book are much more vague than the characters from her previous books. The family connections are confusing and I never could really grasp who is related to whom and why? I am hoping in her next book, Ms. Neville will use less research, more imagination, less superficial character forms, and more of her writing talents. After all, the author of ""The Eighth"" can do better than ""The Magic Circle""."
2,Don't bother,"Listen to all the other people that said this was a not worth your time. The Eight was a wonderful book. This one though was interesting only at times and more often tedious and confusing. If you can't find anything better to read between your favorite author's new releases, pick this up. Otherwise find something else to spend your time reading."
5,ABSOLUTELY ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS YOU COULD READ,"This book was bought by my sister, who immediately bought copies for all seven women in our family. It is a wonderful story, not escapist at all. When you put this down, you will want to pick up the next Katherine Neville book immediately, because no one else is writing stories like this today. I have always been interested in the role women play in history, and this book well tell you things you will love to hear. It is about time someone figured these things out and had the courage to share them with the world. The heroine is one of my favorite characters. I just wish I could meet her in person. I am going to buy seven copies of the book and give them away, that's how much I love the Magic Circle."
4,Reading for pleasure,"For me, reading is for pleasure and I had a very enjoyable seven hours reading this book. While it was not up to the standard of ""The Eight"" (a book I found to be an exceptional read), I enjoyed every minute of this book. Having a fairly good knowledge of ancient history I was interested to see how Katherine Neville linked the past with the present day (late 80s). I will certainly be on the look out for her next book. If you read these reviews, Miss Neville - thank you!"
3,Oh My Prophet Moroni!,"As an avid reader, I was overjoyed to find a book I couldn't skim through in three hours and then forget. Finally! A book that made me stop, think, and have to engage my brain. I'm still not sure I've got all the geneology clear, but no matter. This first exposure to Ms. Neville's work has left an indelible impression and I look forward to discovering the rest of her characters.Personally, as a ""Maxfield"" (and a Mormon) I was delighted to find a name sake. But, oh my prophet Moroni, am I glad I didn't read some of these reviews before I picked up the book!"
2,Disappointing.,"It could have been great. What happened Katherine? It is sad that the highlight of the novel was Jersey's fall into the grave. ""I was startled by those damned guns going off in my ear."" Would that everyone else had done likewise."
1,The Magic Circle,"This book was a mess. At first I thought that it was going to be interesting and suspensful, but I was wrong. The main plot line of the story is good, but the background and historical chapters are confusing and totally distracting. I love books of this nature and this was a total disappointment."
1,TOO MUCH!!!,"I have read ""The Eight"" and I was expecting a thriller or a book that I wouldn't be able to put down. This book was very hard to read. Too many characters, I couldn't keep straight who was who!Too much narrative of historical facts mixed with myths, legends, conjecture, preaching...HELP... I was LOST! I kept thinking the story would get better and was thouroughly disappointed! Not worth your time to read. Like other reviews this story was hard to swallow. And her love affair with the handsome Wolfgang was TOOOO Much! A good word for this book: CHAOS! If you want to read it, I'll gladly give you my book!"
1,A confusing mess,"Poor history. Poor science. Poor theology. The plot is ridiculous, the characters cardboard, the dialog hackneyed. I'm glad I got this one at the library instead of wasting money on it."
2,What a God-awful mess!,"I loved ""The Eight.""I didn't finish this book.I simply cannot believe the same person wrote both books. One is great. One is a huge mess!Don't waste your time....forget ""The Magic Circle."" Re-read ""The Eight"" and enjoy storytelling at its zenith!"
1,Drowning in a sea of words,"I could not finish this book. I found myself bogged down by complex family trees, overly long descriptive passages, and too often pure boredom. At times I found myself considering note cards to keep the characters and their relationships straight. This is the first novel (by this author) that I have read, it may be the last."
2,"Not up to the standards set by ""The Eight""","""The Eight"" was one of the very best books I had ever read-I recommended it to more people who also loved it. So when I got ""The Magic Circle"" I was so excited--for about five minutes! This book was a complete waste of time--and I did finish it, though it was a job not a joy. The past was too detailed and confusing, the historical characters did not keep my interest like the ones in ""The Eight""-I kept skimming over these areas to get back to the present. This side of the story was better."
4,Neville's books surpass DaVinci Code,"Katherine Neville is a truly gifted writer. Her books are well researched, paced to keep you turning the pages, and are definitely more ""literate"" than the offerings of most authors in this genre. If you thought the DaVinci Code was good, you'll think Magic Circle is great. After you read this one...try her book ""The Eight"". It's amazing!"
1,"A Contorted, Unbelievable Tale","What a waste of time reading this mish-mash of historical and pseudo-historical facts was for me. I began reading it with great anticipation, but my hopes were soon dashed in the complicated morass of the plot. It was nearly impossible for me to keep track of all the characters and all the unbelievable turns of events. I'm glad that I bought my copy at a library book sale for 30 cents. I liked Ms Neville's previous book, The Eight, much better."
3,"If you liked ""The Eight"" don't get too excited","After reading Neville's book ""The Eight"" I was excited to get her other books. However, after reading ""The Magic Circle"", I was disapointed. The book lacks cohesiveness. She tries to hard to make the book have the plot twists and revelations that made ""The Eight"" so interesting. This causes the story to lose momentum at critical times. Other reviews recommend that you make a list of characters so you won't be lost. Well, you can do that if you want, but for this book it seems a bit too much trouble for the ""reward"" of the story. If I am going to work that hard, I want to read ""Shogun"" or ""Aztec"". If you are a die hard Neville fan, I suppose you will read it anyway- just don't get your hopes up."
2,Disappointing!,"Anticipating another book of the quality of ""The Eight"", I was giddy with delight upon finding ""The Magic Circle"". The synopsis got me even more excited - then I started reading...It just went on forever with yet another member of the heroine's improbably family changing characterizations -first they're a bad guy - no, now a good guy - no, you were right the first time. Also, the historical references were ridiculous and never tied in satisfactorily with what was happening in the present day. This makes me very sad because I know this author can do so much better!"
2,This book is terrible!,"I hated this book as much as I loved ""The Eight."" I felt that the author was more interested in showing off her vast knowledge and extensive research than in telling a good story. The ""tales"" in her book did little to advance the story line, and there wasn't much to the story line to begin with. The relationships between the family members was confusing and difficult to keep straight. If you haven't read ""The Eight,"" find a copy of that and skip this one altogether. I wish I had."
3,Interesting,"I must say, I enjoyed her previous 2 books more. I liked the parts about Ariel ""the girl-nuke"" and her weird family. I could have done without all the religious stuff, which was a bit too detailed for me. I hurried through these parts to get back to Ariel and her adventure."
1,Very disappointing,"Some time ago I read The Eight from this writer and really liked it. The argument was very attractive, with that mix of intrigue and historical facts and places. It was a book with a story so compelling that I could hardly stop reading until finished. So, when I got to know about this title The Magic Circle I bought it inmediatly and was really eager to read it. And it was a big disappointment. The text is so confusing with all those family relationships who no one can believe are true and the historical facts are so innumerable and thrown to the reader with almost no care, order or reason to be there that I could barely finish reading it. The ending is very bad constructed also, giving no reward to the reader who makes de effort to pass the many pages this book has. Really annoying and complex to the absurd, hardly believable story."
4,Great Book,"I really liked the book, as in the eight, the story gets weak or too fantastic in some spots, but the author keeps it interesting, adding historical facts to the plot which keeps you glued to the end, by the way, I thought it was too much of a build up in the story to have such a bland ending."
2,Be prepared to RE-READ many pages to understand the book...,"Never have I read a book that must be read twice before I even finish the book. I tried to keep all the details straight by completely understanding all the side stories, but in the end... it didn't matter since she did not close the ""Magic Circle"" properly. I logged onto Amazon.com to see if anybody else was as disappointed and frustrated as me.Ms. Neville is very creative and inspirational in some areas, but outlandish in other ways such as Ariel's family lineage - how much incest can a family have and keep the secrets so well kept?The Eight is one of my favorite books, so I look forward to a better book in the future from Ms. Neville. Next time, I think I'll check the reviews first."
3,A story about unveil ancient secrets,"Ariel, is a sweet nice girl, that had lived away from her family dark past, that includes incest, fascists and traitors. As soon as she receives his cousin legacy, her life is turn upside down, even her life is in danger. I like the fast pace of events in this novel, although the bloat of history facts and places can be overwhelming.You will need a pen and paper to keep track of the dysfunctional Behn family tree and relationships among half-brothers, uncles, aunts, etc.In summary, I think is an interesting reading, I particularly dislike the uncovered secrets in Pandora's documents that are just unveil till the end. There are so many theories that came out of them and nothing concrete that is disappointing."
5,"POWERFUL, FASCINATING, CAPTIVATING!",This book dazzles the mind. It has been a very long time since I have read a book with this much content and thoughtfulness applied by the author. I have to agree with the avalanche of intelligent reviews lauding Neville's style and complexity. Hard to put down!
4,Fascinating Time Travel,The Magic Circle is a trip through time and space that leaves you feeling almost giddy. I read the book when it first came out in hardback and I am now reading it for the third time and still learning more from it every day. I've recommended it to all my friends and they feel the same. Neville is the only one doing books like this. I hope she keeps it up!
5,Terrific Read!,I'm a fan of all of Katherine Neville's books. She doesn't let you down. This one grabs you from the start and doesn't let go until the end. The setting and plot twists are magical.
5,Cinema for French Conversation 2nd edition,Excellent book to use for a French Cinema class. Films are well analyzed.It can also be used in French classes to develop conversation and composition skills or to teach French culture
1,not much of a machete,But ok as a cheap sword if you plan on making a better sheath to carry it in. Probably ok if you do not put it to much rough use.
2,eh,This thing was really cheap so I shouldn't have expected much but that is exactly what I got. Oh well.
3,Novelty,"The quality of the metal, average, however, it was rather inexpensive, so I guess I shouldn't expect a lot. But it's cool as a novelty item."
4,United Sword Review,I bought this because it was cheap so I could use it for whatever and not worry about messing it up.The only thing I am not happy with is that the amazon photo description of this item is false.It is not a stainless/satin finish.It is all black coated.I wanted the satin finish but for the money you can't gripe too much!
2,experience,"Bought this sword as my first sword, it came a day early, but the package was squished a little and when I opened it up the handle of the sword was bent at a 90 angle I bent it back but now it feels very weak like it will snap if I hit it against something, came fairly sharp but once I put it through a Smith's 2 step sharpener it was razor sharp, also the sheath was not a kydex sheath it's a very flimsy nylon sheath that rips and tears easily, I read the reviews for this and other people got a hard sheath, if you want the same sword with the hard sheath I suggest getting the Timber Wolf ninja sword from BudK. Overall im disappointed in this sword I was expecting better but for $20 I cant be helped."
3,"It's a cheap knockoff, but it does a good job at it.","This item is an inferior, cheaper version of Ontario's Black Wind swords. That being said, this isn't a bad item. Its makers certainly knew they were using inferior materials, and made the best thing they could anyway. The steel, while not very good, is thick and well designed for maximum durability. The scabbard is pretty useless for wear on the back, it's only good for its belt loop. It's also right handed only, which I find very stupid. It took a whole star off its rating. I threw the scabbard away entirely. Even if you're right handed, it's nothing special, and mine cracked at the edges the first time I drew the blade. Good sword for the price, very bad scabbard. If that's okay, get one."
2,knock-off,OK! this is a knock-off Ronin Ninja Sword with just a shoulder harness nylon sheath( NOT ) a United Cutlery Ninja Sword with a Knock-Off KyDex harness. But it still works an wasn't a bad price
2,Good photography but ...,"This book was beautifully photographed, but only one item per page. I was looking for more items, especially items that didn't originally cost a fortune."
4,Pleased,"I gave this book to my Mother as a gift and, when I visit her, I always look for the book to review. For those who appreciate design and todays foremost product designers it is a great book. It makes one want to seek out these collectibles (especially if you can afford some of them!). I gave it 4 stars because I wish the book had more entries in it.I, like you, read the reviews before I buy. Go ahead, it's a fun book you'll be glad you have on hand to refer back to."
3,Paper quality used to be a lot better,"We have been buying these Alex Paper 100-foot rolls for 3 years, probably have gone thru 20 rolls by now. My son loves to draw trains and extra longgg trucks on 6-foot lengths that we cut. My complaint is that until some time in late 2011, the paper had always been good high quality. Since then, the two orders we received are much inferior in paper quality, it is not as smooth, not as even in opacity, and tears easily. I want the old stuff back!"
5,GREAT BUY,"Kids love it for painting,drawling with pens,markers,you can have endless fun making arts and crafts with your children. we love it:)"
2,Computer paper on a roll,Everything I read said this was heavy construction type paper. It isn't. It's the same weight as computer paper. Its just dispensed on a roll. I'm disappointed.
4,Reminder to read measurements,"Paper is good quality, shipped as stated no issues there. I just had a user error, I didn't read the measurements I just figured it was the same paper my daughter's play table had and it was MUCH smaller - oops! SO just a friendly reminder to check the measurements before ordering."
1,Not sturdy at all,I ordered this paper for my grandson to use for finger painting. The write-up says it is heavy construction paper. It is not. It is very flimsy paper and I returned it.
1,Wrong size recommendation by Amazon!,"I purchased this roll to go along with the Alex Super Art Table I also bought on Amazon. Beware - This size roll (12"") is too short for the table! I bought it since Amazon recommended that this product go along with the table I was purchasing. I figured, what the heck, it's only $10 I'll add an extra paper roll to my order. But...my table takes the 18"" wide paper...which I found out Christmas Eve when I put the table together. This paper would look lost on the big table. Luckily the table does come with a starter roll of paper which is the correct 18"" width. Stay away from this roll of paper if you are buying the Alex Super Art Table!! Or you'll end up wasting your money!"
2,Not up to date,"This book has an excellent style for explaining you all the things related to fault management with UNIX plattforms and dealing with databases. There's a LOT of information about SNMP and MIB's. But it's approach to fault management is primarly on tools, and the tools described are out of date or even some of those companies no longer exists (like platinum, bought by CA); the scripts provided are somehow simple; the database fault management techniques described are very, very generic and basic. Perhaps it can give you a basic idea and starting point to to this."
5,This is how male vocal groups should sing,"98 Degrees is above the rest of the male pop vocal groups. They don't deserve the boyband label oftentimes attached to them because they are more than just pretty faces--they are real musicians who formed their group out of real love for their music. I bought the two cds seperately, but even then each is excellent in its own way. When I bought 98 Degrees and Rising, I only knew two of the songs there, but even then I liked each and every song. The vocals, especially their harmonies, are very good. I especially liked their a capella rendition of She's Out of My Life--simply amazing! The Christmas album is also very good. All of the traditional songs were great and were sung in a decidedly non-pop, heartfelt style, which reflects the meaning of the songs better. This is one Christmas album that you'll listen to even outside the Christmas season. Now that the two cds are available together, I'm sure it is an opportunity real music fans would not like to miss."
4,Into the Woods Full Score,"This is such beautiful music that Sondheim has written. I just wish that all of the spoken text, and music could all be together somewhere. It's so difficult, and somewhat frustrating trying to go back and forth between the book of dialogue, and then back to the music. I'm a musician that needs to see the music going on underneath me, and don't like to learn my music by just listening to a recording of it. Maybe some day the two will be printed together."
3,Yay!,"Finally released! This has every song on the OBC Recording and it sounds wonderful! It is extremely difficult to play though, as most Sondheim music is."
5,Great reference material,"The vocal score for ""Into the Woods,"" while not practical for use at the piano due to the nature of the binding, is a terrific study aid for those interested in analyzing Sondheim's brilliant work. I recommend it to anyone wishing to enhance his or her understanding and appreciation of the piece."
5,Drake is the greatest pirate of all times!,I love the story of Sir Francis Drake and his adventures in the Spanish Main and was eager at this chance at such a thourouh telling of his story.
1,Can't set it up,Spent about an hour on step 1.Simply place the handle into the two holes on either arm. Simple enough. Or not.Right side got stuck about half way. Spent 10 minutes trying to get it out. Finally did. Lets try again.. gets stuck at same spot. Put some wb40 on it try to get it back out.. 15 minutes later it comes out after pulling it like i was trying to hold onto someone hovering over a fire pit. Put a ton of wb40 on it.. lets just do this simple step on more time.. surely it will work.Nope. Stuck again. I then promptly cursed for about 30 minutes staring at it and now I'm going to see how I can return it or just talk Pheonix's ear off until they somehow help me.Don't buy this product. Or hope they send you one that you can put together without losing your mind.Thank you very little.
1,THIS IS BUILT FOR A TODDLER!!,"I was so excited about this item! Once receiving it, I was like ok?? there is no room to run! or even walk!! it's so little! your not getting a good work out this is built for a toddler that what it seemed! VERY DISAPPOINTED!"
1,could be better,"in concept this is a very good product, but it falls a bit short. 1. I would like to be able to lower or adjust the incline. 2. it would be nice if the tread moved more freely. The price is good"
4,"Great, but a bit loud.","The unit folds up nicely. Easy to use, easy to set up and take down. The only drawback is that it makes a louder sound than I would like."
1,Phoenix 98510 Treadmill,Did not like this product at all. Hard to use and cheaply made. Junked it after 3 days struggling to make it work. Bought a better one.
3,Product arrived defected.,"The shipping was very quick! Unfortunately, the product came damaged. The screen on the adapter thing that tells you how fast your running and burning calories and stuff came scratched up a lot. It also does not work. The wires must be defected or something. It say's 0000 no matter what. The machine thing works just fine, which is why I gave it 3 stars. The shipping was quick and the machine does what it's suppose to, but it came partly defected which was a bummer for me."
3,I love treadmills but...,"I took a chance on this one, but it didn't work out. I wanted to love it, because of the price, but it is just too hard to use. As a lover of motorized treadmills, I thought this could work, but nope. There is no way to use it without holding on to the handles. Forget a nice stroll -- you will be out of breath."
3,Little disappointed,"I was really happy to order this manual treadmill, especially for this price. The product was easy (but a little heavy for a 63yr old woman) to assemble and easy to fold up. All the tools needed to put it together were included which is a real plus! I haven't been using it because the belt has a tendency to pull to the right and rubs against the flywheel. I've adjusted it as instructed in the manual, but can only walk for about a minute until it slides again and rubs against the flywheel. The manual says it may have shifted during shipping, but it's really fustrating to have to step off and pull the belt away from the flywheel. I kept the box and return shipping label, but will try to adjust it AGAIN before that. Probably find an electric one that won't need such an extreme adjustment."
4,Happpy Customer,I reveiced this unit in great condition. It was really eaasy to assemble. It went from box to use in about 15 minutes. Instructions were easy to read. Unit works smooth and easy. I'm 200 lbs and I can get a pretty quick jog on it without worry of it breaking. My only complaint is that it doesnt have an adjustable incline feature but other that that it's great!
1,Phoenix 98510 Manual Treadmill,This product did not meet any of my expectations. It was awkward to stand on and the belt kept sticking when I put my full weight (136) on it. I had to literally hold myself up on the handles to keep the belt going. I returned it a week after I purchased it.
3,ok,this is a good sturdy product.. just wasn't what i wanted u do have to hold the handles to walk fast on it or to walk at all.
3,It is a workout,The unit was easy to set up. The exercise routine is much more strenuous than walking on a motorized Treadmill. I was able to walk at a good pace on a motorized unit for an hour but I am working slowly up to a half hour on the this unit. I do feel once I get my stamina up that the workout will be a substantial one and get me ready for hiking in the Springtime. I did have to lessen the incline in order to get into a smooth pace. I will slowly increase the incline as I get stronger.
5,Simple and efficient,"I checked the ones that were motorized, they were too expensive, we live in an apartment and this unit fits great, easy to fold and little maintenance, walk at your own pace. great product"
1,Denise Austin Easy up Manual Treadmill,"Extremely unstable. Hard to walk on the belt. Additionally, I get static shocks from holding on to the metal bars on the sides therefore I need to grip the rubber part on top but that makes walking even more unstable. It is not a ""smooth quiet operation"" as the ad states. I will return the item. I wish I had not thrown away the box. I know I will never use it now. It is a waste of time and money."
1,Worst product ever. Too many positive Amazon reviews,"Unsafe product. Yes, its manual, but it's not smooth. You're too busy hanging on for dear life rather than enjoying your treadmill experience. The frame is too small and rickety for such use (the hanging on for dear life part).If it was smoother, the work out WOULD be worth it since its naturally on an incline and it makes you work it. But, its not worth risking your safety over. Just buy a power driven model so you don't have to wonder if you're going to trip and break a leg.Its so dangerous that I refused to give it away. I just disassembled it and tossed it out on separate trash days to avoid someone from adopting it for themselves."
1,Can't believe Denise Austin lent her name this,"Walking outside sets my allergies off, so I wanted to walk inside. I wrongly thought a manual treadmill would be beneficial. HA! It's nearly impossible to get a walking rhythm on this. It's like stuttering with my feet. I could easily walk 5 miles in high heels around my neighborhood, but this thing wears me out in 5 minutes. Within the first week of using it, I developed a pain in my left leg that may or may not be related to the treadmill (I have RA). But when this pain is present, it's all that more difficult to get the treadmill moving at a worthwhile pace. I am really sorry I bought this. I should have tested some store models out first.The info also leads one to believe that this ""collapsible"" treadmill can actually be stored somewhere. Even collapsed, it's still too big to put under most beds."
2,Not to happy,"I can not leave the treadmill folded up because it falls all the time. I made a mistake when reading the details i did not realize the treadmill was self powder, however it does work great. I just wish it would stay folded up with out falling."
5,Outstanding Product,"I am person that the package is always missing some parts, the directions are not clear, and I can never get the darn thing assembled in a reasonable amount of time, not so with this product and assembly was a snap! Great product and needed no belt adjustments right out of the box. The slight elevation gives a good workout for someone my age of 66 years old. I am more than completely satisfied with this product. I don't recommend this product for running but for slow to medium to a brisk walk this is excellent. Good job Amazon for offering this treadmill."
4,good for winter,"I received this item in a timely manner and assembled it quickly. The machine is satisfactory but the no motor treadmill takes some getting used to. Initially, my gait was erratic but with experience, it's smoother."
2,I'm not blown away,"We've had this treadmill for a couple of months and it still hasn't really made a great addition to our exercise routine, here's a few reasons why:- The belt sticks enough that I've noticed my knees and hips hurt after using it for a few hours at a time.- It's a lot more noisy than I expected, loud enough that it annoys my wife if used in the same room she's watching TV in.- Folding this thing up is way more trouble than it should be. This means that to stop my 15 month old daughter from playing on it we need to be put it in the closet or pile things on top of it... Not a great way to encourage yourself to get active.- The grip bar on this thing seems far too short for someone my height (about 6')."
4,What a deal and great for winter being stuck inside,"Treadmill was easy to setup with all parts included.My only issue is that the belt once ""walked"" a bit to the right from stepping too hard on the right side of the belt, but just by stepping hard on the left side I was able to walk it back to the center within a few steps. Plus it would be nicer to have the handle bars higher up for taller people.As far as the work out, it's really nice for being stuck inside during the winter as I usually walk a lot around my neighborhood otherwise. Takes a few minutes to get use to pushing the belt manually, and as others have said, do get the oil and put it on right away as it's smoother. It seems like it will last for some time. No regrets buying this over some huge, expensive, electric treadmill and it's easy to move around or even put away. VERY pleased for the $$$."
2,This is for tiny people.,"This is for really small people. I am not overweight, but if I was, I would not be able to use this treadmill at all. To be honest, I am still trying to figure out if it will really work for me.... The tread-y part is narrow and short, so it feels a bit awkward. I am 5'11, and I can't imagine someone any taller using this thing either. Iffy guys, iffy."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"I purchased this manual treadmill because my motorized treadmill made too much noise and would wake up my two boys.You need to be the most coordinated person in the world to walk on this thing without falling off. My husband even made and attached some ""risers"" to put on the back thinking it would make it easier to walk on. That didn't work either. It is a workout to try to stay on this treadmill without sliding off and cursing too loudly. What a waste of money and space."
5,great,"easy setup took 30 min. incline is ok, it is a perfect walker, came in a timely manner, quite works great at a fantastic price"
4,Excellent treadmill for basic walking needs,"The Phoenix Denise Austin 98510 Easy-Up Manual Treadmill is a great product for the price for basic walking needs. Jogging/running is possible but you definitely need to hold on to the rails. I average 3.0 mph walking, and it is quiet flawless in its operation. It was also very easy to put together. Also, be sure to read the entire manual, especially the part about the belt adjustment.For some, finding the right balance may take some getting used to because of the incline, but overall it suited our needs very well."
1,Be Careful of reviews,"Beware of reviews! This is not a great machine. The saying is true ""you get what you pay for"". I wish I had opened the box and tried it before my 30 days because I would have returned it. Although sturdy, the treadmill sticks and the work out becomes very unstable and it works you harder than you anticipate. I would not recommend this. I used the Pyroil Silicone Lubricant Spray as they recommend but it does not work well at all."
5,"Met expectation, easy assembly","Instructions were clear, and assembly was easy. Included ""tool"" was adequate enough for job.We were looking for a simple, ""no frills"" machine, and this is it!Takes up little space, stores easily.Even our daughter uses it, the cat not so much."
3,Good coverage...,There are a couple of hundred books on Whisky on the bookshelves nowadays but most of them delve too deeply or too lightly into the subject. This book tries to take the middle road by opening with a general process and background and then coverin each region one by one. But in the end this companion falls into the 'Light' category.Even then it is a great buy for the price as it covers most of the Whisky's you would ever lay your eyes on and covers then in a succinct one page each...
4,Good read... ended WAY too soon...,"I really enjoyed this book. It was well organized and well written. A fun and easy read of a very interesting case. It looses a star, though, because there is no conclusion to the story. They printed before the verdict came down, so now I have to search on the internet to find out what happened. This does not please me!"
2,"OK book, misleading title.","John Robinson was a businessman, Eagle Scout and Man of the Year. Very few people knew the real John Robinson. Three quarters of the book deals with the prior crimes committed by John. He was always setting up new businesses and trying to get people to invest. Each time the police caught him, he would start up another business.While only a quarter of the book dealt with his new found internet lifestyle. The book was well written except for the ending, when the reader is left wonder what actually happened."
5,Excellent book,"This is a must read book for all of the people who interact on the net with ""FRIENDS""."
2,I Couldn't Finish It,"I couldn't finish this book. I got tired of reading about the Inspector's wife, her love of violent sex, and her affairs. Her husband is aware of the affairs, and they annoy him, but when confronted with the odor of her lover's cigar smoke in her hair, all he does is think ""the least she could do is wash her hair"". What the heck? Do something, man!Meanwhile, the brilliant female cop gets very little book time, and most of the time when she is there, she's making coffee.Other than that is the fact that the mystery is pretty obvious. The author basically tells you whudunnit.It's a shame, because I enjoy the author's writing style, but I just was disgusted with this book."
4,Essential for Joseph Warren Enthusiasts,"John Cary's scholarly biography is thorough and well documented. Rather than a continuous narrative, it is thematic based on the spheres in which Revolutionary Era hero Warren operated. This reflects gaps in the source material. Sibley's Lives of Harvard Graduates, a circa 1968 agglomeration of official biographies of 18th century Harvard gradates, opines that Cary was inclined to give full credit to Joseph Warren for a number of political writings and actions that were actually Sons of Liberty team efforts. Cary's biography touches on Warren's personal and love lives very little, again reflecting an absence of primary sources."
4,Joey Barron..,"is the reason why I picked up this release in the first place. I had heard of Steve Khun, but was unfamiliar with his music. Having seen joey play live several times with John Zorn, I was interested to hear him in this context. This is beautiful music. Corny as that sounds it is really the only way to put it. I have since moved on to other Khun records and learned a little about him...impressive career so far! It is nice to hear a pianist who is on the ECM label and does not ape Keith Jarrett, Steve has his own touch and the trio on this disc is empathetic and supportive throughout. Of course the disc is recorded wonderfully and you feel like your are three feet away from the music. Buy it."
4,i just started to read it;,i like the way he writes and it was everything i thought it was going to be about las vegas
3,Just Ok,If you are really into organized crime then maybe this would be a little more interesting. I struggled to finish this book without falling asleep.
5,Love this book!,"This book gives you the REAL names of the people involved in the Vegas gaming scene in the 70's and early 80's. If you liked the movie Casino, you'll love this book!"
2,"Good book, not so great condition","I love the book, and know it is an older version. But the book was in very poor condition, with some kind of stuff all over every page. I guess I couldn't expect much more from a rare book."
4,Olsen Reviewer is incorrect,"This book IS NOT fiction. It is the true story that the movie Casino was based on.In the book, the names have not been changed and there are a few more details than in the movie.If you like the movie, I suggest reading the book to get the whole picture of what went down."
3,Not what you may expect - a partly hamstrung story.,"Readers coming to this book from 'Wiseguy' will become aware of a major flaw in this account of organised crime's workings in Las Vegas from the 1960s through to the 1980s. Henry Hill was free to more or less spill the beans unguardedly and his candour and thrilling free-flowing narrative is exactly what key participants in this story still alive cannot give us (despite what the book's gushing blurb promises).This gives a patchy quality to much of the narrative and by the end the reader is left mulling as many unanswered questions as those the book attempts to amswer. There are fascinating aspects to the book (given the characters involved there could hardly not be) but ultimately the book fails to satisfy. A definitive volume on the history of Las Vegas and organised crime will surely come one day, but at the moment too many lips are zipped."
4,Pileggi Sans Scorsese,"My rating on this book is really a three and a half, if given the option to rate a half-star, that is.I enjoyed tremandously learning about the Teamsters, the politicians and of course the Mafia involvement in the Las Vegas casino operations. The book exceled in the abundance of information.However, the writing itself was not so great therefore lowering the reading experience. Just as in real life, when people tell you their side of the story, it hardly ever concurs with someone else's account. Since the book was really a collage of vaious narrations, the author had a hard time weaving together different points of views and tones. Sometimes readers are left wondering what really happened.I would recommend this book for people who are interested in information and stories regarding the Mafia. The topic is very interesting, but for those who prefers a bit more drama and fluency of writing, then this may not be your top choice."
5,Book differs from the movie,This book (like usual) is different from the movie Casino. This book is worth reading since this adds some more realism than the movie did. Another great mafia book by Pileggi and worth the price you paid for it. Great if you like the Italian mafia and Las Vegas.
2,Casino,"I was really excited about reading this book. I was living in Vegas and working at a Caesars, so to read about the history and lore of the city was intriguing to me. Yet, this book was hard to finish, I had to force myself to read it. It did not captivate me and I did not care what became of the characters. It was less than enjoyable and I was greatly disappointed. I find the real life experience of living and working in Sin City to be much more fascinating than reading about it."
1,Grossly overated,"I am appalled at the glowing reviews that I've read for this book. It is, quite simply, terrible. The pace of this book is hyper-kinetic. It's not possible to feel anything for any characters because you never get to know them. First person is fine if the person remains the same. In this book, it is almost impossible to tell who is speaking because it changes virtually every page. The reviews found on this web site seem to have as much validity as the blurbs written on any bestseller. If you want to read a mob book, read The Godfather. If you have already read it, read it again."
1,Not What Expected!,"Very disappointed as the book is more like a movie script (i.e. ""He enters the room, voice over"") This makes it very dull and I couldn't get into the book altho I tried several times."
2,Average,"Not a great mafia book - I found myself bored at some points.It really was a little boring at times. For a great mafia book, youcan not go wrong with the Godfather (the only decent Puzo book in my mind.)THe 1st person format I think was a weakpoint in this book"
3,Great idea but average execution,"My 5-year-old son loves this clock. He learned to tell time by reading digital clocks, but did not grasp analog time.Pro:1. It works like a real clock. You can only spin the minute hand to advance or reverse time. The hour hand can only move when you spin the minute hand. This is great for learning how time moves.2. Good size for small hands - about 6 inches in diameter.3. Has a removable stand in the back, and can be stored on the clock flat so you can store it in a drawer.Con:1. The hour hand somehow lost its adjustment, so for example when the minute hand was at 45, the hour hand would already be advanced to the next hour. This is confusing to a child who is learning how to tell time.2. The minute hand became loose.3. The removable stand is a little loose.Final thoughts: I would recommend this clock because it's a great learning toy, but there are a few little problems with it."
1,don't buy it,This clock does not function for teaching a child analog time. The hands do not move separately and you cannot get an accurate reading of hours and minutes.It only frustrated my grandaughter (and me).
3,VERY Small,"This clock is very small. If you see other pictures of an adult holding a large clock, that is NOT this clock. This clock is little. Worth $6 but not what I thought it would be."
1,Tiny and Ineffective,"It is really small, about the size of the palm of your hand. The hands do not turn independently, the only way to make the small red hand turn is by rotating the hour hand clockwise, you can't go counterclockwise either. The back has some weird plastic things sticking out that will poke your hand unless you put electrical tape over it. Certainly not worth the money."
3,Clock for telling time,"A little smaller than I had expected, but good for one on one.Good for counting minutes, which lead to an hour!As always thou , quick shipping !"
3,Not that big.,"The clock is not very big, but medium sized. It is sturdy and conveniently has a stand in the back."
2,SMALL - It's a 12 dollar plastic clock (excluding shipping),"A quarter (coin) sitting next to it for a scale for reference to size would have helped. Nothing burns my *ss more than getting a simple gift and finding out it is even more simple than I anticipated. I wanted a clock for my 2 year old to tinker with. This clock is not durable and it is not for a toddler.I would think twice before buying this unless you are in a controlled environment and/or using it with a very slow-moving child. This clock is ""dinky"" and tiny. Nothing more.Have fun."
4,Little clock,Cute clock. Much smaller than I anticipated. The back piece that holds it up is a little unstable. Pretty small - but does the job.
5,It Is What It Says,"I was looking for a simple clock to help teach time to my young daughter. It does exactly what it is intended to do (& the hands do move separately). I have also used this for other purposes, like a quick way to mark an early bed time or time out."
5,Pleased with product,The Learning Clocks arrived very quickly and they are just what I wanted. I am pleased with them. The price was right. Transactioon went smoothly. Thanks.
1,THIS IS NOT A WORKING CLOCK,"I ordered 2 of these; one for the family room and one for my 7 year old son's room to reinforce what he has learned about reading a clock (I work with 8th graders and most can't read a clock with hands, only a digital clock). Nowhere in the description does it say that the hands don't move unless you move them. That fact should be made clear. Only when you get this does it state on the back of the box in tiny letters ""not a working clock"". As a tool for very small children, this would be great. But it is a teaching toy, not a clock."
3,Smaller than I thought it would be,"My daughter wanted a clock for Christmas to play school with. This one is a lot smaller than I thought it was going to be, but it functions very well."
3,tips easily,"I like the fact that both hands are geared together so the child gets to see how the hour hand moves when the minute hand is moved - much slower that is. On the con side both hands are not well aligned so at 12 o'clock the hour hand is not exactly vertical. Instead it is at the position where it should be at 10 minutes after 12. I haven't figured out yet if/how this can be adjusted. Also, the clock tips very easily forward."
1,Cheesy,Base is too light; lamp can knock over easily. Shade is a dingy yellow color. Definitely not worth the price.
4,better,Mr. Garbarek just keeps getting better. It's jazzy without sounding dysfunctional. I love the floating melody over the rhythm section of the first piece. This is happy music full of life.
4,Music That Changed My Life!,"Well, well. Jan Garbarek is amazing no matter what he does, but here specifically the compositions and musicianship are stunning. The music is powerful in that it is effervescent in its quality, soulful and vibrant. It penetrates deep and affects you sonically. The production is, as usual with ECM, flawless and moving. Lay back and the melodies take you anywhere and everywhere."
1,Proves the theory...,"Great sidemen don't always make great composers. Jan Garbarek is a brilliant contemporary saxophonist. His body of work playing with the likes of Keith Jarrett, Charlie Haden, Ralph Towner, Art Lande and other ECM artists is simply stunning.But ""Visible World"" can only be described as a collection of banal Kenny G. new-age cliches. What happened? Perhaps Jan wanted to go after some of that big Kenny G. cash? Or maybe, absent the collaboration of other great musicians, Garbarek's creativity left him? Either way, this CD is beneath him, certainly not a reflection of his prodigious talent. Skip this, and instead savor some of his most amazing work on Keith Jarrett's ""Personal Mountains""."
2,Kenny G meets Deep Forest,"This is a rather lifeless, unimaginative work. It should be filed under ""easy-listening"" and not ""jazz."" Buy it if you want background music while taking a bath but not if you want to appreciate good musicianship. The global tinkering offers some muted colour, and it successfully creates a mellow atmosphere, but overall the music is too forgettable to want to hear it again. Garbarek is alleged to have talent, but I'll have to wait and hear ""Officium"" before I can judge for myself."
1,NO STARS,"This ... Interplak toothbrush is posibly the worst item I have ever purchased from Amazon, unfortunately I threw out the packaging before trying out the product the next morning, and now I cannot get my money back! I changed the batteries a number of times but the brush head moves too slowly to clean any teeth. My ... Crest Spinbrush is much better than this."
1,NO STARS! (You should have a slot for NO STARS),"This is possibly the worst product I have ever purchased...and at such a high price, no wonder it is no longer manufactured! My $5 Crest Spinbrush works 5 times better than this Interplak product, which cost me 5 times more! I threw out the packaging immediately b/c I had faith it would work and now I can't return it and get my money back! The brush and motor work extremely slow and do not clean properly...it is totally worthless...."
4,The elves are BACK!,"Okay, okay...yeah, I didn't like this as much as the first novel. Who could? The plot was every bit as good, don't get me wrong...but I sometimes hated the way that things were done. Yes, it's a great read. It's fast-paced, and if you don't get TOO annoyed with the dark elves, then it's pretty good. I just wish that they would get a new villian. In other words, YES, I AM ANNOYED BY THE DARK ELVES!!! Anybody wonder what ever happened to Mort?"
4,"Good book, but I have questions","This book has good info and it appeard that Dr. Klatz is married to the idea of ""Anti-aging"" and ""longevity"". I applaud his work here and in his prior book. Recently, he and Dr Bob Goldman were sanctioned though by the State of Illinois for listing themselves as ""MD's"", when in fact they are DO's (doctor of osteopathy). They did do the school work of a MD (in a non-US school) but not the rotations, etc. I hope that this was all cleared up as I would hate to see such a good writer and smart person get caught up in legal mishaps. I do recommend the book."
5,a treasure!,i love this book... it is so rhythmical and sensual. i got it for my husband on our wedding day. it was perfect.
2,Hard to Store,"We were delighted to receive this toy as a gift, but greatly dismayed after assembling it to discover that it does not fold and must remain permanently open, which is a huge storage problem. Probably it would be better to get an easel that is foldable, even if it is larger."
1,Poor Design,"We bought this easel for our three year old son. However, we were quite disappointed that the easel does not fold. It is quite big and it is difficult to store. If I had room to store an easel, then I would have just purchased a standing one! Also, the design is poor. The paper roll keeps falling down, which caused the easel to disconnect. I had to hold the easel together for our son to use it. Urgh. Needless to say, I am on Amazon now looking for a new easel. What a waste of money."
2,Nice but could be better...,"This easel I bought for my 2 year old daughter's birthday. It's cute & it does save space however the chalkboard side is pretty much worthless. No chalk that I have purchased so far actually writes on this ""chalkboard"". Most chalks that we've tried will make faint marks but it's not what I'd expected."
5,Making a joyful (and beautiful) noise to the Lord,"This album is perfect for anyone who loves the old hymns. It includes one song that younger people may have never heard before: Church in the Wildwood. I'm 32 and had never heard it. It's a wonderful song and one of my favorites now.Tennesse Ernie sings beautifully on this album. He has a deep, rich voice and a great choir backing him up. It sounds like these people are really worshipping God and having a good time as well.I'm listening to the album as I write this review. Which is actually making it a little difficult, because this is music you want to sing along with. I think this album will be a real blessing to everyone who hears it."
5,great listening,"This CD was all that I expected and hoped it would be. It has the wonderful acapella gospel songs that Ernie finished his shows with,great listening."
3,Old-Fashioned Hymns,"Hymns Through the CenturiesHe has a beautiful voice, it you like the old songs, you'll like this!"
2,not what i expected,"this has more of a real life, discovery channel feel to it. there is very little bob the builder and my one year old definitely preferes the regular shows. maybe he'll grow into it..."
5,My first and it's good,My first bike computer; I like how the design gives you a lot of info on one screen. There is rarely a need to hit the button. The piece that attaches to the spoke of your tire is made of metal with a metal screw so it doesn't slip or shoot off like other ones that I have read about. The only possible issue that I have seen is that the screen sometimes has a slightly dark appearance when I first start riding (and I'm not in direct sunlight at all). But it seems to clear up within a few minutes. Overall very good.
3,Love / Hate Relationship,"Wow! It's great to have 4 items on the same screen? Controls are real simple - one button! Well constructed - heavy sensor wire.But, no average speed - aargh. And, it falls asleep at rest stops, and sometimes resets itself when it wakes up. I'm not sure whether this is user error or a defect...."
5,good buy,This item was purchased as a gift. Intallation was easy and it has performed as expected ( no problems). It gives all the information needed and seems to be very accurate. I can't imagine a better bang for the buck.
1,Doesn't Work with Disc Brakes,"Unfortunately, this computer doesn't work on my bike, because I have disc brakes.Disc brakes require the fork to be farther from the spokes in order to accommodate the braking mechanism. The implication is that no matter where on the fork that you mount the sensor, the magnet will be too far away for the computer to work properly.I wish this limitation had been clearer before I made this purchase. If you have a bike with disc brakes, don't bother with this unit."
4,Nice Product,"It works just like it is supposed to. I've used it for about a year and haven't had any problem so far. Still using the original batteries too. There are bike computers that have more features, but for me this one works great and gives me the information for my commute that I need. I recommend it."
1,"---agree with 1 star ""Mocking Otter""","I have had the same experience as ""Mocking Otter"". It does take forever to toast bread, and then I have to flip it over to get the lighter side. No, I do not have it on the bagel setting, which only toasts one side. I have always had toasters for years, and have only had this one for one year and use almost daily. I am looking for another toaster ---- any suggestions would be greatly appreciate :)"
1,First time Cook's Illustrated let me down,"I bought this toaster to replace a toaster oven. As always before making a kitchen gadget purchase, I checked with Cook's Illustrated. They rated this the best relatively inexpensive toaster. I am so disappointed. A major complaint with making toast in the toaster oven is that it took so long, but this model takes even longer. A the maximum ""browness"" setting, the bread is typically still far from done, and inevitably requires a portion of another cycle. By the time the toast is browned, the bread is dried out. Good for making Melba Toast, I suppose."
2,Did everything except toast bread.,"This is a good looking machine and had recieved good reviews but even when I turned it all the way up to 5, it's highest setting, it barely gave white bread any color at all. It has all the settings you'd expect, and it was consistent, but for me, that was consistently poor. I sent it back and am still looking for a great toaster."
3,Made in China,"Cooks Illustrated did a review of toasters and this was the top pick. They also took apart a toaster (didn't say which one) and revealed inconsistent wrapping of the toaster coils. One side had coils for each of the notches of the panel, the other side had fewer coils than notches. They were wrapped slightly diagonally thus covering the space with fewer coils. So one side toasted well while the other did not. Made in China cheap slave labor results. With the variety of reviews it seems you may get lucky and get a good toaster, or not."
2,BEWARE of buying this item from Target on Amazon,"Great toaster, but careful if you are an Amazon Prime customer or use 1-click ordering. I ordered this with another item (not from Target) and specified ""Free 2-day shipping"". Imagine my shock at finding out from the shipping confirmation that I was being charged $26 to ship a $37 toaster to New York. Unbelievable but true. Waiting to hear whether Amazon is going to help."
2,"toasts, sort of","Relying on America's test kitchen, which I will not do again, I went to some effort to find this toaster. It does not toast whole wheat bread in one go, which is a nuisance. Then it also may not toast both sides the same; one may be fairly untoasted when it's done on the other side. It was not any better than the toaster I discarded in its favor."
5,For a time such as this!,"""The best way to control the opposition is to lead it."" - LeninWarning this book capitivates and is a great read. I respect Dr. Dennis Cuddy's approach to revealing the hidden hand of the establishment intertwined with biblical prophecy without being overbearing or what some liberals might call McCarthyism. No dis on Joe just refer to the Verona Papers. Cuddy documents very well and with little effort anyone can come to their own conclusions. I had an earlier addition and read it over a 6 day vacation to Mexico. Unfortunately I gave that copy and half a dozen more away and ended up getting this updated version recently. This one doesn't disappoint either.God Bless!"
1,The cable doesn't work as advestised,"I bought this cable in conjunction with the XGL-LW100, and Dolby Digital simply did not work. This was not the case of me not setting the option in Dashboard - Settings, the XBOX simply did not recognize this cable as implementing Dolby Digital. This is very disappointing, I have been a loyal Monster Cable customer for as long as I can remember, and their product simply didn't work here. Microsoft XBOX support knows of these problems, and the tell you to get the Microsoft kits, so buyer beware on these Monster Cable solutions, they don't work on all XBOX's.I returned both the XGL200 and the XGL-LW100 for the Microsoft Advanced AV kit and got Acoustic Research fiber cable and gold plated RCA video cable and I enjoy Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS from my XBOX now. One other thing to set straight is that the Microsoft Advanced AV kit includes the breakout box and basic cables to hook up S-Video and RCA audio, but not a fiber cable or RCA video cable."
2,Nitrogen gas-injected for clearest picture???????,"Okay, when i bought the stuff it said Nitrogen gas-injected dielectric insulator delivers maximum video signal strength for the clearest picture possible. 1) av jacks aren't the clearest, 2)i dont see a difference from my stock av cables and these monster cable ones. 3) The dolby digital works when you buy a cable, i mean what the heck, why would i wanna buy another cable, the fiber optic one plus this one plus tax is like $50. i just suggest you get the component cables, not theese av ones. the S-video ones are okay, but i wouldn't reccomend them. EVEN THOUGH monster cable has the best cables this one is a dissapointment."
4,It's good,"When i tried this product at a friend's house, i was actully kind of wondering why the Monster Cables were so good. This cable makes a difference. Well at least it made a difference in the games that we played. I personally will not be investing in one right as of now for my Xbox, but I plan on getting one as my game collection increases. I think for avid players who want to experience it all, you should give it a try. Trust me you will be happy you did."
1,Dont buy this product!,"I recently purchased the Gamelink 200X and the Lightwave 100X for my Xbox and I must say that I would like to know how can Monster claim that their hookup cables put out a dolby digital signal when the fiber optic cable (100X)plugs into an adapter which then plugs into the A/V cable (200X). This adapter has a headphone style connector which isnt capable of producing a 5.1 surround signal compared to a toslink connector. Therefore, an A/V receiver does not encode the signal as a dolby digital source, rather it interprets is as Analog/PCM or stereo sound. I must say that I have been extremely happy with all of my other Monster purchases. I have all my home theater components wired with Monster, but this product falls well below my expectation."
1,Basic - and degrading,"The first three chapters are okay: it's pretty basic information. The rest of the book? Crappy, and degrading to young adults. I (as well as most other young adults) don't like being talked down to.Webster throws tidbits of her own beliefs in there too, talking about sex, drugs, spirituality, etc., and she talks about herself and her family a lot. 1) Being preached to isn't fun 2) If you write a book about planning for someone's future, DON'T shove your own beliefs down the readers throats and use personal examples sparingly.Overall, the book is so basic, it's not worth buying. Or, you could give it to a kid in middle school or lower. High school and up - it's BASIC COMMON SENSE."
5,Son of Rambow - a gem,This is a delightful movie. I haven't encountered anyone of any age above 5 who hasn't thoroughly enjoyed it. Watch it and spread the word!
2,POINTLESS,"A really pointless movie. Poorly written, horribly structured, badly executed. No real hallmarks of entertainment--no excitement, comedy, action, suspense, drama. Totally odd excercise in ""quirk"" filmmaking. They tack on a cliche-ridden ""message"" about ""brotherly love"" at the very end. Is that the point of this bad movie? An hour and a half of boredom to get to a cheesy, cliched message that's been done a million times and a million times better? No idea why anyone would actually truly enjoy this movie."
1,Awesome movie - if we could see it,Apparently not all Blue Ray Disc's play on a Playstation 3 - this one doesn't!Love the move - wish we could watch it!
2,"Beyond Quirky, more like Weird","Qirky in my opinion is more like enjoyable in an odd sort of way. This movie is just plain weird. The plot I get. It's how they get there is the problem. From what I gathered, this little boy wants to enter his film in a contest of some sorts so he makes this movie with another kid in the school that is trying to escape from the ultra-religious family and church. But, then these exchange students come to his school and this one kid from France ends up being in the movie, and then the relationship between the little boy making the movie and the friend kind of begins to dilute.The story seemed to be set in the 1980's, although they really didn't specify particularly.This is not a movie for young kids. Too weird. More for adults.The beginning of the movie was promising, but as the movie went on it just fell flat. Judge for yourself. Rent it instead of buying it. I'm glad I rented it."
2,Not for region 'A' blu-ray players.,"This blu-ray is not compatible with region A players, regardless of the fact it says it is. Some clarification would have been nice and should be added to the description so that future purchasers are aware prior to buying. However, the item was packed very well."
1,"Great movie, does not play in a U.S. PS3","After watching this movie streamed online, I like it so much I opted to buy the blu ray. Unfortunately, despite a region ""A"" and ""B"" code on the back of the case, this does not play in my U.S. PS3, the screen just goes black and the only thing you can do is to quit playback and return the the PS3 main menu. Obviously this is a case of incorrect product labeling. I guess I can't really fault the seller, the disc should play according to the back of the case, but If your only blu ray playback device is a PS3 don't buy this. I give the movie 5 stars and this product that doesn't play as advertised in region ""A"" 1 star."
2,Son of Rambow,"Bought it for my grandson. He saw the preview on another DVD where it appeared to be an action adventure of a couple of boys about his age. He really liked it, however it contains alot of potty language, kids behaving badly, and a school out of control."
3,Not a teaching product,This book is an okay book as it has the latest updates in it. But I had purchased it for a teaching aid and it didn't have a diagram and explanation of the Rosary itself.
3,"Nice, but not what I'd been hoping for","I have been looking for a rosary prayer book that gives relevant scripture phrases between the ""Hail Mary's."" I was hoping this would have that, but it doesn't. Should have listened to the one-star reviewer. The pictures are nice, though."
1,Go elsewhere,"I only read a third of this novel and was compelled to put it down. Two main things bothered me: Benson's style and her content. First of all, this is her first novel and it shows. The ""archaic"" style of the 14th-century segment is laughable. Generally, the pacing is simply incompetent. It is a plodding recitation of events which follow one another step by step by step by step... Benson made me appreciate once again how skilled suspense writers know which events in a narrative to stress and which to put side by side to create excitement and anticipation. Secondly -- and this is going to be rude -- Benson comes across as a dull person with nothing to say: her asides are pedestrian and unimaginative. I'm not expecting Milan Kundera in such a novel, but this makes me lack the slightest desire to hold a conversation with her.In short, there are great suspense novels being written all the time. Read them INSTEAD!"
5,the burning road,I thought the burning road was a wonderful book. Also the plague tales was equally good. I eagerly await the next book from Ms. benson.
2,Parts are good....,"I really enjoyed the first few chapters of this book, and went so far as to recommend it to a friend at that point. When I finished, I told my friend 'nevermind'. In the beginning, the sci-fi part is intriguing, and the historical part is entertaining. But after a little while the futuristic half of this book goes downhill pretty quick. Virtually all the major characters are medical experts, yet they ALL react to the possibility of the BLACK FREAKING DEATH PLAGUE making a comeback as if they were addle-brained children. In short, the characters are unforgivably, annoyingly stupid. The historical part of the book is much better, but still could use improvement. At times I checked the front cover to make sure there wasn't an oil painting of Fabio on it, the book read so much like a Harlequin romance. (Or what I assume one would be like). I'm especially disappointed because it seems like there's a really good book hiding inside there somewhere, tryin! g to get out."
5,This book is a fantastic read...,"I was fortunate enough to buy this book for a dollar at a library sale. What a buy! I can't put the book down. A well written and interesting story. I hope to find more books written by her. She is as good a writer as Ann Rice, actually better.She would be a natural to write a trilogy of some sort. I look forward to more books by Benson, this time I will pay full price."
2,"Good historical perspective, poor microbiology knowledge.","A good story, with good historical background. However, Ms. Benson should have reviewed some basic microbiology before writing her book. It would have been much more credible and satisfying to knowledgable readers if her desciptions of the plague organism, Yersinia pestis, were something close to accurate."
3,"Very engaging storyline; characters needed more ""depth""....","I love medieval history, so this book instantly grabbed me. Well, truth is it never let me go! I could not put this book down and the technique of going back and forth between the 14th and the 21th centuries was very well done. I do agree however, that the characters needed to be better developed in terms of common sense. There were parts of the futuristic account that seemed to detract from the storyline for no apparent good reason (i.e. the train ride burglar chase...what was that about?). All in all, I'll recommend this book as fun to read, great storyline, great presentation of historic material and VERY engaging suspense."
3,A good book with some minor flaws - I'd read the sequel,"Okay, it's hard to imagine a biolab tech (and a very good one according to the story) who has no idea what Y. Pestis is in the neurotically infection-phobic future. But, give that a miss and you get a pretty darn good story that is well told. The 14th century sections are particularly well done and neatly deliver a fictional take on the same horror Barbara Tuchman's 'A Distant Mirror' covered as history. The near future sections are a little weaker and the people do behave oddly once or twice but then again, they are supposed to be living in a very odd time. Overall, I have recommended the book to several people and I bet I read the sequel."
2,worst ending of a book I've ever read,"I can't remember the last time I actually screeched when I finished the end of a book--it was completely unbelievable and tacked on! Most of the modern characters were barely sketched-in so I don't know why I cared. The only thing that saved it for me was the descriptions in the 14th century part, though I agree with many readers that the connection between the two parts was tenuous at best. The Doomsday Book was much better--at least I wasn't rolling my eyes in disbelief."
3,Entertaining but a little slow,"This book takes some time to get into, but once you do the story is good."
2,"Good premise, cheesy writing","Benson has managed to remind me of Dan Brown, with all of the bad writing and none of the interesting research. The premise seemed interesting--tale set in the future and the past, with similar events.Unfortunately, the writing was so bad that I, as a respectable Creative Writing major at a university, could not get through more than the first five pages. If you like endless cliches, bad dialogue, and thousands of thoughts in italics, pick up the new John Grisham and skip this mediocre tale."
3,"A good read, some interesting history, but wooden people","Benson did the 14th century better than the 21st which says something about this book _ She's good at historical research but not polished enough to give us more than wooden contemporary characters. Overall, it's an interesting read if you don't take the characters too seriously. One example: a Jewish doctor in 14th century Spain suffers all sorts of indignities for his faith, yet gives it up with little remorse for the love of a fair English maid. At least give him a little Jewish guilt ...If you want to read about a plague, try Stephen King's ""The Stand.'' King's 1,300 pages are effortless; Benson's 650 are tortured and should be no more than 400."
2,A plague of bad fiction,"Is it science fiction? Is it romantic? Is it fantasy? The author can't seem to make up her mind and we end up reading an uninteresting, silly story. The premise and the reviews lured me into buying this. I put it down numerous times because I couldn't read any further yet I kept picking it up in hopes that it HAD to get better. It didn't."
4,"Pretty good, but.....","I enjoyed this book, up to the Epilogue. I liked most of the characters, but would have liked to have known more history of the contemporary characters. I enjoyed the historical aspects of the story more than the near future - which didn't seem terribly futuristic to me. There just was not enough explanation as to how the Epilogue came to be. It seemed like an afterthought and not a well thought out one at that. I felt a little cheated and it took away a lot of the enjoyment from the rest of the book for me."
2,Interesting story falls apart in the last quarter,"Science fiction in general requires the reader to suspend belief in order to enjoy the story. This novel is no exception. I was enjoying this book until about the last quarter of the book. Then the characters began acting in such an unbelievable way that I found my self actually angry with the author! I am not a critical reader. However, I can not remember when I was more disappointed with a story's ending."
3,Just barely enough plot to hold interest.,Not a terrible book but somewhat disappointing. Much more could have been done in terms of storyline and character development. The ending was a letdown.
3,VERY UNORIGINAL,"I've read something too similar before: The Doomsday Book (1964). If you want more sci-fi and more in-depth history, I recommend you try the original story. But not a bad effort in any case..."
1,A Disappointing Book,"After reading reviews and the hype, I was disappointed in this book. The two stories never really connect, and in the modern story, though it has an intriguing premise in the health police idea, the characters never come to life, nor is the resurrection of the ancient germ really plausible. The medieval story also has flaws. The author clearly knows very little about either the Middle Ages or Jews and Jewish customs. For a start, the idea that the hero could walk into a bishopric and murder the bishop (who, by the way, would almost never be alone, even sleeping) is absurd. This is just the beginning of many historical gaffs. The one redeeming aspect of the book is the attractive hero, who somehow comes through as sympathetic through all the unbelievable situations."
2,"Good ideas, but seriously flawed","Ann Benson began with a fascinating concept, a post-biological-disaster near future in which freedoms have been sacrificed to protect society from potential contagion, and a parallel story of a young Jewish doctor in plague-ridden medieval Europe. Unfortunately, she rapidly lost control of both her plots and her characters. The modern story became a string of bizarre coincidences, while the medieval one brought in mystical or occult elements that never really meshed with the high-tech future. Also, the contemporary, supposedly scientifically-trained characters repeatedly behave as if they are brain-dead. I kept hoping this novel would rise to the promise of its premise, but it disappointed me to its laboriously contrived end."
5,A Title For Your Review :),"If you are looking for a good (not great) suspense novel or if you're a not-so-deep-into-the-field Epidemiologist, this book is perfect. I am DEEPLY interested in any books about plagues, viruses, and epidemics. This book was wonderful. Wonderfully crafted, excellent plot, Easy to read without TOO many technical words or jargon. I read this 675-page book in about three days, which is RARE for the amount of free time I have. Worth the money, worth the time, and worthy of five stars from me, a humble reviewer."
3,actually a lyric and cord book,no a photoghy book like the author suggests which isnt a bad thing nut unless your going to play some michsel jackson songs on the piano this is not the book for you the thing that was nice for me as a fan was to finaly being able to read what the heck hes saying cause sometimes hes hard to understand
4,Pretty good so far,the cables themselves are on the thin side but after schlepping the thing around for a month no problems at all.
5,Really nice for travel,I really like this. Cuts the clutter when I travel AND I use on my Mac Mini Intel. Keeps it neat and clean when not in use.Want to get the USB and iPOD version of this as well.
5,Excellent!,"I love this book! These two ladies grew old gracefully & with dignity, very positive role models. This is a very easy read book as well as encouraging & uplifting. I highly recommend this to anyone."
4,Work Well,Works well to make VHS labels on a full size sheet (as oposed to small labels). Slightly inconvienient that there are separate sheets for the VHS front (10 labelsd)and the side (15 labels). Was a bit disapponted in how few sheets there were in a package for the price
1,"Good Erotic Thriller, Bad Version","I saw this movie on cable some time ago, and thought of it as one of the better erotic thrillers. However I gave it just one star because I can't recommend it due to this version being heavily edited for content. There is nudity, but the sex scenes are quickly edited and cut virtually the second the characters touch each other. I'm sorry to say it would be a waste of money to buy this version given the unrated cable version is more complete. If you don't care about incomplete and edited love scenes, then by all means get this title. Otherwise save your money until you are SURE it's in its original unrated version."
2,Find a unedited version,Could have been quality soft porn but is just edited soft porn garbage. I don't know why these companies release these versions.
5,One of the best collections of apologetics essays,"This collection represents the best essays on apologetics, a must read for any person serious on Christian faith. If one thinks that there are no new ideas from these essays, he/she might have overlooked that these essays are deep rooted in the rich apologetics tradition and built on previous scholarly research, so any reader can get a quick overview on what arguments have been put forth for the topic discussed. Having said that, the overviews are not overly simplified. They are really high quality review essays and intellectually stimulating. This book is a must unless you have read all the literature on apologetics written over the entire course human history."
5,Every family should read this book,It was an excellent book on families struggling and how they made the family structure work.
5,"a charming, sly, and smart little play","Full disclosure: I haven't read this edition of 'The Pavilion.' However, I have worked on a production of the play, and think it's a wonderful piece. It's elegantly written, with two great main characters and dozens of secondary characters (all of the secondary characters are played by one narrator, making this a three-actor play). It's alternately hilarious and heart-wrenching, and since the pavilion itself (the play takes place in a pavilion on a large lake) is a metaphor for the universe, Wright shows us how the smallest decision can affect an entire universe (and vice versa). Wright is a terrific writer, and this is a great play."
3,not like I thought,"I have purchased Celine Dion-Belong in the past, but this order did not have the same lasting fragrance my first one had."
1,Bought it for less on a Target store clearance endcap...,"...and still wish I hadn't! Total piece of junk, complete waste of time and money...period. All the other reviews have summed it up quite well!"
1,Wish I read the reviews here before buying from another site,Doesn't do a darn thing it's supposed to. Not enough power to do anything!
1,What a disappointment - DO NOT BUY this,The METAL attachments are so dull and flimsy and the spining head can't withstand much if any pressure without coming to a complete STOP! A completely useless device that went directly into the trash - AFTER I had already spent another couple dollars on batteries!!! Grrrrr!!!
1,AWFUL,"This is one of the worst things I have blown my money on... what a waste. Although there was a good idea behind it, the inventor should have tested the product before putting it on the market."
2,Battery won't hold a charge,"I purchased this item but am returning it to Amazon. I used it a few times and it cleans reasonably well, but the battery won't hold a charge. It works for a short while (about 10-15 minutes) and then needs to be put back on the charger and then takes a long, long time to get charged back up - at least charged enough to run for 10-15 minutes agin. I'm asking them to send me a replacement. Hopefully the new unit will be better. If not, back it goes."
1,Didn't Work -- but ...getting replacement,Unfortunately this item did not work. They sent us a replacement and it ALSO didn't work. The good news is that they are sending us a THIRD replacement and we're crossing fingers that the 3rd time is a charm.
1,Remanufactured not NEW - false advertsement,"I ordered a RE-manufactured Scooba from Amazon and had to return it because it never worked. I searched Amazon again for a NEW one instead hoping to have better luck. I found one and ordered it. Nowhere did it say RE-manufactured anywhere on the description or title, instead it stated clearly ""NEW"" so I ordered it with confidence. I mean, it said NEW right? Now I get a message from Amazon after it is shiped and it NOW states REMANUFACTURED!? What-tha??? This is clearly false advertisement when I'm lead to believe I have a NEW product not newly remanufactured (which doesn't make sense). I'm extremely disappointed with Amazon's advertisement methods when they lead their customers astray. I have clearly received the same NON-working machine that I returned the first time!! The picture was even false.. not the new dark blue version but the light blue old one. False picture, false NEW, untrustworthy Amazon product...!!!"
1,These are ALL the Blue 5800's,"Received word back from Amazon customer service after I complained that I recieved a Blue 5800 when the listing clearly shows only the White 5900 and the model number on the listing is 5999. The customer service rep confirmed that in fact ALL of the Scooba's that have been, and will be sent out for this listing are the Blue 5800's. So if you are looking for a deal on a White 5900, look elsewhere.On the plus side, Amazon is accepting my return of the Blue 5800 for refund and are covering the postage back. Still a bit of a PITA when their misleading listing is what caused the whole thing though."
3,"Great concept, parts need improvement","It will relieve you of some of the housework (doesn't do corners), so great concept and minimal cost to run the cleaner. The body parts last about a year and company has poor customer service. So the old reliable mop stays until I see a new and improved version with sturdier parts, or the price on this drops significantly."
4,I Heart Robots,"I was so excited when my scooba arrived in the mail. I charged it overnight and hurriedly set it up for a test drive the next morning. I followed my instructions carefully and placed my scooba on my kitchen floor, pressed power, than pressed clean. I heard the cute little noise it made and then it start scooting around the floor. I was a little concerned when it just started spinning around but then I realized it was just calibrating the best way to clean the floor. It did a wonderful job. My floors are REALLY shiny BUT it doesn't clean the corners of the room. It left all the crumbs and dirt in the corners. It cleaned rather well underneath my kitchen cabinets and along the edges of the wall though. Another thing I wasn't too pleased about was the fact that my scooba doesn't dry the floor too well. Other than those two factors I love my scooba and will definitely be keeping mine. I'm looking forward to the day when I get a Roomba now. :)"
2,Worked for awhile,"Like many of the other reviewers, I was extremely happy with the job it did on my linoleum kitchen floor. Very easy to use, clean up wasn't that bad, and the cleaning solution left a fresh scent. However, after 4 uses, it no longer squirted the cleaning solution. The vacuum function seemed to still work. I tried all of the suggested fixes, but no luck. Luckily, returns were easy w/Amazon. I'm planning on buying the newest model directly from iRobot next time and am hoping all the bugs are fixed, cuz I loved having clean floors with no effort!"
5,I love my Scooba!!!,"This little gizmo works great! It does a wonderful job washing my hard floors. The only down side is that you only get a little bit of the Scooba Cleaning Solution, and I haven't been able to find any more at my local store. But you can use white vinegar, which is MUCH cheaper and works very well. What a life saver!"
1,It may work for only a few times.,"These robots work great in the first 2 months or so and the customers are very happy about it and they give great rating on the products. Once you use them for several months, you know the quality of the robots are poor. I have a scooba and 2 roomba and I can tell you my frustrated experience with them. The battery of scooba will die after 6-7 months of use. For about 30% of time, the scooba will not pick up dirty water. If you leave the scooba unattended for the cleaning cycle, you would probably see a very wet and slippery floor which you need to mop it again. There is no water in the dirty tank when I empty it because all the dirty water is left on the floor for my dog to lick. Once this scooba doesn't work, which I think will happen in 3-6 months. I will not buy it again. So much for the trouble. You really have to use them for some time before you see the robots' quality."
1,Died one week after warranty expired,"Brought Refurbished Scooba May 16. It worked fine and did about 20 washes. Turn it on Aug 16. It danced a few circles, stopped, ""I am stuck"" light turned on and beep 5 times. That error signal indicates the wheel may be the problem, checked wheel which was OK. Considering a refurbished Scooba cost $170 and last only 3 month, should have got a new one, which cost $220 and last at least one year - new machine has one year warranty."
1,"""I am stuck"" light is lit with 5 Beeps","I have purchased refurbished Scooba. It did not work even couple of times. ""I am stuck"" light is lit with 5 beeps. This means that there is some problem with the wheels. I have checked the wheels and they are fine.It is total waste of money and effort. I should have bought a new one with 1 year warranty."
1,Regret Purchase,"I purchased this after a friend strongly recommended it. Unfortunately, I have had a completely different experience. When I tried to use the scooba for the first time it would not move at all. The recommendation from their tech support worked. Yet, it is still a disappoint. One of the benefits of the scooba, is that it picks up the dirty water. Mine doesn't. This problem has not been resolved by tech support. I recommend you save your money and get your husband to do it."
4,Works OK,"I had a Roomba for some time and I am very satisfied with it, so I decided to try the Scooba. When I turned it on it keep showing the blue light. After opening and closing some times, moving the battery, the filter and the vacuum port, it started to run, but no solution came out. I was seriously considering shipping it back. Then after a few days I read the suggestions in the web site again and went through then carefully. I am not sure exactly what was the problem, but probably the battery instalation was the key and it started working correctly. It does a decent job. I am happy now, but I understand that many people will have a hard time, which is why I took out one star. Design a more reliable product."
4,Scooba is handy but a not hassle free,"I love the fact that you can start it and walk away. It is a little trouble to get ready though, because it has to be charged each time before you use it, so you can't just decide to use it at the last minute. Also, it is a little bit of work to clean it all up afterwards. You have to purchase special cleaner for it too, which isn't very convienent. You will need more than one virtaul wall though, so that will be an additional $30/wall. It is nice just to press a button and come back later to a clean floor!!"
2,works,"the remanufactured scooba works well. no problems. however it didn't look new. scooba didn't work to my expectation, and would not pay retail for it. scooba don't seems to be as smart as the roomba, which i also have.4 stars for jobs it does at the price, 160.00 i paid, but if i paid full price for it i would return it.edit overduei really only used it 4 or 5 times before it died. I trashed it. now 2 stars."
3,Ok machine for light cleaning,"I bought this machine to clean my tile floors AND my wood floors. Well, it ended up working reasonably well on the wood floors as they are a flat surface. It was even able to go under the sofas to clean. I ran the dust mop before using it and let it run while I ran out to work. The dirt that came off the floor was amazing!My tile floors were another story...they are an uneven stone floor and the scooba kept resetting its cycle with every bump it would hit. It was also unable to reclaim the water that it lost in the grooves.Overall, I would recommend this for light cleaning, completely flat surfaces."
5,WOW,I THINK IM IN LOVE!hahaha well i just got a job and i dont have much time to clean my house as often as i used to ( mop twice a day) and paying a maid wasnt worth it too much waste of money for slopy jobs since i wasnt at home to supervice.i simply love it. it goes over the floor several times.
5,Amazing,"This device works very well. I think the squeegee-like cleaning process and the fact that it does not continually reuse dirty water (like mopping out of a bucket) is part of the reason for its effectiveness. If it continues to work as it has been doing I'd buy it again (and again, and again...)"
1,"Good,when you can get it to work properly!!!","I bought this for my parents for Christmas 2007,and it's great when it works,a pain in the @!$#? when it does not,this contraption was expensive,and should work,hands down,even got a replalecement from Irobot,and it had the same Clean Tank issue,sure it works some of the time,but for over 200 bones I want to work most,if not all the time,my mother even gave it a name ""Penelope"",kinda corny but that my Mom,who I love very dearly,the reason I got this WAS to save cleaning time for them(my parents),BOTH are over 60 with some medical problems to boot,and they also have custody of 2 of their wonderful grandkids,my nephews who we LOVE dearly!!! Well to keep it short i'll stick to the old fashioned ,broom & dustpan,mop,or swiffer wet,it's still faster than the Scooba,and cheaper too!!!"
1,Disappointment,"I have a back problem so I was really looking forward to this little scrubber. I charged it up, filled it up (found that the requisite cleaner was not available at any local supermarket so I purchased it online and paid shipping) and turned it loose. It sweeps beautifully but will not discharge liquid to do the scrubbing. It does, however, provide limitless amusement to my two small dogs."
3,irobot floor scrubber,"it is a good unit works well. only problem I had was with the one click purchasethru amazon, I didnt get the chance to use the ADVERTISED discount they offered, or any other options for discount. I did send an emial to amazon and got an automated response that they recieved it. when I tried to register with irbot they could not access the purchase. I am happy with irobot, VERY DISSAPOINTED with the amazon customer service. delay in info transfer was better, this could most likely be a five star sale"
1,Very DISAPPOINTED,"I was very disapponted in my Scooba. Only because it did not come with any of the ""normal"" attachments or charger. So all I got was a very expensive machine that I could not use since I could not charge it. I don't blame Amazon, I blame GrassTwo, the company that uses Amazon to sell off their re-furbed stuff. The description said nothing about not including the re-charger or other necessary attachment. Look online for the whole package if you are goint to buy this product........because it won't operate with out the other necessary parts."
3,Floor cleaner,"The remanufactured Scooba is good value.It's great on tiled floors but only if they are fairly level. It gets stuck on our very uneven brick kitchen floor but works well in the bathrooms and playroom. I haven't dared to use it on the wood floor because I think it would make it too wet.The instructions say not to bother vacuuming first, but it has to be fairly clean because there is only a small filter for collecting big bits.The dirty water is impressively black a the end of the cycle.It's a bit fiddly cleaning SCOOBA after use, but better than actually doing the job yourself.If it's a choice between ROOMBA and SCOOBA, buy ROOMBA -it's quicker and more agile."
3,My floors are still dirty.,"I live in a modest studio with hardwood floors and I wanted to find a way to keep my floors dirt-free. Before running iRobot the first time, I thoughoughly swept with the intent of running iRobot everyday and maintain the cleanliness. While I have not had any problems with the battery life of motor, my feet still get dirty when I walk around barefoot. En fin, iRobot is not a bad buy, but if you are looking for a thourough cleaning, you will most likely have to continue to sweep and possibly mop yourself."
2,Doesn't last long,"Worked pretty well when I first got it. Three months later, the darn thing lost its ability to pump and pick up water. It is now retired on a shelf in the garage."
3,"Cleans well, but only for short periods","I found this item easy to set up and use. It cleaned my terrazo floor quite well, but the battery doesn't last very long at all. This might be acceptable in apartments or homes with limited hard floors, but my entire house has a hard floor, making this a pain to use and charge so frequently."
3,"Good Customer Service, Reasonable Performance","There were some issues with the robot turning itself off when bumping into walls, and the service light coming on at strange intervals. After an email exchange with iRobot over about a week, they sent a new unit. The new unit is working as described, and does a pretty good job cleaning the floor."
1,Don't Buy It!,"I had one of the Scooba units for 14 months, just past the warranty. I might have used the unit two dozen times. It stopped working due to a malfunction of the start button. I spoke with a rep. who advised that I could send it back and get a re-manufactured unit at a cost of $200.00. No thanks. My last one lasted only a little over a year. At about $350.00 divided by 24 usages it comes to $14.00 each time it washed my floor, what a deal!. I explained this frustration to a customer rep. with little sympathy or consideration. Don't buy one!!!"
3,7 month later and still love it!,"I bought this item in March 2007 after purchasing the Roomba. I really like that you can use either the special Scooba cleaning solution or you can use vinegar and water. This item is easy to operate and cleans very well. However, I was stupid not to realize that with the rounded design it did not clean into corners or up close underneath the cabinets. I still have to clean those areas by hand. I still find myself from time to time using my ""Wet Jet"" instead because I do not have to clean that up when I am finished using it as I do with the Scooba, and the Wet Jet takes less time to complete the job. It is great, but has it's downside as well. One thumb up!"
3,It may be a 5800 with a 5900 battery,"I was also disappointed to receive a blue Scooba 5800 and called Amazon for a return, to which they agreed.However, I have since tested it to see how long the batteries would last and found that it did two complete tank cycles, which took a total of at least 90 minutes. The 5800 is supposed to be good for a single cycle, while the 5900 is supposed to be able to run two cycles between charges.So it may be that they are shipping 5800 bodies with 5900 batteries (I don't know how to visually differentiate between the 5800 vs 5900 batteries). I've read elsewhere that the color and battery are supposed to be the only diffence between the two models.I'll probably just keep mine."
1,Warning: 5800!,"Shipping was fast, but despite all the pictures showing a Scooba 5900, after opening the box it turned out to be a remanufactured 5800 (the darker blue, older model cleaning only 1/2 the area on 1 battery). Fortunately, the return process was easy and Amazon refunded the whole price (some sign of bad corporate conscience there?). With new 5900's starting at 239.-, 180.- for a remanufactured 5800 wasn't exactly great."
1,Total Gamble,"I bought two refurbished scoobas, one for me, one as a gift. One worked reasonably well. (It completes a cycle, and sucks up about half the water it puts out. I'm guessing that's roughly expected behavior). The other, sucked up none to just barely a tablespoon of water every time we ran it. Additionally, this defective scooba would *always* run out of battery before finishing a full cycle (it never went into the drying mode where the cleaning light flashes, and every time there was nearly a half cup to a cup of liquid left in the clean tank).Considering we followed the manuals to the letter, and one works and one doesn't, I doubt this is user error.For the price, I'm disappointed."
2,Too basic for developers,"As a Bluetooth baseband and applications developer, I found this book too basic to make much use out of. The only thing that I found useful is that they give some performance numbers here and there. My advice to you is to borrow this book for a quick thumb through and throw it away. The other Bluetooth book by Jennifer Bray, Bluetooth connect without cable, is even worse. You might as well read the spec itself, which is more precise and informative."
4,Jimmy D. Lane Blues,Pure Blues..not to be confused with Stevie Ray...Jimmi has his own style of playing the Blues...Great album...well worth the price !!!
5,It's definitely time!,Jimmy D is a fantastic musician. It is so pleasant to listen to his unique blues interpretation. Want to hear not from him.
5,Silent Souls Leave .308 Holes,"I can only hope that Mr. Hunter will continue the ""Bob Lee Swagger Series"". This great ride just cannot be over yet! There are several ""military-thriller"" novels out there, but Mr. Hunter's well researched and very detailed writing style is unmatched. If you have not read ""Point of Impact or Blacklight"", in that order, then do so and prepare for a great experience! Mr. Hunter, thank you for shedding the light on some real issues such as PTSD. Very Thorough! The Best!"
2,Too much sniping is NOT a good thing...,"Stephen Hunter's attempt to keep the hero worship of Bob the Nailer going is tired and overblown. Hunter manufactured outlandish plot devices in this book in a vain effort to maintain interest. Black Light and Point of Impact were taut, credible, and compelling, but A Time to Hunt was just one book too many. Enough of sniping, Mr. Hunter - time to come up with something new!"
2,"lacks depth, lots of implausible happenings","This wasn't up to his Point of Impact & Dirty White Boys. Like he talks to Julie in Idaho and (surprise, surprise) when he calls her back with info about the bad guy, the line is dead. Come on. I'm not done yet, but too many things are stretched way too thin."
5,My first Hunter's novel but not the last one,I am far frow being addicted to war novels. Usually I hate them. But I couldn't put down this book till I was finished. I loved it! Sure I will buy another.
5,Hunter gave himself and us a full perfect circle,"very nicely done this time, Mr. Hunter. Just finished this one in one sitting. There is only one small glitch that made it a bit unbelievable, the CIA turn-coat guy and all his sidekicks turning out to be all Soviet/Russia folks in the end? Wow, totally blew out of water, man. Anyway, except this too dramatic twist, these four-book ""Bob The Nailer"" series are just like four bottles of Burgandy, man, all primed from the vintage years and best of all, Mr. Hunter's writing also runs cooler like a chilled Chablis, pure, transparent, and clear-cut. Love it, and just wish someday there would be an anthology collecting all these four books in one binding."
3,Bob the Nailer does the job again,"Hunter continues the mostly unbelievable and stereotyped adventures of Bob Lee Swagger in this yarn, which is far too ambitious in tying together Vietnam, Communist conspirators, and the peace movement. That said, Bob Lee is a compelling character, if inconsistent from book to book, and Hunter does a fine job of setting up the suspense as well as writing dead-on dialogue. In this case, the denouement is an anticlimax, so I must rate it considerably lower than Point of Impact, but higher than the far-fetched Black Light."
4,Bob the Nailer is a hit,"Bob the Nailer is back! He gets a bit more complicated in each novel. I don't think that I could have put the book down if I had tried. This was better than 'Black Light' but not quite 'Point of Impact'. The plot was filled with suspense. But, be careful--Bob will 'Nail' you and you will be hooked! Very good."
4,Good book,Fills in a great deal of the Swagger history and allows us to see some meaning in Donny's death and the deaths of the anti-war people that Donny had grown to respect.If you are a Swagger fan this book is a must.
4,"Excellent, adventure, mystery novel with a touch of evrythng","Time To Hunt is an extraordinary novel. It touches on all almost every aspect including adventure, mystery and love. Hunter is trully a master and he easily excites the reader throughout. There is not a dead moment throughout the 600 pages. The length is well worth it. The book is filed with action, adventure and suspense up until the very last page. It is trully a compelling book that should be recommended to all. Hunter's style and technique displays visions of a master."
4,Great read! Brings Closure for all us Swagger fans,"Time to Hunt is a very engaging story and also puts a great end to the Swagger saga.Point of Impact is one of my all-time favorites. Now we need another deep character from Hunter with the same country-bred hard edge sense of values imparted on Bob Lee and Bud Pewtie. One that ""deals in lead friend"""
3,Good plot. stereotyped characters,"Fans of other Stephen Hunter books will not be disappointed in his new offering. Bob Lee Swagger returns and, like the other Swagger novels, the characters are mostly stereotypes but the author makes up for it in plotting, good well paced action and a Tom Clancy like bent for the details of the craft of violence. Though the Swagger character is little more than a John Wayne type and the attempt to give him faults falls flat the reader can't help but like him and root for him. That must be the strength of the writing then. If you liked Point of Impact or Black Light, as I did, you will also enjoy Time to Hunt. Nothing fancy, but a cut above the average thriller for sure."
5,Bob The Nailer Is The Man,I can't get enough of these stories. Stephen Hunter never disappoints. After reading these books we went out and extended the rifle range on the back of the property so we could try some longer shots! Rock on Bob the Nailer!
4,Another winner from Hunter,"Don't miss this one. If you've never read Hunter before, read Point of Impact then Black Light and then Time to Hunt,the Bob the Nailer books. Bob is one of my favorite all time fiction heroes, right up there with Clancy's Jack Ryan and John Clark and Frederick Forsyth's Sir Nigel Aubrey. This book doesn't disappoint. Full of action, character development and spirited dialog. PLEASE Mr Hunter, don't consider this the last Bob the Nailer book - we want more! P.S. you'll enjoy Hunter's other (not Bob the Nailer) books, too."
4,Good balance of suspense and not being lost,"I really enjoyed Hunter's storytelling in this novel. I wasn't prepared for the long historical setup for the book, but after a while I realized that the intro was a pretty good book all on its own. It has been a while since I've read an enjoyable book - I was begining to wonder.Thanks to Stephen."
3,Time to read a good book,"First Hunter book I read and the story was good enough to keep me intrigued to the end. I really liked the character 'Donny' but couldn't relate to Bob Swagger, he's just not my kind of hero. Very good book though. The first half is better than the second half of the book. I will try another Hunter book."
2,I almost quite reading before I got to the better parts.,"This book is a slow starter and its beginning is a lot to swallow. It gets more interesting and much more believeable once we arrive back in Nam but the whole thing was a little too contrived. This is one to many ""Bob the Nailer"" books."
3,Mixed Feelings about this book,"I've read about a handful of Hunter's books now and this book started off strong and then took a dive, but then got better. It was a roller coaster ride, but not in the good sense. It felt choppy and trite at times.I found that each sub-section at times made me feel like this was a novella forced into a full-length book. I finished the book and still had a feeling of disatisfaction. This book was not as strong as it could have been. It either should have been longer or needed better editing.And, there were some sections that were repetitive or the descriptors that were used were nothing short of the sort that made my eyes roll. I wouldn't go so far to warn another to not read the book, but be careul this is not the best read. But, heck, it beats the writing of some other popular writers in this genre."
3,"Too much gun stuff, too little plot development","I like Hunter's writing and I think I'd like Hunter, who seems like a thoughtful sort and is quite a good writer for this genre.But someone (maybe editor Esther Newberg?) caught Tom Clancy disease in this one. Hunter's far too good to fall into that trap, but he does. There's far too much technobabble, too many boring discussions of calibers and gun sights, and most of all, too much stalking through the jungles and the mountains.Too bad, because the plotline is good and the insight into the hangover from Vietnam is right on. But developing the plot, which hangs together from 1971 to 1997 would be far better than spending half the book on snipers stalking others and themselves.Maybe Hunter has ended the Swagger saga and has something new in mind. If so, I'll be there. But please, in English not in calibers."
1,no credibility,There's a reason authors are supposed to do research. It's so readers who have familiarity with the things he touches on will be able to continue to suspend their disbelief. Mr. Hunter did fine with me until he moved the setting to central Idaho. He must think no one in Idaho is taught to read and he was too lazy to find out anything about the town where he set the climax of the book. This was the first of his books I've read and the last because his credibility is so shot full of holes with me that I couldn't possibly take anything he writes seriously now.
4,Good Read,"May not be for everyone, but I have enjoyed every Bob Lee Swagger book I've read so far. I read at night and always ended up staying up too late."
4,New Favorite Writer!,Just discovered Stephen Hunter ...Time to Hunt was the second of his books I read in 4 days...Great writing style!
5,He ain't hunting deer!,"A good, multy faceted mystery with a fantastic ending. It ain't over till it's over. Just when you're reading about the theme of the book it ends and another one starts. Then you think you're about over the end punches you in the gut."
3,"Good read, but not his best.","This last episode of Bob Lee Swagger is well worth the read, as long as people read Point of Impact and Black Light first. The Washington peace movement and Vietnam war depictions are very well done. The second half builds the suspense very effectively. My only two complaints are that at times Swagger's class antagonism do not seem genuine. The other complaint is that Hunter copies a key plot sequence from his earlier Master Sniper. He may have the right to reuse his own stuff, but it is rather lazy. Still, Hunter is one of, if not the best writer of this genre."
2,Too much sniping is NOT a good thing...,"I enjoyed Point of Impact and Black Light a great deal, but this book seemed to me to be an unnecessary continuation of the hero worship of Bob Lee Swagger. The author has run out of fresh ideas, and his plot devices have become absurd and extreme. I was left wishing that I had stopped reading this ""series"" with Black Light, a very good book."
5,BRAVO TO STEPHEN HUNTER AGAIN!!,"TIME TO HUNT CAPTURES THE READER QUICKLY FOR A FAST-PACED THRILLING RIDE FROM THE ARIZONA MOUNTAINS TO WASHINGTON D.C. FOR A JOLTING ENTRY TO VIETNAM. WITHOUT ANY KNOWLEDGE ABOUT GUNS, I WAS ABLE SEE INTO THE FASCINATING WORLD OF THE MASTER SNIPERS, BOB LEE SWAGGER AND SOLARATOV. THE INTRICATE DETAIL OF EACH SHOOTING TURNS THE NOTCH UP TO A BREATH-HOLDING MOMENT FOR THE READER. ""BOB THE NAILER""COMES MORE ALIVE WITH HUMAN FAULTS AND FAILINGS IN THIS LATEST BOOK. LANCE CORPORAL DONNY FENN PROVES TO BE A GENUINE MARINE IN HIS EXPERIENCE WITH THE LONG-FORGOTTEN VIETNAM ERA. I COULD FEEL ALL THE CONFLICTS OF THAT TIME PERIOD THROUGH ALL THE CHARACTERS THAT EXISTED WITH HIM. THE ANXIOUS MOMENTS FROM SOLARATOV'S CROSSHAIRS ON HIS TARGETS, TO BOB'S TENSION-FILLED PARACHUTE JUMP, GRIPPED AND HELD ME BREATHLESS WHILE READING. I THINK FANS AND NEW READERS WILL ENJOY THIS THRILLER AND EAGERLY AWAIT STEPHEN HUNTER'S NEXT NOVEL."
3,ripped a week in,Was over joyed when I received this product but the hole for the loop was made to high or something because in no time it had ripped right through gohan's hair :(
2,"It at least teaches how to read instructions, I suppose","When it began at the end of the seventies, the Lego Space range started as inventive and highly flexible - you could build all manner of things out of even small sets. This high quality progressed throughout the eighties and early-to-mid nineties. But in recent years lego space sets have become very tacky and gimmicky. There were the hologram stickers and the red/blue filters of the Exploriens sets, which were fair enough. But more recently space sets have employed the use of big specialized pieces which limit scope for alternative building and often make the sets look ugly and clunky. The eyes, pre-printed wings and light-and-sound box can really only be used in Insectoid sets, the insect-person minifig looks ridiculous and the use of magnets to hold those two little ships in place makes the whole thing far too wobbly and unstable."
1,Did nothing for my eyelashes,What a waste of time and money. Did not lengthen or thicken my eyelash.
5,My hero,"Otis Redding was my musical hero. Like so many millions of fans, his songs touched my very soul, and still do today. It was through this biased lens that I read this book. The events of Otis's short life have been well documented by now, but never so fully before. Readers get to know the real Otis in all his majesty and faults. Time heals all wounds, and its easy to forget the impact Otis's death had. Similarly time dulls memories of accomplishments, and lest we ever forget Otis's many contributions I hope this book will find a wide audience. The research has been done with painstaking care. The writing manages to stay objective, even through the author obviously is deeply involved in his subject. Thank you for this work. It's a book I'll read again every few years, just as surely as I return to Otis's recordings regularly to recall why I love his music."
1,hot air cooler,"this is the worst item i have ever ordered anywhere.it does not work it blows hot air.20lbs, i live upstairs, i am 62 years old.if i could take it to the target store in tulsa i might.it does not work."
2,Not what I hoped :(,"Item specs suggest that it can handle a room of up to 100 sq ft. Mine was unable to cool a 32 sq ft area. I was trying to use this to cool my tent by 5 degrees, and this couldn't do it. the overall design is nice, and if this thing could cool better (maybe a different kind of pad ?) it would be perfect. Its easy to use, The ""swing"" feature is nice, but in the end it was an overpriced fan with little blowing power."
4,Need to Bridge Gap,"Some of the material covered I have seen nowhere else. The author correctly identifies the all important psychological effects associated with shooting and shooting well. However, there is much more that could be said, with accompanying detail as necessary, on the finer points of shooting. Further development of ideas and techniques for breathing, holds and grips of the rifle, trigger action, and handling recoil consistently are items that need further expansion. It is a good text, however, for an intermediate shooter more is needed. Another very beneficial area would be to have a few more pictures with annotated diagrams addressing the finer points discussed in the text."
3,"Good, but has flaws","I don't doubt the authors experience, but some of the advice in the book is lacking and/or dubious. For example, the section on what equipment to buy basically says ""See what the pro's are using & buy the same"", but takes several pages to make a point. I didn't think this good advice at all, what if their equipment is not suitable for me ? How do I determine what suits ME best, the book did not even cover that ! It may be OK for some, but I feel the book is not aimed at my (basic) level."
5,Smallbore Position Shooters Bible,"I am still a fan of the first edition of this book, and I hope reviewer J.Crawford reads that edition because all phases of position rifle shooting are covered. Bill Pullum and Frank Hanenkrat are simply the best resource for competitive position shooters - nothing else comes close to their expertise. They addressed mental training for the shooting sports long before it gained widespread acceptance. This book (and the first edition) are MUST HAVES!"
3,basic book keeping,I can not review / do not really use it / started / then forgot to use. Sorry can not reall review this product
2,Not User Friendly,"I guess I am just too dumb, but I did not find Quicken easy to use. The help menu is useless. The screens are hard to understand and the menu names do not make sense.I used to use an Excel spreadsheet and I think I will just go back to this."
1,Stay with Quicken 2002,"Whoever designed this upgrade must have been a cartoonist. It's terrible. Gone are the easy to read full screens, lists, reports... Everything has a help section on the side, the bottom, etc... So the data you're looking for has a smaller screen to display on. Quicken ads and Quicken services bully themselves everywhere... If there is a way to take my data back to the 2002 format, please let me know"
2,Risks Using Quicken,"Before you give Quicken such a favorable review, you might want to check the 4 month problem they have had with Credit Card downloads. These have compromised the integrity of customer financial records. Their final solution has been to have customers manually check 4 months of statements and enter missing transactions by hand.In the course of this problem they gave out incorrect information stating how soon the problem would be fixed, and stating that when fixed one would be able to download the missing transactions. For months they did not even inform customers that the problem continued past the original June 24 deadline.Howard Sloane"
3,It All Depends On What You Want To Do.,"This program works if you are not planning on doing complicated banking procedures at home. I use it only for balancing my checking, saving, credit cards, loans and updating my useless stocks. In other words, I do not use it for anything else, like PAYPAL or check printing, which some people have had problems with. Why did I even buy this? I upgraded to Windows XP which, surprise, surprise, does not ""recognize"" Quicken 2000. I spent the extra bucks and am now happy. It's fine for the basics. Unfortunately, when you upgrade one Microsoft, you have to upgrade another. That's why they are rich are we are poor. One last item which caused me to give 3 stars - support is virtually non-existent. There is no (800) number and intuit just doesn't get back to you with anything other than advising you to check your HELP sections. It's only money, right?"
1,this software sucks.,This software does a terrible job to match the short sale and cover short transactions in my brokerage account. I have to manually specify those transactions to the right types ONE BY ONE and it still couldn't calculate the trasaction proceeds correctly. It is so frustrating. It wastes both money and time to use this software to track capital gains.
1,Buy Quicken 2002 Instead,"I have used Quicken from the beginning and updated annually, but I'm tossing 2003 Basic and going back to 2002. Quicken 2003 has adopted a Microsoft-style ""do it our way"" format that makes their product harder to use.This user unfriendly version takes away user control of the desktop, and much of the intuitive navigation that made earlier versions winners.2002 was a vintage year for Quicken, but the 2003 version should be avoided."
1,Frustrated in Seattle,"I read the comments from the 2003 users where people suggested buying the 2002 version-I did buy Quicken 2002-and it[s bad] too! I can't imagine how bad the 2003 version must be that people thought this was better. From what I can tell, Quicken Basic is just a tool the company uses to sell you more expensive software that might be useful and [pull] you into using their financial services. IT IS A MARKETING TOOL FOR QUICKEN-NOT SOFTWARE YOU SHOULD PAY FOR! Anything you try to do, Basic will tell you can't do, unless you upgrade to Deluxe. In addition, my overall impression is that Quicken despises their customers. I cannot imagine using a company with such low morals to handle my portfolio. This software won't do anything your bank's Internet site can't do, other than put all your information in one place. You will be disappointed if you actually pay for this software."
1,Quicken 2003 is a downgrade,"I've used Quicken for a number of years, and it generally worked OK. The interface was always a little quirky and you had to learn that certain operations never worked quite the way it seemed they should. However, I spent a few years overlooking that, until I decided to start using the online banking option. I bought the new version, Quicken 2003, and couldn't be less satisfied.My only serious gripe is that over half the time I select ""Update Now"", to download new transactions and upload new bill payment orders, Quicken crashes! I religiously patch it, load a web page first to make sure my cable modem hasn't gone to sleep, I stand on one leg, but to no avail: I invariably get a popup with the text ""An OLB error has occurred in the last task .."" I press OK and it crashes. Not exactly how you want the software handling your banking to work!My recommendation: don't upgrade or buy something else."
3,Worth a read.,"Marley discovers she's part of a business deal her Father has made with her...fiance. Humiliated and trying to be impulsive, possibly for the first time, she takes off on an adventure to Las Vegas. Marley arrives and starts to party only to wake up the morning after MARRIED and with no idea to whom she married.A nice love story. A nice light read."
1,Just Say No,"Intuit's attempt at putting advertising in a product that you are paying [$$] for is unacceptable. I have been a loyal Quicken user since the DOS versions, however this sneaky attempt by Intuit has made me re-think my loyalties. I ordered Quicken and promptly returned it upon learning of this unwelcome feature. If you are a current Quicken user, CONTINUE USING YOUR CURRENT VERSION. We can all tell Intuit to stop this invasion by boycotting their products until they remove the advertising or at least give us the option of disabling all advertising. As a result of my experience with this product, I will even discontinue my purchases of their Turbo-Tax software."
1,"OK, enough with the yearly versions","Getting a little sick of this strategy. The level of advertising associated with you using this product should more than offset treating the yearly upgrades as simple updates instead of having to pay for a whole new version. It's a great product, but hindered by advertising overload and an overly ambitious sales program. You really don't need this version, 2002 works fine. (As does 2001, 2000, etc....). I could see spending [money] if you own the previous year's version, but this is ridiculous."
3,"Much better than Quicken 2001, hardly better than 2002","I just upgraded from Quicken 2001 and I can at least say this version is better. Yes, there are some ads that try to sell Intuit services, but they don't do anything more than take up some screen real estate on a few pages.I've seen Quicken 2002 and it appears that 2003 is a very minor upgrade. Is it worth the price? Probably not. Is it better than updating your check book manually? You betcha!I'd definitely recommend Quicken to anyone who doesn't have it already, but not to someone upgrading from Quicken 2002."
1,Not as good as the 2002 version.,"I bought the 2003 version and was appalled by all the changes just so they could call it a update. It means you have to learn the program over again. They also denied my rebate because I didn't jump through the hoops just right. By the time I found out about not getting the rebate, it was too late to return it. I've used Quicken from version 4 for DOS, but will not buy again unless they change their greedy ways. So get a 2002 version instead, it's cheaper and better. I saved the quicken.ini file in the Windows directory using notepad, calling it quicken.txt. If I have to reinstall Quicken, I copy the paragraph under [Registration]from the original file and paste it in the new ini file. This allows full use without having to try to register it again."
1,I'm tired of the problems,I'm tired of the problems with this software and the charge for customer support.
1,Use the $$ for an Upgrade to buy your wife dinner,"I had Quicken 2000 on an older machine and when I purchased a new one, I thought I might upgrade. Boy was that a mistake! I actually got my money back and restored my 2000 program. Spend the $$ for the upgrade on a dinner for your loved one and don't commit to the hours and hours of time needed to set up and baby the product."
2,"Thanks, Amazon: No Quicken","I just read the reviews and took Quicken out of my cart. I too have been a user since MoneyCounts that Quicken bought in the beginning. The ads referred to in the reviews are unacceptable. I am just fine with ""last years model"" and shall remain that way unless I find a substitute with value. This is my rejection of empty upgrades. Thanks, Amazon. You'll get the sale but on another product."
1,Waste of time and Money--no support,"Quicken 2003 is a ...software package, not up to contemporary professional standards. I have been running it with W2k for 2 months with some off and on annoying problems, however, now my the program will not read my data file or my backups. Intuit will talk to you...for a fee...or restore the data that their lousy product fouled .... Do not waste your time. Do not waste your money. Another great annoyance is the commercialism in the software, constantly pitching Quicken credit cards, brokerage, tax products, etc. Avoid this product at all costs."
1,DO NOT WASTE MONEY!,"I am a LONGTIME Quicken fan, and this ""upgrade"" is a serious step backwards rather than an upgrade. There are MANY bugs, including the fact that the software shuts down when you try to print a report, that you can no longer work while downloading transactions, and that many of the ""easy edit"" features have now disappeared. Despite the marketing glitz, I can find ZERO improvements and numerous things lacking from the 2002 version. If I can figure out how to downgrade my file, I'll be returning my product for a refund."
2,The messed up a good product,"Intuit took a great product and ruined it. There are so many ways to set up the screen that you can't find anything or do anything without searching through menus to see where it is. It is not intuitive at all. I've used this product (and Quickbooks) for years, so I'm familiar with the program. Now I get lost. Besides the unpleasant design of the software, it's also buggy. If I try to switch to VIEW 1, it crashes. I use Windows 2000 for stability, and very few programs crash. This one is an exception. Stay away from this software until they fix the interface and stabilize the bugs."
1,Moved to Money,"I am glad I moved to Money. I highly recommend trying it out. It has much better interface with a very smooth integration with browser. Abundant reporting and investment charting possibilties. I was a avid quicken user for 7 years. Tried Money because it was bundled with Taxcut and boy, am I glad that I have moved. BTW, I did not buy Turbotax (I was a long time user of it) because of the c-dilla issues. INTUIT has just lost a loyal customer forever ..."
1,I'm in tears!,"I started with Quicken version 1.0 and was delighted. Each upgrade was like going to the candy store to see what great features were added. The last great version of Quicken was 6.0. Since then, each upgrade has been a disappointment. There are memory leaks that prevent using the product for over 8 hours on my computer before hanging and having to reboot (Quicken99). I was thinking of upgrading to Quicken2003, but after reading the reviews, I am at a loss. I think I'll just go back to Version 6.0 and be happy again!Old versions had no advertising."
1,I hope Intuit is reading these!,"Thanks to everyone who has reviewed this software, I've found these some of the most useful reviews I've read anywhere on Amazon. I'm a user of Quicken Deluxe 2000, I upgraded from Quicken 98 with some reservations, but I've been very pleased with 2K. My bank, however, just switched servers so that I can no longer update my transactions with two clicks of the mouse. Thanks to these reviews, I'm not going to waste my money and aggravate myself by buying 2003. I can still use the old method of downloading a .qif file and updating my bank transactions that way.If Intuit wants to sell me a new piece of software, they had better have something much better -- meaning a simple interface and NO advertisements! -- to offer in 2004 or 2005, when I'm willing to consider it again."
3,The end of Software as we know it.,"I've been a loyal user of Quicken for more years and upgrades than I can remember--but the new UI with forced, incessant advertising has me seriously considering cleaning this crap off my computer and reverting to 2K.I PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE. I DON'T WANT TO SEE ADS SQUEEZED INTO EVERY MARGIN ON MY () SCREEN."
1,"Quicken 2003 no better than previous versions, maybe worse.","I'm not sure if I would be considered a power user of quicken or not. I have over 20 accounts in it, a 401(k) account, a couple of mortgages, etc. I have used Quicken since MYM passed away. The first versions of Quicken were ""Okay"". Being a tenacious optimist, I keep updating the program in the hopes previous bugs would be fixed. THEY ARE NEVER FIXED! Quicken 2003 Deluxe is just as full of bugs as ever. Mortgages aren't handled correctly. Data from previous versions disappears forever. Alerts aren't calculated correctly. You can ""submit"" bug reports and suggestions, but I suspect they're dumped somewhere in the ether.One reason I tried this update was that I was told you could ""chat"" with tech support via the internet without paying the support fee. After spending over an hour with a tech, I was again told I had found yet another ""product defect"".(...)"
1,"Quicken 2003 disappointing ""again"".","I miss my Managing Your Money. I went to Quicken several versions ago when MYM was no longer produced and supported. With every update I hope the program will get better and it's many bugs fixed. But the program continues to have bugs where they shouldn't have any. In other words, the programmers are sloppy and high schoolish. Some negative values don't show up in red. Credit card maximums and minimums don't calculate properly (in a money management program?). You have to pay for live support - even if the problem is theirs. My fingers are crossed that some one else will come up with a money management program so Quicken will wake up and do the job right. Try MS Money instead."
4,Reliable bookkeeping,"The only drawback is the excessive amount of implanted commercial links to sell more services. The product itself is outstanding but why should the user have to pay for all these links to goods and services built into the product. It is hard or impossible to remove these imbedded ""features"" when not wanted."
1,Switched to Money,"Ordered Quicken 2003 when having problem with bank interface. Worked OK until I bought new PC and tried to move program. Would not work unless I bought another disc from Intuit. After many wasted phone calls & on line sessions with Intuit customer service (HA HA) I gave up and switched to MS Money installed on new PC. Works great, much smoother with bank interface.Didn't find upgrade of Quicken to be anything special. With hassle using customer service, this is one ex-Intuit customer."
1,Where are my entries?,"I wrote ckecks that have dissapeared from the check register. After reading the previous reviews of this program, I can understand why."
1,"I'll stay where I am, thank you.","I was about to order Quicken 2003, but after reading the reviews, I've changed my mind. I've always liked Quicken and have been upgrading on a regular, if not yearly, basis. After reading the reviews here, I'll pass this year and stick with my 2001 version. For new users, there are a number of online vendors that still sell Quicken 2001 and 2002. If Q2003 is as bad as has been reported, I recommend to all first time buyers that they purchase an older version of Quicken."
2,Too many Ads?,"I have 2001 Deluxe and already tired of ads at times but after reading through the reviews here, thanks but I'll wait until quicken removes those ads as they mention it here. I will say it one more time, If I pay for the product, better no ads. I will check again next year. My 2001 worksfine and have no problems with it."
1,Ratings of 2003 discouraging,"I am using Quicken Deluxe 2000. I have used quicken for years and been very satisfied, but the comments concerning 2003 have turned me off to upgrading. I was upset when they changed the format the had in 1999 with the 2000 version. It sounds as if they ""change for the sake of change"" with greed being the motive. I have grown very tired of greed being the motivator disguised as profitability in our society. What happened to GOOD SERVICE. Good service leads to profitability and it sounds as if 2003 fails in that regard. (Please note, I have not tried it, nor do I intend to now. It sounds like a waste of money.)When I see customer comments that Quicken is doing the job it it supposed to do, and it is clear they have cleaned up the idiosyncracies, I will consider upgrading. In the meantime, if is isn't broke, don't fix it. (I wonder if this and the othe messages will find their way to Quicken management)."
1,WOW...Glad I didn't buy it!,"WOW! I've used Quicken for many years and really like it. I was just about set to download 2003 Deluxe when I decided to look at the reviews and was STUNNED! I have Quicken 2000...it's working fine and meets my needs...and I see NO reason to update anything until Intuit addresses what appears to be many, many unacceptable bugs and ""features."" Thank God I found these reviews before I wasted my money and made things worse! Thanks to all of the reviewers!"
2,Quicken 2003,"I did not purchase Quicken 2002. I figured I would wait for 2003, because it would surely be significantly better. But I keep hearing that it is trememdously commercial, constantly goading me to sign on to quicken products. Now, I hesitate to upgrade. I love the product. Wish I had bought stock in it years ago, but I don't want to be faced with a comercial bombardment. Why should I pay them to hit me with commercials all the time??? What should I do ?"
2,Who wants to see commercials when writing checks?,"How sad! An excellent home finance program has morphed into a commercial billboard. After being a loyal Quicken user for 7 years or so, I upgraded from Quicken 2000 hoping for a few bug fixes (reports, budgets). Instead I got so many distractions I can't concentrate on what I use the program for. The older versions had some kind of ""turn off advertising"" switch - but not this one. I guess this one may have to ""go back to the store"" although I hear getting a refund is nigh onto impossible."
1,Check 2002 Reviews,Check out the Amazon customer reviews for the 2002 and 2003 versions of Quicken and TurboTax. Average point scores (stars) for both software packages have dropped by about one point from last year to this year.Stay away from 2003-version products from Intuit.
3,Backup bug,"I have been using Quicken since version 1 for Windows. I have been upgrading every 2 years. My last upgrade was 2001. In June my hard drive crashed. I thought, ""No problem, I have been backing up regularly."" I was using the Quicken backup feature to backup on to another computer on my home LAN. Boy was I shocked when I found that the last time it had actually been backed up was October of the previous year - 8 months of data gone. I was going to upgrade to 2003 hoping that they had fixed this bug, but I guess I will wait for the next release because of the bad reviews."
1,Not worth the money,"I was going to transfer from an EOM version of Money 99 to Quicken 2003. There were too many problems switching, plus you CAN'T TURN OFF THE ADS! I returned this item and got Money 2003, which is great, and YOU CAN TURN OFF THE ADS!"
1,slooooow,"I have been a loyal Quicken user, but this product has been a disaster. I have plenty of memory, according to its requirements, but that doesn't seem to matter. The program is achingly slow. A previous reviewer wrote that it takes three seconds for a pull-down menu to appear. I wish! It takes 15 to 20 seconds for me. Imagine how long it takes when I try to do something more complicated. Also, many of the new features are not intuitive. I've had enough frustration to switch back to try to switch back to an earlier version of Quicken--or to Microsoft Money."
2,Quicken 2003 breaks functionality that was in Quicken 2000,"The user-friendly investment alerts mechanism that was in Quicken 2000 is completely destroyed. Someone should be fired over designing such a terrible interface.It now longer tracks investment in you security list unless you include them in your watchlist. Quicken also deviously attempts to upload all your portfolio information to their website.The alerts that you manually set get automatically reset (you have no choice in this) if the limits are met. This means that if you don't react upon the alert during the same session, you will have to remember the alert for a later session becauae Quicken no longer remembers it either - quite poor design.I wonder what they do with that personal data?"
1,Very disappointing,"I used earlier versions of QUICKEN for years. Putting in this version was a big mistake. Not only is it buggy (it has totally messed up previously reconciled entries), support is totally non-existant. Even trying to search the ""knowledge base"", on the support site, is a painful experience. The web site says not to expect an answer to reporting a problem. What type of support is that? I could do better manually than this version of the product."
3,"Very good pepper grinder, terrible salt shaker","As a pepper grinder it works perfectly, its very easy to adjust, but as a salt shaker its terrible. When you turn the mill upside down to shake the salt some pepper thats is stick to the grinder falls from the bottom. And its still very complex to put salt on it. Really Trudeau you should hire another designer. :) I'd recommend another model without the salt shaker."
4,great shaker/grinder,"Ok, I couldn't figure out how to open the salt compartment either. Had to find advice on this site. In spite of that, this is a really nice shaker/grinder for the money. Very smooth pepper grinding with good adjustment capability. Nice padded bottom so it sits down quietly and softly on the table. The salt flows very freely from the shaker - too freely for me in fact. I blocked 3 of the holes with clear glue, and now it's perfect. I think the design of the twist and lift salt compartment is odd, but now that I know how it works, I think it should be fine. I like this shaker/grinder and think it is a good value."
5,Love It but.....,"Love it, but hate to say that none of us in my family can figure out how to refill salt in top. Who would ever think to save the instructions to the salt/pepper grinder to be able to refill???? Anyone out there who buys one, if you can let me know that would be great! Other than that, we love the way the product looks, and love the way the pepper grinds!"
1,Too much trouble!,This is a good product- until the salt runs out. In order to use this product successfully one must:1. Own a computer and have an Internet connection (in order to do as I did and go online to Amazon so as to figure out how to refill the salt)2. Have a strong grip3. No joint issues (arthritis in the hands for instance)
1,Impossible to refill salt,"The product is beatiful, and it is very practical to have the salt and pepper in the same enclosure. However - refilling the salt can be mission impossible. It seems to me that the product was designed for its beauty and to be easily assembled, but nobody in Trudeau ever tried to open it.Do not buy this product unless you want to spend hours trying to refill the salt."
5,City Games book,The book has hard-to-find information on Industrial League games. I was delighted to find the content that I did and will be featuring the book in an August exhibit on Industrial Games.
2,Holds Your Interest But Very Predictable,"Par for the course with a Michael Plamer book, Miracle Cure will keep you reading. However, what is also becoming all too true is that Miracle Cure is another in the line of books written based on the ""Palmer formula"". If this is your first book by Palmer, you'll probably enjoy it a lot. But, having read all of Palmer's books,which have now become all to similar in terms of plot development and solution, I was pretty much able to guess the ending of Miracle Cure well in advance of getting there. While I enjoyed reading Miracle Cure, it is too predictable if you are an expereinced reader of Palmer's books."
4,A great thriller,"I give a 4 and not a 5 because even though it was my first time reading this novel, I felt as if I was watching a movie that I had already seen. The writing was wonderful, it was a page turner, and it kept me up all night because I did not want to put it down, however, I felt at time that I knew what was going to happen, and I was always right.In most cases that would annoy me, but Palmer is such a great artist, and writes in a way that keeps the reader glued to the book, that I did not care that I knew what was about to happen.A great, great read!"
1,Miracle Cure,"When I say I'm ""reading"" this book; I'm actually ""hearing"" it on audiotape while torturing my body on the treadmill. Finding audiotapes is difficult which is the only reason I'm continuing. If Audiotapes were easier to find, I'd pitch it in a heartbeat (pun intended).The book is a heavy dose of political propaganda--same old, same old, recycled villains: Republican Senator, drug companies, doctors trying to clean up. The heroes are just as predictable: struggling recovering addict MD, African-American Chief of Staff, wonderful Democratic president, regulatory government agencies protecting us from the evils of capitalism (wonder how much Palmer has squirreled away) in this case the head of the FDA. I don't like the protagonist -- a doctor who steals a drug he believes is beneficial is reprehensible and should be put in jail, not made a hero in a novel. Palmer is an MD; he should know better."
2,wimpy protagonist,"This book started off OK, albeit the whole premise was a bit of a stretch. Someone who is a cardiologist who lost his license over drug abuse would have no difficulty finding a better job than working at a carwash. Overlooking that, the first part of the book was relatively interesting. The protagonist, however, was such a stupid wimp that it was harder and harder to believe he could be a second year medical student, much less a cardiologist. He could pull off heroic medical exploits -- but was too stupid to come in out of the rain. By the end of the book I was hoping someone would just shoot him in the head -- he deserved it. Not worth a read in my opinion."
4,Great medical suspense!,After I read 'Side Effects' I was beginning to think that Michael Palmer had lost his touch. Then I read Miracle Cure and my opinion changed right away. This book was interesting right from the beginning. This book was rich with character detail and storyline and medical suspense. A must for any Michael Palmer fan.
5,I've read all of Palmers books except the new release!,"Yes - his books seem to following the typical formula/recipe for medical mystery thriller - BUT, each of the eight paperbacks of his books I finished in record time and couldn't get enough of them! After reading the first one ""Silent Treatment"" I ordered the other seven to read too! Yes, I too am fairly good at guessing the next ""thing"" that will occur in mystery books that I read - but I am pretty good at doing so with mystery movies and TV series too - so this is nothing new to me. I have to say that I have also passed on his books to friends and family to read and they are just as captivated by his writing ability and plots as I have been! They are a good, exciting, fast read and if that is what you are after you won't be disappointed - give his books a shot - I certainly did - and I'm not in the least bit disappointed that I did."
5,Excellant,This is the second time that I read this book and will read it again. It is full of suspense and intrigue. A definite read for anyone who enjoys medical thrillers.
5,Great Intrigue !!,"Michael Palmer has written a great suspense novel weaving the interpersonal turmoil of the main character beautifully with a captivating suspense thriller that will have you guessing at every turn. In the great style of Catherine Coulter and Robert Ludlum, Michael Palmer has written a terrific novel that ranks with the best of them. This is one you won't be able to put down until the end !"
4,"Same ol', same ol'","I have enjoyed all of Michael Palmer's books to date, but somehow this one just left me feeling like 'been there, done that'. IMHO this particular volume was put together like a Chinese menu: take this plot and this character and that bad guy and weave them all together into a story. Don't get me wrong, I did want to know how it all came out, but yet at the same time I DID know how it would all come out and who the bad guys were going to turn out to be. The only thing that caught me off guard was the method of the hoax. So while I was more or less enjoying reading the book, a part of me was saying ""You've read this before, why aren't you reading something different, something you HAVEN'T seen before?"""
3,Okay,"MIRACLE CURE is okay. Not the best thing Palmer has written. I would like to say that, if you like thrillers, I just read the best thriller I've read in years titled THE SHAPE: A NOVEL OF INTERNATIONAL SUSPENSE by Craig Furnas. It is about modern day Nazis, and secrets from the hero's family past come to haunt him...and a lot more. It is a totally thrilling read! It gripped me like a sumo wrestler and wouldn't let go until the last page!! That's how riveting it was. You can purchase the trade paperback on Amazon.com. Type in ""Craig Furnas"" in the search box, and read more about the book. Buy it. Read it. You'll love it. I'd rate it a 10+. Anyway, MIRACLE CURE ain't bad."
4,Caught me by surprise!,"Michael Palmer proves again that he is a top notch thriller writer. I find his novels extremely readable, and well written. These are sometimes mutually exclusive qualities of thriller fiction. He also does a good job in explaining the medical aspects of his novels. Knowing a bit about cardiology and related medical treatments, I was able to get past the jargon. I do wonder if a reader, with little or no previous knowledge of cardiology,would not get lost in the medical descriptions.Frankly, the resolution caught me by surprise, which was a pleasent surprise since many books of this genre are predicatble. But what was predictable was the ""bad guys."" Unfortunately, the were almost charecatures of themselves.I particularly enjoyed Epilogue II. This final wrap-up was unlike almost any other novel I've read. I won't reveal the twist, but all I can say is that when I read it, I said ""TOUCHE!"""
4,Delicious but terribly formulaic...,"I truly love Dr. Palmer's books, but his winning style is repeated novel after novel. Let me see if I get this right: A flawed hero doctor inadvertantly becomes embroiled in a hospital conspiracy that involves some of the Big Issues in modern medical ethics. He is wrongfully accused by his tormentors, finds himself at the precipice of losing everything, and is helped in his quest for The Truth by a beautiful woman who could be his savior or his nemesis. At the last moment, Truth and Love win out, the doctor is vindicated, and the medical community is saved from the evil machinations of the Conspiracy. Did I miss anything? But I still can't wait for the next installment..."
3,Interesting topic; uninteresting story!,"Why do I feel as if this story could have happened to Dr. Anybody in Anywhere General Hospital in Anytown USA? The topic of rushing an experimental ""miracle drug"" to market without adequate and meticulous testing is a timely one. However, this novel demonstrates a severe lack of depth in the character development and setting. It seems as if the plot was first constructed and, later, the characters and setting were added as an afterthought."
2,"A good, fast read -- definitely a page-turner.","Miracle Cure was a nice way to spend an afternoon, definitely a page-turner, in the quest to find out what's going to happen. The biggest fault I saw was believability: that the situation got as far as it did without anyone noticing anything was wrong with the drug or the test cases; that the hero just happened to be a cardiologist and just happened to get a job in time to get involved in the release of the medication. It was at best contrived. The end had a twist that I didn't suspect, but not enough redeem the faults in the plot. Generally good prose and dialogue; characters are developed minimally and are stereotypical."
4,FICTION PLUS PART AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL....?,"I've been Palmer's fan from the days of the ""sisterhood""....allllll of his books are great airplane books....but don't start at night unless you plan on reading all night long... this one seems to be quite autobiographical...ain't nothing wrong with that but the chenchen mafia.!..reallly, isn't that reaching just a bit....i think i liked his earlier books best but will continue to keep reading him but hopefully, his next book will have a bit more substance!!!!!"
3,"""Miracle Cure?"" Get a second opinion.","This book is like one of those amusement park rides where you are slowly elevated to the top and suddenly dropped hundreds of feet. And then it's over. The book HAS a good story. Too bad Palmer reveals it toward the end. If you've already bought it, stick it out, the ending is worth reading. If you haven't bought it, don't."
4,Hughes SD-HBH,"I got two of these receivers when I switced from cable to DirecTV Dec 3, 2004. So far I have not had any problems with either and now at 13 months later we are planning on expanding our system so I want to get two more along with a 2nd Tivo receiver."
1,this is the worst receiver ever!!!!!!!,"I have two of these receivers and I hate them. One of them died in one year, and I bought an rca receiver and it is much better. I will never buy something from hughes electronics ever again."
5,collection of great stories!,"I truly enjoyed reading these short stories and found all four of them highly entertaining. Amanda Ashley, Maggie Shayne, Sherrilyn Kenyon and Rhonda Thompson are all wonderful writers of paranormal romance."
3,Good read,"This was a good, easy read. The first story was okay, but not the best I have ever read. I really enjoyed the Kenyon story and the last one had to be my favorite by far. For some reason, I can't remember much about one of them, it must not have been that good.I recommend this one for light reading on a rainy weekend."
3,Anthology books,Some of the stories were ok. I enjoyed Sherrilyn Kenyons story more than the others.
2,I ripped up the book. . .,"and took out the stories by Sherrilyn Kenyon and Ronda Thompson. The others were so bad--and Ms Shayne's so preachy--that I couldnt keep it whole. I was offended by the inclusion of the Wiccan Reede to be read prior to the love story. I am a fan of Ms Shayne's other works especially her Twilight Series, but the story in this anthology left me cold."
3,"Not the Best, but still worth a read","I bought this for Kenyon story and I was not disappointed, what a great intro into the dream-hunters...I'm really looking forward to the first full length dreamhunter book in her darkhunter series. I really like Rhonda Thompson...I don't care what other reviewers say, if you like paranoral romance you'll love her stories. I think some reviewers are more partial to the paranormal and not the romance so maybe they don't enjoy it as much but I honestly loved the story. Amanda Ashley's was good but was missing something. I couldn't bring myself to finish the Maggie Shayne story it just didn't work for me."
4,Sherrilyn Kenyon REVIEW ONLY,I love Sherrilyn Kenyon and worship the ground she walks on with her book series. This was a good addition to the series. It is almost a stand alone but gives you more insight into the world of dream hunters. The story kind was thrown out there and was definitely a different step in the series but you learned more about the world and that is ultimately the goal of the books to give you a little bit more understanding and enjoyable read which it did.
3,A time waster!,"Lite, throwaway reading. 2 or 3 of the stories read like superficial fairy tales, and none of them show passion or intensity. Story plots and characters are mildly interesting, and blissfully short to finish. If you skip these tales you won't miss anything."
3,Spell Check,"The stories are good and the Authors are great. I am just having a hard time getting past all of the typos and mispelled words. I am reading the Kindle edition, so maybe it is just this version, but it is really distracting, and very unprofessional."
1,very disappointing leftovers (?),"This book was very disappointing. None of the stories had the pull to keep me remotely interested. All of them were too farfetched, to fast and written with no interest in development at all. It seemed rehearsed.Luckily I know that some of the authors have much better works out there - so I won't be totally disenchanted. But if you are looking for an anthology of PNR, go with ""The Magical Christmas Cat"" and ""Enchanted Season"". Much better."
3,Disappointing,"The Amanda Ashly & Maggie Shane stories weren't that disappointing because I don't expect a lot from them. Sherilyn Kenyon;however, I usually love except when she goes for porn which she unfortunately decided to do here. Ronda Thompson's story was too short. I was annoyed that this story, like her story in ""Love At First Bite"" fall into the middle of her ""Wild Wulfs"" series. Readers of that series will forever be missing two pieces of the family history unless they happen to stumble upon the missing links in the two anthologies. Not fair to her fans. If the publisher felt neither story was complete enough for its own book, why not combine them in a seperate small book or add one to book 2 and one to book 3 of the trilogy? Curse you, St. Martin's Press!"
4,Love Kenyon!,"""Phantom Lover,"" the novella by Sherrilyn Kenyon, is the best offering IMO in this anthology. It's about V'Aidan, a Dream-Hunter, who ""saves"" Erin from the Skotos dragon (among others) terrorizing her dreams. Lots of twists and turns in this one with a typically fabulous ending that I have come to love Kenyon for. If you're a Dark-Hunter/Dream-Hunter fan you'll enjoy this anthology just for her novella."
4,The happy organ ROCKS,Doing the Chicken Dance takes on new meaning after margaritas at Carlo's and Charlies in Cozumel. This song and album is awesome.
5,Wedding cake topper,"Saw this on a picture of a cake. Primed the ceramic, painted silver, and used as our wedding cake topper. It was fantastic and got a lot of compliments."
3,Good,"This is a good book. For me, a little hard to follow. I have read other books on influencing people which I liked better. The main reason I purchased this book was looking for ways to reach people with the Gospel. I have learned some new ways from this book."
3,not what expected,A little disappointed with this book i thought that it would be more of a guide- or help with lots of back up bible verses but it is more of a biography- i'm only 1/2 thru it- usually i can read anything but this one has been kinda hard to stick with- i would have rather just checked it out from the library then own it.
2,Nothing more than magic tricks and damnation,"This is the only Comfort book I have read. I had high hopes and was unpleasantly unsatisfied. There were no real new insights and techniques were scarce.I really gained nothing from the book. I have an unsettling feeling that he is one of those crazy preachers that stands on sidewalks and universities and scare the light out of everyone and yells at the ""homosexuals and fornicators"" and damns them to hell. And this is basically the exact technique he suggests in this book, after a few magic tricks to reel a crowd in. I wouldn't trust this pastor/nutjob. His fear-approach is not effective whatsoever, coming from an avid evangelist."
1,Cheap,Do not waste your money on buying these bracelets because you'll have to ship them right back. The beads were broken and beat up on a few of the bracelets. The bracelets were aso not tight meaning there was a ton of string and no beads to fill it up. I was shocked even for the price. Horrible quality and I ordered quite a few bracelets.
4,Have to love a PI with a PhD in English,"Tres Navarre is a PI in training that I want to read more about. He has good support too in his friend, Ralph (maybe a Latino Hawk?). I even liked Tres' Mother, and his cat. What I didn't like was tres having to take a 4-year old on surveillance. This was a job for which Tres' boss was getting paid, even though the 4-year old is adorable, this was too cutesy. The worst thing in the book is probably a minor detail to most people but it really bugged me. The fact that Tres is constantly being threatened with various punishments for working without a license. Mostly in ths book he is working for his friend, Milo, a lawyer. Unless Texas is different from most states, One does not need a PI license to investigate for a lawyer.But it is not clear that Milo is licensed in Texas. Anyway this is a minor glitz, if any, since surely Tres will have his license in the next book.... If you like PI's this one is pretty good."
2,Award winning?,"Riordan has created an interesting and original character in Tres Navarre, and I will trust other reviewers' claims that the local color--an important part of any private eye series--is right on the money; however, I find it difficult to believe that this book and its predecessor, Big Red Tequila, won awards for anything. The plots, as other reviewers have noted, are suspect at best, fouled by loose ends that never really get resolved. Many of the secondary characters blur together. Often Tres's motivation is difficult to fathom. And the dialogue is the weakest part of the series (if Ralph, Tres's Hispanic sidekick, said ""vato"" one more time, I was prepared to douse my paperback copy in gasoline and set it afire). Did this novel really enjoy the attention of a professional editor? I've read much better--how are these ""awards"" determined, anyway?"
4,Enjoyable Read,"Award-winning author who writes well with humor and great descriptions. First time read for this author, will definitely read additional titles in this series, like the protagonist, Tres Navarre - recommended !"
4,Keep Reading,"Although not nearly as good as the Last King of Texas, my first introduction to the series, The Widower's Two-Step was a good addition. I'm not usually a mystery/cop novel lover but Tres Navarre is a great character, and I've liked every book with him so far. Some other reviews said that there were too many characters to keep straight, but I don't agree at all. This is a series with reoccurring characters, and all of the non- reoccurring ones have an important role in the mystery. Another reviewer said that this isn't award material, and I won't begrudge someone their opinion, but perhaps these books are just not for everyone. I personally find them funny and smart. A PI with an English Phd who practices Tai Chi? Can't you see the humor in that?"
2,Tedious,Reminded me of a UT student on the 7 year plan. A great 200 page story that is told in 380 pages. Hope the next is better.
3,"good locally, mediocre globally","Rick is really strong in his representation of characters, situations, and scenes, and Tres is a very compelling protagonist. His representation of the San Antonio and Austin cultures is wonderful. However, the ""mystery"" part of this book is a bit weak. Still, it's a very worthwhile read, and I look forward to the softcover release of the third book in the series.Dan"
2,The Widower's Two-Step,"I've enjoyed Tres from his outing in ""Big Red Tequila"". The Widower's Two-Step left a lot to be desired. The murder in the beginning and the investigation was interesting but peters out. As the book progresses the story looses steam. It seems the editors rushed the ending and the book leaves a number of loose ends hanging. Hopefully The Last King of Texas will be the better go-round."
1,Worse than their first,"I cannot decide if I deserve a pat on the back for being willing to give the Baders' attempts at Austen a second chance, or a kick in the pants for being such a sucker. This second attempt compounds the problems of the first. If possible, it is clumsier than Desire and Duty, more plodding, and less readable. Superlatives all, but insufficient to explain the depth of dismal writing to which this nonsense sinks. It would not be such a crime, were the authors not attempting to tag their awful efforts on the saleability of Ms. Austen's name and talent. She cannot defend herself. Hopefully her discerning readers will not fall into the trap I did. I now have TWO books in 48 years that I have returned to a bookstore. How SAD!"
3,Sweet filler,"V&V is a sweet story, and an interesting follow-up to Desire & Duty. The ending is a bit recycled from D&D -- so it is predictable. But since there are no more works by Jane herself, this is a quick fix for a Jane junkie."
5,The Duke Boys,The movies were great. I had bought it as part of a Christmas present and he loved them. He has already watched both movies and plans to watch them again.
5,Awesome movies,Dukes in Hollywood have numerous enemies but still come out victorous.John Schneider finally sings a solo that is beautiful. He is very talented as a country singer. Reunion brings most of the players back to Hazzard to fight against a land takeover.
3,no chapters,"The menu on the CD has NO CHAPTERS, so you either watch the whole thing the entire way through, because if you stop, then you must fast forward to get to the spot you stopped at. Nice to see the characters together, but they do look OLD. Daisy is especially much heavier than on the series and Roscoe is creepy old. Boss Hog is dead in the first film and jessie is dead in the second, this makes the show seem morbid and depressing when they talk about it. There is too much of the characters, of new characters, and very little of the CAR which is the real star of the show. Most of the car jumps are recycled footage from the series, one jump was recycled from the series OPENING CREDITS...did they think we would not notice? Movie was a good idea, poorly executed, but better than the remake."
1,Dukes of Hazzard 2 movie collection,The product was not packaged as shown and not complete as shown. Only received the Hazzard in Hollywood movie and it came in a clear box. I am still waiting for the reunion movie and the Box that is shown with the description!!!!!!Very dissatisfied with my first transaction with Amazon.
5,The Real Dukes of Hazzard Movies!!!,Thanks again to Warner Bros for releasing these 2 movies. These movies should have been on the big screen!!! The DVDs will be a great addition to the rest of my Dukes collection or anyone else's really. Hopefully the Dukes cartoons and Enos will follow soon.
4,Dukes of Hazzard reunion movies.,"I watched the two Dukes of Hazzard movies (Reunion & Hazzard in Hollywood). Let me explain something. They were both good but the first one the Reunion to me in my honest opinion was the better of the two. It reunited the whole cast with the exception of Sorrell Booke (Boss Hogg); RIP dude, you are missed. It had its moments but at least the story took place in Hazzard County. The downside was that Denver Pyle (Uncle Jesse) had to wear a fat suit because he had lost a significant amount of weight. It had a story you could follow. I'd give the Dukes of Hazzard Reunion movie an 8/10. Hazzard in Hollywood wasn't that bad but with the passing of Denver Pyle after the first film it just lost its touch. It's good to put in the DVD player and see the remaining cast but it feels rushed with no value. I'd give Hazzard in Hollywood an 7/10, maybe I need to watch it more just to appreciate it as much as the Reunion."
4,1/2 A good set,"I had previously viewed ""Dukes of Hazzard: Reunion!"" and while it was cheesy, it was a good cheesy and fit with the original television series' feel and family warmthness. However, ""Hazzard in Hollywood"" was a movie we could all do without."
2,On my back: nearly asleep,"Although I respect On Our Backs, and read their sister magazine Girlfriends, this anthology just didn't do it for me. The stories were too short, and stopped whenever it got to the ""good stuff"". Erotica doesn't have to be pornographic, but at least finish the sex scenes!"
3,combo stone came apart at glue joint,"I like these stones, though like all water stones, they are quite soft, and require frequent flattening. The problem I had was that after soaking in water for awhile, my combination stone separated at the adhesive that held the two different grit stones together. They still work as two separate stones, but they are now each quite thin, and I don't expect to get as much life out of them. I wish I'd just purchased two separate water stones. You might also want to check out the Shapton stones. They are expensive, but are much harder than Norton or Japanese water stones, and so don't groove so quickly."
4,Great for straight razors,"I bought a new straight razor awhile back and was disappointed in its performance for its intended purpose, as it came sharpened from the factory it pulled more hair out of my face than it cut. So I decided to try and hone it myself with this Norton combo stone and it worked very well. The stone was very easy to use and put an extremely sharp edge on my razor with very little effort. The one downsize was that on the 8000 grit side there were a few little bumps on the surface of the stone that I had to grind down with some sandpaper before I could use the stone. But aside from that this was a great purchase for me and I would recommend it for anyone looking for an easy way to hone their straight razors."
2,Not satisfied,I received my stone today and upon inspection of my product I first realized that I received the 220/1000 grit combo instead of the 4000/8000 I had ordered. Looking at the price difference I payed an extra $30 for the wrong stone. Also the stone was chipped off at 3 of the 4 corners which I'm sure was from shipping. All in all I'm not satisfied with this purchase and now have to deal with the hassle of sending back this stone to receive the correct one and who knows what will come with that. I know mistakes happen but things like this show pure laziness.
2,I just can't recommend this product,"When people say this stone is not flat they are 100% correct. I thought I would be fine with it thinking, ""oh it can't be that bad"". Both sides are uniformly convex as if they are produced from the factory with about 1mm from peak to trough. You have to sand off 1mm of stone to flatten this sucker. If you're fine with this then go ahead and buy it because everything else works fine.The 8000 grit side produces a mirror finish on your blade but I haven't gotten the best results from the 4000 grit side which could be because I didn't flatten that side perfectly. Also, you can't sharpen your blades in the case/stand the stone comes with unless you cut off the top cover. The cover just sticks up too much and obstructs your movement across the stone.I recommend the King stones instead of the Norton stones but each stone has its disadvantages. If you're looking for the ideal stone you will need to spend more than $100."
4,Charges Motorola RAZR,"The charger does charge my RAZR - and the phone will say ""charge complete"" after a while. The problem is that the charge seems to only last about half as long as when I charge the same phone on my real Motorola brand travel charger. Not sure why... but for the price it is a great buy for a spare charger."
4,Food for thought & the soul,"Having read other Grisham books that are easy reading summer fare, I was surprised by the turn of the book midway through the story. It stopped being about law and lawyers. It became instead a journey of questioning and finally redemption for the main character. I found the book much more thought provoking than other Grisham books. And thus very pleasantly surprised. A must read for anyone going through their own mid-life or spirtual crisis."
2,A Biased View of Brazil,"This is the second Grisham book I read. It is an entertaining page-turner, but as a Brazilian, I was set back by Grisham's inaccurate, sensationalist and rather prejudiced portrait of Brazil. He makes ""Pantanal"", which is where most of the story takes place, seems like hell. Pantanal is the Portuguese word for swamp and it is also a beautiful ecological sanctuary. Okay, ""The Testament"" is fiction, but too much exaggeration makes the story loose credibility. I also thought that the end could have been better elaborated. He builds up a good suspense, but he lets the reader down in the end. If you are a big Grisham fan,the book is still worth reading despite its shortcomings. If not, I would recommend picking another book."
4,"A fast, entertaining read. Spiritualy uplifting.","I felt this was a great novel because of the fact the author included God is his plot. I enjoyed the missionary, her impact on Nate, and the peacefull ending of the book. I was able to read this book in a week. Being the slow reader that I am, books normally take me much longer than that to read. I was so into the characters, that I had to keep reading on. Forget going out to the movies, stay at home and read this book!"
4,Exquisite little parable,"This book proves that a best-seller doesn't have to be mindless. No one's going to confuse Grisham with Dostoevsky, but his readers don't want a story bogging down with too much profundity. He has just the right mix, the best mix of legitimate orthodox Christianity and literature since Walker Percy and Larry Woiwode."
2,If only 'The Testament' was exactly that...,"... but sadly I'm afraid Grisham (and his team) will go on churning out his particular brand of bland, unadventurous material until we all run out of money to buy it. As for the theme of this particular book - the evils of vast wealth, and how it really isn't THAT important - it seems very odd coming from a writer who, as much as any alive, has put his craft to the service of his bank balance. I got tired of the lecture and gave up well before the end."
3,"Good story, bad ending","I've been reading Grisham for a while now, I have most of his books at home but I can't agree with some other reviews on this pages that this is his best book ever.I did like the story, good build-up and he keeps you guessing (as usual) what's going to happen. But I do find the actual end a bit disappointing, I missed the kind of 'twist' most of his other books seem to end with..."
3,"Great voice, so-so plot","Here's my review system--I score on four categories and average them together for the number of stars. The four categories are: character development (are the characters deep and complex, plot (is it interesting), voice (is the narration smooth and engaging) and cliche level (is it predictable.)Characters: 5 stars-- I found the two main characters fascinatingPlot: 2 stars-- it went on an on to a predictable endingVoice: 5 stars -- very smooth which I believe is Grisham's strong suitCliche: 3 stars -- good lawyers and greedy lawyers as JG doesOverall Score 3 stars"
3,Not quite typical Grisham,"A millionaire dies leaving his ethically-challenged children and grandchildren with only enough to pay off past debts and leaves the rest to an illegitimate child who is apparently in the Brazilian jungle.A recovering alcoholic is sent to seek her out and have her sign the appropriate paperwork. He learns some life lessons of his own in his search for her.This book slightly departs from his typical legal thrillers. The book addresses at least somewhat greed, ethics, and religion. I would recommend this book to anyone."
5,My favorite Grisham novel I've read so far,"I enjoyed it from the start to finish. Get's your attention right away, and has a good ending, unlike some of his novels."
5,Grishen does it again.,"Wonderful. Truly a a book to keep your interest throughout. If I could have, I would have read it straight through."
4,Typical John Grisham,I love his characters. He has a way of redeeming a tarnished soul. The plot for this one is again excellent.
5,Grisham's Testament,Loved it. Hard to put it down. Sequencing of events is fun and keeps your attention and anxiety to find out what happens next. Very cleverly written.
3,A Mixed Bag,"This book has two distinct personalities: one is a well written, fascinating account of traveling down a river far from civilization to find someone a la Heart of Darkness. However, the second is a tedious, stereotypical account of greedy, badly behaved heirs with greedy, badly behaved lawyers who are contesting a will. I was captivated by the former and bored by the latter. Definitely a mixed bag. The end was also strangely unsatisfying. I wish it had been consistently good!"
3,Very familiar,"Typical Grisham, ok read, but dull ending. Found a better book in the bargin bin by Tom Topar called ""The Codicil"", which is suprisingly similar. In fact, almost too similar, I wonder if Grisham read the same book before writing The Testament??? If I were Topar, I would look into it."
2,I LOVE ALL JOHN GRISHAM BOOKS BUT THIS ONE,"JOHN GRISHAM BOOKS ARE MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE. I HAVE READ EACH AND EVERYONE. I HAVE FOUND HIS LAST TWO BOOKS, THIS ONE ESPECIALLY TO BE FLUFF. WHERE IS THE USUAL GRISHAM SUSPENSE AND PLOT TURNS? I KNOW I'LL GO ON READING HIS NOVELS BUT I WANT MORE ACTION, BETTER CHARACTERS AND FOR GODSAKE MUCH BETTER ENDINGS."
4,Great Book not so great ending,"The characters are great, the story is tremend, everything seems perfect, but I expected a more controversy ending from Grisham.. anyway a great book , READ IT."
2,"""The Testament"" is quite a disappointment.","I have to admit that I'm a big Grisham fan. But ""The Testament"" is a big disappointment. I found myself turning the pages for the sake of finishing the book (having already bought it). It started out promisingly enough, but as the story progressed, it slowly borders on silliness. Imagine a multi-million dollar law firm sending a drunk into a South-American jungle on a case that could potentailly be worth millions-very clever... If you absolutely must have this book in your Grisham collection, wait for the paperback. Otherwise, wait and hope that his next wouldn't be so bad."
4,"It almost had me, but..............","the ending is weak. This novel, like many by Grisham, is very good and difficult to put down. (Or turn off in my case) However, when the story ends, you'll find yourself saying, ""Is that it?"" I don't want to give anything away, but I will say the book is definitely worth your time."
5,Best of Grisham,"Finally, Grisham has redeemed himself, and written a book to the caliber of The Firm and Time to Kill. This is a must read, full of excitement, but gives great insight into life on the mission field, while keeping modern day interest with the other ""heirs"" of the estate."
2,"Appreciate the effort, but needs more maturity","I can appreciate Grisham's attempt to break out of his usual genre with ""The Testament,"" and the story is not without its charms. As usual, Grisham's writing style kept me hooked from the beginning, but by the end I couldn't figure out why.The problem is this: Grisham seems to not have the sophistication to fully describe the lead character's fight with drug and alcohol dependance. That tension is the lynchpin of the novel, and I didn't feel it.Though the sections in the jungles of Brazil were well-writen, the descriptions only served to divert the real focus of the book - Nate's fight to stay alive and, in the process, find himself.I just kept thinking: A man's salvation has more depth than this. Doesn't it?And by the way, if you were looking for a legal thriller stop right now. This isn't one."
1,Seriously?,"I listened to this book toward the end of a long, long drive. It had me captivated and alert right up until the last mile. Then I listened to the end of it the next day on my way to work. Are you kidding me? I've never felt so cheated in my life! Try writing the ending again, please! It's like he got to the green in two strokes then decided not to putt. I want my six hours back. With interest."
1,Grisham gets a F on this one.,"The book was very unrealistic. The main character, a drunk lawyer, is unable to solve his drinking problem by the use of spiritual principles suggested in 12 step programs; however, he solves his problem by merely accepting some trite religious dogma which has consistently failed to work with drunks.Do your research John!"
1,Very disappointing,"I was really disappointed - none of the trademark Grisham character development, courtroom drama or story development. Don't bother with this one - save your money."
1,A major disapointment,"This book was a thorough waste of time. Not only did it not have the pull of Grisham's other books, it appears that the author simply bored of writing it and hastily procurred a lame ending.Spend your money elsewhere."
4,I Recommend it,"This is the first Grisham book I've read. I picked it up out of curiosity after seeing a review in the newspaper.A good, easy read with a point to it. I enjoyed the descriptive material. Enjoyed the legal characters.Think about the ending."
3,"Yes Virginia, there really are good lawyers","I had serious hopes for this new Grisham. The beginning was quite good, obnoxious billionaire with Jerry Springeresque family, dies with secret will to be unfolded. Total burn out rehab veteran is sent on a wild goose chase to anaconda country after the mystery heiress. Can't go wrong? Oh yes it can. The pages about the ghastly family members seeking the inheritance are hysterically and frighteningly funny (Grisham obviously knows that people turn into werewolves when they are mentioned in a will) I wish he had centered more on that, the rehabbed lawyer has moments of interest but bottoms out and the heiress is totally unrealistic. John Grisham simply does not and never will get women's characters. Too bad. It started out well. Time for another Robert Tanenbaum!"
3,Why am I reading a Movie???,"Why is it that all new books by popular authors are written as screenplays? While the format is not of a screen play, this new books is bound to show up on the screen. I am really tired of my favorite authors writing simply for the money and a possible movie deal. While I enjoyed the book, the story was too far fetched to get into. The heirs are taken from the movie ""Greedy"", and the idea that Phelens leaves all his money to some unknown illegit daughter in brazil, is just too much! This book was written for one reason - To make a movie out of it. Grisham is not the only guilty one here, Clancy, King & Barker have fallen into the same rut with their new books too."
2,Did anyone edit this?,"As I read this latest Grisham product, I kept wondering whether it was something he'd written in high school and come across while cleaning out the attic. The plot meanders, the characters are very thin and dull (the missionary chick is a dolt). Clearly no one read this book prior to publication, including probably Grisham. Just set it and forget it; crank out a few hundred thou. This would have been rejected by my high school English teacher. It contains numerous misspellings, continuity errors, and repetitions (how many times must we be read that Nate threw up in the shower -- often inducing it himself to get it over with?) It is very annoying to pay $20 bucks for a book (at Safeway) and be unable to read it without being jerked around at every turn by the intrusion of piddly-ass and irritating errors. Forget it! Not worth the trouble."
2,Disappointing,"For a law-thriller the book has no action, no legal questions. no real characters.Grisham is not delivering the goods."
2,Disappointing,"Not up to Grisham's earlier efforts. None of the usual plot intricacies which have marked his other books. The main character was interesting but neither he nor any of the others were as developed as I would have liked. I felt the book ""stopped"" rather than ended. Very unsatisfying."
2,Very disappointing after a great beginning,This book is not up to Mr Grisham's usual high standard. It gets bogged down in irrelevant details about a particularly unpleasant family on the one hand and geographical descriptions that are not Mr Grisham's forte.
2,Sophomoric,"Exceedingly thin plot containing exceedingly thin characters, and a writing style that would shame a community college english student. Grisham had better go back to practicing law - maybe it will give him some fresh insights."
2,Good story line but predictable plot,"I am a Grisham fan and I was dissappointed with the predictable plot and the lack of depth in the characters described. A good basic story line, but I was expecting more."
2,dis-a-POINT-ed!!!!,"Read all the others & enjoyed. This one did not have much suspense and very little of the legal details and thrills of his previous books. Characters were interesting, but then he didn't do much with them--the relationship between Nate and Rachel was so shortlived and flimsy that the rest that followed just wasn't believable. Early in the book, so much emphasis was placed on Troy's genius and his desire to outwit his despised relatives (even from the grave), that throughout the entire book I kept waiting for some surprise to be revealed in relation to the will/testament, for Troy to somehow win/outsmart them all. Not much substance, though as always, well written. I'm sure he'll get millions for the movie rights, but I sure won't be shelling out for a ticket to this one"
2,Dull and slow movng,"I have to say that I'm very disappointed with this book, it moved much to slow and I just didn't enjoy it like I have the rest of John's books. I'm anxiously awaiting John's next novel and hope it is better than this one was."
2,Rather dry...,"This book started with a lot of promise, and then went down hill from there. I kept expecting something good to happen but was sorely disappointed. The only reason I finished it is because it was in audio version which meant I didn't have to force myself to turn a page. Better luck next time..."
2,A big disappointment.,"I ignored a negative customer review of this book when I should have paid attention. I stayed up half the night to finish the book--only to be done with it, not because it was that interesting. A big disappointment coming from John Grisham. The characters were boring, the plot was not believable by any stretch of the imagination. I found it a waste of my money and time. All Grisham's previous books, with the possible exception of THE PELICAN BRIEF, were fascinating, very readable. This one was just too far fetched. Perhaps the author needs a vacation. He's too good a writer for this book."
1,This book was the worst he has written.,"I have read all the Grisham books and this one was the worst. The story is long and drawn out and the ending was so predictable. I am a well read person who has enjoyed all of the Grisham novels, but this one was very dissappointing. There was not enough action and intrigue to keep me interested. I had to force myself to finish it, which I have never had to do with his books. I am very glad that I didn't buy the book, just borrowed it from the library."
1,insulting at the very least,"not having read all of grishman's books, this one by far was cut and pasted together for really no apparent reason. ch. one was an excellent attention getter but the rest of the story was a mere extension, lacking depth, and real character analysis. One recommendation to grisham: please don't insult our intelligence by creating illusionary plots followed by insignificant description. Any intelligible author would have seen this coming. save your time and money."
1,Grisham bore!!!!,"The worst,most boring book I`ve read in years.I don`t know why this book was even published.No story,no plot,no ending.Save your money.It`s a shame that trees were cut down to make this ""book"""
5,Currently the best in the genre !!!,"Grisham has become the best known American writer in Russia. This story is truly his best in years. Captivating plot, a keen insight into the legal system. Gripping, absorbing, thrilling, unputdownable ! A must for any Grisham fan, and a cool chance to become one for the uninitiated readers."
4,Realism Sense,"I like this John Grisham's newest book, and give it 4 stars. Like his anothers book, Grisham showed a realism sense again. It's sense, however, always bring the readers to flow in his story, and drive us to ask ""what more happens?"" But sometimes I asked my self, why Grisham always write a law story? If he write another genre, I think - with his realism sense - he can build more greateful tales. Like we ever know, in A Time to Kill, Grisham explored the facts so realism. It continued in his coming books, expecialy in my oppinion is the best, The Testament. More, he bring us to the world of laws, lawyers, and firms. No just a story, but it was like an encyclopedia of laws. Grisham self, like a prof. in his jobs. In other word, 4 stras are enough for him."
5,Another Grisham Winner,"You can't but help just loving Grisham's accurate legal and law accounts on books, that's why his fictions feel like biographies instead of what they're made to be. The Testament falls under the same lines of what the author does best: reality. Though this book wasn't as great as his widely acclaimed The Firm, it's just as intense and creative."
3,Nice book but ......,"Gripping - disappointed at the end - almost an anticlimax. A great storyline for 90% of the book. The ending was very disappointing ,as if John Grisham had a dateline and had to meet it.Overall however, there was fantastic insight once again into the legal world for which laypersons have no real understanding."
2,Could have been shorter,This book could have been 125 pages shorter. The middle chapters seem to be self-indulgent. Sharing with the reader the excruciating details of the undeveloped portions of South America - as if he just came back from an expedition and wanted to share everything that happened. The overall concept was interesting. I just skimmed through the chapters describing the landscape and inhabitants in order to get on with the story.
3,Do We Have to Wait for the Sequel to Learn the Ending?,"Grisham strecthes his writing muscles by leaving behind his familiar Southern courtroom and takes the reader on a trip to Brazil. An eccentric billionaire looking to die, a burnt-out litigator just out of rehab and a woman who left the modern world to work in Brazil are all brought together by the secret of the Testament. Promising start leads to entertaining content, which turns down a dead-end street. I think the conclusion of this book (or lack thereof) could have been better thought out."
3,Not Grishams best book,"Although the idea of the book may seem intriguing, it comes out like another Biggles episode. Grisham is a great writer, no doubt about it, but...he just doesn't reach the same quality level as some of his previous work in this one. It might not be as good as ""The partner"" or ""The firm"", but if you're a fan of J.G it's a couple of hours of amusement, a good supplement to the TV anyhow."
3,The Testament,"The Testament starts off real good,but seems to go down hill from there. Its almost as if he started off writing one story,then changed his mind halfway through.He doesnt develop enough of his charactors,as soon as you get into one charactor the book completely changes pace,and turns into an almost completely different story. His other books are much better (The Runaway Jury, Pelican Brief, The Firm)."
4,The Testament,"The testament by John Grishman is very interesting because at the beginning when Troy Phelans a multi -billionaire falls off a building and commits suicide, and he makes this will called the testament. It is very fascinating when Nat O Riley a person that they hired to take a plane to the Brazillan Jungle in South America. While Nat is in the Brazillan Jungle he is looking for a missionary named Rachel Lane who has inherited billions of dollars from Troy Phelan. When he gets to Brazil he has a bunch of problems with the heirs. Excitement occurs when he goes to South America and he gets into alot of trouble; he gets lost out in the wilderness of South America, and he can't find Rachel Lane anywhere. The Testament was a book I could'nt put it down because it was so exciting, and the book is very fascinating and very good."
1,What has happened to the John Grisham I knew?,"Not even close to his other books. What a disappointment. It looks like John has fallen into the trap of pumping out books in record time (probably due in part to his contract with the publisher) and resting on past laurels to sell them. Thank heaven I borrowed this one. It's a shame to forsake one's principles and talent for the almighty buck. Please John, give us some of the mystery, intrigue, and intellectualism of your earlier work."
1,shockingly poor written book,"Contrasting to the books written before by John Grisham (I read them all), this book is of such a poor quality, i.e. lack of plot, lack of suspension, lack of thrill and lack of vivid characters. I definitely think the media has built up too much expectations for readers prior to the publication of the book. It does not derserve. Sadly, it seems to me that the book was written in a such rush, with no literacy values. it is a pure commercial book, meant to make a quick buck, rather than to entertain readers. I was very disappointed and will have a second thought on whether or not to buy/read his next book."
1,SUCKS,"I am disappointed that John Grisham could keep me so captivated with others like ""A Time to Kill"" and leave me so uninterested with this one. Has he given up? No suspense...no character development...YUCK!"
3,Where was the surprise ending?,"I bought The Testament December 30 and was finished by noon on the 31st. It began quickly and captured my attention within the first two chapters. I was enthralled until the last part of the book then I was deeply disappointed in the finish. Mr. Grisham has done this before, left the story hanging and a lot of unanswered questions (such as in The Client and The Firm). I really was hoping for an ending like The Partner, where there was definitely a surprise. I was disappointed that the lawyers actually got their money from the heirs, and the fact the heirs got any money at all. I will get his next book from the library and save myself some cash."
3,"Excellent beginning, the jungle tiring as real","I enjoyed everything associated with court or lawyers' actions - sure, Grisham is good at it, but it's not the main plot. Indoor actions and descriptions perfect, much better then the outdoor ones, I prefer J. F. Cooper's description of nature. I would expect something more."
4,Whats not to like?!,"Its not every day you read a book that mixes legal suspense with the dangerous surrounds of a Brazilian jungle!I think this really is an excellent book.Everything seems to be a surprise.I dont see why people seem to think the end to this book is unthought of because i thought it was quite a good idea, something unpredictible.I think this is one of the best books John has wrote,and i hvae read all of them.Definitely buy it!"
2,"Lost is the ""quagmire"" of the jungle!","Starts out well but soon gets lost in a lengthy and seeminly never ending description of a trip to find a missionary in a remote part of the Brazilian jungle. Aside from the story of a very dysfunctional family who are heirs to their fathers billions (which he wills to his illegitimate daughter...the missionary) and ensuing fight for the money is the dysfunctional lawyer, who fights his own demons and somehow manages, it seems, to have a ""spiritual awakening."" The story does not pick up again until the last chapters and then in short measure seems to finish off leaving one wanting something more. This story was definitely lacking something for me."
2,The Testament,"I was Very DISAPPOINTED in this book. I keep reading it hoping it would have a great surprise ending, but nothing. Would not recommond this book at all."
2,watch the movie,"The Testament was not one of John Grisham's best works. I found myself putting down the book numerous times. There was a great story line, but there was minimal character development. I had a hard time relating to them because of their shallowness. The novel drags too much to have hooked me. All in all, I think The Testament was poorly written compared to The Chamber and A Time to Kill. Watch the movie"
2,"Boring, Boring, Boring!!!","I own and have read all 11 books by John and personally feel this was far from his usual standard.Perhaps the pace of a book a year, ala Danielle Steel is too much for many writers -- even a great one like John Grisham. I have read a lot of criticism regarding ""The Brethern"", however I enjoyed it much, much better than ""The Testament""."
3,Maybe It is not the best book of Grisham,"I think there is the fool woman in story,she is too infantility, the lawyer who look for her is fool too."
4,Drifts you into Brazil,"Needless to say, John Grisham is very popular even here in Japan, too. As a non-native speaker of English, I'm a fan of his masterpieces. The elements of the adventures in this book made me foget to have a lunch break. The ending of the story is what you might expect to happen."
2,Quite a disappointment,"Decent plot and a change from Grisham's ususal formula, but very disappointing. Too much rambling on and on about characters that he does not make us care about. Very little dialoge between characters and a very uninteresting sub plot. Makes us wait to the last twenty pages for a glimpse of some excitement only to be let down by an abrupt and uninteresting ending. If your looking for mystery, intrigue and juicy characters this book will be a bitter disappointment."
4,It's a decent read.....,"The book started off very quickly. The first night, I read about 100 pages without stopping.... However, the story slowed down. It was still very interesting, but there was a lot of information that really had no relevance to the underlying plot. The end of the story was predictable. Thankfully, the final part of the book was only 25 pages long and ended swiftly. As with nearly all of his books though, it is worth the read. I recommend it."
2,Competent writing style but dull as ditch water,"John Grisham is master of the fast paced, all action thriller, or so I thought. But somewhere among the line he has undergone a transformation. Starting with 'The Street Lawyer' he became pedestrian. Why does he now insist on writing books with non-existent plots? I thought it might just be a one off, but with 'The Testament' it has become a regular feature. In his defense he is a competent writer and the opening of this book is impressive. It's just that after the opening, it falls off a cliff.Please, Mr Grisham, if you read this, address the problem."
5,AWESOMELY SPIRTUAL!,"I think it is wonderful when authors write about God in their books, it is wonderful witnessing when I popular author such of John Grisham write about God, and so many people read it and learn a little more about our Father. I pray that many learned from this book, and that many were brought into the Lord's loving arms of forgiveness. I pray that John Grisham will continue to write great books. Love Becca G'bye & God Bless"
3,Good but not his best,"This book is worth reading but I feel that it isn't his best writting he has done. The plot just doesn't seem to be as catching as ""The Chamber"". For any Grisham fans I would suggest this book but Mr. Grisham please write another book don't let us remember you with this book."
3,Bad editing,"This was the first Grisham novel I read - I haven't even seen the movies. The plot was good, the locale interesting, and the ending was excellent. I'm also glad that Grisham didn't butcher or put down Christianity. That's a rare thing these days.However, there were some areas that should've been cleaned up by his editor; he repeated details, as if he'd forgotten that he'd already mentioned them, and some of the writing was sloppy. I was surprised that the editor didn't make sure that the writing was ""tight."" I thought famous authors have the best editors because the publishing houses are willing to pay for all that.I'm glad that this book has done well, but wonder if the publishing house is just pushing it through because he's incredibly successful, and they trust his track record thus far."
3,A departure from traditional Grisham novels,"When I picked up the book, I thought ""Oh, boy! A good weekend read"" I was excited to get started and get into it...and it was good, just not typical Grisham. I was looking for the twist at the end, where someone turns up with a key file or a key witness or a key something else that the plot pivots on and that trademarks Grisham novels. But I think the author is evolving abit. (And don't we all change!?) Even Street Lawyer had the departure from the pursuit of $$$...and so did this one. I liked the switch, it just wasn't what I expected."
2,Not up to Grisham standards,This is the first John Grisham book that I have read that I did not enjoy. It was easy to read but the story left me flat. John needs to get back to what he does best and write about complex legal issues woven within an intricate plot.
4,Another book with predictable characters....big suprise,"The characters always wind up doing the same thing, and thats when any success comes into view, they avoid it. It's all to familiar if u have read his other books. Still it's pretty good,"
3,"Straight out of the gate, and right into the stable.","Like a racehorse, this novel began at a fast and furious pace. Grisham wove a tale of intrigue, fame and fortune, all the while tempting the reader to probe further into the lives of the self destructive, yet addicting characters. As you read further however, the characters grew predictable and were not nearly as shocking as you were originally led to believe. The exotic locale's that at first tantalized the imagination, began to fade as the book wore on. In the end, the story moved to a slow clip-clop pace. Wanting to believe that there would be an incredibly explosive ending, didn't make it happen. Into the stable it went, along with my interest."
5,Great read,Wonderful twists that can't help but leaving the reader fulfilled. I would recommend to all who feel they have none.
2,so so. story ends before it really began,"I'd rate this story in grisham's bottom 20%. Reminds me a little of The Broker (italy that time, not the amazon), but without anybody trying to kill anybody.Long winded alcoholic redemption story, shallow characters fighting over an inheritance and little else."
4,What can I say...,"John Grisham books are the Denny's restaurants of the literary world...you always know what you are going to get! That's not necessarily a bad thing though. I enjoyed the quick, no brainer read that The Testament provided. (It was almost as easy as watching television). It's a good, sturdy read to pass the time between more strenous selections."
3,Entertaining - But No Real Story!,"When I started to read The Testament, I initially found it to be a funny, witty and quite entertaining story - greedy wanna-be heirs and lawyers, and the tricks they play on each other, a merciless look at mercenaries! I found myself laughing out loud at several occasions!However, the more pages I turned, the more I began missing a real storyline. The character of the missionary turned heiress is quite undeveloped - she's simply ""too good to be true"". And the desillusioned lawyer with his addiction to alcohol only convinces in his initial role as a relentless sarcastic. When he progresses to insight and sobriety, he becomes boring and implausible.At the end I found myself asking: Oooookay...?""It seems that Grisham thoroughly ran out of steam halfway through this one. Hope the next one will be better!"
4,A message worth sharing.,"The Testament has so many wonderful messages for the reader. I think the most important is that it exposes the narccistic attitude of so many adults and elevates the individual who consciously puts the rat-race behind him/her and reaches out to help their fellow man. Too many parents are guilty of putting the aquisition of material goods and power ahead of what's important. Namely, spending time with their children and raising them with integrity and character. To hell with self-esteem. How about character? John Grisham does a great job of weaving this message through his novel. The description of the Brazilian back country was superb. I enjoyed it immensely."
4,One of Grisham's Best,"This book almost kept me as interested as ""A Time to Kill"" and ""The Firm"". I'm pleased that it seems as though Grisham has regained his form. Of course this book folowed the same course as most of his books - fast beginning, slowing down to describe intricasies, and an interesting, if not, surprising end. Definitely recommendable. I wonder when it will be in the theatres!"
5,The Testament got to be my favorite book.,"This book captivates your imagination from the very first pages to the final pages that you read. This book is my favorite of all books that I read because I didn't have to finish the book to like it. You can read as much as you want and then, leave it to your imagination to finish it. I found I slept better and my ears transcend with nice thoughts as I try to figure out my own version as to how the story ends."
2,Grisham finally gets away from Southern USA,"Finally Grisham writes a novel that is based elsewhere, in this case Washington and Brasil. The storyline is interesting - excentric spiteful billionaire wanting revenge one last time on his ungrateful children and ex-wives. However, there is a lack of tension in this story, which seems to end a little too easily and with apparently no conflict. The winning side in this case is clear right from the start. The story has some interesting elements to it, but I found it overall disappointing in the end."
3,Catchy and Uplifting,"I think John did a tremendous job in relating real life to story. Its true that not all heros are that perfect.In his book, Nate is such an example, a man who has an alcoholic problem and made a mess of his own life.His book is also entertaining and is really a page flipper. His vivid description of the scene in the jungles of Brazil also illustrates that Mr John Grishman had indeed does him homework. Bravo!"
3,The Testament,"I was very pleased with this effort by Grisham. His books are rarely a ""deep"" read, but are fun and engaging. The Testament fills this profile well. Good escapist reading... hard to put down.. a couple days and late nights of entertainment."
5,"Very Compelling, I had to read every page.",I have read many of John Grishams books and this is the best one that i have read. With a very compelling story it lures you to read the whole thing and not want to put it down.
5,This Book is Great! Got me hooked on Grisham!,The Testament was my first Grisham book that I have read. I was pleasantly surprised. My only criticism about the book was that the greedy relatives got too much! They deserved nothing. Reading about the greedy children was the most entertaining part. It was also nice to see the hero have some standard human flaws - so unlike heros in most books. Would definitely recommend!
3,Fine if you're stuck in an airport,"I've heard so much about Grisham books that while I was stuck in an airport for 9 hours, I bought The Testament. In my situation, the book was fine. It wasn't the worst thing I've read. The story does move quickly at first, but then it slows down to a snails pace and not much worthwhile is going on. This is not the type of book I expected. I thought Grisham books teach a little about the law while engaging the reader in a page-turning tale. I learned nothing from this one. Not what I expected."
2,Disappointment,"I'm disappointed. I finished reading The Testament about twenty minutes ago, and I'm still waiting for it to get interesting. I've read all of his other novels to date, and this one is the dullest. A Time To Kill and The Chamber were simply amazing...The Runaway Jury was incredible until the very end (could have had a much better finale, in my opinion)...but The Testament was simply disappointing as a novel coming from Grisham."
4,Historical source,"I rate 4 stars because I haven't finished the book yet. My comment has to do with source material: Is it possible that the names ""Nate"" and ""Rachel"" are taken from members of the team of missionaries serving the Aucas in Ecuador (with Mission Aviation Fellowship) when 5 of the men were attacked and killed in January of 1956? Nate Saint was one of the dead. Rachel Saint,his sister, and one of the widows moved to the region and lived with the Aucas for many, many years.Mr. Gresham,if you pick up this comment, I would dearly love a response. Testament brought back many memories of that true story. Thank you for reminding me of their sacrifice......................"
2,Tell me more...Tell me more...,"This is the first John Grisham book I have read. I am sure there are diehard fans out there who say I should start with The Firm or something. The point is that this is as descripitive as Dick And Jane. I feel nothing for any of these characters, and what could be entertaining scenes skip by in three sentences. He doesn't bring you into the story. He just lets you look at it like a fish in a fishbowl. And just as entertaining.The first Chapter pulls you in to the possibilities of the outcome, but after that it's just a simple mindless read. He is definitely a writer second and a lawyer first."
2,Not one of his best!,"I've always enjoyed John's books but this one definitely falls short. In fact I wasnt even half way through I quit reading. I can't remember the last book I didn't finished,even if it was bad! This one was too slow,boring and repetitive."
5,My first Grisham experience was not a disappointment,"I simply loved this novel. I had never read Grisham before, but now I believe his books will make their way into my library. The plot was great and the characters unforgettable. I don't want to say too much or I'll give away the story, but I wanted to send my congratulations to John Grisham for writing a story with Christian values and principles in it. People will not like him for this. Some of you reading this review are thinking that you will never read one of his books again. Well, Mr. Grisham, you may suffer here on earth, but your reward is great in Heaven. Keep up the good work."
3,A great summer read!,"I have read all Grisham's novels. This is not the best but worth buying and reading. An adventure story with ""lawyer humor"" as only Grisham can write. The ending was surprising - Grisham has courage to end it this way. Not the typical ""Hollywood ending."""
2,By far the worst Grisham yet.,"A fascinating beginning that drops off into what appears to be Grisham's effort to show the world that he's been to South America and has an eye for detail. There are some very interesting parts to this book, but overall, very disappointing for this Grisham fan."
4,A great picture of the lives around us,Troy Phelan was a very wealthy man. He had six children from the results of his four marriages. He writes his last testament minutes before his suicide. His testament was read months later and it shook everyone because more than half of his wealth was given to an unknown heir of him whom he wrote was his daughter. Nate O'Riley is a Washington litigator and he gets hired to go and find the unknown heir in the deepest vallies of Brazil and beside the highset mountains of Bolivia among a group of Indians as a World Tribe Missionary. It takes you to the wildest places to find the truth about this man's (Troy Phelan) TESTAMENT.
1,"This book and ""The Chamber"" are Grisham's least likeable","I've read each of his books, liked all of them except for The Chamber. This is the worst of his books. I kept reading with the hope that it would get better. The plot in unbelievable, there is MUCH TOO MUCH monotonous writing about riding on the river in the jungle, then the end cuts off quickly and doesn't really make much sense. I will be more cautious before buying another one of his novels and am looking for another favorite author."
1,Formulaic Work Designed for Hollywood,"Grisham, like Clancy, now churns out formulaic novellas that are pumped up with predictable big plot twists that Hollywood would like. There are no heroes in this novel, just a bunch of greedy idiots and third-world bumpkins treated with equal indifference by Grisham. If this book was written by an unknown author, it will be rejected by almost all publishers, due to lack of merit. However, Grisham is now internationally famous, so he can sit back, relax, and churn out knock-off of his earlier and best efforts."
1,I would have given it 0 stars if I could...,"This is perhaps the worst legal thriller I have ever read. I enjoyed Runaway Jury & Rainmaker, so I have liked some of Grisham's previous efforts, but this has to be the 1) lamest, 2) laziest, 3) most boring, 4) most sodden ending (yes, sodden is the perfect word) effort I have ssen by a major writer in a long time. Grisham should retire. This novel would not have been published without his name on it."
2,Disappointing,"I found this book to be the most disappointing of all the Grisham novels to date ( I am told THE CHAMBER was forgettable, but that is the one I have not read.) The trademark climactic courtroom scenes are absent except for some minor interesting depositions. The character development for all of the Phelan children is quite lacking. The ending was very anticlimactic. All in all, nowhere near his classics i.e. A Time to Kill or The Runaway Jury."
1,Don't buy if...,"I love to read, but yet I was extremely unsatisfied with this book. It was the worst book I ever read. It was quite boring, no action worth reading, and based on money. If you really like legal stuff and money based books then this book is for you. But if you are in for a good read, thrill, and action, don't buy and waste your money."
2,"Not his best work, but...","...finally Grisham writes a novel that is based outside the southern USA, in this case Washington and Brasil.The storyline is interesting - excentric spiteful billionaire wanting revenge one last time on his ungrateful children and ex-wives. However, I found that there was a lack of tension in this story right through to to ending.The story has some interesting elements to it, but I found it overall disappointing in the end."
1,Watch The Movie,"I'd heard the Grisham name so often, in book stores and movies I'd seen. The books premise was interesting I decided to take the plunge and bought this one. The characters are shallow and poorly developed. It is written at the level of a talented, wordy elementary school student. Grisham is the exception that proves the rule ""The book is always better than the movie."" Wait for the movie. It will probably be better. A decent cast can help flesh out the characters."
3,First Grisham book that I read and finished,"This is the first Grisham book that I read and finished...I would have to give it 3 stars...it was not bad by any means, but the book promised a surprise with the character of Rachel, and there was none. The only surprise is when she died at the end. There was a part of me that wanted to ask, is she really dead?? Or did she ""die"" just so that she would no longer have to deal with the will that was at hand? I would read another one of his books...but I would hope for a better, more explained ending in the future."
4,Grisham forumula works again,Once again it is another good read by Grisham. It is hard to think what my will would be like if I get over a million dollars. I cannot see leaving it to a woman in some remote southn american jungle.
3,"not bad, but no law","it's funny how this book is roundly considered ""Grisham's best"" (if you believe the cover critics and the Amazon critics), and it happens to be a book having absolutely zero courtroom scenes. no nuance, no legal manipulations, no twists or turns - just a bildungsroman.without giving away the ending, dividing up 11 billion dollars just isn't a resolution that's satisfying. whether lousy characters get 1% of the estate, or 1.2%, do i really care about the decimal point?it's a nice story about a man (who happens to be an ex-lawyer) and his trip into the jungle, looking for someone but finding himself. it's not pulitzer prize stuff, but it's an enjoyable read."
2,"Good start, but mostly disappointing","I enjoyed the first chapter very much. However, things deteriorated fairly quickly for me.A book peopled with characters whom it is hard to identify with or like. The main protaginist is a boring drunk who finds religion. Enough said."
4,Different than his others,"I read this book after seeing Mr. G. interviewed on TV. Lots of people you love to hate and several you want to love. Starts out very strong and lures you in. Towards the end it would seem the author realized his book was getting a little long so he quickly wrapped it up by killing one of the main characters and giving the other a new life. When this becomes a movie (which it probably will) you can bet Mel Gibson or Harrison Ford will take the lead with some no-name, starkly beautiful actress. However the movie will probably spend more time developing the characters of the dysfunctional family and less time on the river swatting bugs. Generally a good read."
3,Good Read,"Sometimes I got tired of the jungle. I wanted to read more about the miserable lives of the Phelan clan (interesting name...felan...fallen) and about Andys life's turn-around.The book spans a little over two months and in that you spend most of your time on the Paraguay River in a swamp called the Pantal. There's really no ""Girsham"" courtroom drama which is what I think most people expect from one of his novels. If it weren't for the jungle advanture, during which nothing really happens...well, some things happen but we move on quickly) this would be a pretty boring short-story.Good weekend or vacation read, especially if you like South America."
3,Nothing like true family hatred,"A rich old man concocts a plan to remove his family from his will in the most curious way. What's left is a hectic aftermath where the family is suing, and the search for the missing sole heir takes a recovering alcoholic to the depths of the Amazon rainforest. A nice location piece, with action, vivid descriptions, and the usual mixture of Grisham law, is a good read.Grisham mixes in his great mix of characters, a great description of the Amazon and a removed Native American Brazilian tribe, and the intricacies of inheritance laws. While the plot moves quickly, there's not much to capture the attention. The reader shares no sympathies with any of the characters, and some characters are too one sided. At some points, the descriptions get a little dull and overwhelming, especially concerning the family and their lawyers.I'd like this book, but somehow it was unsatisfying. It's got the classic Grisham story telling substance, but it's too long for such a simple plot."
4,Good Grisham,"I'm a big John Grisham fan, and while I thought The Testament was interesting and entertaining, it was by far not my favorite Grisham novel.The story of an eccentric billionaire who demeans his family one final time in his will is built on a strong foundation. Grisham does a good job with character development through most of the story, and just when we are to meet a climax at the conclusion of the novel, he drops us off a cliff. Imaginitive and realistic at the same time, The Testament will reinforce in your will the evil that money can cultivate.All in all, not my favorite Grisham, but still worth the read."
4,CHANGE OF PACE FOR GRISHAM,"I have read many of John Grisham's books, liked some of them, loved some. This book was a change of scenery. Being a ""back to nature"" person myself, I enjoyed reading about how people in the absolute far corners of the world live. Sending someone from ""our world"" into this primitive land made it even more interesting. Here is a person who thought he could not live without cell phones and fax machines and computers and suddenly he comes face to face with a woman who has no interest in wordly possessions, not even when she discovers she is the heiress to a fortune."
3,The Testament : And then?,"Like all Grisham books, this one gets you in right from the beginning with a pacy opening and complicated, interesting characters. I found myself enjoying the journey,visualising the jungle with it`s beauty and dangers, involved with the natives and understanding and identifying with the conflicts of the troubled lawyer. However , I soon started to realise that we were running short of pages to satisfactorily conclude the adventure. At the end I felt let down with the lack of closure and suspicious that we`d been set up for a sequel. Enjoy it while it lasts."
4,My Testament,"I thought this was an excellent story, as are all of Grisham's tales. It kept me thinking about it when I wasn't able to read it, and very anxious to get back to the story to see where it would go!"
5,A hard to put down book,"The Testament is a great book, one you can't put down to long. You always have to find out what is going on next."
3,A light Book. (full of AIR),"When I read the back cover of the book I get interested in it. when I began, I thought it would have some kind of intelligent plot. After having read it; This is what i have to say:- The book have some of the basic principles of live one should apply. - Gives a description of what Pantanal and its people look like ( And I would like to visit it some day). I read the Book in 3 days, I could not stop reading, but i think it was because i was looking for fulfill my apetite (it never happend)."
4,The Testament,"I recently finished reading the The Testament and enjoyed it very much. I found it to be very intriguing and different from Grisham's previous books. He was faithful to his old style of revealing how many in the legal profession operate , but he also unfolded a story which was unique and uplifting in that morals are actually raised to a higher level - too bad the legal profession is so blind to their manipulations and devious ways. They ought to have to sign a lawyer type of Hypocratic Oath to protect the public from their profession and their greedy ways."
3,The Testament - Wished for more backstabbing and suspense,"It was a good story with some adventure and good characters. I enjoyed the characters and the story line. It could've been that Im use to the type of thriller like ""The Client"", but It was a good read, but I didn't think it was his best. I would've expected more suspense, underhanding and backstabbing especially with 11 Billion as the prize. I still recommend the book, but its a bit short on the suspense."
4,The Testament,"I tried to save this book for a 5 hour plane ride, but once I started I could not resist it. I actually forced myself to stop reading it for one day, but i couldn't help myself. It is refreshing to know that Grisham does not disappoint, even after all this time. What is depressing is the task of finding an equally gripping book for that plane ride. Highly recommend this book!"
3,Good but not great,"Even though The Testament has its good points, it's not the best piece of modern fiction that I've read. You never, in my opinion, get a REAL feel for the main character, Nate O'Riley. The end was disappointing and the furture of Nate is left unclear. Is Mr. Grisham laying the foundations for a sequel? If he is, I'm not sure I'd want to buy the next installment."
5,My favorite Grisham book,Characters that are interesting as is the norm for Grisham but it's really a story about redemption. My favorite Grisham book.
4,The Testament,"I didn't expect to enjoy this book as much as I did. Initially I thought the book a thriller, full of intrigue and bad guys bent on finding the elusive Rachael before Nate, a spine-tingling narrative of drug lords, villainous heirs, and heart-pounding escapes from the same. Not so. Instead it had a far gentler message of redemption, or repairing relationships, of escape from personal demons. The ending was perfect for this story and left me with a contemplative smile on my face. Not everyone would enjoy this since John Grisham is noted more for stories like The Firm and The Pelican Brief, but for me it was wonderful."
3,"Easy, Fast Pace Read....","Not one of Grisham's best. However the story is entertaining and the book is a fast pace easy read. Kinda like People Magazine. Grisham's book ""The Firm"" is my favorite, so if a beginner to his work, I'd start there."
2,"Finally, Grisham gets away from Southern USA, but...","Finally Grisham writes a novel that is based elsewhere, in this case Washington and Brasil. The storyline is interesting - excentric spiteful billionaire wanting revenge one last time on his ungrateful children and ex-wives. However, there is a lack of tension in this story, which seems to end a little too easily and with apparently no conflict. The winning side in this case is clear right from the start. The story has some interesting elements to it, but I found it overall disappointing in the end."
4,Take the time,A very good read.Time well spent.John Grisham has come into his own.Look forward to reading more of his work.every one should tak the time to read his work
2,Disappointed,"The Rainmaker, The Firm, Runaway Jury, A Time to Kill.....those are good, even great novels. Those stories drew you in, kept you reading, anticipating and even rooting for an outcome. Was very disappointed in this one. I felt like the words were quickly thrown onto paper to meet a deadline or get a paycheck and nothing more. Only reason I kept turning the pages is because I believed there had to be something more. Afterall, it is Grisham we're talking about."
3,OK,This book appeared to be lacking the color and the excitement. Or maybe I am getting tired of J. Grisham.
2,"take some time off, john!","I have been a Grisham fan for years, I loved all of his ""early"" books, but over the last few years he has become predictable and formulaic, writing only what will sell. The Testament fell right into those lines, making it extremely obvious that Grisham needs to take a little time off and try to figure out exactly what he wants as a writer, and stop writing for the money. The Testament is, so far, the worst of his books. It was overly predictable, boring in some parts, annoying in others, and the ending left me feeling like I never wanted to read another Grisham book again. Lets just hope that his success with a Painted House has given him a little time to rethink the way he has been writing the rest of his novels."
4,Great weekend read,"I grabbed 4 novels to take with me on a weekend trip to Las Vegas. I'm glad that the one I chose to read was The Testament. I wanted a book that I could start and finish during the trip. This was the perfect book. It's a fun, fast, and emotional read. It's fun to fantasize what you would do if handed $11 billion dollars (before taxes). I disagree with those who thought that the ending fizzled out. Let them come up with a better ending! Grisham never disappoints. I'd like to read the sequel."
1,awful,"One of the worst books I have ever read. Aimless, ridiculous and uninteresting story line. I am a big fan of his but this book was terrible, skip it."
2,Not His Best,"John Grisham is a great writer but this one had a rather dull plot. There were too many Phelan heirs to deal with and they (and their many lawyers) ran together after a while. I would rather have fewer characters and deeper story line for each. All in all, a less than intriquing book that was not up to par for the writer."
3,Great Bathroom Reading,"This work will not make you think, but it is a decent source of mindless entertainment. The story is predictable enough and seems to read like a movie."
4,Very Good - although not his best!,"Unlike many of the reviewers, I liked the end of the book. I dothink that John Grisham could make a very good sequel.If this wasyour first Grisham book, don't make it you last. Some of his books are entirely different, try The Client which is my favorite. The movie with Susan Sarandon and Tommy Lee Curtis is great too! END"
2,The book for the typical simple American,"If you're an American then you'll definately give this book 5 stars. Buy the book quick - this is surely something for you: no difficult words, simple yet totally unreal story, the hero turns from very baddy lawyer to a very gooooddie one in a couple hundred pages. This is another example of Grisham's new style of work: turn a bad guy into a Robin Hood type. Hooray! If you're not American then spend your hard earned money on something else or at least on Grisham's first 4 books - they were 1000% better."
4,Good Book,The Testement is a good book that i would highly recomend for adults.(Im a kid but that's okay). It is an exiting book and while it is not john grisham at his best(The Chamber is) it is a great book. I give it 4 stars.
3,I am having trouble reading this book...,"I have enjoyed all of the author's previous books and looked forward to reading this one. However, I have been able tp put it down easily. Usually I can't put Grisham's books down for very long. I am only halfway through it and hope the ending is worth the effort. I believe a more ""legal"" tone to the book would have been what I would have expected from Grisham."
4,"Good reading, but not Grisham's best.","I've enjoyed other of Grisham's novels more than this one, but this one is certainly worth reading. As a missionary pilot in South America for 20 years, I was taken right back to the jungles by Grisham's excellent descriptions. The plot was interesting with some delightful twists, but not as gripping as some of his other works."
2,Story Line confusing and disjointed not his best work,"The beginning of story was very interesting, and I thought it would be a spellbining story. However, the plot deteriorated as the story progressed. The degenerate nature of the main character was overly developed compared to the ""new guy"" he became after he met Rachel Lane. The author seemed to be exploring new territory as he attempted to delve into issues of spirituality. I am usually a fiend for Grisham books, and will read the next one. But this one was not his best effort. He should re-write the story using the skill, passion, and finesse he employed when writing ""A Time To Kill"""
2,"This is definitely not a ""have to read"" book.","Although I found the part of the story which took place in Brazil interesting, I found myself leafing through pages just to make the effort to get through the book. I personally did not like any of the heirs and so it was hard to read their life stories. Hope Mr. Grisham can create a more interesting book in the future."
4,"Kind of Predictble, but Mesmerizing Nevertheless","Grisham's novels are becoming more predictable, but his writing style is captivating, nevertheless. If you follow the ""good guy"", you already know the ""who"". Because Grisham's style is mesmerizing, you let it carry you to the ""how"". If Grisham can put more mystery in the who as well as the how, he'll score more than a ""triple play""."
1,the worst john grisham book ever . did he write this?,"what happened to john grisham ? did he need to fulfill a book contract ? minimal storyline , abysmal plot and those are the positives. if this keeps up i'll be forced to start writing."
1,This book was incredibly boring,"As an avid Grisham fan, I was very disappointed with this book. Truthfully, I couldn't even finish it, which is unheard of for me. But, Nate's journey to find Rachel just seemed to drag on forever and if that wasn't enough, I really had difficulty reading about the nasty ""heirs"" to the old man's fortunes. They couldn't ALL be so horrid, could they? Very boring-I would not recommend this book to anyone."
1,"In a word, YUCK!","I am an avid reader and with an undergraduate major and a masters degree in English I have read many a novel. Without a doubt, The Testament is one of the all-time worst stories I have ever had the misfortune of reading. I don't want you to think I'm saying this because I don't like Grisham's style. Some of my all-time favorite books have been written by John Grisham; but about half way through this one I almost stopped reading it."
1,Very boring and pointless.,"I have read and re-read many of John Grisham's books, I love the fast pace and the wonderful characters in his previous books, but 'The Testament' was a big disappointment. No pace, no chase, no suspense, no interesting courtroom legalities, no interesting characters. Just floating in a boat in the jungle."
1,No characters worth caring about,"Troy Phelan's plot to get his last testament executed the way he wanted it was mildly interesting, but there were hundreds of pages left after that. No suspense thriller, this.I've read all the reviews and have to wonder: Many of the 5-star raves sound like they were written by Grisham's publicist or publishing house. I'd advise readers to take these online reviews with a grain of salt. I loaned my copy of The Testament to other Grisham fans, all of whom were 1) disappointed and 2) relieved they hadn't bought it."
2,Yawn,"Am I the only one who wanted to read more about the greedy heirs than Nate's adventures in Brazil. I found myself dozing off when during the travels in the Pantanal. I think we've read enough about South America and barefoot boys playing soccer in the streets. It's time to get back to the basics, Mr. Grisham. More books like the Runaway Jury would be nice."
2,Tedious and monochromatic,"An attempted journey into the Heart of Darkness that sinks. No surprises, no romance, no gripping characters after the multibillionaire dives off the terrace. Grisham is no Hillerman in using a vast rivery swamp as a character. Yawn."
5,A Hard Time Putting It Down,"The Testament is another I would definitely read again, the plot had twists which I can see actually happening, from Troy Phelans careful wording in his final testament that gives his heirs exactly what they deserve, his children's so many different attitudes and lifestyles including both greed and faith, to Nate O'Rileys struggles with his own personal life that takes him on a trip and change in convictions he never expected.I so appreciated the Christian lesson of faith and the knowledge that we always have the option to make a change in our lives in spite of the path we have been on, Nate O'Rileys search for Rachel shows that nothing is as easy as it appears, and money may not always be the answer.From fighting traffic in a snow covered city, depositions with greedy heirs, your own addictions, and even mosquitoes while floating down a sweltering jungle river, the battles are so interesting and the ending in my opinion was perfect."
3,I've had enough of Brazil!,"I guess I'm looking for another THE FIRM or A TIME TO KILL. This book starts off interestingly enough, but I got bogged down in Brazil and couldn't breathe. I also anticipated what the protagonist would find. Not one of the better John Grisham books, but for an evening or two's entertainment, it's okay."
2,"Good Start, but.....","This books has a fascinating start. But once the will gets read, it slips slowly down hill. Half the book -- a trip through the swamp -- is quite boring. The best character - Josh - never gets developed. Once again, Grisham makes a legal blunder: a witness admits in deposition that 4 attorneys paid him $500,000 to testify -- yet, no one files a bar complaint? John, wake up, you are a good writer but no one will buy into that scenario. This could have been a great book, with a different direction. I did like the Christian aspect, just didn't like how we got there."
3,well?,"Like a good boxing match, it gets better round by round. However, Grisham just couldn't deliver the knockout punch. Winner by decision. It's a ""win"" but not by a ""KO""! He's much better than that! Unfulfilled!"
2,Cardboard characters and a strained plot,"John Grisham seems to be spending less and less time writing his novels, and the plots and character development show it. A Time to Kill and The Firm are well-plotted with several characters that are more than cardboard cutouts. But once he quit lawyering and writing part-time and started writing full time, his books have grown increasingly flat. Yes, he'll still sell thousands of copies and probably wouldn't sell any more if he were to spend more time at crafting his works. But it's disappointing that he is unwilling or unable to realize his potential."
5,One of Grisham's best,"This is one of Grisham's best books. I was beginning to think he was more intent on plugging his political views rather than writing a really good novel. He is back on track with this one.I will admit that other reviewers' criticism that Grisham didn't spend enough time on the religious conversion is probably very true. Since, as we Grisham fans know, he is very capable of going on ad nauseum on a favorite topic (homeless, cigarette companies, etc.) I hate to write that he needed to spend more time with this - but that is the only criticism I can find.This novel is a very fast read. I was hooked from page one and by the end of the 2nd chapter, I knew I wasn't going to put it down until I finished it.I recommend this as a great, fun way to spend a Saturday, or any other day of the week."
2,Disappointing and dull,"This may be Grisham's most disappointing effort yet. I finished the book out of a dogged curiousity to see if it might take off somewhere with anything even remotely resembling a Grisham plot, the answer: uh-uh. For better plotting, characterization and ability to hold your interest, try the New Testament. While I can certainly get behind the idea of an alcoholic, workaholic, sexaholic lawyer having a come-to-Jesus experience in the jungles of Brazil, this book doesn't even come close to being convincing."
3,Grisham gets religion--and tries to force it on his readers,"This book should have been placed in the ""Religious"" section. The initial chapters were among the most compelling I've read in quite a while, but the pace fell off badly after that. While the premise was fairly intriguing, the heavy-handed emphasis on religion spoiled it for me, and I found the radical changes in the main character's attitude and motivations highly implausible."
3,"For the first time, Grisham left me wanting...","Grisham's lack of character development in this mulit-continent, far-fetched, legal travelog left me wanting much more. I have read all of his previous books and usually enjoy climbing inside each character. With 'Testament' he gives the reader some teaser information and then fails to deliver. I wanted to know more about Nate and Rachel. I felt the reader was introduced to a splattering of characters, but was left feeling most were superficial and 2D, very unusual in a Grisham novel. I was left wanting more."
2,One word: BORING,"I usually like Grisham. His contempt for the legal profession is amusing & there is some of that contempt here. This book starts off really good & quickly turns in to an adventure down a river. BORING. If I want a travelogue/study of other cultures thing, I will go find Michener"
3,A Screen Play just begging to be committed to film,"This was the old weird rich family fights over the patriarch's estate. There was nothing out of the ordinary to this plot. I was particularly insulted at the portrayal of the lawyers in this bitter litigation over Troy Phelan's estate. Grisham, a lawyer, left the impression that lawyers who are bound by ethical codes to preserve their licenses and livelihoods would stoop so low as to purchase testimony. Grisham should applaud the lawyers who devote their time, ingenuity and careers to pro bono efforts and just causes seeking no more than the betterment of their clients' predictments as well as society as a whole. Nate O'Reilly who turns his life around and pursues a just cause is actually a breath of fresh air, not surprisingly by leaving the practice of law. If you hate lawyers, read this book. If you come from the other camp, stay away."
5,"il miglior libro di grisham, sicuramente.","Il miglior libro di Grisham, sicuramente. Con la maturità migliora, evidentemente, la sua capacità di scrivere: nel ""testimone"" ci sono tutti gli ingredienti di un grande romanzo pieno di suspence, indagine e gli ingredienti tipici dei legal thriller. l'ho letto con qualche difficoltà perche' non conoscono benissimo l'inglese ma l'ho divorato in soli due giorni.michele genchi - roma - italia"
2,Too religious...yawn,"Yawn...too ridiculous to believe. This is a book about lawyers? How? Searching the jungles, getting sober...yawn. Not a bad book overall, but definitely not a John Grishmam type book. Has John found religion all of a sudden?"
2,Grisham doesn't know squat about Canada.,"This novel contains an exhaustive description of the Panatal region in South America, yet John Grisham refers to a woman in the story being born in an igloo in Newfoundland, Canada. How can Grisham know so much about one area of the world, and so little about another? Try doing some just basic research on your friendly neighbors to the North, John. You may just find we live in a modern society, and that igloo's are what American's only think Canadian's live in."
4,All-time great first chapter-rest of the book interesting,Stunningly gripping beginning to an interesting book. Characters seem drawn to be all bad or all good with exception of Nate (main lawyer) who seeks redemption for his many sins. A good read but more complex characters would have made it better.
4,Another beautifully written story by Grisham,"Grisham's is an incredible writer, and this story was a great read. It was a bit slow at times but the overall storyline was very interesting. This novel was quite different than his previous ones because the main focus of it was not in the courtroom. I mean that in a good way."
4,A great book!,"I have read all of John Grisham's novels and was hooked from the start but after a few books the style became very boring. The last few of his novels I have really had to force myself to fully read, being very tempted to turn to the last page for the ending and put the book down. This latest book however is really refreshing. The storyline is new; I had a real giggle over the family rubbing their hands together waiting for their booty; and then thoroughly enjoyed his descriptive trip to find Rachel. The book had me interested to the very last page. Well done John, I look forward to your next novel now."
4,The best book John Grisham has ever written!,The Testament is a very good book. It show's that money to some people is not everything. And what is so great about the book is that people who have a lot of money get awful greedy at times. It is a good read for any one that needs a wake up call.
2,not wonderful,"Mr. Grisham's last two books have left me with the same feeling. He's writing, telling not a half bad story...looks down and sees that he's got enough pages written for a book. Regardless of where he is in the story line, he wraps it up and calls it done. I won't bother reading another one."
3,Could be a better novel,"I have read all of John Grisham's books. This one is certainly not among the first three, but off course much better than thr recent ones. The subject is interesting but the outcome is a little bit like a chewing gum, sticky and stretchy..."
4,Great Book,"John Grisham has done it again with this engrossing book. Once I started reading it, I could never put it down. The character and plot development is wonderful. Don't pass this one up!"
2,Not the Grisham we know and love,"I found The Testament the least enjoyable of Grisham's books. It is as if he ""got religion"" and wanted to share the word in good missionary form. Some of the book was informative, however. His description of the Pantanal in South America was interesting. For this reason I gave the book two stars. I generally pass on the Grisham books to friends but won't be recommending this particular one."
1,Very Dull,"Boring, Boring, Boring! It was all I could do to finish this book. The first couple of chapters are really good, but it goes downhill from there. It's all too predictable"
4,NEEDED MORE DEPTH,"I enjoyed this book but felt the characters needed more fleshing out. I didn't particularly like anyone person in the story with the exception of Jevy. I feel the ending leaves things open for a sequel (which is not Grisham's style) but it's an idea. What will Nate do with the trust, how will he spend it and how much of a fuss will the spoiled brats make when they find out the whole story?"
1,Sorry. I thought it boring,"Grisham is the master of the unnecessary detail. He pads out his story by telling us more than we want to know.I guess I'm in a minority, but I found ""The Testament"" a colossal bore."
3,Not his best,"I've read many Grisham novels and The Testament was not his best. However, it was still a pretty entertaining read.While the premise sounded promising- a billionaire dies while his family fights over the money he left behind...we're thrown into a story where a lawyer travels to the remotest areas of Brazil in order to find a long lost daughter. Still sounded interesting, however it sort of played out a little less than exciting. At points it sort of dragged. But towards the end it did pick up again.Overall it was ok, not my favorite of his. But, I did enjoy the story and the moral Grisham was trying to convey. Good ending too."
4,Another Great by Grisham,I just finished reading this book and I have to say it kept me on my feet. I enjoyed reading this book though before I even started the book I thought it wasn't going to be that great but since it was a Grisham book I gave it a chance and I am very happy that I did. It was adventurous it went from the courtroom to a search in Brazil. I recommend this book.
1,is it really worth it?,I truly thought it was poorly written and doesn't deserve all the publicity it is getting.
1,What happened to John Grisham?,"B-o-r-i-n-g! ""The Testament"" has a thin plot that loses the readers interest after the first few chapters. I bought this book on the strength of readers reviews and was very disappointed--no suspense, no tension."
1,The Testament is even worse than The Chamber.,"This has to be Grisham's worst outing yet. The story about the search through Brazil is so tedious and boring that I nearly threw the book against the wall. I finished it merely out of a morbid curiousity. I was surprised by the ending, however, in that it didn't have the requisite Grisham-read-like-a-screenplay-and-fade-to-black quality. I am a true Grisham fan, but I would not recommend The Testament to my worst enemy."
1,It made my head hurt,"This is the worst piece of Grisham trash yet!!! Every book is about a southern lawyer, Doesn't he understand that no one likes southern lawyers?!"
3,Here's how to read this book:,"Enjoy greatly the first half of the book up until the main character goes to brazil, then throw away the book to preserve your sweet memory."
1,Won't B Buyin' This One!,"I have been a Grisham fan since A Time To Kill. Before every body got on the bandwagon with The Firm (still Grisham's best work to date). His recent work has sucked. He has gotten lazy. I will not be buying this one ( but I will check it out at the library). Notice how all the reviews are good BEFORE the release then SUCK after the release? Take a hint from a fan, save your money! Let's send 'ol Johnny a message with our wallets to get his tail in gear!"
1,NOT Grisham's finest hour,"A derranged billionaire, bickering losers buried in debt and a fanatic hiding in the ends of the world for heirs of an enormous fortune. That is the Phelan Legacy. A study in failed marriages and addictions with rabid sharks willing to go to the verge of disbarment in exchange for a fat commission. The Piranhas were not swimming in the Pantanal River, they were backstabbing each other in the courtrooms of Washington D.C. It is a page turner all right. I could not wait to see the end of it and put this miserable story to bed. Not to mention that the end was absolutely predictable."
3,"Another Grisham, or is it?","Testament departs from Grisham's courtroom drama theme without actually abandoning the lawyer experience genre. I enjoyed reading this book, but don't expect a typical Grishamesque experience."
4,Most Excellent,"Some of Grisham works require a love of the law to really appreciate but this is a down to earth page turner. It is well written and although a stretch on the plot plausibility, very entertaining, inhabited by real life type characters. Definately worth reading."
3,Two novels in one,"I have read all of Grisham's work and always look forward to reading his latest. Some have been better than others, of course, but reading The Testament (and listening to the audiobook later) was a very schizophrenic experience for me. I thought the part concerning Nate, Rachel and the fantastic location of the rainforest was great--interesting, unusual and the plot certainly kept my attention. But when the story went back to the Phelan family nightmare, I asked myself if it was the same book. The characters here are so stereotyped they seem like caricatures--so obnoxious and greedy as to be farcical. I remember thinking ""Come on, John, you can do better than all these cardboard cutouts."" Nevertheless, the intriguing glimpse he gave us of life along the Amazon and its tributeries made reading the novel worthwhile. (Besides, Nate is someone I can sort of relate to!)"
2,The Testament,"I have read every John Grisham book from ""A Time to Kill"" through ""The Testament."" I must say that each successive book has shown less creativity and imagination, culminating with The Testament. The alcoholic and/or drug addicted misfit, working amongst the vultures of the large corporate law firm, that suddenly discovers his values in time to save the day is becoming a tired theme."
3,An OK - Grisham book,"Whenever I travel I try to find a new John Grisham book at the airport to take with me on the flight. The first 100 pages of The Testament was very exciting. And I also enjoyed the locations Grisham described both in and around DC - and in the jungle. I think the author tried to make connotations to Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"". Only with little luck. Apart from the ending the book is good. The author seems to have a problem with a good and well deserved ending."
4,"Like the Old and the New, The Testament leaves questions.","One of the best beginnings - why not write in the first person of the VERY wealthy man who commits suicide, and then deal with the fallout of his controversial will? Yes, the ending leaves questions of the spiritual type - does Nate really get it? Will any of the Phelan children ever get it? A great read from beginning to end -and some questions to think about when it is over."
2,Disappointing,"The main disappointment was due the the books by Grisham I had read previously. This one is so inferior - I felt I was reading something rushed, too commercial. This doesn't prevent me, though, from remaining a faithful Grisham reader."
2,Quite disappointing,"I've been a Grisham fan ever since I read A Time to Kill. I've read all of his works, and enjoyed many. However, this latest entry into his collection of novels was by far the least enjoyable of anything he's written. His writing style has become incredibly dull, and if I weren't a fan (less of one now) I would not have finished the book. He's gotten away from his style of old, and opted towards a newer, more dull and politically centered style, which I found completely boring. Needless to say, I do not think that I will be purchasing the next Grisham book, since he's declined to a new low with The Testament."
4,Interesting Story,"The Testament, overall, is a rather good book but it wasn't as entertaining as the others. You should like this book if you are a Grisham fan, but if you aren't then only if you are a jungle fan you might like it.Think of The Testament as this: a drunk man who peddals down the jungle looking for some missionary woman with the Indians. He finds her. She doesn't want the money. And, as expected, all the legal stuff comes in, then the end.Be prepared to read this book nonstop for some time, because that's what usually happens with Grisham books. That is basically the difference between him and others. His books are entertaining to some extent. But some people think he doesn't write well, but what is the definition of ""writing well""? Everyone has their own opinions, but I think his writing is logical and candid, and ultimately that's what sets him apart. As I said before, everyone is entitled to their opinions."
4,WOW!,"What a great book! Having read all of Grisham's works, I would rate ""The Testament"" third best only to ""The Firm"" and ""The Street Lawyer"". Many people say they dislike the ending and that it's to quick, I personally think it is perfect. I mean how else could you end it. How did you like this book? Tell me."
2,Wimpy,Big Disappointment! The story had no thrill or edge. I read through it only because I was on vacation and had nothing else to read. I will give The Brethern a chance only because I have loved all his other books (except The Street Lawyer only earned 3 stars from me).
3,glad it fell into my hands,"I read some of the not-so-favorable reviews and although I had already started reading this book I continued on. I'm glad I did. Definitly different than the other Grisham books I've read, which I found refreshing. I liked that it was not predictable as other writers tend to get. Nice change of pace!"
4,"As usual, a very good read.",I really enjoyed it. It was difficult to put down. It even entered my dreams in an intense sort of way. It was a very good read.
2,Aimless journey into avarice and the Brazilian jungle,"I was very disappointed in this novel. Although I applaud Mr. Grisham's attempt to get away from superhero lawyers and the streets of Memphis, he did so without any direction. The characters are poorly developed and flat. They are either evil and greedy, or drunks. Even the protagonist only changes his ways when he is led to do so, either by his therapist or this faultless ""angel"" in the jungle. The various subplots do not fit together very well. And, in the end, the hero of our story just capitulates to the slimy offspring of the writer of The Testament. I kept waiting to care about someone or something in this book. It never happened."
3,Good message but not one of his best,"I always read Grisham's books the day they're released. The premise was excellent, and I hoped for more than I got. After the first captivating chapter, the book dragged. The bad guys had no redeeming qualities whatsoever, and the good guys were not developed very well either. Still, I did think the book had a nice message worth pondering. For better plots and characters, try Richard North Patterson and David Baldacci."
5,Wow.,I read legal thrillers to escape. I love them -- but with a bit of guilty pleasure as one consuming junk food for the mind. Not this one though. This book combines the thrill of escapist reading with a wholesome and affirming message that feeds the heart and mind.
4,A welcome change from the technical,"I loved this book. I agree that the beginning was really slow and dragged on; that's why I gave it four stars instead of five. I thought it was wonderful and enjoyed the fact that Grisham stepped away from his typical style. Usually his books are so fast-paced and technical, you're almost tired when you're done. This was easy to read and just a lovely story. Loved the Christianity and didn't find it preachy, the idea of Nate's redemption and new life was terrific. We all have a second chance."
5,LOVED this book.,"Ending was very unpredictable, makes for a bittersweet read but is definitely worth your time. John Grisham has outdone himself."
5,John Grisham scores again,"In the midst of the fast-paced world of litigation, this book provides us with a glimpse into a less cluttered, more serene lifestyle where none of the former matters. The main character's life is transformed by his contact with a young woman whose simple, selfless existence is in direct contrast to his own. John Grisham has a definite talent in making the reader feel as though he wishes that he knew the characters personally. This book is one of my personal favorites."
5,Another Grisham winner.,"I am still reading this book but so far it is as good, or even better, than other novels by Grisham I have read."
3,Not Grisham's best,"While I found this book to be amusing and fairly interesting, I really don't agree with other reviewers that say that this ranks with Grisham's best works so far.The least 'legal' of his 'legal thrillers', this in none the less a good read. Characters are sympathetic, the story is imaginative and interesting. The setting in the Amazon is greatly described and draws you in. The ending...well, I think the ending is the weakest part in the book -- not compromising or brave, it is too simple and to wishy-washy for me.I've read all of Grisham's books (well, not including Painted House), and I have to say that second to Street Lawyer, this is probably his least successful effort."
4,The Power of God vs Mammon,"This is my first read of a John Grisham novel. I look forward to more. I enjoyed this one very much.What happens when an $11 Billion fortune is at stake in a legal battle where the obvious heirs have been written out of the will, which instead names a reclusive missionary who has no interest in the money as sole heir? Here we see in dramatic detail what money and power can do to spoil the lives of many and how irrelevant it is for the happiness and contentment of one. In between is a man, Nate O'Reilly, who learns the power of redemption after nearly destroying his life (no easy journey).The characters and their circumstances are realistically portrayed. The story has an exciting pace and a remarkable ending. Well worth the time spent reading."
2,"Easy, but uneventful, read","This book was a very easy read, and it did keep my attention. I kept waiting for something to happen, which never did. This story would have had much more substance to it without all of the insignificant, unending details. Instead of detailing the smallest, irrelevant event, I would have like to have seen better development of the characters, mainly the family. I feel that the majority of this story was done just to fill in the pages. All in all, it's worth a read as long as you don't expect too much."
2,Fun read - dull ending,"I enjoyed reading this book, primarily because I was in the mood for a fast and easy read after the holidays. The book starts out with a bang, and the story was fun to follow. But, my main criticism of almost all Grisham books continues to be that the author doesn't seem to know how to end something. Everything gets wrapped up too neatly and easily, and that's it. I wanted more - after the great beginning and interesting middle, I felt cheated with a cop-out ending."
4,The Testament,"The Testament is very good, giving the reader views about everything in The Pantanal, and about the struggles of life there. The first 50 or so pages are great, giving you a narrative description of how Mr. Phelan, the billionaire himself on what he thinks of his family, and everything from the suicide to the decision to write a new will are great. Mr. Grisham in no way disappoints the reader who expects to see a lot of money involved, greed, and vulture-like ways of lawyers. Good book, a bit different scenario than most Grisham novels, having most characteristics of Grisham's previous bestsellers."
5,The most inspiring novel I have read in a long time,"After listening to the abriged audiobook version of The Testament, I was so moved by the story that I immediately read the full-length version and found it one of the most inspiring novels I have read in a long time. It's no wonder that it became the #1 NY Times best-seller so quickly. As an avid Grisham reader, I have always found him to be a master of suspense with socially relevant themes. The Testament was a pleasant surprise with its theme of spiritual recovery and redemption reminiscent of the best of Graham Greene. I admire Grisham for his ability to write such a popular best-seller without the gratuitous sex and foul language so prevalent in other writers of this genre and for his skill in writing a book that is both suspensful and inspirational."
4,A page turner,This book was a departure from the books I would normally buy. I am glad I took that detour. The book was hard to put down in that the story line and plot were extremely well developed and the book was very thought provoking.
3,Couldn't put it down...,"Even though I couldn't put down the book from the moment I picked it up, I felt disappointment after reading the book. The narrative was long about his time in Brazil, and much of I skipped because I thought the book could have gone without it. It is exciting though as you keep reading to try and find out what happens to the Phelan heirs, but I wish the outcome could have been different."
1,"Action, Please?","Wow! What a stunning DEAD END! This book is a serious mark against the Grisham that America has had the privilege to enjoy. Gone are the days of fast-moving, action-packed, page-turning suspense thrillers from this author. Don't get me wrong, THE FIRST 100 PAGES WERE GOOD! After that, though, save your time and do something more important and exciting, like laundry."
2,Very disappointing ending!!!,"I thought the book was very good up until the end. I was very disappointed that Mr. Phelan's children got anything. And to have Rachel die in the end, what was that about? Very disappointing! I was hoping she and Nate would get together and do good things with the money. The brain tumor made more sense, why would someone that healthy, rich and powerful spend time in an unneeded wheelchair and then jump to his death. I could understand with the brain tumor but without it, WHY? I'm a big John Grisham fan, have read all his books but this one was a disappointment. I"
1,Not worth the time or money,"Not witty, interesting or entertaining.... It's only a dull plot, leading to the lawyer's convertion thru religion, not very likely.... It's sad to see a good writer lose his imagination and sense of wonder.... He needs to retire and convert, his call now is the religion, not the writing!!! 700 club can use him as a co-host!"
2,Not Interesting enough to finish,"This novel had a strong beginning -- even if somewhat implausible -- about an eccentric who is about to screw all of his heirs out of his billions and leave it to his unknown illegitimate daughter who has become a very holy missionary.I got as far as the alcoholic lawyer (likeable, of course) finding the missionary and finally turned to the end of the book to see if my suspicions about the plot were confirmed.One question: why were all the heirs so stupid as to agree to such a huge contingency fee for the lawyers?"
3,"great beginning, disappointing ending",The beginning just takes the breath out of you but towards the ending the suspense is lost and the pace slows. The action and the intrigue found in his other novels is missing. Despite this it does have a good storyline.
2,Grisham's written better,"I've listened to most of Grisham's audiobooks, and this is the worst yet. The South American adventures are boring ... but the legal twists are fascinating (particularly the first chapter). Get out of the jungle, John, and go back to the courtroom! And while you're at it, bring back Michael Beck. Muller is good, but his narration pales beside Beck's. Michael, I miss you!"
1,Not the Usual Grisham,John Grisham is one of my favorite authors. This story is slow moving and has little intrigue. It is more about a trip through the jungle than a legal thriller.
2,How big is Brazil?,"Couldn't believe I was able to find this at the local jockey lot at $10.00 before it was released. Now I know why. Grisham leads us to believe that it would be little or no trouble finding someone lost deep in the jungles and waters of Brazil. If the book hadn't been by my favorite author, I wouldn't have finished it. I gave an extra star because I like books that read fast and this one does."
4,COULDN'T PUT THE BOOK DOWN,"EXCELLENT BOOK! WELL WRITTEN. THE ONLY THING MISSING WAS INVESTIGATION OF THE LEAD'S RELATIONSHIPS ALONG THE WAY. IN ""A TIME TO KILL"", (HIS BEST), YOU KNEW THE RELATIONSHIPS. THE BOOK WAS ALWAYS EXCITING AND SPELLBINDING. I FELT LIKE I COULD SEE WHAT HE SAW. FEEL WHAT HE FELT."
2,like a cheap romance novel,"Well, maybe I expected too much again, but this book was so easy to read, I knew after 20 pages how it would end.. Compared with his other books even the street lawyer which was not one of his best this book ranks for me at the very end. do not bother...."
3,Captivating... but typical Grisham.,"It was difficult to put ""The Testament"" down at first. The excitement of the activity caused by Troy's death left you predicting what would happen next, yet Grisham was able to throw in a few surprises. The descriptions of the soon-to-be rich folks makes a humble reader wonder if people can really be that uncaring and predisposed to money. This takes away from the story a bit. One instantly sides with the hero character. Grisham does well in detailing Brazil and a culture very few know about. The story lagged a bit with Nate as the main character. He had too much baggage and it slowed the river boat down at times, so to speak. With just a few pages left to read, and the conclusion not obvious, though lurking in the back of my mind, Grisham ends the story nicely and respectfully... just enough for this reader to look forward to the next Grisham novel. Overall a good weekend read, but a typical Grisham lawyer story."
1,The Testament is Minor League,"Reading The Testament is like watching Micheal Jordan play minor league baseball. You just pray he'll get back to his true calling soon. The detour started with The Partner and has continued with The Street Lawyer and The Testament. Grisham's heart and soul is the Deep South and it's complex issues and compelling characters. When you add the expert legal drama it's magic. The Testament has no magic. The plot is strained and sometimes preachy, and I never liked or sympathized with any of the characters. The only saving grace is the interesting legal manuvering which Grisham never fails to deliver on. Hopefully sometime soon he'll release a new book that says ""I'm Back!"""
1,FAR from his best,"This is not the same John Grisham that kept us gripping the book 'white-knuckled' in The Client and The Partner. I was spoiled by Mr. Grisham's earlier books, but since Street Lawyer and now Testament fell flat - I think Mr. Baldacci is #1. Thanks for the memories, John."
1,This book is fair. He has written many good books,"The book starts out running, then jogs, then walks, then crawls ad infinitum. Then starts running again, slows down and just loses it. Grisham seems to write his books in great detail and then he seems to tire and decides to just end them quickly. I like his books but his endings don't justify all the details."
2,Not Grisham's usual suspense filled book.,The first three chapters were funny. It trails off and becomes boring. If you are going to read this book borrow a friend's. This is from a true Grisham fan.
3,Not one of his best,"This is probably one of his weakest books. The first 2/3 of the book are up to his usual standard, but near the end the book becomes kind of rushed. It is almost as if he needed to meet a deadline and had to finish the book in a hurry. It was a disappointing ending."
3,A par for the course for Grisham's latest novel,"The Testament is now what the public has become used to reading from Grisham: the underdog attorney reaching the moralized cliche of midlife crisis. The novel is interesting for the first half of the novel, then it meanders its way to a predictable ending. With this novel as well as The Street Lawyer, Grisham seems to be internalizing all of the protaganist's thoughts. Grisham needs to bring back the brashness and cockiness that permeated novels like The Firm, The Pelican Brief and The Partner. If you decide to go ahead and read this novel, wait for paperback."
1,The downward spiral continues,"John Grisham no longer writes novels--he's cranking out screenplays now--and boy are they preachy.If you thought The Street Lawyer was bad, wait until you get your hands on this one. It ought to come with its own soapbox.Very disappointing. Where do I go to get back the four hours I wasted on this?"
2,Not worth reading,I have read a lot of Grisham novels and this is not one of his best works. The storyline is pretty boring and the end is really disappointing.
2,Misrepresented as a mystery novel,"The Testament disappointed. I have enjoyed most of Grisham's works but in ""The Chamber"" and now in ""The Testament"" he fosters his opinions on capital punishment (Chamber) and born again religion (Testament) on his readers who are expecting a good legal/mystery thriller. I felt cheated and was upset with time spent reading The Testament. If he and his publishers were more candid those who like this type of book can choose it and the rest of us will pass. Grisham is a good writer, but I do not wish to be preached to by him."
2,why i would'nt reccomend this book,"The book, The Testament by John Grisham is not a good book in my opinion. The book is a little hard to follow because of the point of view. It jumps around on characters, it goes from first to third omniscient.The characters were not explained well enough in my opinion.The only character that felt explained enough to me was the main character who killed himself.The conflict was not hard enough to solve in my opinion. All the man had to do was fly to Brazil to find this daughter he had that no one knew he had. All in all its just not a very good book to read."
2,"Outstanding 1st chapter, plummeted to low ground thereafter",This was a book that promised to deliver. The reviews have been way out of proportion. The first chapter was certainly catching. Thereafter the book moved slowly with a mindless ending. After a good read I always feel as if I have been part of something. Ater this book I felt as if I had been cheated of time I could have spent in more worthy endeavors.
4,Mr. Grisham begins to make a comeback,"As bad a ""The Street Lawyer"" was this book makes up for it. Like many others I had sworn off reading another book by John Grisham. After several people telling me this book was much better; I gave it a try. It was considerably better than ""The Street Lawyer"". At times it's even hard to put down. After reading it I must admit I was disappointed in the ending, but then I remembered the reason for not liking some of his previous works was their predictable endings. You won't predict the end of this one. It's all in all a fun story to read. Mr. Grisham even managed to jump off the soapbox for a good portion of the book."
2,a mediocre effort among in an otherwise stellar list,"This book had promise. I found myself completely engrossed in Mr. Phelan's life and his vindictive but brilliant plan to screw his deadbeat family. Once they started going to the foreign country to find Rachel, the book became boring. I had a hard time keeping interested to finish it. The end was so anti-climatic. It was a great start and he should have expanded on the effects of his will with the deadbeat family and less time about the rainforest search for Rachel. Hopefully, his next book will get back to the brilliance of The Client, The Firm and the others."
3,Grishom doesn't stick his landings well,"I agree with the other reviewer who said this book ends badly. It seemed as though the book was finished for a deadline. The build up was great, and I was turning pages very quickly, but the ending was a bit abrupt."
3,Falls short of excellence,"High average novel, good story line and generally well written although it was not nearly as fast paced or well written as ""Whose Death in the Tunnel?"" by Becker. Again a good novel, but it just falls short of excellence."
3,A little short,"I am an absolute fan of John Grisham but this latest work of his falls short of his previous spell binding works. The TESTAMENT is only the second Grisham work (the other is A TIME TO KILL) that I was able to put down for more than a few hours and return to it with an attitude of ""I guess I should finish this book up"" rather than the typical ""I have to finsish this!"". The place setting is intresting, but the story falls short on excitement, which is what I always have attached to John Grisham novels. I am hoping the next Grisham work will return to the on-the-edge feeling of THE FIRM and THE PELICAN BRIEF. The cat-and-mouse plots which are more entertaining and exciting than anything."
2,Grisham se ha vuelto autocomplaciente,"Grisham me gustaba, y no me resigno a dejar de pasar buenos ratos con sus libros. Espero que el próximo suponga una vuelta a una estupenda historia que te deja sin aliento, como The Firm, o a un hermoso e inteligente alegato contra la pena de muerte (The chamber). The testament naufraga precisamente por sus buenas intenciones: Grisham quiere decir algo, pero no se atreve del todo, y no es porque no sepa hacerlo, seguro que no. Lo que ocurre es que los hechos que narra se comen la trama, es decir, no llegamos a saber exactamente qué quiere decirnos el autor. El final es excesivamente simple, y tal vez demasiado rápido, como si Grisham ya se hubiera cansado de escribir la historia. Por otra parte, hay que decir, a su favor, que es una novela entretenida, en la que destaca sobre todas las cosas, incluso más que la belleza de los parajes brasileños, la personalidad de Nate O'Riley, el protagonista."
3,It could've been better,"The beginning of the book takes your breath away. The discription of the Panatal and Brazilian forests aree wonderful. But the story is too short to be one. It reeally becomes boring. The ending comes very quickly, measured to the rest of the story."
5,My First John Grisham Experience,"This was my first John Grisham novel. Wow! I cannot believe what I have been missing! This novel hits home to me. We live in modern times and this book shows how greed for money can make you do some unbelievable things. I was hooked from the first page of the book. We can be so selfish as human beings and this novel shows many examples of that. It is unbelievable that some people put money before family or friends. I do not want to give away anything about this book. If you have not ever read a John Grisham novel, you will not be disappointed by choosing this book."
5,can't stop reading,"what a fun book to read. Loved the missionaries and the islands, and the greedyaverage couples back home. Liked the priceless bug spray - I laughed while I read this book! I almost cried when the book ended - I could read this one forever!"
4,Very good,The book kept my interest and it had excellent values. I would recommend that anyone who likes Grisham's books should read this one.
2,Quick to read -- but not worth the time,"You'll read this book in one night, and hate yourself in the morning. Grisham has, as usual, created a compelling plot line. But the characterization is too quick and stereotyped, even for the character we get to know best, Nate O'Riley. His conversion to Christianity is almost casual in Grisham's hands, handled in paragraph long cliches, and as a result unconvincing. The plot is predictable (and the text, at times, repetitive). Despite all this it will hold your interest; it's a fine beach read, if that's a compliment. But at the end you'll wonder what you might have done with the time you just spent."
4,"The Good, The Bad and the Ugly","The Good:Good character development with regard to ""Nate"", the protagonist, who deals with his own demons while simultaneously having to trudge through the wilds of South America. The story moves quickly and keeps you reading and Grisham does a great job of describing the Pantanal region of South America and working it into the story.The Bad:There are too many poorly developed minor characters (exwives, kids, lawyers, etc.) to care about or keep track of and it tends to make things a little confusing.The Ugly:The book centers around an epic legal battle in the making that ultimately ends in a quick, uninteresting and unsatisfying whimper. I can think of 10 endings to this particular plot line that would have been better.Overall:This is the first Grisham book I've read and it's worth reading for the story, but don't expect a big climactic finish or you'll be disappointed."
2,"Decent ""adventure"", but . . .","While the book was well-written, and there are certainly some exciting sequences, the book never really arrives anywhere.Phelan's heirs don't come across so much ""evil"" as they do as victims of circumstances (a man who, rather than give his children care and love, just gave them $5 million each when they turn 21; he then took pleasure in seeing them waste it). Rather than making the children the villains, they become (not quite) innocent victims--robbing the book of much of the conflict one might expect.Moreover, the last 100 pages peter to a close, without any real sense of urgency or drama.I read--and enjoyed--""The Pelican Brief."" Unfortunately, I cannot say the same about ""The Testament."""
4,Redemption,"I found this to be a very profound story of redemtion. I really like how this story evolved. It was interesting how Troy and Nate were similar; except, Troy new how to save money and Nate didn't. I felt sorry for the Phalen heirs, because they were doomed from birth. I even had some sympathy for Troy; simply for the fact, with all his wealth he was still lonely and angry."
2,"Very disappointed in "" The Testament "".","John Grisham is one of my very favorite authors, but I was disappointed in his last book and even more disappointed in "" The Testament "". Normally when I pick up one of his books I can't put it down until I have finished it. This one I started two days ago and I am having a hard time finishing it. Mary Young (RYoung7324@aol.com)"
1,This was his worst book!,"I have been a John Grisham fan since I read his first book, ""A Time To Kill,"" however, this book was a complete and total disappointment! The characters were uninteresting, and the plot was boring and dull. He spent numerous pages on an unexciting portrait of an alcoholic, even more pages on unentertaining details about the Brazilian jungle, and I found myself skimming or skipping pages altogether. The only reason I finished this book was because I kept thinking that somewhere along the way he might redeem himself. However, that never happened. I would have given it a half of star if it were possible! It was a total waste of my time!"
1,"I thought it would be good, but . . .","Looked like a good book on the stand, but when I started reading I was shocked. I kept on falling asleep when I was reading it, now I don't know if this is my problem or the book. But, anyway, it was to big. Who is this JOhn Grisham guy anyway, in my day we read some good Mark Twain. I'm not a lawyer, it should be written so that people who aren't lawyers can comprehend the big words."
1,Huge disappointment. Weak story and weak characters,"I have read all of Grisham's books. This one, in my opinion, is not of the same caliber as previous books. The characters are weak. There does not seem to be a clear direction for the story line. It is like the author has been ""reborn"" and this is an attempt to incorporate these beliefs into a best selling novel. I will certainly wait before purchasing his next novel until readers have shared their opinions."
1,Great premise with no conclusion,You know from reading other John Grisham novels that he knows a lot about Memphis. And after reading this that he must have vacationed and been impressed with Brazil. All well in good. He convinced me that Brazil is a lot more than a square on a map. But what the hell happened to the story. The book has a great and typcially terse worded exciting beginning. From there on it is all downhill. In fact practically nothing is tied together and answered in this disappointing novel. The premise is great but what happened to the rest of the story. Maybe this is the 1st part of a series of over-blowen short stories. Mr. Grisham can be forgiven this one because of the great entertainment he has provided over the past few years. But he might consider taking a little more time and thought on the next one..and maybe someday he will write the finish to this one.
4,Those rich with children or with rich parents should read.,"John Grishan's books are the best material for teaching comparison literature. The reason? He is one of the few authors who study hard. From his first book, Time to kill, all verbs he used present tense, to his seventh book, The Partner, he used seven times of ""They found him..."" to start a paragraph. This is just amazing, not everyone can use the rhetoric repetition like Winston Churchill once used during the WWII, when he said:"" We shall fight..."" for more than seven times. And now, Testament. Five million population of original Indians,in Brazil's Amazon, after the culture invasion of the western countries, after five centuries, no more than one tenth of a quarter of a million left. Readers of Grishan's books, John is trying to tell us something, think, think hard. The writer of the above text is an interpreter and translator, who's read every book John has written."
3,Won't make a very good movie...,This is not one of Mr. Grisham's more enthralling tales. And the worst part is that it probably won't even make a good movie. I think this may be John Grisham's first made-for-TV project.
2,Not one of his better efforts,I am a huge fan but this book was definitely not one of his better efforts. I thought that there were too many characters and that he should have just picked a few of them and really focused in on them. I wanted to understand Rachel better and read more from her viewpoint and not just speculation of her feelings. The first few chapters were excellent but things went downhill from there. I only continued reading it because I wanted to give it the benefit of doubt and hope that it would get better. It didn't. The ending was very disappointing. I hope that the next book is more like his older ones.
2,"I don't know why I still keep reading John Grisham's book,","I got disappointed every time I read John Grisham's new book. On the book jacket, it even misguide the nature of the book. ""... Returning to the real world is always difficult, but this time it's going to be murder."" Unless I misunderstood what the word ""murder"" means, I found no murder or even close to murder in this book. It's a straight forward story about distributing an estate, and finding the rightful heir. There is no suspense, nor is any murder mystry involved. The scene of Brazil and the life of tribes are only skin deep at the best. I'm disappointed."
2,Formula writing with a slight variation,"Other than great descriptions of Brazil, totally predictable. Alcoholic goes to the jungle, sees the light, changes his life. Ho-hum. Try again, John."
3,Different from norm for Grisham,"Before writing this review I took a minute and read some of the others printed here, and found a wide array of opinions. My opinion falls on the ""disappointed"" side. You know how you start to watch a TV program and by the time you realize it isn't all that great, you're too involved in it to change the channel? That's how I felt with this book. At some point I realized that I wasn't really enjoying it, yet I was just interested enough to finish it. I really enjoyed Grisham's other brief foray into Brazil, in The Partner, and the parts of The Testament which take place in Brazil are also pretty interesting. But the rest of this book is a little belaboured by all the characters the reader has to keep up with, and the underlying story is not at all upbeat. In the end, there is no real vindication, no triumph of good over evil, no huge upset for which Grisham's other novels have come to be known."
3,Exciting book with a terrible ending,"The book itself was excellent, and has an interesting story line to work off of. It was the usual good, exciting John Grisham read. The ending was terrible! It gave me the impression that Mr. Grisham has perhaps gotten bored of the story and just wanted to finish it up as quickly as possible! But, all in all, it was worth reading once--and ONLY once."
2,A Testament to a dying plot,"At time of writing, I'm the 610th reviewer of this book. SO , I wont be long in judging it. First 100 pages: 5 Stars, brilliant desciption of most members of the Phelan clan Cue to Brazil: 1 star, A sub tropical yawnathon Climax: 2 stars, so predictableWill I read ever read Grisham again ? HE is human after all...THis book shows it..he is entitled to mistakes"
2,Something is missing...,"...namely, ""a woman pursued by enemies and friends alike"" holding ""a stunning surprise of her own."" This text was on the back cover of the book and I thought it would be more suspensful than it was. No enemies in pursuit, no stunning surprise. Yawn.Nate O'Riley was likeable and the descriptions of Brazil were colorful. This is good beach or airplane reading."
3,A mediocre book from Grisham,"The book starts with a gripping storyline but then it drags on. The ending is obviously a rush and lacks the exciting pace that Grisham used to have, like in Runaway Jury. Well, at least it's better than The Street Lawyer. Read it only if you have time."
4,The Testament,This was my first Grisham book to read. I knew by reading the first page that I was hooked and unable to put it down. I would highly recommend it.
3,writer,John went ti the spiritual side of his feelings this time. We need more of that from our famous writers. Good Job!
4,Really liked it,I really liked this Grisham even though it was not as suspenseful as some of the others(Pelican Brief is my fav). I liked the characters and hated some of them. I thought the story was interesting and real.
3,Did Not Meet My Expectations,"John Grisham started with an interesting story, he just didn't follow it all the way through until the end. I expected much more from him, as I have loved his other books.The jungle part of the book had me intrigued, although it was a bit slow. The law part was confusing- too many lawyers and children to keep straight. The character development was weak- no one had any depth except for Nate O'Riley, and he was superficial.If you're a John Grisham fan, you will read the book no matter what I or anyone else says (like I did!!) If you are just discovering him, I recommend that you start with one of his other books."
3,Loved the bit about the igloo,"We got this one on tape from the library. I've enjoyed some of the other novels, but with this one I found myself only mildly interested in what was going to happen. Clever moments were few. We got a big kick out of the lady who was supposedly born in an igloo in Newfoundland. What a hoot!"
3,Great beginning...no follow through,Disappointing read from a favorite author. Great premise..beginning but crawled to the end.
2,"One of my favorite authors, John Grisham, strikes out.","John Grisham, one of my favorite authors, has struck out with this one. I really had to force myself to keep reading until the end. I hated being mired down in the dreary effort the main character went through to attempt to meet his ultimate goal.A few months later I read ""The Codicil"" by Tom Torpor written in 1993, which is a superior book in every way. I would give it 10 stars! Same premise as ""The Testament"" but much better done.I will, of course, read Grisham's next book. Maybe he just needed to take a breath and build up some steam."
4,"The Prodigal Son, or maybe a lost sheep","Like many others have stated, I enjoyed the plot of a fallen and lost man coming to find Christ. However, Grisham has got to work on his endings. I've read five of his books now, and the last three (The Partner, The Street Lawyer and The Testament) have just had the most ridiculous and unsatisfying endings. They are so inconsistent with reality, not to mention many of the people in his books remove themselves from character in the last 20 or so pages."
2,Yucky!,"I haven't read Grisham's books for a few years, so I was probably 12 or 13 when I read the likes of ""The Firm."" I loved his books back then, but I found this to be generally a boring book. It's written for a reader with below-average intelligence or reading skills, the characters (mostly the heirs) are flat and boring, it's WAY too long. Besides some interesting parts (like in Brazil), it's generally just not that good. If I'm reading a book I really like, I'll finish it in a few days. But this book took me almost a month, not because it's hard, but because it almost felt like a chore. I wanted to finish it, but I didn't really want to sit down and plow through it, after about the third day. Don't waste your time. And that Publisher's Weekly review is dead wrong. If he's following in the footsteps of Dickens, the world is a sad place."
4,Good reading!,"You may call me a John Grisham 'habitué', since I usually buy each new novel written by him even if the subject doesn't intrigue me very much. While the last two novels- the Partner and the Steet Lawyer- were as far as I'm concerned extremely disappointing, the Testament was quite good. The combination of adventure and high court drama is very enjoyable. Even the end of the book was very touching and not as expected as the last two novels. However, I believe that the sudden change in the main character behaviour and way of living is not very convincing. Does Grisham try to portray his own life through this lawyer? From a low life lawyer, most of the time drunk and unconscious, the main character becomes almost a Saint... Too bad that Grisham tend to embrace such old 'clichés'. Despite that, the book is very entertaining...Enjoy the reading!"
3,"I enjoyed this book alot, great ending","I thought this book was great, but not as good as ""The Street Lawyer"". The ""Testament"" would make a great movie, with alot of adventure and many story lines to keep people watching. Great ending who would of thought!!!!! I can not wait for the next Grisham."
3,"FIRST JOHN GRISHAM BOOK, IT WAS ALRIGHT","This was my first John Grisham book. My parents had raved about the book, and basically shoved it into my hands. I like John Grisham movies, so I said what the heck. It was an enjoyable book, but it was nothing great, and really wasn't that close to greatness. It passed the time with some entertainment, much like tv. But, I would rate most of Tv either at a 3 or below, so there is my take on this book."
2,Obsess Much?,"John Grisham has written a novel with almost no sympathetic characters. There's a huge amount of money to be divided up by an eccentric billionaire...all of his relatives are greedy, almost worthless human beings. Nate, the guy sent to find one last heir, is a recovering alcoholic/drug addict...I personally didn't care who got the money, but John Grisham really seems to be obsessed with large amounts of money. Grisham's books are typically page turners, but this one was a tough one to plow through."
4,Grisham has returned to respectable writing,"Grisham has published a series of so-so novel since his early works. ""The Testament"" was nearer his entertaining style than the tremendously uninteresting ""Street Lawyer"". We'll see if he can keep it going..."
1,Too many characters and not a good story line,"I was very disappointed in this latest novel by Grisham. It just dragged on and you got to the point where you didn't even care who got the money. Although there were many characters he never really built any of them up, you only got bits and pieces of each person. It was a waste of time to read. If you are new to Grisham try his earlier books, The Client, Time to Kill, The Firm, The Pelican Brief because that is when he was at his best."
1,Couldn't Wait to Put It Down,"Three quarters of the way through Grisham's latest, I could not wait to be finished with it. The plot was totally predictable. Unlike his previos novels where unforgetable characters take the reader throught a plot full of surprises, this novel takes the reader along a path of how a drunk lawyer who has nothing left but the promise of yet another drunken crisis, finds God. After reading three fourths of the book, frustrated, I scanned the remainder.....and, indeed, it was as predictable as I had imagined. Not even a good surprise ending."
1,THE FIRST 100 PAGES,THE OPENING WAS A GOOD IDEA FOR A STORY. I WAS VERY INTERESTED. ABOUT HALFWAY INTO THE BOOK I WAS GETTING NERVOUS. I WAS RIGHT. WHAT A LONG DRAWN OUT AFFAIR IT WAS. NOT UP TO PAR FOR THIS WRITTER.
1,The Testament,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read! It is a very slow read with characters I could not come to like and/or care about. I usually enjoy John Grisham novels, so I kept reading in hopes of a twist, a burst of action, an interesting character...anything to turn around the reading experience....but it continued to be a bore the entire way through. I believe Mr. Grisham put some words to paper just so he could write-off a trip to Brazil, a major setting in the book. I only gave one star because the system forced me to select at least one star."
3,Mediocre,"This was a summer reading choice for incoming juniors in high school. My 16 year old did not choose it but I decided to read it since it was on the list. I am really surprised that it was on a high school reading list. I knew Grisham's books from the past and found them generally escapist and entertaining, but gave them up after reading four or five.I love long books, but for some reason I found this one too long. I finished it because I wanted to know the ending. Congrats since I did not predict it! Overall, though, it was not a satisfying read for all the time I put in.One of the main characters is a missionary, so I expected some religious overtones, but the writing came off as contrived and forced in that respect. Just ok."
3,A bit of a slow reader,"First, I'm not much of a lawyer book fan although I do like the grisham movies. About the middle of this book I wondered if I ever would finish it but did not dislike it enough to stop reading. It sped up after I got through the middle and it was ok. Not sure why I have such a hard time with these books, whether it is the lack of human development or the mass amount of detail. It had an ok story though and is a readable book.A lawyer is getting out of rehab and is facing IRS issues so his firm sends him to the jungle to find an evangelist that just inherited millions despite the fact that she is an unknown illegitimate child of the miserly man that just died."
2,"Can you say ""BORING""","This is my seventh Grisham book and by far the most boring book I have read in a long time. So slow that I have decided to quite reading and I am almost finished. (I have never done that before) I am bewildered to all the 5 star ratings it has recieved. The Partner was a 5 star book. The Street Lawyer was a 5 star book. This is boring, slow and I did not enjoy this book. Sorry John."
2,Starts with a bang but well........,One of the reviews on the cover of the book says something like the best first 50 pages ever written...well this statement certainly holds good..the book starts with a bang and you rush through the first 50 pages but then what happens..we are taken through a tour of brazilian wetlands and the book alternates between america and the adventure in the brazilian wetlands :-( to find the missing heir.Skip the portions of the supposedly brazilian adventure and read through the rest of the book...so out of the 500 odd pages the 250 pages are pure grisham stuff thats why 2 stars and the rest a big yawn...hoping that the next book of grisham 'The Brethren' will be a good read.
2,I keep falling into the Grisham trap,"Every time I fall into the Grisham trap. I loved his first three books. I had my doubts about The Client and was really disappointed with The Chamber. It never really got better after that. Good beginnings of the books, but the endings have been a real anti climax ever since The Chamber. The Testament is better than the previous two or three books of which I do not even remember the titles. I guess it isn't a coincidence that his books haven't been made into movies after the first four books. Or were the movies even worse than the book. I do not think I will buy the bretheren."
2,Very marginal effort,"I was very disappointed in this book. I think John Grisham has reached a point in his career (like Steven King) where he realizes that he can sell books without really putting a lot of effort into them. This book like Steven King's Bag of Bones could have used a lot of editing to cut out the ""filler."" The problem with that is if the editor had cut out what really wasn't really an integral part of the book, there would probably ahve been less than a 150 pages."
2,BORING!!!!,"This was the most boring book written by John Girsham that I have ever read and I have read all of his books. I skipped most of the pages wehre character Nate was in the jungle. I could have done without all of that description. I hated the ending. Without giving the ending away, I thought the settlement was unfair.I have read everyone of John Girsham's books and was inspired to complete law school. I was disappointed to read The Testament. It was nothing like the rest of his books."
1,Miserable Sop to Fundamentalist Christians.,"Even though, it's not great writing, the plots are usually interesting and entertaining. But this was an astonishingly, embarassingly transparent effort to sell books to logic-impaired Christians. I'm sure it will sell books, but Grisham should be ashamed of himself. YUCK."
2,The Testament,"The Testament starts out very well, with an excellent idea: an old man, disgruntled with his children, makes a will giving his 11 billion to a illegitimate child who lives in the jungle. The lawyers for the children of the recently deceased all fight to get money out of the will. Meanwhile, Nate O'Riley goes into the jungle of South America. Unfortunately, I like the law more than I like escapades into the jungle. It just took too long in the middle of the book to keep me interested in the law part. I grade books by how long it takes me to read them and be interested: this one took me 5 days. Every other grisham i have read took me 1. I think this is his worst novel, but he made a strong comeback with The Brethren."
3,Average,"Average Grisham. Not much more to say. His books all seem pretty much the same. In this case, the best part of the book is the first couple of chapters, after that it's downhill."
3,Better than recent efforts.,"I have read all of Grisham's books and generally enjoy his style and content. Most of his fans will enjoy this book, but I don't think it was his best effort. The book was unevenly paced, cartoonish at times, and ended rather abruptly without bringing the story to an end. I would like to see Grisham fewer books, but go back to the things that made The Firm and A Time to Kill superior reads."
3,Refreshingly different,"I looked through some of the reviews and it seems as though die hard Grisham fans were a little let down by this book because it wasn't ""compelling"" like the others. I have been a Grisham fan from the beginning and my favorite book still stands as A Time to Kill. I have enjoyed his other books but they all seem to follow the same formula - a person in some sort of trouble, a twisting plot that raises the blood pressure, and they all make out in the end and go live on some paradise island somewhere with millions. I found The Testament refreshing because it was different. It was a slower paced book, weaving a story and spending more time on the passing details"
4,"Interesting, Original","An intriguing mix of secularism and religion. Moralistic but not preachy. This story, while having an ending that is slightly predictable, has many intereting twists and turns. As one who has been on mission trips, this book is well researched and realistic. If you are the non-religious type, don't let this book scare you away. You will enjoy it strictly for the story."
4,A Fresh Look at Grisham's works!,"I'm just a teacher, not a literary critic; however, I've read all of Grisham's books and I find this one enlightening. His characters were hilarious and I know some rich heirs that act just like he stated. I also have a tremendous amount of faith in God and when Rachel Lane teaches Nate to pray - chills overcame me. I do believe that people who have been through rehab four times can change. Once again the ending was very unexpected like The Partner, which is one of my favorites. I hope you liked this one as much as I did. I thought Josh Stafford was a great, trusting friend. I hope I am that lucky."
3,"Decent, not his best","I labored a bit thru this Grisham effort. It starts off with a bang and very interesting premise that really gets sidetracked. It rallies late, but only enough for me to award 3 stars."
2,Thoroughly Predictable!,"Neat opening and a concept he could have done wonders with! But alas after the first 50 pages, the book just loses all its substance. It then becomes an extremely predictable narrative of what's already on the back cover. More like reading a bloated version of a newspaper article! You really don't miss anything if you skip through the 200 odd pages in the Brazilian forest. Certainly *not* the riveting page turner, some reviewers claim it to be. Way below Grisham's caliber. In fact, its not even in his class!"
2,Lukewarm,"For me, John Grisham runs hot or cold. Testament is ""Lukewarm"". I did not find the behavior or character of the ""heirs"" to be believeable. A disappointment after ""The Street Lawyer"" which I loved."
3,This is the first Grisham book I read,"and I have to say I was very disappointed. It was difficult to find an actual protagonist in the book. It seemed to me that the book was actually about the will, instead of about a person. A lot of time was spent on descriptions of the surroundings, as opposed to an actual plot. Several chapters, in fact, were spent on describing the rainforest, which I felt was unnecessary. I agree with the previous reviewer in regards to the religion that was portrayed in the book. It seemed to be contrived; almost as though that was what the book was supposed to be about, then later Grisham changed his mind but retained most of the content. It took a lot for me to get through this book, but maybe I'm just a fan of Grisham's movies, and not his books."
2,Lost interest quickly...,"John, what have you done? This book started off great with an awesome plot. But after about 75 pages I couldn't take it anymore and stopped reading. This is my 3rd Grisham novel, and it is NOT a good representation of his other works. I have also read The Street Lawyer and The Client. Those two were 150% better than what I read of the Testament."
3,Partying vs. Peace,"Surrounded by cynical, self-absorbed, and shallow people, the main lawyer chooses a path which leads him away from that existence to a more meaningful one. If asked the question, ""What are the most important things you do?"", the lawyer would originally have answered something like,""Sue people, party, get laid, and get the best time I can out of this miserable existence."" At the end of the book he is at peace and has a reason for living. Since I went through that same process in my life I found this aspect of the book interesting."
4,Easy Read and Entertaining,"If you like John Grisham's books, you will like The Testament. Nate O'Riley makes the story accessible and light. (You can connect with this character easily.) You also learn a little about probate law. John Grisham's writing style is consistenly pleasant in The Testament."
4,Grisham and Beyond,"""The Testament"" has all the elements Grisham fans will remember from his earlier books--legal finagling, large sums of money, a likable hero under a lot of pressure. But the plot gets us out of the USA to Brazil and involves us in some fascinating eco-sleuthing. Gripping and fun from beginning to end. I like this new Grisham, the ""world citizen,"" even better than I liked the old one."
2,"Excuse me, your moralism is showing.","Grisham has built his reputation on the superb suspense of ""The Pelican Brief,"" ""The Client,"" and ""The Firm."" ""The Testament"" is the first, but not the only one, of his books that I find distasteful because he has begun to show an unflattering tendency to moralism. I want Mr. Grisham to entertain me, not to instruct me. This novel is spoiled by an alcoholic lawyer who meets a missionary, then travels the long, long road to god and redemption on the reader's dime. If I want inspiration, I will seek it out. The book did not give me the wonderful reading experience that the first three did."
2,A good writer--a mediocre book,John Grisham has written some terrific books. This is not one of them. The plot fizzles and the characters do not have the complexity of those in his better novels.
5,Grisham is growing,"The editorial review concluding classic Grisham is shortsighted. The venture into the Patanal is a new foray for Grisham, one that adds a welcome touch of Mitchner or Crichton. Frankly, after his first four books, I concluded Grisham had become too pedestrian for consideration. My good friend gave me this book for Christmas and I am more than pleasantly surprised at the increase in scope. His handling of the relationship between the missionary and the lawyer was stirring; and the personal growth thereafter of the lawyer, miraculous. I loved this bit of very positive mixed with the negative of the inheritance squabble. It allows the reader to reevaluate his/her own values."
4,It's About Time,"I can't tell you how it feels to see an established author deal with the subject of Christianity. In a world where everything revolves around money and status, this books gives a perspective not often seen. I have found it is a great tool in witnessing to people about the love of Jesus Christ."
2,The Testament,"Did not care for this book at all. Plot was slow, not interesting, put book down, never did finish reading it, skipped to end."
5,Christians Understand,"After reading several of Grisham's books, I was pleased to read this new book that unfolds the spiritual side of the master author. I will assume that this will be one book that probably most fans will not enjoy nor understand. Until someone has experienced the Grace that Jesus Christ has to offer will they comprehend the religious concepts in this book: Money doesn't matter. Callings on Lives. Purity and Happiness. Eternal Value of Life and Works. Faith in Jesus. Grisham has created a classic that will appeal to those who have met Christ as their personal saviour. Still, I recommend this book for Christians and Non-Christians alike. It is well written, and although it drags in some places, overall, it's a winner. A life transformed by Jesus is not a flaw in character development. It is a true reality that millions know about. Life with Christ is an endless hope. Life without Christ is a hopeless end..."
4,Much better than I would have expected,"I'm not a big fan of the mainstream prolific writers, who seem to have one good book, and then publish a new one every 4-6 months, with none of the new ones nearly as good as the first. Rightly or wrongly, I put Grisham in this category for the most part, having loved The Firm, then so-so on the next few.I picked The Testament up off a shelf at a fishing lodge in Northern Quebec, where I found myself disappointed with the books I had taken with me. I had a day early in the trip, which was rainy, windy, and cold, and having just recovered from an ear infection, I decided to stay in for the day. Picked this up on a whim after breakfast, and found myself still reading it at lunchtime. Finished it the next day. Although, another legal theme, this books story was quite off beat, and absolutely enjoyable reading. Loved it."
4,Good one!,"I stopped reading John Grisham a few years back, but several people recommended this one. So I tried again. I thought the book was very good. Good character development. Nice insight to Christianity without being preachy or insulting to Christians. The ending was a little disappointing, but I think it was very appropriate - everyone got what they deserved. It's worth a read."
3,BERRY MOTOWN AND ME,"I have been fascinated with Berry Gordy, Motown and it's stars since childhood, but not until I read this book, did I see another side of this successful man. In all the years I have followed Motown and heard snipets about her existence, I had no idea what an important role this author, wife played in the success of Motown.This book also, for me, placed a human side to Berry Gordy and not the myth and mega businessman.This book also told, what I believe is the real story about the stars and artist who help build ""Hitsville USA"".I recommend this book to all Motown, Gordy fans. It's fascinating and informative as well as a 60's history lesson.Bravo to Raynoma Gordy Singleton for her honesty and humor."
4,Whoa!,Just about every book written by people from Motown have painted Berry Gordy as a master manipulator and this book confirms that. I doubt if everyone is telling the same lie. The only question I have is why did she keep going back to help him? I guess Ms. Singleton's case is demonstration of emotional battered women's syndrome.
4,A Hidden Treasure,"A few years ago, my drama instructor suggested that this play should be performed. No one had ever heard of it before, but after listening to a brief summary, everyone was practicing their Irish accents. Through sheer luck, I was cast in the play (as Christina)and today I still cannot put the script down, it is that good. The cast size and setting is extremely small, which in this is case works really well because each character is so complex that any additional clutter would take away from the overall experience. But even if not seen performed, the script is great on its own. Although the plot is almost depressing, Friel mixes enough subtle humor and wit that the play does not loose any of its energy. This is a play that really should be made known to many more people."
4,Short and Sweet,"I had to read this for a theatre class, and it turns out that I loved it. It's a glimpse into a life we wouldn't normally know, and Brian Freil gives us the opportunity to embrace these characters. If you're looking to deepen the meaning of your life, start with learning and experience something new. Try this."
4,This book will make you buy more from Amazon.com...,"This book will make you buy more from Amazon.com. I picked it up at a bookstore and immediately sent off for the other two in the series. I'm also looking for the earlier ones he wrote. Combine Stephen Hunter's Bob the Nailer with Travis Magee and you've got a character with a lot of literary miles left in him. The plots are a bit preposterous, but the research and reality are there."
2,At Hitler's Side,"A somewhat disappointing book. As Hitler's Luftwaffe Adjutant, Von Below hade an insider view of the Fuhrer's wartime entourage. The book is very light on details, a superficial overlook of Von Below's experiences. This is a fatal flaw for a book of this type. I wanted to know what someone who was there saw and heard. The casual information provided is available from a zillion other sources. It is perhaps understandable. Von Below's notes taken at the time were destroyed. He reconstructed details from memory for the book. Unfortunately, it does not make for an informative, interesting read."
4,The story of Hitler's Air Force Aide.,"Von Below was Hitler's Luftwaffe aide. He details his story through the war years at Hitler's side. Von Below is somewhat self serving here as he tries to portray he had Hitler's ear on many important matters such as equipment and personnel. Perhaps he did, or maybe Hitler used him as a sounding board. It is interesting to read the revelations on Hitler's inner circle. Nothing new in facts are proved by his story. However, we get a better idea on how Hitler functioned during the war years.Historians will find nothing new in this story. Hitler is portrayed as a hypocrite when he hears about the Katyn Forest Massacre of Polish officers and says that one should expect that from the Soviets. This was during the time when his soldiers and SS were massacring millions. As stated, the author inflates his contribution to Hitler's decisions. Otherwise, this is a nice read."
5,This is awesome!,"I have been using this like crazy once I figured out how to make it work. I have an older FoodSaver and the hose wasn't staying connected well. I tried all the different suggestions of other reviewers and none of them worked. I even called FoodSaver and they told me they thought my motor was old and tried to sell me a new one! (Very annoying!) I finally pushed the hose down where it connects to the Food Saver while I was sealing jars and it worked! Even though I had twisted the end of the hose on like instructed, it still wasn't getting a good connection. But now it works and I love it!"
3,Deceiving Image,The accessory hose is NOT included in the package. You will have to purchase it separately. I really hope Amazon will change the description so others won't have to unnecessarily wait.
4,This is one of two things they make that is not junk,"I have been through 3 foodsavers and none lasted very long. The seals and the pump are junk on all of them. Their canisters don't last more than a month. The mason jar sealers, all purpose jar sealers and the hose and the roll holder are all that do what they are suppose to do.Save your money a little longer and get a Professional Marketing group vacupack or vacupack lite. It can suck in moisture and keep working and their seals are better the hose connection is better. The sealer is a bar not a wire which makes for a better seal. The non-stick coating is not taped on but part of the sealer assy. The last few months of my foodsaver that stupid Teflon strip kept falling off or sticking to the bag."
1,What a piece a crap!!,"Nice....sealed two jars, and then stopped working! I tried ever suggestion on this site, and NOTHING works. Really, $5.00/each to seal two jars. Really NOT worth it. Save your money and buy some oxygen absorbers instead."
5,large mouth jar sealer lid,I had purchased a small mouth jar sealer lid in the past and use it all the time. I needed one for my large mouth canning jars that I put in dehydrated foods into. This works great. Highly recommend these.
5,Works as advertised.,"Not sure why but the Wide-Mouth Jar Sealer works, the Regular one does not.36 jars so far, and counting."
5,"ready salad, everyday","I use this wide mouth sealer on quart jars of mixed salad greens. They will last up to a week in my fridge and make it so easy for me to ""grab and go."" My sealer is used all the time and works perfectly with my Foodsaver. I highly recommend this product."
5,A great add-on for your FoodSaver!,"It's no secret that the bags for the FoodSaver are expensive. Enter the Wide Mouth Jar Sealer. This is great for items that you want to keep vacuum sealed in between uses. Think ""dry goods"" such as beans, macaroni, corn starch, brown sugar, etc. For those that are not familiar with exactly what this does I will give a brief expanation. With this jar sealer you can take a standard canning jar, put the desired product inside, slap on a good canning jar lid, and vacuum seal it using the 'canister' button and the vacuum hose that came with your FoodSaver. You then remove the jar sealer to use again and again. As long as you are careful when removing the canning jar lid it can be used over and over again. The companion product to this is the Regular Mouth Jar Sealer which is the same but for regular mouth jars."
4,It works with Seal-a-Meal brand,"I was apprehensive to purchase this produce because I wasn't sure it would work with Seal-A-Meal Brand food saver. IT DOES WORK quite well! We immediately started sealing extra almonds, pecans, walnuts, coffee, etc. into Ball jars to help keep the items fresh until we need them."
5,amazed,"amazedThis product was the biggest surprise in a long time. It actually works! I thought I would have to buy special jars or at least special lids. I couldn't believe all I would need was a ""sucker"" and my old canning jars. It is going to save me soooo much money in freezer bags and I can stay ahead of the pantry moths."
2,THE HOSE DOESN'T COME WITH THIS PRODUCT,"Beware - no hose!I bought this,FoodSaver T03-0023-01 Wide Mouth Jar Sealernot for the jar sealer itself but to buy the pictured hose (We need the hose, but no found alone). The hose doesn't come with it, so don't expect it (and Amazon - pls say ""hose not included"")."
1,No tube included,"I haven't used it yet, but wanted people to know in advance that the tube is not included with this product. Our foodsaver was a display model and didn't include the manual or the accessories so I don't know if a tube comes with the machine and that's why it's not included with the jar sealer? Now I'm searching everywhere to see if I can find a tube. Amazon doesn't appear to sell one."
1,Food saver wide mouth jar sealer,I am extremely disappointed that it did not come with the hose. For what it costs it should come with the hose without it seems more like a rip off!
2,FoodSaver T03-0023-01 Wide Mouth Jar Sealer,will not work on most wide mouth jars...it is more trouble than it is worth
4,Jar sealer really works,"I got both the regular and wide mouth jar sealers and I use them a lot. I put leftover green salad in a jar and sealed it! Not a speck of brown on any of it. Just as fresh as the day it was made! Also did the same with fresh fruit, such as apricots and sliced peaches. Just great! You must have the right jars in order for it to seal, however. They have to be the newer canning jars, which have a slight rim just below where the ring screws on. I have some older jars that have no rim, and the sealer doesn't fit snuggly on them. Also, one older qt. jar had too large a rim. This is a great way to keep food from spoiling before you can use it up!"
4,Works great for keeping lettuce and veggies fresh longer!,"I bought this on a recommendation I saw in a blog, to preserve lettuce and other green veggies longer, and so far it has worked great. All I do is pack a quart size jar full of my leafy greens and let the FoodSaver jar sealer do the rest. This gives me a lunch-sized portion for every day of the week with no browning, wilting or moisture.Well worth the money for the attachment and extra jars. I am sure I have already gotten my investment back from the decrease in produce wasted."
5,Great item!,"I like this item. Allow you to use regular jar to keep food.The thing to know is that you are in fact using the jar lid to seal the jar. One wide-mouth jar sealer allows you to vacuum many jars!The wide-mouth jar sealer is there to vacuum the jar while the lid is seating on the jar. When the vacuum is completed, you remove the wide-mouth jar sealer. The jar lid stays in place because of the negative vacuum pressure created inside the jar. You can screw the jar lid bands on to complete the process. Now you can start over on another jar!As recommended when canning, I guess it is best to soften the jar lid rubber seal in hot water to improve the efficiency of the seal and vacuum retention."
5,Handy and Quick to Use,"Product is easy to use and takes very little time. Lids can be reused over and over to seal the same jar again or another. Overall, I'm very pleased."
3,Works good when it works,"I've got a few of these just because they come with many different accessory kits. It seems the rubber seal in them wears out and it doesn't grab the glass anymore when the FoodSaver is turned on. Other than that, it is nice to be able to use jars to seal stuff in!"
