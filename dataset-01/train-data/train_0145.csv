1,Don't Fall for it!!!,"Image shows Purple HI TOPS, but when you order....you get LO tops. Also, items that say 'qualifies for super saver shipping!' they're not. So unless you are ok with lo tops when you want hi tops...don't fall for it!"
1,Not what we ordered!,We ordered the Chuck Taylor All Star Hi-Tops with the white soles and laces. What we received was the all black shoes. That's not the picture that went with the order we placed.
3,No arch!,I liked the shoe because of it's support to my ankles but it doesn't do to much if you have flat feet.
4,"Ok Fit, no support, nice for loafing around","Originally went for 15s as I usually wear a 14 1/2 or 15, but this was way way too big. Got the 14's instead and they are actually a little long in the toe. Absolutely no support in these shoes at all, not that I was really expecting any. Just wanted to try them out. They are great as far as outfitting goes...they go with anything. But, do not plan on doing any major hiking in them. They are casual shoes and are for just that...being casual! Overall not a bad shoe though!"
1,Not the shoes I used to wear.,"I purchased Converse Chuck Taylor All Stars because they were strong durable shoes. However, these shoes started to come apart less then three weeks after purchase. The eyelets tore loose from the canvass material, I was shocked and in disbelief. Never in years past do I remember any shoe coming apart in so little time. Maybe just this pair was manufactured incorrectly? Now I have the joy of sending them back. I did hear from the company who sold them to me through Amazon although as yet they have not responded to my basic questions, not sure why the hesitation. I am sure we will get through this but in the mean while I am without footwear."
4,Great shoes quick service,Good and quick. Love the shoes although it was a bit confusing whether it was hi top or not as it showed up differently on my order form. But it was hi-tops and I'm happy :-)
1,I'm not an expert but I think they're super fake,"I don't know. They look weird, the sole's soooo different from my other converse!!! Buuu"
1,Awesome shoe... poor service,"I was pretty disappointed with the store when I opened the shoe box and found two right shoes in different shades of blue. It took some time but they did refund me for the purchase and told me to throw the shoes away because they ""didn't know anyone that could use two right shoes""."
2,Ehhh...,"I ordered the 'dazzling blue' low tops because I fell in love with the color. Not to mention, they were VERY fairly priced. They came in a day early. Which, I was extremely pleased about. But, they managed to send me a size 10 in mens. I ordered a size 6 mens/8 womens. So, they are not one, not two, BUT FOUR SIZES TOO BIG. I loved the color, and the price, and the shipping time. I was extremely disappointed in the size. Four sizes is a bit ridiculous. One or two isn't as bad. For such a horrible mistake, they are NOT getting 3 stars."
1,Never will order from here again,Ordered for a Christmas gift and never received it. I do not recommend this seller. Never responded to any of my emails until after I asked for my money back.
5,Met Expectations,"Ordered these online. The first time they arrived we realized we had ordered them a size smaller than we needed. The return process was clear and simple - we mailed them back at no cost and were refunded the entire balance. We ordered the correct pair and received those in just a few days. They arrived in great condition, the right price, the right product, and in the right amount of time. No complaints, only praise for this vendor. Great job."
4,Still the champ,"A classic shoe and still my favorite after all these years. Can't beat the price either with what sneakers cost these days. I no longer use my CTs for working out, exercise, aerobics, running or anything like that and wouldn't recommend that anybody else do so either. The cushioning is the same as it used to be back in the day, which is to say there is none. But for everyday walking, hanging out around the house, or indulging in a little retro fun these really are great shoes."
5,chuck taylor hi tops,"The shoes arrived at the earliest date promised, just in time for their use in a break dance performance."
2,nike,nike bought converse. they raised the price and lowered the quality. ive been wearing chucks for 25 plus years and can say with certainty that stitching has been removed and rubber/glue cheapened. these new chinese made nike chucks fall apart fast. they are no longer a long lasting shoe. but they still look cool.
2,quite sure these are knock-offs,"Upon receiving the shoe, they look just like my other converse shoes. I expected them to be made in China. They looked real...but upon very close inspection, I noticed that the white rubber toe part is rounder and bigger. The real converses' are pointier and smaller. The material also feels cheaper. Another dead give away was the color. The navy blue in the converse stores I went into were a truly dark navy blue color. This one is more of a faded navy blue. There are tons of fake converse out there, some look almost like the real thing. I suppose you just really have to do your homework and probably not buy online unless from the actual converse website. Hey, maybe even the seller didn't know. Like I said, no one would be able to tell these are fakes by the looks of it, but I still give it a 2 becuase I paid the amount of what a real converse would cost and I think it is my duty to let other consumers know. I suppose these'll fall apart within a year."
5,Perfect,I like this product because it was not used.Good product and cheaper than the official site.that is it
1,run very large,"these shoes are classics and I can't fault the style. My son actually wore them for a wedding (with suit and all), however, they run large (long) and had to be sent back. I found them at the last minute at a local store in the right size. We ordered the 12 but he ended up buying 10.5. It cost me $12.50 to send them back so it was kind of an expensive mistake. Always get free return shipping where you order. Just saying."
1,eeeeew,if you want to be liked dont pick these there are so 5 years ago i wouldnt reccomend these to humans
1,Never received the product.,"Product never showed up. Also, never got a reply from the seller when e-mailing them. No problem getting a full refund from Amazon however."
3,"Good look, sized BIG",My 17 yr old son loved the shoe but was so disappointed how big it was. We returned it for a size smaller we r hoping this one will work.
4,It's a Chuck!,It's a Chuck Taylor through and through. Not much support but I don't care. These were for my son and he wears a custom orthotic anyway. So we just dropped it in and he was good to go. He wore these with his tux for the prom. He was stylin' and comfortable. I do recommend going up 1/2 size if you have narrow feet and a full size if you have a medium width because they run a bit short.
3,Rubies Halloween Concepts Children's Costumes Caribbean Pirate Queen - Large,"I purchased this costume with the thought I would get free shipping thru Amazon, I did not. Seller charged $8 shipping and the costume is only a piece outfit. No sword is included, that's sold seperately. The hat is a piece of netting. It's a cute costume but I really think you could get it at Walmart for less."
5,AT LAST,"This is one of my favourite film noirs, a great movie in which Welles showed the world he could do a classic Hollywood movie without going over the budget and still produce a genuine and personal masterpiece. I own two more previously released transfers of this public domain film, none of which did justice to the movie. They look like worn out VHS tapes. They are that bad. Finally, though without any extras and at a relatively high price, MGM has released what seems to be a transfer from a very good original 35 mm print, if not the original negative. The picture looks very clean and sharp, with deep blacks, and at last I can enjoy the film as Welles intended. Buy it."
4,NO STRANGER TO DVD !,"Finally, after many prior DVD releases, this new one of THE STRANGER by MGM Home Video brings a significant improvement to the video and sound quality of this Orson Wells classic. Although the END credits are a bit abrupt (I suspect the original ones may have had negative damage),and even though there are no special features or commentaries, this release has the look of a B&W original from the 40's with practically no negative blemishes. A MUST title to add to your FILM NOIR collection."
1,"Triad ""Remastered Edition"" of The Stranger is a lousy copy.","The Stranger is an interesting film, one of the better film noir of the era. This streaming version from Triad, described as ""remastered,"" is crap. Check out the other reviews. The MGM version has positive reviews."
3,Disappointing,"I am sorry to give an Orson Welles film only 3 stars, but I was sadly disappointed in it as it is not up to the standard of other fine films of his but actually seems somewhat amateurish in some places - including the ending. Another reviewer quoted both Edward G. Robinson & Welles as not being ""happy with the final result and even referred to the project as hokum."" I can understand that very well & in fact completely concur. It is interesting that Welles chose to play the role of the villain in this film but it is unfortunate that his character was not as fully developed as it should have been & the end result appeared superficial & slipshod - completely unlike the genius of Orson Welles as displayed in other films."
3,The Stranger,"For a digitally re-mastered dvd, the quality was poor: sound and picture both. I was very disappointed. I have seen this movie on tv, and the quality was better than the dvd."
2,"Interesting Photograpy, Illogical Plot","Amateurish and outdated by today's moviemaking standards, although the black and white photography with dramatic lighting is, indeed impressive. The plot, however, has very serious logical flaws which renders it to the realm of the unbelievable. Perhaps worth seeing for the nuanced performance of Edward G. Robinson--who, for some odd reason, looks exactly like Charlie Chan."
2,"Too Contrived, I Think","Edward G. Robinson is a Nazi hunter, hot on the track of one of the Big Guys. The trail leads to a sleepy college town, and don't you know it, that new German professor Orson Welles, the one that's getting married tonight to Loretta Young, he's the guy! Wow. Seems there's a few strangers around this place. Who is this Edward G. Robinson guy, asking a lot of questions? Who is this German professor guy, with his tell-tale clock obsessions? But strangest of all is the terrible over-the-top performance of Loretta Young. She starts as the happy go lucky bride, but in no time flat is popeyed and hysterical--she's starting to resemble poor Basil Rathbone in ""The Son of Frankenstein"". Maybe you should watch it anyway, if only to check out the ultra absurd clock tower climax==that's one way to wind up a movie!"
2,"Satisfactory Design, Unsatisfactory Construction","I have seen other catchers using this helmet and mask set-up with success. However, for us, on first attempted use, the snap for the top strap broke. Not impressed with the quality, nor with the foam used behind the ears, which come in direct contact with player's skin instead of having a wicking fabric cover. Seller is providing replacement strap at no charge, after which we will see!"
3,How Smedley Butler saved America!,"If you are interested in Smedley Butler, don't miss the book The Plot to Seize the White House by Jules Archer."
1,Too similar to Wong Kar-wai,"This film tries very hard to look smart, but the effect might be sadly the opposite. Clearly this film is inspired by Wong Kar-wai, but it is too overshadowed by Wong, especially Wong's CHEUNG-KING EXPRESS. To say this film is a copycat might be not just, but to say this film is brilliant is also not proper. Or we can say this film shows how Asian American (artists) are anxious with their cultural/nationalistic/ethnic identities. However, sadly, this film is not smart enough to explore much. Everything is on the surface. Not smart, let alone wise. The pace of the film is tedious."
5,Lovely Filthy Punk Rock,"This Album is one of my all time faves,it has a purity and clarity that didnt shine through as well on their second release hellbound and heartless,great sleasy old school guitar riffs and vicious drug fuelled high energy lyrics dominate the sound,if you like your music raw and nasty with an involving catchyness this one will keep you coming back for more and more.Do try it!"
5,A Great DVD for The Band Fans,"I bought The Last Waltz because I read that Neil Diamond was in it. Well, Neil only sang one song and I wasn't happy about that but it was a great tribute to The Band and from a lot of great Rockers. For some reason I didn't know who The Band was when I bought it. But after watching the DVD's I remembered the songs from back in the day and I was really glad that I bought it. It was a lot of fun to watch and I am sure you will enjoy it a lot if you are a fan."
4,Great for its time,"For as many years as I have been a huge fan of the classic rock era, it is hard to believe that I never purchased a copy of this album until recently. Though I have seen the movie a few times. Not just a great soundtrack to the movie, but an all encompassing retrospective of the era with so many collaborating artists. The mix quality leaves a little to be desired, but that is a reflection of the era as well. However it s a very long album and hard to listen through in its entirety in one sitting."
5,This is great!,"I have always loved this album, reminds me of the ""good old days"" ;0) back in high school and driving around listening to music."
2,What's with the rubber hubs?!?!,"Okay, this set really deserves 5 stars -- the music is fantastic, the booklet is awesome. BUT: it's time that consumers start sending a message to CD producers that stupid packaging is going to cost them ratings points. Instead of built-in plastic hubs to hold the CDs firmly in place, this set has those idiotic rubber hubs from which the CDs are easily removed, but not so easily replaced. You've got to push and wiggle and prod to seat the CDs when you're finished listening to them. I'm amazed that nobody else was annoyed by this (except for the poor guy whose discs fell out, probably as a result of the hubs). Come on, Rhino, don't do this again."
1,...,"It only comes to show you, read the fine print....I bought this with high hopes I was getting the movie. But all it is, is the soundtrack to the movie, and I thought it was the movie because it said DVD (of course it the word audio under it, in real small print) on it, but it's just an audio version of the movie. It does have photos, that are modified, with horrible quality, and it also has the lyrics to the songs, but I couldn't figure out how to get the screen to go down to read the full text of the lyrics. I am diffenitly taking this back to get a refund.. I have seen the movie before, and I really like it, but I can not endorse this product due to the fact it is very deceptive, and they even put it in the video section at the place I bought it. I just thought I would warn ya'll about it..."
2,Far too little Diamond,"I bought this set with hope and excitement, knowing that not only was I hearing a great band exit on top, but also a great singer and songwriter in his prime. And what does he get? That's right, one song. That's right - I'm talking about Neil Diamond. It seems a bit of a waste to invite the man and hardly use him. After all, how much did the Band liberally borrow from Mr. Diamond? I don't think I'm a fool for suggesting that ""The W.S. Walcott Medicine Show"" owes more than a little to ""Brother Love's Travelling Salvation Show"".Until Rhino sees fit to include more Neil (and I don't mean Young), I won't be buying this. I don't care if he only played one song at the concert, add a practice take or something.One final thought: it was the Seventies -where were Bread? Curious."
2,Buy the remastered version,"Of course, the music for this concert CD rates a ""5"", but with the remastered version out, this version (pre-2002) is shown to be very limited in its fidelity. I own this and just heard the remastered version (2003, 2-CD set) and I am blown away by the high quality of the remastered Last Waltz. If you love The Band and The Last Waltz concert, the difference in sound quality of the remastered CD is worth the expenditure."
5,Awesome!,"This album is fantastic, truly a must have for any fan of the band or anyone who wants to find out what they're all about!"
5,The Last Waltz,This album is great! It has all the songs you love with great guest artist. The album is just like the concert video. I recommend you buy both the album and the DVD.
2,The Last Schmaltz,"Is there anything more sanctimonious than filming your last concert and inviting a bunch of fellow overrated hacks (Clapton, Neil Diamond, Joni Mitchell) to the occasion, as if it's some monumental event? Please! As if the Band were anything worthwhile in the first place. Sorry, but the whole concept of a bunch of Canadians (well, four of five anyway) writing this stuff about Americana always came across to me as pretentious -- and it doesn't get much worse than that stupid shot of Levon Helm wheezing through ""The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down.""These guys were just the beneficiaries of Rolling Stone/elitist rock critic propaganda. (And to think they made fun of prog bands for writing inane lyrics -- huh!) I think Martin Newell put it best when he called the Band ""dreadful bearded ghastliness."""
5,Awesome album,"As someone who has watched the Last Waltz a few times, I was walked away feeling a little empty as I saw songs cut short to exhibit the documentary side of the film. This album is the solution to that problem. You get all the music, and now I can take it on the road instead of being tied to a TV and DVD player. Strongly recommended for fans of The Band and those who like live music"
5,=),"Got this for my mom. She absolutely loves it! She had this in cassette tapes,that were getting worn out! Thanks"
3,Another Historical Occassion,"I purchased this album after I read something about Rick Danko's death in a music periodical, and recall seeing the movie. I have always loved The Band from when they started out after (Ronnie Hawkins) as Levon Helm and the Hawks, and continued through some tough times. I often wonder especially from the album Big Pink (their pad in NY) if Robbie Roberson really wrote all the songs he's credited with? Levon Helm an accomplished musician and song writer from Turkey Scratch Arkansas must have had some influence over Roberson and his music. Either way I found this album great and it spurns alot of memories from a time when music lived in The BAND!"
2,Disappointed,"The reason for my disappointment is that I thought I was buying the video of the last waltz and not just a CD with pictures. It is way to pricey for just a CD. The music is great though.However, the product was delivered before the due date and was in great condition. I would buy again from Amazon but this time I will know what it means when they say DVD - Audio"
3,Kinda repetitive,"I think there were about 100 pages too many. There was overt and implied violence that was disturbing, and the hero had anger management issues - their first kiss was really hostile. Beware - and buy used."
1,Do official critics even READ the books?,"I bought this book based on an editorial review but I sure didn't find the sparkly repartee or seething sexual tension they did. What I found instead were sexual assault and softcore porn. The ""hero"" is a brute and the ""heroine"" a spoiled whiner. Very disappointing from a bestselling author."
1,how does this get on a romance shelf?,This book is so full of rape and violence I wonder if it wasn't written by a man using a pen name. The main character gets brutally raped and then has sex with her husband in front of a group of people like in a bad porn movie. I felt like I needed a bath after this. How does this stuff ever get published as romance which is supposed to be love? Gross porngraphic and disgusting
1,Not even the sex was good!,"Brutal rape, a ""hero"" whose impossible to like, and a ""love scene"" observed by the couple's family and friends. If you enjoy this sort of thing read Sweet Savage Love instead."
4,Good Book for those interested in Appalachian Folklore!!!!,"Notice I said FOLKLORE, and that's what most of this book is (with some real magick), but the author tries too hard on implying this FOLKLORE into the reader's daily life calling it magick which is something I wouldn't reccomend considering some of the customs such as brewing tea from dog drool and the fact that it seems to me that most of it is FOLKLORE, not real magick!!!! The author also seems to add Wicca into the book too much and adds some of her own chants and opinions which I don't really think is necessary, but many Appalachian ancestors were Celtics with Pagan beliefs though. All in all it is a good book with some great information and some practical magickal ideas that you could try for yourself from the most interesting Appalachian region of the United States!"
3,Time has sort of passed this by,"The publisher says this book is for ""7 and up"". Don't see that. I'm thinking 11 or 12 and beyond.That said, I'm not entirely sure where the appeal is here. I get it that the idea is for the reader to identify with the heroine's ""teen angst"", but everything is so mild there's not much there, there. There's also not a lot of insight and the character development is pretty predictable, so I'm not persuaded that a reader will get much from the book apart from the thrill of recognition. This book came out about 15 years ago and it was probably seen as pretty cutting edge back then. Now, it seems mild and unremarkable.That said, sometimes validation and the encouragement that you are not alone is what a teen reader needs and wants, and is enough. So, I sort of think of this as a ""problem"" novel, where the problems are pretty mild. And, I certainly think there is room for teen problem novels where the problems don't include vampires and werewolves."
4,The best book ever!!!,"I thought and truly felt that Paula Danziger's, Can You Sue Your Parents for Malpractice? book was the best book ever. It was humorous and touching. I really enjoyed reading it!!!"
4,"Great product, just a little compact.","I bought this to just keep my laptop safe and sound without the scratches and to keep the cords together.It works for that, but thats about it. If you want to keep anything else with the computer, think again. The ""pouch"" is a little small in the front.Overall, if you don't plan on carrying a lot of stuff with your computer this works great. Just don't plan on a lot of room."
3,Ruins of the Reich,Ruins of the Reich is just that. It shows a lot of buildings--everything from secret bunkers to Olympic Stadiums. I'm still looking for a network tv documetary aired around about the summer of 2007? My neighbor from the Sobibor Camp is standing next to Hitler in one photo.
3,Mediocre Atlas,"Overall, this wasnt quite what I was hoping for. It was less than extremely informative, though some parts I found helpful. My advice: look somewhere else."
4,"Terrific., but up for discussion...","If you're a new fan, or just discovering these guys...this is a tough first listen as an intro to the band.That being said, however, if you're a fan of electronica, free form jazz with a bit of ambient thrown in, this works well. Very well, actually.In true MMW tradition, this CD soars in the middle with the groove (and the title track is almost perfect), but it almost invites the question: ""If you don't know us, get to know us.""The mix on the CD ..., BTW. This is one of those CD's where a ""headphone alert"" is being issued since it just sounds better that way."
3,I Don't Get It!,"It's hard to write a negative review for a band whose every new album I used to enjoy so much, and as individual musicians these guys are still sublime - always hoping Medeski will get involved in ever new projects, and preferably NOT jam-base related!I really didn't care for this album very much thought. That is until track 14, which is amazing. That's a 5 star track and easily made this album worth my picking up. But otherwise I found the funk too routine, even as MMW continue to hone their skills at integrating various sounds into it. Oh well."
5,best band in the land....,"this band never ceases to amaze me. ive seen them 4 times, saw illy b in philly with calvin g., and every time they do something different... however abstract. this is a group that has been able to emulate their original sound from recording to recording, and yet achieve something different and new every time allthewhile avoiding the perpetually vapid movement weve all come to know as 'Pop Culture'. as sad as it is that that 'movement' has brainwashed a majority of the masses, there is hope. and that hope lies in the hands of groups like mmw, artists with true visions without compromise. Uninvisible is mmw's ode to free style hip-hop and funk. and they represent. forget about Notes from the Underground, Friday and Jungle... buy them, listen to them, LOVE THEM. and love everything that came after, because its all worth listening to."
4,"Funky, better variety","MM&W adds some instruments and sounds to the mix in ""Uninvisible"", and the result is a sound that is more listenable over the length of the album. A little spice of variety is all they needed to improve. The songs are mostly funky, and the spacier stuff is very good as well."
3,So Far So Good,"I was wondering which direction these boys would go after The Dropper. I don't necessarily think they're regressing with this album, but I definately don't think they're progressing. For anyone not familiar with this band, this album is probably great. It's pretty simple and the beats are solid.Unfortunately, although I've only owned it for a couple days now, I feel I'll be sick of this soon, whereas I'm still not sick of the Dropper. Are the grooves better? Hell yeah, but there's nothing new here. This IS Medeski, Martin and Wood, when I think of them, this is what I think of.It's almost like they're saying with this album ""Hey, we're MMW, and this is what we do."" Overall, it's very pleasurable music. Tracks 1,2,5,6,10,12 and 13 are all great. Too much monotony, the Colonel has got to go. That's 0 for 2 now when MMW tries the spoken word.My order of MMW albums is now as follows:Friday AfternoonJungleTonicDropperUninvisibleCombusticationNotesShack Man..."
4,Good book but predictable,I really enjoyed this book. It was the first Justine Dare book I've read and I am defintely going to check out her others. The hero in this book was great because he was't larger than life he was scarred and that is a great twist to add to a book. Too many romances have these spectacular heros that can't live up to anyones standards in the real world. This book was a refreshing change.
2,$150 of Repairs in 5 Years,"We've had an earlier model range hood style Sharp oven for five years. We've had to replace the circuit board and it has gone through three door handles. There is no one in our household who misuses appliances, so the door handle problem---plastic that is not strong enough to withstand the pulling pressure of the door catch--- simply shows the inferior quality of Sharp parts. I've actually hoped that the oven itself would stop working so I'd have a legitimate reason to replace it; I can't bear the idea of throwing out a functioning appliance. This is why I give it 2 stars. But this machine will have cost me $150 in repairs if I replace the broken handle again."
2,It didn't last.,"We bought this from Amazon in April 2008. Great price... arrived promptly. It broke this past weekend... the light in the inside turns on, but the motor won't turn on. It has a warranty for 5 years on the Heating element, so I called 2 Sharp approved repair centers. It will cost 89.00 trip charge, just to diagnose the problem. One company applies the $89.00 to the cost of the repair, the other adds labor and parts to that.So, for our family it was not a bargain."
3,Tony Curtis and Debbie Reynolds Are Hilarious!,"Judging by the amount of reviews written here,obviously this isn't a popular film. But just in case someone actually looks up this movie,I have to let you know this is a wonderful,silly,amusing comedy. Curtis and Reynolds are perfect on-screen together. Both deliver fun performances,as does Pat Boone. Here's a good movie to watch when your a little down,and in need of a laugh. It will definitely bring a smile on your face. A little personal note:A remake followed this film some 20 years later Blake Edward's ""Switch"". But between the two I prefer this one."
5,I hope it comes out on DVD,"This has remained one of my favorite movies throughout the years. I think Debbie Reynold's delivery of her lines drags occasionally when she is acting bewildered by what she is experiencing, but the plot is so cute and Tony Curtis shines so that it makes a wonderful romantic comedy. It is definitely worth viewing if you haven't already seen it...and I hope it comes out on DVD so that I can add it to my library."
3,60's comedy to watch for fun & enjoyment!,"I remember watching this movie when it came out, and Deb at my regular video (Classic Viedo) store has been searching for it for over one year. It was a fun to watch (unbelievable) story. I would like more of the old stories to be placed on tape, less violence, killing, maybe a musical or two. Less budget movie and actors and more relaxing entertainment. Where are the movies where they live happily ever after????"
3,Cute Comedy,"I had seen the movie when it was first run, but that was many years ago. Cute fluffy comedy. I watched it this time to see who sang the title song. That was the only disappointment for me. I was hoping that they had used Bobby Darin's terrific version of the title son, but alas they did not.Debby was her wonderful self, as was Tony.If you are in the mood for some good laughs, this is for you."
1,None Delivery of Item,"The person that was to send the VCR Tepe never sent it, I still want the tape but I am reluctant to order it again.I attempted to contact the person who sold the VCR Tape, but they never responded.So what is the next step, do I reorder or what?Will"
4,toyota side mirror,I am satisfied with the product and it was a reasonable price. I will order other products for my toyota as result of this purchase.
4,urban willard cheesy and fun rat story,they used the willard Formula with black cast In current times.i think they did a Good job.i would love to see a ben version in a big sceen remake.am i The only one waiting To see The originals from the 70s to apear on dvd? please let this happen soon !!!
4,An Interesting Assortment of Wellesiana,"Obviously this isn't Citizen Kane or Ambersons or even Touch of Evil, but it's an interesting cross-section of Welles' work, some of which I'd never seen. Particularly scarce (I believe) is his guest appearance on the Herb Shriner TV Show in the Fifties. I hadn't seen that one. Also, I think they recalled the first batch and got rid of that red logo!"
2,Not what I thought it was going to be,"I bought the ring because I had seen pictures in magazines that the bar will flip over and follow the curve of your belly as you grow. I started wearing it at month 6. It never flipped and I ended up taking it out in month 8. However, it was a little bit helpful in that the gauge was smaller so I could stretch a little more and didn't end up losing the hole. Now I'm back to my regular rings and they're fine. For 7 bucks, you might as well but it's nothing glamorous."
4,From México,"Nobody thought that Ernesto Che Guevara, born in an argentinian burgeois family could develop advanced ideas in the revolutionary palaestra. A latinamerican traveller, a dreamer. Later, the great revolutionary that made a whole story in the guerilla warfare which still many leftists all over the world. Bolivia was the begining of the leggend and in the daily we can found the meaning of phrases as ""Forever until victory"". Never surrender. A book that equals a summary of guerilla tactics and the deception of 60's latinamerican politics, a sadness that never ends."
3,She does it again,Anne Murray does it again! It is a wonderful collection of her songs. I recommend it for everyone who has bought one of her albums in the past
2,It needs to be redesigned,This item was probably designed by someone that has never built a fence in their life. The wire slips off the side when you start to pull tension and is dangerous when stretching barbed wire. All it needs is one extra bend in the base plate to keep the wire from slipping off and I would have give it 5 stars.
5,One of the best Yule pressies ever,"I got this for Yule and watched it all in one day, I enjoyed it that much. After having loved the original series and the direct sequel, I was a little more wary with this, as I was with Tnechi Universe, which was a disappointment except for the final 10 episodes. The Wandereres however, is a masterpiece and worth every penny.The love story between Rune Venus and Makoto is a nice change from Ifurita, who easily steals almost every scene she is in with the television series, her character is just brilliant and refreshing. Jinnai doesn't laugh enough for my liking, and the Bugrum, like all the others are as entertaining, intreging and lovable as ever. Shame about having no Phantom Tribe, but that would have made it far to complicated. Easily a 5 star rating.Though suitable for those younger than teens, it does have some nudity so it may be worth checking first if it is bought for younger viewers."
4,A very good dictionary for designers,"Whether you're an interior, industrial or other sort of designer, an architect, or simply a design conoisseur, this book will help answer almost all your questions about designers, design houses, movements, etc. In addition to this (definitions, biographies, etc.) you'll find an abundance of very good pictures that go with most of the entries, that illustrate them very well.The only reason I give it four stars is because some topics it seems to cover with lots of detail (a good example is ""Herman Miller"") while others are left with a few lines. Yes: Herman Miller is a huge name in furniture design, but that doesn't make Gaudi, for example, any smaller."
4,This is Grable at almost her peak.,"The cover of this video says it all and just another reason why this talenten lady's memory should be remembered. If you would like to see Betty Grable on a U.S.Postage Stamp write your request and mail it to, The Citizens Stamp Advisory Committee, Room 5670, 475 L'Enfant Plaza SW Washington, DC 20260"
4,GREAT MOVIE!,"Hoping that this movie comes out on DVD soon! Saw it years ago and loved it. I don't have the movie anymore nor a VHS player. So, now just waiting for the DVD release."
3,Pedestrian backstage story of family in vaudeville.,"If you're not a Betty Grable or Dan Dailey fan, forget it. The numbers are forgettable, the story is saccharine and uninvolving. It does have going for it fine Technicolor cinematography - Oscar nominated - and Alfred Newman's lively orchestrations (OSCAR WON FOR SCORING). Costumes are lavish, especially Grable's."
2,A monotonous showbiz drama,"A perfectly dreadful song-and-dance musical starring Betty Grable as a wholesome hoofer who marries her Vaudeville partner, has kids, but still can't shake the call of the road. The plot is pedestrian and minimal, the dance routines are incredibly repetitive, and Grable's Technicolor winsomeness is a faint echo of her wartime glory days. Kind of okay, but really not. You really have to be into Grable to love this one."
1,Wesleyan Pictorial History,"This book makes a nice coffee table piece. Very impressive drawings, although some are of questionable relevance to the text they are associated with. The historical value is quite sketchy but nevertheless accurate; as far as I can tell. Would make an excellent presentation gift to a departing pastor or other member of a church."
5,Makes me feel good without the pain,"From the three Ellen Barrett DVDs, this is my favorite. Sticking with the fusion philosophy, Ellen adds weights to this workout which intensifies the flow. It was more challenging than I expected. Since I workout at home, I try to rotate my workouts as much as possible to keep things fresh. I am trying to shift away from ""beating my body up"" with high intensity workouts, but low impact workouts can be too easy when you are accustomed to HIIT type workouts. This workout makes me feel like I actually did something because I sweat. The difference is that there is no pain. The steps are simple and the moves are easy to pick up so you won't get frustrated. This is one to keep in the rotation."
5,Ellen,I really enjoy doing this workout. The weights and cardio combined with pilates just works for me. Ellen is a very good instructor. The first time I did this dvd I did not feel lost or get lost at all.
5,Pilates,"I love this Pilates workout because it has more dancing and moving and less mat work. I hate exercising, but this one is fun and it's really a good workout."
4,Crunch - Burn & Firm Pilates,I love this workout. It has high energy & keeps you going. I like the use of hand weights with the Pilates routines.
5,Excellent Workout!!,A fantastic workout by a very motivating yet down to earth instructor. I highly recommend this to anyone!
4,A good work out for people beginning weight training.,I am a fan of Ellen Berret and enjoyed her fat burning pilates. Ellen is excellent with her timing. But I feel this work out does not concentrate much on the abs and the exercises are repeated. The pace and music does not let you feel bored. You do feel the muscles working and build up a good sweat.
1,This is not a Pilates at all!,"I am a Pilates instructor and occasionally buys tapes to keep expanding my repertoire.This tape is bad. I highly recommend anyone looking to do Pilates not to buy it because there is no connection between these exercises and Pilates.Pilates is done mostly on the mat, there is emphasis on breathing, movements in low speed, connection between body and soul. . All that is missing in this tape. This is a simple calorie-burning tape, the exercises that we all see in the gym, particularly suitable for very young people that enjoy Fast movements Such as aerobics classes."
2,Disappointed!,"I was really disappointed with this video.It has bad music - weird 90's techno or something - and the ""models"" are all quite blah.It's basically the Crunch - Fat Burning Pilates but a much worse version where you do all the same moves but use some light weights while you do them. I'd rather just have a 20 minute arm work out! The Crunch - Fat Burning Pilates is EXCELLENT - great music, fun moves, etc. Stick with that one, pass on this one!"
5,I love this workout,"I love this workout for a number of reasons:1. Ellen Barrett is excellent at leading the workout.2. I have avoided traditional Pilates because I really enjoy something with a little more of an aerobic style - this constant moving routine using weights and Pilates inspired moves makes this possible.3. At the same time, as I get older, I want less ""jumpy"" style aerobics - this routine also makes this possible.4. By the end of this routine I have broken out in a full blown sweat.5. When I first started doing this routine I too thought it was repetitive, however, the more I did it - the stronger I got and now the segments fly by - although still remain challenging - and I actually look forward to this workout.6. And lastly, using this workout alone for the past 2 months (at least 4x a week - more if my schedule permits) and improving my diet, I have completely toned and reshaped my body.I highly recommend buying this DVD - Just do it!"
5,Fun cardio and pilates workout that includes your arms,"This workout is fun. I used this dvd three times a week, with a healthy eating plan to lose my last stubborn 10 pounds. Ellen is very encouraging and gives helpful cues. Ellen integrates weights in this dvd. She recommends using a set of 2 to 3 pound weights. This helps tone and define your arms at a faster rate. Remember you don't want to use a heavy set of weights (like five to eight pounds) because you will get big bulky muscles. The majority of this workout is cardio and the other part of this workout is traditional mat work. The cardio segment is not intense, but if you are out of shape you may want to start off without the weights. As you progress use the weights for a more challenging workout. I love this dvd an recommend for a cardio and pilates workout."
5,Worth every money and 40 mins,"I don't usually write reviews, but this one got me to do one. I'm new to Crunch exercise videos/dvds and Ellen Barrett. The combination is great. Very effective indeed! I go to pilates classes and I must say this dvd lives up to the pilates discipline. I never understand why some people write, ""I can't wait to do the exercise again"", now I know why. I also have Ellen Barrett's pilates dvd and it's just as good."
3,"This is pilates ""inspired"" maybe....","This video is about a lot of lunges and weights, not exactly pilates. I was looking for a pilates video, and this is more of an aerobics class. It did make my legs hurt though."
4,Good workout and coreography. Hard on knees,"Don't recommend if you have bad knees. There are some deep squats while moving side to side and my knees hurt if I do it according to the instruction. I have to modify when they do this. But other than that, I like the instructor, the music, the choreography, everything else about it. Using the weights is not difficult and is adding tone to my arm and shoulder muscles."
2,Not Pilates,"I've been going to a Pilates studio for 4 months, learning the technique and working out on the reformers. This DVD is not Pilates, it's an aerobic workout using a few of the Pilates principles. I only gave it two stars because there's some misrepresentation going on by calling it Pilates."
2,Not Pilates!,"This is Aerobics, not Pilates. It's basically 40 minutes of squats...stupid. The Crunch Super Slimdown and Pick your Spot Pilates are much closer to real Pilates and work all different areas."
5,Wow not what I expected!!,"This workout surprised me, I expected it to be very easy and relaxing. Boy was I wrong it was a great workout that really made me sweat! It was easy to follow only 30 minutes long and a great workout, I love it."
4,Good workout,"Not my favorite, but a viable Pilates workout. It uses weights, but I found another Ellen Barrett Cardio workout that does both burn fat and cardio without weights, and I like that one better. Overall, I like Ellen as a leader/instructor, and she is easy to follow and listen to."
4,Great total body workout,"this is a great cardio workout that firms your entire body. From the plies, lunges, weights and matwork, your whole body feels toned after the workout.This is great for a mom like me who's press for time. A great total body workout."
4,"Good toner, but not my favorite Ellen DVD","The main complaint I have about this DVD is the repetition! I am used to Ellen's workouts filled with variety and good music. For me, the music was too dull and monotonous. However, this does do an excellent job with both toning and burning fat (I work up a good sweat and it's low impact!) Filled with squat and plie type movements in the first 35 min, and then ends with a good mat segment. Love Ellen, but wish this DVD kept my interest more. It feels like it lasts forever, and it's just about 45min."
5,legs and obliques are burning,"I just got this DVD on Saturday and used it last night for the first time. I woke up this morning and my thighs and my obliques are really sore. I love that feeling! I will also say that I workout about 3-4 times a week and I have been using Ellen's Fat Burning Pilates for about 4 months (also a good buy) and I so I wanted to see what else she had available. Well this DVD kicked my butt. I had to stop halfway through because I had so much sweat running down my face, it was getting my eyes. Loved it though. I love that burning feeling and the sore feeling the next day. Makes you feel like you did something!"
5,A Well Rounded Instrument,"These maracas are truly well designed musical instruments, not just noise makers. I would recommend this pair to the Latin percussionist as well as the orchestral percussionist. The articulation and smooth sound produced for orchestral style playing is absolutely beautiful and continuous, and can be controlled very easily for soft rolls, crescendos, and even decrescendos. They are also just small enough that they can be held with one hand, freeing the other one up for other auxilliary percussive duties."
1,BBC Fanily Live,I recorded this albumb live from the BBC when it was broadcast. The quality of the recording was fantastic with very good stereo image. This album is the same broadcast but the quality is very poor compared to the original. There is no stereo image.The clapping has been overdubbed in stereo to give it the appearence of a live stereo broadcast but its not. Its a mono recording and the quality is very poor. Sounds like it was a bootleg done on a cassette player. Very poor.!I hope somebody somewhere has a original copy of the broadcast in stereo . It really was fantastic.
1,"Mislead,decieved......",This is a plea to Amazon and sellers thereof.Some or most of your products are seriously underdescribe and lack specifications therefore customers are mislead and decieved into purchaseing. Bought this set of spark plugs for my 2001 honda crv. They certainly do not fit. the ad.mention that it fits honda etc. Apparently they only fits hondas of the 80s
2,Surprised by small capacity.,"I had been looking for a nine inch square baking dish, and thought this one would work. When it arrived, I noted that the sides of the dish were so sloped that the capacity was greatly diminished, and when I test-measured using water, sure enough, it only held 1.5 qts. Was very disappointed. Quality was OK, so I kept it (shipping charges made it too expensive to return).So am still looking for a true nine inch square dish!"
3,Gift to my father-in-law.,"I was expecting the watch's movement to be precise, but no big deal. My father-in-law digs Pierre Cardin and is happy to have received it as a gift. He loves the black face and stainless steel band."
4,Good resource,"This book is a great resource for those of us interested in the history of knitting, the feel of knitting, the type of fibers used, and much more information. But, don't think it'll teach you how to knit. I think there are much better books out there to ""teach"" knitting. This is a book letting you realize that you aren't alone in your love for knitting. It's a delightful quick read."
3,This book is for a very different kind of knitter than me,"If you can sit down and READ the directions and figure out how to do a pattern instead of seeing picture, this book will be helpful for you. I'm a much more visual person and I appreciate more pictures showing how to do something."
2,"No fun at all, not that it is suppose to be","These just aren't designed very well at all. The size, weight, and length are just off for me and I doubt I am alone. It was a chore to use especially because of the temperature - cold. There are better tools on the market."
2,Meh.,"I bought this to help strengthen pelvic floor muscles after baby #1... something that seemed to just not be happening on it's own. But I used it like 3 times, found it to be uncomfortable and a bit heavy for my purposes, and haven't used it since. :("
5,Tosh.O: Hoodies,"This is season one from the hugely popular Tosh.O series. For $12 it is a great buy! You get all the episodes from the first season as well as extended segments, digital exclusives and outtakes. Which total around 220 mins. If you are a fan of his show, then this should be an easy buy. $12 for bluray? That's a no brainier! Ha."
2,Look good but a pain to insall,"I am unimpressed with this item. Once installed, they look nice and perform their function, but installation was a pain. It was not possible for me to get the latches and posts to line up using the factory holes, so I had to drill additional holes in each fender to make everything line up. The included hardware for attaching the posts uses a large, cumbersome square piece in place of a simple nut and washer for underneath the flare. Because the piece is so large, I couldn't get it to lay flush against the fender so the posts stood at an angle making it impossible to fit them in the latch. I had to replace included hardware with nuts and washers I picked up at the local Home Depot. Finally, once everything was installed, to get the hood to close you now have to set it down on the posts and manually move each post to fit into the latches. Overall, I like the way it looks but the installation and function makes it not worth the pain."
4,A Great Series Continues...,"If you're looking to buy this book, I'm assuming that you have already read the great first run of Trigun (Vol. 1 & 2) and the first book of the re-launch title, Trigun Maximum. If not, stop reading this and buy those first.The story of tragic gunman Vash the Stampede continues to unfold as he is visited by more of the Gung Ho Guns. We watch Vash and Wolfwood at odds as they voice their different philosophies, and we witness the return of Legato as we've never seen him before. This volume gives fans more of what they want out of Trigun: great humor, heavy melodrama, chaotic action, and a spaghetti-western style that can't be beat.NOTE: This is a five star book, but because it actually ""ends"" in the middle of a fight I'm knocking a star off. But, make no mistake, I'll be coming back for more."
3,Timeless & Epic,"A private feud gets in the way of a brave soldier's loyalty to his king. An epic battle between good and evil threatens the very order of things. Heroes are made and lost in a clash that sees tens of thousands of warriors slaughtered, their blood flowing like a river. The Song of Roland is perhaps the most famous French epic poem and a priceless piece of literature. This fantastic translation preserves the poetry and rhythm of the original piece, so the language doesn't get in the way. While you're reading, the intensely visual descriptions (you'll get queasy reading about the big battle) and detailed characters will pull you into the world of Charlemagne, and you can't ask for much more than that. Set aside some time for this one, you'll find it hard to tear yourself away."
5,Excellent resource,"I'm teaching a literature class to guys 13-15 years old. The Sayers translation is excellent. Quite accessible. The introductory material was helpful and informative. I have a Christian worldview, and felt that the introductory materials did a good job of capturing the essence of where this poem came from."
1,This book is a work of plagiarism,"Nitzan and Bichler, authors of the groundbraking book, ""The Global Political Economy of Israel"", wrote a detailed article showing how ""Retort"" massively and repeatedly plagiarized their original work and presented it as their own. (go google Nitzan, Bichler, ""The Scientist and the Church"").Nitzan and Bichler predicted that the Iraq War would lead to inflation and rising oil prices when everyone was predicitng the opposite. Now Retort endorses this view after the fact while pretending to be original thinkers.Nitzan and Bichler also show how the authors of Retort had troubles understanding the material they were plagiarizing.To sum up, read the source."
1,Broken after only 2 years,The handle broke off after only 2 years of use. I am unable to repair it with superglue. I would not buy a Pinzon product again.
1,Awful!,"It says this is dishwasher safe - it's NOT! The clear bowl deformed horribly the first time through the dishwasher even on the top rack. Lid never did fit properly, now it doesn't at all, one use and into the trash! Save your money!"
3,Pinzon salad spinner,"This is the second salad spinner I've owned.I bought this one since the bowl on my first one cracked, dare I mentioned the name ,but it was a $25 item. The Pinzon is a heavier construction, but the top of the spinner is difficult to put in place, otherwise it works well.The price is great for the quality.I did read a previous review before I made my purchase, and they also complained about the top being difficult to attach. Happy Spinning!"
2,Does ok,This would be great if the cover fit better. It is hard to keep the cover on but you can use it still. Amazing what washes off what you think is clean.
1,don't buy,Whoever designed this product never used it. Almost impossible to line up the lid with the spin mechanism. The bowl is not perforated so all the muck you spin out seaps back into the food.
4,great product,Using this product helps my lettuce last over a week or more! The only drawback is it won't fit in the dishwasher so I have to wash by hand.
1,Cracked after 1 washing!,"Don't believe the statement that this spinner is dishwasher safe. I followed directions and washed it on the top rack. It emerged with hundreds of fine cracks all the way around, and now it leaks. When I pick it up, it makes a creaking sound, and soon, it's obviously going to break. The plastic bowl is extremely low quality. It bends with the slightest pressureThis product is not durable enough to withstand normal use. Don't buy it."
2,not what I expected,"Doesn't ""dry"" the lettuce. No holes in the bowl so water sits on lettuce. Hard to put the top on, it fits weird. I really don't use it."
3,it gets the job done,"The product is good. It definitely isn't the best, but it's good. The lid doesn't fit very well, but considering that I didn't pay that much, it is worth it."
3,Almost a 4 star,"I found that the spinner was hard open and close - but I like the fact that you can soak your spinach, lettuce or whatever and then drain from top with lid on then give it a spin (its got a small reservoir a bottom to catch the water)."
3,Already cracked.... doesn't dry well.,"Crack in the plastic pretty quick. Doesn't dry lettuce as well as it should. Then again, it was $8.99 so I suppose you get what you pay for, right?"
2,Avoid,Its not easy to wash lettuce in this and getting the lid off is impossible sometimes. There are better brands out there.
3,Better Than The Rating,"This is a very nice salad spinner that I got for about $10 on sale. This is less than half what I'd pay for a similar item at Target. It's easy to clean and use, but can be a little tricky to get the top on properly. Sometimes it takes one or two tries to get the top to seat tightly. Still, considering the price and other pluses, I'd buy it again.Recommended."
5,Lovin' my clean vegi's!,"This product is great! Its a breeze to clean, it cleans my vegis and keeps them crispy in the fridge until im ready to serve them! Its very easy to use and operate, just put the Vegi's in the basket, rinse with cold water. Place basket in water catching bowl, snap on top. spin spin spin Then squeeze bowl gently and top pops right off! And thats it, clean yummy vegis! :)"
2,nowhere for water to drain,The only problem I have with this salad spinner is that the outer clear container does not have any holes for water to drain so the water backs up. Probably better off spending a little more money to get one that has better drainage.
2,Works but low quality,"I purchased two because the price was great. However, the quality is low due to large manufacturing tolerances. On one unit, the top did not fit the base, making the spinning difficult. Oddly, by swaping the top on one unit with the base on the 2nd unit, both could be made to work adequatly. However, once you have spun your greens, there is no way to remove the snapped on top because there is nothing to grab on to. You have to pull up on the spinning knob, which means the unit will not last long. I would not purchase again because it is so difficult to use. Perhaps the unit you buy will fit better. Good luck."
2,Flimsy product,"It works but its not well made. Its hard to get the top on and off. Its nearly impossible to get the inner basket, the outer bowl and the top to snap together properly. Not much thought was put into designing this device. Poorly designed tools are not worth buying regardless of how low the price is. I'd by a different model if I had to do it again."
3,ok spinner for the money,"My biggest complaint about this spinner is that it does not include the storage top as indicated in the product description..otherwise, it performs fine."
3,"Low Price, Medium Quality","I had a really good sturdy salad spinner for years that finally wore out. I replaced it with this one and was surprized at the flimsy construction. It is not nearly as easy to use as my old one, and I'm sure it won't be around for years like that one was, but as the old saying goes, you get what you pay for."
3,Not for storage,"This is a nice spinner for washing the greens, but not for storing in the fridge. I had to take the handle off for it to fit on the shelf, and had to cover the hole in the top with a wet paper towel to keep the lettuce from wilting."
4,Track Listing for this CD Title,"1 Every Little Thing Spanner Banner 4:392 Reason No More Uton Green 4:053 Come Along Everton Blender 3:444 What's the Use Dennis Brown 3:405 Flower of My Garden Iley Dread 3:466 Can You Hear the Calling Mykal Rose 3:377 Roman Soldier Tony Rebel 3:378 Sometime I Wonder Yami Bolo 4:019 Wonders of Creation Dennis Brown 3:34 10 Please Come on Over Spanner Banner 3:4211 Holy Mount Zion Mykal Rose 3:3312 Pray for the Day Rose, Anthony Red 3:4713 Long Live the King Chrisinti 3:4914 Give Jah My All Uton Green 3:47"
5,Schumann's chamber music at it's most inspired,"Dora Schwarzberg is one of the most inspired, challenging and personal violin players of her time. her playing is unequaled. she teaches at the Vienna Music High School and has trained more than 30 violinists, many of whom are now first prize winners in international competitions and/or 'konzertmeister' of international orchestras. she is frequently invited to Verbier and Lugano and often plays with other virtuosos, including Martha Argerich.Polina Leschenko, a 23 year old pianist, has played amongst others at la Roque d'Antheron (France), in the Lugano Festival, and at the Beppu Meeting Point. she has recently signed a contract with Van Walsum Management and her first recording (in 2004 for EMI) received a 'Choc du Monde de la Musique' award in France. she is one of the most promising talents among today's young pianists."
2,I'm one of the few........,"Unfortunately, this product didn't help my milk supply. I also believe it made my baby more gassy. I did continue to use the product until it was gone. I am disappointed, but it doesn't work for everyone."
1,No results,"Everyone's body is different. It didn't work for me. In addition, there is no series of reputable research data to show any use of this product for growth harmone production (which I purchased it for). I believe all people that rate this product as successful is the placebo affect (which a high count of people get using most products). They want it to work so they think it does, etc."
2,Did not help,"I took the fenugreek pills according to the directions and did not notice any noticeable increase in my milk supply. I had much more luck with Motherlove More Milk Special Blend which was recommended by a woman in my Mommy & Me class (she said make sure it's the ""special blend"" pills which you can also find on Amazon)."
5,The Best,"I've used this book in my home, with Sunday School and church activities and teaching preschool. IT IS THE BEST. For parents and teachers who want to guide children in experiencing the mystery of Christmas, this is a great resource. It has stories, activities, and crafts."
2,girl next door sucks big time,didn t like this movie. not my type at all. seems others like it but i dont. good luck with that.
1,Such a joke,Don't watch it for any arousal. It is supposedly about the industry but the cover suggest otherwise. Neither are correct.
3,"interesting,and somewhat revealing (3.5/5)","i found this look inside the life of one woman in the adult film business interesting.for whatever reason,she allowed a camera crew to to follow her around,not just while working but also during her personal life.she seemed very candid and opened her self up.and allowed herself to be very vulnerable.or at least it appears that way.but it's clear she's also a tragic figure.regardless,the film is an entertaining piece and somewhat revealing.you see someone as a human being,and not just as a sex object.as interesting as the film is,there are no real revelations.and,when you get right down to it,it's still a sad subject.for me,The Girl Next Door is a 3.5/5"
1,Not an actual documentary,"Not a documentary as It states, but more of a pity party;. This could have been a legitimate documentary If done correctly. Instead they took the route of a distraught person that no one cares about. Do not waste your time."
4,Conspiracy in Death,"All of her books are good. I didn't know who the killer was, J.D. Robb is very good at keeping you wondering the whole time. I will definitely continue with the series :)"
5,J. D. Robb deserves a better reviewer than Amazon provides,"J. D. Robb's thrillers are tight, gripping, and futuristic stories, all of which should merit her an official Amazon reviewer who has more wit than to spill the plotline. As a reader, who has been eagerly anticipating the next segment in the continuing saga of Eve Dallas, I found it extremely tiresome, irritating, irksome, and annoying (add all the other unmentioned synonyms) that Amazon's reviewer, Nancy O'Brien, blabbed about what's, no doubt, a key line in Robb's plot. In so doing, the reviewer took a lot of the mystery out of Robb's mystery. There is a difference between an incomplete plot summary and a review -- Miss O'Brien's synopsis reads like a review, and her review mostly reads like a synopsis. Before she 'reviews' her next mystery, perhaps Miss O'Brien ought to learn to distinguish between the two."
2,a good read but..,I limed the idea of the book but the author got lost in way too many details about the main character and her billionair husband. in my opinion their relationship was not the story.
3,almost,"I have been reading all of JD Robbs series.... and have enjoyed the future setting and the main characters. This book however had a more complicated list of characters than the others, but failed to deliver any surprises in the end. It was good, but not as good as the others."
4,jd robb rocks,As ever with the Death series JD Robb rocks. All the favorites character are here and continues to draw you into their lives. You feel invested and entwined in their lives as Eve & Company continue solving crimes and making you care.
4,I can't wait for the next book - Where is it???,I stumbled upon the 'Death' series by accident and have been avidly collecting them since. Like many of Nora's readers I eagerly await each new book and keep reading till I finish it.I found this book 'Conspiracy in Death' a wonderful read and I was impressed that Nora gave us Eve's biggest fear - the loss of herself/badge.What I would like to see in a future book is Eve 'giving' to Roarke. He is always there for her - I would really love to see something drastic happen to Roarke which resulted in Eve being there for him - maybe not so much as a Detective but as his wife.
2,"CONSPIRACY IN DEATH, J.D. ROBB",THE DESCRIPTION OF THIS ITEM WAS NOT AS I RECEIVED IT. THE PAGES WERE COMPLETELY YELLOWED. BETTER DESCRIPTIONS SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE PURCHASER OF THESE PRODUCTS.
4,Suspenseful & Exciting,In this 8th book in the In Death series J.D. Robb doesn't disappoint her fans! I fell right into this book as it takes place only a few weeks after the previous book. & It keeps me involved in the story line. I recommend you to give this series a try.
5,Great Read,"Another great story from the usual characters. These books are so easy to read, interesting, fast paced and with enough wit to keep it light."
5,One of My Favorites in the Series!,"Another winning book in the ""...IN DEATH"" series, this one finds Eve fighting for justice for the lower class citizens of New York.After finding a street sleeper dead in his crib, his heart surgically removed, it doesn't take Eve long to figure out that there's some type of conspiracy involved within the medical community. When the threats become personal and Eve is forced to hand over her weapon and her badge, her personal life takes a turn for the worse.This is a very emotional Eve & Roarke read, and highly recommended!"
5,Conspiracy in Death,"A great series from J.D. Robb. Her characters are fun,entertaining, and real. I love the twists and turns. My favorite part is trying to figure out the ending before I reach the end of the book. I would highly recommend this series. I have read all but two - can't wait for more!!!!"
3,Too long,"I rented this book on CD and thought, how could I go wrong with Nora Roberts. I found this book to be slow and I really did not care about the characters. The language bothered me and Eve Dallas just did not come across well in this book. I did not find this book interesting and for an 8 hour drive I fought to finish it. Nora is too good for this kind of writing. Read her Irish trilogy a much better choice."
3,A good vacation read.,"I'll preface this by saying that the futuristic murder mystery is not my usual genre. I found myself desperate for a book with nothing else around -- so I dove into Conspiracy in Death. The ""future"" setting was gritty, dark, cold and impersonal. The interactions between characters were abrupt and simplistic. Things did not always tie together logically. And, at times, I was almost embarrassed to be reading the book. However, I did read the book. In fact, I galloped through it. It gave me the same sense of complete ""escape"" that I get from an occasional soap opera or people magazine. I look forward to having a few more of the ""in Death"" series on hand for the Summer. This book was not a great work of literature ... but it did provide much needed and appreciated entertainment."
1,Lacking Subtitles in English,I was very disapointed to find out that this film has no English subtitles. I require subtitles to view any film... so I have not seen this movie yet ! Bruce N. Miller
2,Mistress of Spices,"I loved the book and am so disappointed by the flimsy one dimensional film. The magic of the book is the character of the Mistress - an older woman. Her growing love affair is beautiful because the younger man learns to see through the external, to the great inner beauty of the Mistress of Spices. As the DVD stand it is simply another trite affair without depths. Pretty, and inconsequential."
4,"Good, but boring","Movie itself is boring. But if you like Aishwarya Rai, you would enjoy it anyway, just admiring her beauty and that special very feminine energy she brings into the World. She is gorgeous and a good actress. If i had a chance just to rent it for a day, i would, but they didnt have it in Blockbuster, so i bought it, and i can call it a waste of money. ""Umrao Jaan"" - thats a great movie with Aishwarya, worth every penny."
4,The Mistress of Spices,"It is a movie that has a mystic side as well as a romantic one. Aishwarya plays an interesting role in this movie but somewhat limited for her abilities. She is a witch. I find her beautiful and intelligent. It is the type of movie that can be seen anytime, anywhere."
4,The Mistress of Spices -- Enchanting!,"This is a beautiful glimpse into an imaginative world of Indian culture and a sort of eastern fairytale, including visions, magic and spells broken. It also speaks to the hearts of those who know what it is to move into and adjust to a new world without losing the core of who they are. The imagery of the spices and the mix of east and west make for a colorful canvas. And Aishwarya Rai is enchanting, as always."
5,Great Movie Can't Wait To Read The Book,"This is now one of my favorite movies. Although it is a romantic comedy there is a lot more to this film than that. The clash of cultures & generations & displaced peoples is all over this film & it makes it all the more interesting. Any fans of Bell, Book & Candle will probably love this movie although the male lead is no James Stewart but close enough.Have to get the book now.........."
3,ok love story..questionable ending,rai is beautiful even in non-colorful saris..the love story is semi belivable..but is unique for the american-indian match..the ending could be planned out better..but the movie as a whole was not bad
3,Intreging,"I found the subject of the film and the actress intreging and actually well done, but the male star a major disappointment. I realize they used him for his name, high profile, but his acting left a lot to be desired. The ""damamged"" image would have worked well for a stronger actor, but he lacked the nuances which have made the film an incredible piece of work!"
3,The Mistress of Spices,"Aishwarya Rai is a very beautiful woman, one of those museum pieces- to be seen and admired but not touched, someone that one desires but cannot attain, and that is how this fairytale of a movie unfolds. It is serious yet entertaining. The mysticism associated with spices is a new twist that is not completely out of the realm of imagination but is certainly a streach. How that mysticism is co-related to Tilo, the protagonist's ability to see the future has not been fully explored here. The acting of all the characters is perfect. This is the first time I have seen Aishwarya in a steaming lovemaking scene. That was done to perfection. All in all a good chick flick."
3,Tumeric for the soul,This is a pleasant little crossover movie which holds the attention of the viewer throughout.It is probably easy for some to dismiss the film as lightweight fluff but if the intention is to bring Indian movies more into the mainstream of the American culture it will achieve it's purpose.It is a well crafted story from the makers of Bend It Like Beckham and I hope that the fans it generates will follow a lightly followed path into more of the movies that India produces.It is a very pleasant romantic story that tugs at the heartstrings but I must say I do yearn for something more substantial.
5,buffy move over,this movie shows what one woman will do to see what her desires will drive hjer to do and what she knows she should do. but this movie dose have a lot in common with the simply irresistable movie and the main focus on the food and what it dose except this has to do with the world of spices.
1,bloody awful,"Pathetic plot, shallow acting, no character development, and an Orientalist perspective of the East. Just an utter waste of time."
2,Mistress of the Spiceless,"This movie had the potential to be good but failed on so many levels that I want my two hours back. I watched and loved Bride and Prejudice and thought this movie would be along the same lines. It was compared to Bell, Book and Candle, the only similarity was her talking to the spices instead of a cat. Watch the original it is a joy to watch.The acting in this film is dull, the script is mindless and what's with the red chili peppers? The only redeeming thing in this film is the beauty of the spice shop and Aishwarya Rai. Give me the joy of Bollywood that leaves me wanting to dance."
4,unsung gem,"This is a lovely little romantic gem without the need for undue violence, gratuitous sex, or sick psychology. A sort of Bollywood ""The Shop Around the Corner"" with a drop of magical cinema. Enjoy in the spirit it was intended."
4,Movie was brand new but...,The delivery was not good at all. I had to call Amazon to find out about my package. Of course they blamed UPS for lost shipping. But still that is a disappointment for both parties. Amazon did refund my shipping. I did get my movie but it was not at the time promised. I guess if you are ordering something from amazon you have got to pray for the best. Best wishes.
4,who says?,"who said this series was made for kids?okay, the merchandise says it. but us older fans r still relevant and the show recognises that. im a fan of all of star wars and this series rocks!!!"
5,Genial,"Muy buena calidad, de acuerdo a lo que esperaba, el arribo fue en el plazo indicado mas aún considerando que estoy en Chile"
3,Clone Wars Season 2,"The product works fine.... But it had some type of dirt on it which I didn't appreciate, but other than that it, all of the dvd's work fine."
4,The best currently-running adventure cartoon is better on Blu-Ray!,"This review is of the Blu-Ray release of STAR WARS: THE CLONE WARS (SEASON 2).Star Wars fans are an opinionated lot, and I won't presume to know whether they'll like or dislike this. But fans of plain old cartoons will have absolutely nothing to complain about here. If you love adventure cartoons then this will make you feel like a kid again. If you are still a kid, then I envy you -- beg Mom for this!"
1,"Why, George why? Or should I say ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!""","I guess it's George Lucas's right to destroy what he created, but I just don't understand why.In over twelve hours over 6 episodes of LIVE ACTION films there was never a need for curse words (clone wars clone troopers) or gratuitous murder (clone wars bounty hunters).What is worse, is that the violence and language occur not in the pursuance of something uniquely Star Wars, but in the conveyance of film cliches (we get it, clone troops are army men and bounty hunters are cowboys, great).My kid will watch it because it has the letters S T A R W A R S on the package. But that's where the magic ends.Why George, why? Can I not even appeal to your enlightened self interest."
5,quite possibly the best cartoon on tv,"im not sure what im more excited about a new avatar or a new star wars clone wars. either way, you cant go wrong buying this, great great series!!!"
3,Good graphics but storyline not for kids under 9 or 10,"I loved season one! We got that for our 5 year old to watch and it was appropriate for him...no real scary parts and the animation was great! He also ""got"" the story lines.We got season two and it is much more dark, scary and violent. The 2-4th or 5th episodes are all about jedi kids being kidnapped and potentially killed...Of course the jedi prevail but it's way too scary for a kid younger than 9 or 10....maybe even 13!We'll watch it eventually with him but just not now...so parents take notice."
5,The 2nd Season on Blu-Ray shines better than the 1st.,"The series is improving and so is the animation and quality of the show. Blu Ray is the best way to watch The Clone Wars and well the best way to watch anything for that matter, but getting into the quality its just perfection, the sound is great on the surround sound and I just love how crisp and clean it feels, the episodes themselves are huge improvements over the first season, it seems like the series is progressively getting better I would like to see atleast four seasons released."
4,A good season 2,"With less direction and story development than the first season, this is still an excellent cartoon.Again, some may find this a little violent for younger audiences. There are fewer moral lessons taught during this second season as well. I still watched the entire season with few breaks.Packaging is exactly a continuation of the first season but could be susceptible to younger children gaining access and destroying the contents, not that I know that or anything!Enjoy!"
5,Finally season two in dvd !,"Since my son and husband are big clone wars fan, I was starting to be annoyed to watch season one over and over. Finally season 2 is upon us and we can watch new episodes together. Story is even more thrilling !"
4,love it,We are huge fans of the Clone Wars (Mom as much as kids) so we love it and have been watching the episodes non stop since Christmas.
5,what it is and what it's supposed to be,"Good stuff, as it's supposed to be. It's exactly what it is, no less, no more, shouldn't be any worse, but can't really be any better either."
5,Great!,"My daughter is 10, and loves this book. Her Grandmother gave it to her when she was about 5. She reads it with her Grandmother whenever possible. I notice it has helped with her reading a great deal. She will ""act"" out the characters while they read and gets very into the stories. Her favorite is Pandora's Box. The stories are a great educational tool, she is learning lessons and doesn't even realize it. She will ask questions and want to know more about different subjects brought up in the stories.I recommend this book highly!"
5,High quality paperback,"This book is very well produced. It is oversized with thick, glossy pages and tons of action on every page.Marcia Williams is a great storyteller, and her style presents simple panels of information that move the action along. Her scenes, even the scary ones, seem happy and non-threatening. This book is perfect for reading aloud to younger children, who may be too frightened of bloodshed and monsters to tolerate some of the more realistically-illustrated books.In this book, you get:Pandora's BoxArion and the DolphinsOrpheus and EurydiceThe Twelve Tasks of Heracles (Hercules)Daedalus and IcarusPerseus and the Gorgon's Head (Medusa)Theseus and the MinotaurArachne and AthenaEach story gets four big pages. Some of the full-page illustrations are just perfectly memorable and fun for a child to try to imitate the style (especially Icarus flying too close to the sun).Well done book. Very enjoyable."
5,wow!,I am impressed. Greek mythology has been presented in a way that young kids will enjoy. Because the art work is comic book like and the dialogue is hilarious the violent parts of greek mythology don't seem so scary for young readers. I'm glad I purchased it.
4,GREEK MYTHS FOR YOUNG CHILDREN,"I LIKED THIS BOOK - I ORDERED IT FOR MY SEVEN YEAR OLD AND READ IT TO HIM. THE CARTOON FORMAT IS FUN AND THE TEXT IS TRUE TO THE ORIGINAL MYTHS. SOME OF THE HUMOUR WAS OVER HIS HEAD, BUT IF YOU STICK TO THE TEXT AND LEAVE OUT THE DIALOGUE ""BUBBLES"" THE STORIES ARE WELL TOLD."
5,it's a winner,"Ok, so I'm reviewing this as a 3 year old boy who LOVES this movie. Of course I watch it and all the while I'm thinking, this is NOT the same as The Land Before Time. It's not the same voices, it's not as well done, but then I glance over at my son in awe of the dinosaurs singing, dancing, fighting, and playing and completely forget the first move. This movie is awesome. It's got everything any little boy would love. Huge dinosaurs, `sharp tooth' x's 3, and the great circle. If your kids love dinosaurs you can't go wrong with this movie."
3,Not our favorite TLBT movie.,"We gave this to our 4 year old for Christmas.My son loves the Land Before Time movies but got up several times during this movie. It didn't seem to keep his interest throughout??I, personally, didn't love the storyline in regards to Littlefoot finding his long lost father, then making the decision to not go with him. At the same time, I wouldn't want him to leave behind his grandpa but it just didn't feel good either way.So, 3 stars because I feel there are better TLBT choices!"
3,Perhaps the weak link in the series,"This movie, which was my least favorite, is centered around Littlefoot and all longnecks who go on a quest to answer questions about a mysterious dream they have. All longnecks feel the dream tells them they must arrive somewhere to save the world from something (which I won't spoil). In the end, Littlefoot and the longnecks complete the task they set out to perform. Littlefoot gets a suprise when he meets his long lost father. Littlefoot must make the difficult choice of joining his father and leaving his friends (who follow Littlefoot on his quest) or stay with his friends and grandparents at the Great Valley."
5,Land Before Time,"Item received promptly and in good order. The Land before Time is a great series for kids interested in dinosaurs, and this movie was great."
3,Can't make up my mind.,"For once, I'm not writing a bad review about LBT. My mom bought this for me as a present for a report card. When I watched it, This one really touched my heart. I just found out that I had a father as well and this whole thing actually had happened to me. This is the only good review that you are going to see out of me."
4,little foots dad,in this moive little foot meets his dad and in the end his dad promises to visit him in the grate vally the onley bad ting about this movie wheen i bout this movie i thout i might see ally or the lone dinosour oh well i stell love this movie
3,This movie is not too bad,"I am pretty neutral about this movie. Strangely enough, it is the only movie that is appropriate for very young children yet provokes violence and hateful reviews from some teenagers. So what do you rate a movie that is not OK for adults? You must be under 13 to watch this movie. CG -13? ..."
3,Alright,"It's good, you get to find out about Little Foot's father, but it's very boring at the end. I am getting bored here!"
2,Bad teaching in otherwise good movie,"My kids love the Land Before Time series and so I was excited for the new movie. What a dissappointment!My problem - the child dinosaur makes his own decision regarding who he lives with and the adult dinos are wishy-washy in their guidance and have no authority. Kids need love and encouragment, but also need adults to provide structure and directions and set appropriate boundaries.Last time I checked my kids are my responsibility as their parent. I need to act like a parent and make tough decisions for them. Input from children is good, but they are children and should not make life-changing decisions on their own.I do not like that this movie teaches that children should make their own major decisions. That is not fair to them - they are not ready or able."
5,Light and compact!,"One of the best $10 investments I've made. Use it constantly, keep it in my laptop bag. Use it in the office, at conferences, in the car with an AC/DC converter. Don't know how I made do without it before."
4,Monster MP OTG400 BK Outlets To Go 4 Outlet Travel Power Strip (Black),"Ordered this item for an overseas trip. Arrived quickly but appears to be in used condition. Nothing on the Amazon.com page says that it's used, but it works fine."
4,"Small, Light, Works","I like to keep this little power strip in my notebook bag and it definitely comes in handy. It's small, lightweight and compact and provides some protected outlets. The only thing i don't like is how short the cord is, but even then, it's not that big a deal."
5,Nevermind,Nevermind! Today I found the reset button on the power strip and it is working fine! Duh!Monster MP OTG400 WH Outlets To Go Power Strip (White)
2,Not compatible with Kensington International Travel Plug,"I purchased a Kensington International Travel Plug and got a recommendation that the Monster MP OTG400 BK Outlets to go Power Strip was a good purchase to go with the Travel Plug. Based on the fact that the two were recommended together, I purchased the Monster MP Outlets to Go, only to discover when I had received the items that there is NO WAY to plug the Power Strip into the Kensington Travel Plug. This made my purchase of the Power Strip pointless as the whole idea was to be able to plug in multiple items at the same time when traveling internationally. I was very disappointed."
2,Not a surge protector,"I bought it expecting a mini-surge protector, but the safety tag says ""This power strip is not a surge protector."" Something else you should know; when plugged in, the plug glows obnoxiously bright blue. It's bright enough to keep me awake. I would not buy it again. I recommend the Belkin one instead, which has surge protection and a much less annoying tiny green light to show that it has power."
2,Main cord sticks to the side when plugged in,"The way most outlets are installed on the wall, the cord sticks to the side, rather unsightly, rather than going straight down (or up). There is no way to lay the cord neatly; I purchased this to plug my phones on my kitchen counter and the lateral sticking cord looks unsightly; I consider this a design flaw. Probably the best option would have been to have the plug rotate freely so the cord can be arranged neatly regardless of the position of the plug/outlet/cord (albeit for a higher price)."
1,"BEWARE!!!! ---> ""Electrical Rating 125VAC 60HZ""",Everything is perfect except Electrical Rating is 125VAC 60HZ only !!!! It is clearly stated on the product!!!You are in danger to start a fire if you plug this into 240v!!!
1,Where's the ratings?,"The power strip is a nice item for travelers but its useless if it can't protect your equipment. The most important thing to keep in mind when buying surge protectors is the clamp down voltage and joule ratings. Clamp down voltage should be around 300-400 volts, the lower the better. Joule rating should at least 800 joules or higher, the higher the better. Amazon does not disclose this information on this product & neither does Monster on their website. Be sure to do your homework before buying any type of surge protection."
1,"don't buy it, after 5 months it does not work",I am very unhappy with product. It does not work after 5 months of use and maybe 4 trips.
3,Does it fit your adaptor or converter for foreign electrical outlets ?,"I took this device to China but when I went to plug it into my adaptor it would not fit because my adaptor was only good for 2 prong American plugs and this devise had 3 prongs (including ground). A bad surprise. Since I had successfully used my adaptor in Egypt and Israel it never occurred to me to try to connect it to the power strip before I left for China.I rate it 3 stars because it won't work with many adaptors that people may have already purchased.Of course the power strips three prongs mnake it a safer device, but if it won't fit your adaptor it is useless in a foreign country."
1,Don't Buy It!,"I have used Monster brand products before and always had good results, but the first time I plugged 2 items into this strip it blew out. I would not recommend this to anyone!"
5,Perfect for Laptops,"I was originally using a cheap single outlet surge protector I got from a local electronics store. When I decided I needed something with more outlets (for the laptop and a portable hard drive) I did a Google search and found this. I loved the way it was designed to be compact and portable. The short power cable simply wraps around the outlets and plugs into one of them. Perfect to carry around in my laptop backpack. A better solution than carrying around a small power strip (which is what a friend does). It only cost about $15 when I bought it from Amazon, which is a fair price for something like this from Monster."
3,"received 5.9oz, not 2.4oz, version","I ordered the black Monster power strip because it had an advertised weight of only 2.4 ounces (.15 pounds) and appeared smaller than the white version available. But I received a black 5.9oz power strip that is about 1.5 times longer than the one pictured -- it looks like the white one pictured, except in black. It works fine and all, it's just bigger and weighs three times as much as was advertised."
2,Nice but Died Quickly,"We purchased this mini multiple outlet plug set for traveling. It was convenient and functional - but stopped working 2 weeks into our trip.The light comes on, but no one's home! Nothing that we plug in receives any power.*** LARichard ***"
5,Brilliant,"Normally I wouldn't touch Monster's overpriced and overhyped products with a 10 foot pole, but this is an exception. Brilliantly designed, compact, effective, reasonably priced. What's not to like?"
4,Right size,"I was so glad to run across this product. I always have such trouble when I travel connecting all of my devices in hotel rooms. I can easy fit all 6 of my devices with their big AC plugs into it. Wish it came in black like the ""Outlets to go power Strip 4"" does...oh well."
3,4-prong travel plug,"Although this compact electrical multi-outlet is handy for traveling in a motor home, it doesn't have surge protection built in, so I was disappointed in that. However, it still is a nice compact item and I will still use it."
3,"Great idea, flimsy execution","Compact and convenient for travel. Unfortunately, the gray plates covering the outlets started to fall off on the third day."
5,Worked great!,"Just back from two weeks in Italy and this was a lifesaver!For electronics that work on both voltages..and that is most, just check the charger...all you need is one country plug and you are set to go. iPod..net book..camera batteries..travel fan all plugged in and using just one hotel room outlet.And live how it folds up so neat and small.I saw people that had a question about using with 220 volts. No, it is NOT a converter, but for many, many electronics a converted is not needed and this will work to expand your outlets like a charm. Just get one little correct country plug."
4,Handy...but,"Device is just what it looks like and works fine.Pros: small, compact, light, 6 plugs right where you need them. It lives in my laptop bag.Cons: short cord, you may need an extension (this is also a Pro, of course). No On/Off switch. You need to unplug it from the wall if you use it on something that's subject to over charging or that you don't want to leave hot all the time."
1,SIDE OFFTAKE!,"Be aware that the configuration of the plug that goes into the wall outlet requires that the cord come off the plug sideways (to the left when looking at a three prong plug with the ground at the bottom). This is probably fine for most people since it will work on duplex wall outlets that have one plug on top of the other. However, for my needs, it didn't work because I have a set of 4 outlets that are side-by-side and I need to use a series of three of these in a row. I used to have an older version with a straight take-off that works but I guess they don't make it anymore."
3,"Nice, But....","This is a nice product, but with a big BUT. It is promoted for travelers, but the description states nothing about voltages handled. You only find out that the unit is suitable for 110V, but not 220V, use when you receive the unit. So it is useless for European travel."
3,Not Good for the International Traveler,"This is a decent portable power strip. It's robust, sturdy and rather elegant. However if I only read the reviews I would have known that this is not suitable for an International Road Warriors as the electrical rating is only: 10A 125 VAC 60 HZ [I have since added the specs to the product description]. As such this product is only good for the US market and can not be used overseas. I decided to keep it as shipping it back would cost more than the product. As always read the reviews before buying."
5,Handy Device,The power cord is everything I hoped for: Small and compact and yet providing a way to power several items in a hotel or airport I recommend it.
4,Convenient for people carrying many gadgets,"I brought it on my every trip. It saves space and very convenience for persons with many gadgets like me. I normally bring cell phone, laptop, compact camera and now an iPad. so i can charge all of them from one outlet at hotel."
5,Probably the best frequent traveller gadget to must have.,"An absolute must-have for the frequent traveller. Ever noticed that you have to search for outlets in a hotel room? Just plug it in that single hotel room desk lamp outlet and charge your laptop and cell phone while you work or sleep. Also, when sitting in an airport waiting for a delayed air plane did you ever noticed that the only available outlets are always taken by the smart ones sitting on the floor next to you? Just ask to share their outlet with your power strip and you have juice and a good conversation going too. The one downside is that I found recently the exact same model, but with two USB ports. I would have bought that instead, so I can leave the phone adapter at home. I have used mine a lot, it holds up well, and is light enough too. On top of that, it attracts some attention for the proverbial 'cool factor'."
5,Perfect for traveling,"I purchased this item before a cruise, after reading that most ships' cabins have only one or two outlets (which proved to be true). It was a lifesaver for charging multiple electronic devices, using hair dryers and flat irons, etc. Since then I've used it for all of my business travel. It is compact, light, and works like a charm. It arrived quickly, and the price is great. I'm very happy with this purchase."
5,Perfect for every trip.,I love this power strip. It doesn't take up any room in my bag and I take it everywhere I go. The perfect travel partner.
4,Great travel item for business,"Perfect small gadget to add to the already overwhelmed charger pouch that travels with me. While you never want to add anything more to a pack brimming with electronics, this one is well worth it. Looking at the desk in my hotel room, I had one outlet that was easy to reach, and a laptop, cell phone, and a tablet to charge all at once. Nothing else has come close to this handy little package that quadrupled the availalbe outlets. And on the way home, used it to share one of those scarce airport outlets with two fellow travelers...."
4,How did I manage to travel without this?,"After spending far too much time unplugging hotel fridges and lamps to find enough plugs, I decided I should get a portable power strip. Small and light and enough plugs for me needs. I just get to South America and find only 1 of my travel plugs will fit into the wall sockets, no problem. I'd give it 5 but I'm still not sure about the 45 degree tilt of the plug for all uses. Maybe after some time I will upgrade. Will never travel without it again."
4,Great at being what it is,"Keep in mind what this device is not:* surge protector* extension cord* featherweight* inexpensiveIt is however compact, and extremely convient to use. It's easy to toss into a bag (not minding the weight--it's heavier than it looks) and take with me to the airport, coffee shop, or conference, places where power outlets are at a premium. I've received many compliments for being the only one ""prepared.""Five stars if I didn't feel as if this was much more expensive than it should be (as is typical with other Monster products)."
3,not good for blowdryers,"This i believe is a 10 amp. Normal ones are 15amps. This is a nice looking and small powerstrip for computers and small stuff.. plugged my blowdryer in and it popped the surge protecter.. also when you want to reset it, you have to look for a pin as you cannot push it with your finger."
5,This is super useful,"This basically stays in my travel kit. I have plenty of power strips at home, so I don't get a lot of use out of this, but I've found it extremely useful every time I've traveled. Give me one outlet, and all my devices are charged overnight. Great product."
1,NOT FOR OVERSEAS USE. GOOD FOR USA ONLY,"This is only good to use by itself within USA. The product is clearly marked "" Electrical Rating 125VAC 60HZ"". For you to be able to safely use this overseas, it has to be plugged to power converter/transformer that has an output of 110-120V. It is risky to plug this directly into 220-240V as it is not rated to handle such voltage. Monster Co. did not even bother to mention this. I will be cautious in buying Monster products in the future as they can be monsterously dangerous."
1,Not international!,"I bought this since it looked as though it was designed for international use. Sadly, it is NOT rated for 220v. It would be dangerous to use this in most countries in the world as a result. Uggg! NOT what I wanted or needed!"
1,"Nice form, but the light is very bright and it does not work as a surge protector","This is a very pretty powerstrip, but the bright blue light can keep you up at night. If you plan to use this hotel rooms, this could be a huge drawback. As it offers no surge protection, the only reason you'd be buying this is to get an additional outlet.I really can't justify taking this device on any of my trips."
3,confused,"hi, i have a question.can i use this device in the uk and pakistan's outlet plug..i cant tell how many prongs does this has. doesnt say nor does it showhelp!"
5,Good travel outlet,"Allowed me to charge camera and other batteries and use a computer when I had only one outlet in my cabin. Great for travel, light and compact."
5,Great travel gadget,Just came back from a month in Spain and Italy and this little gem did a stellar job of letting me connect a number of devices at one time. Folds up tite and travels well. Get one for yourself.
5,4 outlet travel power strip,Just the thing for travel! Great product for minimizing space in your luggage. A must have for travelers on the go.
5,NOT A SURGE PROTECTOR! BUT SUPER GREAT/HANDY/USEFUL,"Love the compact design and the spacing of the plugs (and I really like the blue light on the wall plug, since the first outlet I tried this on was broken and would have thought it was the product, but for the blue light not coming on).Got a 7"" portable TV, add a Media Player and other av products, and THIS IS A MUST to bring along with you.It really folds nicely and open to provide great spaced needed outlets.REMEMBER - NO SURGE PROTECTOR INCLUDED - but just love it."
5,This is a great item for a traveler,"I travel alot and one of the worst parts is that there are never enough outlets for all of my electronics --- computer, phone, blue tooth, kindle --- you get the picture. Usually there is one outlet which holds two products. With this power strip, I can charge everything on one plug. I actually use one in my bedroom as the main outlet is behind the bed. I can plug in my kindle and phone and still have a separate outlet for the lamp. I bought one of these years ago from Sharper Image for ALOT more money. Excellent purchase!"
5,Great Travel Accessory,"I think this is a great travel accessory. When I travel, I always have that dilemma of the one plug on the desk for my PC but then trying to find that accessible wall plug for my cell phone (this is critical since I use my phone as my alarm). This accessory eliminates this issue. It also has a light on it that ensures that the plug has power so it eliminates the Jim Furyk issue (no power to the plug that caused him to miss an event since his phone is his alarm and it died!). It packs very easily and it is a must have now for me."
5,Awesome,We bought this Belkin power strip for our trip to Ireland. We bought it since we only planned on carrying two converters and between our iphones and ipads and computer we knew we would need more than 1 power strip. It worked great and since it is so small and lights up when it is one we actually have continued to use it at home.
3,The Jury is still out,"I'm still evaluating my purchase, we'll see how reliable it is. I preferred this over the belkin because of the spacing of the plugs, you can use several large adapters here. Unfortunately, as everyone has commented, this should have included a rotating plug for the wall, not having one makes this product suffer."
3,Short cord,"Obviously this does what it says it's going to do... its a surger protector with four plugs. Only thing I didn't like is how short the cord is. I always though 12in was pretty good, but when it's not long enough to allow the surge protector to lay flat on the counter or ground. It ends up hanging a little. Other than that I think it does what it needs to do which is why it got the three star 'its ok' rating."
2,wrong product,"When I read about it, it described it as a converter for US power cords to British outlets. It is purely for American outlets."
3,Beautiful book,"This is a delightful memoir written by a woman who cannot hear. In losing her ability to hear, she gained an awareness of the importance of listening. It is that awareness that she shares in this book. _Listening_ is a composite of personal experiences and scientific studies regarding sound. The author speaks of sounds made and perceived in the natural world, bringing a fresh awareness of those sounds to her readers."
4,So cute!,"These toys are adorable and functional. They'll attach to other toys, including playmats, stroller toys etc. Not so sure why they're so expensive though.... still fun and unique!"
3,Cute but unsure about safety,"It's really cute and my baby seems to enjoy it. However, as a teething toy, I do have concerns. It's made in china and not BPA free. I removed the three black and white pieces because some of the material appears to be easily chewed off."
3,Not exactly as pictured,"I purchased this item because I was attracted to the distinct look of the characters. First of all, the package they came in was round. Not a big deal in the least bit because all of the pieces were brand new and accounted for. I have to say that the characters aren't quite as cute as pictured. In the pictures, their eyes bulge out. The set I received have embroidered eyes...not as fun or cute to look at. All in all, the set is colorful and bright...that much I do like about it, so I've decided to keep it. My son hasn't arrived yet, but we'll soon see if he enjoys playing with these links or not."
1,MADE IN CHINA -- not for my grandbaby!,"Due to the ongoing problems with products manufactured in China over the past few years, I was so disappointed to get these beautiful Kushies Zolo Links and discover that they were actually made in China. I do not think it is appropriate to import items from that locale for babies who will be putting these things in their mouths."
3,"Fun, but a lot of money","The concept of these is really great. I keep mine on the side of the fridge, and they are as fun for adults as they are for kids!! However, for the cost I don't believe that there's enough value - it's fun and colorful and does stimulate the imagination, but unlike something like Legos there's only so many ways you can stack them, so it doesn't occupy attention for a long time. I would only recommend this product if you could find it for considerably cheaper than $50 - maybe second-hand. Or it would make a great gift for the parents who have everything."
2,Never really fun,"He wasn't into these at all, the linking things was sort of interesting but just not that great. So he'd play for about 30 secs then run off, waste of money for us."
2,Okay,"I was so excited to get this toy. I love the idea but this has been an expensive toy that has barely been played with. You can create a few different configurations but with the lack of pieces, there are only a couple ways to get it to work and be balanced. If I get it out and ""force"" it on my two and four year old they may play with it for a couple minutes but mostly it is collecting dust on our shelf. Wish I could have this purchase back."
3,meh.,Smaller than I thought it would be but is really cute. My one year old niece didn't really want much to do with it. I ended up using them as baseballs for batting practice with my 2 year old nephew...maybe they'll have better luck with them once they're home and away from the family Christmas madness.
3,"Cute, great concept but price is ridiculous","There is no denying these little guys are cute, and the concept is wonderful and creative. But check the dimensions - everything is smaller than I had anticipated. Our 18-month old does not initiate play with these independently but she does like playing with them with someone else if they start it. Just be prepared that for the price you aren't physically getting much, and as other reviewers have stated, the base is pretty flimsy."
2,"Cute, but also not a kid favorite","I like the design too, but also think that our daughter doesn't really play with it- and she's had it for over a year... probably appeals to adults more than kids. I recommend getting magnetic toys that have multiple purposes for a range of ages... magnatiles?"
5,A must buy.,"This has kept our baby occupied better than almost any other toy. She loves to open and close the box, look at the mirror and the different patterns and listen to the crinkly sounds. She loves it and it's a great developmental toy! This is a must buy."
5,"Socks were great, but were very small.","My son usually wears a size large sock, but these socks might have fit him when he was 8. That is the only problem. The socks are very well made, but just to small. My younger nephew got them instead."
3,"This is a very enjoyable book, more History than Mystery.","Dorothy & Sidney Rosen's ""Death & Blintzes"" is a loving and very entertaining look at a specific place and time: West Boston, 1936, where somewhat-Americanized Jewish immigrants nervously explore a great new world. Sometimes it's the best of everything--great ""nosherai"" and fabulous movie stars--and sometimes it's a little frightening, as when a worker can lose a non-Union job through no fault of her own. Garment worker/detective Belle Appleman is a 36-year-old widow who enjoys her world but treats it with appropriate caution. When a fellow factory worker is killed, who but Belle would have the chutzpah to ""help"" the Boston Police Department find the murderer? This book is soft-boiled in the best sense of the word, although sex and violence are both treated in a matter-of-fact way. The novel's strength is in its honesty to a time and place which may well be forgotten by the time the next generation of American Jews comes of age."
4,"Beautiful, Old-Fashioned Whitework","I bought this book originally because of the three wide crocheted lace patterns. I love the heavy but dainty thick lace you see on antique pillowcases and sheets, but couldn't find any patterns until this book. I shy away from the cheesy multi-colored patterns you see so often in modern books, so this was a natural fit. The patterns in this book are vintage... and I'm so glad!"
2,For those who like old-fashioned crochet,"The synopsis is right on the mark. This book is very old-fashioned - from the patterns right down to the print. I dare to say, even boring. The designs are (as mentioned) from decades ago, so if you're looking for young, fun designs you won't get it here. The pictures are in black and white and the print is old, typewriter style. Out of the claimed 150 designs (I didn't check to see if there are really 150), only about 5 really interested me. Even my 67 year old mother remarked that none of the designs 'jumped out at her'. On the positive side though, the book is easy to follow with charts and abbreviation guides, crochet hook conversions and 17 basic crochet stitches. I will recommend the book for a beginner who wants simple designs, but for a seasoned pro who has done it all, something newer and more challenging is needed - unless of course you lost all your mother's old books and want one with old favorites for your home library :)"
1,C.R.U.D.,"Wow, I must be out of the loop on this one,because I couldn't find honest to goodness scare or laugh in this BOMB! WHAT A WASTE OF MY TIME. I guess that I just don't get it! Pewee, this one stinks."
1,Terrible.,"As a fan of 80s horror I need to put this out there. CHUD is a terrible move, poorly made, lacking in horror, slow paced, bad acting, bad script, and poorly filmed."
3,Too scary,I saw this when I was a kid and it scared the bejesus out of me. It's pretty stupid to think about now but still a creepy movie.
5,Cannibalistic Humanoid Underground Dwellers,"It's hard to dislike a movie so intentionally bad. It's hard to like it, too, but since I've already seen the movie a lot of times, I can't help but let my heart leap with joy of owning it on DVD. Not for everyone, but definitely for me."
3,goverment cover up,"If your like me and believe that our goverment, on matter you is in office does and has on going covert operations then you might like this film, this is an old classic that I like. could something like this be ture?, maybe, think area 51 cover up. Who lmows whats underneath our city streets. this is a fun film, it made me wonder what if!"
4,Good 80's Horror Flick.,I rented this in the 80's and always wanted to see it again. It was ok this time around. But seemed much better way back when the idea of toxic waste turning people into monsters was a newer concept.
4,Cannibalistic Humanoid Underground Dwellers,"Daniel Stearn's performance in this film is without question his best to date, combine that with the brillant writing in the script and you have a true cult classic on your hands with this film!!I love zombie films and that's why I love C.H.U.D.!! The C.H.U.D.s may radioactive mutants but they deliver the same end of world feel as Romero or Fulci's creations. They are in short an army of Argento type demons lurking below the streets of New York just waiting to spread their diease across the world.In one of the best scenes of this film a group of N.R.C. scientists accompanied by three S.W.A.T. team members armed with flamethrowers and assualt rifles stumble upon a lone C.H.U.D. It makes its way through the team's flamethrowers and tears them all to sheds.Even the X-files have paid homeage to this film with an episode entitled ""The Host"". If you haven't seen this one, you truly need to!!!!!"
2,Ok monster movie for the faint hearted.,"Good start for a horror movie, but some cheesy parts. The mood is creepy but the plot is corny. There could have been better effects, but it is better than its sequel. Try it out you might like it, hardcore horror fans probably won't."
3,The Benefits of DVD,"I won't pretend that CHUD is as good a film as Seven Samurai, or The Battle of Algiers, but their is a kind of love affair tht develops between viewers and this film with seemingly very little going for it. The cast is actually quite strong (see other reviews) and the effects are campy, and gimmiky (sp?) but that isn't why you'll like this film. Through several viewings, over several years I tried to figure out what in this strange little movie appealed to me. When the local Mediaplay went out of business I found CHUD in a bin for about 95% off and snatched it up. I got my answer from the commentary. Without a doubt, the commentry for this film is one of the best I've ever heard. Just listen and you'll see why everyone loves CHUD. The humor, the heartache, the-- Okay, it isn't the Dead Sea Scrolls, but it is almost more entertaining that the film. This is the one and only time I've invited a friend to listen the commentary, rather than watch the film. Enjoy."
1,D.U.D.,"Egads! This is an awful movie. Even by 80s standards it's possibly one of the worst, slow moving, jaw yapping so called horror films I have ever seen and I've seen some doozies.The movie is nothing but one long scene of inane boring dialogue after another with perhaps a split second of monster ""scares"" thrown in between. An entire hour and fifteen minutes goes by before any kind of excitement happens and it's pretty mediocre when it does. There isn't a single scare throughout, not a moment of suspense and subplots that go nowhere. Who cares that the photographer's girlfriend is pregnant, it had nothing to do with the story at all.And the extended shower scene that shows up if you click on the C.H.U.D.'s glowing eyes during the menu is identical to the scene in the movie, the only difference is you get to see the T&A; that was cut out of the theatrical release.Stay away, stay far far away from this awful movie or watch it on high speed fast forward like I did.C.H.U.D is a D.U.D."
4,Watch Out! They're Toxic!,"The government decides that the best way to dispose of hazardous waste is to use New York city as a toilet. This works just great, until the underground homeless folks turn into radioactive mutants with a hankerin' for human flesh! John Heard is a photographer who begins to figure out the inane conspiracy with the help of a homeless shelter operator (played seriously by Daniel Stern). Together they take on both the CHUDsters and the equally slimey government operatives. C.H.U.D. has it's creepy moments, as well as being fun to watch. Look for John Goodman's microscopic role as a cop in the diner. May the CHUD be with you..."
2,Played on 42nd Street Forever In It's Day,This filmed hung around 42nd street I think over a year when it was out. It's a classic horror film about monsters in the sewer. If you really like horror films set in NYC then give it an extra star.
4,Great 80's movie,"When I first saw this movie on video i immedaitally loved it. It had suspense, some good action and music. The only problem i had with it was the lousy editing, especially the diner scene with john goodman, it's obvious that this was switched around to the end probably to get the sequel ready. NOTE: Don't get CHUD II unless you are a die hard zombie fan it's worth a rental but that's it. Now that CHUD is finally on DVD, and unedited it's even better. You don't really care about the characters too much because most all of them are irritating anyway. But once tthe CHUD's start snatching people off the streets it's great fun to watch them scatter about in the sewers."
3,A pretty good 80's horror flick,"I originally saw this movie when I was a kid. I remember it scaring the crap out of me and really enjoying it. So one day I'm checking out the horror section at a video story and come across it on DVD. So I buy it, go home and put it in the DVD player. Not as good as I remeber it but still a lot of fun and worthy of buying.The only real problem I have with the movie is the idea of how these monsters came to be. Just a little farfetched. Now I know that horror movies by there very nature tend to not be grounded in reality, but this one was just a little less believable then others. That aside, it was a truly fun movie and I would have to recommend it a any horror fan."
5,The best movie put on celluloid and then transfered to DVD,"This movie is without doubt the single best movie I have ever seen. The special effects were awesome and absolutely visually stunning. When I saw that C.H.U.D. stretch his neck two feet long for the first time it simply blew my mind, but the best thing of all has to be the way his eyes glow, the bright light shows the intensity of his soul and they look realy cool. Simply put, everyone should see this movie, or else!"
5,How robust can it get?,"I knew Angelo Pellegrini when i was a kid, and was frequently at the house for dinner, wandering in the garden, hanging out on the grape arbor covered patio, and helping to make wine...Even as a young girl, I found him fascinating, and to reconnect with him by reading The Unprejudiced Palate has been a great joy...Sure he advocates wine and rum for children, but Angelo's spirit lives on this in this wonderful book. Read it for the stories and the spirit...Read it for a unique perspective on American culture, read it because it will bring you joy and make you laugh...It made me remember how gregarious he was, how he and his family could sit in a restaurant, laughing and having the best time ever, not worried that they were too loud or boisterous...Can't we all just live like that?"
5,Unprejudiced palate?,"Ms. Waters says that the book should be called ""The prejudiced palate"", and I agree. Angelo Pellegrini's book is both a cookbook and a gustatory memoir. It reminded me of many foods that I have not had since I was a child growing up in southern Spain, including rabbit, and odd cuts of meat, impossible to find at the local market. This book is a must for anyone interested in basic cooking, able to find and use wonderful ingredients with minimum fuss. It is also a lesson in taking advantage of the bounty available in the US and using it to full advantage. It is a great read, funny and intelligent"
2,It is NOT Seagal's best.,"My wife LOVES Seagal so this was added to her collection. Not his best by a long shot, but it is a Seagal movie."
1,Completely wrong about Uruguay,"What is showed on this film is very sad.First of all Uruguay is in South-America, second we don 't have Guerrillas.....Our democratic system has been highly praised by europeans.. Our education is one of the bests of the Americas, and there 's no country other than Uruguay and Argentina, with more general knowledge in all the Americas.We don 't drop bombs and are a very peaceful country.This movie shows the world a bad and unreal image of our country.First of all, Steven Seagal should have gotten real information, before doing this fiasco."
1,Does anyone know where Uruguay is?,"This comment was originally posted by ANA on IMDB.This picture is based in a country with bananas, terrorists, tyrant government, Heidi's girls raising goats...COME ON!!! URUGUAY IS IN SOUTH America, and we raise COWS no goats!!! This is one of the most peaceful countries in America, that's one of the most particular characteristics of our country. We have nothing in common with BULGARIA (where it was filmed), we don't have Maya's ruins (that is in north America, please!!!), and we can't hide a submarine!! If you want to create a new country, be my guest! But you are showing this movie all over the world with bad concepts and a very poor history. Please...search a little more before you film a movie!!!"
1,"come on steve,you can do better.","I actually paid for this dvd,this by far has to be the worst movie he has done.Now don't get me wrong i am still the biggest seagal fan around.although he is not 28 anymore,i think he still can make some kick ass films.What he needs to do is stop having music video guys make his movies,and find a serious director."
4,Seagal's style.......,If you're a fan of Steven Seagal then you won't be disappointed. He always knows how to deal with the enemy and he'll do anything to reach his goal. It is too bad that Seagal doesn't use his Martial arts skills as much as he uses weapons most of the time.
1,offended Uruguayan,"For my dear Mr. Mihali R. PATSIAS ""Mick's Review"", you actually liked this movie??? Huh, it figures! you seem not to care in the least bit about the country where the movie takes place. Like many others have said, our democratic system is a reason for pride (nothing even remotely close to a dictatorship), our president might not be great, but he's not a dictator. Uruguay is definitely not an island in the Caribbean or anything like that, it is a country between two lovely neighbors, Argentina and Brazil (people, pick up a map!!!). We have probably the best education in the world, and the highest literacy rate in the world, but does the cast and crew of this film think we're stupid?? Do they think that the people from Bulgaria or Bosnia, or wherever this movie mas made are stupid? Stop making films trying to make foreigners look stupid!"
3,Looks Are Deceiving,"When looking at M Gantry, the first thought that comes to mind is ""hoochie mama"", with her hair cut short like a boys and dyed blonde, but a hoochie mama she is not. M Gantry is one of the best homocide detectives in Miami. She is known for solving the cases that are almost virtually impossible to solve. If a difficult case needs solving, she is the detective for the job.There is a serial killer on the loose in Miami and who better to put on the case than M? The biggest clue M has is the killer leaving behind half-smoked camel cigarettes. When M's partner becomes the latest victim, M does everything in her power to solve the case. As she gets close to solving the case she finds the killer may be connected to her past as well as her future.Hoochie Mama is a nicely written suspense novel with some surprising twists and turns.Reviewed by Eraina B. Tinnin"
2,Can't See for Looking....,"I must admit I have never read a mystery quite like Hoochie Mama. It was suspenseful however there were many shady characters and not many good ones. I found myself on several occassions going back through the book for clarification. The premise of the book, an art Professor and his wife were found murdered in their Opa Locka home. Det. M Gantry and her team were assigned the case until brass pulled her from it.With the unofficial direction from M, they proceed to work the case. Suddenly pieces are placed together and M wonders whether they should.I understand the author Preston L. Allen is working on a two-book sequel to Hoochie Mama, It is my hope he will update us on Det M Gantry's sister Sadie, come clean with this preacher & update us on the young boy David."
4,"Kinky Sex, Murders Galore,Very Focused Detective","I was introduced to the author by a short story he contributed to Las Vegas Noir. This was my first full length story that he wrote. The story starts off, to me, a bit slowly. But by the end the action is fast, furious and at times quite unexpected. Homicide detective M Gantry is an interesting person with an excellent crime solving mind. She won't accept the false leads that are placed in her path. It seems as though the Opa-Locka and Metro Miami Police Departments are chock full of bad guys trying to cover up for each other for past misdeeds. No one is too powerful to escape her dogged investigative determination. The author has a bit of an unusual tendency to intersperse important clues thruout the book. So you need to pay close attention as you read or you'll miss important things. All in all, quite interesting though a bit different than the typical murder mystery."
5,"This portrait by ""Crawfy"" is priceless!","Truly, this book is a national treasure and even the Queen should cherish it (apprently, she does not). After reading it, I have new-found respect for Elizabeth II and her family. No where else would you find such wonderful detail of the lovely lives these little girls led. Its also very revealing to see another side of the abdication of her uncle, King Edward VIII. I couldn't put it down and was left wanting more!"
3,"If you can get it at a cheap price (no more than $2.00), then it would be an ok purchase.","Very short DVD, and not as entertaining as the ""Dates from Hell"" one. If you have to make a choice on which one to buy, get the latter."
3,A Little Far-Fetched But Fun,I have read most of The Cat Who series and enjoy the cats and the fun concept. I thought this one was a little far-fetched in the storyline. It was a nice mystery and I always enjoy these books and read them right through in one sitting if possible. Some of them I have read over and over but this was not a favorite.
1,not the best,Not one of the better ones. Really shallowly written. Sounds like a ghost writer (the ghost writer's first book in the series) to me.
3,A mixed bag,"Here's what I liked: two mysteries going on concurrently, both of which have Qwill's mustache a-twitching; a new setting, a mansion with lots of closets to keep the cats occupied; Junior, one of my favorite Pickax residents, has a major role; Qwill as Santa.Here's what I didn't like: Polly is still a snooze, and I really could NOT care less about the nuts and bolts of putting on one of Qwill's corny ""radio broadcasts."" I hope that someday soon the residents of this small town get cable so that they, and we, won't be subjected to that distracting nonsense another moment."
3,hilarious,I could not see this done in anything else other than animation. A well put together cast with a hilarious adult humored story. Bernie Mac continues to make me laugh with his raw humor. What else could be funnier than a very young small white boy as a pimp? Take the time to watch this and I guarantee you will have quite a few laughs. Look for the boys pet rat too!
1,Oh my.,"Luckily I only rented this movie.Parts were funny, parts made me want to go get a refund from the videostore.Lots of scenes made me smack my forehead and think to myself, ""What the heck. That's so stupid"" or ""Ack! That's so wrong!"""
3,A technical examination of the myth of Lilith,I had more expectations for this book. The author quickly lost my respect as he spent much of his effort criticizing Barbara Koltuv's book on Lilith. His dry writing did not keep my attention for long. He did have some good points and info.If the myth of Lilith is your interest it's worth reading.
4,"Very Scientific, Kind of Vague","This book is pretty accurate as for the phisical mentions of Lilith in various places in history, but it would be a hard read for someone who isn't used to research jargon. I still found some of the findings vague though, rather inconclusive at times, sometimes stretching a myth to fit the tiniest possibility that it might be about Lilith."
1,Never received - very dissappointed,We never received a response to our emails regarding update on shipping of the item. Already charged credit card account back on June 6. Now August 6 and still no product!!
5,Extraordinary!,"Allen Weiss brilliantly illuminates five centuries of landscape architecture with Unnatural Horizons. This incredible work explores the relations between garden aesthetics and the metaphysical realm. Weiss situates himself at the symbolic matrix of landscape perspective -the place where poetics and science, natural beauty and art, politics and philosophy collide. The writing is excellent and flow of language exquisite. Unnatural Horizons is a tremendous work which provokes and endears. Highly recommended! A wonderful companion piece to his classic work -Mirrors of Infinity."
1,Buyer Beware,"As noted by a previous reviewer, there are multiple distributors of this title. One is ranked as superior while the other distributors are rated as inferior. Unfortunately when this kind of choice arises, and Amazon has these multiple versions available Amazon has the bad habit of posting the reviews based on the title of the film rather than matching them to the version being sold. So regardless of which distributor's version appears the same reviews are shown to the viewer. Be sure to check the distributor data to make sure you are ordering the version you want.In the case of this title Amazon does not identify the distributor so it is impossible to heed the advice the other reviewer posted as whether the item being displayed is the superior or inferior version.It would be helpful if Amazon would link the reviews to the actual item being sold in those cases where there are multiple versions of an item available. This would help drive home the poin"
4,A DANNY KAYE FAN,"I have just purchased The Inspector General. As i am still a 59 year old teenager i remember seeing it when it first came out. My favourite Danny Kaye movie is still The Court Jester but this is close second. So many funny characters including the great Alan Hale who will always be remembered as Little John to Errol Flynn`s Robin Hood. Elsa Lancaster as the Mayors wife, Gene Raymond ( with a wonderful hair style ) as the Mayor and of course Walter Slezak as phony medicine man who enlists the simple minded Danny for his wicked ways.Danny Kaye was always at his best playing characters who were certainly not the sharpest tools in the box. An absolute must for any Danny Kaye fans collection"
5,One Of The Best Comedies I've Ever Seen,"I first saw this comedy a couple years ago on television. It was in black-and-white format which detracted from the film a little for me. However this offering on Amazon is in color format.If you've seen and liked ""Court Jester"" or any of Danny Kaye's other classics, I assure you you will love this one.It is definately one of the best comedies I've ever seen and as I am 45 years old, I've seen a few.Enjoy!"
2,"remastered,not restored!","yes i fell for it,one reviewer described this release of one of danny kayes classics in glowing terms, i am always sceptical about the quality of non studio releases but i bought it after reading praise of the picture quality.big mistake,it is washed out and not the crisp clear colourful picture i was expecting.with a great deal of adjustment on my dvd player and plasma i managed to get a passable picture ,but beware... in general terms the picture quality is mediocre and not worth the cost involved."
5,FINALLY the way it's SUPPOSED to look!,"As a Danny Kaye fan, I've always been frustrated by the lack of a decent looking version of this seminal film on DVD. I suspect the other ones out there are bootlegged, but more likely the video company just didn't care because it's in the public domain and they had nobody to answer to.Thank you Shout Factory for caring. This print is the best I've seen--the technicolor is gorgeous and the picture is crisp. It makes an already classic movie finally collectible.The extras were unnecessary (for me) but it turns out they are superb. The director's son (ah, so they DID have somebody to answer to) provides an informative commentary over some incredibly candid home movies taken by his father Henry Koster on the set of the movie. Also loved the early DK short film ""Money On Your Life."" Man, was he young there, but so bursting with talent. All in all, a welcome release of a genuine treasure."
4,See SHOUT! FACTORY edition,"The high quality Shout! Factory edition was released recently and is available here:The Inspector General (Collector's Edition). That edition also includes home movies from the set and a 1938 Kaye short. Note, though, that some reviewers prefer the technicolor in the Roan edition release - if you can find it."
5,Danny Kaye is insuperable,"Danny Kaye is one of the best entertainers the movies have known. He is funny and has cabaret numbers (mostly by his wife Sylvia Fine)that are terrific. The Inspector General is one of the best Danny Kaye's movies. Based on an already hilarious play by Nicolai Gogol, the story is transformed by the inventiveness of the comedian and his partner, Slezak. As usual in Danny Kaye's movies, the story is funny, but is gentle and there are many moments (the selling of the elixir, the dinner) that will make you laugh unntil you cry."
3,ROAN release still superior,"Though released as a Collector's Edition, bearing some enjoyable supplementary material in the way of home movie footage from the director and an early short subject feature with a young Danny Kaye, the presentation of the film itself is disappointing. The colors appear to be off, with flesh tones redder than was typical of Technicolor.In comparion with the 2000 Roan release which seems to have utlized the same source material, yet managed to retain very pleasing technicolor hues, this new release falls short. Still, it is much better than previous low budget public domain releases, so less finicky fans may see this color issue as insignificant and the new release as quite satisfactory."
1,7.99 v ersion of the Inspector General,"Very poor visual quality. You get what you pay for, so buyer beware. Wish I hadn't purchased this."
2,in need of a remake,"I had watched some of this movie perhaps 25/30 years ago when life was simpler and I was simpler.The style of acting and the slow pace of the direction make this movie, in my opinion, unwatchable today.A far cry from the still mighty ""King of Jester"", still with Danny Kaye and a suberb cast and a movie that I highly recommendinstead of this one.The story by Gogol still great but we need a fresh look!"
2,Bad Movie,Excatly like all Danny Kaye's other movie only this version is notditgally remastered. Not worth the money.
1,Buyer-Beware!,"The DVD Quality is very poor indeed.The picture movement is unnatural/irregular and there is a zagging line on top of the film as well.I tried to email Reel Classic Films about my complaint,but I hit a Brick Wall(How convenient for them).Money Down The Drain.I will never purchase anything from Reel Classic Films,even if I live to be 1,0000 years old.It hurts more,since I live in Australia and the $A is not strong at the moment."
5,Still fresh and funny after more than fifty years!!,"Normally, I despise old movies. However, after listening to my kids quote line after line, and sing song after song, I decided that I absolutely must watch the movie. I was delighted! The comedy is fresh, not slapstick. The actors, though tempting as it might be to overact, were comic without goofiness. This movie is as fresh and funny today as it was in 1949. Now, I don't buy many movies, but I'm patting myself on the back for taking a risk on this one!!"
5,BEST SKA RECORD EVER (& I AM A CONNOISSEUR!),"Being 34 years old, I have been a dedicated SKA fan since 1979 (especially Jamaican) & had the opportunity to enjoy a few of Creator's tunes on several compilations and was desperately longing for a real Creator Album. Now that I got his ""Greatest hits"" all my friends turn SKA fans. Thanks to this immense artist for all the good time we all are enjoying. It's not only been a good surprise but has put some Jamaican warmth into the cold Swiss winter.We are all eagerly looking forward to his next record. If you should meet him, tell him all my respect and try to convince him to start re-touring and recording again. The audience is definitively assured.Again thank you Kentrick (his real name) for this jewel and all the emotion it gave us. And do it again !"
1,Not neccessary.,I bought this after I got pregnant thinking my belly would grow making my belly rings too small. Not the case. I never had to take out my original belly ring. The pregnant belly ring is completely unneccessary.
5,Perfect!,"This is just what I was looking for! As I read in other reviews, I cut the bar into two pieces. One was one-third the original size, the other was the remaining two-thirds. My intent was to start with the 'one-third' and if it showed signs of becoming too small I'd switch to the 'two-thirds'. Well I'm at 32 weeks now and I'm sure I will not outgrow the 'one-third' piece. Plenty of space."
2,"Sort of okay, I guess","The good:It arrived on timeIt's functionalThe bad:The ends were very tricky to screw on. I ended up having to use scissors to ship away at the bar in order to get the ends on. High maintenance!Also, the ends are really bulky and a very lumpy under clothing. No reason to have them that large.But - this is a hard item to find, so I at least appreciate that I have what I needed.Hope this helps."
5,What a great product!,"This arrived in 2 days- amazing customer service. I bought 2 of these pregnancy rings to use as barbells for my industrial piercing, and they're great. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a unique barbell to wear in an industrial/scaffolding piercing, as well as to any pregnant woman looking to preserve her navel piercing. Great product!"
1,Terrible Text Book,"I had to buy this book for my Music History class and I absolutely hate it. Also, I am disappointed because this does not come with the Listening Guide like the book says, it is just a workbook to try and keep you on track with what the Chapters were supposed to teach you. Unfortunately, from the text book you can't answer most of the questions in the guide. Like others have said, the language of the text book is incredibly vague. Important terms are not explained well within the Chapters or in the glossary. This book and the text book are a complete waste of money!If you HAVE to buy this book for school. Do future students a favor and express your hatred for the book when you have teacher evaluations. Unfortunately, there are few if any good Music history text books. So, if you have a music degree, know much about Music History and can write a straight-forward, easy to read book, you could make a killing in writing a college Music History book."
4,title,This book came to the campus post office on time and in good shape. I would buy from vendor again.
5,Good deal,"This book was in perfect condition. A very good deal for my college class, although it didn't come with the cd's, which was expected. BUT i just borrowed the cd's from one of my classmates and ripped them onto my computer. Much cheaper that way. I saved about 100 dollars!!! :D"
1,Not much help,This book was not much help to me when trying to learn about music of the classical and romantic era. The text is very vague and poorly written
2,A Disappointment Compared to Other Eco Novels,"I am a great fan of Umberto Eco, but I found ""Island of the Day Before"" to be a huge disappointment. Perhaps my expectations were just too high, after reading ""Foucault's Pendulum"" (a masterful work, in my opinion) and ""Name of the Rose"" (my wonderful introduction to Eco). Although ""Island of the Day Before"" has some interesting portions, it seems to lack cohesiveness in the novel form, and what little plot there is seems to drag on incessantly. Perhaps it would have been better told in an essay format (or as a series of short stories)? I thoroughly enjoyed the other Umberto Eco novels that I've read (""Foucault's Pendulum"" and ""Name of the Rose""), and I've liked reading some of his non-fictional works in semiotics/philosophy ... but, for me, ""Island of the Day Before"" was a great disappointment. I'm so glad that this wasn't my first exposure to Eco ... I would probably have never wanted to read his other wonderful novels."
5,Astonishingly Good,"Obviously, I'm quite different from the others who have reviewed this before me. However, I will concede that for perhaps 2/3 of this novel, I was fully confused as to exactly what was going on, & what Professor Eco was trying to say.I got it, very near the end of the book, & when it hit me, it was basically an epiphany. At that point, I broke down in tears, & realized I was on the verge of finishing a true masterpiece.I've read The Name of the Rose, Baudolino, Foucault's Pendulum, & Island of the Day Before, & consider myself a confirmed ""fan"" of Eco's. I actually prefer Baudolino to any of the others, but Island of the Day Before was quite profoundly moving, & my life is the better for having read it."
1,Boring (yawn),"This is the first book by Eco I've read and it will be a long time before someone can convince me to pick up another. While there were a couple of great scenes in the book, it was not worth the time and effort to get to them."
2,Bloated,"I wanted to like this book, but ultimately it is just too long, too confusing, and too self-indulgent to like. It revolves around a marooned man (marooned on a ship--while looking at an unreachable island) who confuses his own imaginings with reality--and confuses us a bit along with him. It seems to me that Eco took every little sophist philosophical musing he ever had and tucked it somewhere in this book. Clever wordplay, clever ideas--marooned on a ship, e.g. Christ trapped on the Island and waiting to be freed, e.g., all are thrown in as if in a blender. In the end we're left with a bloated dead body of a book. Unfortunate, if better edited and with 150 pages taken out, it might have been great."
1,A shipwrecked book,"The meanderings of Eco in this book are as dull as the main character. Literary devices used, like a strong interrupting narrative voice that pops up randomly, just seems heavy-handed and insincere. Having just finished his _Foucault's Pendulum_, I was very let down and had to speed-read the last chapters just to get through it without admitting I blew 20 bucks. We know you are brilliant and knowledgeable, Mr. Eco--you don't have to prove it--just tell us a good story."
4,My review,Island of the Day Before is my favorite Umberto Eco book. I couldn't put it down. I thought it was much better than The Name of the Rose.
1,"Interesting, but another point on a downward trajectory","Eco's ""The Name of The Rose"" was a dense but excellent multilayered novel of medieval thought, history and politics cleverly organized by a plot aimed more at revealing the mindset of a changing period than telling a 'story' per se. ""Foucault's Pendulum"" attempted, less successfully, to do the same thing. With this novel Eco appears to have concluded that history is interesting enough not to require more than the most casual of plots to introduce; he's wrong. We've seen most of these ideas before, especially the thinly-disguised mean-spirited anti-clericalism that fuels the novel's 'wit'. Eco desperately needs the discipline of working in the short-story format!"
1,Don't bother,"What an appalling bore this book was. 500 pages of a guy on his own slowly losing his mind interspersed with stories about imaginary brothers, what it feels like to be a stone (15 pages, the historical significance of doves in Greek and Roman mythology and wondering endlessly about whether such and such a girl thinks the hero is nice. The lead protagonist is as wet as dishwater. And there is absolutely no pay back from this book. If you want to know about telling the time at sea then read Longitude and give this book a miss. I don't have anything against Mr Eco per se - I have read and enjoyed his books before but this is the most boring history book I have ever read. and the fact that it is dressed up as fiction doesn't do it any favours."
2,Not up to standard,"I loved ""Name of the Rose"" and ""Foucault's Pendulum,"" but this one left me cold. It just didn't seem to hold all the twists and depth of the others."
3,Disappointing Work from a Master,"After being entertained by The Name of the Rose and absolutely blown away by Foucault's Pendulum, I had very high hopes for this novel. Unfortunately, although the intelligence and cleverness still come through, the narrative is just not that interesting this time around. Most of Eco's work can be read and re-read, and still remain delightful. I struggled to get through this one just once. Here's hoping for better next time."
2,Would Not Recommend To A Friend.,"While I'm no stranger to sophisticated literature and off-beat novels, the highfalutin concepts and boring storyline diversions in this book were even too much for me. The intriguing plot summary tricked me into thinking it would be a good read. I liberally skimmed the last 200 pages or so -- something I rarely do -- just to be over and done with it. Furthermore, it's a rather disappointing ending for such a looooong buildup. One good thing about it though, it's better than Nytol if you have trouble sleeping."
5,Eco still a brilliant genius,"I've expected The Island of the Day Before to be as stimulating as F.Pendullum and The Name of the Rose and I can see Eco has overmastered even his own linguistically brilliant self with his new novel. The Island.. is a feast of words, poetically served burst of stunningly original imagination. Again I found myself playing an imaginary intelectual battle with the autor (much superior in knowledge to my poor self of course) by trying to fully undestand each and every challenging passage by rereading some paragraphs over and over again. Some people complain the story of this book is too this but story itself is the least important of elements here. This book is about carefully selected words, about historical learning, poetry and world-wiews of the days long gone. As such, The Island.. is a stunning masterpiece with no equal in current literature."
4,Eco is slipping,"I read this book after Foucalts Pendulum and Name of theRose. They were both great books, and captivated me. It took a while to get into them, so I hoped that this would eventualy do the same. It didn't. It was a good book, but not as good as his others"
2,Very drawn out,Gripped my attention at isolated spots and bored me silly the rest of the time. Definitely feel that you lose a lot in the translation
2,the Land of the Dead,"At some point, nearing the end of the novel, someone arrives in the Land of Dead where souls suffer by deteriorating at infinitely slow rates and not having the ability to cease to exist completely. This is a pretty decent metaphor for how I felt approaching the last 100 pages of this book.I am someone who absolutely loved both ""Name of the Rose"" and ""Foucault's Pendulum"" and I, naturally, expected more of the same. If you're like me, you will not find it here. Maybe about 20% of the book is genuinely enjoyable, and it offers some juicy tid-bits thrown in that are only appreciable by people intimately familiar with ""The Three Musketeers,"" which, fortunately, I am. As for the rest, I often caught myself asking ""Why am I still reading this?"" For all my earnest suffering and faith, there was no payoff in the end."
1,A Waste of Paper,"I was wild about The Name of The Rose and Foucault's Pendulum. But this ""novel"" struck me as a literary experiment that should have been left unpublished. I agree with the reviewer who wrote, ""Interesting ideas, and beautiful writing, to be sure, but in my opinion not worth the effort."" If I could get to yesterday, I would leave this book unread."
2,Read a philosophy book,"If you are interested in Philosophy, History or Linguistics, buy a textbook, read an original or enroll in a course. If you want to read an engaging novel, stay away from this book. Sure it is well written and scholarly, but the one reason I could see for someone enjoying it is vanity. One must feel scholarly himself reading a thick novel from Eco. The truth is that the scattered gems throughout the book do not provide enough substance to make it stand as a treatise of medieval philosophy, linguistics or history.I have recently bought Baudolino, and I am still gathering the courage to give Mr. Eco another shot."
2,If you're studying vocabulary for the GRE read this book!,"Seriously. I was studying a box of 500 vocabulary flashcards in preparation for the GRE, and I swear Eco used that same box as he was writing this book. It really was good practice to go along with the studying, because I could actually see the words in context. Unfortunately that was one of the few redeeming qualities for this book in my opinion. This is only the second book I've read by Eco (the first being The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana), but I'm pretty sure it will be my last by him. There are too many good books out there to waste my time buying his books and feeding his ego."
2,The worst novel of one of my favorite authors,"I have simply loved every other novel by Umberto Eco I've read. I started with Foucault's Pendulum which I read in college and is still one of my all-time favorite books. Of course, I then went on to read The Name of the Rose which was also great.More recently I've read Baudolino which I thoroughly enjoyed as well - and which is a much easier read than most of Eco's stuff.I own The Island of the Day Before in a hard-copy that I bought at Half Price Books, and I'm sorry to say I still haven't finished it.I've forced myself to finish even some really horrendous novels, but for some reason I can't get through this. I'm such a big fan it bothers me and I can't help but wonder if it's Eco's fault or his English translator.My advice is to read anything else by Umberto Eco, but not this one."
2,Run away!,"The title, artwork and jacket of this book intrigued me enough to make me buy it. The premise of a man being shipwrecked on an actual ship is interesting--but the story falls apart after a description of how the hero got to be in his predicament. I expected a story and got a lot of history-babble that subtracted from the premise. I'm in the habit of finishing every book I start--and I found myself calculating the number of pages I would have to tolerate each day to get through it and on to some John Updike."
1,Spoiled plot,"After reading the Foucault's pendulum I was scaredto read another book of Eco. But this book is aneasy-reading one. The plot initially interestinglooses thrill with every further page and endsup in a mess of boringness. I cannot recommendit at all, even if it contains some interestinginformation on the development of navigation."
2,Pointless read with a handful of interesting tangents,"island of the day before is a waste of time. I am a fan of umberto eco, first having read his fantasy novel baudolino and then getting to the name of the rose.i was hoping for at least a somewhat straightforward narrative, but this was like switching off between an adventure story without a climax every other chapter, alternated between chapters out of a philosophy textbook.I am ok with tangents and rhetorical flights of fancy, but not within the context of a boring and meaningless story.skip this and read name of the rose.Josh Brownhttp://thereformedbroker.com"
1,Yawn yawn snorrrre,"Oo, trapped on a deserted ship near a mysterious island! you think, as you pick up this pretty, glittery book.But that's it. The protagonist, for the fifty or so pages I forced through, is just... there. Diametric to ""Foucault's Pendulum,"" neither action nor thought were at all compelling.I'll always have this pretty thing on my shelf, though, 'cause I'd be ashamed to inflict it on someone else."
2,An enormous disappointment,"I generally enjoy Eco's work. Name of the Rose was one of the best novels I've yet had the pleasure of reading. Focault's Pendulum was a little overdone, somewhat meandering, and ended poorly, but was nonetheless an extraordinary blend of the fanciful, the factual, and the metaphysical that left the reader uncertain where one ended and the others began. This book, to be frank, sucks. The parody carries the book for about 50 pages, the remainder is an exercise in boredom, meaningless (if occasionally amusing)ancillary tales, and a conclusion that is even more pointless than the rest of the book."
2,A fantastic journey to... where?,"Eco's style and fluidity are again inspiring. Oh to be Roberto! Some of the time. At times I find myself a stowaway, at times I'm an adventurer. Sadly, I'm only looking towards the end of the chapter so that I may put the book down at a convenient place and go to sleep. It took me two months to tredge through this disappointment. If only Eco could keep up."
3,Documentary about 5 students trying to pass the bar,"There are few lawyers, and no (drinking) bars. And it's not 'lurid'.So, there is some bait and switch here.This is an average, run of the mill documentary about 5 students trying to pass the california bar exam.If you're interested in the bar exam, this will be interesting. But I have no idea why the cover shows 6 awards for this documentary, because it's not unique or that fascinating, it's just ""60 Minutes"" type reporting."
4,A Very Good Look at Bar Prep Follies and Stressors,"If this video doesn't sacre and motivate you, don't even bother taking the bar exam!A Recipe for Religion"
5,Great book - started my dreams,"Like Navy Pilot said, I read this book when I was a kid and remember the vivid pictures depicting Navy life. I remember looking at the photos, which include a brief descriptive paragraph, and thinking ""this is something I want to do"". Military flying wasn't in the cards, but I'm currently a major airline pilot and attribute reaching my goals to this book. For anyone who has a love of aviation, or knows someone who is interested, this is a great book to light the fire.A quote I remember from the book, when he photographed the F-18, ""There are those who fly the F-18, and those who wish they did!"" I don't have personal experience, but after all these years that is a quote I remember.All in all, a great book, with great photographs, that will make a great addition to your library.I think I said ""great"" multiple times in this review. Need I say more?"
4,looking back,"i was wide eyed about this book. but.this book is about the beauty of the weapons systems.when i was older i understoodit doesn't have any of the truth of war in it.there are no crying people, no devastation and ruin."
4,"Well , it could have some unreleased track...","Umm , for the ones that really cares about having all the stuff of the Crows it is cool...new graphics and so on...I know that Adam didnt really wanted to have this CDS made but I am really upset of seeing no extra track . If you don't have AAW try it ! It has 3 of the best songs of the CD... Well , hope it help... See ya all Crows fans ! And Come the the Mailing List !"
1,Write on but not wipe off,"This product says write-on/wipe-off, but they have given the surface a matte finish that really provides a ""smear-off"" result. The words are wiped off, but a colored smear is left behind.Too expensive to return -- so will use and throw away. What a waste."
2,Not very interesting,"I've lived in DC for 11 years and was really hoping for a fun coffee-table book showing LIFE then and now. Instead, this book focuses on the big buildings, which pretty much all look exactly the same. ""Look! It's the National Archives in 1926! And in 2000!"" The difference? Color. And so on, page after page, same big impersonal building on the left (in black and white), exact same building on the right (in color). If anything, it's a testament to the consistency of stone and marble.To be fair, there are a handful of interesting (if standard) images: the swamps around the Lincoln Memorial, the early Capitol building, the White House with sheep, the old stone house at 17th & Constitution. But really, I've seen these before and they certainly aren't enough to justify the book.At least it's a nice looking, well printed book. I'll leave it on the coffee-table for now. I just won't open it much."
2,"Warning Paperback is very small (Compact), and the now picture are quickly becoming then...","Warning Paperback is (Compact) very small. Also the now picture are quickly becoming then aka dated now pictures-Buildings renovated; two buildings that I know of Capitol (Capitol Visitors Center), the DC Courthouse. I read 2007 publish date but I believe that this is a re-print date. As other review have stated the pictures are nice, but I also was expecting the same basic 'shot' now and then, not really the case in most of the shots with the angle and lenses now to then sometimes widely different."
4,Not quite the best,I was looking for recipes that was easy and none complicated. To many of the recipes had ingredents that were not alway in your pantry. I also have the next Lorna J. Sass pressure cookers cook book. This book is very much the same as this one. But it has much of the alike recipes.
2,Ingredient Problems,It is not for some who just wants to use a pressure to prepare every day meals. The majority of ingredients aren't what we find in the kitchen.Disappointment!!
2,I thought it was vegetarian-,"When I bought this book I though it was vegetarian, because that's what Lorna's previous books were with the exception of the first. I'm returning it, or hoping to sell it to a co worker. I can't give it as a gift because the only other people I know who are using the pressure cooker are vegetarians as well. Oh well- I am going to get her soy cook book though."
3,"Has unusual recipes, but...","Lorna Sass knows her stuff when it comes to pressure cookers. Her first pressure cooker book was great with lots of basic, down-home recipes and lots of basic information which is necessary for the beginner. However, this book is for the bored, more advanced cook. Recipes are a little more time consuming, with ingredients that one does not always have in their cupboard. I find that I do not use this book as much as some others. If you are just learning to use the pressure cooker, I would not recommend this book. Try her first book, ""Cooking Under Pressure"" or ""Pressure Cooking for Dummies""."
5,great way to create really fast food!,"This book really demystifies pressure cooking and allows you to create great dishes in only minutes. The corned beef is so lean, tasty and easy to slice that I never have any leftover. Ribs are falling off the bone and turkey chili is a real winner in my house. I didn't use my pressure cooker much before I got this book but now pressure cooking is the quickest way I get dinner on the table. The food in the Pressured Cook make great meals for entertaining too. And try the cheesecake. No one will believe that you can make cheesecake in a pressure cooker. If you eat it just out of the pressure cooker, it tastes just like a souffle."
2,Doesn't live up to the others,"I have ""Cooking Under Pressure"" and ""Vegetarian Cooking Under Pressure,"" so I thought surely I would love this book. Instead I was sorely disappointed. It contains the same stuff all over again, only this time the recipes are very meat- and fat-heavy. It's almost as if the author went backward in time instead of forward. Lorna, what happened?"
4,Great recipes for the busy person,"I think this is wonderful. I am a bsuy person who likes to eat well. I enjoy a bit of diversity and excitement in my food and this cookbook allows me to venture out of the""Box"". Everything is very tasty, easy to prepare and comes to the table in rapid time thanks to the pressure cooker. I have been a lover of pressure cookers for many years and Lorna Sass makes it a wonderful tool."
4,Healthy Pressure Cooking,Lorna Stass is the queen of pressure cooking. Lots of basics included for the beginner or the old pro. Recipes included family meals and company recipes.
2,Disappointed,"Maybe I should not be writing a review because I did not come close to reading the whole book. However, after skimming through and looking at many of the recipes, I did not want to try any of them. In addition, I did not want to have to figure out how to convert the recipes from this book that used older pressure cookers to my more modern one. Pressure cookers are supposed to be quicker and easier and this book made me feel like using my new cooker was more of a project than I wanted to take on. Maybe more avid pressure cookers will like this but as a ""newbie"", I was not impressed."
5,Lorna Sass does it again!,"There's something for everyone in this delicious collection of one-pot meals. I loved the ethnic influences. Even if you've never used a pressure cooker, you'll find the procedures easy to understand. Each recipe begins with a brief commentary that gives you a good feeling for what the dish will be like. The hardest thing is deciding which recipe to try first. They all sound so intriguing. One of my favorites is also one of the simplest--the scrod and corn chowder. The salmon variation to this recipe is also outstanding!"
2,This didn't work for me,"I am not experienced with a pressure cooker, let me say that upfront. I made several of these recipes. They were largely complicated, took a long time to put together, and required ingredients that I had to spend some time looking for at the store. To me, this defeats the purpose of a pressure cooker. For the time it took to make some of these, I might as well have done it in the oven or the stovetop. I am interested in fast, tasty meals from the pressure cooker, not gourmet pressure cooker recipes. If I want a gourmet meal, I know how to fix one the regular way. Unfortunately, the dishes, after all the effort, were very bland. It might have been me, or my inexperience with the pressure cooker, but this has been put away."
1,Disappointed,"I was hoping for a book offering one-pot meals that had ingredients from my pantry that is stocked with simple things. Coconut milk is not a staple in my shopping cart. I'd have a hard time serving a meat and potatoes kind of guy ""Fish Stew With Swiss Chard"". Not the kind of book for somebody that enjoys quick recipes with 5 or less ingredients."
2,Yuk on the bean recipes!,"Every time I try a recipe and it doesn't turn out, it breaks my heart. I borrowed this cookbook from the library looking for pressure cooker recipes for beans & legumes, but have had nothing but disappointment -- the three dishes I've tried have been bland or downright tasteless:'Red Lentils with Swiss Chard' -- bland'Asian Beans with Barley and Bok Choy' -- Yuk!'Chickpeas in and Eggplant Tahini Suace' -- Yuk!If you're looking for flavorful bean dishes, search elsewhere...Side Note: One of the recipes that other reviewers praise, 'Pork Vindaloo' is a modification of a recipe from Madhur Jaffrey's Quick and Easy Indian cooking. I love that cookbook and whole-heartedly recommend it. If you're at all curious about Indian cooking, pick it up... it's why I bought a pressure cooker in the first place."
4,Pressure cooking made easy,We have had a pressure cooker for a number of years but my wife was somewhat uneasy about using the cooker because it did not come with a receipe book. I have used the cooker a number of times but had to kind of guess on the cooking time for different foods. Lorna's book takes the guesswork out of cooking for both my wife and I. She is now more comfortable using the cooker.
2,Multi-Cultural Family Tree,"I found the cover alone of the book to be a work of art.Lara is about a woman who is going through self-discovery with her multi-racial background. In the book you see the Irish discriminating the English, the English discriminating the black. Inspite of this discrimination Lara's parents loved each other.Now reading this book is not simple.It is not Chaucer, or Shakespeare but the book has been written in poetry form.There is also a family tree diagram so that the reader could comprehend Lara's background."
2,"This buffing block is too large, bulky and ...","This buffing block is too large, bulky and awkward. It's difficult to reach all the areas of my nail in a uniform fashion. I've used other buffing blocks, and I feel this one is of very poor quality and does a very poor job. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone."
3,"Overall, I'd say the Orly Buffing Block is ...","Overall, I'd say the Orly Buffing Block is a great find. I rarely wear nail polish, but I do like a clear polish coat. During the time I've been using the buffing block, I've noticed an extra shine, almost like a silky sheen on my nails even before I apply the clear coat. I feel this is a very good product, especially for the price."
2,"Really didn't find it much use, sorry to ...","Really didn't find it much use, sorry to say. It has a nice low price, though. So if you're really crazy about perfect nails, perhaps this would be for you. I just didn't find it of much use. Maybe if you have a lot of ridges in your nails it would be useful."
4,I liked the product very much. It really ...,I liked the product very much. It really smoothes your nails. I used it before I applied tips and I usually have to apply new tips after two weeks. I'm on the 14th day and they're still going strong. The buffer really got all my nails' rough spots and the glue stuck better. I strongly recommend this product.
3,my review,"For a simple woman loving only to play music, life has dealt a very special hand to Elizabeth. First she is indicted for the murder of her millionaire husband, later she is the center of two man's lifes.Catherine Coulter has done it again. The plot is very entertaining and she keeps the suspense going throughout the book. The characters are real and express their emotions well. Good thing she does not mix any sexual direction with the main plot. It is truly a book of suspense and fiction.Good read."
3,Interesting characters,"I really enjoy CC and found even w/ my quibbles I was captivated to finish this book. I didn't care much for the hero, he seemed like a man taken from her historical novels and didn't fit well in contemporary settings...He was a jerk at the beginning, then instantly loved her, and I didn't sense the connection that CC was going for. She probably could have made Ro the hero and I would have received him better. What I was hoping most for was Adrian and Liz to get together, he sounded perfect!!! Overall, though, this was a book that kept me reading."
5,Summer reading,I first met Coulter as a romance novelist and enjoyed her books very much. I have to say I very much more enjoy her thrillers.
4,This book would make a good movie.,"An enjoyable and fun book to read with romance, intrigue and power throughout. I'm glad the character Elizabeth Carlton developed into a strong woman. As a reader you felt that you could identify with her and her judgements (after she got herself squared away). Some of the plot seemed predictable but it kept me hooked."
2,Could have been better!!,"The book started out good but by the second chapter I had already lost interest. I had to force myself to finish this book. The characters were poorly developed and the romance was almost non-existant. This book is not worthy of a purchase. If you must read it, I recommend it be checked out the library (I wish I had)."
5,"Catherine Coulter, a great novelist.","Catherine Coulter is my favorite author. False Pretenses is an earlier novel, and this was the second time I have read it. I've never read a novel of Coulter's that I didn't love. She has a special way of writing that is recognizable in each of her books. She's the best in her genre, in my opiniion."
4,tooth cleaning gloves,I'm always playing with my small dog(teacup poodle) and as a consequence my hand is in her mouth. I thought this would be an effective way to brush her mouth since she has familiarity(sp) with my hand. Alas the gloves are a little small for my hand but i can still get the forefinger in there for a scrub. I like this better than a tiny toothbrush and i get more accomplished. Recommended for medium to small hands
3,OK to use.....BUT,These are great to use if you have a dog that refuses to have his teeth brushed. You can slip your finger into the side of his mouth and brush away. One thing to be careful of is that you don't brush too hard......they are plastic bristles and dogs have sensitive gums - so make sure you brush lightly.
5,Fantastic Knife,The Henckel name has always been one I've trusted and this knife didn't disappoint. I love that they've changed the style of it such that food doesn't get trapped in between the handle and the blade. It is now all one piece. Fantastique!
3,you get what you pay for....,"I bought this knife feeling like $30 was a real splurge. It sharpens well, it sings, it looks cool, it has no rust after 4-5 weeks of use. But. It just doesn't hold an edge well! Also, it's made in China which is stamped on the blade and just annoys me. I was gifted with the Henckels Zwilling Pro knives - not going to lie - they're better. So - it's a pretty good knife for the money, but I think that from now on I'll save my money to buy the Fusion series - which are made in Germany - as I'm looking for a knife to use for 10+ years.Update: Now there is a teensy, faint little rust spot too. It's about the size of a pin head and very faint. But it's there. I would say I am pretty darn careful - I've had it close to a year and never put it in the dishwasher once."
3,J.A. Forged Synergy 8-Inch Chef's Knife,Quite sharp. But the point of the knife got broken when I cut something in a time. It doesn't appear durable like what I expect.
1,Already dulling after a few uses,"I've had this knife for about 3 weeks now, and have used it about 10 times since I bought it. Already, I can feel the blade dulling. I was unable to successfully slice a tomato yesterday without smooshing it a little.. how disappointing."
1,Disappointed!,"I bought this knife 1 week back. At the first use itself, I did not find the edge sharp enough.The more critical problem was with the handle. The handle is very smooth & is very difficult to get a good grip while cutting.Decided to return back!"
3,Wish it were made elsewhere...,"I wasn't aware this knife was produced in China. I was under the impression this was a German company (which it is), and that its products were made there. Turns out the knife is constructed, per the box, of German steel, but it is actually made in China. If I had known that I wouldn't have bought it.It was a gift so I've never used it....unaware of anything re how it cuts, comfort, etc."
1,worst knife ever!,"once it broke (!) so I replaced it. after it's got rusty (!) - maybe it's cheap but I would not buy it instead of you...I can't wait to buy ""global"" knife."
5,Works great and looks best on dvd,"I was very impressed by this format of the movie. True, it is printed on a dvdR, but it appears to professionally done. The quality is excellent. In one scene, you can see the snow falling. You couldn't see that on the vhs. I have tried it on two dvd players without issue. I cannot vouch for on a computer, but it works great on a home dvd player. Overall a very good buy."
1,Why I won't buy it...,I have always wanted a DVD of this Nutcracker ballet company. But when reading the specs they said it won't play on recordable DVD's or PC's. I have a home theater system plus another DVD recorder/player so I don't want to take a chance it could be ruined or I wouldn't be able to play. Bummer!!!
1,Very Disappointing,"I agree with the reviewer ""Diatonic"" - the prince looks like a lecher from Central Casting and moreover, Drosselmeyer came across as a creepy paedophile. I also disliked the character of Fritz, the little brother - instead of a mischievous little boy, he was a nasty, vindictive child.I found the camerawork particularly irritating. When I watch a ballet, I want to see the dancers' feet, not extended closeups of their faces. The voice-over was also totally out of place - traditonally, ballet relies on mime and dance to tell the story.I have several, far superior versions of the Nutcracker on DVD. The Royal Ballet Covent Garden's version by Fredrick Ashton; the Royal Swedish Ballet's delightful ""Christmas Goat"" version based on Swedish folklore; The Royal Dutch Ballet's ""Sinterklaas"" version; the Bolshoi's exquisite production with Nina Kaptsova and my absolute favourite, The American Ballet Theatre version with Mikhail Baryshnikov and Gelsey Kirkland."
2,Stay away,"Very mediocre production. The nutcracker, when he morphs into a man, looks like an old lecher, not a young prince for Clara. The dancing is passable but nothing more. And the various ""folk"" dances in the second part do not seem to match the music. There are far better versions available including the best one from the Kirov."
3,The one book you need at the end of the world,"While a little dry this book had a LOT of good information. Realistically it had too much information. A LOT of information that any highschool graduate will know.However, if the entire world social structure collapses this is the one book you would need to home school your kids."
3,A good but not great baseball book,"The one thing I really liked about this book is that it explores a little known aspect of baseball history in an engaging and enjoyable sense. However the book, coming it at a little over 200 pages really is nothing more than a Cliff Notes version of the founding of the Hall of Fame. Short thrift is given to the controversy about siting baseball's origins in Cooperstown. Also, highlighted synopsis of the orignial inductees seems to be either a rehash of old stories for Babe Ruth and a too short summary of the lives of some of the other lesser known inductees such as Nap Lajorie and Grover Cleveland Alexander to name two.This is a fun, easy read. I do wish the author had spent more time and given us a clearer more complete picture of everything leading up to the opening of the BHOF and some of the fascinating stories behind it."
1,There is a better book on this topic,"Reisler's leaden prose and lack of research make this a tiresome read. There is a much better book on this topic: James Vlasich, *A Legend for the Legendary: The Origin of the Baseball Hall of Fame* (1990)."
2,just okay,"I bought this based on good reviews, but this is just ""okay"" in my opinion. I would not recommend this brush."
5,Very usable in the classroom.,This is a very user friendly book with ideas that can be incorporated into the classroom with ease. It covers general topics so it can be used anywhere. I used it for freshmen in algebra and physical science.
4,MUCH IMPROVED SLIMFIT PICTURE QUALITY!!! NO BOWING!!! SAMSUNG DID IT AT LAST!!!,"I've owned this TV for about a week now and all I can say is the new TX-T2793H Samsung Slim-fit picture is much improved over the previous model (TX-T2782H).On this new model, there is only the slightest hint of bowing...hardly noticeable even under the most scrupulous eye - a vast improvement over the more obvious bowing found on earlier models.The 2793H model boasts great color, sound, and razor sharp picture...HD or non-HD analog!!!Hopefully, things will stay this way until next month and beyond...As of now, there are no other major flaws in this model. If anything else happens. I will update this review....AS OF NOW....I THINK SAMSUNG FINALLY DID IT....HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TV FOR EVERYDAY VIEWING!!!!!!"
2,"Great Artists, Bad Remastering!","The Lettermen are one of my all-time favorite groups,but in this collection, EMI Philippines tried to put28 songs in one CD, the dynamics of the tracks werecompressed too much, I have cassettes of the Lettermenwith better dynamic audio than this one. They shouldhave released this on two CDs. If you don't believeme spend your money and buy this and you'll start toappreciate cassette technology of years gone by!"
4,"Many Good Songs, Generally Good Sound","Twenty eight songs is a lot. All are good songs, but not exactly a ""complete hits"" album. The CD was produced in the Phillipines which may explain the inclusion of two non-English songs (Dahil Sa 'Yo and Ikaw).It is worth noting that the Lettermen scored highest on the Adult Contemporary (AC) charts but also did well on the Billboard Hot 100 (BB). There are ten hit single songs out of 20 that charted. All of the ten are well chosen, but I would have also included ""Come Back Silly Girl"" (AC-3, BB-17)and ""Put Your Head on My Shoulder"" (BB-44) and perhaps not included the non-English songs. One track, ""Going Out of My Head/Can't Take My Eyes off You"", is live.Sound quality is generally good, but there is a faint hiss on some songs and the volume seems to be too high (as noted on Audacity, a computer editing program).If you additionally purchase ""The Lettermen Greatest Hits - 10 Best Series"", you will get four more charted songs, but that CD contains only 10 tracks."
3,Just the music.....,"I started out as a BIG fan of this group; and remain a huge fan of the music. My problem is that the vox sounds like Ozzy with a sinus infection. The more I listen, the less I can take it. What is the deal? The voice does not even sound human at times, as though it is overly filtered and processed. Is that necessary? As I said, the music and musicianship are fantastic.....but I can't get past the vocals; sorry guys! Lose the processing, and sing the music as it should be. There is only one Ozzy; do we really NEED another?"
3,This singer is no OZZY,For everyone that says this guy sounds like OZZY you must be out of your gourd. The music rules but I can't stand the overuse of effects put on the singer's voice.
5,You don't know what you're missing!!!,"Buy this album if you are into heavy stuff! Yes, there is a resemblance between singer Hennessy and Ozzy, but there is MUCH more in Sheavy's music than that. Gigantic bulldozer riffs and great solos, good lyrics... this band ROCKS, and could easily be labeled as any '70s heavy-rock bands such as Sabbath, Buffalo, Blue Cheer, Mountain etc. Satisfaction guaranteed!!!!"
4,rocking album,"Ok, I've listened to this album a few times now and feel I can write an informed review. I've been a fan for at least 5 years and find this album fits in with the others. I still like the other 2 albums more so far, but this one holds it's own. It's different from the other 2 in that I think it's a little less heavy and more experimental. I don't understand the reviews complaining about having too many effects on his voice; the only song with effects is ""Set Phasers to Stun"", unless he's running through effects all the time, which I don't know. His voice sounds just like it does on the other albums. Most vocals on albums are run through some kind of effect(s), but I doubt they would go so far as to ""make"" him sound like Ozzy. They are supposed to be touring in 2005 so we should get to see if he really sounds like Ozzy or if it's a studio creation."
4,Black Sabbath's missing album....,"Of course these guys sound like Ozzy and Co., but they are not ripping off old Sabbath records. Instead, they are creating them.""Synchronized"" is the album that should have been in between the groovy ""Sabatoge"" and the almost unlistenable ""Technical Ecstasy"".All in all a very nifty album, especially the title track which is on my list of greatest driving songs ever!"
1,Only for beginners,This book is good for beginners:- Description of 8051 processor- Hardwareinterfacing an description- Examples in C and ASM- Assembler instructions from Intel (same as in 8051.pdf)I was searching of bulding a Multitasking 51 system but in this book was nothing written.
1,HORRIABLE!,"AWFUL, an id meen awful. Dosent look anything like the pictures, cheap. Came with broken pieces and the ones that were broken were within 10 minutes. The caulking mechinism actually fell off while I was shooting. Horriable. They have all this stuff that you need to put on and they dont even tell you how to put em on.The best part of this thing was the screwdriver"
1,didnt but but say on the thing 200fps!!!,"200 fps!!!!! wtf thats nothing there are better guns out there for cheap prices too, like the m14, cost 40 dollars, 400fps, and the m16 with grenade launcher, full and semi auto machine gun, shoots at 320fps, cost 50 dollarsand if you dont like those just save your money for a tokeyo maurie great great guns! only like 250 bucks for a pretty good gun"
3,Too Big!,I'd prefer that this case fit my HP laptop a little more snugly. It's way too loose for my HP Pavilion. A handle would also be nice. Well constructed and the zipper accessory compartment is great.
1,BAD!,"This product was supposed to be new, but when I got it the zipper was already broken. I sent it back in, and when I received my money back they didn't even refund me for the shipping. I will never use this seller again, and I encourage others not to. Very bad service."
3,"NOT for 15.4"" macbook pro","I do believe that the whole purpose of a laptop sleeve is so that the laptop inside would not slide so much. Once I received this sleeve, I immediately put my Macbook Pro in and it left a good 2""-3"" space near the top. [Also, the Case Logic label sewn inside the side of the sleeve seem like it can potentially leave small scratches on the surface of the laptop].So I returned it and placed another order for a Case Logic laptop sleeve that is especially sized for the 15.4"" Macbook Pro [Case Logic - 15.4"" Macbook Pro Shuttle]. I'll see how that goes and compare the differences..."
4,"Nice, BIG laptop sleeve","Ordered it for the extra storage area (with it's own zipper) and I love that part about it. Could basically use it as a daily laptop case if you stick the power adapter in there.It's not as thick/tough as maybe some other sleeves, but in my case this is just for rare use or to cover my laptop if I need to throw it in a backpack/suitcase.It is a lot bigger than I thought, though. I saw the measurements and figured my 15.4"" T61p with the 9cell battery would pretty much fill it up, but there is almost 1.5-2"" of room in there length wise. It's not such a bad thing because it allows more stuff to fit in there, but if you want a firm/tight sleeve, make sure you take a close look at the measurements."
2,Can children really love a man like Mr. Belvedere?,"The jack of all trades and self-proclaimed genius Mr. Belvedere is appealing enough, but can a stiff man with admitted contempt for children be truly loveable? None of his unconventional methods of child discipline would account for the doting behavior of the three boys, and that's mainly why I can't recommend this movie. Every character has their appeal, but as a group, it's difficult to believe they interact as well as they do. And the problems that do crop up are equally unbelievable: How could Robert Young be jealous of a rigid fop like Mr. Belvedere? The fantasy of an uber-nanny appearing mysteriously to enrich our lives and control our household is worthy of a suburban comedy like this, but the story here just doesn't use the possibly delightful premise as well as it could. The ending is much too pat without the absurdity that a Preston Sturges would make of it (like the dual marriage at the end of Palm Beach Story)."
5,Clifton Webb is a scream,"This is not a particularly well-known movie any more, but it is a great film worth buying and enjoying. Clifton Webb plays the prissy and effeminate Mr. Belvedere, a no-nonsense butler who moves into Robert Young and Maureen O'Hara's home to watch their bratty sons. Webb immediately instills discipline into the home and the boys end up adoring him, even if he is a martinet. The hilarious scenes he finds himself in... delicious!Clifton Webb's comedic timing is underrated and the plot twists and ancillary characters will entertain and delight you throughout. This is one of the best sleepers from the 1940's and will have you laughing from beginning to end."
4,DVD please,I would buy at least one copy if Sitting Pretty were available on DVD.I will NOT buy VHS any more.
5,Great family entertainment,"Appearances can certainly be deceiving, as this story illustrates. This very funny, well acted movie makes you realize that the least likely person can have hidden talents no one would ever suspect."
5,One of the Best,I have been looking for this movie for what seems like forever! Thanks Amazon! Very funny classic movie! Mr. Belvedere is a hoot!!
2,Ok but came beat up,"well the mask is pretty sweet but the mask came with a cracked lens, a broken strap, and the eye wholes leak. I did not send it back because I was not planning on using it for actual protection from toxic gases, but for show. I also did not want to wait another 2 weeks for it. The shipping was 8 bucks and the mask did not come for about 2 weeks. This was very annoying to wait on. In all the mask was way to expensive for the quality It had."
1,defective unreturnable merchandise,"Delivered to me today were two Belgian gas masks with broken lenses. I was informed that they cannot be returned.The masks and the cartridges looked defective and previously used. I cannot help concluding that the dealer ""Allergy be Gone"" is not selling these to use for protection.Whoever used these in an emergency will not know any better because he/she will be dead."
2,IT WAS CUTE!!,"If you like romantic comedies, you will think Mr. Wonderful is cute. its not the best, but the acting was pretty good, although the Supporting Actors and Actresses was even better than the main characters. the plot wasnt really anything special but it was good enough. i recomend it for a one time viewing"
2,What is matt dillion doing in this movie?,The plot is boring. Dont watch this movie it drones on. Matt dillion is too talented and this movie does nothing with him.
5,DVD review,THis is an excellent DVD - in mint condition and met my expectations and was very reasonably priced.
2,Sleepwalking,"Anthony Minghella (Truly, Madly, Deeply; The English Patient; The Talented Mr. Ripley) makes movies with a lot of heart, but I can only guess he was sleepwalking through this one. I found the protagonists unlikeable and cringed every time they started shrieking at each other. Dillon plays a commitment-phobic (wow, we've never seen that in a man before) ConEd worker whose main hobbies are banging his much-too-nice-for-him nurse girlfriend and yelling at his ex-wife, the lovely Annabella Sciorra.Solid supporting cast, though, with the ever-excellent Vincent D'Onofrio as a pharmacist most any woman would fall for and Dan Hedaya as a ConEd co-worker. Both make the most of the thin material they're given to work with."
4,Very cute!!!,"This is a sweet and charming film; only the ending disappointed. The entire film and premise was so different from other romantic comedies, and the leads and supporting cast are fantastic, but the typical overly sugarcoated ending ruined it. I expected better considering the rest of the film. Overall though, this one is recommended over recent Hollywood romantic comedies. It definitely made me smile."
4,"Bald IS beautiful, baby.","When I first picked up Deadlands, I felt somewhat cheated by the fact that most everything in the Marshal's section comes out to ""This secret will be revealed in Lost Colony."" Then I went back and read some of the older stuff and realized that it was basically designed to be a play in three acts, and that I had come in on Act Two. (I first got into the game via Hell on Earth.) Well, this book will give you some background on Faraway from the folks who were actually there. That's it's main value to me. Beyond that, it's the standard Deadlands class book. Quite useful, new edges, hinderances, and abilities. And, of course, the special adventure just for that class at the end. For me, though, the book was worth it for the background."
5,"A Gateway to Dewey's ""Tertium Quid""","Although many essays (and anthologies of essays) have appeared on the topic of classical pragmatism versus neopragmatism, this is the first book-length project I know of to tackle the controversy from a viewpoint fully conversant with and sympathetic to Dewey's signal contribution. It is quite refreshing to discover a scholar who not is not only aware of, but champions, the vital Deweyan conceptions of having versus knowing, primary experience, and the centrality of inquiry. Hildebrand's grasp of Dewey's engagement with direct and critical realism is exemplary, and his ""deconstruction"" of Rorty's antirealism is nothing short of amazing-""wicked"" comes to mind! Although Hildebrand's alternative ""practical standpoint"" falls short, in my view, of Dewey's full transactional integration of experience and nature, this book opens up an area of research of vital importance. It is well written, informed, and cogent."
4,An interesting twist,"This tale is perfectly suited for fans of Tales from the Crypt. It is a blend of frights, gore, and humor. Billy Zane is the Demon Knight sent to acquire the last of the keys which will unleash the darkness. This is a wonderful movie for Zane fans, as he allows his mesmerizing dark humor to come to the forefront. Jada Pinkett shines as a tough but caring parolee. The movie is very much in the manner of Tales from the Crypt, so if you aren't a fan of tongue-in-cheek, this is not the movie for you. But, if you are looking for a horror film thats just a bit absurd, this is a solid choice."
4,"""Good 90's Horror Flick!""","Billy Zane, William Sadler and Jada Pinkett starin this 1995 horror film. A drifter and a groupof people are trapped by a demon looking foran ancient key. This is a good film and Billyand William are great in it. This dvd hasgood picture and sound, but only thetrailer. I recommend this."
5,I Wish There Would Have Been A Part 2,This very original movie was such a breathe of fresh air in the mid 90's when other so called horror movies were playing it safe. The ultimate battle between good and evil comes to a small road side town HO-tel. Billy Zane is great in this role as well as the supporting cast and the very lovely Jada Pinkett. The atmosphere in this movie fits so well. Very dark scenes and gore galore with a great plot turns out to be a great modern horror movie. The biggest crime is that there was only one installment. I want to know more!!!
2,"""Theme true-delivery not""","I wasn't prepared for all the profane language in the movie. The graphics were not for the faint of heart. I got the general message of the film, but the delivery was way off to me. I ordered the movie because I had heard so much about the theme of how the devil uses what be in us to capture our very souls."
5,Welcome Horror Fans,This is the first full length movie to tales from the crypt. this movie is awesome. i loved the story the characters and espicialy having john kassier play the cryptkeeper. this is just a fun movie to watch. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
5,Prepare to Take on the Unholy hords,"This movie came out when I was twelve and in the beggining it scared the living fluff out of me. But for some strange reason I found myself watching it over and over again. The story of this movie created a fantasy in my play world around my house battling any evil spoil on the earth. The story is a basis of gore and action, with great fight scene's and mad demonic posetion. Derived in a run down Hotel a small party of people are found in the hands of a ipocolyptic Deamon that is bent on takeing all ther souls. And one soul heroin that is desdend to be a Demon Knight."
4,Good reference!,I bought this book as a reference for clients and I found my self reading it completely in a few days. It is a very good book...If you want to have good communication with your child or adolescent this book is for you...it gives you ideas and activities of how to increase kids self esteem and confidence. I want to keep it close to use it with my daughter.
5,A Great Book for unique ideas for building children up,"I can't believe no one has reviewed this book yet. I've had it for years, and often keep it bedside. It has great ideas for unique games of building self esteem and self reliance in children. I recommend it highly for parents of children of all ages."
5,Exact OEM Match,"This matched the manufacturer's fuel filter exactly. Changing a fuel filter should be done in a well ventilated area and you are guaranteed to spill some fuel. I changed my filter at about 40,000 miles because I wasn't sure what octane the previous owner used. Vehicle: 2007 Mustang Convertible GT 4.6l."
1,Has No Smell,"I have been using this fragrance for many years! It's the type of scent that everyone reacts to, in a positive way. Men follow you and ask you what you are wearing and woman want you to write it down so they can buy it.The 2 bottles that I received were obvioulsy very old. Neither had a scent. You would have thought it was colored water! I guess I will have to go back to the store and pay more for the product, but at least it will smell like it's supposed to!"
3,NOT Schuller's best,"This is not Schuler's best book. I am fan of his weekly show, ""The Hour of Power"" and while his previous books have been outstanding, it's because most of them have dispensed practical advice and positive attitudes to his readers. As you can see if you watch his show, though, he seems to be getting a little more ""loony"" with age, for lack of a better term, and ""Don't Throw Away Tomorrow"" continues on that path. This is less his typical style of writing and more a pat on the back for the celebration of the 50th anniversary of his ministry, which don't get me wrong is well-deserved, and also an extension of his autobiography of a few years back, ""My Journey"". A little too much ""rah-rah-sis-koombah"" for my liking in this book. But it's Schuller, so if you like him, I recommend it still. Just don't expect anything new."
5,Triple beauty,"This book's a beauty, three times over. The content is really wise, the layout of the book itself is most attractive, and, last but not least, the translation is as smooth and subtle as silk. A winner on all three accounts!"
2,A super model with a not so super book,"Fabio will best be remembered for his pictures on romance covers and for his own crisp style of prose, not to mention his dynamite jazz album that ""mysterious""ly went out of print...guess Miles and Thelonis couldn't compete... even so, I am puzzled by Fabio's new direction. Some of these essays are profound, and I am not sure how a man of Fabio's genius has remained undiscovered for so long. Yet even so, I was not impressed with his ultimate conclusion on the meaning of life. He was right when he said ""life is romance"" and he should have left it at that."
5,The Open Doory by Evanescence,I love this CD! I also got fast delivery with this order and I am very satisfied with my purchase.
4,Excellent music,Excellent music from an excellent singer. I have always loved the voice being Evanescence and some of these songs are some of my favorites in the whole genre!
4,diffrent,I love how the music is very diffrent then most and the singer on here her voice is amazing. would listen to this alot
4,something of interest,"I was sampling the tracks and for the most part they sound pretty good so I rated the cd a 4 since I haven't really heard it. I was just wondering if anyone else noticed that on ""Lacrymosa"", the background string and choral parts are Mozart's requiem mass. I'm almost positive they are exactly the same and I thought it was a interesting touch to add to the piece since the requiem mass is one of my favorite Mozart pieces and is very emotional and dramatic. I'm sorry that this isn't much of a product review, but rather more of a interesting detail that I noticed."
2,"No, no, no!","And I had to wait how long?! Fallen was amazing, touching, and inspirational. I listened to many of the songs on that album 100s of times. I searched and found every other song Evanescence ever released and listened to those too. I went to two of their concerts. More than one of their songs has brought me to tears. In many of those songs it seems as though Amy was compelled to expose her deepest feelings through song under pain of death. She sang her heart out, you could hear it in her voice, you could hear the feeling. No song on ""The Open Door"" asks to be listened to more than once. There is no energy, there is no emotion, there is only a bland, predictable, and absolutely ""perfect studio"" Evanescence sound. AAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRGH!"
3,Decent album but not as good as the first,Pretty good album. Not as good as the first one by any means.
4,"Great follow-up, but needs time to grow.","Everyone and their mother wants to compare this album to Fallen, and rightfully so. Fallen was amazing in every way. As another review said, Linkin Park-ish and dark.TOD is different however. Shedding their Linkin Park ripoff label, Evanescence seems to have returned to their darker roots - their older stuff. This album sounds more like ""Even in Death"" or ""Away from Me"" rather than ""Bring me to Life"".Not to say that this is a bad thing. Unfortunately, those, like myself, who were expecting a hard hitting Fallen part 2 will find that this album will take some time to grow on them.The music from this album really grabs you when/if you get to see them live. My appreciation for the album didn't hit until I heard ""Sweet Sacrifice"" and ""Lithium"" from the stage. Pure gold.4 out of 5 stars for the departure from the norm/expected yet still making great music."
5,"Ben, why didn't you leave the band sooner?","I'm shocked, I mean, for years I loved ""Fallen"" because I really though it was the best Evanescence would come out with, great vocals, great guitar solos, awesome lyrics... Everything was great then, but now my eyes are open. ""The Open Door"" is a masterpiece and no matter what some so called ""Fallen"" fans say, this album takes Evanescence into another level, where you find bands like Lacuna Coil, Nightwish and Within Temptation. All I have to say, thanks Evanescence! Ben, believe me, we won't miss you.Masterpieces:- ""Lithium"" - ""My Immortal"" seems so ridiculous now.- ""Lacrymosa"" - Mozart, you would cry now, wouldn't you?- ""Lose Control"" - An ""avant-garde"" song, unique and diferent.- ""The Only One"" - More melodic than any song on ""Fallen"".- ""Your Star"" - Evanescence became finally huge!""Fallen"" seems a total garbage now, ""The Open Door"" is here to stay!"
3,"Fallen, much better","Their previous album fallen it's much more better than this one... this album is much more slow and more boring if i may say so... I was expecting more from them, but has a couple of good songs in it"
4,"Good, but there's room for improvement","I liked Fallen. Mostly because Amy Lee added a new dimension to the pedestrian hooks, though. And ballads like ""My Immortal"" had haunting melodies. The Open Door captures the essence of Evanescence better. The songs rock, but in a less contrived way, and Amy really soars behind the spooky sound effects. Those sound effects might get a bit much over the entire CD, but for Halloween, there are no complaints. Yes, the lyrics are more depressing, but this is not sunny pop music. So to sum up, more of Amy Lee's influence means a better Evanescence."
5,worth the wait,"This album was completely worth the wait . Amy lee covers all points on the spectrum and her voice is amazing to say the least.from Sweet sacrifice all the way through to good enough, thers not a bad song on this cd in my opinion."
5,A welcome departure from Fallen,"If you came in expecting Fallen, you were either happily or sorely mistaken. In this album, Amy Lee and company have shown a much greater emotional and musical range, and this is much better than the merely above-mediocre outing in Fallen. Also, it seems that this album is missing some of the artistic conflict of the last album. I'm glad they've finally chosen whether they want to be a hard alternative rock band or a Christian alternative band. I really don't know what to say other than that which has been said better by others, but for my money, this should win Album of the Year."
3,"Good, but not 'Fallen'","Normally, I would listen to an album like 'The Open Door' and give it five stars. However, Amy Lee and friends set themselves a hard act to follow with 'Fallen', and 'The Open Door' falls far short of the mark. Ben Moody is a god among songwriters, and - as I expected, but hoped otherwise - the music has suffered without him. 'The Open Door' is good. 'Fallen' was sublime, superb, haunting, melodic, beautiful, intense and a plethora of other adjectives. Given the radio airplay of 'Call Me When You're Sober', 'The Open Door' will probably do very well. But don't look for another 'Going Under' or 'My Immortal' here... 'cuz you won't find it."
1,Huge disappointment..,"The result is musically dull melodrama with nothing to give it worth other than Amy's fabulous voice. Considering how good ""Fallen"" was and how long fans had to wait for the second release, this is a huge disappointment. Because, bad songs, bad sound and bad product. That's not OK.I suspect the change in line-up has a lot to do with this; the real musician/songwriter obviously left the band. I suspect that this is the last we will ever hear from Evanesence. Hopefully, Amy Lee will do better with her next project."
2,Disappointing Second (Third) Album,I loved Evanescence's first album Fallen and their previously unreleased album Origin. My biggest fear since being a fan in the early days was that their fame would have them churning out sub standard music. And now that's happened. This album is ok. It's not terrible but it's lacking the soul that they used to have. This feels like a mass produced album to make money rather than a heart felt musical expression.
2,"Evanescense tries, but doesn't deliver","""The Open Door"" is one of those albums that you really try to like, but I obviously can't take it. Amy Lee's vocals are deeply personal, but sometimes a little too personal. It seems like this album mostly showcases her break-up. Also, there aren't enough rocking tracks. The only two I noticed are ""Call Me When You're Sober"" (which I am getting sick to death of hearing on the radio), and ""Sweet Sacrifice"". If you want an awesome female goth band, I definitely suggest Lacuna Coil, The Gathering, or Queenadreena."
3,The Door is not so Open...,"When I first listened to this album, I thought the first track was pretty strong and had high hopes for the rest. I also really liked the single, Call Me When You're Sober, but as a whole, the rest of the album just failed to grab me. There were plenty of Ok songs, but not many that were above average. I think Fallen was a significantly stronger album musically and was fairly disappointed by this effort from Evanescence."
3,Something's lacking....,"I'm underwhlemed by this album overall. The guitar chords sound too heavy to me, like Amy is straining to sing above them. And the band hasn't tried very hard to break out of the mold they made for themselves; a lot of the songs sound an awful lot like their old ones. And I think the lyrics for most of the songs are very trite.That being said, it's still nice to hear new stuff from Evanescence. I do love ""Lacrymosa"" because I've always had a thing for Mozart's Requiem, and they intigrated the old Lacrimosa into their song nicely. And I really, really like ""Good Enough""-- something about it touches me deeply, and I've always preferred their acoustic stuff anyway. Personally I think Amy Lee should ditch the rest of the band, grab a piano, and start a solo career aimed towards an older audience."
2,What on Earth Happened?,"This album lacks all of the heart-wrenching emotion of the first one. The whole thing seems forced and unnatural; I am truly disappointed; my apologies, Amy."
4,"Evanescence : ""The Open Door""","I'll make this short and to the point. I think ""The Open Door"" is a very solid effort all around. It starts out very strong, the production is great, and Evanescence sounds as good as ever musically. Very solid 2nd effort all around....The only complaints I have is that a lot of these songs sound the same after a few listens, and as a whole they don't seem to run together as well as they did on ""Fallen"". Oh well, all things considered it's an enjoyable listen, and an admirable effort. I hope to see them live this year!!!...."
4,VERY IMPRESSIVE,"This album is the best one I own. The lyrics are deep and Amy Lee's voice is amazing. To be honest this album needs replay of all the songs. When I first heard the album I thought wow ""what a let down"". But then after some replay all of the songs grow on you. I think because we all had such high expectations, anything under what we expected would be terrible. If you first hear this album and dislike it, replay it a couple of times because you will begin to adore every song.STAND OUT SONGS-""Call me when your sober""""Lithium""""Snow white queen""""All that i'm living for""""weight of the world""Over all this album blew me away. I have listened to the album non-stop since It's release date. It will be the most played album in your collection. The albums singles in order will be""Call me when your sober""-""Lithium""-""Sweet Sacrifice""-""Lacrymosa"""
3,Disappointing compared to Fallen,"Fallen is one of my all time favorite CDs. I still listen to it now as much as when it came out a few years ago. After listening to The Open Door it seems obvious Ben Moody was the better song writer. The sound is still there: raw, dark guitar, haunting piano interludes and Amy Lee's amazing voice. But the songs simply aren't as good. Most of them are unfocused, never sure where they are going or how to get there. So many shifts, from slow to fast, loud to soft, metal riff to operatic aria and all in so little time that it jars you. The songs aren't bad which is why you can still enjoy The Open Door, but they aren't up to the standards of Fallen which is why this is a disappointment. I'd say ""Sweet Sacrifice"", ""All That I'm Living For"" and ""Good Enough"" were the songs that grabbed me the most."
3,Not much variety,"While I like the Evanescence sound, it seemed that all the songs sounded roughly the same. It'd be cheaper to buy one or two off of iTunes."
5,Another Great Evanescence Album,"I am ecstatic about my purchase of this album. I got it just days after it was released on Oct. 3 and have listened to it 10 times already. Even after many listens, it is still FAR from boring. Like ""Fallen"", this is another masterpiece and I don't think I will ever get tired of it. It is haunting, creative, dark, emotional, heavy, melodic, and more. Amy Lee can add such dimension to a word with her voice, it is phenomenal. They may have lost a member of the band, but it does not show in any negative way. This album is every bit as good as ""Fallen"". It is hard to match hits like Going Under, Bring Me To Life, and My Immortal, but overall, ""The Open Door"" matches it. If you liked ""Fallen"", you will love ""The Open Door"". Get it new now at the low price found here at Amazon. I did, and I am VERY satisfied."
3,They didn't live up to their potential,"I loved Fallen, it is still one of my favorite cd's I had to buy another copy because I wore out the first! This cd will never get worn out I was really dissapointed in it. We know that they have potential and they didn't live up to it. It sounds like Amy Lee forgot half of the words to the songs and she is just mumbling along. Some of the songs are good, I recommend previewing the songs and just download the ones you like, you can live without the rest of it, that way it will only cost you a couple bucks."
1,Cacaphony of Crap,"Only one star because 0 is not an option. Hmmm, Lets see here! An Over-emotional, whining, drama queen front person backed by a tragically unimaginative NU-Metal band. Why is everything she sings sound like whining. I actually owned Fallen and there were a few choice tracks on it, but it was the long winded, drawn out, sanity peircing vocals that forced me to throw it away, couldn't even give it away. The same goes for The open Door. The direction may be a little bit different but its just as bad, only now she sings multiple tracks over herself which kinda gives the impression that if she was any more full of herself, there would be 100 of her. Not to mention the fact that just one vocal track was annoying enough. So, as the cover suggests, Magical Mysterious Commercial Goth Queen enters a huge magical smokey doorway to Narnia, Someone should close and lock the door behind her! Enough already!"
2,Any more than 2 stars and you are just an Amy worshiper.,She has a killer voice and backed up with the real world passion of her origional back was a match made in heaven. This new thrown together corporate money grabber depends on the briliance of Amy's voice to sell it. Just another example of hype for the masses. This album has no teeth. It makes great mall/elevator music though.
3,Playable - but not impressed,"First off, I loved the Fallen album. However, this album was a bit disappointing compared to their debut. I listen to a lot of music at my desk while working, but with this album, the intros to a lot of the songs seem to be too similar. I had to check multiple times to see if I had my mp3 player on repeat, because I felt that I had already heard a song before. The style on this album is too homogeneous for my tastes. The music and the lyrics simply did not grab my attention the way the first album did."
5,Another Favorite!,"What I feared was that the song writing would have suffered when Ben Moody left, but it hasn't. Evanescence's second album ""The Open Door"" is another hit! Their music sounds a bit different to me than their first album, but it just shows that they've kept their uniqueness. My VERY favorites on the album are: ""Sweet Sacrifice"", ""Lacrymosa"", ""Like You"", and ""The Only One"". The slow songs on the album are: ""Lithium"", ""Like You"", and ""Good Enough"", all of which are very powerful, just as the ones on their first album had been. All of their songs have a cool, unique sound to them and you can not only hear the meaning behind the lyrics, you can feel it through their music. I definitely recommend this album as well as their first album, ""Fallen""!"
3,Different Music,"I had heard, and was impressed by a few Evanescence tracks before buying this album. It was not an immediate hit with me but after listening to it 10 times I'm getting in to it. I will be buying more of their music. Amy Lee has such an amazing voice."
5,Evanescence does it again,"after their smash hit 1st album Fallen... Evanescence returns with an even better, more fresh, yet familiar, sound/beat! The Open Door brings songs of hope, depair, regret, and love... I love this album!"
5,Dark and stunning,"Amy Lee's vocals are the stuff of soaring emotion. Sad, overpowering and soaring into ecstasy . . . almost operatic. ""Good Enough"" can bring you to tears. This is a wondrous album. Every song is excellent. Highly recommended. I loved ""Fallen"", but this album is so much more special."
5,The Open Door,"I'm a big Evanescence fan, so there was a lot of expectations for this new CD. The themes of the lyrics aren't as plain as in ""Fallen"", but I think that's what makes the CD unique. They've definitely deviated from what they were doing before and the reasons for their music. But, there is a little dark undertone in most all the songs, with the exception for the last track, ""Good Enough"". A really good buy for any fans (who should already have it!) and for those looking for some great music... and I mean the intrumental type. I love it!"
2,Wouldn't have bought a second album if this were their first,"Fallen was a very strong album--heck, I was hooked halfway through hearing the first single on the radio. And there were a couple strong songs since (Broken and Missing come to mind). On this one, Call Me When You're Sober and Lithium are strong but overall this album lacks the depth and spirit of Evanescence's first offering.I'm not sure if it's the lack of a male vocalist, or the loss of the influence on the songwriting that killed this album. I'd rather listen to Hungry Lucy, Within Temptation, or of course Fallen than this."
3,Poor Raging Soul,"I received this CD from a relative. I really couldn't believe the darkness in this album. Amy Lee's recent breakup come screaming through with raging anger and deep dark sorrow. I hope she has removed these from her system. Amy Lee has a very beautiful voice, and it is a shame that she is singing from the dark on most of the cuts. She does appear to be recuperating by albums end. The later tracks are not too bad. I still think the previous album was much better. I hope she continues to sing, but come to the lighter side dear girl, you certainly have the voice for it."
3,Growing Pains,Overall this is a very good cd. It has moments of brilliance and others where it flails around as if they have prog rock aspirations but missed the point. Regardless it demonstrates growth and a willingness to take risks.
4,Monochromatic Goth,"First, let me say that this is a very good album. So good, in fact, that it's easily better than 3/4 of the cookie-cutter rock that's out today. Amy Lee's haunting, ethereal voice punctuates the roaring guitars and thundering drums perfectly (""Snow White Queen"" and ""Cloud Nine"" are excellent examples) -- but she's also capable of putting together a much softer, more intimate cut like the exceptional ""Good Enough.""Having said that, however, there's a disturbing lack of variety when you listen to the album as a whole. Each cut is very good on its own, but they start to sound very similar to each other on a complete listen. Unlike ""Fallen"" with its tremendous peaks and valleys of unique sounds, this Evanescence album is the foothills that never quite reach the same heights or valleys of originality.Still, a very good album and a solid follow-up to something truly exceptional."
3,not a complete failure :),"I was not sure wether I would like the open door or not at first. I heard their single, call me when your sober, and my first thoughts were 'what the heckkkkk.' eventually, I began to like that song. but anyways, I got the album. the first 6 or so songs are good. then a few other songs here and there.there are some differences I noticed in the music.I think that the lyrics have REALLY improved. and her voice has as well. the music doesn't seem like the same thing over and over again like it had in the last album. I guess I could say that I like the music better.but there's still something missing.not a reason to call it a complete failure.because it's not even a failure.I am disappointed in mostly the last bit of the album. it's just too much slow music, and it sounds all the same. i can't pick out a beat. or anything really.but you should still get this album. borrow it, burn it, just do something.-Amanda"
3,Evanescence does it again !,"Our manic depression and innermost fears, sadnesses, disappointments & insecurities never sounded so cool (at least since the debut album, ""Fallen"")! I admit, I was skeptical that the 2nd studio album could come close to reaching the peaks & valleys of the 1st album, but I was very pleasantly surprised with the final result! ""Fallen"" set the bar so high that it's hard to imagine how the followup could ever match or surpass it. The keyboards and lyrics don't quite hit as close to home as ""Fallen's"" but the guitars and drums are rock solid!Hopefully, Amy Lee does not get tired of the format/style too soon. We wouldn't want her to start doing sunny-day pop-princess stuff, now would we? Way to go Amy & the group!"
2,Let Down,"When I first heard this album, I was disappointed. But this album has grown on me. I was disappointed because many of the lyrics seem very childish and stereotypically goth. I consider stereotypical goth lyrics to be very narrowminded, a ""it will never get better"" mentality, and your problems are everyone else's fault. On Fallen, many of the songs had a optimistic tone. There was a sense that she was going through a rough time, but that it will get better. This album seems to completely abandon that positive mentality.It is worth it to spend the money to buy this album, but don't expect anything billiant."
2,Triumph of Mediocrity,"I don't like it. I try hard to digest how this group sells a lot. The tone of her heavy filtered voice is unacceptable and the compositions are totally uninspired. The repetition of nothing.Some people think that this Evanescene thing is some special kind of music, when in real there are other groups out there far superior in this genre.Try Listening to ""The Gathering"" from Holland. You will love Anneke's haunting voice.If you have normal hearing abilities and some taste in music or even better some adequate musical education you will see what I mean.Give out your money to the best and not to the commercial super market forgetable nonsense that has been promoted by the companies."
2,What the?,"The tracks on this CD are so complicated and so intelligible that it requires a supercomputer just to analyze it. The Open Door simply does not make any sense. A CD is supposed to contain music. This CD is has no music on it. Maybe if we sent a radio signal of this CD to outer space we'd get a response from E.T. In the meantime, if you want to buy a music CD from Evanescence, get the Fallen CD."
2,I don't see how people like this radio drivel,"Bad..same as all the other radio, pre-made cookie dough rock. I don't know how people see the creativity in this..."
1,Atrocious,"This CD is just a horrible follow up to a band that had a great unique sound. Gone is the heaviness and darkness that surrounded their first CD. Instead, it has been replaced with over the top monotone singing by Lee. It worked in the first, but let's face it...the music is what makes her voice good...not the other way around. She belts out notes just fine, only there's no excitement or anything.Average singing...below average songwriting...nothing catchy."
5,Evanescence...back and better than ever!,"I have been an Evanescence fan ever since ""Fallen"" came out. Amy Lee is a beautiful and talented singer. At first, after hearing ""Call Me When Your Sober"", I thought the CD might be good, but was it worth buying? Well, it totally was and I listen to it like once a week! Great job, Evanescence!"
5,Another great cd!,If you enjoyed their first cd you will definitely like this one too. Great cd from beginning to end!
3,OK,"I still love Amy Lee's voice, and Call Me When You're Sober is a great song, but the rest sort of just blends together. Not as many ""hits"" as the first CD. You can definitely tell that she is glad to be out of her last relationship. It's important to read the lyrics to get a real feel for the mood of this CD. They are a great band and I'm ready for their next CD."
5,The Door is wide open by the end,"I must agree with the other reviews that comment on Evanescence's FIRST album, Origin; this is very much like that album. Origin is still by far the best Evanescence album....sadly it will never be available to the masses. If you want it, you're gonna have to DL it. Anyway on to ""The Open Door"" I got the bootleg about 3 weeks ago and listened to it off and on, stopping the album at track 7. After buying the album on release day, it's been playing non-stop. My personal favorite is 'Snow White Queen"". The album takes some time to build up, and this where the door swings wide open. Every song after track 6 is everything I'd want Amy to sound like. I'm not saying go on a DL'ing spree, but if you have not heard Origin, try to find it now as it's a perfect compliment to The Open Door."
4,A little old and a little new,"I didn't read all of the reviews yet, but I have to say I'm happy with ""The Open Door"". Being a long time Evanescence fan and actually owning almost all of the albums I am able to buy (for under $200 that is), and having access to some of their most early demos I give it my stamp of approval.It's not Fallen, but why should it be? So many fans complain of bands releasing the same old thing over and over again. This has a few of the usual themes, but for the most part it's fairly fresh. Call Me When You're Sober is a good song and makes a great single, a little different.I'm not sure what's up with the price right now but it's under $10 so grab it now!"
4,Solid Disk If You Give It A Chance,"To be perfectly honest, the first time I listened to this CD I wasn't all that impressed. There just seemed to be something missing. Something was different. But the more I listened to this disk, the more I came to like it.I'll admit, I was a little biased before I even took the wrapper off this CD. There was the whole ""Ben wasn't a part of this album"" thing in play coupled with a few pretty negative reviews on here, and the high expectations (Fallen set the bar pretty hight). Don't get me wrong, this disk is not quite as great as Fallen, but it more than holds it's own once you get into it.I knew I was hooked when I realized that I had several of the songs stuck in my head. So give this one a chance and come in with an open mind."
5,The Open Door,"Nothing less than the usual incredible music from Amy Lee and Evanescence. Even with the slight line up change, they still sound amazing."
5,Awesome CD,"I absolutely love this CD, It is one of those cds where there are lots of good songs on the cd rather than just one!"
3,Decent follow up but wanes with time,"I was a fan of Evanescence's first album and when I heard their single ""Call Me When You're Sober"" I had to purchase this one. Overall it is a competent piece of music. The first time through I was entranced, yet the more I listened to it the less of a hold it held on me. Overall, only tracks 2 and 7 really stand on their own. The rest of the album, without the supporting tracks to segue into and prop them up, fail as individual efforts. If ever there was an ensemble album where it is the whole rather than the individual parts which make it work this is it."
2,No. Just...no,"Why Ben, why? With Moody gone, well, Evanescence just isn't good. Fallen was an absolutely incredible, 5/5 album with it's melodic, beautiful, and haunting sounds. Amy Lee is an incredible vocalist, but she sounds the same through this whole CD, as does most of the music. Exceptions being Sweet Sacrifice (Possibly my favorite Evanescence chorus), and Call me When You're Sober. Those two songs are great, hence the 2/5. Without them this album would be a 1, or about .5 if it were possible here. It is not the same without Ben helping writing. For people expecting an album as good as or better than Fallen, well, I'm really sorry. Just go download Sweet Sacrifice and Call Me When You're Sober onto your ipod or MP3 player or whatever, just dont shell out the money to buy this whole CD. Just keep listening to Fallen and pray that Ben Moody comes back (though I doubt that will happen)."
2,Disappointing..,"My title for this review pretty much says it all. The Open Door was a disappointing showing for Evanescence. Fallen was one of my absolute favorite cds, and I was expecting nothing less from this one. The songs were average, and the ones that were good, seemed like they came right off of Fallen. Over all, its an ok listen, but I'd just rather listen to my old one..."
5,Can't get enough,Really can't get enough of this group. I am just counting the minutes to the next album. Every album tops the last one.
1,Huge Disappointment.,"Let me first say that I am an Evanescence fan. So it truly pains me to write this review.I can't believe this album took 3 years to make. I also cannot believe Evanescence actually wrote this album. All the songs are generic and bland. Listen, I have all the bootleg albums. I have their demo tracks. I know that even at their worst, they can do a billion times better than what we're presented with here. I get the distinct impression that this is nothing but a blob of corporate sputum branded with a name we love just to fulfil some inane contractual obligation. There is no soul. It is hollow. An abomination. I highly suggest you save your money. But, hey, if you like bland and generic, then you'll probably love this album."
3,major change from Fallen,"After listening to the previews, only one phrase enters my mind, ""Where's all the fast-paced rock songs that i am so used to hearing from them?""I actually think they sound a little like Muse with the long held high notes. I'm actually having second guessed to buying this. Sure Amy Lee's voice is beautiful and the lyrics are so pretty but the actual track is a little ...ehh."
3,"Good CD, except for the EQ","On the whole I actually like the songs better on this CD than on Fallen. Maybe because I haven't heard them all a bazillion times already, but this album offers a little more variety. It's still roughly the same sound, but better.The guitars on the first album always bugged me in their repetition and lack of range. This has been ""fixed"" a bit with the new fella. I'd still like to hear a little more than the predominant power chords.The strongest song is probably Good Enough, a piano ballad the ends the album. A couple other good tracks are Sweet Sacrifice, Lacrymosa, and Like You.A big gripe I have with this CD, something that caused me to drop it from 4 to 3, is the production. The music suffers from lack of dynamics due to poor production, in my mind. When the band kicks in everything is jammed up to the top together, making it sound like a big jumbled mess. This isn't all that uncommon anymore, but it's really annoying."
5,My Door is Open!!!,"OH MY SWEET LOVE!!! I love this album so much. I bought it (from Amazon) and I just got it this past Monday, and I must say that I'm already addicted to this album. I'm listening to it right now as we speak, and I love it!!! Especially ""Cloud Nine"". Evanescence caught my attention when I first heard ""Bring Me To Life"", and now they've still got me at hello!!!"
4,"Not quite Fallen, but still pretty great","This album was pretty great, but I liked Fallen a bit more. It's definitely worth what I spent for it."
2,Evanescence,Item received promptly. I have played the CD both on my home theatre system and in my automobile. The songs are great but poor recording quality.thank you for the opportunity to review the product.
1,worst,"this album is worst ever produced, and this album no where near better then the first.full of poor pitty me feelingif this best this artist produces then the best days are behind them"
1,Ha ha ha ha,Heavy? Dark? Rock? Sensual? Evanescence and Shakira are the same thing: pop and more romantic pop. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Please don't buy it arggghhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Boring predictable rock,"I've only heard the first single, but that is all I have to hear to no this album is going to suck. I heard the first album and I noticed something, every song sounds the exact same boring and whiny.The new song sounds pretty much like every song off their first album. This band is just a boring and generic rock band with a great singer.IF you want to here some real rock and roll, relive the glory days, then check out some of these bands: Rose Hill Drive, Silvertide, The White Stripes, The Black Keys,The Mars Volta, Wolfmother , those are real rock and roll bands."
1,HOW CAN IT BE THIS BAD!??!! READ FIRST!!!,"This album is lame, bland, and the production is horrible. First off this isn't Evanescence. It's a whole new band with Amy singing. This is like a David Lee Roth solo album after Van Halen. Or worse a Scott Stap solo album without Creed. Yeah it's that bad. Every single melody is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo stretched out. So boring. New guitar player was in Limp Bisket, that should tell you how much he sucks. The band blows, songs are horrible,and its' just a waste of money. Why else is it selling for $9 ? lol. THEY ARE DONE!"
2,Like the opera?,"Evanescence has become like listening to the opera. The piano can be used in rock music, but not in every song on the damn album. Her voice is all you hear in every song, along with her depressing piano. So if you enjoy the opera or classical music, buy this album. If you want something that rocks, try Hinder."
1,Please dont come back again never !,"This crap leaked 1 month before its release and it is worse than their first CD. Why do they keep going? all the songs sounds exactly the same, I really hope this band goes away soon forever along emo like green day, flyleaf and LP. Dont spent your money on this wait for the new deftones record and the new DVD on high definition of NIN in early 2007. Instead of this fat girl buy the way better Lacuna Coil or Arch Enemy."
2,im not 13....17 also....this cd,"yeah well.....back in the day i bought fallen and trust me...im not into this type of music....im into metal...not ""goth/glam rock"" but it actually satisfied my tastebuds at the time...well here we are and the new release is out...and unfourtunately i don't enjoy the new sound....now the single ""Call Me When You're Sober"" is a good song along with ""Lithium"" if you enjoed ""My Immortal"" but if you are looking for a METAL band with a good chick vocalist...check out Walls of Jericho.--Hail True Metal--"
2,Say goodbye to Evanescence.,"TOD is a pretty significant departure, musically, from ""Fallen."" She (and I say ""she"" because Amy Lee really is the band) tries to be more artsy and less ballsy but it just doesn't work. The result is musically dull melodrama with nothing to give it worth other than Amy's fabulous voice. Considering how good ""Fallen"" was and how long fans had to wait for the second release, this is a huge disappointment.I suspect the change in line-up has a lot to do with this; the real musician/songwriter obviously left the band. TOD is vaguely reminiscent of Tori Amos but not nearly as good. I suspect that this is the last we will ever hear from Evanesence. Hopefully, Amy Lee will do better with her next project."
5,A Masterpiece,"I'm a guy of 54, and yet I could cry all the way through this album.Awe-inspiring, heart-felt, poetic, light, dark, transcendent, majestic, beautiful. Along with ""Fallen"", probably the best thing to happen musically in decades."
2,Not what I was expecting,"I really loved 'Fallen', but this CD was a bit of a disappointment. The song writing was not as good as Fallen. I think it was nice to hear the orchestral instruments fused into the music, but the major thing I noted was that Amy Lee was dropping her voice lower than it was capable of going and it sounded horrible. On several occasions, she even attempted the range of an opera singer soprano and that did not sound too good either. The first album was flawless and Amy's vocals were right on target, but the fact that she pushed her vocal ability either higher or lower then what she is capable of ruined the album (for me anyway)."
3,"Good, but not as much as the previous.","There are at least a couple of good songs on this one, but the previous was better."
5,EVANESCENCE IS AWAZING,This album is one of the greatest albums ever made. Amys voice is haunting and just beatuifal. The haunting Lacrymosa is a AMAZING track her voice is perfect and gives you chills. There are a lot of good rock tracks her to such as weight of the world a awsome song to and the beatuifal ballad good enough. BUY this album at first you may not liek ti but after a while you will love it.
5,Another musical masterpiece,"Evanescence has delivered another compelling set of songs. I know the band has gone through some member changes and I was afraid that it would hurt the music. This album may even be better than the first one--if that is possible.Musically, this one is tight and theatrical in composition. I love the arrangements and on one song in particular--Weight of the World--It starts out with heavy guitars and Amy Lee's singing adds beautiful melodies to the song. Then in the middle of the song, the rest of the music drops out except for acoustic guitar and Amy Lee--so powerful. I love all of the songs on this c.d., which is rare for me. Lithium is another one that stands out to me with the piano in the beginning and then the rest of the band kicks in--really dramatic. Lyrically, the songs are deep and meaningful.Heavy music and enchanting vocals--it doesn't get any better than this."
3,O.K. cd,"There are a few tracks that are great, but unfortunately I find that I am skipping around songs to find the good ones. I was hoping for better."
3,decent sophomore effort,"A good buy, but with a few exceptions, lacks the musicality of the first record. Most of the tracks have the driving guitar, but not the beautiful melodies of Evanescence's first album. The one track that I feel matches the caliber of their first album is ""Call me when you're sober."" My suggestion is to listen to it first before you buy."
4,Great CD,"After I was disappointed by Anywhere But Home, this reaffirmed my faith in Evanescence. I give the CD 4 instead of 5 stars purely because many of the songs sound similar to one another, but they are great nonetheless."
5,Evanescence has never been so good!,"I was in Germany when I heard the song ""Call me when you're sober"" I won't lie to you, it took me time to adecuate my ear, then I saw the album in late september and bought it October the 2 in frankfurt. Besides the package of it, I could not believe the depht of the songs, Amy Lee really knows how to write and sing. The best songs are:Call me when you're sober - 5 stars - her sisters sing in the background!Weight of the world - 5 stars - play it when angryLithium - 5 stars - it's my itunes most played song! great video also!All that I'm living for - 4 stars - I like the acustic version betterGood enough - 5 stars - The most relaxing song ever (play it while in a slow bath)The other songs are good, but you'll be captured by the ones I just mentioned.Buy it!Silvio Tercero"
5,They've still got it!,"So much has been written already about this album, and many people have posted excellent, thorough reviews, so I'll be brief and to the point. If you like the work of Evanescence from their early demos to Fallen, you will be very pleased with this album. I thought they might 'mellow out' some, boy was I wrong. Just as ""Fallen"" grabbed me from the very first track, the same happened with ""The Open Door"". Powerful and consistent. A++ !!"
2,Very disappointing,"I was extremely disappointed by this album. It just didn't grab me at all like Fallen did. It has no outstanding tracks or anything much memorable. I guess Nightwish has spoiled me. Before, Evanescence was about the only female-fronted band I cared to listen to. Now that I have discovered Nightwish, Evanescence just seems useless. Sorry, but I just don't care for it."
2,I think this movie was a big bore,"this had to be without a doubt the worst chucky film since the first child's play came out. i love chucky, but this sequal should have been thrown out the window. i mean the characters are kind of dull and chucky's attempt at black humor is sick."
3,Chucky makes you laugh and scream on this one !,"If you analyze this movie as a third part, it still a very good movie. The deaths still very bloody, Chucky is very funny is this one ( More than in the second part ). The only thing i'm sorried for is than, now, the original cast is gone forever, now than a grown up Andy Barclay is played by Justin Whalin."
2,Here we go again.. Child's Play 3,"Here we go again somehow Chucky has survived another oopsy or several of them to be exact, It's a trip down memory lane and can be entertaining,more of a horror comedy than true horror, Should have left well alone at part 1."
3,okay movie but same old same old . nothing new!,"not really scary,but some effective special effects.1,2,and4 are a whole lot better!only for when you are really bored or a fan!"
1,The weakest in the series,Child's Play 3 is nothing new on the Chucky franchise. Andy is a litte older now so Chucky needs to find someone new to possess. Chucky still uses one-liners and the death scenes are ok but once again the script is lame as screenwriter Don Mancini was asked to begin writing the third film even before the second film was released. Justin Whalin makes a horrible Andy and it's no secret his career went nowhere.
3,not the best but...quite fun,Chucky is back in his new body and is still on the search for Andy Barclay (his only way to be human). You 'll be ready to join the army after seeing this film.
4,Chucky's best rampage!!!,"After finally seeing this film after trying to track it down for months, I was not disappointed. This is the best Chucky film, with Child's Play coming next, Bride of Chucky 3rd and the awful Child's Play 2 coming last. Unlike part 2, the story is spread out and not rushed through like part 2. Anyway, this one sees Chucky ressurected 8 years after his gruesome death in part 2. He goes to the milatary acadamy where Andy now stays to transfer his soul into Andy.But Chucky then decides to put his soul into Tyler, a young black cadet. This movie rocks! Buy it!"
2,This is the worst Chucky movie!,I have one really tough question to ask the writer of this film. What the hell happens to Kyle from part 2 and what the hell happens to Andy in The Bride of Chucky?
3,The Chuckster is back,"This Movie was ok , but it was not scary and was more funny than horror, but this movie was a chuckie movie so that means i liked it .Don't buy it if your not a chuckie fan. If you are a fan , i reccomend you to buy it"
3,NICE,"This movie is pretty good but is a little slow though the whole movie, I enjoyed it though. It is a good sequel, for the child's play series"
1,It's time Chucky gets laid to rest!!!,"The second sequel to an ok horror film,that could have done without any sequels.The third time around Andy is older and has been inrolled in a military school.At the same time a company decides to clean up the old factory that the Good Guy dolls were made in and start making them again.Blood from the old Chucky doll gets into the new mix and Chucky is resurrected as a doll once again.After he learns Andy's wherabouts he has himself sent to the military school,but a young boy Tyler opens the package and Chucky eventially tries to takeover his body.We've seen it all before,don't even bother with this!"
2,The worst ever........,"The Chucky doll lives on......again......he's back.......for the3Rd time....blah,blah,blah!.After the 1st to CP movies,it is tiresome and disapointing to watch this.It has the same BASIC idea:Chucky after andy's soul.The only twist:Chuckies blood has now infused into a new doll.But now,i'll get to the good and bads of the movie:GOODS:1.Good 'n'gory.2.A good dose of horror3.The Fair at the end is a rather good end setting,as the end in CP2 was a good setting._________________________BADS:1.Milatay Setting was a bad idea.2.Boring and predictable.3.Not as exiting due to lack of refurbishment to story.4.SF were way to terrible.5.Needs more ""jolts""in the early scenes.EXAMPLE:Killings,Gory ones.!6.Boring till the last 30-40 mins.Easily,this film is the worst in the series."
2,"WELL, THIS IS WHAT I DIDN'T WANT TO SEE","THIS TIME, CHUCKY GETS YET ANOTHER NEW BODY. HE QUICKLY GOES AFTER ANDY BARCLEY AGAIN, WHO IS BY THE WAY, 16 YEARS OLD AND IS A STUDENT AT A MILITARY SCHOOL. HOWEVER, A YOUNG BLACK KID IS TOLD BY CHUCKY THE SECRET OF HIS TRUE IDENTITITY AND NOW HE'S THE TARGET. DEFINITELY NOT AS ENTERTAINING AS THE FIRST TWO MOVIES. ONE THING THEY SHOULD'VE NEVER DONE WAS SHOW ANDY AS A TEENAGER. THEY SHOULD'VE KEPT SHOWING HIM AS A KID. HAD THEY DONE THAT ONE THING, THIS SEQUEL WOULD'VE TURNED OUT A LOT BETTER. ONE THING THAT WAS GOOD ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS ITS FINALE, WHICH TAKES PLACE IN A CARNIVAL. MUCH OF THE STUFF THAT LEADS UP TO THE FINALE IS MEDIOCRE. JUSTIN WHALIN JUST RUINED THE DIRECTION OF THE ANDY BARCLEY CHARACTER. THANK GOD FOR BRAD DOURIF. WITHOUT HIM, THIS SEQUEL WOULD'VE BEEN MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO WATCH. FOLLOWED BY BRIDE OF CHUCKY."
2,"""Chucky's Back!""... unfortunately!","Chucky (voice of Brad Dourif) is still looking for his old victim Andy Barclay (Justin Whalin) so that he can transfer his soul to a human being. ""Child's Play 2"" was an excellent and entertaining film from beginning to end, but its sequel, ""Child's Play 3"" is ridiculously bad and is the worst of the series. Credibility is slightly regained by the 'Chucky team' in ""Bride of Chucky"", but I think the producers should leave this alone for good."
1,The worst Chucky film ever made...,"Like i said, the worst Chucky film ever made...Here Andy is sixteen years old and enter in a military school, but, the Good Guy factory is re-open and the rest of Chucky from Child's Play 2 is used to a new line of Good Guys. The beginning is cool when Chucky kill that old guy, but the rest of the film, in the military school, it sucks ! Just talking like that..."
1,Who writes these movies?,"If you're over 14 you probably won't like this movie. I was really into it when it came out over a decade ago, but now it is completely unwatchable. It's nothing more than a silly puppet-show with ""wacky"" one-liners. It's so lame how they shake the little dolly to make him appear mad, when he's strangling someone. This movie takes place at a military academy and poor Andy is being pushed around by the big bad drill seargent, the big meanie! Oohhh... So dull."
5,CHUCKY'S BACK AND ARMED AND DANGEROUS!!,It has been eight years since the last confrontation between ANDY BARKLEY and his killer good guy doll CHUCKY.ANDY now age 16 is shipped to a hardcore military school called Kent.It seems ANDY has enough problems on his hands already with his tyrannical cornal bulling him but his troubles have just begun!Playpal toys has recreated the maniacal doll who finds his way to kent and plans on hunting ANDY down but finds some freh meat in the process!! With action horror and suspense this is anther succsesful and entertaining sequal in the series!!
2,It was not worth it,this movie cussed way to much. every scene involved about 10 cuss words. I dont see the point. chucky kills a few guys but there was no real plot. if you want a scary movie try childs play 2 not 3.
4,Brilliant! Chucky is at his best performance.,"This was the first ""childs play"" film I ever saw. Its clever how Chucky is ressurected as a ""good guy""doll for the nineties. The ending was rather bloody for Chucky but I am sure he wont give up so easy. Overall this movie is brilliant,Chucky is at his best performance since the first two films {although the first sequel is now banned in Britain.}"
2,Just when you thought that Good Guys were safe once again,"Eight years after the events of Child's Play 2, though that the makers of the Good Guy dolls, can't seem to help but to try to keep the factory going after what went on with one of their dolls. Just when Andy thinks that he can possibly get on with his life, Chucky eventually makes his way back to him in some way. Upon seeing that Chucky had found out where he is, what he don't know is that he had found someone `new' to play with and try to transfer his soul into a human body, and tries everything he can to help put a stop to him for good. That doesn't stop Chucky from unleashing some hell on the way and killing those who get in his way in any possible, though eventually this time it ends up that ends up being his downfall. Overall I give Child's Play 3, 2.5 stars out of 5."
2,yea it was weak,i just sat around watching the movie and it did bore me. the ending sucked when andy got arrested by the cops i wonder where he went. it was corny thats all i have to say.
5,Entrancing,"This is one of the most amazing Delerium singles ever. The first few seconds were enough to give me an impression, as it begins with a medieval Frensh style, with a mild beat and calm instrumental strings. Then of course, Leigh Nash comes in with her magical voice, giving the song a fairy-tale glow and adding a fine tune to the background piano and spanish guitar. The lyrics are overwhelming as with all delerium songs, not to mention the allocation of the chorus and the ending. The Remixes were amazing in their own way, and added a fine beat without ruining the essence of the songs. Buy this without a second thought."
4,Enchanting Ambience,"Delerium's Innocente are remixes by Lost Witness (Simon Paul & Simon Kemper), Deep Dish (Dubfire & Sharam), DJ Tito and MR SAM. All instrumentals are accompanied by the vocals of Leigh Nash from 'Sixpence None the Richer.' Nash's voice is rich and vibrant that echo with timbre tones in a hypnotizing, ambient landscape. The genius in the sound mixing with the use of piano, electronic keyboards, guitar and percussion. The original version appears on Delerium's POEM album.If you are a first time listener of ambient and trance music I'm sure you will be a Delerium fan with their intelligent colaboration of mixing guest vocals like Sarah McLachlan on their 'Semantic Spaces' album. I recommend this as a leap into the genre without being to overpowered. As it's spiritual Gregorian chants will mesmerize you. The same transition over to this album with new mixes and format along with the vocal talents of Nash. If you like listening to Enigma and Mythos then you'll like Delerium."
1,RIPOFF!,"Being that im joining the Corps in a month, I figured that I would absorb as much information via dvd and books as I could. Let me tell you this movie STINKS. About 5 minutes into the film I realized this is just bits and pieces of the History Channel's special on Parris Island (I forgot the name of the series but its a 3 hour 3 part deal). If you want to save yourself some money just tune to Military or History Channel and see all 3 hours (Ive watched the complete series at least 3 times in the last month on the Military Channel)."
3,Almost real....almost.,"This movie accuarately depicts what boot camp is really like. Except for one thing, the crucible. Due to the release date of this video, it was released and made before the crucible began. However, the crucible which is the last 54 hours of events at boot camp is now part of it. Other than not having the crucible, this is a pretty good movie."
4,Kid Friendly?,"My girlfriends brother was recently shipped off to boot camp in California. Her 6 year old son has been missing him and is always asking questions about what his Uncle is doing, having never been in boot camp before, I am unable to explain to him exactly what it entails. I am trying to find a documentary on Marine Boot Camp that is on the 'tame' side. I want the little guy to see what his uncle is doing, but on the other hand, I do not want to scare the crap out of him. Is this DVD what I am looking for, or should I continue my search? (Please excuse my rating, I have not watched this yet.)"
3,General Intro to Hinduism,"Mahadevan is an excellent person. A professor of philosophy in Madras and a vedantin. He also had a brother, who was a swami in the ramakrishna-vivekananda math. The book is a rather simple minded but a broad covering introduction into Hinduism. Unfortunately the print of this edition is unsatisfying. The chapters are as follows: 1.) The concept of religion, 2.) What is Hinduism, 3.) The scriptures, 4.) The rituals, 5.) Ethics, 6.) Spritual disciplines, 7.) The philosophies, 8.) The cults and 9.) Linving Hinduism. According to Mahadevas preface, the book ""was specially written for the purpose of introducing Hinduism to college students."", but for a further edition it has been expanded ""to be hoped that the present handbook will serve as a useful guide to all those who wish to understand Hinduism."" There are no pictures, except the one of Mahadevan. I'd say, it's an intro for a newcomer with an educated background."
1,had very little success with this item,"Just bought a new laptop with no serial port, and wanted to still use my Magellan Meridian Marine to upload waypoints and also for auto navigation. Bought this adapter, and installed the device. XP told me the driver was not XP certified. Sure enough, it cause one crash after another. The only way I could get it to run was to connect the USB adapter before booting the laptop, then boot, then connect the gps, and only then it would give location info only to Delorme Streets. If I plugged the usb with gps running in while the laptop was running, it crashed the operating system or tried to reload the driver. Never could get it to download or upload waypoints with Delorme applications (Streets and Topo), so it was useless to me and I returned it. I spent an hour on the phone with Magellan tech help, who claimed they had never had this problem before, but I never could get it to work properly."
3,great art...reading it not as fun,"Seraphic feather is a futuristic story that takes place in the moon, i quite don't understand whats the role of each character yet, but they all gather in the moon after some tragedy ocurred, each character looking for a mysterious item called the emblem seed.The story in itself is not as interesting and the way is told is very complex...it has a lot of flashback that instead of adding to the mystery of the characters just confuses you...but who cares? hiroyuke utatane is one of the best manga artists i've seen...his style is unique the moment you see the interior art it will grip you...the sexyness of the characters (both male and female) and the action scenes are worth taking a look"
4,solid stuff,"i didnt know what to expect,when i first listened to this cd...so i was not let down in any way.a solid release that will grow on you...all the time"
5,The background of the US Life Saving Service and United States Coast Guard,A wonderful addition to any historian's or researcher's library interested in the area of the Life Saving Service....later to be known as the United States Coast Guard.
5,"Fun, fun, fun","Remember the time, remember the movie! I knew what I was getting, already had the album on vinyl, and am happy to have it on CD now. My grandchildren love it, and want to know all about ""the olden days"" the singing, dancing and kids. With 41 songs well worth the purchase price. May just have to buy a copy of the movie!"
4,'Soundtrack of my Life',"This is the 'Soundtrack of my Life'! Many years ago I had it on cassette, then on CD's but on CD it came with 2 discs so you had to switch them. My 'new' Caddy has a cassette player so I was thrilled to score a good condition 'American Graffiti' cassette from Amazon as my old one had been lost to time. The cassette holds all 41 of the songs plus the 'Wolfman Jack' sound bytes from the movie."
3,It's just ok ...,"Purchased this to play at my 50th high school class reunion. It was okay but I was put off by the Wolfman inserts. It would have been great if it were only the MUSIC from the movie, not the 'man'. Don't get me wrong I love the movie and I loved the 'man' but I didn't want him on this particular CD."
2,Stupid voice overs!!!,"This would have been a top notch set of CDs if they hadn't put stupid voice overs on some of the best music tracks! Those stupid ""Wolfman Jack's"" voice on top of some of the best music reduces this from a five star to a two star rating!!!!! Other than that, the set is fine."
2,NOT the movie soundtrack,"Don't be fooled! This is not the motion picture soundtrack album. It is, true to its name, a presentation of all of the songs used in the movie and in the order of their appearance. Anyone who has heard the original soundtrack however will quickly realize that this album is missing the pacing and transitions between songs that help you relive the movie as you hear the music. If you really just want all the songs from the movie, then get this album. The collection is fantastic and provides a great compilation of hits from the era. If you are familiar with the soundtrack then you will shudder every time the CD transitions abruptly from one song to the next as if being played on a iPod. A sign of the times I guess!"
4,"Good music, shame about the mixing","Excellent music all through - just a shame that the 'wolfman' (radio announcer from the movie) is talking over the start and finish of a few of the songs, so you dont get the full 'real' track. The announcer should have been in seperate tracks, so that it didn't affect the actual song tracks.Luckily there's only 2 or 3 songs like this."
5,my time,this is from my generationhad this on vinylthis was uploaded to my iTunes & then to my touchlove the songs
5,50's remembered!,GREAT FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH - great soundtrack. Brought back fond memories of another time
5,American Graffiti,"It is everything I'd hoped it would be. I have played at work and in 3 different vehicles. As Bob Seger said, I love that ""Old Time Rock and Roll. That kind of music just thrills my soul."
5,THIS CD TOTALLY ROCKS!,"This is by far the best soundtrack to a movie in the world (according to me). First I saw the movie, then someone talked me into buying the soundtrack, I'm not a big fan of movie soundtracks, but AMERICAN GRAFFITI is a classic american soundtrack that proves it's time. I'm only 13 years old, and I've told some of my friends about this soundtrack, but they didn't sound very excited. I never was interested in oldies music until I purchased the CD last year, and I instantly fell in love with it. If you get the chance, see the movie, and if you like the music on it, purchase the CD, it will soon become an instant classic to you. TRUST ME!"
3,Unfulfilled,"This Pelican Brief wannabe has a lot of things going for it: a likable main character and a plot that grabs you from the start. However, Shelby compromises believability by using character lapses to move the plot forward. For instance, the assasin goes from slick to sloppy to explain Holland's life being spared. This book also leaves many loose ends dangling as a mystery from 15 years ago is often alluded to but never fully explained. Finally the ending seems way to contrived (just had to get the oval office in there somehow!) that makes for a rather hollow ending"
3,"Not bad, but very inconsistent","There was a good book here somewhere, but it was hidden behind too many inconsistencies in the plot, in the characters actions, and in implausible events. Many times you find yourself wondering how, or why something happened because when you think back to other events it just makes no sense. And some of the events are very implausible as well. The murders at the start of the book are a good example of this if you really think about it.On top of this, the writing isn't particularally good either. He jumps around with multiple viewpoints in almost every scene for starters. And many sections are not really clear either, you end up reading over parts twice to figure out what is happening. Still, the book isn't that bad. It is definitely readable if you like this kind of thriller, but there are a lot of better options. It will probably make a good movie someday."
1,HAHA,"Ive only heard a few songs on this album and i will already give it a single star. This album is repetitious and boring. This isnt FATA, this is a god awful wannabe band.What happened to the band that recorded TBYB? They died and no remnants of this once great band remain."
1,"Honey, Can you get me some Tylenol","Well, I didn't like anything they did in the past, so i question why i bought this album. Im not gonna bash they're attempt to please, because I know I could never make music, but its unbelieveable how terrible this buy is. Don't hurt yourself, at least dont give youself a headache."
4,Just listen...,"What is wrong with this cd? I have ""The Fiction we Live"" and the albums are very similar. I like this and the new A7X album as well. And while A7X are one of my favorite bands, From Autumn to Ashes are not. But i like this album. Give it a listen. It has decent songs, decent lyrics and decent instrumentals. Good vocals by the drummer too. I like the album, hope you do too."
3,Not as good as fiction we live,Itz an okay album but not as good as there last one. Dont know what happened.
3,this is not from autumn to ashes!!!,"(im not 13 i just dont wanna sign in) this album is not so bad if they were not from autumn to ashes but they play totally diferent then when they started, there first album was incredible, next album was ok but the last one made me wanna kick somebodys @ss because it was so comercialized and emo, i gave them 3 stars because i felt bad about giving them less, since they USED TO BE one of my favorite bands (fata please just give up your musical carrer)"
2,WTF,"ok first of all i like A7X new stuff. yes the voice take some time to ajust to but i think the guitar is more creative than the previous albums.ok now this band has gone downhill. the band lost a guitar and bass player and gone from: too bad... lots scream little sing, the fiction... some scream some sing, to lots ""sing"" tiny scream. PLEASE DONT MAKE ANOTHER ALBUM I DONT WANT TO BE HURT AGAIN!!"
3,YEP,First off avenged sevenfold had two amazing albums that destroy anything this band has ever put out before they came out with city of evil and sold out to the mainstream...but in either direction FATA is a ok band and this is a ok cd so go check it out if your into that sort of thing.... or look at a real band like the agony scene if u want good hardcore.
3,*Shakes Head,"all of these bands need to just change their band names once they release their second redords because they no longer are what they were in the rookie efforts. honestly if u want to change ur sound fine, but u should change ur name too because those expecting to hear ur old sound are very dissappointed like everyone here has pretty much said this is a mix of hevy and soft songs. dont get me wrong i do like it but i doubt ill ever waste my money on a bands second or 3rd efforts because time and time again im dissappointed. be smart DOWNLOAD THIS! dont waste ur money"
2,Sad...,"Change is not always good. Some bands change for the better, others for the worse. I think FATA has taken a huge step backward with this one, and not because it's different. I love all their earlier work, fast and slow songs alike... except when that awful girl sings. Anyway, this album seems to be an attempt to blend their earlier styles, and it comes out flat and simply boring IMO.I suggest you all preview this album before buying it. There are 2-3 songs that I think all prior fans will enjoy. The rest is something else, like it or hate it."
2,Oh man...,"I have been waiting for two long years for FATA's new CD to come out, but now that I've heard this I wish I was still waiting. Unless there is some good music in the parts that amazon doesn't play that I haven't heard, this is terrible. I'm sure I speak for most of FATA fans when I say this album is a great disappointment.~ Note to FATA: Stay away from pop-rock. It just sucks."
3,Abandon Your Genre,"This is not the From Autumn To Ashes we all know and love. Their sound has completely changed, completely. Do not be fooled by their first single ""Where To Draw The Line."" That is not what the album sounds like. The entire album is much softer, much. Only 5 of the 12 songs have the lead singer on it. I guess he's not really the lead singer anymore. The entire album sounds as if you're listening to ""Chlorofrom Perfume"" on repeat.The album isn't entirely bad. The songs that sound like From Autumn To Ashes are pretty good and the soft songs are good also. However, this album is not From Autumn To Ashes. If you are expecting ""Too Bad You're Beautiful"" turn away now. If you're looking for a faux-emo sounding band, you're in the right place."
2,Abandon your Fans!....... the true title,"Ok, to say that i was expecting another TBYB is crazy. I had little expectation, and even that is an overstatment, for this album, and it failed to even satisfy that. The album starts off pretty good with ""where do you draw the line."" A song that combines the agressiveness and melodic aspects that FATA has been trying to pull off. But then the very next song is a emo/pop rock song. Then it jumps into a hard metalcore song. I mean if you only listen to odd # songs the CD isnt bad. But through out the entire disc, it jumps back and forth everyother song. I mean i feel like i'm listing to CDs here. I mean the emo crap is just about as bad as Eighteen Visions ""Obessesion"". For a bad that put out a amazing album in TBYB, and a pretty good album TFWL. They threw everything away and completly lost there minds. And i think i know why they called the album ""Abandon your Friends"" becuase thats what theyve done to us, and this CD is going into the local used bin."
3,"Good, but there is better.....","I used this product for about 6 months and liked it. It really does help you recover from a hard workout and helps eliminate sore muscles the next day. But, I recently switched to ""Purple Wraath"" from Creative Labs and it is even better....."
4,Solid Alley-Cat Metal for the Money!!,"Solid, ""Alley-Cat Metal"" at a great price! Plenty of rockers here for the ""sunset-strip"" sound lovers! Song #1, 'Someone Like You' gets it going hard & fast with a great guitar riff! The Bonus tracks include help from a few people you may know: George Lynch ( Dokken, Lynch Mob ), Tracii Guns ( L.A. Guns ), Gilby Clarke ( Guns-n-Roses ), and Randy Castillo ( Ozzy, Motley Crue ). Nice addition to any collection!!!"
1,Not as advertised,This was advertised as 0 gauge and it turned out to be HO gauge. It was a Christmas present so there was no time to return but it certainly doesn't fit the train set it was bought to be a part of.
2,Keep shopping,"I have owned this blanket for less than a month so I cannot make any judgment about its longterm durability, but the first (and only) time it was washed it shed like a buffalo in springtime, and the dye used on the ""moss"" green was not colorfast in warm water and detergent. I gave it two stars because it is reasonably warm, and has an attractive weave."
2,wished I`de read the other reviews,I wished I had read the other reviews before purchasing. The blanket is warm but has pilled our brand new sheets badly. I have just washed it and it is NOT colorfast. Next time I will read before buying.
2,Pretty But Not Cuddly,"Taking it out of the package, I could see that it was loosely woven and feel that it was very rough. Then I noticed the thick threads were coming loose. With washing, it does seem to have softened a tiny bit, and shrunk so that it seems more tightly woven. However, I don't see myself actually using this blanket as anything but an extra blanket for really cold days. That way, maybe it will last longer."
3,Blanket,"Nice blanket, could have been softer but still nice, perfect on my couch and to wrap myself in it"
3,Lots of extras I didn't need,"After lots of searching I bought the Delta kit thinking I would get just about all I needed to set up my new dust collection system. Well bottom line there are connections that you just don't need like the 90 degree bends, and not enough of the connections you do need; like Y fittings. I was a bit too discouraged to do the math to see if I would have come out ahead just buying the exact fittings piece by piece at my local woodworking store. If I had to do it again I would probably do that."
3,Head is not cast iron,"I ordered the Delta 14-651 during the special promotion. Even though the shipping box was okay, the head was cracked. The head does not attract a magnet, so it is not iron. It looks and feels to be cast aluminum, maybe magnesium. Amazon told me to send it back for a refund, they are all out. Not sure if I will return it or take it to a Delta repair center. To bad. Besides the head, the rest of the machine looks to be cast iron. After all this time, I am suprised Delta has never fixed the problem."
3,Delta has no service,"I bought this tool years ago. It arrived with a significant ding in the belt cover. I wrote Delta for support and absolutely no response. Further, I followed up a few weeks later with a certified letter and still no response. Nothing much I could do about it when their service turns a deaf ear to their customers. The machine works ok but the fence is terrible.The only thing I can do is what I did. I absolutely refuse to buy another Delta product. I wouldn't care if their model was 90% cheaper than others. You don't treat customers with arrogant disregard and expect a loyal following."
1,cracked on arrival,"Purchased DELTA 14-651 Professional 1/2 hp Bench Mortising Machine and it arrived cracked. Had it returned, and ordered a replacement and it arrived completely broken. We don't know if it is the choice of materials or inadequate packaging, but ended up just returning it for a refund."
3,Delta Mortising Tool,"After having read all the negative reviews about this tool I was hesitant to order it. However after looking at a Jet JBM-5 at a local store and thinking it was rather cheaply built at a higher price, I ordered the Delta machine. It arrived in good condition and works great. The hold down is cast metal, not plastic like some reviewers complained about. This is a heavy solid machine.DKT"
2,No parts until Oct 2009?,"My local tool dealer told me how great this Mortising Machine was. How in the hell would he know? Ok, I've used it for a few years with no problems. Last month I was drilling holes and the coupler broke. Cheep cast iron. Ok, just order a part. Now I understand The part is on back order until October. I'll be out of operation for 5 months. Doesn't that seem unreasonable to you? My only option is to buy another machine, (not Delta) wait for the part then sell the Delta.By the way, I did get a coupler, but not from Delta. I got it from Grizzly. There mortising machine is the same as Deltas. Same maker, cheaper parts. At least they had the part."
5,Profesional Tool for the GREAT PRICE,Delta is one of my favorite brands and The 14-651 is certianly no exception to that. It was easy to put together from the box and pretty much squared it's self. It sank into the wood and completed the job in no time. Things to remember: I would have a good sharp hand chisle on hand to cleanup the mortises and make sure to run a Mortise and Tenon on some scrap before you comit on you project wood. This one tool that will certianly not disapoint whether you do it professionally or as a hobby.
3,Worst Delivery Ever Experienced,"I think this is a good product. I ordered it 3 weeks ago and still have not received it. Do yourself a favor and go to your local wood shop supply store and buy it. So far, I've taken 4 days off work to wait for its delivery so its costing much more than the advertised price"
2,Not very durable,Bought this machine a year ago. I have done two small projects and the piston that keeps the head up has been nothing but problems.I won't invest anymore time or energy into this. I now use a bungee to retract the pull down lever.
3,Some Quality Issues,"Just purchased the Delta 14-651 mortiser from Amazon. Shipping was exceptionally quick, however the packing material was in bad shape when I opened the box. Once degreased and assembled I found that the head would not travel smoothly along the column - it would jamb in some areas and move easily in others. After some investigation I found out that the rack (the long straight gear on the column) was very poorly machined. After about an hour and a half of work with a mill file I was able to even out the teeth and widen/deepen the notches on the rack. The mortiser now moves smoothly on the column.I'm happy with the mortiser now that the movement has been ""fixed"", but beware of poor quality in the rack and gear system."
4,Delta 14-651 Bench Mortising Machine,This machine is well built and easy to use. Set up is simple. Good product for the money.Shipping packaging is poor. The amount of cushion/foam around the mortising machine head in the shipping box is inadequate for the weight. The first two units arrived damaged in the same way. The mortising machine casting was broken where it slides on the column. The third one arrived unscathed except for a plastic lever arm used to secure the fence.
2,Bench Mortising Machine,"I have had my Delta Mortiser for about three years and I am sorry that I bought it almost from day one. The on/off switch went bad then the handle broke at the hub assembly and the quarter inch bits snap almost imediately. Delta wants fifty two dollars for replacement the quarter inch bits each. They will not sell just the bit itself, you have to buy the chisel too. Ever since Black and Decker bought Delta their quality and ethics have turn me completely off. Buy beware."
2,Quality Issues,"I've had this Delta mortiser for three years, but it is not heavily used. It's been babied, actually, and it's basically worked fine. A lot of difficulties have been mentioned... the fence adjustment doesn't work after installing the riser; poor quality castings, especially in the sloppy fence; and today, it ""died"" due to what I came to understand was the on-off switch failure. I've tried many different manufacturer's tools (Dewalt, Bosch, Grizzly, Porter Cable, Makita.... This will be the last Delta tool I buy."
2,I don't think the fence should break!,"The fence on my Delta mortise machine broke after abouttwo years of use. Yes, the *fence* broke! It broke whilewithdrawing the chisel from a hole. I called Delta andwas told that they no longer make that replacement part.So, my broken fence will cost me about $300, but Deltawon't be getting it. Caveat Emptor."
2,Finally a good one after 3 tries,"I rated it 2 stars because of the quality contorl from the factory. I had to return two damaged machines to finally get a good one. After the second unit that had a cracked casted yoke assembly, Amazon removed thwe item from their site and had the vendor investigate the problem. The problem was not with the shipper. The package was not damaged. It had to packed up already damaged.I have to compliment Amazon for working this out and being very responsive. I finally got an undamaged mortiser yesterday and after the short assemby and a single test it does perform as expected.The actual mortiser is very well made and is easy to use."
3,Included riser block disables functionality,"This is probably the best mortister I've ever had, but the included riser block disables and negates the functionality of the micro adjusting fence, etc. Quite irritating if you ask me but I got around it by having another mortiser attached to my floor drillpress when I'm mortising and I can do the larger stuff there. The box is wimpy and will be beat up when it arrives, just be aware of that and check for damage when you open it. It took me 10+ weeks to get mine!"
3,delta mortiser,Seems to be functional. A piece was broken out of the base but if you intend on buying a powermatic 66 forget about it. I ordered one feb 07 and still today aug 13 still haven't got it. excuses after excuses.
1,Very poor quality,"When this machine went on sale for $145 shipped, I decided to ignore some of the bad reviews and took a chance. Amazon got it to me within 2 working days without any external signs of damage. When I unpacked it, I saw that the metal casting around the motor assembly had broken into 2 pieces. I thought about getting a replacement, but when I inspected the edge of the metal which had broken off, I found that the metal used for the casting is of incredibly poor quality. It looked very brittle. There is no way this machine can stand up to even moderate use. I'm getting a refund and will pick up a Jet or something else.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
3,Another Broken in Shipping,"I know some people think one should rate the machine and not the shipping, but, if over 30% of the people that order this tool receive a broken one do to shipping, I think it is safe to assume that in the total manufacturing process of this tool inclusive of Packaging, this tool is failing the final step. So, I give it a three. This is with the assumption that I would love the tool if it wasn't broke.At least after reading many of the reviews, the first thing I did was examine the machine well prior to removing it from the box. I noticed the crack before I ever took it out.If you order this machine, be prepared to receive a broken unit. The price and free freight may be enough to give it a shot. It was for me. Hope the next one is not broke."
1,3 orders/3 broken tools,"I have a terrible experience ordering the mortising machine. The first order arrived with the housing unit cracked. I was resent a 2nd machine and that was also cracked in the housing unit. Figuring 3 times is a charm, I anxiously awaited delivery of the 3rd attempt to send me the Mortising Machine. I was NOT rewarded - the third shipment had pieces of cracked housig and was worse then the prior 2 shipments. I returned the product AGAIN and said thanx but no thanx I don't want to try for a fourth time. No effort was made by Amazon to say sorry or obtain a completely whole Mortising machine. Very disappointed."
5,Delta 14-651 Pro Bench Top Mortising Machine,Machine arrived on time and in good condition. Have used it several times and has performed as expected.
5,Built Like A Tank,"Well, I had to wait two weeks for the machine to finally ship (in spite of the ""ships in 24 hours"" assertation from Amazon), but it finally arrived. The box was broken on the corner, so I was afraid that I too would suffer the shipping disaster that has plagued too many who have purchased this machine. I guess I'm lucky, because the mortiser had no damage.Set up took less than 30 minutes, and it cuts nice, clean, straight mortises. A little tweaking to get it fine tuned, and it's ready to go. Easy to use, good manual, and heavy duty (by modern standards) construction. Overall, it's a great buy for the $200 price. Best machine for the money I've seen, especially after looking at the Shop Fox and others with wooden bases.If you have the patience to wait out the long shipping times, the guts to take a chance on it not being destroyed, and the need for a good mortiser at a great price, buy this thing. It will make a great addition to your shop."
1,Professional?....Not even close,"This is an example where pretty good engineering is erased by lousy quality control. The machine work is extremely rough and the table and fence took hours of grinding and filing to get them half way smooth. Once the parts are smooth enough to be assembled, you realize that the fence isn't square to the table. That takes more grinding and filing to correct. Now you get to actually use the machine - only to find that the chisel and bit don't line up with each other and neither is square to the fence. Shimming the column square to the table and then shimming the motor to get the chisel and bit in alignment finally yield a useable machine.This wouldn't be a bad machine if there was some quality control in the machining and assembly processes but unfortunately there isn't. My mortiser finally works OK but I really wish I'd bought a General or Powermatic."
4,Delta Mortiser,I just finished building a cabinet requiring the use of several mortise and tenon joints. THe Delta Mortising Machine worked great. The only flaw I found was the hold down was difficult to tighten accurately. Tightening the set screw always seemed to increase the pressure on the workpiece. Getting the right amount of pressure always required several tries.
1,Waited and waited...only to get a broken tool,"Like others who have posted here, I received a broken mortiser in the mail. It did not appear that the box was damaged, so I thought all was well. However, upon opening the box, I saw that the casting had snapped in one location. Judging by the material exposed by the crack, the casting looked as if it was of poor quality. I returned it for a refund and will be looking around locally for one that I can be sure is in good shape when I take it home. Don't be fooled...this is a common and serious issue. No one likes to waste time shipping broken tools back and forth."
1,Yet another damaged shipment,I ordered this item dispite the previous reviews about damaged shipments thinking that they were the minority and I would get lucky. Well...the machine arrived in a box that was in great shape and I was optimistic until I opened it. The housing was cracked at the dovetail joint just as described in the other reviews. It is either a defect in the manufacture or the method of packing by the manufacturer. I don't feel that Amazon or UPS was at fault for this. I returned it for a refund.Do yourself a favor. Find a reputable retail store that sells the mortiser either assembled or in a box that you can check immediately. It would be worth the extra $30 you save from Amazon by avoiding the hassle of shipment and returns.
4,shipments cause concerns,this is an excellent piece of equipment if it is delivered without damage. from the reviews I read it appears that all thedamaged units were purchased from amazon.com. why? should I buya second unit for my son from a local merchent?
1,Frustrated,"Avoid this tool at all cost. I purchased one 2 months ago, uncrated and set it up yesterday and used it for the first time today. On the fourth mortise cut, the handle flopped freely and the head stopped in position. Unable to raise or lower the head with the handle, I removed the head from the stand. Upon examination of the gear mechanism I discovered that the pin that holds the gear to the handle had sheared off. I had not really stressed the machine at all so the failure was inexplicable. I've never been a fan of Delta tools and this experience proved my worst fears. Buyer beware."
1,Cracked on arrival,As with others here it was cracked on arrival. in the same place where the motor part meets the column. Bad castings. overseas cheap labor! I returned it with no problems for a refund. The powermatic looks like a better machine.
1,Don't buy this tool,I am a Delta tool guy with a Unisaw and 3 HP shaper to name a couple of things. These tools are great. Made well and dependable. This Mortising Machine however is a POS. After a couple of years the Pot metal used for the twist clamps breaks into pieces in your hands like a graham cracker. I have had to replace these twist claps with bolts from the hardware store just to keep working. The machine is underpowered at 1/2 hp and stops easily clogging on wood chips. The lever is too short and needs to be a little longer like the other bench top models like the Shopfox or Powermatic.
2,Delta 14-651 Royal Pain,Use this machine at your own risk. You will have to regrind the fence to get is square and don't believe for a second that the center line of the motor is automatically perpendicular to the bed/table. Nothing but grief. I'm looking to replace my two-year-old Delta with something else.
1,Emerson,"I purchased this item on February 20th, 2005 and it reached me today 15th March, broken in two. It seems as though it shifted while being shipped and the machine broke away from the base. I am very disappointed at this time,but the shippers promise to compensate me for the damages. From what I saw, I believe that the packaging was not properly labelled and therefore it may have been placed in the container for shipping upside down, which meant that the heavy base was in the air rather than flat on the ground. Nevertheless I will order a replacement since I need to have it."
4,Delta 14-651 Mortising Machine,Good machine for hobby woodworking. Easy set-up and instructions. Only wish is sharpening stones be included with the chisels.
3,Another warning on shipping damage,"I read the warnings about shipping damage and decided to take my chances. Well the FedEx 2 day delivery was enough time to allow the shipping process to take its toll. I received the mortiser with the motor support broken off from the rest of the body. I don't know if I have the heart to keep trying since it takes so long to order, ship back, reorder ad infinitum."
2,Lever binds half way down,"Upon reading all the reviews on this both good and bad, it is a mediocre product. I picked mine up from a woodworking store 5 or 6 years ago and had no issues with packaging and assembling per everyone elses problems. My issues were the lever would bind half way down while trying to drill through and once I started drilling it was rather tough going. After many mortises the piece where the lever connected to the motor broke into pieces and it did take quite a while to get a replacement. I do agree that the hp is not quite enough for drilling through hard woods like maple or oak. Many mortises have been made since my purchase but I just deal with with the binding...you get what you pay for I guess."
1,disappointed in delta,Box was just like new. Opened box casting on main housing broken. Therewas no sign of rough delivery. Delta has gone down hill on tools. Returned and got refund no more delta tools for me. AMAZON was great.
2,WoodWorkers Beware!,"I learned a lot from this mortising machine. Like, how to uninstall the chisel and bit to remove the wood chips jammed in them. Of course, removing the chisel and bit ruins all your squaring efforts and you have to square everything again. And I learned to put a gorilla twist on the chuck in order to keep the bit from falling out of the chuck whilst you mortise away. I learned how to swing on a handle in order to get enough force to cut into the wood (Oh, yes, the chisels are honed and very sharp). I learned to cut my fingers when changing out the chisels or having to bang on the top of the drill auger bit to get it out of the chisel when it jams with wood chips, or more often wood CHIP.I don't have any problem with the actual quality of this albatross. It is heavy, roughly finished, and everything squares...again and again. But I now use a router or more often a drill press and a hand chisel."
1,AVOID THIS ITEM AT ALL COST!,"As with so many other people that have purchased this item, it arrived broken. Mine was broken in the same place as the customer photo shows, a major cast iron section. They either aren't packaging these correctly for shipping or sending them back out after they've been returned as damaged. In either case, you don't save enough money buying it from Amazon to make it worth the extra headache and time of returning it, especially since it is so heavy (80 lbs). You're better off just buying one locally if you can.UPDATE: I received a replacement. Amazon makes the process pretty painless. Unfortunately, the replacement was broken as well. I got my money back."
2,"great tool, bad shipping",I recently ordered a grizzly band saw and I was so happy i went back to this company. when I recieved this tool from the mail it looked a little lerry to me. after opening it I found that the moter was cracked in half! I was very desipionted but they are sending me a new tool very soon. I'v heard this tool is great but I havent tried it yet:(
4,Good tape,"Great for the beginner. Takes some time to learn the steps, but it's fun! Typical Richard Simmons style."
3,Too much shrieking!,"There's so much piped in hootin' and WOO-in', you can barely hear Richard's cues. A fun, low-impact workout, but what a racket!"
4,Gift purchase,"This was purchased as a gift, but once the music starts, I can't help joining the fun. I'm exercising, but not really."
5,oldies,This is my all-time favorite and I have all of his tapes. I sure wish it was available on DVD; hopefully it will be just like the others.
1,EXERCISE but A BIT OVER THE TOP!!!!!,"however u get a workout he does make me feel uncomfertible. teh ""larger"" people really made me feel liek i was never gonna loose my 5 pounds. THe singing was jsut to much. i didn't feel comfertible at all!!!!!!!!"
4,Different but still cool........,"I'll start by saying that Voice of a Generation is one of the best punk albums of all time. This came a little while later and is totally different. It's more goth punk like Southern Death Cult or Theatre of Hate. This is also heavily influenced by Joy Division and the Cure. If you liked their ""New Age"" single, this album isn't too far off from that. Just forget that it's the same Blitz and pick it up. I'm sure you can find it for 2-5 dollars and it's totally worth it."
1,BORING!,BOOOOOOORRRRIIIINNNGGG!!! is all I can Say Don't waste your $ People its not worth it as the Previous Viewer said its Bad.
4,"gripping ,exciting plot",I was looking forward to reading this after seeing all the other great reviews on it and wasn't at all disapointed! The storyline moves very quickly and the killer is extremely deceptive (which makes for many close calls for our heroine)! It wasn't particularly terrifying but was very exciting. One I would recommend you read.
5,Five stars is NOT enough,"I just loved this book. Danielle Girard did a fantastic job with this first novel. This book reads so fast but, it will keep you reading long into the night. She is able to make you feel for her main character (Casey).The only thing I can think of to say is BUY THIS BOOK, you won't regret it. Happy reading"
3,so-so first effort,"There are dozens of serial killer novels out there, and this one is no better or worse than most of them. Once again, the killer has the escape skills of Houdini combined with the disguise skills of Lon Chaney. The psychology is especially weak, as we never really get into the head of the psychopath, leaving him a shadowy figure at best. Some of the situations seem a little too contrived to be totally believable, the FBI profiler's bitterness seems to overwhelm the rest of her personality, and the ending seems especially forced so as to result in the classic (now cliched) mano a mano showdown."
5,a compelling read,"I am a very busy professional who usually manages to read about 3 pages of any book before falling sound asleep. However, I got my copy of Savage Art yesterday and promptly stayed up until 3 AM devouring it, despite the fact that the later it got the more scared I became of every noise in the night. The story is fast-paced, intelligent, and extraordinarily suspenseful. And the protagonist, Casey McKinley, is the kind of character we'll want to read about in future books. I highly recommend it, and am waiting impatiently for the sequel already."
4,Girard really knows how to build suspense,"I will admit that this is NOT usually the kind of book I read; for one thing, it's a serial killer novel, and for another, it deals with the murder and mutilation of children. However, a friend gave me a copy and I plunged into this dark, dark tale. I think FBI profiler Casey is a wonderful character, and the book is so suspenseful that I could barely put it down until the chilling climax. But ""Savage Art"" is definitely not for the squeamish. It's pretty graphic and violent. Still, if you're a fan of Patricia Cornwell and Thomas Harris, I'd have to say it's a do-not-miss."
1,MIA - Missing In Action,"It's been a whole month, and still no Jodeci CD. At first the sender said that my CD was returned due to the mailing, but that can't be true. Why? Because the rest of my order had arrived, with the same information, at least two weeks before I was notified of the return.NOT THIS SENDER!!! DON'T TRUST IT!!!"
3,similar to the feeling forever my lady gave me,"Like Jodeci's first album, Forever My Lady, Diary of a Mad Band starts off wonderfully. My Heart Belongs to You, Cry For You, and Feenin are incredible songs just as Stay, Come and Talk to Me, and Forever My Lady were on the first album. These songs are obvious masterpieces. But after the first couple songs, the CD disappoints. Jodeci turns away from what made those songs great and once again sing about bumpin and grinding rather than making love. Their vocal talents are still immeasureable but the approach they take in the later songs on the CD are faulty. Try to find this CD used."
3,"Jodeci can't make u dance, but can make u love, lust & long","Jodeci has a talent for ballads. They must know this because the album opens with 4 straight slow tempo(ed) tunes of longing, loving, losing and lusting. After that, they try to get upbeat and end up getting nearly pornographic, all subtlety is gone. Jodeci has definite skill and K-Ci's voice is as distinguishable and pleading as Al Green's. This album is a must for any Jodeci fan, and the excellent ballads compensate for the rest of the album."
4,"Some Sweet Lovin,","Much olove on this tip. Being a white boy in high school, I have often found myself serenading ladies with these tracks to persuade the ladies to swing my way, and it always worked. That is the true measure of an album's greatness."
3,Not their best album,"The album starts off GREAT with the romantic ""My Heart Belongs to U"", where the Hailey Brothers show us that they still got got what it takes to win females over. The classics continue with ""Cry For U"", a favorite amongst 10th graders like myself at the time. But even better than that song was ""Feenin'"" and ""What About Us"" as DeVante provides great musical backdrops. However, as soon as the uptempo songs start, the album falters. The fast tunes aren't as good as they were on their first album (reminds me of a certain new-generation Jodeci who has those same problems, first name Dru?). So after Side 1 (1993 was still the ""tape"" era), I stopped playing the album."
4,STILL FOREVER JODECI,"THIS CD IS BASICALLY VERY GOOD AS FAR AS THE SLOW SIDE GOES, I COULD DO WITHOUT THE DANCE SIDE, SAME AS THE 1ST CD, BUT I STILL LOVE THESE BOYS...ALWAYS"
3,Good saw if you can get it at the right price.,"I agree with most of what the Amazon.com reviewer had to say about the Delta MS350 except for the comment on dust collection;I think dust goes everywhere EXCEPT the dust bag. This saw is certainly a step up from the MS 250 in quality and power but is still a lower end saw that has ok mitering capabilities. I am somewhat confused as to the pricing of this unit and it's availability. Amazon has the MS 350 for 179.00 and Sears (my place of purchase) has the same model for 99.00, the same price as the MS 250 it was replacing. It is possible that Sears simply made a mistake when selling it to me though. The saw was not out on display but their website advertised it at 99.00, this was last November, 04 when the transaction took place. If they (Sears) are still selling this model at that price then it would be advisable to stop by and pick one up. Looking at it from that perspective (purchase price), it can't be beat."
4,Classical guitar,"There are a few instruments played solo that have the rare quality of encouraging contemplative thought. The three that come to mind are piano, flute and classical guitar. This is a nice recording of some standard classical guitar pieces that are easy to listen to and relaxing."
5,The Bible for Aircraft Builders,AC 43-13 is the bible for those who choose to restore or build aircraft of all types including experimental and ultralights. f you have a question about acceptable construction practices the answer is usually in 43-13. Selecting wood for a project the nswer is there. Aircraft covering the answer is there. Installing safety wire the answer is there. I have build three aircraft from scratch and find 43-13 and essential reference.
2,Expected Better,"I bought this book after reading Mr. Boynton's obituary of Ian Smith. I thought this would be quite a controversial read, bringing to the table the intriguing issue of the trade off between majority rule and the total collapse of every African country that gained it. At the least I thought there would be more about the life of the last whites in Southern Africa. Instead the book's a collection of vignettes of various characters and seemed to be lacking any central theme."
4,get it for the gazetter and overview of local roads,"Like other DeLorme atlases this one shows nearly all the back roads in the state of New Jersey (yes, we do have back roads here!). There are a few minor errors, but the biggest problem is that there are very few names of roads. It makes it hard to tell if you're on the right road and useless for trying to look up an address. Unlike other DeLorme atlases, this one has close up maps of the major metropolitan areas with almost all the streets, again lacking a few names. The Gazetter part is great. It has recreation areas, some canoe trips, tons of historic sights, unique natural features, some scenic drives, Atlantic City casinos, some golf courses, attractions, sking, lots of wildlife viewing plases, hiking trailshunting, fishing, and all the private campgrounds in the state."
4,Good for certain tasks,"I originally bought this dust collector for my lathe and easy cleanup. Unfortunately the CFM's (suction) isn't exactly high enough to suck up the shavings for a larger lathe. On the other hand, if you have the right atachments it works well for a mini lathe (or pen lathe). Futhermore, with the right attatchments, this works great for just about every other tool I have used it on in the workshop such as a surface planer, drill press, bandsaw etc., as well as making cleaning the floor much easier too. If the intention of your dust collector is going to be to catch shavings from a larger lathe I would reccomend at least an 850 CFM or higher, however, overall I would recommend this tool for anyone with a pen lathe or using this for just about any other tool in the workshop, because it will work great."
2,Clogging issues with planers,"Out of the box, the unit would clod very quickly when attached to a planer taking 1/16 of a 4"" board (something a 650 CFM dust collector should not have a problem with). The problem is caused by a crossbar in the 4"" inlet which appears to have been added to prevent someone from sticking there hand up into the impellers. Longer shavings from the planer get caught on the bar and then in turn help catch later pieces. I could probably be sued for suggesting people fix the problem the way that I did, so instead I would suggest the slightly more pricy JET which does not have a crossbar. Another reviewer went up in size instead and I think that is probably overkill for most small, single operator, shops."
1,Don't Buy It,"30 micron bags this product uses makes it worthless for saws. It lets too much dust get through. Buy a collector with 5 micron or less bags or canister filter. The AP400 lets a lot of fine dust through the standard bags and blows it all around your workshop. I think this is a big health risk.If you get this collector due to limited space or power requirements, throw out the original 30 micron bags. Replace them with Delta's 5 micron bags, Penn State Industries (PSI) 1 micron bags, PSI canister, or Grizzly's 5 micron bags or canister. Any 14.5 inch diameter dust collector bag or canister will work.Works fine for a planers and jointers. They don't generate fine dust."
1,Not good for tools running on 220V power,"This 1HP collector was barely okay when I was running a contractor saw, DeWalt planer and Rigid 6"" jointer. (one machine at a time) Since I upgraded to 220V planing, jointing and sawing power, the collector has proved itself useless. Constant clogging of the intake port (at the cross-hairs underneath the impeller) and not enough airflow to extract certain heavy shavings (poplar, mahogany, etc) from ejection ports of the specific machines (planer, jointer). This leads to constant shutdown for manual extraction. You will be severly disapointed if you try to run heavier duty equipment on this machine. It is possible that my ducting runs were too long, but I doubt it. (See some of the Fine Woodworking's reviews on collectors to confirm my situation)."
3,Delta AP400 Dust Collector,"I used the machine for about 18 months. A few weeks ago it started making a rumbling noise. Later it started smelling hot and vibrating more. A couple times it ground to a halt. I took it apart today and checked the bearings. They were fine, but the shaft and rotor were damaged. A new motor from Dewalt is $199. I paid $169 for the whole thing! It worked OK for a while, but I wouldn't buy one of these if you are going to use it a lot. Bag changing is a real pain. The newer models have a better arrangement than the 400's buckle and strap. The 30-micron bag does let a lot of fine dust through."
1,Motor problems!!!,"The motor started smoking on initial start-up. We're not talking about a little bit of smoke - we're talking enough smoke to fill my workshop with a thin fog! Thinking maybe it just had something to do with the break-in I plugged it back in and tried to start it up and the motor was seized. I contacted Amazon and they sent a replacement right away (had it in 2 days to be exact).I set the replacement up and the same thing happened to the new machine!!! I contacted Amazon and they refunded my money and paid for the return shipment. They said they would contact their distribution center and stop shipping the units. They also allowed me to substitute to the JET model as well. 5 Stars for Amazon, 1 star for the Delta AP400."
4,Solid product.,I've configured this with a T and two slid shut outlets. On one end is the hose for the planer and on the other I have slid on/off connectors for use with a radial arm saw and a jointer. It sucks up all the particles except in rare instances when a chip blocks the mechanism or dust clogs in the dust hose (usually when the planer blades are dull). I'd buy this machine again without hesitation. It's also easy to remove and reinstall the bag once you get the knack for it.
4,Great tool,"This product has exceeded my expectations, however, this is my first dust collector so I don't have anything to compare it to."
1,thanx to Delta,"Tnaks to Delta for stopping further distribution of this machine. Like some of the other owners who complained of seized motors, mine did the same. But I use my only very seldom so the machine was out of warranty when the motor burned up but it had less that 1 hour of use time on it. When I checked about replacing the motor I found it costs over $200. The machine didn't cost that much. This was my first (and last) piece of Delta Equipment."
4,Very good Dust Collector (after modification),"Have had the AP400 for a couple of months now and have had the same broblem with clogging on the planer as another reviewer, shavings getting hung up on the little cross bars at the inlet. I solved the problem with a slight modification (it involved metal snips) and it now works fine with no clogging! I have it connected with overhead pipe system (standard old galvinized vent pipe from my local home center) with T's coming off to four different machines with blast gates on each T to allow one at a time to be used. Works great you don't have to keep fooling with the large hose moving from one machine to another, just close and open blast gates as needed. When not in use I can disconnect the hoses that run from the blast gates at the T's down to each machine and roll all the equipment out of the way (I am set up in my garage works great."
4,Delta Dust Collector,I've had this about a month and think it is great. My major piece of equipment is a radial arm saw and it beats the shop vac I was using hands down. I have plans of hooking it up to several small machines with blast gates. I'll only be using one at a time and don't think there will be any problems. The only negative I really have is the same as some other reviewers. The shipping stinks. If I had been home when the package arrived I would have refused it. To my surprise nothing was missing from the broken open box and other than a little scuffed paint there was no damage. While I like to scuff my own paint on a new item it wasn't that bad. Although it isn't Amazon's fault that the box was torn up in transit it will make me think twice about ordering such a large item from them again.So far I really like the machine.
1,Save your money,"I tried using this unit on a jointer and planer and it could not handle either of them without clogging. If you are only using on saws, it might be sufficient. I bought at local store and returned it the same day. I will be getting a larger unit."
3,delta doesnt know how to package their product,"The item arrived promptly with only a slight indentation in one corner of the box. Item was assembled and started. There was a severe vibration,and unit was turned off. When attempt was made to turn on unit again it would sometimes start and sometimes not. Never got to actually use the unit before returning to amazon. Replacement arrived with severe damage to the box. This unit was refused. An order was placed for the JET model of the same size that works fine. We already have a delta model that was purchased locally that works fine."
3,Packageing,"I machine so far works well, however I got a scare when I opend the box and everything was covered in a white powder. I got scared and called the Sheriff with what is going on in the world today.Well come to find out it was what they put in the box to control moisture, they put a package containing lime. And the package got punctured somehow,I had never heard of that before I have always seen silicon gel used for that purpose. I suggest they use something else."
3,Review for Blue Shock-World Longboard Championship Makaha,"Good surfing footage of the 8 quarterfinalists and old shots of Makaha. However few repeat shots are shown. I wish the video would have more shots and stories on the other contestants, the relatively unknown longboarders who have made it to the world contests, who are not in any of the other videos."
3,Good,"Like Audioslave's debut, this album works but is just not as good as the member's former bands, maybe it's not a fair comparison but it's natural... well, maybe better than GnR, but definitely not STP... I just got it and I haven't heard it enough yet but it is worth listening to and I might like it better after more listening..."
2,Not awful but nothing really good.,"Its alright, but it sounds like Scott Weiland and the chaps from Guns 'n Roses just want to make a big loud wailing noise and not care about the music so much which is a shame.Its dissapointing considering how great the Stone Temple Pilots and Guns 'n Roses were.Rule number 1: If your gonna form a band with people from two famous bands, then do something new and exciting - these guys did'nt do that and have just added to the recen unexciting musical land scape."
1,Time to throw in the towel,"I thought this CD was horrible....Personally I think if your a old school G&R fan or an STP fan you will be throughly disappointed as I was...""Slither"" is one of the only decent songs on the CD (and I stress decent because it is not that great)...Maybe its just me but I really really thought it did not live up to STP or G&R type of expectations...Maybe a better producer would have helped..Want to hear a meshing of 2 bands for a good sound then go get AUDIOSLAVE...just click your back button and get as far away from this CD..."
5,Absolutely Amazing,"This is it, this i how rock is supposed to be. I am a HUGE GnR fan this is album will keep me busy until CHINESE DEMOCRACY ever?? comes out. It definitely grows on you, standouts are Fall to Pieces, Headspace, Slither, Set Me Free, You Got No Right, and Loving the Alien"
1,Major disappointment.,"There's already been a ton of reviews for this record but I still feel like chiming in my two cents. I, like most people here, rushed out and picked up this album when it was first released and it was a mistake. To me the whole album seems rushed and not very well written. Most of the songs sound the same and have all the same riffs. The tracks aren't even as good as STP's worst stuff and I can't hear a single hint of GNR in any song. I say stop this nonsense and give me back STP and old school GNR."
2,meh...,"i don't know what it is but this just does not sound like rock and roll to me.in my opinion the songs sound too polished and almost have a punk/alternative sound to them.sometimes you even forget Slash is on guitar.maybe it will grow on me,but on first listen,this album just doesn't rock my socks."
3,Contraband: Weiland's Public Service Hours,"It's a tough thing when one band joins the singer from another. Success greeted Audioslave, and the same was expected from the GN'R/STP crossover. After hearing the first two releases off this album (Slither, Fall to Pieces), I decided to pick it up. While being a good rock album, lyrically it misses the mark. Good guitar solos keep a few songs afloat - saving them from drowning in Weiland's either quirky or self-serving lyrics. I do think, however, that their follow-up will be a great album. That is, as long as Weiland can keep himself out of rehab long enough to make one. The chemistry is there - you can hear that they're almost hitting the nail on the head, but every now and then they keep slipping and smashing their thumbs. I'd recommend getting it if you want a rocking album, because it is that - just don't expect brilliance quite yet. Just remember, this band is neither Gn'R nor is it STP. If you go into it knowing this, you'll be fine."
4,Get your rock on!,"Did you like ""You Could Be Mine"" from the Terminator 2 soundtrack? Did you enjoy the vocals from Stone Temple Pilots? I did, and that is what this album is about. Duff's amazing tone, Slash's guitar burping out riffs and rhythms, Scott's urgent vocals, and amazing drumwork."
4,A Really Big Surprise,"I bought this not expecting too much but it really got me into it... there are incredible heavy guitars and the lyrics are Weiland's classic style. Songs like the single ""slither"" and ""sucker train blues"" (great opening) or ""loving the alien"" are really gorgeous... The package is pretty good and the pictures shows a band in their perfect moment... I really recommend all of you fans of good rock music(from bob dylan to the beatles, from Guns n' roses to STP)to buy this album, cause i think they're gonna do so much more than the other amazing superband audioslave did, for sure..."
1,Copy protection compromises the safety of your PC,"This CD comes with copy protection software, which, when installed, wrecks havoc on your computer and instantly compromises your online security and safety. Ugly, malicious forms of spyware are loaded, and your PC will soon be hijacked. Is this any way to treat customers? I love VR, but Sony/BMG must do away with copy protection and respect our RIGHT to make legitimate copies as we so desire. After all, the number of music fans with iPods is growing."
3,"Good CD, security too restricitve!","Good CD, but the ""security"" on it is ridiculous. I put this CD in my computer to listen to it. It immediately wanted me to load stuff to my computer. I don't like extra stuff on my computer, so I clicked no, and it ejected the CD!!! I reloaded it, and when it asked again to load stuff, I opened Musicmatch to play it...it played like it was skipping, so I thought it was the program so I tried playing it with Windows Media Player, and it souned terrible again. I tried the simple CD player that came with my computer, and it still didn't play right. I took the CD to my car, it sounds great! Took it to work, and my computer there just locks up when I put the CD in. So, it's a good CD, but don't try listening to it on a computer!"
5,"""Greatest Rock Album Of The 21st Century"".","Stone Temple Roses? Guns & Pilots? Who the hell needs Axl?Scott Weiland and Slash pound out the ""Greatest Rock Album"" since ""Appetite For Destruction"". Every track sizzles with great vocals and unleashed guitar riffs. I can't stop listening to this CD or I'd write a longer review! Buy it! You won't be disappointed! My name is Dennis, and I approve this message!"
5,Better than expected,"This CD rocks, and actually has me excited again about music. I would put it this way: If GnR's Appetite for Destruction and STP's Core got together and had a kickass kid, it would be Contraband. I say that because, you can sense a little of both in it, but it is still it's own album, and it rocks from beginning to end. BUY IT, it's worth it.Suggested Use:Listen to 3 times a day.Common Side Effects:Urge to drink hard liquor and drive at excessive speeds."
3,Solid effort,"Velvet Revolver is neither as good as Guns n' Roses or Stone Temple Pilots were. Still, the music is better than most of the other new bands that are currently blossoming. Slither is the best song, and it should not have been released as the first single--although good, the other songs do not measure up. Absolutely disregard the review by a critic called ""Kongfuzi""--this person must be confused and/or mentally ill. Overall--a solid rock album for VR to build upon."
3,"good album, bad record company","To any iPod users - be aware that you CANNOT PLAY THIS RECORD ON YOUR IPOD!! BMG has put some software on the record that enables you to only save the tracks to your computer as 128kbps wma files - lame-ish sound quality and not supported by iPod. They also install a small app on your computer before you can even listen to the disc. Betting that I like BMG artists more than I like my iPod is a loser's bet. I will be returning this cd. Too bad, as I'm sure I would have liked it, but my iPod has to take precedence.LATER REVIEW INDICATES THAT YOU CAN SAVE TO IPOD BY HOLDING THE 'SHIFT' KEY WHEN INSERTING THE CD INTO YOUR DISC DRIVE - I'LL GIVE IT A SHOT."
4,Go Slash,"This CD is great. I got it for Christmas, and listened to it over and over again. I like to see it selling well and on VH1 and MTV, instead of that rap crap a lot of losers like. Also, this CD conatains some insane solos. Dirty Little Thing has the best solo on the CD, even though it isn't a great song otherwise (does anyone but me think it sounds way too much like Sucker Train Blues?) Anyways, it get 4 stars because the music is awesome, the lyrics are good, but the 1 star is taken away for crappy mixing. Scott Weiland is too hard to hear, and Slash's solos need to be mixed more into the foreground."
4,Pretty good rock album,"""Contraband"" by Velvet Revolver isn't as good as Guns n' Roses or Stone Temple Pilots, but it still packs a few good rock tracks on. ""Slither"", ""Fall To Pieces"", and ""Dirty Little Thing"" are some of my favorites. Add it to your collection if your looking for a new rock album to add to your library."
4,Putting the Rock back into Rock N Roll,"In a world where Vince Neil is getting plastic surgery on TV and Avril Lavigne is considered punk thank god for Slash and Velvet Revolver for putting things back in perspective. It may not be the greatest rock record, however it still rocks harder than anything released in the last 5 years and that's saying alot......."
3,Just love that Slash....,"Before I even knew who Velvet Revolver was I was listening to the radio and heard Broken... I recognized the distinct playing style of Slash immediately. A 20-something in the 80's I loved Guns & Roses and just fell in love with the sound of Velvet because of sentimental reasons I'm sure.I have to say though, while I find this CD great for pumping off 400 calories on the eliptical, there are some of the songs that I just don't like, they are almost too busy - but some are destined to become classics.Advice, if you love Broken and are looking for a CD that will have that sound all the way through, don't buy it, however, if you love a good ballad or two mixed with some good jam for head banging, buy it! :)"
4,Good Rock CD,"The CD sounds good from start to finish. The music is a crossbetween GNR and STP. The guitar riffs are great, and the overallsongs are good. In my opinion the best songs are:HeadSpace and Dirty Little Thing. The vocals also sound good.We finally get a band where the vocalist DOES NOT SCREAM, heactually sings!"
5,Great!,"This is a Great cd I love it, and I am tired of people saying that it doesn't sound like GNR or STP, well it doesn't have to sound like these bands because it is a DIFFERENT BAND!, it has a great sound and lyricaly is even better.Buy this cd, turn up the volume on the speakers, and rock away."
4,One of the best rock albums in a long time.,"This is actually a great album. Every song is consistently strong. Scott's vocals are solid. Slash's ability seems a little held back by the band. His killer blues style is restrained and overpowered by very heavy guitar riffs. Some soulful solos would add nicely to the mix. However, from what I read, a heavy sounding record was their goal. So congratulations; you've succeeded. The rock riffs are solid, and a breathe of fresh air from what's on the scene today. For such different backgrounds, their sounds mesh together well for something new. ROCK ON!"
5,"Pure rock, n' pure roll","You want your fix of true rock n' roll and not this pansy Nickelback crap on rock radio now, this is the best 'new' CD around for that fix. Slash, Duff, and Matt show why Guns was awesome, and Wieland shows he's got great vocal skills. Kushner provides great layers to Slash's leads. (...)!"
5,Contraband is Scary Good!,"This album is unbelievable. Every track could have been a single and been the best song on the radio. This is not only the best rock album of the year, but I'm going to go out on a limb and say ""This is the best rock album in the last 10 years""."
2,Eh...,"I guess nothing could live up to the hype- great musicians from great rock bands pulling together to ROCK! But it feels forced. Slash sounds like he's trying to remember the opening to ""Sweet Child O Mine"" at the beginning of several of these songs. Overall, the record lacks any dynamics. From the get go, it's in your face riffin'. That's cool, up to a point. Even AC/DC new how to mix it up when the gettin' was good. Scott is also missing the great melody making of STP. His ability to both melodicize and rage has been lost in the mix. The result is kind of like Alice in Chains on a hangover.Better luck next time. Yes, I do hope there is a next time."
1,Doesn't Play - Suncomm Copy Protection,"This CD does not play in my car, nor can I copy it onto my iPod. It requires files to be installed on the PC to play.Avoid this disc and do not encourage more copy protected CDs that cause problems."
3,Let Down,"After reading all the hype, I was expecting this disc to be incredibly powerful rock. There are a few tunes I like but none that knock me out. Overall, it's just too much of the same thing. I've given it three complete listens and it's not growing on me."
1,Good Thing Axl didnt do this,"Wow Axl should be happy that he is not into this so called ""MUSIC"" , because one thing, without axl , GNR wouldn make it so far as they did, and you can see it in this so called ""CD"" because VR SUCKS!!! i mean come on how can u call this music?? it is just a noise, without axl those guys are nothin and they sshould deal with it and not keep trying to be famous again because they are just wasting their time..without axl theres nothing in this cd see ya! by the way you cant even rip for ipo i mean come on!!! the 99% of the people that lsiten to music have an ipod i think that not includin this wasnt very smart from Velvet revolver"
2,Nothing Special,"I don't know what it is about this album, none of the songs on it stand out to me. There is really nothing memorable about it, I can't really explain why. It feels empty. Whenever I listen to a good rock album, I get a great feeling with every good riff. But with this, it's like elevator music or something, just playing in the background.Plus the CD is all copy protected, which is just a nuisance since you can get it onto your computer anyway. I don't know why they did that. All in all, I just am not feeling this album."
2,I was expecting so much more.,"I don't really have much to say. I really can't praise this album.....at all.Since I had the chance to listen to it repeatedly at the cd store I work at, it NEVER grew on me. Sad to say. I wish it was something else but seems Scott wants to emulate Axl Rose and I don't really particularly care for him much either, so it's a double whammy right there.Buy it if you want to. Seems everyone else likes them. I just don't."
2,First Impression: More to come......,"I agree that the production is less than one would expect from such an important supergroup collaboration. And why would you have the single (""Slither"") be the one standout track, in terms of tempo, time changes and overall ""jam-ability"", among mostly similar songs!? Not as impressive as it should be -BASED ON ONE SPIN>more to come..."
1,"I paid for a CD, I should be able to make MP3's!","What kind of crap is this? They're telling me that I can only use what Microsoft pushes? Never again will I buy a CD like this. I should have just downloaded it for free. But wait that's dishonest, or is it better to be a sucker, pay for crap, and give my buyer's rights up? What kind of choice is that? Don't buy this or any CD's like this!!! If we pay for something we should be able to play it on any device of our choosing!!!"
1,Copy Protected,"It's ridiculous how protected the cd is, and what you must to do get around it just to put the songs in your library or on your iPod. This is really screwing their customers. I bought the CD because the songs are better quality than buying them from ITunes or an online store, but in this album's case, you might as well just buy the songs you like online, I don't recommend buying the cd. What a waste!"
1,WILL NOT play on your computer,"The band is great I'll give them that, but the software on the CD prevents it from being copied to your computer. You cannot even play it without being asked to answer an agreement that invades your privacy (meaning everytime you play the track they'll monitor what you do with the track). The only way you can hear the music is through a normal CD player. Food for thought: if WE as the consumer but the CD legally we should at least be able to hear it."
4,Awesome Hard Rock Album,"I really enjoyed this album. An amazing effort from all 5 members. I liked Guns n' Roses first and foremost. But when I heard ex- Guns n' Roses members Slash (lead guitar), Duff McKagan (bass) and Matt Sorum (drums) were combining their efforts with Scott Weiland (ex- Stone Temple Pilots vocalist), I had to check this out.I was pleasntly suprised. Great intros, solos- you name it. I particularly love Slash's intro to ""Set Me Free"". And Scott Weiland delivers lyrics-wise. The mixing is a little off-beat but other than that, this is a masterpiece. A brilliant piece of music. And this puts any nu-metal/rock band to shame with blistering guitar riffs and powerful vocals that shake the album with a raw anger that GnR (Guns n' Roses) fans may remember from Guns n' Roses' incredible debut album, ""Appetite for Destruction"".So if you're into the 80s hard rock, some metal- you will definitley enjoy this album and I recommend you pick up your copy. You won't be disappointed."
5,About Time,"In the past couple of weeks I have bought the new Method Man, Lenny Kravitz, Incubus, and Everlast, and with the addition of Velvet Revolver this has been a very good CD year. This CD ROCKS, it has to be one of the best rock albums I have heard in a long long time, I would advise everyone that wants to hear some really good music pick up Contraband. And by the way Audioslave ROCKS!!!!!!!"
2,Disappointing...,As a hard rock fan since the 70s I had high hopes for this one. Unfortunately I lost interest after about the 4th tune. This is corporate rock at it's most boring. It reminds me of bands like Boston or Journey- just a bit harder. It seems that these guys need to recharge their bank accounts after not doing much since their respective glory days. Try Opeth or Clutch if you're looking for kick-butt rock with a creative touch.
4,It Could Use A Remix,"Overall, I like this album; good songs and good music. I noticed quite a bit of vibrato in most of the music, which gives it a sort of a shred sounding feel. I don't know if that was intentional or not, but I personally feel it takes away from what could have been a ""Back In Black"" debut experience for Velvet Revolver. Maybe a remix could tone down the vibrato to smooth out that grating, fluctuating quality in the music. Other than my minor gripe, it's a good album ... I just think it could have been better."
4,Velvet Revolver - Guns Meet Pilots,"Velvet Revolver is the supergroup that featured several former members of Guns And Roses (Slash, Duff Mcagen, and Matt Sorum) along with former Stone Temple Pilots frontman Scott Wieland. The band only lasted two albums, but this first one was quite good producing some great sleazy rock n roll. This is a great one to crank on your car stereo. For the most part the material is strong. Slash throws in a lot of grungy guitar and although it gets slightly nu-metal-ish at times there is enough good old school rock n roll to make Guns and Pilots fans happy I think. The album produced several hit single including ""Slither"" and ""Fall To Pieces"". The disc does suffer from a bit of a muddy cluttered mix at times which is somewhat distracting. I have to be in the right mood to listen to this album, but at times it is just what the doctor ordered."
4,Almost Every Song Is A Hit !!!,"I love Guns N Roses and when I heard that Slash and Duff were going to make a superband I was hyped about it. It took me a few weeks to pick this up after it came out but when I did I fell in love with it :) Some of the best songs on it are Slither (the single), Big Machine, Headspace, Superhuman, and basically all of the others except for 1.I'm really looking forward to the sequel to this and it's coming out in less than 7 days - so it's already a must buy for me :)"
5,Insane,"I can't believe how many bad reviews this cd has gotten. First off, there's nothing wrong with the sound quality, in fact it's some of the best I've heard in a long time. I think the sound of Velvet Revolver is refreshing, Scott Weiland teams up with the former members of Guns N' Roses, who knew that'd be a good combination? I can't wait for their second album. This is low-down, gritty, at times borderline biker metal. Check this CD out. Be sure to turn your auto run off to avoid BMG's copy protection virus."
4,good cd buy it,"this cd is good...uve probably heard the single slither,, so yea buy the cd NOW!!!!!....ok ive never heard the cd just yet but it sounds good"
3,Not as good as it should have been.,"To much hipe is for sure.This album was much talked about and I bought it to support the ex-gunners and Scott.Few good songs on this cd.Theres only three catchy songs on the cd and that sucks.With all the talent in this band they couldn't put out a straight forward rock album.I'm not to happy about this cd.Save your cash and if you got a friend that has the cd,just burn it."
1,why revisit the 80s,"I thought the CD was okay, but after seeing this band live I realize it is just regurgitated 80s rock. G n R were okay, as was STP. but the seperation of those bands should have ended all there careers. what made these people good in there time was a combanation of more than a just few things with their original bands, Both Wieland and Slash dont seem to be very capatibal with one another. its almost as if they are running on some hogwash script for 12 year old and little girls. a dire shame to see these people sink to this level"
2,Gets 2 and a half.,"You think would'nt you with Scott Weiland (Stone Temple Pilots) and the lads from Guns n roses could make a record a bit better than this.It has its moments and is worth a listen, but after all the radio plays its got, its just darn annoying!"
3,Time for change,"It's time for change in the G 'n R camp. Axl's getting out of control, and his voice no longer sounds like it used to. On this record, his voice is downright bizarre-sounding; I just can't pinpoint this freak anymore.On a more positive note, Slash and Izzy are in top form on the long-awaited ""Contraband."" Izzy in particular sounds rejuvenated and ready to rock.My biggest complaint is that Steven Adler wasn't invited to the party - he's one of the best drummers to grace the planet, and his absence is conspicuous. We can thank Axl for this blunder, since he's the one who booted Adler out of the band.Overall, it's mostly good to see these guys back together again, save for the out-of-control Axl Rose. Let's hope G 'n R revive the grunge loss we all suffered through, nearly a decade ago.BYE!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,The Great Rock 'N Roll Swindle,"This album is nothing more than rehashed STP and GNR cliches. Looking for innovative, groundbreaking rock? You won't find it here. Rather than moving forward, Velvet Revolver are merely living in the past, and it sucks. Guys, 1987 called; they're sick of you. Feel free to join us in the year 2005 anytime!"
1,SAVE YOUR DAMN MONEY!!!,"This is the worst CD I have ever owned. Id rather listen to Hanson. Scott Weiland needs to go back on heroin so his music will be good again. As for the rest of the band, they all need to retire becasue the music sounds like G-N-R. Originality maybe?"
1,so sad,"Stone Temple Pilots Scott Weiland=GOODVelvet Revolver Scott Weiland=BADIf you want to hear some awesome Scott vocals stick to STP, it's your best bet. VR is awful! I had high hopes for Velvet Rovolver when they first came out but I was extremely disappointed after I bought Contraband....they should ban this cd! I miss the old school, grunge vocals of Scott Weiland. It just breaks my heart, man :( *sniff sniff* I suggest STP's ""Thank You."" It's a great collection of their hits. Listen to that and try to take your mind off what has become of our dear,Scott."
4,Interesante Albun en version Japonesa,Muy interesante version incluye el tema raro en Vivo que solo salio en el single slither eso es bueno para mayor informacion de Velvet Revolver o de Guns N Roses incribirse al club del coleccionista mandando un correo a esta direccion: polarworks_Collectors-subscribe@yahoogroups.comy alli se compartiran noticias de este grupo y de varios mas como musica este club del coleccionista esta en ESPAÑOL.
2,typical supergroup drivel,"Typical...first song released on radio gets your hopes up...then you hear the rest of the cd...what a letdown. I swear, if I hear ""Fall To Pieces"" one more time on radio, Im going to switch to talk radio. Nearly every track on the cd is bland and unmemorable. I swear I tried to like it. But I just couldnt. I ended up giving the cd away. Are there any groups made up of former members of other well known bands that end up being good? I think its a proven formula that this setup only produces one thing...pure crap."
3,Blah,"I've listened through this album 3-4 times now. That was about a month ago, and I have no idea where the CD is now, because I could not care any less about it. It's got a few decent songs (Fall to pieces sounds exactly like a GNR song, for those following at home. Also note that there has never been a song so monotonous ever to receive radio play; I defy the listener not to tire of this song after only, let's say, four listens).The rest of the album just sounds uninspired as is really quite banal. It consists of fast paced, tedious, drums and guitar, with some haphazard singing thrown on top.Remember how Core was one of the best albums of the 90's? Then how 12 gracious melodies was decent, with some damn solid songs on it, but not as good? And then everything after that by STP was laughably bad? This is kind of like that.My recommendation is to buy Audioslave. Now there's an album."
1,I'm guessing I can't download this to my Xbox,"Therefore this CD is a piece of crap ;P.I was gonna buy it, but I've changed my mind."
1,Disappointed,"I love Slashes solos, but don't like the CD that much overall. Scott Weilands vocals are so indistinct...nothing like in STP. The lyrics don't really say anything to me. I've listened to this CD a lot and it hasn't grown on me. Slither is a stand out track though."
2,It's OK,"I really didn't know what to expect so I wasn't disappointed. But I wasn't all that impressed, either.Scott Weiland's vocals tend to get buried in the wall of well, 'noise' produced by the others. It's difficult to understand the lyrics until about the tenth repetition. Lots of almost-thrash.The third cut, Big Machine, was actually my favorite."
1,I wish I had 4 hands to give this album 4 thumbs down...,"This album blows, big time... I should have expected it, there was so much hype surrounding this band, but calling them a ""supergroup"" just because it contains members of GNR, and Scott Weiland is misleading, and is false-advertisement. Slash's riffs are okay, but Weiland's lyrics are more bizarre than ever, and really don't fit the groove or the melody of the songs on the album. I think the GNR guys are just too heavy a rhythm section for Scott Weiland, and these guys just don't fit together. What Scott Weiland needs to do is get real, and call up the Deleo brothers are reform STP, and come back stronger than ever. Slash should just go back to the Snakepit, and the other members should go back to being family men, or studio musicians, or maybe Slash should get them to play in Snakepit with him. All I know is that this album stinks, and I don't see the next album being any better. What a joke of an album and a band."
2,Good music - bad software,"I really wanted to like this album, and I do think it's pretty good....music wise. However, it contains software copyright protection that will mess with your computer and you can forget about bringing along your favorite tracks on your MP3 player because it won't let you!! When will music companies realize that they are just ticking off regular consumers? They are selling digital media, but won't allow us to take full advantage of it. Forget it! Until the RIAA 'gets it', I'm not buying another CD."
2,"Guns n' Revolvers, or Stone Temple Velvets","well, sorry to say, although ""slither"" was great when it came out, it soon died on me, and so did the album. it's pretty boring, i can't get into it. sorry scott, wrong idea, end it all together."
1,Why should I buy this?,"What's the point in buying a cd, when downloading it illegally off the internet will provide me with a product that I can actually use in the ways that I want to? Do the record companies think that this silly copy-protection is going to prevent these MP3 from being traded all over the internet? All its doing is punishing the people who actually paid for the CD. This also makes the downloadable version better and more enticing. If anything, silly copy-protection manuevers like this are only going to promote internet theft. This makes me want to download it off the internet (even though I didn't particularly like the music) and make sure that everyone I know also pirates it off me, just to protest this kind of stupidity. Didn't anyone learn from what happened to Metallica's career after Lars' Napster crusade?"
3,3 star material,"I give this album 3 stars. Wasn't poor or good.""Dirty little thing"" was the best track out there, this is what made me go buy it.Velvet's had something missing in most of their songs. The production lacked.Few of their songs remind me of the 80s, wasn't my type of style.This album was more of a let down for me, wasn't my type of music as I hoped it would be."
2,A new STP?,its in ok cd but they are trying to sound too much like a new stp. and slashes guitar solo's sound like he is stuck in the 80's. i am not saying its not a talented cd but its not a sound of there own
2,Bad Business,While this album is roughly the equivalent of Van Hagar (Two great bands getting together and achieving a sum much less then either was before) the biggest draw back to this disk is the fact that it will not work with iTunes nor with iPOD.Piracy is a problem. Do not punish those that buy the music!
4,Refreshing,"I bought this CD the day it came out, Tuesday the 8th. of June.I was expecting to hear a grunge type lyric attack from Scottwith the ""crunch"" bluesy guitar of Slash. I was surprised by the music filling my ears. The best way to describe the album as a whole is being kicked in the nuts and liking it. It is a very ""rocking"" album. It is heavy but grooving. It has the deep lyrics of STP but still holding the speeding guitar and riffs similar to G&R. I would've liked to hear more signature Slash on the album (G&R fans know what I mean after hearing the CD). There are many singles that are probably going to be released on this album. I read alot of reviews from fans of both genres of Velvet Revolver's past, STP and G&R. If you are not sure about buying this CD, put your fears to rest. Velvet Revolver delievers the goods."
1,Boycott These CDs,"I bought this CD as my ""Featured Selection"" from BMG Music Service. There were no warnings nor statements about any special digital licensing that went with this CD. With shipping and handling, this disk came to over 20 BUCKS!Now, I can understand the music industry's uproar over MP3s and music sharing. But, when I drop that much cash on a CD, I EXPECT TO BE BUYING IT TO USE AS I SEE FIT. Like an increasing number of music buyers, I like to file my CDs away safely and keep the music on a large computer hard drive or portable player. CDs made like this one do not let you do this!I feel bad for the artists, because I wonder how much say they have in this. But I believe that music consumers should boycott these types of manufactured CDs until the music industry gets the message loud and clear: LEAVE THE DIGITAL LICENSING CRAP OFF OF OUR CDs!!!!!"
1,Has copy protection,"The copy protection on this cd prevented me from playing it in the cd players in my car and computer...currently the only two places I can play cds. I've heard a few songs from this on the radio and elsewhere. What I heard was decent, but between the copy protection and the fact that I found the several songs I did hear only mildly interesting I wouldn't buy this if I could do it over again."
3,Pretty good album,"I'm a devoted fan of GNR, so when I saw that 3 members of the long broken up GNR started this new band, I have to admit that I was excited to see what they would come up with. I wasn't dissapointed with the same great guitar riffs from slash, bass lines from duff and beats from matt sorum. An overall good album, more like 3.5 stars, but gets a bit repetitive after you listen to it for a while. Its not what GNR was, and i don't know if it will be, but the future can tell. To fans of both Stone Temple Pilots and GNR, I can't promise you'll like it, but chances are that you will find something to your taste in this album. Scott's vocals are nice on this album. I like this album enough, and I would reccommend you listen to it. Cheers, Di"
4,Just Hold Shift... Not Hard,"Anyone who knows anything about computers should know that, when you put in a cd and something pops up, its because of AutoRun. You can turn AutoRun off in device manager, or just hold shift to bypass it. AutoRun is the only way the music industry can put security on a cd, so if you turn it off, it can't run any security programs off it. They can still screw up some cd burning programs, but you shouldn't be burning it anyway. It's not that hard, people... HOLD SHIFT. Then you can put it in an iPod or whatever crap you want.As for the music, it's a solid rock cd. Not as good as STP, or GNR I suppose, but it's way better than trash from bands like Creed, Default, or 3 Doors Down. The best tracks are Sucker Train Blues, Illegal I Song, Fall to Pieces, Headspace, Superhuman, Slither, and Dirty Little Thing. Get STP's No. 4 if you want an even better rock cd."
1,Yawn,"If you saw Frontline with this band, you know why this album lacks any energy. A great idea that was ruined by the record execs. in order to sell millions. It's all about the cash... what a shame, but I should have known better."
4,Great CD...but a pain,"This is a great CD, and I really enjoyed listening to it...until I Had to put it on my ipod. The only way to get this CD onto your ipod is to copy the music to your hard drive through the media max program that it forces you to use, then open up the .wax file that it rips and play the ripped music on windows media player, and burn a whole other CD...Then (finally), you can play the music through itunes and rip it to your library, then put it on your ipod, without it becoming all jumbled. This CD plays in any other CD player just fine. If you plan on putting this CD on your ipod, plan to set some time aside to do it, or just buy it from itunes ond burn it from there. It is too bad that this CD has to be such a pain, because it really is good."
4,I was able to copy it. Pretty good CD too. Stick it to RCA!!,"I was able to copy the CD with minimum problems. I used roxio ""easy cd creator 5"" first, let the cd download the licensing crap to your computer. open the above mentioned program. in the drop-down box select whichever drive you have the CD in. then click the ""Start.app"" folder. then click ""contents"", then ""resources"", then ""Main"", then click ""content"" and there are your tracks. drag them to the bottom and click record. granted it isn't as easy as hitting ""copy CD"" but it works. i'm listening to the copy right now. so far, no problems and i'm on track 11. i know nothing about the iPod and mp3 problems b/c I don't use them. anyway it's a good disc. check it out.. better yet. get a copy and STICK it to RCA. The band makes peanuts from CD's. They'll be okay. Now if i could only copy DVDs. LaterNate"
2,,this cd isnt band but i wouldnt buy it because of the POS record company there a copy protection on it that puts spyware on your comeputer... Your better off downloading Limewire and downloading it track by track and burning it on a CD yea you may not get all the album art but aleast it works on your compter and IPod
2,"My Review of ""Contraband"" by Rubber Underground","Here's how life works when you're dumb like me: you read how great this CD is. you buy it, even though you feel kind of silly doing so because you know there's no possible way this band cannot suck. you play the CD. it sucks. lame lyrics, dated HairMetal power cords, unintentionally hilarious tough guy sleeve imagery. by this point, you realize that it's time to brush the choppers and change into the PJ's. you fall into a restless sleep, hoping tomorrow will be a better day...."
4,"Amazing band, terrible producer","Most people who buy this album are probably doing so because of Slither, the amazing single which has been played countless times on the radio and MTV. Don't be surprised to find yourself disappointed by the rest of the songs, because Slither is the best one. The production on this album is terrible, yet after a few times listening to this album one can still love the incredible tunes created by these talented musicians. Slash's guitar isn't heard as much as it should be, you hear his riffs in the background but they are drowned out and that is a huge mistake--his playing over the rhythm guitar is what GNR so great. Weiland attempts some new styles with his voice which sometimes work and sometimes don't, but I find that he is at his best in the middle of the album when we hear his classic STP style. Album is definately worth buying, has a few which we'll be hearing on the radio for years to come."
5,Japanese Version,Japanese Version is Normal CD.Not Protected.I can play Contraband for my all player.Very good!!.
4,it's not gn'r fools!,"people, listen. I'm seeing wayyyy too many comparisons to gn'r and stp. sure it has members from both, but it's not meant to be a new guns n' roses record. get it through your thick skulls! It rocks. It rocks hard. Every band member plays great, and the songs are great. Lets leave it at that. Did you idiots really think it would be better than Appetite For Destruction? Did you really think you would get that same feeling? This is a band that stands on their own. Congratulations fellas. Keep the rock n' roll alive."
5,~ROCK IS BACK~,If u like GnR and STP u will love this. And even the casual rock fan should give it a listen.
4,Take Velvet Revolver and call me in the morning.,"Brethren: I have watched for the past decade or more with great contempt and disgust at all this ""rap metal"", ""downer rock"", and corporate ""anger and angst"" that has been polluting the airwaves while being fraudulently passed off as rock and roll. What a travesty.Enter Velvet Revolver: L.A. jackhammer rock at its finest!GnR meets STP for something harder and leaner. These guys are for REAL. This is a shot in the arm for what has been ailing the music scene for FAR too long now. This is what true rock and roll is supposed to be: dangerous, craved by kids, hated by parents and feared by old people.LONG LIVE ROCK!"
3,"whatever your expected, it's probably here","it's sounds exactly like what it is: gnr plus scott.there are some really good songs on here (the singles are actually my favorite on this, which is not usually the case).about half the songs are completely skipable, but personally i think it's worth the price of the album for the good songs.i'd say buy it...i think. at least hear something on the radio from it first."
2,wrong singer,The music rocks. The lyrics and vocals are ridiculous and annoying.Very disappointing choice of a singer.
3,3 stars for the effort,"This album is a very generic rock CD, meaning that it all sounds the same and it lacks the pop (not music style) of the tow band that the band is composed of. i thought they would do a better job with the amount of talent that band had. they just tried way to hard to make a CD that assimilated both former bands' styles but it didn't work. the only way i see anyone loving this album is of you never were into niether Stone Temple Pilots or GNR. if you want a good rock album go out and get Stone Temple Pilots' ""Core"" or ""Purple"" album. those two are CDs that will keep you craving more."
4,Holds It's Own!,"While not the level of ""Appetite For Destruction"" the tunes on ""Contraband"" hold up with the best of anything on Guns' ""Use Your Illusion"" CDs. Scott Weiland is the perfect choice for this allstar jam, hopefully this unit won't implode like Blind Faith or Derek & The Dominoes. I especially liked the ballads but the rockers on here are no mere bombast. Docked a star for derivitive of STP somewhat. If nothing else it shows that Slash was and is and will always be the genius and heart behind Guns 'n' Roses. Get busy Axl, it's gonna take some doing to top this set!!!"
3,"Good, but...","This sounds good...okay...but...slickly blended very heavy overtones of Foreigner, Styx, Prism, Kansas, Boston, etc. instead of what should be a less homogenized merging of the sounds - even evolved at that - which made all these guys famous to begin with. Maybe on their next 'outing' they will emerge with an identity more appropriate to their reputations. This band hints alot of promise, if not compromise. As for the commentary in the editorial about their IQ scores - drop it(!)- these guys are much more brilliant $$$ than the writer suggests!"
3,I really tried to like this album...,"I loved STP and GNR and really looked forward to this album. I bought it on release day, paid full price and kept it in my car CD player for 2 weeks before I realized I just don't like it! Musically, it's technically good - Slash's guitar work is excellent. (I think it'd still be excellent even if he lost both hands!), but this album just lacks *something* - I wish I could put a finger on it. Happy to read others love this album, but I've given my copy away. I will say I love that fact the record company poured tons of cash to promote this band - hard rock/metal deserves somekind of respect. But I'm a much happier driver now that I put Brides of Destruction's ""Here comes the Brides"" back in the CD player!"
3,I was a little disapointed.......,"This album is average at best..... no frills, Scott Weiland has such a great voice but holds back on this album and doesnt let you know what he's got..... a disapointment....."
2,good for getting girls to dance @ a party-that's all!!!,"god,what a truly trendy album.it's like,they gotta make $ but at what expense?!if you've already bought into it,whatever,but it still sounds like chick-rock you'd hear at the cheap strip clubs if you ask me.(which you didn't,but oh well.)stick with old gnr,early pantera,slayer,pumpkins,alice,or anything else with soul-driven material.....keep away from the nu-metallers with dollar signs in their eyes."
2,Unoriginal,"Wow, been looking foward to this CD for a while.. What a dissapointment. It's completely boring and unoriginal, not necessarily bad, but not a single song stands out either. These guys sound like a third rate Alice In Chains, which is sad, but Im not entirely surprised. I was never a huge fan of either Gn'R or StP, but I at least appriciated both. CD is over produced... Too much going on. Lacking decent basic melodies. These guys are trying too hard, the whole effort just comes off as phony. Sounds just like any other nu metal crap to me.. Linkin Park and Puddle of Mudd fans should dig it."
2,Great Songs and riffs spoiled by bad mastering!,"Was looking forward to this release due to the persons involved. Yes, the songs and the whole concept is great but if you are thinking of listening to this on anything more advanced than your car's CD system forget it. It's another loud, dynamically flat mix that doesnt let the music breath. Shame all modern releases seem to be done this way. Could have sounded much more dramatic with the levels pulled back.A missed opportunity. I look forward to the 32bit re-master in twenty years time."
1,"Pretty good album, but not worth giving up your rights.","I am a huge fan of Stone Temple Pilots (I own all of their records and have been to several shows). I was really looking forward to this CD until I found out that it has copy restrictions. Purchasing a CD with copy restrictions (even easily defeatable restrictions) tells record labels that consumers will accept this erosion of their rights, and allows them to more easily introduce further restrictions in the future. If I can't backup the music that I purchased and convert it to whatever format that I wish, I'm not interested. It really makes me sick that Velvet Revolver would support this. Vote with your dollar."
2,Not pleased with anti copy software,"I was eagerly awaiting the arrival for this CD, but to my surprise Velvet Revolver Contraband fell way short. I have given the CD three good honest listens and can't recommend it to any one, let alone have any desire to make copies for my children. I understand the artists not wanting their intellectual property copied and their music and hard work given away, but to install software on the CD to prevent this is just plain insulting. Maybe if record companies lowered their prices and paid the artists in a more timely manner people would not steal music. The guitar work on the album is good but, I feel the next CD from these guys will be better.G.C."
1,Will not play on my computer,This CD won't play on my PC. So I don't even know if the music is good or not.
3,It's good but I wouldn't consider it great,"You would think with this line-up, you can't miss right? A big time supergroup. It's got to be awesome! It's descent but I expected more from these guys. More rockin', harder drivin' tunes to crank up on a summer day. It does have a few tracks #4, 7 and 11 might be worth the price of the cd in itself. But I found that alot of the songs had a heavy punk vibe to them. If you like that then this is for you.If you want to hear a supergroup that lives up to it's name than go get ""AudioSlave"". That rocks!"
2,Caution computer users-The WMA files are terrible,"Just got the cd today. I bought it cause I been getting requests for it. The music is OK, it isn't great. I can't honestly say that any one song jumps out as a hit to me. Part of the problem could be that because I use a computer as a sound system and I'm limited to some of the worst quality WMA files I've ever heard instead of MP3s. VR has decided to put some lame butt anti-copy turd on the disc that forces computer owners to use them. To make matters worse when I tried to close the player it locked up my system.This is not good for me because I do a lot of DJ work and my system runs on a computer. There's no way I could play this disk on the system at my gigs because I can only use the nasty WMA files and I worry that it will lock up my system at the gig. Basicly this was a waste of money for me."
5,Velvet Revolver saves Rock and Roll,"This is a refreshing change from what's currently on the radio.After the first listening I wasn't all that impressed, but it kept growing on me and I'm completely sold now. All but one or two songs are really solid. Headspace, Big Machine, Illegal i Song and Dirty Little Thing are the best songs on this album. Loving the Alien is the best ballad.FYI: I downloaded from ITunes and was able to burn it onto a CD and was able to add to my IPod without issue."
3,A decent album that doesn't live up to the hype,"Okay people, this is a decent album, but honestly, it's nowhere near as good as GNR were in their heyday. I will admit, that it is at least on the same level as STP (if not better), but Slash does nothing but repeat his best GNR riffs, altering them just enough so that Velvet Revolver isn't considered a cover band. And Scott Weiland just isn't up to the caliber of the other guys in the band. Sure, Axl was no great singer either, but you'd think these guys could have got a better vocalist than Weiland, considering their past achievements. For instance, Eric Dover from Slash's Snakepit could have brought more life into the band than Weiland. I think most of the people who are really into this band are people who never saw how great rock bands used to be before grunge. But I guess after years of depressing grunge, even a half-assed effort like this can seem great."
4,A Beam of Light to Shine on Your Frowning Faces,"I've read almost 20 internet reviews on Velvet Revolver's CD ""Contraband"" and it's copy-protected BS, we'll here is 2 ways to get your groove on with nice lil' rippable Mp3s 1. Download ABC (google.com), goto www.suprnova.org, download it (i just did) or make your own. Goto www.download.com, get Easy CD-DA extractor, it's extracts anything. I used it to rip the Final Fantasy X-2 OST which had a pretty tough copy control on it. try it."
1,Can't Copy to my MP3 Player,Like many people I enjoy the use of an MP3 player giving me the freedom to load playlists and have a small carrying profile that fits in any pocket.Velvet revolver may be a good CD but due to the copy proctection I cannot load it to my mp3 player. Forcing me to return the CD since it doesn't do me anygood to own and not enjoy it.
2,Lacks Charisma.,"Contraband has been done before. Even though there are some very good songs here (Do it for the kids, Sucker train blues, Slither, Loving the Alien, etc..), the album lacks charisma. Slash does not have a good guitar tone throughout the album. His playing is not unique anymore. It feels like he's trying to imitate exactly what he did during his years with Guns N' Roses. The riffs are not catchy enough and seem to be all over the place. Its a generic rock album. The only reason it has tasted success is because of all the star members. This album would be more on the unknown side if it wasnt for the ex members of GNR and a notorious drug addict lead singer. This is a ""rock n roll"" band that the music industry expects you to listen and buy. I recommend Silvertide over this.Highliht: Loving the Alien"
3,Nothing compared to GNR,The vocal is weak. Slash can't prove himself really much except a few riffs. I ve been waiting for this cd but now I just wanted to return it.
2,Album OK,"The album reminds us all why Axl Rose is the greatest frontman alive. Whilst Slash and boys play some solid riffs in songs ranging from SLITHER to FALL TO PIECES, it is clear Scott Weiland is not the creative genius Axl is. Most of the songs are mediocre and lack the passion and guts of the old GnR songs. The lyrics are awful in most songs and tend to be very repetitive.If want a decent hard rock record go out and buy Contraband, but if your expecting to hear GnR do yourselves a favour and avoid dissapointment."
2,wish i had previewed,"after hearing the first release from the album, i was excited to purchase what i thought would be a rockin' cd. unfortunately, there are only two good songs on it and it's not worth the purchase, in my opinion. the boys have definitely slowed down and lost their edge in the past few years. if you're expecting the cd to reflect the sounds of the original release, i suspect you'll be as disappointed as i was."
2,Should Have Been So Much Better,"The most obvious comparison for this band is to Audioslave, the other supergroup to form recently. This is necessary because Audioslave set a perfect example of what a group like this should be, while Velvet Revolver failed. Where are Scott Weiland's deep vocals from STP? Where are Slash's amazing riffs and solos? They get lost in the confusing assault of sound on this album. They were too ambitious in trying to create a new sound. They should have done what Audioslave did in taking the amazing music of RATM, and combining it with Chris Cornell's vocal and songwriting talent, and not trying to fuse them together until they find the right sound, which they clearly did. Contraband is a mess of noises that don't really seem to flow together, but there is so much potential for this band. By the way, does anybody else notice that ""Dirty Little Thing"", and ""Sucker Train Blues"" are almost the exact same song?"
1,Regioncode 1,"European buyers be forewarned: The DVD-side of this dualdisc is encoded ""Region 1"". It does NOT play on European DVD- or DVD-Audio-players."
4,4.5 for a killer album,"What a knock-out album !!!i come from a metal world and suprisingly after couple of listenings i couldn't get it out of my CD player.The more i listen to it the more i attract to Scott's voice and Slash's screaming rhythms.some parts reminds me the old GNR's style, can't go wrong with Slash's amazing style.Headspace is the best song, but both Slither and Fall To Pieces makes the album worth buying.Buy it, burn it, steal it, get it."
4,For Those Worried About Copy-Protection -- Download It!,"You can download this whole album for the same price or less, and you don't have to worry about copy protection. And the sound quality is fine, though I'm no audiophile.Anyway, about the album: I've been a Stone Temple Pilots fan and I've listened to Guns N Roses' greatest hits album (which is AWESOME), and let me say this: The artists respective bands were much better than this. However this is still a decent album and it definitely has a few catchy songs. I would recomend this album to someone looking to expand their music collection with good music, but not necessarily to someone who's looking for a band that can ""define"" them like Nirvana did for so many."
3,A bit of a disappointment.,"I'm a big Axl fan, so was gutted when GNR broke up. But then when I heard that they'd hooked up with Weiland I was delighted - he's another vocalist whose work I love. He is wonderful on ""Core"".But... something just doesn't work here. Weiland's voice seems to have lost a lot of its previous power, and the songwriting is weak. There are a one or two OK songs though.The best thing about this album is that it's so lacklustre that it's going to make Chinese Democracy sound even better when it finally comes out!"
3,"Weak Melodies/Lyrics, Good Riffs/Rhythm",The main problem with this album is that they just dont know how to construct a very good melody and even if they did(fall to pieces comes closest to that) they cant give the song good lyrics to go with it or perform it in a way that doesnt come off as cheesy(which fall to pieces sounds like in lue of something similar but better like Sweet Child o' Mine). But that doesnt mean the CD is not enjoyable. it is a good 56 minutes of hard rock but it can get a bit repetitive because none of the songs are that different or that great. you would be better off just purchasing a better hard rock album you dont own yet than getting this. my suggestion is appetite for destruction(since thats basically what this CD is attempting to copy) or maybe even an older band like Deep Purple (try Made in Japan - now thats catchy riff-rock for ya!)
2,Beware of copy protection,"This CD contains the much-maligned Sony-BMG Suncomm MediaMaxx copy protection software. Somehow Amazon missed marking this one as such. This is a warning to customers about the security vulnerabilities that are installed to Windows PC upon use. The ""copy protection"" software is installed if you accept the terms or not, and there are significant vulnerabilities which must be patched if you wish to keep the software and be able to play the disc on your PC. You may also uninstall the software using Suncomm's uninstaller. Both the patch and uninstaller are available at http://www.sonybmg.com/indexmediamax.htmlThe ""music"" on this CD is mediocre filler for my otherwise carefully selected library. Unfortunately, I am limited to using it on arcane CD players, so this one will see very little play in my house."
4,Not Guns and Roses But Still Not Bad,"After a rough and bumpy breakup with Guns and Roses, its members went different ways. After a couple of years in the process Velvet Revolver was formed. With the legendary Slash on the lineup how bad could it be? The result was a rather coarse sound that is very different from Guns'N'Roses. Though not as good as G'N'R, Contraband is a decent rock album that is a lot better than some of the nu-metal of today and pulls of some decent tracks. Though there are couple of songs that are fillers (i.e Headspace) it's a pretty good album pulling off hits like Slither and Fall To Pieces. Along with these songs I also like Big Machine, Do It For The Kids, and Sucker Train Blues in particular. Overall, a solid 13 track album that is worth the money."
2,Circumvent Copyright protection,"Hold down the shift button as you insert the cd into your disk drive and it prevents the copyright software from loading onto your computer. Simple as that. Who would want to spread this generic unmotivated music anyway. Listen to G&R and STP, two drugged out rock bands that are good in their own respects. This amalgamut of talent, Velvet Revolver, turns out to be subpar at best."
2,Clear Channel Riff Rock,"This album doesn't blaspheme Guns n' Roses or Stone Temple Pilots in my opinion, but I'm not infatuated with either band so that isn't saying a whole lot.The production on Contraband is just polished enough to remove all the soul from the songs. None of these numbers are all that well written either, so they definitely could've used some heart. Even the best cuts on here are generic enough to have been written by any pseudo-grunge practitioner on your local eagle nicknamed rawk radio station.My advice is to skip Velvet Revolver unless you're a fanatic of any of the bands these guys used to be in or you've just fallen in love with the stuff you heard on the radio."
2,Blah,"I always liked STP. I never liked GNR. Well, when I heard about this fusion of '90s grunge and '80s metal I nearly fell out of my seat laughing (not really). But really, Scott Weiland's a good singer, and Slash is a legendary guitarist. It should work. Does it? No, not really. I mean, Fall To Peices is okay, but everything else is just bland and boring rock. It's kinda like Audioslave, but only a wee bit worse. I don't see a real future for this supergroup, and hopefully Axl Rose will stop being whiny and reform GNR and STP will get off their extended hiatus."
2,Not awful but its Overated crap.,"C'mon, why don't they do something new and exciting.It sounds like you'd expect, Guns n Roses mixed with the voce of STP, and a lots of guitar riffs played over and over - boring.C'mon, STP and Guns n Roses were great bands who created a new sound.This is just noise though, nothing special, just boring.What the heak is the point of this band ""Velvet Revolver"".??? anyway?They do'nt do anything, and in a few years this album Contraband will be seen as just a hyped up record because the state of music at the moment is so fake and cheap."
2,hohum,"listened to it 3 times, and each time i think its boring, and not catchy. I think G N' R and STP are both better bands by themselves"
2,The whole doesn't equal it's parts,"Man, I had high hopes for this. And maybe that was the problem. Guns N Roses was the last great rock band and Stone Temple Pilots, while not my favorite, at least tried to be unique and had some pretty good songs on their 1st two albums.But this? I was hoping that this would be the ""return of rock"" that everyone was slobbering over. Instead, it is a bunch of tired, uninspired cliches that are basically excuses for Scott Wieland to moan about ""tapeworm abortions"" and sing f**k a lot. And I mean A LOT.Basically, the songs are horrible, the riffing and solos are tired, and the lyrics make no sense at all. I tried to like it, like I tried to like St. Anger. But in the end, it is unlikeable. I guess I'll go back to waiting for the Guns N Roses reunion we all know is coming..."
2,faded glory,"I heard this CD initially from a friend's burned off copy, and it sounded bad. Then I read Brandon Fuller's complaint, and was afraid that burning the CD caused a problem, so I went out and bought a copy. I guess the CD just sucks, because it sounds just like my friend's burned copy, bad."
2,SO BAD IT HURTS.,THIS CD IS SO BAD IT JUST HURTS TO LISTEN TO IT.HOW CAN GREAT TALENT LIKE THIS MAKE SUCH A TRASHY CD.SOME PEOPLE SAY THIS SOUNDS LIKE GUNS N ROSES.THESE GUYS CAN`T HOLD GUNS JOCK STRAP.BUY THIS IF YOU WANT SOME TRASH.
4,Weiland Muzzled in the Booth,"As a big STP fan, I was eagerly awaiting this release. As mentioned in a previous review, the results are not really STP nor GnR but rather a new direction with obvious accents from the two bands. I realized I hadn't heard a true ""rock"" album in a while (unlike the new stuff of Linkin Park, etc). ""Sucker Train Blues"" gets it started with sweet howling siren guitar effects and the classic megaphone. ""Slither"" is obviously a Weiland inspired tune and in my opinion deserves its early airplay. Slash's solo work, particularly on STB and Slither reminds me that most of the younger bands out there are filled with mediocre guitar players by comparison. Sadly, the album is horribly mixed as Weiland's vocals are constantly drowned out. One saving grace...the band will kick it live where Weiland's stage presence simply can't be ignored. See you at the Weenie Roast in CA guys."
5,Velvet Revolver Contraband is a must have disk,"As one would expect when you combine the Guns and Rose's band with the Stone Temple Pilot's frontman you get great music. I didn't appreciate Contraband completely on the first listen, but after have listened to the disk three times I came to the realization that this thing is outstanding. It's full of great guitar riffs and some really good lyrics if you are willing to look past the curse words. I'm sure this CD is going to sell like hot cakes and it'll rise up the charts as more and more people are exposed to it. I highly recommend it! When you buy it, make sure to give it three spins before you pass judgement."
5,GNR + STP = Brillance,"Scott Weiland is one of my favorite singers and songwriters of the 90's. When I heard that he would be the lead singer of the ex GNR members band I was excited. Hearing his voice with Slash's guitar. Amazing. I really like this album. The songs are really good. Slash, Duff, and Matt had the right idea of picking Weiland and this rocks. Favorites include Do It For The Kids, Sucker Train Blues, Illegal i Song, Fall To Pieces , Superhuman, You Got No Right, Slither, Dirty Little Thing, and Loving The Alien. But the rest of the songs are really good too. Recommended."
5,Super Group Super Great,"It was predicted that this band would save rock n' roll, and for me that's what they did. The combination of ex-Gunners with former STP frontman Scott Weiland is fantastic to say the least. If you like Rock n' Roll pick this album up immediatly."
4,stp&gnr,"who would of thought?...scott weiland and surviving members of gnr, along with dave kushner. what do you get?..velvet revolver. yea it seems like people from former bands are now coming together to make music again (example: audioslave). contraband totally rocks...the music is raw and energetic with all the licks and solos and edgy riffs along with scott's vocals. every song here is flawless...but there is just one little problem here. i dont know about anyone..but for some reason i just cant help but think Guns n' Roses!! why?...slash. his guitar work hasn't really changed, for example..""fall to pieces"" will just take you back to ""sweet child o' mine"". its not that you will get the two bands mixed up..its just the music sounds a little like gnr..but yet again its slash and thats his trademark sound so its ok. wonder what they will bring to the table on their next record??"
5,Velvet Revolver Rocks!!,"This CD is amazing, I picked it up the day it went on sale, and driving along leaving the store I was hooked right away. Now, after listening to it almost daily, it's still in the CD changer. I've recomended the disc to all sorts of people with varied musical tastes and they all find something they really dig on it. The band just plain rocks, and the vocals go from rockin to depths you can't help but feel from one track to the next.What's going on here? This is a place to post your opinions about -THIS CD- not debate one band against another, or whine about Guns 'n Roses or STP. I sincerely hope Amazon deletes the stupid one star ratings because some clown can't ""rip"" the CD. BTW, it only takes a single working brain cell to get past the protection they put on the disc anyway. But, why bootleg it? This CD is worth the price twice over compared to some of the dissapointments I've purchased over the years. Give them some respect eh?"
5,Bypass the Copyright stuff for ripping to MP3,"I don't know how many of you guys have the same problem as i did. But i own an Ipod and i Don't download music illeagally, i just rip all my CD's into MP3(at 320 kb/s). so before i bought the cd i read that you couldn't rip it except with their stupid software at low quality. so i thought whatever, i guess i can deal with that, but then i got it and tried it and they were in .WMA format, which as you know doesn't run on the Ipod. I was distruaght, i loved the cd but couldn't listen to it on my Ipod. but then to my great surprise i found a great website that says exactly how to rip it anyway, so here it is for all you Ipod owners. (...)so go there and do what they say and it works great. by the way the CD is totally awesome, i like almost every song."
4,Not Another Superband!,I saw these guys live a week or two back and they were amazing. Pure Rock And Roll!!! The album is solid to....not like this Audioslave superband crap. Slash is brilliant. Need I say more. Buy it!
5,Tremendous,"If you want an album that rocks, and rocks hard, go out and buy Contraband this instant. It is wonderful, hearkening back on the days when rock was dangerous and beautiful at the same time. Compared to the popular nu-metal and punk bands today, it is a gem to be treasured forever. Compared to the real music of yesteryears, it is a classic that will stand the test of time. But I'm rambling. If you want serious attitude, great guitar licks, and a true frontman, get into the action of Contraband"
1,Stopped me from purchasing,I've heard a few Velvet Revolver songs I liked. But I will live without them them because I don't need the computer hassels. Look. I get it. I'm a songwriter too. I have no problem paying for art. But this is like driving a thumbtack with a sledgehammer.
5,Thank God For Velvet Revolver,Music needed a band like this. The album is the best that i have heard in a long time. I'm really just happy to have another album with Slash playing guitar. If you dont have this album you should pick it up
2,COMPLETELY.... UTTERLY...... MEDIOCRE,"That's all this is. Not horrible, but only slightly above average at it's best (Big Machine). There's no real catchy hooks. The lyrics aren't up to par with what Axl Rose could've written. It's just as mediocre as any of their solo efforts, the only difference is they have name value this time. Utterly, totally, completely, purely............. adequate. I think this is proof positive that they need Axl Rose more than he needs them."
3,OK . Supergroup or Rehashed Group,"Ok. Velvet Revolver boasts a supergroup lineup. Automatically expectations were high considering the lineup and their past history.Lets cut to the chase. If you have lived on a diet of GNR and STP, this is a rehashed meal. The riffs, vocals, drumming all sound like meal leftoversWhile all the tracks are hard hitting, I can't name anything thats outstanding.But one thing's for sure, Slash, Scott, Dave, Duff and Matt can still quite belt it out.Maybe its time for a covers only album.Let me rate it a 3, purely for Slash and Scott Weiland"
4,A great album with bad production on purpose!,"This is a solid attempt by some aging rockers to still kick some ass. Really my review is a 3 1/2, but whatever. I understand that the production of this album is bad. During an interview, Slash explained that the production was done in a way that would replicate their live sound, a raw, raunchy kick in the derriere kind of sound. Wheather you like it or not, its up to you. My favorites on the album are as most, the hits ""fall to pieces"" and ""slither"". These songs show off some of the prior beauty these guys had back in the glory days of GNR and STP. These two songs in my opinion make the album worth owning. They're that good. The rest of the album is only average with some minor glimpses at genious. Overall, this is a solid effort and I would expect this group of fine talent to develop nicely within the next couple albums."
1,"Ugh, didn't we do this already?","Ok, so Scott Weiland has this band, right? And they play very distinctive rock music that catches peoples ears and makes them think and...err, what? You mean this *Isn't* Stone Temple Pilots?!No wonder I thought it sounded worse.Ugh."
1,#@$holes,If you have a minidisc don't buy this cd. Download it from the Sony connect website. I have this cd any will not record correctly with the sony software.
3,Rock 'n' Roll is coming back... but not today.,"I'll give these guys credit - it seems that they put some effort into this album. However, I agree with all the negative points other reviewers mentioned:1.) Are you sure Slash played on this album?2.) The sound IS flat... I didn't know what other reviewers meant by that until I listened to the album.3.) If you are desperately waiting for comeback of the sound, energy and drive of the 80's-early 90's rock, this album isn't it. I know that there are people that will call anything recorded by their old idols ""the best album ever"", but for the average fan this will be sub-par. I do think that STP fans will like this better then GnR fans.4.) One last thing. Those of you who are having trouble ""backing up"" your CD, here's the directions:a.) If your PC is fairly new - sell it on Ebay ASAP.b.) If it isn't - give it to your grandma, maybe she'll learn to use it efficiently."
1,One of the Worst,"I really wanted to like this but I just don't. I've tried to 'let it grow on me' but nothing saves this CD. There are two good songs (not great):'Slither' and 'Do it for the kids' (Has catchy chorus melody)The rest are bad and one is simply one of the worst rock songs ever recorded: 'Fall to Pieces'This album will be seen a lot in the used CD areas of your local stores, so if you HAVE to try it out, get it there for $1 and at least you'll only have waisted one dollar and an hour of your life.If you can, do one better and skip this all together."
1,If I can't rip a CD that is mine....,"...then I don't buy that CD in the first place. I was a huge G'n'R fan, but I won't give these rich whining musicans the time of day nor my hard earned dollar."
2,Overblown overhyped,You would think the the history of the artists combining for this CD would mean something new and exciting. NOT! Same old tired routines that these artists have been selling the braindead fans for the last few years. They aren't concerned with making people think with new and different sounds. They are concerned with selling to people that have no imagination!
2,Uninspired Bastard Child of STP,"This album is uninspired and boring. Somehow they took 3/4 GnR and 1/4 STP and got 4/4 STP minus anything innovative or good. The album is full of muddled songs with boring, dispassionate vocals and tired guitar riffs. The only STP edgeyness that comes out is in 'Slither', which can be written off as on STP parody. Where is the GnR? I don't know - I guess those 3 had nothing to with GnR's song writing because none of it is seen in this album. The only times I enjoyed this album was when Weiland sang his typical monotone vocal riffs ala Jim Morrison. The album is worth a listen but not worth a buy."
4,Very nice yarn,"I am using it for pom poms, so this yarn was the perfect weight. It isn't super soft, so keep that in mind if you are using it for a baby blanket."
5,Awsome Splatter-Fun!,"This is a great movie if you love gore FX. It is a little slow with the backstory early on, but when the night scenes come the sh;t hits the fan! Everybody's getting possesed, tearing each other apart, and trying to survive till morning comes.All the actors were fun to watch, with all the stuff that was done to them in the story. The extras on the DVD are cool. The behind the scenes video especially. These guys are real grass-roots horror fans. Awesome bloody FX!!"
2,Eric's best. though his last,"This film may not be technically better than other Stanze films, however it does have the strength of innocence and effort. You can tell that they tried hard for this film, even Stanze.The plot is a decent, though underwritten one. It has the strength of originality, in the concept, not necessarily the story. The gore is decently done for a no-budget film. Makeup was terrible. Actors gave it their all, even if it wasn't enough.Since this is a directors debut, errors are forgivable."
1,Stay away from savage harvest!,"The only part of this movie that was even worth watching was the shotgun blast to the head scene.The meltdown part was only alright.If you want to see the only true gore film,in my book it's Peter Jackson's Dead Alive.Savage Harvest looks just plain pittiful next to that.Or even Bad Taste(also by Peter Jackson.)Besides the gore this movie had extra terrible acting.Not cheesy.Cheesy can actually be fun.(Note,Dead Alive.)And also I say they should've saved up some more money for a better camera,and lighting,and ACTING CLASSES! With only a slightly below average story,all it really lacked was some originality and creativity.Duh look over there behind those boxes.Oh dear,look,it's a scary demon.Oh look a screwdriver.I'll jam it in it's forehead.Oh look i did.If your gonna do something do it well WATCH PETER JACKSON MOVIES.GET CREATIVE!The real score is zero stars."
1,Hard Back not Paper Back,This is the second time I have purchased a book that said hard back book and recieved something I did not order. Other than that the service is fair.
4,Apocrypha,"I purchased a copy of the Apocrypha as a source of reference for Bible study, primarily because the Apocrypha contains historical information about the Jewish war with Antiochus. Jesus and his disciples celebrated the victory of their people with a festival, better known today as Hanukah. There is an addition to the book of Esther as well. Some of the books are inspirational ficiton. It's an interesting read, though I'm not quite sure what to make of some parts of it. Each book has an informative introduction which is quite helpful if you are not very familiar with the books of the Apocrypha."
4,"maybe, maybe not","Althought this is not considered part of Scripture in the modern Bible any longer, I still have truly enjoyed reading this. I found this to be easy to read. Whenever a person reads positive material that is praising our Lord, then they will be gaining knowledge of some sort. Subjects will arise that will peak curiousities and cause that curious nature to seek out more answers or more information on certain subjects. Seeking the Lord and furthering your knowledge of Him, is most wonderful and blessed. So, whether you read this, a devotional, or ? do it with the mind set, that you are learning and seeking. Pray for guidance and He will take care of the rest."
1,Thanks for enlightening me!,I almost bought this book thinking it was about something totally different! If you're like me and are looking for a diverse series (multi-cultural) I enjoyed the (Baby Faces) books by Roberta Grobel Intrater.
3,Not what I was looking for...,"I wanted this trivia to play with the family or with a few friends. I like NTN Buzztime, but read the many negative reviews of the home system. I opted for this and the Pop Culture DVD, and I'm not pleased. It is low quality and simple. Some of the questions are way too easy (great for the little ones) and not very challenging for adults. There is no way to select answers, it just slowly removes the incorrect ones. Moves too slow for family and friend gatherings - only good for a party where there is alot going on. Wouldn't recommend unless you are looking for low budget entertainment at a party."
5,One of the Best,"I had read Jefferies' nature writing and loved it. But this is one of the best books about an inner life ever written. He makes some leaps that no one else has, and I've read a lot."
4,oldie but goodie,"if you're over 60 you'll remember this ""chick flick"". Although dated, it's still a good movie and I enjoyed watching again!"
4,Hawaii Past,"Great scenes of Hawaii some years ago. Gave it to my brother, who lives on Oahu, and we watched it last time we were there. Presents an interesting view of multicultural relationships."
5,Nice!,"I love movies set in Hawaii, never heard of this movie till I started my search for more movies, it was a really good find!"
5,Diamond Head,I've been looking for this movie for years. Till I found Amazon I could not find it. The price was great. I love this movie.
4,"Good character study, held my interest through till the end","Good cast, fine performances, beautiful cinematography. A little long, but worth it. I found it very entertaining and would enjoy watching it over and over again."
2,Not the best.,I got this movie because James Darren was in it. He was good as was France Nguyen. They play the only likeable characters in the main cast and neither makes it through the whole movie. Of course I knew that when I bought it.
3,Awesome but...,The book was great and the shipping was on time BUT they had this huge sticker on the table of contents. I informed them and the said they can refune my money but they can not give me another book because it was out of stock. SO just double check your pages to make sure they dont place stickers on important pages...and check if they have a couple extra copies just in case this happens to you.
3,Color is off,"The seamless roll is nice quality. It was really, really difficult to get the paper mailing tube open. (I ended up using the end of an electric screwdriver to release the plastic end cap.I'm a bit disappointed with the color --- this is definitely a purple gray. That isn't reflected in the sample swatch."
2,Disappointed!,"I have been looking for gold shoes and I found these. I was disappointed in them! I thought they would have more sparkle than they really do. Needed them for a wedding, but never got a chance to wear them because they came to late. I decided to keep them anyways...was still bummed about them!"
2,INTRO to STATISTICS,"This book has little about using SPSS (the very basics). It has much, much more about simple statistics. I bought the book to learn SPSS, not statistics. If you are looking for a book on how to use SPSS, I recommend you look elsewhere."
1,Ugliest music video,One should not expect too much from home-made video. However this one is just terrible! Not recommended.
1,"No, just no.","What I thought I was ordering was going to be a few scenes of hot steamy girls spinning. Girl Dj's and maybe their best tracks or best gigs. Somehow I must of completely misread the description. What I got was just bad, ugly Girls gone Wild and not even to techno."
4,Good guide but some real flaws,"Bill Mann has obviously done his homework on this book. Good photos, clear directions and easy to follow instructions. Contains some fluff commentary but overall well written. Be advised that at this review, the information is over six years old and some of the sites may have changed due to people abusing their environment. Update 10/2007 - discovered that many of the GPS waypoints in the book are wildly inaccurate, in one case by over 1/4 mile. No, my GPS is not malfunctioning (verified coordinates with topo maps). I suspect that the writers attempted to estimate the GPS coordinates rather than actually marked them physically. This was very frustrating on our last excursion. Because of this, I have to down grade my previous rating to only two stars."
2,Robuster,For the money not a good buy.The book is old and can be bought at any used book store for a quarter.I love everything he has wrote and bought this book when it came out.It started me on the Burke bandwagon.Good book but way over priced.Save your hard earned money and buy USED.
4,"Great story, a harbinger of more great Texas tales","I read Two For Texas after having read another Billy Bob Holland novel, and the strengths of Billy Bob are evident when you read this tale of his great-grandfather. The setting in Western Louisianna and East Texas is right in the center of James Lee Burke's other works, and he doesn't stray too far from the areas his readers have become familiar with. This is a lively and entertaining story that leads into the territory and psyche of Burke's later character, Billy Bob Holland."
4,Two for Texas,"This is another great James Lee Burke novel. There is alot of Texas history in the story. And as always James Lee Burkes writing style makes the story very realistic. In this book a story is told of two guys who are running from the law in Louisiana and head for Texas. They are looking for and find Sam Houston just before the battle for Texas independence. The story is told as only James Lee Burke can tell it. Fast reading and holds your interest. If you like James Lee Burke, you like Two for Texas."
2,Disappointing,I usually love all of James Lee Burke's books. This one was a disappointment. Perhaps because I did not read it until after I had read the last five years books?
3,TWO FOR TEXAS,"TWO FOR TEXASNot one of his best novels, but if you do not have anything else to read it is okay.mulesmyles"
3,A History of the Evolution of the Sport,very interesting and information for a newcomer to the sport.
1,The worst movie I have watched in my entire life!,What the hell?? From the description it sounded like a good movie! In reality its got to be the worst movie ever!! I couldn't even hardly sit through it! The acting sucked. The Story Sucked. The Plot Sucked... Ooops I am sorry I made a mistake THERE WAS NO PLOT!! I wish I never would have watched it! Unless you want to see flashbacks of the main charectors mom giving herself and aportion with a coat hanger then I don't recomend this movie for anyone. It would have been alot better if daryl hanah's charector died in the end. At least then maybe you would get some sense of satisfaction out of watching it.....I am the only person I know that has atempted to watch this film and actualy sat through the whole thing. I thought 'well maybe it will make sense if i watch some more' I was wrong..... You would have to pay me at least $50 to sit through it again!
4,Wicca With A Celtic Touch,"Although I do not feel that this book was written from a very historically correct standpoint, overall I enjoyed the information contained within. If you're looking for information on incoporating some Celtic knowledge/influence into your path, then I would suggest it. There are some wonderful meditations in this book. However if you're looking for history I'd suggest you try a different book."
1,A Little Reality,"Folks, being Celtic is a matter of genes and heritage. You cannot become a ""Celtic Woman"" simply by performing the rites offered in this book. Sure, there's a paradigm associated with the Celts (which is such a broad term anyway since you're talking about various different peoples), and I suppose anyone could adapt them. But being Celtic is a question of having Celtic blood, and neither this book nor any other can give you that. I really feel like this book cheapens my own Celtic heritage at the same time it insults other heritages by somehow implying there's something more to being Celtic. I would love to see a book extolling a heritage other than Celtic just to run against the pop Celtic interest grain. Shame!"
3,"New Age ""Celtic"" Fluff","She's a good author for those who want to take a teeny side step from the Wiccan tradition, without fully departing from Wicca. All of her works have a firm foundation in Wicca and this book is no exception."
4,pretty decent,"I'd ordered this back on one of my deployments for something to read. Its pretty good - I enjoyed the historical aspects, but didn't have much used for the rituals as they were mainly geared towards 2 or more people. I think I'm probably still looking for more solid history, less ritual practice. But, all in all, it was a good book and will probably cover what most folk are looking for."
4,Great Celtic Magic Title!,"The genre of Celtic studies is new to me. I've looked at several titles but I have to say Edain McCoy's book of Celtic Women's Spirituality is the one worth you time, money, and shelf space. She has obviously done some grueling research to write this book, and facts are backed up with detailed notes and bibliographies. She explores the cults and clans of Celtic tradition. This book is rich with Celtic and Pagan history, and also has many guided meditations and rituals. What I like most about it was the surprises at the end. If you are in a location where Celtic and magic books aren't readily available, there is a great appendix of sources, magazines, and newsletters. There is also a section of Celtic Folk Tunes sheet music. This is a great gift to yourself, or any friend studying Celtic magic."
5,great quality easy setup/use,"I've had this mortise machine for a little over a year now. It has worked perfectly giving me square true mortises every time. Setup is quite simple and with a few shop made supports drillling mortises in long rails has never been easier. I've only used the 3/8"", 1/4"" and 5/16 chisels to date but none of them faltered. Note: pick up a set of conical honing stones from Lee Valley. Sure makes life with a sharp bit simple! Great prodcuct from Delta. Not quite as fancy as the new replacement but works just as well for a few $$ less."
3,OK for light duty work,"I took a chance and picked up the MM300 for $129 on closeout at one of the Big Box stores. I punched about a dozen 3/8"" holes in some scrap pine - and then tried one 1/2"" hole. Sheared the pin that holds the lever on, right off.Had it repaired, under warranty, and had it back in about 10 days. After that - stuck with 3/8"" bit and did another two dozen holes in some Mahoghany. For the price I paid, I'm OK with it. But if it was the MM300 for $200, then I'd consider the 651.In either case - head on over to Lee Valley and pick up their conical hones to touch up the chisels before you use it."
1,The Great Physician?,"Who is Rubin referring to? Certainly not himself. He's a naturopath (which is fine) but is also accredited by a company that gives one a ""C.N.C"" certificate after answering multiple choice questions and of course sending in their $150. All his books are the same: designed to sell his extremely overpriced and questionable supplements. He's a master marketer, but ceratinly not a Great Physician. And his reputation is fading fast. All one needs to do is look at the Amazon page for his first book ""Patient, Heal Thyself"", where it's selling for just over a dollar..."
5,worth the extra money,We bought this seat for my when she was about 4 months old. She was to tall for infant car seat. Shes now 2 1/2 and still using the seat. It's great! We have no complants at all. Worth the money!
3,shoulder width and machine washability problems,"This item sounded great in the reviews, but we'll have to return this right away because the shoulder width is so narrow - noticeably narrower than in other convertible car seats. My 14-month old daughter (who is always in the 95% for ht. and wt. but doesn't have particularly wide shoulders) fits in it now, but this isn't going to fit her all the way till age 4 when she moves to a booster. For this price, I don't want to be replacing this in a year. Apparently the Britax Marathon is supposed to be wider in the shoulder, and supposed to fit up to 65 lbs, but Amazon doesn't carry this item.Another problem - all these Britax car seat covers (according to the Britax web site) aren't supposed to be machine washed, just hand washed, and frankly, if my child throws up/leaks/spills in the car seat and it needs washing, I don't particularly want to be doing that by hand, especially at this price."
1,Don't Buy Britax,"Although others have reviewed Britax seats and given them high ratings, I would tell you not to buy Britax. We have the Roundabout carseat and it's been popping out of the lock-offs no matter which car we've tried it in. This causes the seat to move quite a bit since the lock-offs are supposed to keep the tight seatbelt in place. When I contacted Britax, they sent new lock-offs for us to install, but that didn't fix the problem. When I called again to tell them our seat isn't safe and needs to be replaced, they told me they couldn't do anything for me. After spending $200 on a car seat to keep our precious cargo safe, you'd think they'd be willing to replace it. Do not buy from Britax -- they won't help you if you have a problem with your seat. It's the most disappointing customer service I've ever received."
4,"Easier, Better, Safer","At first I wasn't sure how to thread the belt for the forward facing position. Once I figured that out, installation was a breeze. My daughter was very comfortable, and I loved the security of the five point harness. The harness can be put on by pulling from the sides instead of over the head which is a big plus.I also tried the seat in the rear facing position but for some reason, in my vehicle (Dodge Grand Caravan) it seemed wobbly in that position. This may be correctable with one of the seat pad accessories but I have not tried this since my daughter is big enough to face forward.B MorrisonWilmington, NC"
4,Good Quality,I bought this as a second car seat my main one is the boulevard..I think it's a well put together seat but I wish it had the side impact protection like the boulevard. also I bought this seat and realized that the weight limit was like 40 and the boulevard is 65 so I should have spent the extra money and got another boulevard because I am going to have to buy another seat anyway once she reached 40 pounds! My baby seems to like it though as far as being a comfortable seat..the only other thing I don't like is that her head slumps over sometimes when she falls asleep.
5,LOVE IT LOVE IT... JUST BUY IT!!!!!,"AFter trying several car seats for my 20 lbs 4 month old this was the best!!! He fit in very nice, it installed easily and proper. the belts do not twist and it secures tightly around his shoulders. Very user friendly. Do not even bother with another car seat this is the one for any baby!!!!"
5,"So good, I bought two",Very nice car seat. Easy to install and very secure. Fabric cover is easy to remove and clean.
2,lock-offs seem flimsy,"I bought the britax because in my opinion, you can't put a price on safety! However, the easy forward facing lock-offs seem poorly made, When I went to buckle my son in today, the lock-off was released. Now I can't seem to get it tight no matter what. I had a similar problem with the Britax Marathon, but after exchanging it, it has been fine. I guess I'm off to try another roundabout as well :("
3,A turning point in modern French history,Horne does a thorough job on the post-Indo China turmoil of French politics over Algeria. Good pictures are drawn of the principal players including De Gaulle. The pressure French institutions were put under is strikingly illustrated. Throughout this the French Army held together (just).
4,A Look at French Counter-Insurgency,"A combat veteran of World War II, a world-class journalist, and a lifelong student of French history, Alistair Horne is well equipped to tell the tale of the Algerian war of independence. Professional warriors and historians should read this book because it portrays the same forces that were at work in Vietnam in a completely different environment. It's all here--a tightly organized group willing to stop at nothing to gain power, tradition-bound villagers enlisted in the cause of a left-wing revolution, a hopelessly divided Western nation trying to live up to its commitments, Western-educated intellectuals attacking the West, Westernized elites caught in the middle of a civil war, and ethnic minorities left out in the cold when power is handed over to the ""natives,"" not to mention pacification, ""hearts and minds,"" terrorism, and ""search and destroy."""
5,War of Independence,"Alistair Horne's account of the Algerian war of independence is the finest I have read in the English language. He successfully captured the roles played by the French ""colons"" and their French military supporters, the Algerian natives, the French government, and the Algerian leaders. Horne makes key actors in this real life drama come alive. This work is valuable in understanding the Algeria of today."
4,Great context on Algerian conflict,"As the jacket indicates, this book carries a high degree of relevance for anyone interested in the conflict in Iraq. Horne's work is impressive. There are some uncomfortable timeline adjustments moving from chapter to chapter and there is also a very wide array of personalities involved. As Horne concedes early in the book, his narrative is more full and accurate on the French side than the Algerian. But overall, the context is quite good."
5,a classic,"As one ponders the `insurgency' in Iraq, one wonders if the administration had any idea what they were getting into. If they had read this work, they may have at least prepared for what has occurred since March 2003.Highly recommended."
5,A Tour De Force,"Wow..history as it should be written. A gripping analysis of humans caught in a maelstrom of myriad forces, colonial, religious, cultural, historical. Not many heroes here but really not many villains either. Unless you want to include everyone as a villain. The atrocities are appalling and heartbreaking but Horne is remarkably even-handed and his level of detail and insight into especially the French mentality is superb. To say I know what a pied-noir might actually have been thinking back then is a long stretch but at least I have SOME understanding of the forces that led to the tragedy of Algeria. That said I am not sure that Algeria has many parallels applicable to the Iraq conflict of today. Other than that war sucks and civil-war might suck worse."
5,Brilliant examination of an often forgotten episode of history,"I picked up this book knowing next to nothing about the franco-algerian war and after reading it i felt i knew a great deal about it. Alastair Horne is an excellent writer who manages to be both highly detailed and informative at the same time as telling a great story. It's hard to decide which part of the story he told best, the passages regarding the guerilla war in the mountains of Algeria was fascinating but the way he told about the end of french algeria and the exile of the european population of algeria was heartbreaking at times. This is one of the best history books i've read in a long time and on the basis of it i intend to read everything Horne has written, if it is even half as good as this it will be worth the read. I would recommend this book to everyone who enjoys good history well told."
1,Waste of money,"This book is not very useful, since it introduces the script's characters but contains only a minimum of texts to exercise them. For those who already know Chinese script, the chapters about Kanji are absolutely not interesting, and for those who have never seen a Kanji before, it is almost equally useless with all the effort to present everything in nice pictures. Advanced learners will find that linking characters to pictures is an absolutely ridiculous method once you want to learn a few thousands of them. Furthermore, I expected that this book would in some way relate to the volume ""Teach yourself Japanese"", but that is not the case.Everyone who really wants to learn Japanese, better find something else."
3,pretty,The picture is very pretty. But you could get a much better towel at JC Penney's for about the same money. It is thin and low quality.
3,"Outstanding storytelling, threadbare story","I have to hand it Charles Sheffield; he has created a page turner of a story with almost no real story. This book gets by on it's characters, the best one being Bat. I kept waiting for the story to get to where I hoped it was going and it never did."
5,Very Interesting piece of SF with a little mystery.,"This was a very good book, with a great plot, no matter what that dude above me says. It twists and turns and involves several very interesting and unique characters, with a good satisfying end."
4,"Easy read. Bit of detective novel, bit of hard sf.","For some reason the publishers like comparing this author with Asimov and Clark. Surely by the late 90s this puts off more people than it encourages. I can see similarity with Asimov in that there are central characters engaged in a bit of detective work and its mostly a battle of brains rather than brawn. Thankfully it doesn't have 95 pages of dialogue where you are supposed to spot the clue. Anyway... this book is fun to read. He's taken the same universe as the Ganymede Club and selected the one of the same characters, but not the one you might expect... Bat. Mostly set in space, or underwater, or under planets .. good escapist stuff"
4,My First Introduction to Charles Sheffield : Enjoy It,"""Cold as Ice"" was my introduction to Charles Sheffield. It is a very enjoyable book and an excellent introduction to Sheffield's style of Hard Science Fiction. One of the character in the book, ""Bat"", is one of my favorite characters of all times and definitely an archtype of note for me, at least. The plot moves and reads well. It is not overly complex or deep. It is clean and efficient prose. If you want to check out Charles Sheffield as an author, ""Cold as Ice"" is a great place to start."
2,"No Herons, ducks or anything other than Sandpiper-like birds...","I was thinking this book would cover everything that you would typically find near salt water and marshes, like Herons, Ducks, Widgeons, Loons, Geese, Gulls, etc. It only covers a very narrow range of sandpiper, plover and stints.However, if that is what you want, this appears to be a very nice book with a heavy-duty cover."
5,A Good Example of TeX Writing,"Since Spivak macros have been ported to LaTeX (the AMS LaTeX collection), people rarely use AMSTeX. Therefore this book ceased to be important as a primary textbook or a reference. Nevertheless it would be a shame for it to become forgotten. Written with typical Spivak's subtle humor (the book gently mocks both The Joy of Cooking and The Joy of Sex), it introduces important concepts of TeX and mathematical typesetting. It is one of the rare books that explain not just HOW, but also WHY. It would be enjoyable both for a TeX gourmet and a technical writer interested in the way Spivak is able to explain difficult things in simple terms."
4,Danner boots,Very good boots. The only thing this boot needs is a side zipper it is a real pain lacing them up every time you put them on and take them off.
3,Just a List,"This is not a horrible book, but its not a great book either. The book looks and feels like the publisher had some cost constraints he put himself under.Pros: 1. There were some hikes under here that I would not have though of. 2. The maps, with one major exception ( which is listed in my list of cons ) seems to be pretty professionally done. There was nothing hand scribbled here.Cons: 1. Maps - there is a little compass on each that shows where North is pointing. Sometimes north is pointed up, but a lot of times it isn't. This one of the items that says the publisher was cutting costs, and it really shows 2. There was nothing in the different hike descriptions that got me excited about that hike. 3. No pictures - another case of the publisher cutting costs."
2,Not Bad,"as a dixie chicks fan I found the music to be sub-par. The audio itself was good, mThe tape was in excelent condition. By listening to this taper I cam understand why Natalie was brought in."
1,Not work with side installation,"definitely not working with side installation, and by the time you ""adjust"" the arm and think this will work, you already destroy it to the point that no refund possible. So unless you are doing the front installation, not worth it at all."
5,Very pleased with this item,"This is a great product. Easy to install, and functions nicely. I've found that there are two variations of ""oil-rubbed bronze,"" with one having copperish highlights and others a solid dark bronze/brown color. These are the solid dark color. I bought some faucets for the bathroom, which are the highlighted type (link below), but the shape of this lever blends nicely. I think my toilet paper holder is a Liberty brand from Bed Bath and Beyond, and these match perfectly. This also doesn't hit the toilet lid on my toilet, and sits horizontal.Hardware House 12-2269 2-Handle Lavatory Faucet, Oil Rubbed Bronze"
2,Nice looking but not working well for me,"The handle is nice looking, but the metal on the inside has bent already and made the handle useless. Looks good, but lacks functionality."
3,Will Not Work for a Side Mount,"Five stars for quality gives way to three stars for what some would call false advertising.This product is substantial and *seemingly* well-crafted. (Other reviews have claimed that it's not solid brass, but merely brass-plated. It wouldn't surprise me at this price point.) At any rate, despite the manufacture's claims, this lever will not work well in the side-mounted position. It *can* be made to operate the flapper valve, but only if it's installed such that the lever must be lifted rather than depressed in order to initiate a flush. Obviously, this is counter to how flush levers operate. Also, in its free state the lever hangs at an angle rather than sitting horizontally. No good. I plan to return this product and try to order one that is made specifically for the side-mount configuration. I would not hesitate to purchase this lever again, though, if I needed to install it as a front-mount."
2,Oil Brushed Bronze Toilet Lever,"Although the lever's design is very much like the faucet handles on my new Victorian bathroom vanity, I do not like the way it flushes. The hardware with it is not nearly as nice as ones I have purchased previously."
4,Great Product,We received our lever 2 weeks ago. I just installed it. The quality and ease of installation was good. I would definetly recommend this product.
2,Confusing and not for side flushers!,"It looks very pretty and is heavy, but it doesn't fit the side flusher toilets as it claims to. Also awkward directions and set up."
4,A worthy and stylish replacement handle,"This was easy to install, but the nut holding the arm that raises the flapper valve chain occasionally loosened, resulting in diminished flush performance. Some thread sealer would remedy this."
1,side mount false,It does not and can not work on side mount plus the instructions ramble on without any clarity. They are pointless for any installation as if a bunch of words about the lever equate to instructions. Very disappointing and certainly not worth twice the money over std levers. I only bought it due to the side mount claims which are completely false.
2,Not recommended for side tank mount,"Good quality, but I could not get the handle to work for mounting on the side of the tank. It would not lift the flap high enough to get sufficient water flow. I'm sure it would work fine for a front lever install, but it is definitely not a universal mount like the product claims."
2,Wouldn't buy this again,"The previous owners of our home replaced the toilet levers (along with faucets) in all of the bathrooms. Of the 3 toilets we have, 2 of these levers have broken.Yes, they're very attractive levers and quite reasonably priced but when you have to replace them, the price no longer factors into the equation.Do yourself a favor, buy a Moen or some other brand that offers a lifetime warranty as toilet levers aren't something that should just snap in half!"
2,Pieced or Appliqued Flowers,This book is a compilation of 7 quilt designers work. Each designer created a quilt using piecing techniques to create the look of flowers. There maybe additional appliqued flowers with the pieced design but not always. I feel there are better books on quilt pieced designs and applique designs than this one although all these designs were unique. I would not recommend this book.
2,Pieced or Appliqued Flowers From the AQS Contest,The book is a compilation of 7 quilt designers flower quilts. These quilts were pieced with some having applique added. The designs are all unique but there are better books on quilting designs and applique. I would not recommend this book.
4,well made and a good value,"I found the Delta TP300 planer very easy to use.My friend had one and I was familiar with the product.I looked at many other (slightly more expensive) planers available.But decided to go with this planer and order it on Amazon.com.It was delivered fast and set up easy right out of the box.The instructions were good and as far a power tools go, it was very easy to adjust and use.But most important, it did an excellent job planing rough stock wood.The surface came out great!And after some infeed/outfeed adjusting, I got very little snipe on the ends.I think this is a product that really delivers."
5,tp 300 planer,light weight portable planers with power. Easiest one I've ever had to change blades on (only takes about 10 minutes)nice feed rate and no chatter.
1,Same as Tayama Air Cooler TC-998-BAD!,"This unit is the same as the Tayama Air Cooler TC-998 and works as poorly.Only after filling the entire tray with ice and water chilled overnight does this thing have any cooling effect and even than, it's only for an hour or so.Anything less then ice and ice water will do nothing more than generate humidity and waste power.Save your money and buy a real AC unit for supplemental cooling."
1,leaks like a seeve,"bought this product from a vietnamese supermarket for the same price as offered here. used the evaporative function for about a week, then it started leaking. Took it apart found no cracks in the water tray, also tightened up the drain plug with teflon tape, still leaked. put a ring of plumbers putty where drain hole in water tray meets the frame and reseated the water tray. Did not leak for about an hour, so I left for work, came back home after a few hours, the towels I placed around the bottom on the unit was soaked, leaked again. Cannot return it as I've thrown the box and reciept away. The fan function is powerful and works good not sure about how good the ionizer works, but it is always on. Once the unit dries off, I will just use the fan function. Unit is also very light and is attractive, too bad it leaks, will not get another one."
1,Really? You're kidding right?,I purchased this expecting to make the room slightly cooler at the very least I expected it to work as described.However it doesn't make the room any cooler than a low powered fan using the lowest settings. I did everything as instructed and even bought a bag of ice to put in the water tray and still... not much cooler if cooler at all really than a low powered fan you can buy for $10 I can't recommend that ANYONE for ANY reason EVER buy this product.
4,Great for Supplemental Cooling,"My boyfriend has this unit, and it performs so well that I ordered one for myself. It's great in the master bedroom on the hotter/west side of this house. I have central A/C and overhead fans, but we've had 33 straight days where the outside temperature has been at or over 100 degrees here in Texas, so I need all the supplemental cooling I can get. This evaporative air-cooler fits the bill. NO leaks! I like the fact that the unit has casters so we can roll it into whatever room we're in. Ice-water added to the reservoir helps the outgoing air feel a bit cooler, and the ionizer is an added plus. I would give it 5 stars, but the remote control seems rather cheaply made and the water-level indicator is difficult to see/read--- which might be why some folks have had problems with leakage. This unit isn't designed to cool your whole house, but it will sure make the room that it is in much more comfortable during the dog days of summer."
2,Not even close to what I expected,"This product was not what I expected. I realized that this was not going to have the cooling power of an A/C, but I at least expected it to be a little bit cooling. This is pretty much a bigger more expensive fan. I filled the unit with water, ice and the ice packs included and I never felt the air coming from it any cooler. Unfortunately, the store I purchased it from does not take returns on coolers and I would have to return it to the manufacturer. I would have to pay return shipping fees and the manufacturer charges a 15% restocking fee...not worth it. So, looks like I'm stuck with it and now $100 short because of it. I just use it as a fan now, at least it works for that. I suggest you save your money up and buy a portable A/C instead. It will be a better investment."
2,air cooler,This model is not as good as model 611. It is only good for a small small room. The model 611 was a much better cooling unit.
1,A piece of junk,"The remote worked well but that was about it. It did not put out any cool air. I've since purchased a Ultracool with the same capacity (water and BTU reduction) and it works very well. It keeps my entire 29' Fifth wheel at very livable temps. For instance, yesterday the hottest temp was at 4 pm (99 degrees) and that was the first time I turned on the AC. Had been using the evaporative (swamp) cooler all day long. Only used the AC (1,500 watts) for 3 hours yesterday and 8 hours of 60 watt evaporative cooler. That's a substantial savings. I expect this $180 swamper to recoup its cost this summer alone. Next year will be all pure savings."
4,it does the job...,"It does what it needs it to do, can't complain. I put Ice cubes w/ the water for cooler air."
1,crappy item,this is a very cheaply made and doesn't work as advertised.The only thing I found helpful was the return process.
1,worst product ever,"I bought 2 units, and now they are sitting in the basement, do not waste you money."
1,Waste of Money,"This is nothing but an expensive fan. Even though I've put a lot ice into it, it is not strong enough to even drop the room temperature down to at least 10 degrees. Returned it the next day. Invest on a energy efficient A/C instead."
4,cooler that really cools,"I purchased this portable evaporative cooler for my son who lives in a small home, and doesn't have central cooling. He is so happy with it! He puts ice and water in the container, and it runs all day. He says it actually gets cold. I'm glad I found it on Amazon!"
1,expensive fan! Doesn't work,"Don't waste your money, buy a $20 fan instead. Does the same thing as a box fan. Doesn't even cool a 6'x 8' room."
3,dont be overcharged,You can get the delta dp 200 10 inch drill press for $88 at lowes. Not $119.99 at Amazon.com.(is your shipping free?)Made me wonder what else I may have been overcharged for.
5,Great Drill Press,"I re-did my entire kitchen and needed a drill press in order to drill the holes for my resessed hinges. This drill ate right through solid/hardwood maple cabinets like a hot knife going through butter. I took the top off, adjusted the speed, and drilled beatiful holes. Set up was a snap, I was done in less than 15 minutes. And changing speeds by moving the belts is a 2 minute job, start to finish. This drill is very smooth and I know from putting it together that it will last me a lifetime. A quality product from Delta."
2,a defective machine,"amazon has been helpful. that's about all i can say about this item.i received it and the case was cracked in transport. amazon and i settled that and then less than 3 weeks after receiving the drill press it broke. the tension spring snapped while i was drilling 2 inch deep holes into Douglas Fir. So now i'm returning it for, hopefully, a full refund.otherwise, the delta was easy to set up and seemed sturdy enough. however, i probably won't buy another delta again because of all the problems i've had with this supposed workhorse."
2,Motor burnt out,"After 2 years of light and I mean extremely light usage, the motor burnt out right after the warranty expired. It was an ok press while it lasted but don't expect much from it and don't be surprised that it doesn't last."
5,Great for what it does..,"Great price, quick delivery. I hadn't had much pressing to do with it, but what I was able to do, it did it great with the precision I needed. Highly recommended if you need to drill a lot of holes with accuracy and day to day precision."
1,Defective motor,"Easy to put together... excellent for starting up a woodworking shop, but plugged it in the second day and the motor just hummed and wouldn't turn (it worked the day before for boring a 2 inch hole with a hole saw.When I took the motor cover off, and removed the belt, the motor would work with a spin of the hand helping it along. But if the motor slowed too much, it would simply hum and turn at 1/4 speed.My conclusion is that this was manufactured with a defective motor. Not too good publicity for the Delta brand name.I'll have to return it to Lowe's, but I'm not confident that the next one will work either. If the one I exchange it for works OK, I'll wite another review but I wanted to let you know about this."
4,I like this,"This CD is really good, I love the singers voice and the guitar work. The singer kind of reminds me of Cedric from ATDI and TMV, even looks like him a little. The only thing that I dont like about this CD is how the last song has over 30 minutes of the same noise, thats just a waste of disc space, they couldve done something more creative there, at least something listenable. Fav. song: THe Last American Cowboy."
5,Brace Yourself...,"I dont see how anyone can give this anything less than 4 stars. I've seen these guys twice live, and let me tell you they kickass. Every song is awesome, just overall one of my favorite albums. I recommend Last American Cowboy"
2,WHAT THE F%%K WERE YOU THINKING,This cd is about a joke. No offense to the bled but this cd is about as weak as simple plan. It sounds like another pussy ass emo band with cry baby singing. What the hell happened to the hardcore screams and killer riffs that was on pass the flask. This cd is a dissapointment to all original bled bands.
1,No...Please God No!,"Dissapointing can't begin to describe this CD. It is truly disgusting.I have been listeing to it over and over waiting for it to grow on me as most CDs do, and just as it began to i listened to one song off 'pass the flask' and any hope for the CD that had built up was gone instantly.I was worried that it would not be as hard as the last one but instead they just do some 'purevolme'/'every time i die' crap with no hard screaming at all just crappy post-hardcore middleground trash like 100000000000 other bands. The randomness is gone and replaced with weak chorous/verse/chorous/verse structure and some sh*tty guitar breakdowns.The part that really urks me however is that the lyrics on 'pass the flask' were absolute poetry and here they are emotionless and tired.I dont even know what im trying to to say. Just please please dont waste your money on this album."
4,Why is everyone bitching?,"You're supposed to give GOOD records GOOD reviews...duuuuh. See there is SOME good hardcore that is creative. And now the mountain of imitators comes....agghh, damn u hardcore kidz..."
3,What's everyone whining about?,The band sucked to begin with. The only good song off the original album was The Sound Of Sulfur. Atleast they're trying to be innovative here
2,disappointing,"hi we're the bled and we would like to let all of you fans that waited a long ass time for this cd to come out know that we have decided to throw any originality and credability we had out the window by changing to a major label and throwing in a bunch of forced clean vocals and lame ass choruses, o ya, we'll even put in weak riffs and weak breakdowns for good measure. All you kiddies out there will love it. (The bled's inner thoughts)not even close to pass the flask. im all for change and evolving as a band but this is crap. every song from pass the flask is better than the best song on this cd. forget this crap, stick with pass the flask and then if you're feelin extra special, get out there and get Between the buried and me's new cd ""alaska"" hittin the shelves September 6th. Im pretty sure after listening to it you'll start using ""found in the flood""s cover art to wipe your butt with."
2,Asian Beauty by Margaret Kimura,"I wanted to check this book out at my local book store first before I bought it,thank goodness I did. I thought this book would discuss and show different techniques on how to apply makeup and different looks you can achieve with makeup, but it didn't. It vaguely discuss how Asian features are different, which is nice, but it doesn't discuss on how to play up those features. The pictures and the models in the book were pretty but some of the makeup is a little strange (orange lipstick?). The book claims to have all types of Asian women in the book which it does but it doesn't discuss or show how to apply makeup to different people and the explainations on how to do things were skimpy. This is a nice book to look at while waiting in line someplace, but as for reading and it's usefulness to anyone Asian or not, very little. I think anyone thinking of buying this book should look it over before making any irrational decisions."
2,Asian Beauty,"I have The Asian Face, written at least 20 years ago and was looking for a new, updated book on makeup tips for Asian faces. I called a local bookstore and had it put on hold. Stupidly, I bought it without looking through it. It certainly wasn't what I had expected or wanted. The faces of the models are not pure Asian faces; rather they are Asian blends with beautiful deep-set eyes. The faces in the book hardly need any help.I wanted some tips for every day makeup. Many of the models had makeup on that I wouldn't even wear at night. I am especially interested in makeup for the eyes. I had expected some tips for the various types of Asian eyes (which no magazine ever covers). However, that was not the case. I'm sorry I bought the book. I had planned to buy another one as a gift but will not do so now."
2,"This book should've been titled ""Eur""asian Beauty","Despite it's title, the majority of models featured in this book are half-asian. And although I was initially excited by the fact that there were so many faces similar to mine, it was a useless purchase.I could've picked up an issue of Allure or Glamour and found more useful beauty and makeup tips for a fraction of the price. As for the actual quality of the photos, I was in shock. Some of the images had been so enlarged that I could see the pixelation on some of the models' faces. I've seen newspaper inserts that were of a higher quality.If I was a full Asian woman I would've given ""Asian Beauty"" one star. I saw nothing in this book that deals with the specific issues that many women of Asian descent deal with, ie: single eyelids, rounder faces, etc."
2,"Nice colors, not much else","Initially, I was very excited about this book. I have Making Faces by Kevyn Aucoin, but I wanted another book that would teach me how to use vibrant colors so I thought that Asian Beauty would be a good choice. The design is nice and the makeup looks are exactly what I was looking for but Kimura doesn't tell you how to achieve those looks. She does mention a 'light and shadows' technique but it is not adequately demonstrated. She also doesn't give product names. I understand that some artists don't give product names because they want to give the reader freedom but it's hard for me to find colors if I don't have a name to go by. All in all, this is a pretty book. Too bad its not a useful one."
1,another disappointed person,"If anyone has read all of the reviews on this book they will notice that overall many consider that the book Asian Beauty falls extremely short of its goal. And if one has read all the posted reviews they will notice that most of the few positive opinions of this book have been posted by (probably) white readers and the majority of the negative (and more realistic) postings were made by Asians who know ""real"" Asian beauty. Like many I was happily awaiting a book dedicated to Asian beauty but as an African American even I noticed the frequent Eurasian featured models and the short and vague makeup advice. At first I thought I would be the only one giving a negative opinion on this book but I am glad that many recognize its faults."
1,NOT WORTH IT!,"I'm an Asian American in my late twenties living in L.A. and lived and traveled in Asia. So I have an idea of beautiful Asian women. And this book does not contain that. The before and after pictures aren't anything any woman (even one as dumb with makeup as me) wouldn't know. The author doesn't take any real make up risks. She gives the basic 411 on eating healthy, excercising, etc.. She emphasizes using eyeliner. However, not all Asian eyes are similar. It's better to just look on the Internet for Asian beauty tips. I was so excited when I ordered it. When I read it, I was sooo disappointed."
1,Terrible!,"This book was completely useless as a tool to help asian women with a creaseless eye. I would have given it a zero star, but I'll give the author a one star for effort."
3,Coffee table book versus instruction manual,"This is a coffee table book, not an instruction manual. For those interested in step by step instructions this book is not for you.Pros: Large, color, real photographs of women of various ages and ethnicities. The stories surrounding the women were interesting, but not really necessary in a book centered on makeup.Cons: As others have stated, the makeup applications are more experimental than classic. Direct advice on how to apply the makeup is scarce and there are no real variations on a theme.Kimura's book is great for admiring, but does little for helping the everyday woman with the practical application of makeup."
5,Beautiful Pages - Great Advice,"I love this book from day one when it came out. It has all the tips and advice you need to apply the makeup. Margaret makes you comfortable with your own skin. She has done interviews with beautiful Asian women of all walks of life. She shows you how to use makeup tools, how to eat right, and take care of yourself. The pages are well done. This book is a must!"
2,Pictures are horible,"Whoever used the computer to edit those pictures in this book must not know how to use the software, because I can do a lot better than that. The pictures are horrible!!!! The pictures are partly blurred and partly filtered, so you can see right at the hair line where the face was blurred out and the hair was still in focus. Ewww..."
1,Durability,I purchased two of these items and have placed one on my side gate entering my back yard...It has broken already....I have one left but am not very happy with the item's durability.... Item has broken and does not seem to be worth the money....Plastic is to brittle...Should be made out of metal.....
2,UNLIKE ARCHER,"ALTHOUGH I AM A DIE HARD FAN OF JEFFERY AND HAVENT MISSED A SINGLE OF HIS WRITINGS ,BUT THIS CONTRIBUTION OF HIS TO THE WORLD OF LITERATURE IS NOT UPTO HIS STANDARDS. MOST OF THE STORIES ARE VERY ORDINARY , EXCEPT TWO , ONE ABOUT A CRICKET MATCH IN WHICH THE CAPTAINS SHOW THE HUMAN ELEMENT IN THE SPORTS, AND THE OTHER STORY WHICH I LIKED WAS A LOVE STORY , THE LAST STORY IN THE BOOK , ONE OF THE BEST LOVE STORIES I HAVE EVER READ ABOUT A COUPLE WHO ARE ARCH RIVALS IN THE FIELD OF EDUCATION YET SPEND THE WHOLE LIFE TOGETHER AND EVEN SHARE THE DEATH BED.REST OF THE STORIES ARE DISAPPOINTING."
3,Good read,"Short stories, some very good but mainly simple plots but very well told. The advantage of kindle download and there it is."
2,Not impressed compared to Red Herrings,"It is OK but I would expect much higher level for the author. Plots are no captivating, too much getting into detail which does not benefit the experience. All other Archer's book will keep me awake till I find out what is going on except for this one. I just ticked the box that I read it.Archer is my favourite author today, i started reading his book in November 2012 and have only couple left. Enjoyed all of them except for this one."
2,A few new Russian viewpoints.,The book is adequately researched. The interviews with former Soviet military personnel and information regarding collisions are interesting. Much of the information about submarine activity has already been published. The authors do a bit of hand-wringing and depart from the subject in the epilogue when they attempt to draw parallels between the Kurst and space shuttle disasters and throw in a call for saving the oceans from pollution. They should have saved that for NPR.
5,Perfect for fidgety kids! (and adults),"Our occupational therapist had this putty, so I went to find some of our own. It's perfect for the fidgets and it builds hand strength; my son's handwriting has improved visibly. I'd recommend for anyone of any age who wants to strengthen hand muscles, work out fidgets, or just wants to create."
5,Fit the bill,"My son's occupational therapist recommended this as a stocking stuffer for him since he had enjoyed using it in OT. It's not cheap, but it never dries out, so it is long lasting. It's relaxing to play with (for me, too), and fairly easy to clean up--the only thing it was impossible to remove it from was a rubber bracelet my son was wearing. It seemed to bond with it permanently."
1,Perfect purchase,I'm a 57yo female with medium size hands. I love having all the different colors and strength. I've recently started martial arts and firearm safety classes. My firearm instuction mentioned I need to strengthen my trigger finger. This is an excellent way to do that. Smooth transaction. Glad I purchased.
1,4oz is really only 2oz,"I was prescribed some therapy putty for my RSD after significantly improving my hand strength and motor skills in physical therapy. My insurance sent me the Cando Theraputty Hand Exercise Putty, 4oz, Green, from amazon and I was shocked when I opened the package to find a decent sized plastic container with only a tiny bit of putty.The putty itself weighs 2oz, with the container close to 3oz-- still NOT EVEN CLOSE TO 4oz stated in the product description.Therapy putty is great for restoring function to your hands, but buy from a different manufacturer that won't cheat you."
5,Parent of child w/autism,We have used this product for many years with my son to increase hand strength and to help manage his stress levels-it is very theraputic and relaxing!!!I would however caution that it can be tricky to get out of carpet and other fabrics especially if it is allowed to sit.
5,Great workout,"This theraputty is great for hand therapy and the progressive resistances makes it even better. Highly recommended if you have any type of hand or wrist injury, but be careful and don't let it come in contact with anything except your hands or the containers as it will attach itself to everything and is a bear to get off. It was delivered promptly."
1,Sad,"I found this book to be more or less devoid of useful or interesting material, with two exceptions. I liked some of the feats presented in the book and I liked the section on creating immortals. The rest of the book was fluff, useless, a waste of space. The book tries to explain goodness to players, all of which know what it means to be good anyway. It presents a whole mess of groupings of deities which anyone could make up on their own, which is basically the way Wizards of the coast present everything divine. Instead of giving 7000 examples of divine beings, why not give us a book about how to build them, details of how divine beings interact, create, and how they fit into the cosmos? Anyone DM truly worth his salt makes all his own stuff up anyway rather than using the junk in books like this and the Manual of the Planes. Spend money on something else like Heroes of Battle, a much better book and more useable."
2,An un-needed book,"In my opinion, this is an un-needed book. Why does a DM need a book full of ""monsters"" that are vastly powerful GOOD beings. In the vast majority of campaigns, the players are good, fighting the forces of evil. With the monsters in this book, the players won't have much to do except watch the battle. This brings up a minor complaint about D&D that I've had since the game first came out...why do the developers always give a slight power edge to good? Wouldn't it make more sense to give a slight power edge to evil, since that's what the players will be fighting against. Take dragons for example. The most powerful good dragon (gold) is a bit more powerful than the most powerful evil dragon (red). All this leads to is the DM having to come up with some reasoning why evil dragons outnumber good dragons, like in Dragonlance Chronicles with the abduction of the dragon eggs. Well, enough rambling off topic. Unless you're DMing a high level evil group, give this one a pass."
3,Exalted Deeds and Vile Darkness,"The Book of Exalted Deeds (BOED) and Book of Vile Darkness (BOVD) have less to do with each other than one might hope. BOVD contains a few interesting spells, a handful of great creatures and demon lords, a bland assortment of feats and prestige classes, and a few side-rules that you might have enjoyed if you need them. The BOED has a very similar spread of content. The quasi-dieties and creatures add a great deal of detail to angels and celestials of many types, and the prestige classes in BOED are fantastic. However, the feats and exalted concept are difficult to work into many games.I recommend the Book of Vile Darkness first, and if you enjoy it enough, the Book of Exalted Deeds helps to fill a niche that balances the table on both ends of the spectrum."
2,Interesting but of little use,"I bought and read some of, skimmed some of, this book. So take this with a grain of salt, but I thought it such a poor value that I retured it immediately.The book has a lot of new classes, most of which seem best adapted to NPCs. It has a lot of new ""monsters"" - angels of the heavens which seem usable only in very narrow, particular campaigns with high level good characters (or evil I suppose). And everything else was pretty lame. The descriptions of what was good and what wasn't; and the ideas surround the Chaotic Good versus Lawful Good is, as D&D is always, simplistic and relativistic; but also useless in a supplement as it is so subjective. The feats were dumb, the items and relic stuff felt like filler, and there wasn't enough focus on how good combats evil and how good campaigns are run or story ideas.In short, I felt like it was an interesting book that would have made a great paperback for $11, but certainly not this full hardback $30 book."
4,Excellent Resource,"A very useful resource, especially for those incorporating the high planes into their campaign."
2,I'm Not a Hater,"But this book is lame. Especially compared to its companion piece, the Book of Vile Deeds. Vile Deeds was cool--it had crazy pictures, an interesting musing on the nature of good and evil [before whole heartedly abandoning that line of reasoning and presenting such morally ambiguous figures as the ""Cancer Mage""], and some really evil stuff to throw at your PCs.This book... well... it has a great cover. No seriously, it's really neet to look at.The inside art isn't very attractive. Most of the add-ons are like ""if your characters become extra special good, they are just so swell! Let's make everything holy or something like that!"" The prestige classes aren't very inspiring either. And it's not really clear [although Vile Deeds wasn't either] about how a non-god figure is more powerful and important than a god figure? I guess it's one of those DnD continuity issues that you just have to grin and bear... or create your own setting!overall, not really worth your time."
5,An Instant Classic!!!!,"I have read this book since I was 4 years old and it has been my favorite book ever since!!! I have enjoyed the wacky and colorful illustrations and the the unique style this book was written in. I also found this book to be extremely funny in the dialogues of each character. Everyone would enjoy the humor and the originality of this book, that is an instant treat to the young and old."
2,Very little content,I felt the video was put together like a nature program instead of something informational about the subject matter. Few actual birds are shown and the wildlife add-on is very small. Overall not what one would expect but not a total loss either. If you want just a glimpse of Costa Rica its okay but not worth the price for what you get.
2,Not powerful enough,"The main reason that I purchased this was the portability, which allows me to move it around my shop (since I don't have an installed system). My experience has shown that a powerful shop vac (I have two Ridgid ones) are more portable (due to the casters) and a heck of a lot more powerful. I have installed this on several machines and found that it is only barely adequate on those that have built-in collection ports. When used as a free-standing collector (router table, drill press, etc.), more goes by the intake than goes in. The unit just doesn't have that much suction power (putting your hand over the intake will demonstrate this)."
1,Delta Portable Dust Collector- Not Worth Your Money,I have a small shop in my garage so wanted a small dust collector. Attached it to a delta planer- Doesn't do the job. Attached it to my router table- Nothing. My portable vaccum is much stronger.Go for a more powerful unit.I'll sell this one (one month old) in a blink.Shame on Delta.
2,review of DELAT portable dust collector,"In 30 years of buying DELTA woodworking products, this is the first one I have not been fully satisifeid with. The collector does not work when connected to a shaper that is using a large diameter raised panel cutter. The collector becomes clogged at the entrance to the blower, at the cross bars, stopping the vacuum effect. Very dissappointed."
2,Good Dust Collector But.....,This device works well as a dust collector but not a chip collector. I have tried to use it with a thickness planer but the chips clog on the intake opening cross bar. It works with my router dust vent okay. I assume it work okay with an sanding table. Don't expect too much from this.
1,delta ap 300,"Glad to see this unit is discontinued, one was given to me by a friend, proved to be a total piece of crap. The bag constantly blows off constantly which make a huge mess.,then the plastic zipper failed which made things worse. The casters are merely decoration its rolls about as easily as a dead Buick. Been a source of aggrivation since it entered my shop, do yourself a favor and keep looking"
1,Gave it away,"Delta AP300 Shopmaster 3/4 Horsepower 680 CFM Horizantal Bag Dust Collector, 120/240-Volt 1 PhaseI gave it away. It is a weak product that does not take in much dust. Bag is a pain to empty. If you are going to get a dust collector, don't expect too much from what you buy unless you get something over $1000."
1,"Weak, i like pioneer speakers & head units but this sub is awful",I bought this sub from walmart a few years back to go with my setup.. i always run a pioneer head unit & 6x9s so i figured id try it. This thing kicked substantially less than my old beat up 10 from the 90's. The sub started smelling like burning wires and blew within the first 2 days of me using it... mind you i was only using a crappy Lightning Audio amp. Do not buy. Go with a Kicker Comp or a cheaper Soundstream instead for a good affordable sub.
5,Beautiful illiustrations and a good story,"We follow a young brother and sister as they're taken to spend a summer with their uncle on a working ranch out west. They learn a great deal about the real life of cowboys, about horses, cattle, wildlife, etc. A worthy companion to the author's book on Indians."
2,Let Down,"This ring was not as expected. The color of the Amethyst is light green, almost translucent and it does not have the two-tone color effect as shown in the picture. I have had this ring for about 6 months, only wearing it 3 times and the stone has fallen out. Beautiful picture but ring is not up to par."
1,"Digitally Remastered Edition? ""NOT""","First of all, the songs on the CD, awesome collection. But to say this was a Digitally Remastered Edition is a joke. The sound quality of this CD is terrible. Secondly, the CD case was not sealed it was cracked and scratched though. Buy the Compact Snap version instead."
4,Crack a book and a smile,"Grammar Snobs is an entertaining read, with grammar lessons wrapped in anecdotal humor. This is not a hardcore reference guide to grammar and should not be judged as such. It is what it is - a scenic route to grammar - a gratifying and amusing trip.Those who are uptight and like to nitpick their way through the English language will probably have a hard time getting through this book... because it will force them to crack a smile and not take themselves so seriously."
5,"FUN, FUN BOOK!!!!","I listen to quite a bit of audio books when I am behind the wheel and sometimes the books can be a bit boring. Not this audio book! Fun listen.Besides having a laugh while listening to the authors stories you're also brushing up on your grammar skills. Learning that the rules are forever changing and that most of the time chances are you the writer or speaker are right.One of the reasons I enjoyed it is because in my head I was able to stick it to those annoying people I've referred to as the ""grammar police"" or what the author called the ""grammar snobs"" who feel the need to correct or ""one up"" on others. I am related to a few of those and if I were inclined I would send them this book but I am sure the significance of it would go over their heads.Anyway, it is a good book where it will either reinforce what you already know/knew or teach you something you did not know in a fun way.Highly recommend!"
5,Fear Writing (and Copyediting Hacks) No More,"I have copyedited and proofread my way through thousands of news releases over the years. That's how I met June. We shared a distaste for a lot of the dry, stilted prose that companies used to inform the public about their products and finances. I was content to complain about bad writing; June went out and did something about it. She wrote a funny, thoughtful book for everyone who wants to write - not for the know-it-alls who only rouse themselves to attack the writing of others. A few of the latter are well represented among these book reviews. For the rest of us who seek an entertaining and empowering guide to freeing the writer within, I recommend this book."
1,You can do better than this,"I found the book rather offensive in tone and quite heavy handed. I consider myself neither a snob nor a meanie; I just want to write good English. If others wish to do the same and still enjoy ""a fun read"", I would recommend Patricia O'Conner's ""Woe is I"" or Bill Walsh's ""Lapsing into a Comma""."
5,"At long last, a simplified gammar book for the real world!","Eat your heart out, Lynne Truss. This is the book you should have written instead of your idiotic Eats, Shoots and Leaves. Congratulations to June Casagrande, she of the Big House, who authored this fine, simplified but accurate overview of the current disarrayed state of English language grammar. Buy this little gem and keep it next to the latest Chicago Manual of Style. Between them, you need not suffer grammarian fools much longer.Bernard KlemStamford CTwhineman@optonline.net"
1,hold,"I still remember the movie ""The Last Emperor of China"" when Reginald Johnstone said to PuYi something like this: Your Majesty, if you cannot say what you mean, you cannot mean what you say.I can appreciate the exceptions in English is perplexing. But it is not a good enough reason to disregard the rules. Even if she believes she has the right approach, there is not reason to belittle others who think otherwise. It is very distasteful. I just cannot finish this book."
3,It helps to prepare but needs to be used with other books as well,"It prepared me well for the exam, but I had to use several other history books and architectural technical dictionaries to complement the information to which they refer to and do not explain or provide with images for a better comprehension."
5,VIRTUE: FREE,I really love this album. You will really love it. It is full of so much anoiting that it will really fill your heart and make you happy. The sisters of Virtue really know how to bring you to your knees and fill you with God's presence.
5,On A Whole New Level!,"Virtue has finally reach a whole new level!! This is their best project so far. With tighter harmonies and elevated production (Pajam, Alex ""Asaph"" Ward, and others) virtue has put out the best project of 2003 in my opinon. I love the Pajam tracks (As usually), but the tune by rising producer Alex ""Asaph"" Ward is really uplifting and anointed. Point Blank: You will not be disappointed with this album!"
5,Buy this CD,"This is what I've been waiting for. Virtue is smooth, hip and soulful. The songs on this album are great quality. The First four songs are jammin, then they slow you down and take you to church. The production on the album is the best they've had. The bass is sometimes a little tired, but Virtue has turned over a new leaf. If you've never purchased a virtue album, and you enjoy christian R&B you'll love it, FREE battles THE KISS from Trin-I-Tee 5:7. Good Job Virtue, you have finally put together a Flawless album."
1,Snowblower cab,"Very poor quality, first time the wind hit it it broke. Do not waste your time or money on this product"
2,Did not last the winter!,"I bought this for my husband for after many snow storms, however the first snow storm he used it the canopy blew off and it was a disaster. Not worth the money and of course we couldn't return it. It also was hard to attach to our snow blower."
4,I think it's good ....,Easy to put together. Not sure about assembly to the actual snowblower. Thankfully we have had an exceptional winter and have not used the snowblower but once. Husband will assembly when needed.
2,Bit of a Cheat,"Don't get me wrong-- watching the continuing journey of this lovely band of pretty misfits is enjoyable enough. The banter still gets heated, there are a good number of fights, and the time devoted to character development (Gojyo) makes for an interesting story arc.However, the quality of artwork seems so rushed, so out of proportion at times, that the characters don't even look human/demon/half/etc.My biggest complaint is that Geneon saw fit to put only 3 episodes on this DVD instead of 4, like all the previous volumes, and yet is charging the same price. The extras aren't all that exciting, and the translucent pencil board that comes ""free"" with the DVD just doesn't thrill me for some reason."
5,Great boxer shorts,Just a note on size - I usually order a 30 waist; some companies size their products smaller than one might expect from sizing guidance (probably due to the trend toward tighter fitting clothing). I ordered size small hoping they weren't too small - even after a wash they fit just fine. The cut of these shorts is almost perfect - roomy enough but not so much fabric that they bunch.The construction and material are both pretty good in quality. Decent value. I'll likely order more.
4,Great boxers,Fit is great. Not long. Great leg room. I will be back for more. The one thing is that the fly opens freely! So be careful if you are wearing them around the house that you dont know!
5,Best coverage of the over 40 crew. surfing hugh Mexico.,"The best example of the over 40 crew surfing hugh Pipeline like tubes of Mexico.The World Masters Championship from Puerto Escondido, Mexico has the great names in the sport from the 60's, 70's competing for $100,000."
3,"yes, punk rock covers!","Rachel, go back to the ghetto and listen to gangsta rap, you have no clue what punk rock is about. The lyrics are silly, I admit it (they're cover songs, btw!) and they are also fun and irreverant. Here are some lyrics for you to ponder: GABBA GABBA HEY!"
5,thanks Robert and Amazon!,I'm interested in Bowie and wanted to see this show for the first time but didn't know about the episodes or picture quality. Thanks to Amazon and Robert's review I now know that the quality is good and that episode one of the show can be found on a DVD by Alpha which is also sold by Amazon! Very helpful. Thanks!
1,"ordered 5 sets of 24 moozles, and",i ordered 5 sets of 24 moozles and only received 5 moozles. there seems to be a theme here.
1,not as advertised!,"BUYER BEWARE! I just received this '24-Count' of Moozles, only there was just a single Moozle in the pack. NOT worth the shipping & handling cost."
3,"Interesting, if not confusing","I have been collecting many of this director's films and find them all to have their own degree of charm. I was somewhat disappointed by this movie.The basic premise and background story to this movie are very good. It's very thought provoking and allows for many interesting things to be done.What disappointed me was that not very much was done. Much of the film has little dialog, and a scratchy picture. So much of it is pretty dull and confusing. The parts that do have dialog are iffy. The parts with the angels and the Presence are pretty interesting, but the ones with everyone else don't really seem to lead anywhere.I rated this right in the middle because I was pretty much 'on the fence' with this one."
2,"sorta (not)cool,I guess","People made it sound like this was a trippy film(and I'm aware that it's a ""b-movie""),but I couldn't really see myself watching this one again unless I was intoxicated.it had a trippy concept, some funny parts,and a few cool sets or lighting techniques though.otherwise it's full of bad acting and build-ups that go nowhere."
1,Just wretched,"An incoherent mess from an anvil-handed hack, and a hell of a lot closer to ""Plan Nine From Outerspace"" than ""Begotten"". I wish I'd flushed my ten bucks down the toilet. At least that wouldn't have required 2 hours of my life. If anyone recommends this movie to you, there's a 99% chance his last name is ""Stanze""."
1,"please eric stanze, stop making movies...","this movie is better then savage harvest (another eric stanze crapfest) but pretty much any movie is. The acting is so-so, seeing as it is a low budget film (extremely low budget). The story is beyond retarded. I'm pissed I bought this and savage harvest at once. Horrible movies by a horrible director."
1,"It's pretty obvious what's going on, isn't it?","I've got to commend the director's friends and family for making such a concerted effort on his behalf, but this movie is a sloppy pile of dung and everybody on this list knows it. Anyone who wants a copy has about three days to retrieve it from my trash can before the city takes it where it belongs. Occupies a space in the annals of film lore somewhere between Plan Nine and Manos: Hands of Fate. Spend your money on meth instead. At least you'll have a few interesting stories."
1,"YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT??","Where to begin? Let's start with the creator eric stanze, seems eric decided one day, ""hey,I don't have any money or talent. I think I'll make a movie!!"" I don't have any other logical explanation for this muddled, dull, lifeless, attempt at making a ""arty"", ""edgy"" horror movie. I won't bore you with the plot. my best advice is to avoid this amaturish excuse for a film. if you like disturbing, dark horror, check out ""the begotten"" or ""tetsuo, iron man"". stay away from this horrid mess."
2,Like a highschool play gone horribly wrong,"I bought this movie about a year ago, and had taken Cid upoun my first viewing. Therefore I thought It was pretty cool. However I whatched this movie again recently(clean and sober) and got the feeling I was whatching some amatuer movie on cable access. The acting is beyond bad, its way way way to long(the opening credits are about 4 mins) the sound is bad, the dialouge is bad. Its just.....not that great. Buy a david lynch or a miike movie instead"
4,I like it,"NOT BAD AT ALL the picture was bad, and the audio was terrible. These flaws were made up by Eric Stanze's creativity in the editing room. He's an amazing editor, lots of cuts, and creative filters-- A lot like Olive Stone's style in NBK- and U Turn. The sound effects are wicked creepy-- and MR. Stanze uses them very well, I think he should take his creativity to the next level. Since this film he hasn't released anything that compares to this effort, I'm sure he'll read this, and he knows that we know he has what it takes to do great things-- GO FOR IT BIG GUY-- LEAVE SUB ROSA, it's crap, and you're mind isn't."
4,A unique independent film experience,"This movie has a very unique look and feel to it. Everything from the lighting, the camera work, and the editing give this movie a personality all its own. There are also a few scenes in which graininess and scratches are used to emphasize certain images. The death scenes are amazing! Pretty realistic and very bloody. Highly recommended to anyone looking for something strange and outside of the Hollywood hog trough."
5,Great person to deal with,Very happy with the book I received so quickly. Was happy when I looked at the book and it was new.
4,Molto chiaro.,"Il contenuto è molto chiaro e comprensibile anche per le principianti. L'Autrice è estremamente simpatica e certamentemolto brava. Complimenti!! Patrizia Rossini, Roma, Italy"
5,Reversible Quilts,I love this book and the technique. Great for a quilt that you want done when you finish piecing it together. This is a fun way to trade blocks too!
5,Arc on the Horizon,Arc on the Horizon aims at the highest spiritual nobility. There is sheer brilliance of language...powerful dialogue and story line...The details are just stunning coming from the pen of one who appears to have actually witnessed the events...a book that all lovers of spirituality should read in 2002.
1,Don't order from this company,I ordered 2 bottles of my favorite vanilla/lavender lotion. It took 2 months to arrive with a dozen phone calls and email pleads. They also sent me 8oz size vs the 12oz size that I paid for. No follow up note or anything. Good luck if you order from them.
5,comfort in a cute package,"The Berman Center Isis Begining Pelvic Exercisor truely is easy to use. It also has a comfortable shape and size plus it comes with a cute drawstring pouch for convienant storage. The package has easy to follow diagrams with easy to read instructions. The one drawback I found with the packageing is trying to find the instructions hidden among the other words on the package, but once found they are easy to understand."
3,Expecting more that I got,"Emily Collins is 34 weeks pregnant when a medical condition puts her in the hospital. A stress free stay is what she needs, instead she finds out her husband has cheated on her, she lost a promotion at work, her sister is having money problems and to top it off the hospital that she is at is closing. But Emily is determine not to let any of these problems to get her down.""Expecting Emily"" is the first book and will most likely be the last by Clare Dowling that I will read. I just thought that there were so many stories going on, that the author did not focus on Emily's story. Other readers may like it, but ""Expecting Emily"" was not for me."
3,Attention Grabber,Captives in Time is about a girl named Anne and her brother Niklas who overcome many obstacles to be successful by building a clock.I thought this was a good book because two siblings overcame great obstacles in order to be successful.I also thought it was a good book because things happened right away and grabbed your attention immediately.This book would be good to someone who enjoys a book with a middle ages theme.
1,Junk,"I've had this belt for not to long, and already have had to replace the belt because all the plastic buckles (of which there are a quite a few) have broken. Now I have a halfway serviceable belt I have to tie on every day."
1,Builders Rig Bust,"I am thoroughly dissapointed in this item!! It was extremely uncomfortable, the suspenders rubbed my neck all day. The pouches would not stay where I wanted them and liked them for comfortable wear. I have worn combinations of belt and suspenders before with success but never ones desgined to work together. These are a huge dissapointment, and I am glad I only lost $40.00 on the purchase!"
2,diminished quality,"I have owned 3-4 of these tool belt systems. They worked well for what you are buying for a good price(at first). With each new purchase of the item the condition and build quality was different and cheaper made with each one. The belt thickness would change, the style of suspender would change, different clips or hardware where they were attached. The most recent one I purchased will have me seeking a different type when it comes time to buy another one. I guess maybe the next iteration COULD be built better as it always changes, but how would you know that before you buy."
4,"Nice, sturdy, comfortable","I like this rig a lot, it is comfortable and seems of sturdy construction. However, I wish the pockets were deeper, and the rid is just a tad big for my body (5'7'', 230 lbs). This thing is huge."
3,Ok,This is OK. The buckle isn't so great. It can pop apart at any time. The pockets can easily tear.I would spend a little more money next time an get something that would last.
4,bucket boss air lift tool rig review,"The Bucket Boss Air Lift rig is a fantastic tool rig, its very comfortable and does not cause any pain when wearing it while working. the material is good for the job it does it can carry alot of weight and room for everything you need. plus the location of the hammer loop is good it does not bang on the leg. and the size of the whole rig is perfect. as a carpenter i say this is a must get but when u get it change the belt, because the belt it comes with is rubbish."
3,Ordeals,"When a diamond expert as enthusiastic as Larry Carr gets an instruction from his psychiatrist suggesting that he takes a vacation in a form of change-of-atmosphere. He grabs the chance by moving into Luceville, an industrious town. His first chance was to engage himself as a social worker, but when he meets the vicious and ruthless Morgan Rhea, chase begins to unleash his readers into a world of suspense and criminal thrilling adventures of rapid and devastating adventure of annoying fiction."
2,"""Twilight"" by Shaun Groves","With the song ""See You"" being in the leadoff spot on this c.d. you think that your in for what you had on ""Invitation To Eavesdrop"": A wonderful mix of Steven Curtis Chapman style groove songs and some wonderful ballads. This just wasn't the case. While ""See You"" is a hilight on this c.d., everything else just takes a nose dive after ""Blank Page"", which is a great song also. Both of these songs are worthy of being on Shaun's ""Invitation"" c.d. I think what Shaun did was just put way too much emphasis on sappy ballads and the remaining two uptempo songs were just too cliched to really get into. I hate to say it, but I think Shaun got hit by the Sophmore jinx on this one. Hopefully this one will do good for Shaun's sake, but I also hope that when he makes a third c.d., he'll make more songs in the style of ""Damage Done"", ""Should I Tell Them?"", and ""Move Me"""
2,Expectations dashed,"I liked SG's first CD so much I went out and bought this one sight unseen (ear-unheard?). I disliked the slower ballad songs from the first CD and was hoping he would have at least an equal mix on the new one. No way. It was full of slow and boring ballads. Shaun, go back to your roots! Songs like ""Should I Tell Them"", ""After the Music Fades"", ""Satellite"", ""Move Me"", and ""Damage Done"" were what made you semi-famous so fast in the first place. Why didn't you follow that same formula for success in your new album? Leave slow ballads to Jars of Clay, as you really aren't that good at the slow stuff (sorry guy!) and keep making the semi-heavy metal type songs with awesome lyrics found in your first album, that you are SOOOO good at. I'm so dissapointed... In fact, I think I'll go sell it on ebay or something. I should have sampled the songs or downloaded them via K---- first prior to purchasing it. What a waste. Sorry man."
4,BCI Does It Again,"BCI are quickly becoming one of the best sources for offbeat Japanese films. THE QUIET DUEL was the only film directed by Akira Kurosawa with music by Akira Ifukube (Godzilla). Until this DVD release, it was also the only Kurosawa title that I did not have in some form, and I'm pleased to report that, while not in the league of IKIRU or SEVEN SAMURAI, THE QUIET DUEL is still well worth seeing, and a must for all devotees of the great Toshiro Mifune. He is fine in this early role as a medical doctor who makes a tragic error. Also on hand is Kurosawa regular Takashi Shimura, who was so memorable in IKIRU. Altough this film is far from the director's best, even lesser Kurosawa is eminently recommendable, and the many fans of Maestro Ifukube will certainly want to check this out. The picture quality is fine, no problems with the disc, packaging is outstanding and the price is about half of what Criterion would ask...Thank you, BCI!"
2,"Okay book, no real companion site","The book is okay as far as textbooks go, but there is no real companion site. Most textbooks have decent companion sites with study guides, quizzes, glossary, etc. This one has none of that, only the slides that go with the chapter."
2,not so good,I got this book for fiction read aloud for my seven year oldson. I'm glad that I read it my self first. This book has several cuss words in it and the kids in the book do not behave very well at all.
2,Nice scent but PRICEY,After purchasing this from here for $55 I discovered many other sights where it is much cheaper. But it does have a great scent.
3,ok,"I love this fragrance ive purchase it in the pass many years ago but it was discontinued, i was happy to find it on amazon. another thing i remember this was a very strong perfume all you had to do was spray it once thats all was needed. any way just got it today and sprayed it and i am disappointed it has its great scent but didnt last long i sprayed some on my wrist an hour ago and the scent is now gone so disappointed ugh! well any way the search continues"
5,Incredible saw,"This saw is worth the money! I was weary about purchasing it since there are so many mixed reviews about saws and this one seemed to have people saying it was too heavy. Lemme just say that's not the case. It's no feather, but I have no problems walking up and down stairs and to/from the truck and I doubt it would be a problem for anyone that would be buying a 12"" miter saw! It was dead accurate out of the box, which it was packed in beautifully. The twin lasers make cutting so easy, I almost feel guilty when I'm using it. You won't believe how fast you'll install trim with this saw! There is no table flex like the DeWalt, and no ""kick"" when the motor starts. Just an excellent saw, makes crown molding a breeze. I can't think of any negatives."
5,Best miter saw I've used,"This is the best miter saw I have used. Everything was perfect out the of the box, I didn't have to adjust a thing to get started.One thing to note is that this doesn't come with a finish blade out of the box, so plan on spending another $50 - $75 for a good 80T blade."
2,Misleading partnumber !!,I was ready to buy this 'nice' piece when I stumbled across some of the fineprint:36-255L bevels ONLY left 4536-255 bevels left & right 45So the 50$ I would have been paying more gives me a laser but on the other hand takes away the double bevel function. That is too expensive a trade off.I ended up not buying this particular saw but a double bevel one from a different manufacturer and adding a separate laser unit :-)
5,Great Saw,"I can't say anything bad about this saw. The lasers are a dream. I want lasers on everything now. The only thing I have to deal with is its right side laser gets obscured by dust after a couple hundred cuts. This, of course, is easily rectified by simply sticking your finger up there while the saw is plugged in - ha! Caught you sleeping! Practice safety on the job! Unplug your saw to clean the laser lens with a soft artist's brush, and this saw will keep you smiling. Safety first!"
