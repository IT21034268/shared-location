2,Not for woodworking,"I bought this planer yesterday after work at the ""Blue"" home center. I was going to buy the DW734 12.5"" planer, but decided this one looked better. Boy was I wrong. This planer has plenty of power and leaves a nice finish, but it snipes very, very badly, way beyond acceptable limits, and that was with a narrow, short piece of wood. They claim there is a built-in cutter head lock, but it must be a ghost. This thing snipes worse than a Ryobi without a cutter head lock. I returned it first thing this morning and bought the DW734. It is what I was looking for. With the cutter head locked, there is only 1 to 2 thousandths snipe, easy to sand off. Save yourself a bunch of money and buy the DW734. This planer, DW735, doesn't perform to the price tag. Buy the DW734."
2,Bad part ruins planer,"Planer worked great for a short period of time and then the front sprocket that drives the rollers broke into three pieces. I have not run a hundred board feet thru yet and its broke. Should have bought a stationary one, besides by the time you buy the planer, Dewalt mobile base, and folding wings your almost there cost wise anyhow and would have alot better machine."
1,Weak blades,"I've only used my machine a short time running cedar through it. Was really impressed for a few runs, then I started having ridge and scrape marks the length of the wood. Thinking I had a chip in the knives, I reset them with new edges. Same problem. Took the scarred stick of lumber along w/ the machine to a Dewalt service store. After a quick glance at the wood, the tech said he knew right away what the problem was. Dewalt put too weak of a blades in the machine, and he said that when the blades cut though knots it fractures the blade. He also said there weren't any heavier blades one could put in it. His suggestion was to gripe to Dewalt so maybe if enough people complain, they might do something about it. No refund, so I left my planer at the shop and asked them to sell it and send me the money. Sensless having a machine that won't work in my shop. Just bought a General 30-115M1 planer. Built like a tank."
2,Nice Planer very Poor Knives - Dewalt needs Carbide or Real Tool Steel,"I just bought a DW735 and after planing three 8' x 7"" x 1.125 thick walnut to .75 thick the M2 tool steel knives are leaving raised lines just as bad as the 15 year old knives my Ryobi AP10. The only reason I replaced the AP10 was I wanted to plane wider boards. If the knives would plane more than 24 board feet the planer would work just fine. I am thinking about returning the paner for another brand if I can not get better knives for it."
1,Can you rate an item less than 1 star? Do not buy this thing!,"Basically I should have read the reviews before getting this. If I could give this thing 0 stars I would. I replaced an older dewalt planer with the 735 and thought it was a good price for the features. Well, I have planed about 30 board feet of 4/4 cherry and if your boards aren't perfectly flat to begin with you are done. I don't mean twisted and warped, I mean 1/8th of inconsistency and you are done. Instead of bogging down the motor, the planer catches it and it kills the rollers. Have that happen a couple times and you will wish the thing bursts into flames. I'm sure I will be told I am using it wrong but I know that is not the case. I have been very patient with the thing but now I have given up. Going to get a new planer, not Dewalt."
3,"Nice Planer, Horrible Knives","This planer is easy to use, has quite a bit of power and the knives change easily. I had no problem connecting a portable vacuum to the planer to control the dust.My problem with this machine is the knives. The first project I used this for was to plane rough sawn walnut. After planing only two boards I noticed indents that ran the entire length of the wood. I changed to the other side of the knives and the same problem appeared again. I bought it 3 days ago and I returned the planer earlier today.I think that the fit and finish are top notch. I had no problems with the adjustments or changing the blades for that matter. At the end of the day the tool is useless if the blades are low grade steel. For $499 it would be nice to have higher quality blades."
1,Feed problems,"Cabinetmaker 20+ years, this planer doesnt feed well. After exchanging planer had same problem. Rep told me to run at slow speed but that didnt help. Plus whats the sense in two speeds if one doesnt work. Bad design and possibly dangerous as it could kick back if not feeding properly. If you dont help the wood thru sometimes it wont feed at all. Very disappointing."
4,Feed Problems and fixed by waxing base plate!,"When I read all the reviews on other sites that this planer had wood feed problems, I thought I had the only good one that worked. But now after a month of light use mine also stopped feeding wood - I had to push and pull the wood (hard) through the planner. Got burn marks on the wood when it stopped.DeWalt suggested cleaning the rollers, making sure the folding tables were set 1/8"" above the base, changing the hardly used blades, and pre-planing the wood on my jointer... yuk!!I read a review by Blade10 (another site) - stating that he lubed the planer's bed and made a ""new machine"" out of his. Thanks to Blade10!!! I used butchers wax on my bed and wow, my machine works again... The base bed is quite large and not as hard as it might want to be... gets minor scratches on it's surface and causes more friction than the feed rollers can overcome. The wood then won't feed .Wax or lube the bed and it will work great again."
2,$25 per project on blades,"I have had this machine for a year and I automatically charge all my custom in build cabinets and furniture a $25 dollar surcharge for blades, this planer is faboulous for about 30 board foot of lumber, a typical project. Then you can flip 'em over and do one more project. It would actually be cheaper to let my hardwood supplier surface two sides that to run this very expensive planer. Dewalt, listen up!!! You may have the DIY and weekend enthusist blinded by your fancy marketing and race cars but professionals are starting to grumble, put your house in order, include the accessories to achieve the best results!"
1,DeWalt DW735 was a mistake,"I should have read other reviews before purchasing this thing. I bought it for my wife to use in her clock shop for the occasional replacement of a panel for a cuckoo clock. On the first project, it lasted all of an hour of light use before the drive belt broke. That was $27.42 plus tax and gas for a two hour drive. Then the blades were dull within another hour of use. We never tried to take off more than 1/32"" at a pass from clean clear walnut. Flipping the blades was easy, but at $55 for new ones this could get expensive. Unfortunately, we let it sit un-used for over a year so it can't be returned. I'm shopping for something else. I love all the rest of my DeWalt tools, of which there are many."
1,Not reliable,I was going to buy this planer from Amazon but wanted to see one before parting with my hard earned $$. Visited a local woodshop where the guy told me he had been canibalizing machines for parts as his customers were complaining about breakages. One guy had his break twice in a week on simple planing operations.Sounds like the reviewer that talks about a design issue with the new DeWalt got it right. I wouldn't part with the serious cash needed to buy this machine until I heard definitively that the problem is fixed.
2,Wouldn't buy it again,"I waited eight months to write this review hoping that I would grow to like the DW735 planer. No chance!I really only have two problems with the planer but they are critical problems.First, as most people have stated, the blades wear out very quickly and are expensive to replace. I have used three sets already and have only owned this planer for eight months. The last set of blades I bought were carving grooves in the wood after just one day of planing maple. That's pretty bad!Second, the roller feeders get dirty very easily and don't pull the wood through so I find myself having to help the wood pass through the planer. This is very frustrating as I would prefer to let the feeder do the feeding.On the plus side the planer does plane the boards very flat. But, because the blades dull so quickly I still have to do quite a bit of sanding after planing to get rid of the ridges and grooves that have been cut into the wood by the planer.No, I wouldn't but this model again."
4,Very good planer,"I have owned this thickness planer for about 6 months and used it for a few projects. The surfaces are excellent on a variety of woods--so far I've used it on curly maple, cumaru, cherry, poplar, and oak with no issues. Dust collection is good with just my whining shop vac attached. Set-up was a snap and worked great right out of the box.So why not 5 stars? Two reasons: first, the ""optional"" extension tables are not at all optional. Without them, the planer has significant snipe; with them attached there is no appreciable snipe (<1/64"" at worst). At this price point the extension tables definitely should have been included, and I would not recommend buying this planer without them.Second, the knives are disposable, which could run into significant expense down the road compared to sharpening them. Replacement knives run about $50 a set. Thankfully I haven't needed to replace them as yet."
4,I bought mine on sale at Lowes for $399,Great machine. I had a Delta and I find this cuts better and is more powerful. The two speed settings is another feature I like and use.
1,More time cleaning than working,"OK so apart from the knives becoming dull within 1 hour of starting this machine up, I feel it is necessary to comment on the poor dust evacuation. I use this planer with a high powered dust collector connected at all times. For some reason I am constantly having to remove the case and manually clean out the cogs and chain as they have become so clogged that turning the depth adjuster is impossible. I don't know if I am the only person who seems to have this problem.I would not recommend this planer as it seems to be the proverbial money pit with regards to new blades and constant repairs, not to mention wasted man hours."
3,Disapointed and now my back hurts,"I went to lowes after much anguish as to which planer to buy. I bought the dw735 at $549 brand new in the box factory sealed btw. Well I got the beast home by myself, down the steps, mounted onto my workbench. I also went out the next day and got some hose fittings so I could attach my vac if I wanted to. Well after all that I went to power it up for the first time this morning so I could plane the boards I have, and...... utter disapointment. The unit did not even power on. The manual said to check the power cord, dust port, and top cover. All seemed fine, even the outlet was working fine with other items. So needless to say, less than 1/2 hour of my first attempt to use the thing, it has been returned to lowes. Now I wish I had not bothered with this unit and had gone with something else instead.Edit to my review. I returned the defective unit for another unit. Works great. I ended up with a busted one first."
2,"Disappointing Results, Returned the Planer.","I am a professional woodworker, and I decided that I needed a portable planer in addition to my Powermatic 160. I bought this one over the others for two reasons: it supposedly did not need a headlock and the blower/chip ejector meant it was it's own dust collector (this feature worked well). The problem? The knives are GARBAGE! They last about 30 minutes before they are dull. At that point, two things start happening. The feed rollers start to need help pulling the wood through AND the supposedly self-locking head creeps upward as the wood is pulled through. These problems render this machine nearly useless. I understand that planer knives get dull, but these dull much faster than any other knives I've used, and because of the quick-change system (which is nice, I have to admit) they are your only choice. I was extremely disappointed with this machine. I own other Dewalt tools and am very happy with them. I returned the planer to where it was purchased."
1,DW735,"This is a good planer for very small projects. If you want to run a decent board through the DW 735 make sure you have plenty of extra drive sprockets. I have gone through at least two dozen drive sprokets in the first month of operation with the DW735. The earlier models (DW733 and DW734) have fewer or no problems because the drive sprockets are durable. It seems the management at DeWalt saved some money on the smaller drive sprockets on the DW735 and increased the costs for the consumer. If you want to make small bird houses out of cedar (without knots) this may be a good planer for you; however, if you want a decent quality planer buy an older model or a different brand with durable drive sprockets. The drive sprockets on the DW735 are not designed for durability."
1,Sprockets Broke,"After using the planer sporatically for a year, the front sprocket running the feed rollers snapped in two. The closest repair center is 2-1/2 hours away and works M-F 8-5. I bought my planer after reading that DeWalt had ""fixed"" this problem, and made sure my serial number was in the later batches. This problem should have triggered a recall notice. We'll see how much it costs to fix this problem. Oh, and snipe is still a problem with this machine, even with the outfeed table supports. (And Wood Magazine gave this Top Tool rating... )(Update: Sprockets and a new chain (just in case) cost under $20 shipped, and arrived within 2 days. No problems since.)"
4,"Dewalt 13"" planer",The Dewalt planer did a great job on 1x4 r.s. cedar. It took all the rouggh sawn off in one pass on 3 pieces at a time. Very good tool...
1,planer,Unfortunately I have had a bad experience with this product. I have to rate it a 1 star until I can get an oportunity to use it. This 1 star is for Amazon selling something that does not work. My son has the same planer and he is very happy with it so I am sure it will be great when I get it back. I unpacked it only to find out that it does not work. The repair shop cannot tell what happened for sure but they had to order some parts. Hopefully I will be able to tryout the item soon.
5,It's Plane Great,"After my Delta 12"" Thickness Planer casting Cracked, I was in need of a medium duty Planer and I've had lots of good experience with Dewalt stuff..( May the Delta quality curse not affict this new aquisiton of their's as others have succommened in the past)I have run thick and thin stock through it and it seems to be holding up well. I have one just like it at my other job and it's done well also.The knives are also very easy to change, a characteristic I have come to demand lately on my Thicknerss Planers and Jointers.And it arrived very quick and in good working order. Thanks much"
1,do not buy this planer,"i am a hobby guy, thus not planing very much board feet of lumber. i purchased a planer in 2009 and by 2010 the end feed rollers split. the 2 speed shifter froze up and would not work. the inside blower was put on backwards from the factory. the plastic housing around the blower broke because the blower was put on backwards. and yes the blades also were dulled quickly. dewalt sent me a brand new planer with brand new blades to replace original purchase that went bad. the replacement worked good for less than one year and the motor burnt out. dewalt says that it is not under the one year warrantee because the replacement planer was to fix the original purchase planer.so i suggest to not waste your money. a guy is now fixing the planer for me . i would just junk it but i have too many blades for it that i bought to just throw them away too."
4,Dewalt DW735 thickness planer,I'm a wood sculptor and I often find it necessary to laminate boards in order to get the size I need for a project. The mating surface's need to be as flat as possible in order to do this properly. This DEWALT planer has met my expectations in this regard. It's out of the box ready. The only assembly required was to attach the thickness hand crank with one screw. I highly recommend this tool to anyone who has a need to plane boards to a specific thickness.
2,Buy a more reliable planer than this!,"I would not recommend the DeWalt DW735. The blades wear out extremely quickly and are expensive to replace. For the price of this planer I expect them to last much longer than they do. Snipe really isn't that great on this planer though snipe is always an issue and can be dealt with by planing boards that are longer than the required finished length.Check out the reviews for the Makita or Delta planers. They are much better than the DeWalt (esp Makita). I wish I had taken this into account before spending $$ on this over-priced, under-performing planer.On the positive side, the dust collection on this machine is great."
2,visual disaster made in France,"if the french could simply refrain from laying their hands on Teutonic arts, they would have made contributions to the civilization, and everyone would have thanked them...but as in this case, they totally ruined wagner's die walkure by some of the stupidest stage arrangements. the singing is so so, but the stage setting is unpleasant visually,not to mention some of the singers sweated like pigs, ehhwww... that's french's sophisticated wagner interpretation... and my $50 down the toilet."
3,chewy snack,"definitely not a fruit roll up and definitely leathery. I like to nibble on it to stave off my hunger. if you are looking for a quick fruity snack, you're looking at the right product. p.s. i bought mango"
2,Not so tasty,tastes like plastic! Tastes nothing like mango at all. Its lightly flavored..not sure what it tastes like. but its pretty flavor-less.I wouldn't recommend this flavor.
1,too tough,"We love fruit leather, but this is almost impossible to eat it is so tough. My kids can't even eat it. I will not buy this brand again."
5,"Mango is good, but the Cherry is better!","Great snack, good source of vitamin C and Potassium. Much cheaper than in stores, much better than the standard supermarket ""candy"" type."
5,Great snack,My kids totally love these things. I like that they make a great snack when we're away from home and that they are all natural.
5,Definition of organic,"I expected this to taste really sweet like the fruit leather you get at Target, but it was the opposite and wasn't so bad."
3,This isn't one of the more popular flavors...,"My customers enjoy the strawberry, but this one didn't go over as well. I've introduced it twice now, but it hasn't been making fans. I make purchases that disappear fairly quickly. This one has been lingering for an indefinite period among my clientele."
5,delicious,We've always loved the taste and getting it delivered to our door step for a great price from amazon makes it ideal. I have two almost 4 yr olds who love this as a snack and so do I. We subscribed this product for ourselves and another family member.
3,Care to be confused?,"I recently read Jazz as part of an English assignment. While the book is good, it's often easy to get lost. My suggestion is that you read its preceding book in this trilogy, Beloved, before you read Jazz. The characters in the book are well-developed and have interesting, unique personalities. If you like stories set in the big city this book describes it in detail, as well as the open countryside. The only downfall of this book, in my opinion, is that Morrison likes to float through time landing irregularly, so it's sometimes hard to know where you are, and with whom."
4,Jazz,"I found Jazz to be confusing in the beginning, however if it wasn't I don't believe it would be a Toni Morrison book. I say this in a good way. I have not read all her books but the books I have read has taken me awhile to get into before given up on the book all together. I thought it was enjoyable reading. It was a three way love affair that went bad but ended up back to a two way love affair."
5,BEAUTIFUL work of literature!!!,"This book just sends shivers up and down my spine every time I read it. So very elegant it is written, to say the least. Ms. Morrison's novel touches on every emotion within the human realm, and with each new reading I find it new and invigorating. I am an avid reader, and I must say that this is a DEFINITE favorite!!! A must-read!!!"
4,"Jazz's rhythm was hard to get into, but tied up beautifully.","I found Jazz difficult to get into as the rhythm of the story was confusing at first. I wasn't immediately ""lured in"" like in Sula, the other book of Toni Morrison's that I have read. The style began flowing smoothly once I hit the midway point, when the story seemed to build and to be going somewhere. The second half was page-turning. I found the characters more understandable, drawn to their grief, intrigued by their quirks. It is a story of longing - for love, for proper parenting and for hope. A good, easy read with a lesson in patience - once you get to the end, you're glad you suffered through the slow beginning and learned the meaning of long-term commitment, as Morrison teaches throughout the book."
3,A thin line between love and hate.,"Although this was not one of Toni Morrison's best novel Jazz was excellent, filled with love, hate, murder and suspense. Once you started reading you will not want to put the book down."
5,Pure genius!!,"This book is aptly titled JAZZ, as it's entire rythm is full of trilling notes and lyrical phrases. I lost myself several times in the unmatchable prose and style of Ms. Morrison. Only to find myself mired in the deep bass and trembling crescendos of black love. Ms. Morrison's descrptions of under-the-covers love felt right. Anyone ineterested in going for a musical ride that begans in the deep south and ends in Harlem should jump aboard!"
2,Confused and Frustrated,"I forced myself to finish Jazz based on the author's critical acclaim, but what a waste of time. Other than the few snippets of imagery that I still remember, the storyline was extremely difficult to follow and the characters were not at all well developed. Jazz was the second Morrison novel (after Beloved)I've read, and it will be my last because I don't possess the mental gymnastics/framework she requires."
3,Interesting Structure,"Jazz is an interesting novel, and in some ways the characters ring truer than in her most acclaimed work, Beloved. The story unfolds in a totally brilliant way, we see the key event in the narrative from multiple points of view, and the character's perspective from many points in time. The narration is also deliberately self-conscious and at times humorous, though I was annoyed by her stream of consciousness at the book's end. Still, Morrison does an excellent job weaving character, moral ambiguity, violence, race, and sociology in a vivid mosaic of Harlem life."
3,Difficult to read,"I had to read this book for my English class. I am studying Secretary-Languages. I found it very difficult to read. Maybe it is because I am Dutch speaking. I almost finished the book when I realised it was about black people. It also took me a long time to find out what the book was all about and I think I still don't understand it totally. But, all considered, I think the book is quite nice. It didn't take me long to read it, so that is a sign that is was quite good."
5,Jazz - it's a kind of music - improvised!,"The key to understanding this amazing novel is in the title. Each character is a Jazz instrument, playing and embellishing his or her theme, then stepping aside while the theme is picked up by the next instrument/character with variations. This is improvisational music, not a composition, more like a jam session. It is therefore improvisational literature - not hard to understand, just beautiful, energetic, and extremely clever.Enjpy!"
2,Dazed and Confused,This book deals with the story of a couple in New York City during the Harlem Renaissance. The book has many underlying themes and symbols throughout. It was difficult for me to draw the connections of the symbols to their meanings. While I read I had a hard time keeping up with the narritive because the scences changed rapidly. When I finished reading it I felt like I needed someone to come and explain all the symbolism used in the novel. However I do enjoy Morrison's descriptions of the city before and during the Harlem Reniassance and how jazz was an expression of Black's emotions during the time period. This was my first Morrison book and I was not too happy with the overall feeling I got but hopefully her other works are more clear cut.
4,The Real World,"This book taught: That day to day is completely different for African people, That America will always have a main system along with alternative governed by ethnic groups, and more."
4,Morrison's best,"Jazz is by far one of Morrison's best works! The story is great, but not the strongest part. This book shines because it's so lyrical, so poetic, so magically written.With the odd, experimental narrator it's almost like a long love letter, someone telling a story of lost love to a love that can not be fullfilled. When I read the final few pages I could see Morrison sitting down and writing this to that special someone she's never been able to communicate to."
2,"Picture It: Harlem, 1920s, Geezer Kills Teen With Impunity","Toni Morrison is one of the most brilliant writers of this century, but this book is a mere shadow of her usual ability. Again, Morrison tries to show how people can bear the unbearable and the twisting effects of it. But I think a more fitting title for this book would have been ""Complacency"". The characters in this book are so stalwart in their misery that not even murder can compel them to action or change. I almost got the feeling that Morrison was offering the victim as a warning, like: ""that's what you get for being a slutty girl. Don't ever try be vibrant."" This story had the opposite feeling of jazz, for jazz soars and falls with new times and new constantly-improvised melodies."
1,Horribly Disappointed.....,"I was very disappointed in this novel. It was uninteresting and I didn't feel that it ""all came together"" in the ending. I would not recommend this book to anyone. Definitely not on the same level with some of her other works."
2,Wrong book!,We wanted a particular cover so that my daughter could follow through with the book they use in class. She was quite careful to select one with the same cover - dissapointing to get another edition.
5,an all encompassing history of classical warfare,"This is a superb ""history"" of classical warfare as practised by Greek and Roman armies. The reason I state ""history"" and not just an encyclopedia is because the book is set out in a chronological order and not purely as your typical encyclopedic style ie. not alphabetically. However this presentation is much more logical and lucid. The writing is very good and not at all dry and the illustrations are superb. This book has all one needs to know about warfare in the classical world of Greece and Rome and even includes details and illustrations of the various foes fought by the Greeks and Romans such as the Persians, Carthaginians and Celts. My only difficulty now is to decide whether this book is better than ""Greece and Rome at War"" by Peter Connolly...."
5,Amazing reference,I was very pleased with this work. It is a good starting off point for study/interest in classical warfare. The illustrations and diagrams are well done and help to illuminate the text in many places. Highly recommended.
4,She loved it,I bought this for my grandmother in law and she really enjoyed and that is all I can ask for.
3,No noticeable difference on Energy Levels or Concentration.,"I purchased the 15 serving (7 day) package, tried it according to the instructions (twice daily), but didn't seen any noticeable difference in energy or concentration.Not sure if one week is enough time for this product to perform, and I also understand that every product is not right, or as effective, for everybody.Obviously, one week won't tell me anything about the long term effects, such as detoxing, immune, and aging.I'd be reluctant to try it again without first understanding why it didn't live up to it's claims initially.If anybody else has had a difference experience (not just psychosomatic), or can recommend another product, I'm listening."
4,Dewalt DW7353 chip collection accessory,Works great. Bag is large and will fit a 55 gallon drum. It's great to not have the mess and cleanup.
3,Works but not well,"This was a little disappointment. I hope to figure out a way to keep the sawdust from blowing out of the sides. It doesn't seal well, but it does catch most of the sawdust. Maybe 3/4 of it."
2,dont waste your money,Take the $50 you pay for this and put it towards a dust collector. This thing makes such a mess. I ended up having to buy a dust collector after i purchased this wish i would have just bought the dust collector to begin with.
4,Chip collection,"Item works well for collecting chips, greatly reduces dust and is a great alternative to a dust collection system. I would suggest using a metal garbage can or a 55-gallon drum. Also, secure the hood with a band clamp or ratchet strap, the one provide is not quite strong enough."
3,"works good, it still leaks a little on the saw dust","works good, it still leaks a little on the saw dustrope should beable to get tighter or with more elastic added to it"
1,DEWALT DW7353 Chip Collection Accessory for DW735 Planer,"I was not happy with Accessory kit for my planer. It did a terrible job. I ended up buying a bag from another manufacturer that attached to the hose. With this bag, I had more dust outside than inside the container that I was trying to put it into. Look for something else to work with your planer."
3,Elvis lives!,"Of course, Elvis isn't alive, but this book is indeed a very nice ""tongue in cheek"" look at Elvis. I wouldn't regard it as ""great literature"", but it is easy to read, has no pretentions and gives you a nice thought about how you would react when you'd find out that Elvis faked his death. The cover is simple, but also special (you can actually feel the grooves of the LP). It isn't a ""must for every Elvis fan"", but if you like to read a fictional novel about Elvis Presley, this is the one!"
5,A Fun Read,"This is a fun read for anyone who is a fan of Elvis Presley or the history of rock n roll. Whether You believe that Elvis could possibly still be alive, or that he has truly gone to the big green room in the sky, Maughon does a good job of keeping you guessing in a fun and visual way.Regardless of your belief, or perhap...your wish that EP was still alive, You will finish this book more convinced than every before, that EP was, is and shall remain ""The King"" of Rock and Roll!!!Gotta go now...I think I just saw Elvis drive by my house!!!"
1,Unoriginal.........,"The concept of this book is so cliche, I would suggest the reader not waste their time with this one........."
1,Rather disgusting,"I bought the pack of 12 and regret doing so. I thought these would be decent soups for their price but I was regretfully wrong. The soups are bland and taste exremely horrible and to add, they smell foul also! I can only stomach things and I'm going to donate the rest of the pack."
3,A Personal Performance Piece,"""Via Dolorosa"" is a play in the sense that it has been performed on the stage. Who besides David Hare himself would dare perform it, I can't say. It would take guts. Who would finance such a performance? Anyway, this is an essay for the stage. I thought it very interesting, chiefly because the New York audience drew Isrealis who were enraptured by Hare, sat bolt upright, and reacted with every inch of their souls. This could and should have been done in a lecture hall at the U.N., not B'Way but ... It is a fascinating exploration and almost as interesting as Tony Kushner's play on Afghanistan that opens with a lengthy monologue, riveting, that blossoms into a dull play. Here the monologue ends. Hare spares us the dull play."
2,(see my review sent two weeks ago),"1. I have sent you two reviews of this book in the past 3 weeks.The first, you reported to me, was too ad hominem.I fixed that up and 2 weeks ago sent a second version.You still are exercising censorship and not publishing my review of ""Via Dolorosa"" of Dvid Hare.Interesting that you quickly pulished my 1st review sent to you - of ""Archyology"".The last review I sent you was purely non-personal and all referred to the book. I gave the two parts of the book: 2 stars and 5 stars. The two parts are totally unconnected.Where's my review?Dr. Baruch Hurwich hurwich@cc.huji.ac.il"
2,"Very poor ""Via Dolorosa""; excellent ""When Shall We Live"".","To the Editor of accepted book reviews:I find most interesting your immediate acceptance of my review of don marquis' ""Archyology"", which you have left on-line and which represents my true feelings about the book. Yet, I twice wrote a review of David Hare's book, ""Via Dolorosa and Wnen Shall We Live"". I split my grading of the book into 5 stars for the second half, and 2 stars for the first and overall. I did NOT write ad hominem, but rather described what I believe are real flaws and errors in ""Via Dolorosa"".Why didn't you accept it? Is it bad for merchandising?I am a regular and enthusiastic Amazon customer and tell all my friends about you.I'll also tell them about your rejection of my review, with no obvious reason for it.I would appreciate your response.Thank you.Dr. Baruch Hurwich hurwich@cc.huji.ac.il"
4,Very good bag!,"I bought this bag for my 15"" late 2008 Macbook Pro because I didn't want to carry it around in my backpack. This bag is very convenient and very useful. The only downside are the attachment hooks. They are very annoying. Every time that you move around and push the bag so it turns and twist, the hooks make a very annoying squeak noise. While it's not that big of a deal, the fact that it happens each and every time is annoying. Otherwise, this bag is amazing for what it claims to do."
5,Lowepro Laptop briefcase,I love it. I got it for my Mac Book Pro and It fits great like a well made glove. I really like all of low pro's products and gear. I have many bags so I decided to keep the Low pro line from my camera bags to my Laptop bag. I highly recommend this bag/briefcase. built well and loos great and plenty of room for the charger and small book and 3 flash drives 5 business cards and a Droid cell phone :)!
1,Lacking...,"This book is terrible. Examples are very poorly written, shows example and then solution with no work to show how answer was obtained. The answer key only provides answers to even problems, and only even numbered problems that have solely numerical answers (no graphs, words, etc.) No other answer key available for purchase. You would think by the Sixth Edition the author's would have perfected a student friendly text."
4,suburban secrets,New Joe Sarno.I'd never heard of Joe Sarno till 18 months ago.Now I am a fan.His 1970's films such as Butterflies and Abigail Leslie are great fun.Unfortunately Suburban Secrets is not quite the same.It is a bit too long.The sexual scenes are obviously simulated and there is a bit too much girl girl for my liking.The packaging includes a shortened version but I haven't got round to watching it yet.There is some delightful viewing just the same. 4 stars
3,You get what you pay...,"This laptop came with passwords installed. Took me 2 days to make passwords go away and the 'secure' passwords did conflict with fingerprint security software. This machine is still showing as it belongs to the seller. The machine is in good physical condition, however, seller never 'cleaned' past users settings/passwords to set the machine ready for the next user. Windows and thinkpad software was not updated for a long period of time. After I cleaned this clutter and updated the system with windows and thinkpad software, it is finally working as normal. It just runs hot, sometimes very hot. Battery lasts 2-3 hrs depending upon task. Bulging battery pack makes it less portable. I just use it for checking email and surf the web while I am in bed."
5,THIS IS A MUST HAVE !!!!,"I never thought I would love ranchero music,but after buying this CD,I cuoldn't understand why I didn't like it earlier.If you are getting into Alejandro Fernandez, I highly recommend this for an evening of love and romance."
5,Alejandro's the best !,"I know many would agree that this is the most beautiful voice on the planet, and here's another CD to prove it. Recorded in '96, with rousing rancheras like ""Es La Mujer"" and ""Ya Se Que Dices"", this is the most traditional of his recordings. The highlight for me is the Julio Iglesias/Rafael Ferro Garcia ""Abrazame""...it's sublime. This is more than great singing, it's pure artistry. As with his other CDs, this entire package is wonderfully designed, with easy to read lyrics and information, and of course, gorgeous photos !"
5,Muy Bueno...,"Since a Mexican friend of mine introduced me to Alejandro's songs, I have been hooked! If you are looking for something alegre or romantico - you can never ever go wrong with Alex. He so rocks! He just sets the perfect tone. I can't help but sing along with him. ;)"
2,A BONE TO PICK,"I have a bone to pick with this book. Although it presents itself as an overview of dyslexia, it is really an advertisement for the Davis Method. The first half of the book discusses ""standard"" treatments in a slightly negative way, then the second half of the book is a glowing explanation of the Davis method. I have nothing against Ron Davis's method but it's wrong for the book to be advertised as a general book when it's really a book about the Davis method."
3,A true documentary book,"This book is a ""documentary book"" in the most literal meaning of the words. It is a book of documents and speeches collected together in chronological order with little or no commentary. No analysis is performed and no opinions are expressed. It just lays out the documents, starting with the Balfour declaration, and on to many letters and documents preceding the declaration of independence. It then follows up with transcripts of speeches and further documents by arab and israeli leaders. This book would be interesting to someone who already knows a lot about the issues and just wants to ""use the source"". Some of the most important documents are very abridged (the book is long enough as it is) so if you are looking for something specific - you may not find it. On the other hand, you can gain some insights from this book which are very hard to get through more ""opinionated"" books. It took me many months to get through this book, as I would just read a few paragraphs a day."
2,Not good,"I thought that the full head framer Hitachi gun was sub-par compared to other guns. I am a avid lover of Hitachi tools, and I thought that this particular gun was not up to Hitachi's standards for a quality tool. I purchased this gun and returned it immediatly. While other Hitachi guns are probably some of the best on the market, if you are looking for a full head framer I would highly suggest a different brand."
1,Used and Abused,"I purchased the used framing nailer to do remodel projects at home.I thought a used gun would work for my needs since projects are small and onlya couple of hours at a time.I was disappointed with the product and how it was advertised; it was advertised as having some scratches but works fine. Turned out, it had scratches that showed evidence of abuse and the gun does not work fine; it double-taps and needs repair.I am very unsatisfied with the product and wish I had purchase a new gun."
5,Hitachi Framing Nailer,This is an excellent nailer. Works very well. I like the depth adjustment and sequential firing of this nailer.
5,Not a Review But A Question On No Mar Nose Cap,Great framing nailer but it does not come with a rubber nose cap. Does anyone know where I can purchase on the internet the No Mar Nose Cap HIT2105 (Nose Cap / Tip) for the NR83A2 model? I use this gun for installing finished siding as well as general framing. I want to purchase about 6 of these.
5,Bought this item new for 225.00 @ Amazon,"The best part is I have equity in my nail gun lol I bought it in March of 2009 for $225.00 what a great dam deal. Doesn't get any better then this I'm a third generation carpenter, and we all have used this exact nail gun, except dads and grandpas was the older model NR83A. I cant remember the last time it has jambed up. Anybody that uses these Hitachi NR83A2 nail guns will tell you all about how great they work. A lot of guys like the original Hitachi NR83A but this one has the adjustable depth control right on the gun. There's not to may differences between the two besides this is the only one you can buy new still. What ever you do make sure if you want the adjustable depth control you get the Hitachi NR83A2 NOT THE NR83A2(S) because the model with the (s) doesn't have it. The (s) means surprise you got the wrong one. All and all don't look any further this is the gun you need I promise you won't be disappointed."
5,You get what you pay for,"I bought this gun from a local hardware store because I needed a nailer to help build my friends house, it's going on its second week of work and I can say that I like it so far, gun shoots smooth and has a nice feature to select single fire or sequential fire witch helps greatly nailing in a wide open field like nailing subfloors down or nailing up siding. The weight isn't to bad and feels nice in the hand, only thing that I did not like is that their is no hook on the gun although I do believe you can buy one as a accessory, every gun should have one built onto it, over all great gun!"
3,JT's Greatest,"Producer, CEO, rapper/emcee JT the Bigga Figga from the Bay Area's San Francisco, a place where 90% of slang comes from. JT's been independent for at least a decade putting it down with the Get Low Playaz representing the West Coast. ""Tha Fatha Figga"" featuring Snoop Dogg was weak with Snoop's alphabet rhymes. As for the fall with this and a lot of California's music is they don't have versitility nor unique sounds. I can't tell which song is which because the sleeve is in a wrong order. ""We Bout To Ball"" featuring San Quinn is a summertime jam to be played at the picnic and could have been a commercial success. E-40 and Celly Cell came through to add some flavor to ""Beware Of Those"" which turned out to be a good song featuring artist from another California city like ""City Town To The LBC"" featuring Swoop G. JT has talent, but once he realize that he need to think outside his box he'll be major."
5,This game is tight!!!,This is one of the best Hip Hop cd's I have ever heard. With great beats and tight lyrics! I recommend this to all rap fans.
3,Not a definitive reference,This book has a lot of valuable insights in the Maintenance process for the software made with the traditional third-generation programming tools and languages. The book gives especially good practical advises for the transition activities. The chapter that deals with the Maintainability disappointed me. It contains just links to another sources of information without mentioning a single rule about how to evaluate the maintainability of software. The part of the book that concerns the Object Oriented software maintenance is also very poor.The book shares the common problem with the majority of technical books : redundant inflated text.
1,Useless Index,"I'm all for buying digital books but I can't believe digital page numbers are used in place of actual page numbers on any college book. What good is the index if the page numbers don't match up? Unless I'm missing something, this seems absolutely ridiculous."
5,GREAT!,"again, I purchased it as a ""like new"" item, and it really was ""like new""! I love Perales and I love my record!!"
2,"Same thing set in a ""Templar"" time","Well. Nothing very interesting was presented. There was not enough background information to really set the story. So, while it was the classic formula romance, it lacked interest for me."
1,Others have done the templar story better,"A tired, tedious read. Very difficult to finish. I finally skipped ahead to see the end."
4,"good to have on DVD, but could be better","Don't get me wrong -- I loved the original ""Experience"" movie, back when it was available on VHS. But I expected great things with its move to DVD -- the quality of the sound of this release is clean, but the video quality of the first 25 minutes is somewhat grainy and disappointing.My favorite section of this DVD is the ""Number 9"" Swedish performance. It's in stellar quality -- I really wish that more of this show (all of it?) could have made this disc...given that there was plenty of room to add more 'filler'.The worst track (for me) was Jimi miming 'Hey Joe'. Sure it's cool to see, but once was enough for me. The ""Dolly Dagger"" video is tolerable, but I'd have preferred another concert clipping instead.The one positive note I should make, is that the version I purchased (through Bogus Buy) included two additional tracks from Jimi's forthcoming ""Blue Wild Angel"" DVD -- ""All Along the Watchtower"" and ""Spanish Castle Magic""."
3,An edited version of the original cinema release ?,"I remember seeing the original Experince movie when it first came out in 1968 and I'm sure it was much longer then. It seems to have been edited down by the Hendrix Estate which is a big pity. I'm not sure if any of the music has been cut but certainly some of the interviews are missing, particularly the unique Cynthia Caster Plaster interview. I wish I could find out the length of the original movie but unusually imdb.com does not have a lot of detail on this. Anyway, a unique record of how people saw Hendrix at the time in the Sixties.Better than Rainbow Bridge.But not as good as the Warner Bros Jimi Hendrix movie."
5,A TEETH PICKING EXTRAVAGANZA,"I 've told you before that I LOVE IT when hendrix picks with his teeth. Some great examples are shown on this Dvd. I wish that it were longer though. with all the unrealesed footage that Experience Hendrix has laying around, who knows what they're gonna come out with next? I wish that they would release the entire Berkeley concert on Dvd now that would be awesome! Berkeley to me was one of Jimi's best shows. But of course on Johhny B. Goode, They just had to edit it when Jimi was playing with his teeth and that to me is a NO NO!"
3,Good for historical purposes,"There are some good things in this collection. Live gems, the famous ""Hear My Train a Coming"" on acoutsic 12 string guitar, and some amusing interviews. But it is a bit disjointed at times.Be forewarned: the ""Dolly Dagger"" video is revolting. Insipid. Pitiful. Why Hendrix Experience LLC authorized this is beyond my understanding."
2,Get a Different Hendrix DVD,"This DVD is carelessly shot, often focussing on Jimi's face rather than his entire being. Show us his hands for crying out loud! That's where the action is. There is a really awkward version of Red House that the band performed at the height of the Jimi-Noel fights; the performance is capped by Jimi and the band walking off the stage in disgust.There are definately more interesting and entertaining Hendrix performances available, so check those out."
2,"An ""Experience"" to avoid","Again, I believed all the hype of never seen before footage and was disappointed. The first 15 to 20 minutes of this reissued video are awful. Not only was the footage bad, but they could have cleaned the negative before they released it. The qualilty of Wild Thing in Paris '67 was horrible, but once you got used to it, they procceded to cut it short.Red House and Sunshine of Your Love from the 1969 Sweden show are the only highlights of the video. They should have released the whole 1st and 2nd set of this show and then it would have been a worthwhile buy. I give it 2 stars since it was better than Fillmore East and Electric Ladyland videos."
1,Jimi Hendrix:Experience,"This DVD was a big disappointment. The only good track is ""Hey Joe"". Everything else is very bad. There are other bad Hendrix DVDs but this is the worst. If you want Hendrix on DVD, buy ""Woodstock"", ""Monteray Pop"" or ""Band Of Gypsys"". I'm trading in my copy soon."
4,EXPERIENCE HENDRIX,"EXPERIENCE HENDRIX,THIS IS AN OK DVD I DONT LIKE THE FACT THEY ADDED AN VIDEO OF HEY JOE AND DOLLY DAGGER THAT MADE THE DVD WORSEN. THE BEST HIGHLIGHTS FROM THIS DVD HAVE TO BE ALL THE CONCERT MATERIAL SOME OF IT IS RAW LIKE IN THE BEGGINING WHEN THEY PLAY PURPLE HAZE BUT IT GETS BETTER WHEN HENDRIX AND THE EXPERIENCE PLAY RED HOUSE IN SWEDEN AND SUNSHINE OF YOUR LOVE. THEY SHOULD HAVE ADDED THE FULL CONCERT INSTEAD OF CLIPS FROM THE CONCERTS. I RATED THIS 4 STARS ITS OK FOR ME IT WAS NOT A MUST HAVE HENDRIX RELEASE BUY IT AND YOU SEE HOW YOU LIKE IT."
5,Great stand,"I bought this stand on sale, it is a great stand, easy to assemble. and works very well. on sale it is worth the money."
2,Try again,"The stand, once assembled is great. The instructions suck! Some of the parts don't fit and have to be re-drilled. Assembly is a hassle but once together, the stand work well."
5,bill,"i like the stand, but i think dewalt could do better with the bolt, they had no shoulders all threads, so the wheels roll on the threads, the wheels will where out, maybe they will sent me the right bolts."
3,DeWalt DW7350 Planer Stand,"The assembly instructions are for a stand with a pre-assembled base, but the base isn't pre-assembled. Your best bet for assembly is to download the exploded parts view from DeWalt, after throwing the inept instructions away. The shoulder bolts for the plastic wheels are not supplied as shoulder bolts - they're all thread. I've tried getting a replacement from DeWalt, but they don't seem to know the difference. I suggest visiting a hardware store. The stand is ok once assembled."
1,You gotta be pulling my leg!,"Really Folks,I can understand how contractors could benefit from a lightweight portable metal stand. However, I can't see how anyone else could be so excited about this contraption. It is hardly inexpensive at $100. It's some bent sheetmetal and particleboard! Assuming access to a table saw and basic skills, anyone should be able to produce a more elegant and less costly solution. A plywood box with wheels will do that very well. Better yet would be to add a door and shelves for storage. Two hours working plywood beats one hour assembling sheetmetal with all the screws, washers, nuts, wrenches, instructions, etceteras. A plywood stand could be used to store the manual, replacement knives, knife changing tools, and extension cord to name a few. Let's get realistic!"
1,Amazon.com web site misleading,It turns out that orders placed by telephone can only be for items shipped directly from amazon. There is no mention of this on the web site in the location inviting you to order by telephone. The amazon price may well exceed the item advertized on the web page. This is very misleading and a form of bate and switch.
5,"Excellent product, a steal at the sale price of $107","Purchased the Dewalt planer at a woodworking show but not the table because of the cost, found it at Amazon for $107 which was $75 less then the discounted price at the woodworking show. This is a very nice table."
5,A solid stand,"Not a whole lot to say about this stand. It serves it's purpose just fine.This stand is plenty sturdy, and easy to wheel around. There is a foot lever for easy switching between wheeled mode and stationary, and an optional shelf for storing things under the planer.The top is MDF with predrilled holes for DeWalt 733,734, and 735 planers, though I used it for mounting a Makita planer(which required drilling my own holes of course). For the Makita planer particularly, this stand seems really bigger than it needs to be, but it's probably still a good thing since that wideness will help keep it from tipping over when you run a long heavy board through it.The assembly instructions were pretty vague and unhelpful in places, which made putting it together take a bit longer than it should have."
5,"DeWalt planer stand, good quality, as usual from DeWalt","I own several DeWalt power tools and have been pleased with the quality of their products. I bought this stand to use with a 12"" DeWalt planer I purchased several years ago and am very happy with the design and quality of the item. It is a sturdy stand similar to the stand for my DeWalt woodworkers table saw. My planer is now easy to move around and is rock-solid when the front caster is lowered for use."
5,Solid stand for most any planer,"Like other readers, I was hesitant about spending the money on this stand but after seeing how heavy my Delta 13"" planer was and how much it would cost later to get a stand + wheels, I decided to buy this one. This stand is solid! I don't have much room in my shop so the wheels are perfect to move it out of the way. The only drawback is the wheel you use to set it down or up (to move it). It's easier to install it on the outside but then it's easy for you to trip on it if you are not careful. This, however, is also a problem in many other mobile bases."
4,perfect stand,I received my planer stand promptly and well packaged in the original box. It was everything it said it was and works perfectly for my planer.
4,"Good stand, horrible instructions","Heed the advice of numerous other reviews and throw the instructions away! They were written by a technical writer who probably has a hard time with shoe laces. Some of the instructions are simply topologically impossible. Once you figure it out on you own, it goes together fairly quickly. Pieces are milled very accurately and nothing was missing from the hardware package. I might have designed the leg-base attachment differently to be a bit more substantial, but generally it's strong and moves easily around ths shop. But shame on DeWalt for not updating their instructions - a good writer could fix this in a couple hours, including detailed photos."
5,DeWalt Paner Stand,"This DeWalt Planer Stand is a little pricey, but it is worth every penney. Every thing fits together great and it is built very strong. If you have or buy the DeWalt two speed planer, BUY THIS STAND!"
5,Dewalt DW7350,"Shipped quick. Received in just a few days with regular shiping. Well made, easy to assemble and very sturdy. I purchased this stand for my 13"" Delta Planner. A good buy!"
1,Disappointed ... but problem possibly rectified.,"Defective product sent. Local company helped with the replacement. No opportunity to open box and inspect second one yet. Very disappointed in DeWalt. The first product looked substantial but the holes in the foundation of the table did not line up and this part of the table, per the directions, was suppose to come assembled. Very surprised that DeWalt let this one out...pleased that the return was honored...but wasted a lot of time on the first one before realizing that it was defective...also a lot of time returning the darn thing. It is very bulky and heavy and it was difficult to manipulate and transport. Great for its purpose, rough if needs to be returned.This product should be a great table when it is put together... as long as it is not defective."
2,"Poor instructions, poor quality","I don't agree with the assembly nor quality control indicated on previous reviews. The holes on one side had to be redrilled to fit. The wheel assembly is not obvious. Toss the instructions and preassemble and you would do better. Once assembled, it seems adequate. Dewalt quality is lacking on this product in my opinion."
3,DeWalt DW7350,"Bolts provided by DeWalt do not correspond with assembly instructions or drawings.Instead of shoulder bolts for the wheels, not correct all threaded bolts was supplied.Extra time and Home Depot was needed to complete assembly of DeWalt DW7350 mobile planer stand."
3,Quality control?,"This is a fairly decent stand, with a couple of issues. The actual base part was supposed to come preassembled but it wasn't. The bolt holes didn't line up exactly and I had to drill two out. The corners of the base are held together with one bolt each and there are no diagonal braces so it is difficult getting the base square. My final issue is that the bolts supplied for attaching the planer are a full inch too short so now I have to drive an hour and a half to town just to get 4 correctly sized bolts. I'm a little disappointed with the lack of quality control. I expect more from DeWalt."
2,poorly made,I returned the product because it was poorly made. I could not assemble it as the holes did notalign in the base so I could insert the bolts. The instructions said the base would be preassembledand it was not. Very disappointed in Dewalt as they normally they sell quality products.
5,Went together easy.,"Opened the box and everything was there. Assembly instructions weren't the best, but the parts explosion from DeWalt site helped tremendously. Basically, just started from the bottom and built up. No missing parts. All holes aligned perfectly. QC must be getting better. Assembly time was about 2 hours."
4,Excellent quality,Don't even read instructions. They are very difficult to follow.Use the pictures and common sense. If you can't do that you should not own aPlaner anyway.
3,great stand except for the assembly,"I would give a 5 star rating except for two problems in the assembly instructions. First I do not recommend mounting the foot pedal inside the frame. You cannot get to it with your foot. Secondly the longest bolts do NOT mount the wheels. Instead use the next shorter ones provided. The longest bolts are what work to mount the planer to the stand.One last item, I also purchased the extention plates. It would have been nice to know in the stand assembly instructions the planer cannot be mounted to the stand BEFORE you install the extentions.The above mis-information added about two extra frustrated hours to assembly."
3,DeWalt 735 Mobile Planer Stand,"This is a very substantial stand for the 735 planer. The package comes complete with all of the nuts, bolts, washers, and screws needed for proper assembly. The overall workmanship is excellent (no unfinished or rough edges or corners - a typical fine DeWalt product).The negative aspects of this stand involve the lack of coherent directions for assembly. All of the nuts and bolts are metric (no mention of this in the assembly instructions), the assembly of the footstand for elevating the entire planer stand is left to the imagination of the assembler, the placement of the feet is vague, and the length of the shoulder and carriage bolts in the various applications is left to trial and error.Making the assembly instructions more user-friendly would greatly enhance the rating level of this product."
4,Great Stand! Instructions need work,"The stand is very solid and well built, aside from some errors in the instructions it went together quickly.There were a couple of problems with the instructions:1) The nuts and bolts in my kit required a 13mm socket & wrench, NOT the 1/2"" stated in the directions.2) The pictures of the bolts and the instructions are misleading. The shorter bolts should be used to attach the wheels and the foot pedal assembly and the longer ones are needed to mount the Dewalt 735 planer to the top. The instructions show them the other way around."
3,Just OK,"My DeWalt planer stand had the bad luck to arrive and be assenbled just after a Kreg tool stand. The two stands cost about the same and there the similarity ends. The Kreg was heavily built, with much more steel in every piece. The DeWalt was much lighter. The Kreg had a few extra bolts 'just in case' whereas the DeWalt was short one nut. The wheels on the DeWalt are crap. Now truthfully the wheels for the Kreg are an extra, and pricey at $45 a set - but the ones on the DeWalt are worthless. The DeWalt hangs up on every chip on the floor while the Kreg wheels around effortlessly. The DeWalt is consumer grade while the Kreg is a piece of professional equipment. I've ordered another Kreg stand and will find a light-duty use for this DeWalt as I can't stand working with cheesy gear."
5,Powerful table,"If you have a planer, you definitely need this table. Very study and holds up under extreme pressure. GREAT!!!"
5,Very nice product,"This table fit the bill exactly for me. The base was not put together as advertised, but using another reviewers advice, I looked up the diagram at Dewalt's site and didn't have any trouble putting it together. All the nuts and bolts are packaged and labeled in groups as to their use and that made it very easy to put together. Also, I wasn't sure the lower table would be included as I didn't see it in the pictures, but it is."
3,good product; terrible assembly instructions,"Although the stand itself seems sturdy once assembled, I agree with the other reviewers who criticized DeWalt's wholly inadequate assembly instructions. As others have stated, the instructions assume the base comes preassembled, although that is not the case. Because of this error, there are no instructions for assembling the base. The parts used to assemble the base are not sufficiently identified and must be determined through a process of elimination. If you purchase this stand, I suggest that you go to the following page on DeWalt's website to see an exploded view of the stand:[...]This should help with your assembly."
4,Nice table,"once I threw out the assembly instructions it went together easily, there were several parts that the directions were preassembled that were not. One of the predrilled holes did not line up perfectly but other than that does everything expected."
5,Should have had this stand right when I bought the planer three years ago,"Like a previous customer, I should have had this stand years ago. It has the right size & height, is heavy duty & is very mobile. The only drawback is a minor one... The bolts that are to be used to mount the planer on the stand are waaaaay too short to work with the dw734 & I surmise that if the 733 uses the same metal base it would have the same problem. It was an easy fix though.... Drill the holes out to 3/8"" & use 3/8"" bolts & nuts. (or go buy metric bolts)"
4,Good Table / Poor Instructions,"This product is sturdy and well made (as is almost all DeWalt products). However, the instructions must have been written by a 5th grader. First it tells you to mount the wheels and brackets to the ""pre-assembled"" frame. Well the frame is not pre-assembled and if you mount the wheel brackets you have to remove one carriage bolt to mount the corner upright. Also, the bolts are packages with labels indicating where they are to be used in the assembly. If you follow the instructions you will end up with four bolts that are too short to mount the planer to the table. I read another review that encountered the same problem and they realized that the bolts marked for the wheel assembly are the ones you should use for the planer mount. I didn't realize this and went to the hardware store and bought longer 5/16"" bolts to mount the planer. Not a big deal, just an annoyance."
1,Incorrect parts for asembly for Dewalt 7350 Planer Stand,"The product assembly instructions do NOT match shipping contents. Researched Dewalt 7350 reviews at Dewalt site, apparrently this is an ongoing problem. I contacted Dewalt Customer service and will now drive 4 hours round trip to see if they can correct problem. Do not buy this product. I guess this explains the big discounts offered from Amazon."
3,Wheels are a pain!,This would be a nice cart if the wheels and lifting set up would work better. The rubber feet are so close to the floor when the unit is lifted that even a thin piece of carpet or floor mat catches on them and makes it difficult to move the unit. I will put better wheels on mine.
1,Worst piece of crap I've purchased!,"I finally got around to unpacking and assembling my new planer stand. First off I would like to say that the instruction sheet was the worst I've ever encountered; very little detail and few photos. I still can't figure out how the foot pedal operates and what are the two holes in the foot pedal for? Also, holes didn't match up and holes were actually missing. I had a lot of adjustments to make and additional holes to drill. Very disappointing!"
4,DEWALT DW7350 Planer Stand with Integrated Mobile Base,A must if you own the DEWALT Planer. It allows me to move the planer around with ease.
2,Not impressed,"I received one of these in a package deal at a Woodcraft store. I was happy that I was getting a nice stand for my planer. Then I opened the box and started reading what they called ""instructions"". The instructions I received showed that the base was one piece, mine was in 4 pieces. The bolts provided for the wheels have a full threaded shank. This will ware the plastic wheels out in short order. I ended up using the hold down bolts for the planer for the wheels. This of course left me with only two bolts for the planer.I planed both sides of 16 2x4's yesterday. The stand seems solid enough once together. It's just overly complicated to assemble.Oh and the lifting wheel lever is backward. What asshat factory worker put that thing together?"
4,Great product though tight,"Bought this one looking at the style and will give 5* for it. But it's kinda tight in the lace area when you try to put it on. Basically the mouth of the shoe is kinda small for your foot to go in, but once you wear it, then it's OK. However, your foot might pain a li'll if you wear it for a long time. It's not only true during the ""break-in"" period, but even after you've worn it for a couple of times.But it's elegant, stylist 'n classy. It goes with informals as well as formals. Best suited with blue denims or cordroys, anything that's fit at the ankle. I don't think it's a good match with ""lose at bottom"" trousers.Oh.. BTW.. I paid $29.89 for them"
2,You get what you pay for.,Shoes look nice and are comfortable. Just don't expect any of the Unlisted branded shoes to last very long. The stitching is weak and the soles tend to come unglued.
2,"A failed experiment , poorly produced","European audiences have seen the classics (such as Der Freischutz) too many times. Instead of traditional productions, European opera houses feel the need to add something different in an attempt to make the old new and interesting.Usually this fails, as it does in this production. Although there are some new elements I didn't mind, the added elements here were annoying and distracting.Der Freischutz is the kind of opera that I want one copy of in my collection, but this isn't it. When I come across a more traditional production I'll have to get it.There are few exciting DVD features. Simply subtitles in English, French or Japanese. The visual quality is poor - you can see the ""digital squares"" during the darker scenes (and there are many!)."
1,annoying stage production,"A good director can certainly make an opera more interesting and enjoyable by adding unusual touches, especially when they are done gracefully. Unfortunately, in this production the bizarre changes make no sense, and as far as I can tell, their only purpose is to draw attention to the stage director. Instead of enjoying the opera, I find myself just getting more and more distracted. I doubt I?ll ever watch this annoying production again. What a pity. The opera Der Freischutz belongs in any desert island collection."
2,Apparently this is no joke,"A bizarre warped conceit of a production. Weber would be too stunned to roll over in his grave. I love this opera and here the singing is fine, as is the orchestral playing, and the sound. The costumes are tolerable as well. But was that an elevator going up in the middle of the overture, a character mooning the audience, and the cover of a men's fitness magazine being waved around seemingly to symbolize amorous attraction? Infantile stuff just too clever for its own silly good. Did I hear boos at the end for the director? Deserved every one of them. And more."
2,"A ""For Dummys"" book for experts","Nicely written, good structure and flow. But lots of books will give you that.The thing that lets this book down is the examples. The text will be explaining some technique, and there are often ""Before and after"" photos to illustrate the results - Great, you think. But the photos do not really illustrate what is being demonstrated. Try as I might, I cannot see the differences. In one case where you can actually see a difference, it is so slight and subtle as to be very hard to see.Maybe the author can see the differences, but a Dummy can't! And that's why we buy a Dummies book. Because we are not experts.My advice - choose a different book. And check it out first."
5,Was For My Son,It looks as if it will be a good book for my son. He loves to read as much as I do to read books
5,A Heartwarming and Inspiring Read,"I love this book! With a beautiful, spare style, this author has given us a moving and inspiring holiday story. And, for anyone who remembers the old Harvard Square (before it became a shopping mall), they will find it here! I predict that Grace will become a new holiday classic, a book people will read year after year during the holiday season. I know I will."
2,Time for Dewalt to address the blade problem.,"Like what nearly everyone else says, the DW 735 is a great planner, but the heart of the machine, the lousy blades are a problem that must be dealt with. Dewalt's reputation is on the line, it's time they addressed the problem and came up with better blades."
1,Poor manufacturing/QA controls,"I have had two sets of blades sent to me by Infinity Tools. The first set had alignment hole issues; off center by .015 inches. I had to wait 4 months for replacements. Then the second set had end to end taper of .025 to .030 inches. Can't get flat results, let alone any blade life, with one edge doing all the cutting. I went back to DeWalt for close tolerance product."
2,the good and the bad,"Like others have said this an excellent piece of equipment with a fatal flaw. The blades turn into so much junk very quickly. Especially if you do more than take off a more than a 64th or so regardless of species. That said until the blades wear out it is a spectacular planer. It leaves a very clean finish and very little if any snipe. I only use it on a few specific situations and leave all of the real planing to my 26"" bridgewood with a helical carbide insert head. If only there were good relatively inexpensive aftermarket carbide knives. Infinitytools makes them but they cost anywhere from $200-250 a set. I don't know about anyone else, but that's a heck of a lot of money for carbide knives. Granted they can be resharpened a couple of times, but I can replace all 130 sumodd of the carbide inserts on my helical head for almost half of that."
1,De walt Shame on you,"Its the same story as others have said, 200 BF of hardwoods is all you will get out of these chinese blades. I guess the china men haven't perfected sheffield steel yet. I just bill my customers 50 bucks a project for the cost of me being stupid enough to buy another dewalt product/."
3,Usual Blade quality,I ordered these because of the price. It's the usual Dewalt quality and the blades don't last long. It's alright for light duty
2,I scewed up!,Sure wish I would have checked on blade replacement prior to purchase of the DeWalt Planer DW 735.It is pretty hard to fathom that DeWalt has not corrected this situation.It is a competative world and they seem not to be worried.Anyone out there want to purchase a DW 735 planer? Mine is for sale at a good price.
2,The toner cartridges of woodworking,"Yes, like toner cartridges, these blades don't last long and forever need replacing. For that reason I sold my DW735 and switched back to a DW733...I could not afford the blade habit! If you use exotics, or simply use your planer a lot, I would not recommend the DW735, as they obviously switched to non-sharpenable blades in order to hook you on their VERY overpriced replacements. If you get 3-400 BF out of a set, consider yourself lucky!"
1,with I hadn't bought this machine.,The blades wear out quickly can't be sharpened and are expensive. Whet else is there to say.
4,pretty good planer,The planer by itself is a great machine. The blades come very sharp and seem to last fairly well and are reversable which helps. They do seem to be a little pricy however
4,"Good quality, not-so-compact","I ordered these brushes to pack in my overnight bag, as I travel often, and was always in fear of leaving my beloved Bobbi Brown brushes in some random hotel room. The quality is very good, and the brushes work quite well. I was a bit disappointed, however, with the size of the case; while, like the brushes, it is very well-made and aesthetically pleasing, it is a bit large (IMO) for traveling. Those who do not find space (or lack thereof) in their beauty bag an issue will likely appreciate that this brush case has ample room for a compact and perhaps other small items inside."
5,Silently We Defend,"Dear Readers, My name is Robert Benfer, the author of ""Silently We Defend."" I would like to invite all of you visit my new web site at: http://www.geocities/silentlywedefend for more information on the book, its characters, and additional photographs from Desert Storm that are not in the book.Sincerely,Robert Benfer"
4,a soldier's view of the war,"More than being a detailed examination of the Gulf War, this book gave a picture of the war as seen by a small group of soldiers. Not being from the military myself, I found their daily routine interesting and their challenges exceptional. And at times, the image that this is a group of ordinary folks in an extraordinary situation - shines through. I recommend the book from that context."
5,Silently We Defend gives a behind the scenes look at warfare,"Benfer does an excellent job of conveying the duties of electronics warfare specialists in the Army during Operation Desert Storm. This work is thorough in relating what took place in the ARCENT TCAE during the first Gulf War, and those of us who were part of identifying targets to protect our frontline troops and pilots took great pride in what we did.Benfer is precise in relating these events and the equipment and methods used.A must read for those who are history or military buffs!!!!!Penny and crew give it two thumbs up!"
5,The best book for understanding database programming with VB,"I have read several books on VBA and Visual Basic, but this book was by far the best and most educational book I have ever read on visual basic. Most books don't even demonstrate real business situations, but Jeffrey McManus describes the best approaches and methods for using VB for a business. This is the book that I have been waiting so long for, and it was defanitly worth the wait. After reading this book, I was finally able to understand what my other visual basic books were talking about. It makes understanding methods and sub routines very easy. If you love VB and database, this is by far the best book for you."
4,hitachi cordless drill,this is a great product . it has me beat why you stuffed me around so much.try to pick up your act!
5,20 minutes to mental clarity,"In the 20 minutes it took to read this book, I changed my view of the world. The world mankind perceives, it explains, is a product of the mind. There is no need to hate anything, doubt anything, worry about anything. You are defining it second by second through your senses. That said, focus on the present, Chopra teaches. Watch the unfolding world like a show, for that's all it is. It is a good show, a show to love, a show to learn from, but a show, happily. No stress. No heavy lifting....a real eye opener"
3,A Walk-Through Meditation,"I purchased this book with no knowledge of its contents other than what what Amazon.com had listed for it.When I sat down to read it I flipped through the pages in dismay as the everything seemed to be sentences of no-brainer content. It wasn't until later in the book that I discovered that the beginning ""no-brainer""-isms were a process in the book to begin a walk-through meditation.At the ""Aaah...I get it...it's a meditation"", the book was much more enjoyable, but only when it came to light that it was from that perspective that it should probably be read.As a walk-through meditation, it was enjoyable and uplifting. The journey was full of positive affirmations.For me it was a relaxing experience. The content didn't particularly include anything that struck an epiphany of any sort, and certainly the book and its content and messages are directed to a Pagan audience."
2,needs the figures (makes more sense with pictures),I had to go find another publication since the figures did not display on my kindlefire. With the pictures the analogies he provides make sense.
4,A nice addition to your kitchen,"I love this steamer, but it arrived damaged (part of one of the handles was cracked in half). It is still usable, but yeah, not how I wanted to receive my item. I have cooked veggies and meat in the steamer and it works wonderfully. I would still recommend it!"
4,strong image analysis,"Guzdial teaches Python from the angle that you want to use it to easily manipulate various types of multimedia files. The files might contain images, sounds, video or even just plain text. This gives some of you extra motivation to learn the material.Along the way, you can learn how images are encoded in JPG, and how colours are represented, either in RGB or HSB. There is a fair amount of image analysis and modifications that can be easily done in Python. This does not approach the sophistication of what Photoshop provides. But being able to do a lot yourself, instead of invoking canned Photoshop routines, might appeal to you.Audio manipulation is also covered, though perhaps not as extensively. There are more specialised audio tools available elsewhere, especially for music synthesis.The discussion of movies is very weak. Due to the complexity of what is required. Here I suggest you turn to what Apple and others offer."
4,Hand and Foot Club,"I bought the shufflers for the girls in my Hand & Food Club. Some of them have arthritis and have difficulty shuffling cards with their hands. The shufflers are a great (however, noisy) solution. They love them."
5,6 deck card shuffler,"I love it, it makes playing cards with a bunch of people much easier and faster, the only down fall of it is it is very noisy but all in all a great product."
3,Check as soon as you get it,"Our family has used these for years although they don't last for years! They are cheaply made but do the job. I unfortunately ordered a replacement, and it sat for just over a month - went to use it and it doesn't work. It's past the window to return! So check when you get it and don't expect it to last you years. Maybe one ;-)"
3,Gets the job done.,It's a bit flimsey. Probably not good for a bunch of kids but it works nicely for us retired folks.
4,I like it,We play with five decks of cards and the shuffler makes it so much faster to shuffle now and get to the next hand.
2,Arrived broken and non working,"Second one we ordered, gave the last one away. This arrived as promised, packaging was in good order. However when we took it out of the box it was broken. The clear card slide had a big crack in it and one of the guides was busted off. We went ahead and put batteries in it and tried to shuffle several decks of cards. They would not shuffle. It was as if something was missing. Contacted Amazon and set up a return. Will get another one soon and hopefully it works better than this one."
2,Too short return policy,"I ordered 3 shufflers, two for gifts and one for replacement of one I own. Two of them are so slow, they're useless (no matter how fresh the batteries). Now I find out return window ended Jan. 31--they were Christmas presents. Give me a break!"
1,Product was defective,"When I got the shuffler, I put batteries in and went to play cards with some friends. We loaded the cards, and only one side of the shuffler worked. So I returned it. I will have to go thru the hassle of getting another one. Hopefully, the next one works."
4,Worth the $,"I bought this shuffler because I play alot of card based table games (Munchkin mainly)with friends n family. With the expansions to the game, the deck grew to around 600 cards. And that takes a while to shuffle by hand between games. This I can do all of the cards within 2 minutes 3-4 times over. Saves alot of time for sure. The spring on the card slide is about the only thing that I would improve. It's a bit uneven. But other than that, this was money well spent."
4,"works well for the money, nice for 6 decks","I've had a number of these. They're plastic and not really that tough; but fo rthe cost they work fine, and I would buy one of them again."
1,Card Shuffler,This is the second one I have purchased. They seem to work for a few weeks and then either one side doesn't work or they don't work at all. I have several friends who have purchased one also (we play a card game using 6 decks) and they have the same problem.
3,The card shuffler shuffle,When you get one that works it works well and makes shuffling multiple decks a breeze. (Amazon very good at sending replacemnets until you get one that works.
1,CASINO POKER 6-CARD AUTOMATIC CARD SHUFFLER,"very disappointed in the quality of this ""automatic"" card shuffler. Did not work on the right side from the get go and does not handle 6 decks well at all.WOuld return it if it wasn't such a hastle. Poor quality workmanship in the ""automatic"" shuffler."
1,Eats batteries!,"I have had this shuffler for just over 30 days and have gone through 4 sets of ""C"" batteries which are anything but cheap. Would not recommend!!!!!"
1,doesn't work,Length:: 0:42 MinsI need to return this product. The cards do not shuffle. I have bought two or three of these exact shufflers in the past as gifts and they normally work great. The one I have does not feed the cards through hardly at all. Sounds as though some of the gears are stripped when you activate it.
2,2 of 3 ok,"I ordered 3 of these for friends. One did not shuffle at all. As of today, one has not been tested and one worked."
4,6-deck card shuffler,"Good product - Good price! The only problem I have found is that when the cards get a little worn, shuffling efficiency suffers a great deal. Saves a lot of work manually shuffling a number of decks."
5,Relief for hands,"For the price, this works great. My hands and arms hurt after shuffling for Hand and Foot over a long weekend, so I was looking for relief. This was it. A few glitches with cards getting hung up, but much better than shuffling by hand."
3,You get what you pay for...,"For the $12.95 I paid for it, I'm fairly happy. Kudos to Amazon for shipping it quickly!When the product arrived, one side didn't work. Rather than send it back, we did a little investigating and decided to try to fix it ourselves. We took it apart (some reviews said it was glued together - not true...I think there were 12 screws total) and quickly found the problem: one of the connections had come apart (the soldering wasn't very good), so we wrapped it up with electrical tape and voila! it works.There was NO identifying company information, instructions or anything. Just a box with the machine. It is made of cheap plastic, yes, but what do you expect for the price? For the money, I think it's great!"
4,Card Shuffler,Use it all the time. I play alot of card games so this works out great...was great to give as a gift..every one here in Ohio like them..
1,Junk,"Never worked. The gears that push the cards through stuck on one side, so you had to hold the top clear plastic piece to make the cards shoot to the bottom tray. It makes a huge racket. Do not waste your money."
4,My mother really enjoy's the automatic car shuffler.,It is easy to use and low maintainence. Was a little hard to figure it out in the beginning but finally did. Would tell anyone who plays cards alot that this is a must to have.
1,Casino 6 deck automatic card shuffler,"I used it once and then it stopped working. As I am out of town and do not have any info with me I was unable to send it back. Also, there were no directions so we had to take a lot of time trying to got it to work.Rae"
4,Card shuffler,"The shuffler certainly speeds things up, especially when we play hand & foot with 6 decks. And it shuffles more thoroughly than shuffling by hand. The only negative I have found so far is the two sides do not shuffle evenly. I have to put a few more cards on the right side so the two sides are finished at about the same time."
1,Thought they couldn't make it cheaper-I was wrong!,"Our club uses 6 deck shufflers and I thought I would save a couple of bucks by getting them from Amazon instead of the local flea market. How can you make a product cheaper than cheap? Well they did. This batch had thinner plastic and flaky gears resulting in very poor operation. I have 4 of these type shufflers in the workshop (all broken) trying to piece together one that works. These type of shufflers barely work, and only for a limited time. Don't waste your money. Cheap-Cheap-Cheap junk. I would be willing to pay more for a decent one but as much as I have searched I have not found one. The next step up is a $[...] unit that only shuffles one deck!"
4,good,"Two of the three shufflers had to be returned because of defects. One had a broken spring, the other one had a broken plastic gear. They were replaced with no problem."
2,Card Shuffler,"The 6-deck automatic card shuffler does not work as I expected. One side of it jams up, so you end up only shuffling one pile, which means you're not shuffling. We were shuffling four decks of cards and ended up doing it by hand."
1,"Junk, stay far away!","I received this as a gift, and I've been needing one desperately as I have a number of card games with over 200 cards each. The first time I used it, the right side stuck, so I'd have to feed them through. Then the ribbed plastic thing wouldn't work to depress the switch (it kept slipping). I've had to use my fingers to push the lever down to shuffle and, guess what, it snapped in half. And I've had it exactly 2 weeks. I'm sending it back, and the worst part is that I had to tell the friend who bought it for me. I'm getting a different one."
4,Casini 6-deck automatic cards shuffler,"Group of our neighbors in our community enjoy playing ""CANASTA"" cards game each week.This Automatic card shuffler is a fine addition to shuffling 5 to 6 decks of cards for each game.Before this we had to shuffle the cards by hand. For the price I would certainly recommend thisautomatic shuffler. Only problem if dropped would break the plastic parts."
1,Very cheap - in price and quality.,This thing is a piece of garbage. Cards get stuck consistently and it does a lousy shuffle. i will be returning it.
2,Card Shuffler,Am pleased with the performance of the shuffler but unfortunately the battery compartment cover keeps falling off. It doesn't affect the operation but is a irritation.
1,did not work,"After receiving the card suffler, I tried to suffle cards with very little success. One side worked while the other side did not work.I was not able to suffle cards. This makes the product useless.I am dissatisfied with the card suffler."
2,hit and miss!,"Sometimes this shuffler works okay and sometimes it hardly works at all. A little frustrating, half the time we end up still hand shuffling. Very finicky!"
4,If you are shuffling six decks this is the only way to go,"We have gone through a half dozen of these shufflers, but they are inexpensive. I once purchased a six deck shuffler for over $100 and it didn't do any better than this. The price for these on Amazon is all over the place. I once ordered one of the cheapest I could find on Amazon and a second for around $24 - they were the same machine."
1,works poorly,The shuffler flips cards over several times during one shuffle so that we have several cards rightside up when we draw. This is disconcerting when playing. It also jams often and we have to stop and unjam it before we can finish shuffling. The only good things I can say about this shuffler is that it does handle four decks with ease and its easier to deal with these problems than to shuffle four decks by hand.
1,naws,This product is nothing but junk. I tried to use it and it did not even last thru one card game before it stopped working. It would cost more to return it than it is worth. I will just have to buy one at a local store instead of from Amazon. Bad product you should be ashamed to sell it.
2,crappy,"You can't put more than 20 cards on the left side or it won't turn the cards in.For spending $20.00 to get this and give it as a gift, I am very disappointed in it."
3,Does not work well. Broken parts upon arrival,The Card holders are too deep. I did not realize how hard it would be to draw or discard the cards. A better choice would of been a 4 deck holder.The Shufflers --- two of them had broken parts but it would of cost too much to return them so we kept them. We can used them but we have to hold on to the clear plastic guide as the cards are being shuffled. The plastic part that holds the guide is broken off on one side.One of them does not shuffle well. The right side shuffles much faster than the left side. Plus the batteries do not fit well. The springs have to be adjusted to have a connection for the shuffler to work.
3,Cheaply made,"Cheaply made. I got this after I purchased a 2 deck one, and this is a no name brand, and made much cheaper. It takes 4 C batteries also."
2,Card Shuffler,"Not as good as it looks. The cards get stuck, the shuffle isn't even and the clear plastic accumulation plate is flimsy."
3,card shufflers,"We like the card shufflers however, we noticed that one side doesn't pull the cardsthrough as fast as the other side, Is one of the wheels lower? We noticed thison all of the shufflers."
3,It's OK...,"Works, but is of poor quality. Would be willing to pay a bit more to buy a product that was sturdier. We bought two...one as a gift, and one to keep. Small tab on each was broken, but did not affect the workings. We'll see how long they last!"
2,breaks too easy,These shufflers are great for alot of cards but this is the third one we have purchased and they continue to break in different areas for different reasons.
3,Sluggish,"The first shuffled I received would not work at all. Unfortunately, this shuffler is not like similar ones I've purchased at game stores. It works fine but seems ""tired"" already."
5,love it,"I am a terrible shuffler, whether it be one or six decks (we play ""hand and foot"", which requires a deck per person plus one extra, so typically the 4 of us play. And we use 5 decks of cards). Very loud though works very well."
1,Didn't Work,2 of the 3 ordered did not work. These were gifts and had purchased before and they worked fine. Straight out of the box the 2 didn't work is why rating a one star.
1,IT WAS VERRY BAD!!!!!!!!,It was bad when I got it broke and pieces were missing it was bad batteries wouldn't fit it really stunk.
1,Cheap. You get what you pay for.,"I purchased this shuffler because it had gotten good reviews. It came with no instrutions and was clearly very cheaply made. It doesn't work to shuffle new cards. The cards get jammed and won't feed through the shuffler. Plus, it's very loud. If shipping wasn't so much, I'd return it. Instead we threw it out."
2,Ungh...,It doesn't shuffle well. The cards get stuck and sometimes go all over the place. I use it for shuffling white cards against humanity cards and i must say I'm very disappointed.
4,CARD SHUFFLER,"I WOULD RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT, IT SHUFFLES THE CARDS WELL AND HAVE USED IT FOR A LONG TIME, WELL WORTH THE MONEY"
3,It's ok,"It's plastic, and works well, but it looks like it will break any time. Shakes too much when shuffle the cards."
5,Great Tea! Great taste!,"I have been looking for a tea that could take the place of the tea I was drinking which was a wonderful Chai but I drank it with Cinnamon Vanilla creamer and milk. Latte style! I do not need the extra calories. I tried a few ginger teas and disliked them immensely but this tea was great. I get the same warming bite that I got with the Chai but I don't have to have the milk and the creamer. I am forming a new ""like affair"" with this tea. Great tea! Beneficial! and so very soothing."
4,Service,We ordered two shufflers. One was fine but one was faulty and had to be returned. They quickly replaced the item and returned postage to our account.
4,Casino 6-Deck Automatic Card Shuffler,"This shuffler works pretty well. Sometimes a few cards will get stuck in the side, but it's an easy fix to remove them. It was very inexpensive, and we are happy with it."
2,Did not work!,"When I received the card shuffler, the left side did not work. Rather than sending it back. I took it apart and the wires were loose. After a quick repair it works great."
3,PAIN FREE CARD SHUFFLER,"THE CARD GAME, MY LADIES GROUP PLAYS, TAKES FIVE TO SIX DECKS OF CARDS AND THE CARDS HAVE TO BE SHUFFLED MANY TIMES DURING PLAY. BEING SENIORS WE ALL SUFFER FROM PAINFUL JOINTS, SO THIS CARD SHUFFLER WAS A REAL JOY TO USE. THERE WERE A FEW PROBLEMS HOWEVER. THE FIRST PROBLEM WE FOUND WAS THAT IT DID NOT COME WITH INSTRUCTIONS. SO WHEN WE FIRST USED IT ALL THE CARDS CAME FLYING OUT OF THE OPEN AREA IN THE FRONT. WE KNEW THIS SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING, SO WE TRIED DIFFERENT WAYS TO PUT THE SHIELD ON UNTIL FINALLY WE GOT IT RIGHT. THE SECOND PROBLEM WE FOUND WAS THAT THE CARDS WOULD GET STUCK AND BUNCH UP CAUSING A PROBLEM, BUT WE WERE SO HAPPY WE DID NOT HAVE TO SHUFFLE THEM, WE PUT UP WITH IT. (IT DID NOT HAPPEN ALL THE TIME, JUST ONCE IN A WHILE). BASICLY WE ARE HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT AND THE PRICE WAS RIGHT."
3,Card Shuffler,"This is the 3rd card shuffler I've ordered through Amazon. The first two either had something broken when they arrived OR simply would not shuffle cards (and, yes, I do put use batteries in). The one I have now shuffles the cards and that's exciting! However, it arrived with a broken (missing) small part. The part should hold the guard piece that holds the cards in the shute while shuffling so I hold it with my hand. I am disgusted with sending stuff back to Amazon and receiving no apology, no matter how easy or hard it may be. Sorry, but I'm disappointed."
1,Casino Poker Shuffler,"I was very disappointed in the shuffler. It didn't work right in the beginning. I thought we could use it with the minor problem, but it is just getting worse and does not shuffle the cards correctly. I have had other shufflers of the same make and they worked just fine although they don't tend to last a long time if used a lot."
4,Casino Automatic Card Shuffler,I like the shuffler very much but there are times when the cards come out on both sides at the same time and it blocks the cards from shuffling. No other complaints.
2,Shuffle your cards or your feet,"I have purchased several of the 6-deck shufflers. I work in a senior community and we play cards quite often. There is one game that requires 5 decks of cards to play so the shuffler is perfect, while it functions properly. When we ordered our last two shufflers, we were shocked that they wouldn't even move the cards through the shuffling mechanism. We have had that happen before but it was two months old when it started. These were right out of the box. They were returned and now I don't know where I can get a better quality of shuffler."
2,Got shuffled,Casino 6 Deck Automatic Card Shuffler worked fine for about six shuffels and than the one side did not work. Not too happy with it.
5,Great Card Shufflers!!,I really got a good deal - 6-deck shuffler and six decks of cards were included! I am wearing it all out -- playing lots of card games. Thanks for dependable speedy service. Product lives up to what was promised. Thanks.
1,Did not work upon arrival.,"Did not work upon arrival. I shipped it back for a refund. And guess what, the next one did not work either."
1,don't get it,"This is my thirdpurchase of this card shuffler and for some reason this one does not work properly. Of course, I did not discover this until I had discarded return materials."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"When it comes to automatic card shufflers -- or anything, for that matter -- you often get what you pay for. This modestly priced item is a perfect example. Its performance at shuffling cards leaves a bit to be desired: it's noisy, and the feeder sometimes gets a bit overzealous and takes in too many cards at a time, frequently resulting in a haphazard stack of cards facing the wrong way or standing up on end. For the price, the performance is poor. If knocked down somewhere in the vicinity of $5, it might be a satisfactory buy. Consider this before ruling out automatic card shufflers that are slightly higher on the price scale."
3,Sketchy,"I have ordered 6 of these I believe. 4 out of 6 have been fine. 2 are crummy. Stiff, won't shuffle cards properly. But I need these due to arthritis so must continue to order."
3,6 deck card shuffler,"of the 3 card shufflers i bought,only 2 of them worked.the 2 works ok but theyget the cards stuck at times."
3,Casino 6-Deck Auto-Card Shuffler,"This is a great idea and works well for about 6-12 months then the feeding wheels wear out or break and you have to buy another. Well, at least that is our experience thus far. Others we know say theirs is still running just fine but me thinks they do not use the device as often as we. Therefore our usage is at least double the norm.Wish they would improve or reinforce those little wheels! Life would be a lot better! :oP"
4,winderful,The only problem is that the shuffler will pass two or three cards at one time this does not mix well and needs to be run 3 or 4 times.
2,Casino 6-Deck Automatic Card Shuffler,"I bought the shuffler hoping it would help shuffle 4-5 decks at a time. It mostly shuffled perfectly, but about 6 out of 10 times, the cards would jam in the receiving tray. The spring that makes it go down as the cards come out didn't seem very stable. Also, unless I placed my hand in front of the clear plastic guard, the cards wouldn't eject smoothly. If I had it to do over again, I would not have purchased. Even though it worked most of the time, it was cumbersome to use."
2,6-deck shuffler,"This is the second one we have bought, the first one just quit. This one with five decks gets tangled up several times on each shuffle. Do you have a remedy? Thanks,Richard,"
1,Stay AWAY,"Unit arrived quickly, packaging was ok.Did not work correctly from the first use.Left side of the shuffler would hardly work and kept stopping.After using it 5 times the bar you press to get the cards to shuffle was hit or miss and the entire unit would not work.Sent back for a refund."
4,Great price and reliable performance,The shuffler works like a champ with 4-6 decks. The batteries also seem to hold up very well as we play a few times a week and its been almost two months since I bought it. Only one small complaint is that it is really loud while shuffling. Excellent product and performance for the price.
3,Inexpensive and adequate,"Makes life playing killer bunnies (LOTS of cards) Much easier and we're seeing new cards again! It's not built well, but if it breaks I'll just get another one.. worth the small investment."
2,Card shuffler,"I have now purchased about 5 of these shufflers, each one of them has a flaw. They would be a great tool if they worked properly. In my years of purchasing them, I have been able to keep 2 but when they go bad, I have a hard, very hard time finding one that works. I will not give up but I am sure the buyers are tired of me constantly returning the product and I hope they are not turning around and just resending them back out. Fix the problem or make them in the USA for a change."
4,6-Deck Auto Card Shuffler,"So far this card shuffler has worked quite well. It rarely jams with cards and performs quite smoothly. It is a little noisier than desired, especially when operated on a wood table top. It would benefit from having rubber bumper feet on the bottom to help dampen the noise. Besides the noise, I am quite satisfied with this product and have been enjoying it during my card games. Great for hand and foot!"
5,Fun and useful,"Useful for people with dry hands (like me) who finds it hard to shuffle frequently (kids games, etc.).Cards get stuck sometimes - but okay.Came up with a 'glass barrier' - hardly used it as it is not very convenient to keep removing it after shuffling.I am also looking for 'auto card distributor' (good for dry hands). Hope I will find it soon!"
4,Does the job,"This works pretty well. It will sometimes get hung up and not spit things trough but it is usually when it gets to the bottom of the pile. We play a game called Killer bunnies, which is very fun, and it has tons of cards, so this has been very helpful to us."
2,Don't waste your money,Worked fairly well first two times of use but noticed that the right side of the shuffler didn't work as well. Have used it about 5 different occasions now and it's not worth using. The right side hardly shoots any cards in. Left side works great but not worth using if they don't both shoot cards in. Don't waste your money - use your hands instead!
3,6-Deck Card Shuffler,"A little disappointed in this product. Works great when you first use it, but then the cards begin jamming, then you have to put in less and less cards at a time. Kind of defeats the purpose. When the batteries get weak, this gets worse quickly. Would not buy this product again. G. Frantz, Dayton, OH"
1,Barely functional junk,When is works this product is pretty decent. However the cheap plastic parts tend to lock and need to be pushed to start working again. The rest of the product is loose and low quality as well. I do not have high hopes that this product will last very long at all.
1,Doesn't shuffle.,"I don't understand how this thing could have gotten the positive reviews it did. It quite simply does not shuffle cards; what it does do is take cards from two different piles, and intersperse them together. This is very, very far from random - for example, cards that start on top of the two piles are guaranteed to be on top of the resulting ""shuffled"" pile, and vice versa for those on the bottom. This quite simply is not a card shuffler, despite the name. Do not buy this if you actually want your cards shuffled, because it does not do that - all it does is very slightly rearrange the cards."
3,shuffler shuffle,"I purchased three (3) of these shufflers, one for my own use and two to give to others. The first one sounds like the motor is binding and even with fresh batteries, it will barely run. We used it five times and ""retired"" it. The second one, one of the little tabs that hold the card tray in the center, broke off. It shuffles fine but the missing tab makes it inconvenient."
2,Bad workmanship on card shuffler,"This was my second order for the Casino 6-deck automatic shuffler. The first one worked great until, I'm guessing, some contact stopped making proper contact. So, I ordered another one since I had liked the first one. We used the second one five times - first 2 times it worked fine but it sounded like it was straining. The next two times it worked sluggishly as if the batteries were weak. I again purchased new batteries, thinking maybe I had gotten some bad batteries when I first installed them in the new machine. Guess what? New batteries did not help. It still sounded as if ""it were on it's last leg"", very slow, not moving the cards through the shuffler. I tried every thing I could think but to no avail. Evidently, I had purchased a lemon!"
3,Card Shuffler,"We love the shuffler. I had bought 2, one I sent back because of a defect. I plan to order another. When you are playing with multiple decks of cards, you need this shuffler to mix them well."
2,Disappointed,"We love the shuffler but after the first use, a spring came loose and it took us a couple of hours to figure out how to fix it. It could be made a little sturdier."
4,Needed this product,"Bought this item for a card playing group. All worked fine. Came on time, packed well. Would recommend this item for any card player.Casino 6-deck auto matic shuffler"
2,Broken,It was broken and missing parts when we first got it.I had to take apart to fix it. the wires in it were not connected also.
2,Disappointed,This product disappointed me because it has a hard time shuffling sometimes and also shoots cards off the top. Try a different one if you can.
5,Card shuffler speeds up game playing.,I can not shuffle cards. This machine works great. Cards do not get bent as they do when manually shuffled.
1,waste of money!,"This machine is a ""lemon "". It has not worked properly from the onset. I'm totally disappointed in this item. I have purchased a few of them before with no problems, not this one."
3,Automatic Card Shuffler,"The card shuffler is cheaply made but if cared for will work well. Although I have only had it for a short period of time, it shuffles the cards well and works better with 2 or more decks. It will be interesting to see how long it will last after conitnued use. Price is good for the product and it is serving its purpose. I would buy it again."
1,doesn't work,One of the shufflers works but the other does not-it bunches up the cards and then it won't shuffle.The second seems to work fine and they really are great for games requiring 6 decks of cards
1,I dont receive my package,"I wanted to solicit your support, this because this package in the traking number appears delivered, but I have not receivedWaiting for your comments. Thank you very much"
4,graet product,this makes card playing very easy--when you're a little older you're hands don't work as well!! Made shuffling a good thing.
4,The Timesaving 6-Deck Automatic Card Shuffler by Casino,"The timesaving convenience of this card shuffler adds to the enjoyment of the game by reducing the amount of downtime required for shuffling. Its ease of operation is most noticeable on 4-6 decks, but frequent use of this shuffler has us using it even for single or double-deck games.Prior to us purchasing this automatic card shuffler, because of her arthritic hands, it was necessary to shuffle the cards for my grandmother. Now, even Grandma wants to use it! She says it ""Equalizes the Playing Field!"""
3,Not a good as I hoped,"Probably should have stayed with the 4 deck size; this one doesn't work as smooth, cards get stuck on the sides and the plastic card catcher is not easy and smooth to handle you have to make sure it is behind plastic clips or you have cards everywhere."
3,6 deck card shuffler,"I have an old one that I bought years ago and it is great. I bought 2 for one person and they would not work - just on one side. She threw them away and I ordered her two more. They work, but they are hard to push. I ordered 3 for my card group and they all stick. I still have one that we haven't used. One for another person that hasn't tried it yet. I hope those two work okay."
1,Ruined my cards in two uses,Bought this for Munchkin the card game. I put my cards through it twice and it wore all the edges off my brand new expansion deck. I left it at the friends I was playing with not worth my time returning. I do not recommend this as a munchkin card shuffled as other reviewers suggest
4,Shuffler,"This is a good shuffler. It holds 6 or less decks of cards. One thing to remember, use new cards. It is made well but the card slots are tight and old cards or bent cards will stick a lot. Use new decks and don't bend them or shuffle by hand. With new cards it works perfect and the cards will last for hundreds of shuffles. It takes 2 C batteries for each side and if batteries get low, one side may shuffle faster than the other. Also if the batteries get low, it won't shuffle a full 3 deck stack on each side, so start with part of the cards and just add as it shuffles. It shuffles very fast."
4,Not bad for 12 bucks!,"Well, if you expect perfection, you'll need to pay more than $12! It sure beats shuffling by hand, though! It feels super cheap, and it jams up about 1 in 3 times. You can easily pull the jammed up cards out and keep moving. Nice that it uses batteries so it's portable. I'd recommend it, works pretty well!"
1,Card Shuffler,"This card shuffler does not work at all. Yes, we put batteries in it (new ones) and it does absolutely nothing. I will be sending it back for a refund."
4,Card shuffler,"This card shuffler is made fairly well. It does flip cards sometimes but for the most part it does OK. Make sure to put the clear retainer behind the 2 lugs, it makes it work better."
2,Too Easily Broken,"This is the 2nd one I've purchased and neither one has lasted past the 1st set of batteries. One of the springs on the tray on the 1st machine I purchased let go and caused the cards to flip upside down and ""box"". After a couple of months use, both sides would continue to spin when the actuator was depressed, but would not feed the cards. On the 2nd machine I purchased one of the locator tabs for the tray broke-off almost immediately and now one side of the card shuffler feeds real slow, while the other side feeds normally. ""They say you get what you pay for"", and this holds true for this product. I wouldn't mind spending more money for something of better quality."
4,Card shuffler performance,"We ordered this 6 card shuffler, and upon receiving, the gear wheels turned, but no cards would be picked up. After trying and trying with no change, I made the decision to return the unit for a new one. I received a new one very quickly, even before returning the old one.The new one works fine, as it is supposed to."
3,6-Deck Shuffler,"This was our 2nd purchase of this type of card shuffler. Understand that it is made of plastic, but many items break easily. Works well under the circumstances."
3,Mediocre,"I bought it to shuffle my Munchkin card deck - which as 200+ cards. It makes it through halfway, then bogs down. It is very loud and feels clunky. Cheap plastic. I got what I paid for."
5,Shuffles and is cheap,"This shuffles the four decks of cards. You might have a jam with the last 10 or 12 cards, but it is easy to just take them out of the shuffler. For the price, this is great!"
4,Much better than shuffling multiple decks by hand,Yes it is plastic but when I compare the difficulty of shuffling multiple decks by hand vs being patient in loading I choose patience. It works and I'm thankful.
2,bad instructions.,I wouldn't recommend this product to anybody . Instructions were horrible. Endded up wingging it and it was a tight fit in my Honda prelude .
3,Be sure you're buying the right edition!,"Please note that there is both a tenth edition and an UPDATED tenth edition. They're virtually identical, but the updated edition has materials related to the Crawford case addressing the confrontation clause."
3,Difficult to understand,"Almost no notes or comments on compiled materials in the book. It is difficult to find keys to understand materials from this book without assistance from teachers or study guides. The materials themselves are instructive and interesting. The book becomes voluminous due to the appended rules and their notes. If one has a separate rule book, he/she has to spend more for the unnecessary appendix attached to this book."
2,"Gradiva, a tiresome short movie","Sure, Dani Verissimo is too cute but this movie's garbled ""plot"" is not worth explaining. Overacting is mainly the American character's duty, to make American viewers more ashamed. If you're into bondage don't expect much and you'll be so pleased with _Gradiva_."
3,Cave Women,This movie lacks quality of plot. It does provide many scenes of women running around in various animal skins. There is no nudity but it is constantly suggested.
1,The story is older than time,"In the standard prehistoric tribal environment the women are rightfully subjugated. One rebellious woman has a problem with authority figures and opts to correct that with a rock to the male cranium.Realizing that this might provoke the other males, she heads for the woods or jungle with a handful of women and girls. Of courses being a moral film in the time so censorship the females must be punished so they get dragged off by a giant; thus they leave a hand full of girls to be brought up without males by a wise old woman.We come to the opening scene where the women not knowing what they are missing have to dance to exhaustion (we get exhausted watching).Soon after being told that men can be useful for propagating, they set out to subdue some pretty feeble men for this nefarious purpose.In the process we see the invention of fire and its consequences.I recommend that this film should not fall in the hands of women."
2,pre-feminist romp between savage boys and girls,"WOw, this is a funny and outdated movie that purports to be archaeologically accurate. My daughter and I watched with a constant stream of laughter, she being a serious student of archaeology.A band of tough women - all clean cut and covered above and below - have decided they need to claim mates. They were separated off from another tribe when very young, due to the bad treatment their mothers received as women slaves. Now these women will knock out some boys and take them on their terms. Once the boys are taken captive, they discover fire and claim dominance in their turn. Then, in a mutual fight against an evil giant, they truly bond and found their own tribe.Not only is the story preposterous, but the acting is not all that great and the science is rather questionable. That being said, we did enjoy it, granted more as an object of ridicule than a film experience.Not recommended unless you can get a free copy."
2,So bad it's good?? You be the judge....,"The only thing going for this movie is the girls and their outfits and that's it,but what do you expect from a cheap movie??Bad effects,bad acting and so on...THE perfect movie for MST3K....Rent first,then buy,but hey,it's only 7 bucks or so,right???"
3,My Dream Come True!...,"OK, some cave-babes are treated as nothing more than slave labor for the men in their tribe. This leads them to rise up and flee. The women are happy and free in the wilderness. Then, the day comes when the wise old woman of the bunch tells them they need to track down some males or face extinction. Enter the dashing young he-men of the story! The gals take them by force, enslaving and emasculating the poor saps. Then, the men get the upper hand by slaying the ""dragon"" (sort of a big pelican) and the roles are reversed. Now, the men subjugate the women once more. Along comes the giant Gwaddi (a big hairy guy w/ more beard than face), and the group must battle together for survival. Gwaddi is slain and peace and harmony reign. PREHISTORIC WOMEN isn't quite as good as WILD WOMEN OF WONGO, but it is enoyable. We get to see how both fire and the use of levers started! Watch and learn..."
1,"Nice, but a little overboard...","First, let me say that it's a nice book. But the level of preciousness of this tome is enough to make anyone's stomach turn. Save your money, and buy a book that does a little more research, and leaves out the cute touches. But if you want to find out how to brew a cup of tea, this one will get you in the right direction. A little more editing would have helped."
2,Disapointied by Reality,"The author tried to enlighten people about serving Victorian Tea, and I believe she did her best. But, I was only dissapointed by the sad reality, if this book reflects general cognition about teas and antiques among general public in USA. Isn't it out of question to serve tea in styloform cups? I feel sorry that she had to advise not to!"
3,Good introduction to the art of Victorian tea.,"A good, practical introduction to the arts of having a Victorian tea. I had the opportunity to meet Ms. Pinchney at a tea conference a couple years ago and she is as gracious as her book would imply! Recommended."
3,Cowell 5,"I've owned this CD since the mid 90s so I'm reviewing it rather late. I bought it for the Cowell Symphony and I have to say that the other pieces on the disc do not seem very memorable. Not so the Cowell. This is finely made music: intense, plangent, dignified and very moving in parts. The first reviewer admires Cowell the rebel, the innovator, and that's fair enough, but HC's orchestral music is well worth an airing and I think he is mistaken to dismiss it. I'd love to hear this symphony in a clean, bright modern recording. I think it would be sensational. As it is, though, this recording is rather poor, even by the standards of the time it was made, so only those very curious about Cowell and his music should invest in it. I'd give the disc five stars for the symphony but only one for the recording - so I've compromised at three!"
3,dafd,"An actually pretty good movie, lots of twists and pervertive ness ^^ although not much lesbian stuff... but other wise this is probbly worth borrowing out from the video store or buying cheap ^^"
2,Must like Raw Native American Also,"This CD is not one of my favorites because it has a large mix of tracks that are already on other CDs. It also has some very raw and authentic sounds, not your typcial modern Native American. Although there is some of that, too. The nice effect is how each song runs into each other as if the whole CD is one continuous track. There are songs on this CD that consist totally of nature sounds. More for therapy or relaxation if that is what you are looking for. And then, there is Brulé which is awesome but you're better off just buying a Brulé album and enjoyig all of their singles."
2,Bowling game,The game was not nearly as sturdy as I had hoped. A piece broke off as I was putting it together. Too sensitive to touch. Wouldn't purchase again for an 8 year old.
1,Real Disappointment!!!,"You gotta be kidding me with this Rack 'N' Bowl. My sons were anxiously awaiting it when it was delivered today. It is missing all 6 feet which the instructions tell you to attach to the front & back of the base. Both pieces of the base barely stay together -- when you roll the bowling ball, it hits the separated area of the base. The instructions also refer to an on and off switch, but this too is missing. I could have done better going to a Dollar Store!!"
4,A worthy buy for my boys!!,"My boys just love it!! They learnt how to share, taking turns in rolling n even cheered for each other!!Though arguments are unavoidable most of the time... I find the toy a family bonding game...."
1,It's Junk,Just took ours to Goodwill - kids played with it once or twice - not nearly as fun as advertised.
1,Don't BUY into this,"Only in this day & age where the ""ME"" BOOMER generation is having childrenat a menopausal age and teaching them the value of ""the one who dies with the most toys wins"" Now children are brought up with having everything they want and are raised learning the importance of having it all. Who needs love when you can have an Ipod Mini?"
1,Fabulous research!,"This book provides valuable insight into maximizing profit from your 4-12 year-old target market - it has been very helpful in developing promotional material for my large corporate firm. With this valuable research I helped my firm pull in larger profits, leaving minds of society's youth in my wake - including the minds of my own children. But that's okay: I make it up to them by buying them whatever they want. Of course, I'm sure they will want the usual - a trip to the new Disney movie and dinner afterwards at McDonald's. It's baffling yet convenient how they always want the same thing! I recommend this book to any father with sound, capitalistic priorities."
2,Should Come With Planer,"These tables are almost a must with this planer. In my opinion they should come with the planer, so you might as well add on another [...] bucks for these. What a dissapointment. Just another way for whoever to make more greenbacks."
2,Careful here,These are sold in combo with the Planer stand. Be careful they mount on the Planer not on the stand.
1,Seek life elsewhere.,"These tables are scrap metal. Let me be clear that I think the planer itself is giant paperweight, but these were just the icing on the cake. It (the planer) lasted about a month in my home workshop. Thankfully I found someone looking for a planer for super light boards and I got rid of it. If you plane more than balsa wood or more than 3 boards in a month, find a heavier unit. You won't regret it."
4,DEWALT DW7351 Folding Table for DW735. Must Have.,The DW735 planer should have been built with the folding tables as standard equipment but was not. Therefore the DW7351 Folding Table for the DW735 is a must have to make planing operations easier and to produce better results.
4,Needed but could be improved,"I purchased the extension table for the Dewalt DW735 planer hoping that it would completely eliminate snipe, however even with the tables I still get snipe at both speeds on the planer. I think that I'll have to re-adjust the tables to get better results. The table on the outfeed side of the planer does not fold up unless the planer is cranked really high due to the chip exit port. Overall the tables are helpful, but should come standard with the ""portable"" planer."
5,A necessity.,I have spent over 2 hours filling out how I rate products that I bought through the last year or so and then you have to have 20 more words in order for me to submit my ratting. This is it.
4,DEWALT planer extension tables,"These extension tables are a great addition to a great planer, but they don't eliminate snipe completely."
5,Planer Shelves are Great,"The shelves are very useful and they were very easy to install. I like them very much.Thanks,John"
4,"design flaw on rear table attachment, otherwise great","Okay, I finally got the folding tables. They are very easy to assemble and align. Each corner of each table can be adjusted for height. The attachment points are spring loaded so they are also easy to take off and put back on. They do help in supporting the work and seem very solid. The front table folds up out of the way and stays there. The rear table however is another story. Because the main table and the back of the moter/blade assembly are pretty much even and the pin to hold the table is set back the rear table will never fold up and stay. When the depth of cut is set around an inch and the cord is wrapped around the cord holder the rear table won't flip up more then around 20 degrees. In my opinion this is a major design flaw, the main table needs to stick out at the rear by at least an inch or two to allow the table to fold up."
3,DW7351 tables improve planer and minimizes snipe,"The tables are easy to install. Folds up against the planer when the planer is not used for a smaller storage footprint for the planer. The tables are easily to remove and reinstall if necessary. The table returns to the same level after removal and reinstaliation. One adjusted to match the planer's plate, no readjsutment is needed. The table is heavy, well made and not likely to flex as wood is passing over the table. Worth the money but it would have nice for DeWalt to include them as part of the planer package."
4,Folding Table for 735 Planer,"These extension tables greatly increase the accuracy of the 735 planer by reducing snipe through additional support on longer stock. They are relatively easy to mount, and provide a plane even with the bed of the 735 planer. While the front (input) table can fold up when not in use, the rear (outfeed) table is blocked by the exhaust port and cannot be raised.All in all, I would not be without these additions to my planer."
4,Folding Table For Dewalt DW7351,"I was happy with the ease of installation, the fact that all hardware came with the kit. The instructions were easy to follow and adjustments were easy to make once the installating was complete. It only took about 20-30 minutes to install and adjust the tables."
5,simple the best,"This is the best planner I have ever used. I got the planner about 2 weeks ago. I used it without the extension table and has a little bit of snipe, barely noticeable. The tables went on without much work and are dead flat, they are a must have to make a great planer better."
5,Thickness Planer Folding Tables,Very good tables but be aware of the adjustment mounting screws that will be necessary to relate to your machine.
3,A good idea,It's a good idea. But they don't line up flush with the planner table.. you will still have the planner snipe weather you use the folding tables or not..
5,product review,"very nice addition to the DeWalt Planer, Completely removed any snipe.DeWalt product excellent, Amazon Service Great as always.s d parish"
1,Joke,This should come with the planer at no extra cost... its like buying a car and having to buy the spare tire!
5,Extensioins Tables for DW735,I really feel this item should be sold with the planner. I first tried using the planner without them and just about the time you get the feel on when the boards are going into the machine flat the roller grab the board. This causes the bit of vibration down the board causing the first few inches of planning to be a bit rough. With these extensions I get totally clean boards around every time.
3,Doesn't fold up out of the way.,"The folding table works excellent and the feed table tilts up to a vertical position for storage but the discharge side, even with the vacuum assembly removed, will not tilt up to a vertical position during storage and there is no way to position it out of the way."
3,"Good, but...","I bought this to help eliminate snipe in my DW735. Unfortunately, the snipe monster still rears its ugly head in my DW735. I've done a lot of research and just about all of it says that the snipe typically goes away when adding these tables. Back to the drawing board!With that said, I think these are still valuable to provide support for pieces going in and out of the planer."
4,A must-have for most,"As has been said elsewhere, they're a must-have unless you're building a dedicated workstation. But if you were going to go through that kind of trouble, a floor standing planer would make more sense. I think they're an appropriate size for the machine. For the size of the machine and these tables, it is pretty easy to keep snipe to a minimum. The only complaint I have is the inability to fold up the rear with dust collection in place.While others might not consider it ""portable"" I do, and would appreciate tables that fold up and lock into place. I usually fold up the outfeed as best I can and put it against the wall of my trailer. It's enough of an inconvenience to give it 4 out of 5 stars.[rant]I still believe these should have been packaged with the planer, but they weren't. [/rant] That being said, if you have a DS735 planer, these are a must-have item. Figure that in the price when you're comparing other planers."
5,Very useful,Extra smooth for sliding wood. This is a necessary attachment. Easy to install. The main table needs to stick out at the rear by at least an inch or two to allow the table to fold up.
4,dewalt dw735,great machine for the price i love this thing!!! i used it on some rock hard purple heart and maple and came out smooth as silk with minimal snipe. i would recomend this machine over the higher priced machines if your a hobbiest.Gave it only four stars because it dosent have a finishing speed option
5,Great investment,"This is a great way to invest in woodworking, you get to plane your own boards for an added level of personalization. It would be nice if this unit had two speeds but for the price, it is fantastic. Very little snipe and easy adjustments make planing more enjoyable than some other units. The dust hood needs to be screwed into the cutterhead which is a little obnoxious but once it is attached you don't need to think about it again...until you go to fold the outfeed table back up. Planed over 1000 linear feet of lumber with no problems other than some sawdust sticking to the rollers making them slip. Overall, I'm very happy with the DW764."
3,Blades are a killer....,"The machine is great, nicer than my old delta by a long shot but the blades are crap. They last half as long at best, you are not supposed to sharpen them (you can of course but wheres the money for dewalt in that?), and while they are still pretty sharp they bog down the self feed so you have to change them anyway. I cant say I wouldnt have bought it knowing what I know now but its a downer. And I LOVE my other Dewalts."
4,Dewalt review,"This planer, planes very well. I hooked up the part that helps extract the savings. It clogs up alot, even with a shop vac attached to it sucking out the shavings at the same time. I then just left the vac off and it still clogs up alot. Other than that, it works great."
4,Nice Planer,"Does a very nice job. Easy to set up, easy to use. Would give 5 stars except for one annoying little thing....... You cannot fold up the outfeed tray with the dust collection hood attached. This makes it a little challenging to store when you are short on space."
2,"Great at first, then it stops feeding","worked for the first 5 boards (6' long doug fir, approx. 50-100 years old) and then it stopped feeding reliably. looked on here and found that others had the same issue. unsure of the cause, but the bottom line is that it wasn't feeding properly. tried calling dewalt, they were closed on the saturday. tried feeding to different parts of the table. tried feeding with less or more depth being taken off with each pass. tried to make sure it was being fed level and getting support along the way. nothing seemed to work.can't recommend this planer. while it worked great at first and seems to have a good build, it didn't feed correctly and there was a crack that i noticed later in the plastic motor housing, right above the ""e"" in the dewalt logo on the front."
2,"Great intitially, Not designed for longevity.","I purchased this planer a couple years ago to plane rough cut pine. It worked well out of the box and continued to do so for the first year. After about 1,000bf of mainly pine the drive rollers started having trouble pulling material throught the cutterhead. I should have taken notice at this point and determined the problem, I may have been able to prevent the problems I now have. The bushings that support the rollers are very cheap and not designed for much use as there is no way to keep them adequately lubricated. As a result the bushings siezed on the shafts destroying the shafts and causing the chain drive and sprockets to break. This is going to be a fairly expensive repair so I am simply going to do minimal repairs to get by until I can purchase a better designed planer."
5,great portable planer,"I just completed a custom trim job in which I planed just over 6000 feet of rough sawn cedar. The planer performed exceptionally well, and I only had to purchase one additional set of knives. (The double sided knives are a great money/time saving feature. I would HIGHLY recommend this tool."
1,Blades get dull WAY too soon.,"With sharp blades, this planer deserves a 5 star rating. The problem is, the knifes get dull far too quickly. Once the knifes are dull, even 1/32"" cuts quickly overload the motor, and the thermal cut off activates. My blades became dull after cutting about 30 BF of soft wood (cedar). Flipped the blades over, and 30BF later, dull blades, and overheating. At $50 per set, blades are EXPENSIVE."
5,Does the job,Have used this to plane Red oak. I am getting a very smooth finish. Depth of cut control is good but would like to add a digital readout to improve control.
5,Very good machine,"As advertised, easy to use, compact, and clean when used with a shop-vac. A nice addition to a home wood working shop."
5,FLAWLESS!,"Whew! I don't know what I'd do without this baby! I love it! I make it work hard, and it just keeps going. The cut measurements are perfect for me."
5,I can't wait to use this on a real project!,"I am new to woodworking so I don't know how much weight my review will carry. In any case, I purchased this item from Lowes this past weekend for $359. I haven't had much time to ""play with my new toy"", however, I was able to send a piece of Pine through the machine shortly after purchasing it. I haven't used a Planer since Jr High (late 70's) but setting up and using the DW734 was a breeze. This planer is amazing!"
1,dull blades ruin a good tool,"After less than 50ft of planing relatively clean oak, the knives became dull. I reversed them and got another 50ft before the knives became dull again. At $45 bucks a pop, these blades are too expensive to get less than a couple of hours of work out of them. I had a small Delta planer for several years, used it regularly, and only replaced the blades a few times.I like the machine, but DeWalt must fix the blade problem. Otherwise, it is a piece of crap. I'm returning it."
4,What you need to know,"I've had this planer for some time now. This is a brief review of what you'll expect from the DW734:It can handle anything with a Janka hardness rating of 1400 or under fairly well, so forget using it on Hickory.It will leave a small 2"" snipe (normal for planers).Fresh, sharp blades leave a perfect finish.It will have a hard time cutting just about anything wider than 8"" but if it's a softer wood you should be fine.If you use it for prolonged periods of time it will overheat, it is not meant for that.Knives will need to be rotated after 200 bd ft of Alder to as little as 30 bd ft of Hickory (that's bad).This is not an industrial tool, if you are thinking of using it in your cabinet shop pay twice as much and get one from [...].If you build a little bit of furniture or are just starting out this may be just the tool you need.Thanks :)"
3,Not the quality of the older ones.,"I had one of the old DW733 for almost 15-years of hard use before it finally wore out, So when I bought one of the new one with the 3 cutter head expecting the same kind of quality, However in about a 1-1/2 years of ownership I have seized the drive roller bushings and broke the drive sprockets 3 times now. I have managed to keep it going by salvaging parts of old unit.The cut quality is excellent however."
4,Dewalt Planer,"The Dewalt DW734 is a great little planer. It came fully assembled and ready to use. It's easy to use and produces a beautiful surface on the wood. I haven't yet had to replace the blades, so can't comment on how long they last.The only problem I have encountered is when using the piece of wood to be planed to set the depth, it's hard to get it out again! I have solved that by simply cranking up the head a bit, taking the piece out and cranking it down the same amount. I agree with others that taking off more than about 1/32 at a time wouldn't work well.I'm very glad that I bought this machine."
5,Dewalt,Only have had and used the planer a short time. Planed alot of maple and walnut brds for a cutting brd project. Have had no problems and love the planer so far. I will give a further review when I change cutters and use more.
1,Jesse Lovers,"If you are a Jesse Cook fan, this is a fun cd - it makes you want to see the video. For strictly music, i'd choose another of his cd's without the ""live"" sound effects"
4,Good Music,"As always, Jesse Cook is great. The live aspect of the performance is nice, but the vocals are not quite as good as the ones from the studio versions of these cuts."
1,"Falls apart, horrible production value","This book is half good. Half of the Wood Boy story is really well illustrated, then the second half is drawn by some amateur. Same thing with the second story, the first half looks like the artist took his time to craft a lovely visual, then the second half it looks super-rushed, and half-assed.Then the production value, filler pages flood the middle of the book advertising another series. ADVERTISTING. In a GRAPHIC NOVEL. Then at the end of the book you get a bunch of low resolution sketches that look like they were taken off a website at 72dpi.Whoever ran the production and editing on this book should be kicked out of the comic book world until they have a clue how to put a decent book together."
3,Room for everything!,This purse has room for everything!!Large leather purse w/manmade flap and bottom.Big but not bulky.
2,Handles broke after only two weeks of use,"I already had to take the purse to a shoe maker to replace the tabs the hold the handles on, they were made of cardboard covered with plastic. Although I really like the look of the bag and the large size, I am very disapointed with the quality!"
3,THE REAL DEAL REVIEW!,"I'M A HIGHLY ACTIVE OUTDOORSMAN. My trade is building contractor specifically carpentry but do many other aspects as well. I also sell firewood and heat my home w/firewood as a supplement to Gas. I cut, haul split, load, up to 10 cord a year by myself. I also ride a Honda crf450x in the woods and on trails. I say all this so you know what my gloves go through. These Ranchworx are very cool looking, but under heavy use they split at the seams on the fingers. They don't fit too great either. I wear xl but have to constantly pul them on and push down between fingers. There are better gloves out there for the money, like Carharrt or CLC."
5,love these globes!,I used these for just about everything. Very comfortable and durable for just about anything you can think of doing around the house or work.
3,fairly good,"I bought a pair of these for working here on the ranch. The first day I split the first layer of leather, but I was rotating the chain on my chainsaw to get a jam out.Probily not designed for that. They have some threads that have unravelled and a few more cuts but I have really ran them through the mill. sretching barbed wire and driving T post. Cutting bois d arc post and such is hard on any glove.After a year they are still alive but not real pretty. Most of the time I dont wear gloves because skin grows back and gloves dont but I am starting to get tired of bleeding.I would say they are worth buying if you catch a deal on the."
5,This is an excellent graded reader for students of German.,"Part of the German-language Easy Reader series, this graded reader is a fast-moving ""detective"" story. Emil is a boy who is going to visit his grandmother in the big city. His money is stolen on the train, and the rest of the story is about all the people he meets as the thief is pursued. (This series is divided up into four levels, A through D. Each category supposes that the reader has a certain amount of acquired vocabulary before beginning, then builds on that to increase the reader's ability in the language. I myself have 14 titles in German, but there are more. Easy Reader/EMC Paradigm markets readers in several other languages, including French, Spanish and Italian.)"
3,Elementary German boyhood adventure,This is a classic 2d year German text. It tells of the adventures of a boy (Emil) on a trip with enough mysterious goings on to retain the Junior High or High School Sophomore's interest to the the end. Great for polishing up rusty German for the adult.
5,magic in a tube,"I'm 36 with combination skin, prone to some acne... this is the only cream i have been able to use without my skin breaking out and the results are tremendous. Since I started using Kinerase cream, people compliment my skin (even few hours after delivering my baby.)... the truth I'm amazed myself. Kinerase worths every penny, believe the hype."
3,Way overpriced for what it delivers!!!,"You only need about a pea sized amount for the entire face. I found it creamy and moisturizing without being greasy. Sinks in quickly. The finished look was quite matte. After about an hour, my face didn't feel quite as moisturized anymore. My complaint is that for this price, you should be moisturized all day long (like my unrefined shea butter does and for 1/10th of the cost). I definitely feel that this product is priced way too high for what it delivers."
5,Kinerase cream,Kinerase is wonderful for aging skin. It minimizes fine lines and keeps skin healthy looking.
5,EXCELENT.........,"FAST SHIPPING AND PERFECT PRODUCT, IM ORDERING SOME MORE TODAY...YOU CANT BEAT THE PRICE....MARK R.RALEIGH NC"
5,consistantly great,"Nothing I have found has ever equalled this cream for irregular skin tones. It works every time, all the time. Skin feels refreshed and smooth. Great product, a bit pricey but you do get what you pay for! A tube usally lasts me about 2 months. Highly recommended.."
2,doesn't so a thing for me?,"I have been using the ROC deep wrinkle night cream and wanted to try this since it has a better score on the hazardous cosmetics rating but it doesn't moisturize and it doesn't help my wrinkles, especially under my eyes. I would not recommend this, it is much too expensive and doesn't keep it's promises and doesn't moisturize my skin hardly at all."
4,High expectations,"I have been using Kinerase Lotion since January but I decided to try the cream version in early March. I didn't feel that the lotion was quite moisturizing enough for my neck and chest area, but it was appropriate for my face which is prone to breakouts. I have a sprinkling of sun damage on my cheek bones and a few fine lines around my eyes (I'm 44) so those were my initial target areas. The fine lines and freckle-like sun damaged areas have minimally improved but the overall texture of my skin has improved greatly and it also seems to have minimized the pores around my nose. It also somehow made my breakouts MUCH less frequent. As for the cream, it has only been a month since I started using it, but I really haven't seen any noticable improvement in the lines that I'm starting to get on my neck and chest. I suppose I expected a lot out of the product for the price but while I can't resoundingly recommend it, I would say that it is above average for its retexturizing ability."
3,"Love this cream, but price now too high.",PRICE TOO HIGH FOR PRODUCT. LOOK FOR SOMETHING ELSE. I have very very sensitive skin/mild rosacea and have been using this product for about a year. Recommended by my dermatologist. This is the only cream I have found that does not catch my face on fire or make my eyes water. I can't really say that its a miracle cream that makes you look longer or helps wrinkles but it definitely does moisturize very well and my skin is very soft! I use it every morning under makeup and every night before bed. Ships quickly. too bad it costs so much! I will look for something else.
3,ok,i have t-zone skin and thought that this product was not hydrating enough at all and i would definitely not get it again.
4,Really opens your eyes to the importance of restoring bison,"An excellent book. Callenbach clearing shows that he did his ""homework"". A must read for anyone who feels that bison should be reestablished on the American scene."
3,one great song,"Power of lard is awsome. The other two are sludgy drudgy, icky, slow boring long songs. Buy this and other lard, Cds than buy Dk CDs than buy all the Misfits Cds."
3,Nothing Special,"I have been studying tactics now for months on end, constantly, almost nothing but, to the point where I think I have had my eyes bleed. I went through this book in less than 2 hours, cover to cover. I found nothing new, but I really cannot complain loudly, as it did serve a purpose as tactical situations where I was able to apply what I hed read in other books. Most situations I solved in under a minute, and I am not a highly rated player by any stretch of the imagination. Let's put it this way, I think I can get a 4 digit USCF rating in 6 months of so if I keep putting effort in it. While for me it wasn't a very bad book, it just had nothing new in it for me. I had read everything in it before in a few other texts, but like I said, I was able to apply what I had learned in other books going through the puzzles."
5,An Electric Shock!,"A true exponent of Cape Verde music and culture, Tcheka aka <Manual Lopes Andrade> is a talent that brings a fresh approach to his work. In his American label debut (Four Quarters Entertainment) ""Nu Monda"" is as invigorating as it is enlightening. Tcheka's forceful voice along with his sense of style ensconces the listener into a world of colour and texture that only his native island can offer. This album will take you on a journey that will leave you wanting more with every play. The album is thoughtfully sequenced and flows freely from track to track. Job well done.Again not a project I have had the pleasure to work on but a must have for my own library."
5,Almost as good as live show,"I saw Tcheka when they toured with Cesaria this summer. The same beautiful, haunting sound comes across on CD. This voice is spectacular and the Island music is contagious. I'm no expert critic, but I'm glad I was able to locate this CD. I can't wait to hear more. I hope to see them live again."
4,Very Entertaining,"I thought this book was very humorous. I especially got a kick out of how shallow Cassandra was. My only complaint is that the plot could have moved along a little more quickly, but overall I would recommend it."
3,"Not her best, but I have read worse","This one if o.k. Not great mind you, but again, if you are going for brainless, kickback on vacation - it might get the job done."
3,Not her best,"I loved Wendy Holdens other two books, but I was disappointed in this one. While I do find some of the descriptive parts rather lengthy and tend to skim, I do like her characters, except with Bad Heir Day.I felt the characters were very basic. Things just seemed to happen without any real reason. The story lines just seemed to trug along without any real excitement. I did like the ending of the book where things finally started to pick up.Anna is such a basic character and you don't get to really dive into who she is. This book is more about people in motion and following a time line than getting to know characters."
3,Too Punny For Me,"I felt that both this book and Holden's writing style are only average. It seems that in trying so hard to be funny, Holden just keeps making obnoxious puns. She's much more Johnny Carson or Bob Hope than Helen Fielding. In addition, I thought that the story moved along at a nice pace throughout the majority of the book, then ended somewhat abruptly and predictably. The idea of the heir who may not be what he seems was a good one, but suffers in its execution."
2,Bad book to read,The story of Anna starts out slow and never really picks up. It is very predictable and a little on the boring side. I forced myself to finish it for lack of another book to read.
4,"Okay, okay, so it's obvious this was written on a deadline",", however, it's still hilarious and a good diverting read. I did find the pacing somewhat off - the romance that normally ""pans out"" at the end of this type of book isn't really here - the little romance that is there is not fleshed out enough that it's really believable, but I still enjoyed the read. There are some completely hilarious moments and I really don't think the puns are bad. I didn't kick myself for laughing at them. I think it's a rather original form of humor for fiction. The ""bad guys"" get their comeuppance and the ""good guys"" end up well. Don't give too much credence to the one-star review if you are someone who reads for fun. This is worth your time."
1,Painful,"I read the entire book in an attempt to justify having paid full price for it. It was a waste of time.The basic idea of the story (a satirical, pun-filled fairy tale) showed promise. However the characters were extremely shallow and unlikeable; particularly the drab, dopey, sponge-like heroine, Anna."
3,"Quick, fun read but don't expect too much","""Bad Heir Day"" is the classic beach book: entertaining, easy to read, fun and escapist. Heroine Anna gets dumped by her jerk of a boyfriend, secures a job as nanny to a hateful & spoiled ten-year-old, then flees her young charge by agreeing to marry a man she barely knows & live in his family's Scottish castle. As you can doubtless glean from this plot summary (and from the title of the book), Jane Austen this ain't. Yes, most of the characters are shallow stereotypes; the plot is unbelievable; the writing tries too hard to be clever; and worst of all, main character Anna comes across as a rather, well, boring and passive drip. But ""Bad Heir Day"" is still likeable and enjoyable, perhaps because it has no pretensions that it is any more than a fun, fast, fantasy-strewn read."
2,"Overdone, where is that great British humor?","A ""cute"" plot, would be bearable if Ms. Holden cut out about 80% of her attempts to be funny. Every cliche is used and the characters become tiresome after 20 pages. Ms. Holden must have found her literary inspiration in ""Friends"" or other similarly vapid shows."
1,Would rate zero stars if I could,I am usually a fan of British humour but this was just sad. Very bad book. Bridget Jones did it so much better.
1,Very Bad. Glad that I didn't pay for it,"Anna is a girl on the edge. She just been dump by her boyfriend Seb and now she has no place to go. But as luck would have it, bestselling romance writer Cassandra is in between nannies. Anna takes the job, thinking that Cassandra is going to teach Anna about being a writer. But Anna finds herself taking care of a child that Anna's thinks is the spawn of Satan. But suddnenly, on the third date, Anna finds a guy thats wants to marry her. What is Anna to do?I am so glad that I did not pay for this book! It was one of the worst book that I have read in along time. There were so many plotlines that there could have been at lease three books out of this one. I have to say that I would be hard press to read another book by Wendy Holden."
3,Entertaining Read,"I picked up a commonwealth version outside of the US. I loved Wendy's first book so much that I had to read this one.I would say that this one wasn't as funny as the first, but there were moments were I was laughing out loud. Espeically one photo shoot scene near the end of the book that I found espeically funny. I had to try to stop myself from looking totally weird laughing in the subway train. (still laughing if I think of it)Definately worth a read espeically if you're a fan. If you like brit humour, it's good as well."
4,Superb look at two giants of the musical theatre.,"Gene Lees's ""Inventing Champagne"" is a terrific look at the partnership that spawned ""My Fair Lady,"" ""Gigi"" and ""Camelot""--the collaboration between lyricist / librettist Alan Jay Lerner and composer Frederick Loewe. Based upon exhaustive research and hundreds of interviews, this is the only book that tells the story behind some of the greatest works ever written for either stage or screen. Lerner comes across as a supremely gifted neurotic; Loewe as equally gifted, and vastly arrogant, yet free of the wild ambitions and assorted personal problems that plagued the obsessive Lerner. An unlikely pairing, yet one that had few rivals in the creation of theatrical songs. Lees' readable, in-depth portrait of Lerner and Loewe is a fascinating, well-written book that is more than worth reading."
4,"Nice switch, but not the one pictured","The switch pictured is not what was delivered. Generac bought GenTran earlier this year, and apparently they have replaced the GenTran 301060 switch (pictured on AMAZON) with the switch from the Generac 6295 kit. It still has the GenTran Logo, but even the box has a picture that is different from what is inside. This was not a problem for me, as they are pretty much the same, but the meters are on the right and the Generator plug is on the top right of the box (shipped with cover installed and socket loose in the switch enclosure). You need to plan accordingly. I had no problems with the installation and everything was supplied."
5,electrican man,"This is excellent product,it was easy to instal and to use.I chose this product because some of the competing product have more wiring involved and it is possible to backfeed house power into your generator. I strongly recomended this product."
3,Seems for kids.,I have never tried it in the pool because the connectors were all too short. It wouldn't fit to my eyes. I think this goggle is not for adult.
4,An interesting and engaging read,"The fictitious memoirs of Nicholas Garrigan, personal physician to ex-Ugandan dictator Idi Amin. Garrigan passively recounts his own fall into moral ambivalence as he describes Amin's erratic, homicidal rule. A surprising and disturbing book -- at times we find ourselves liking psychopathic, murderous Idi Amin more than we do the nebbish and irresolute Dr. Garrigan. The prose is crisp and pleasurable to read; at times this novel looses its focus, but overall it's a moving and affecting book which takes us on a journey not only through the personal landscapes of Garrigan and Amin, but which also provides flashes of insight into African society and politics and European-African relations."
4,Dynamic debut,"I never heard of Giles Foden but his title and premise looked interesting so I gave it a try. What a find! His imagination is ripe for satire and dark humor which I devoured. The story of a Scottish doctor in the British foreign service who excepts Idi Amin Dada's invitation to become his doctor is at times droll, funny and horrifying. It encompasses most of Amin's reign including the Entebbe raid by the Israelis. Foden does a superb job of making Amin ruthless and charming. But Foden's best asset is that his novel is never predictable. Foden is an author I'd like to see write again."
2,Unbearable,"**This review pertains to the audiobook version, not the print version.**The narrator (Mirron Willis) does splendid voice characterizations for all of the characters -American, British, Ugandan... All except for the Scot, Nicholas Garrigan. Willis makes the Scottish doctor sound mildly retarded or speech-impaired (or both?). Unfortunately, since the doctor's voice predominates throughout the book, I just couldn't bear listening to the whole thing. Too bad..."
3,Boring.,"I was expecting a memoir about Idi Amin to be a little more eventful than this book. It was too detail oriented and got going way too slowly. The last hundred pages were great, but you have to wade through a lot before you get there."
1,Broke and Poor Warranty,"I received the clock radio in Decemeber as a gift and it stopped working within 3 months of use. When I tried to return it under warranty, they wanted me to pay half the cost of a new one to ship the old one back and receive a new one. Definitely not a good product or company."
1,Broke twice!,"2 1/2 months after I purchased this clock radio the time display stopped working. I returned it (with receipt) and traded it for a new one, thinking it was just a fluke. Unfortunately, 2 1/2 months later the same problem happened again, with the alarm going off at crazy times. Too bad, it's a cute, compact little unit, but I'm not willing to try again a third time."
2,Good. . .While It Lasted,"No wonder this product is ""no longer available."" It's because it's no good.Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed this alarm clock while it was working - I had an alarm schedule all set up and could wake up to radio, my alarm, a CD or Nature Sounds. It was a good alarm clock to have - but only if you only want a ""short term"" alarm clock.This morning, I walked in my room to hear garbled radio playing. The display on th clock wasn't working and none of the buttons would change anything. I finally just had to unplug it. It was broken and there was no way to fix it.It seems as though others have had this problem, so it looks like Memorex just made a crappy product and they knew about it, so they're not selling it anymore. You can't even find this alarm clock on their website.Way to go, Memorex! You've just lost yourself a customer."
2,Ergonomic Nightmare,"This product works functionally. However it's design is very difficult to use. First of all, the volume works both for the alarm and the radio. So, if you want to listen to the radio quietly the alarm will be too soft to wake you up. Secondly, the dial is waaaay too bright. Even on the ""dim"" setting it lights up the whole room. Finally, look at that row of buttons on the top. Are you going to be able to figure out how to turn off the alarm? If your fingers are ultrasensitive you *may* be able to find the row of buttons but to know that you're pushing the right one is impossible.I used this for maybe a week before throwing it away. Like I said, this product does work, but take a close look at it and think about how you'll use it before you buy."
3,much smaller than expected,"This item was packed in large size box but inside in a very small box, much smaller than we expected. Was very pretty"
2,Michigan sticker looks to be riped away.,The emblem at the bottom that projects like a mirror is missing about 25% of the picture. Not sure how this was not caught by quality control?
4,I am Recovering,"As a teenager with depression I selected this book, not knowing what it was like. Well I started to read it and it all made sence. Every chapter focuses on a differnt part of depression, what it does or what you can do. Some things seem a little easy for an older teenager, bur still helpful. I see that as being able to help all adolcents, at differnt ages. Easy to read and easy to understand."
5,pete fountain presents dixieland,"Firsy rate dixieland. REally enjoyed it. Featured musiicians aren't li ited to Pete... there's a pretty good trumpet, too."
3,Okay...,"I first saw the anime, which I loved, via fansubs (I hope it gets licensed) so I asked my for and received the first three volumes of this series for my birthday. It's okay... but I thought that the anime was much better. This manga has gorgeous, adorable art, but aside from that it feels a bit rushed and the characterization is kind of shallow compared to the anime. This manga is cute, but the anime even pulls off cuteness more convincingly... it's hard to describe (and kind of strange sincew this manga spawned the anime). ^^;; I would recommend the anime in a heartbeat, but I just don't care for the manga version. There's much better shoujo manga out there. Two excellent titles that I recommend are Ouran High School Host Club and W Juliet. Even though it's not shoujo, I still must recommend Fullmetal Alchemist! XD"
4,Its tasty but i dont think it is healthy,I like this coco puff bars.However i dont think having it as a snack everyday would be healthy.However these bars are trully ddelicious and i guess having one or two a week wont hurt.So i guess you should try this product out and see if you like it.
5,Breathtaking views of New York,"I am not a big buyer of ""coffee table books"" but I made an exception for this one. The photographer is the brother of a boyhood friend of mine (Richard, if you're reading this, tell Jim I said hello!) and I got the book for my parents as a gift. I spent hours pouring over the incredible pictures thinking time and time again, HOW did he take THAT? I can only describe the pictures as breathtaking, sumptuous, and evocative of a New York that is all too easy to take for granted if you've lived in it. The pictures here make you see it anew."
2,This is a mini book,"Make sure this is what you want. The editors description described this book as a full size 12x14 picture book, which is what I was looking for, so I bought it. I neglected to read the actual product description which stated it was a mini, 4x6 size. I was disappointed, and subsequently returned the book, as it was a gift."
4,the bible of Bordenites who think Lizzie did it,"This account of the Borden murders by Victoria Lincoln is sometimes based on conjecture and has its errors; also sources are usually not cited. However, it's extremely informative in fact, quite plausible in theory, and probably the most entertaining Lizzie book in the non-fiction category. It won the Best Fact Crime Book award in 1967.David Rehakauthor ""Did Lizzie Borden Axe For It?"""
5,A Private Disgrace,"The best book ever written about the Lizzie Borden murder case. Authored by a Fall River resident who, as a child, knew and spoke with Borden, this book offers perhaps the only true glimpse of the alleged murderess that modern day readers can hope to obtain. The author includes details that other writers can only gain from secondary sources, such as what Lizzie's personality was like, her eating habits and even the 19th century rituals that went with menstrual cycle. If you are fascinated by the Lizzie Borden murders case, you have to read this....otherwise, you know nothing about the case."
5,Buffalo Bill Collector's Guide,"A very good reference for any Buffalo Bill Cody collector, great photos and descriptions. Only wish there was an updated version!"
2,Magik or Heavy Metal?,"A winning album cover attracted by curiousity. The quiet songs are lovely and the female voice most beautiful. However, when the heavy metal tunes numbered over three, I gave it a thumbs down. Half of the Cd is great but the other half wracks my nerves."
3,not the best but still worth it.,"press the spacebar is a little more experimental than the past albums by COS, but one also has to consider that COS was working with another band nameed Noheads. This collabration has created an interesting collection of songs. If you do appreciate Chicks on Speed I would suggest to buy this album, but i am warning you some songs are a hard listen (especially the last three songs) but the the first part is pretty good and my friend also suggests not to listen to this while driving. The better songs on this album are Tracks 1,2,3,4,7 (i would buy this album used or half off the regular price since you might just end up listening to half the record."
2,ok..... what?,"so this is pretty crappy. maybe it's a response to the overly-commercial-sounding ""99 cents"". it's mostly a bunch of b.s. ""ambient"" ""experimental"" music with some random vocals thrown in. very disappointing. there are a few ok moments, but ultimately just pass on this one. it sounds like wierd demos. i don't know who ""the noheads"" are, but suffice to say the record does, in fact sound like it was recorded by people with no heads."
4,Wonderful DVD But Pity It's not Blu Ray yet !!!,These ladies are simply marvelous !!! Just wondering why they still did not release any on Blu Ray ...... but then again it is still a good dvd to own.
4,Celtic Woman Songs from the Heart,"Songs From The HeartThe sound quality is great on this DVD but the video quality is poor, with kind of a filmy quality. It doesn't measure up to past works by Celtic Woman."
2,A Good Reason To Cheat,I recorded this to Hi-Def DVD from PBS (minus the money-begging) and also downloaded it 'illegally'. I came here to purchase it but after reading the reviews I will stick to my 'free' versions! I will gladly pay for a quality product but this doesn't seem like one.
5,Excellent!,"Celtic Woman, backed by an awesome orchestra and offering up mostly traditional Irish music, is far and away the best of both voice and instruments ever assembled. The voices of the lead singers are the purest I have ever heard. Celtic Woman also features a fiddler that is nothing less than an amazing talent in her own right. Any Celtic Woman cd/dvd is a must have for those that love music."
5,tim j 12,The visual content is very attractive and goes well with the songs that were with the DVD. I hope in the future that there will be more DVD and CD from them.
2,Sub Par Recording,"I assume that everyone has seen the performance on PBS so I won't review the material itself. But, if you are buying this DVD to relive the experience, you'll be sorely disappointed. Overall, the quality of the recording is comparable to an old VHS tape. The audio is similar to vinyl. No Dolby, no 5.1, no nada. Just plain old two channel stereo with drop outs. The video is on a par with VHS (480i), certainly not nearly as good as the PBS presentation. If I did not know better, I'd think that this a knock-off from the back alleys of Hong Kong.In addition, the extras (The making of...) are minimal and certainly do not add measureably to the experience.Bottom line, record your PBS station and send the money to them.p.s. This DVD was played on Samsung Blu-Ray with 1080p up-converting feeding a 54"" 1080P Plasma. Sound was fed via optical cable to a Sony Master digital receiver driving a Klipsch theater speaker system."
3,"Great music, great production, RUINED by POOR DVD encoding!!!!","Hello folks,My review is not on the Celtic Woman concert or music, they're excellent!! What compelled me to write a review is the DVD itself. I'm only a few seconds into the dvd and I paused it wondering what is wrong with my dvd player. The video quality is quite poor. I have a better resolution recording of the PBS special in standard def from my TV antenna! I've already compared them. This dvd should never have made it past quality control.My greatest hope is someone creates a Bluray!If there's ever been content that begs to be released in HD, it's the grandeur and beauty of the Celtic Woman's productions. The scenery, costumes, and stages are amazing!Everyone cross your fingers or email for a Bluray!"
2,Great performance but...,"I was warned before by other reviewers, but I was eager to own this DVD in my collection, because it is not available here in Europe.The performance and stage presentation is great as usual (I saw them live last year). But the visual quality of this DVD is far from ""state of the art"". It looks like an old VHS cassette. Maybe this is the reason, why it is not on market here? I hope there will be a better release soon."
1,Bad Production,"The DVD was great but it had productio defects(blips) in more than one location.I tried twice to get a good DVD and never was succsesful. I still do not have a DVD of Celtic Woman,Songs From The Heart.You should know thar I will not order DVD's from Amazon again."
5,Celtic Woman Songs from the heart,This is a fantastic video. It is one of my favorites and I would recomment it to anyone. I am real partial to Amazing Grace. I think they do a great job on it.
5,Uplifting,"A friend loaned us their DVD and we loved it so much we ordered it for ourselves. The voices, instruments and scenery were outstanding. This is music we will enjoy over and over again."
4,Celtic Women-Songs from the Heart,Another good DVD of the Celtic Women in an open air concert. Thier thanks to fans of the USA attending in Ireland was enduring and very nice. Have been a fan of the group since 2005.
3,Kind of Dongish,Great Cd if you're 80 years old and love this type of stuff. Some of the bims are cute though.Dey have good voices.
1,Songs of the Heartburn,"Apparently assembled in the UK equivalent of Stepford, this gaggle of pretty girls has managed to water down centuries of authentic Celtic folk song into something about as tasty as plain yogurt. Everything unpleasant, complex, challenging or profound has been removed, and the result is yet another assembly line collection of musical drivel for PBS to use as bait in their endless quest for funds and to provide a gullible public with yet another excuse to throw away their money."
2,"Good music, lousy production quality","Unfortunately, like many others here, I was disappointed by the overall quality. I really like Celtic Woman, and I'm really saddened by this poor of quality on one of their products."
3,charming,"Before Marta (aka Martha) Eggerth went to star in two Judy Garland pictures For Me and my Gal and Presenting Lily Mars, she starred in musicals in her homeland. Unlike the MGM movies here she plays a sweet girl and not an obnoxious one.Two singers who aspire to make it in opera meet. The man manages to get to the top of the field while the girl unbeknownst to him is dying. This manages to incorporate a modern day seeting with a similar plot and music of La Boheme. It seems like the subtitles are picked and chosen. But I still give kudos to Allegro for releasing films like these. A year later after this movie Jan Kiepura and Marta married."
3,Not original recordings,This album is a collection of songs that were re-recorded by Ricky Nelson in the 1990s. The orignal recordings are better. I thought they were the originals so I was somewhat dissapointed.
1,Very Disappointed,"I ordered this C.D. thinking it was the original recordings.When I received this CD, I opened it and put in the CD player andwas disappointed to hear that the songs had all been re-recorded.They don't sound the same as the original recordings.If I had known this was CD was re-recorded I would not have opened it. I would have sent it back."
1,Very Poor,I wish I had read the other review prior to buying this cd - it's truly a piece of trash. I've thrown it out. Save your money.
4,good collection for the money,I liked it. You really have to listen close to tell they were re-recorded. The background music is identical. The selection of songs is great
1,Sux,This book is well written but tells me nothing about how to use Store Editor. I've spent hours reading the book with Store Editor open in front of me and I still can't get it to work like he says it will.Store Editor is the worse program I've ever tried to use. It's very cryptic and navigation is illogical. I can use Dreamweaver but not Store Editor.GB
5,One of the best investments for my Yahoo Store,"I think this book is an indispensible tool for the Yahoo Store Owner. Thank you Mr. Snell for writing such an easy to read book that actually covers so many important topics for the Yahoo Store owner. I have been running my Yahoo Store business for 7 years and unfortunately, I only found out about this book recently. Oh well, better late than never! Thanks again."
5,Great tips to make more money with your website!,I bought a book for each of my employees and developers. You can learn so much from these tips Rob provides. Just implementing one change to your yahoo store can reap thousands of dollars of sales.Thanks for writing this book!
4,"Practical, actionable info","For the longest time I put off buying this book. I just didn't feel I needed another text full of technical terms and theoretical info. Finally, I gave in and bought the book. I'm sorry that I waited as there is so much ""real life"" advice in there. I've made a number of changes to my site and expect to see improved conversions and organic search rankings.My only complaint is that because of the ""dummies"" format, a lot of space/time is spent on basic explanations. I'd like more real world checklists and advice for the ""intermediate"" store owner. Rob Snell has such a wealth of knowledge, this book only taps the surface."
4,Sensible Helpful Book,I used this book to start my business. I thought the book gave good and sensible advice and I recommend it for someone who is starting a business where good record keeping is important.
4,"Full of into, but technology ages, books don't..","This book is packed with everything from how to HTML to small minuet details to running your yahoo business. It's a essential book to have if your starting a yahoo business. Though some information might be a bit outdated. Still, great starting place."
5,Yahoo Business for Dummies,"All I can tell you is that once I had this information I immediately started saving almost $8,000 a month on my pay per click charges while substantially increasing my sales.Rob Snell is an internet genius!Buy this book."
5,this is a great book !!!,"this book is very useful to people who just get into the online business especially you have a YAHOO store , its worth every penny you paid !!!"
4,Extremely helpful,"I still have doubts that we will keep our stores on the Yahoo for very long but if we were to keep them there it would be because of this book.The author does a great job of explaining: 1) what you should be doing as a store owner, 2) why you should be doing it and 3) how you go about doing it. No where can you find a resource that provides all three of those.I know it's hard to keep print pieces up to date with technology. The book is somewhat dated. I would love to see him bring out a new edition. That said, it is still an extremely helpful resource.If you run a Yahoo store then you would be an idiot to not own this book."
1,This video is a cover up for pornography,"I like to watch programs about pimps and hoes. This was supposed to be one of those programs. It was not. The only thing that was shown were individual women for about 10, rubbing and touching all over themselves! I told myself that I do not want to see some bitches touching on themselves! I wrote the place where I bought this video and they refunded my money. Thanks to them. But, do not even buy this crap unless you want to watch women touch themselves and get off on themselves."
2,No Good,The sprayer arrived double boxed in a couple of days. I unpacked it and it appeared to be fine so I put it in my shed. When I went to use it a month later I discovered the control handle & nozzle were defective because it WILL NOT shut off. Chemicals all over the place and all over me.Naturally my 30-day return period had passed and I couln't be more pissed off with Hudson. Piece of crap right out of the box!Thaks
2,The Skinny on this book,"I love this type of book, I always get the feel that I am reading someones personal diary, but this book was okay, I liked Mr Instability better for the job stories and it was hilarious, I liked I hope they serve beer in hell because it was raw!"
5,This book rules,"Hilarious, insightful, even poignant. I highly recommend it to anyone and am purchasing copies for each niece and nephew upon graduation from high school. This book provides a great reminder of what real work looks like and why college seems like a pretty good life path."
5,great,"for anyone who's worked meaningless jobs before, it is nice to know someone else out there has had more than you, and also feels just as worthless."
2,It's all about choices,"This book was interesting but midway through the book I wanted to tell him to get a real life and job in his educational background. Sadly, I felt he never really achieved his real ability and just had a lot of excuses."
4,Well written and entertaining,"This was a book I found to be very entertaining. It is pretty short so it is not too much of a time commitment. It does not describe all 42 (30/9/3) jobs that the title suggests, it just goes into detail on several (maybe six or seven, I can't remember for sure) of the jobs from fishing in Alaska to working for a moving company and working for a high end grocery store. An easy read that is worth the time, pretty funny book."
5,True Blue's Dead on,"I use these series of levels for tilework. I pull allot of mud by hand and EM71 are perfect. No where forconcrete to get into the levels, cleanup easily, and when I have to put in an occasional shower door themagnets make it allot easier. The screw hanging holes on both sides of the level are beefy and hold upto the wear and tear of reuse. If your concerned about empire being a low end product, don't be. Thesestack up against anything german I've run across, and for a much better price!"
5,a must have!,"This is the best book for learning about the Central California coast and the animals that are found here.It is easy to read and full of great information, drawings and photos.Everytime I go beach combing and wonder what something is, I can find it with lots of great information about it in this book."
2,Way too big to be a small,"I ordered this as a replacement - the exact same style number and size I already have. It is about six inches longer and waaay wider, the manufacturer must have changed it. Very disappointing as I am a small woman and cannot find a safety vest that isn't longer than my shorts. Otherwise, the quality is good."
1,musica buena,"I was in a party, it was kind of quiet but when they started this cd it got going. I have several cd from this group they are great. Most of the songs have the Mania signature music style."
4,I wish she'd come back!,"I absolutely love New York. This was the better season. Season 1 was entertaining but Season 2 absolutely takes the cake. Either way, New York delivers non stop entertainment."
1,Very disappointed!,"Have purchased this product at local mall previously. Unfortunately, my purchase with this seller was not as expected. Sent message to seller in regards to the spray portion being broken and never received anything. Just wanted to exchange item for a working one. Very disappointed."
1,stinks!,"Awful perfume. If you don't like perfume that people can smell from a distance, stay away from this one! Got a sample of this and one spray on one wrist later I was sorry. People near me at work were asking what that smell was, it was aggravating their sinuses."
2,perfume,I thought I was buying a spray bottle but it was actually a refill bottle. Wife wasn't happy had to then go and buy a spray bottle.. Pain in the butt. Gave me wrong product.
5,Gimme gimmie gimmie!!!!,"I absolutely love this perfume! It smells great, and it tastes sweet. It doesn't last all day, but I don't know of any perfume that does. I also purchased the lip glosses, and like them alot too."
1,One star is too much!,"Box was damaged, like a ""rejected product"" box. The bottle itself had grinder marks on it where something was ground off. The scent is anything but angleic."
1,Headache & nausea,"I had read so many reviews about this and was stunned not to love it. The first thing I noticed: a sudden onset of what felt surprisingly akin to car sickness. This has a undertone of Avon Skin So Soft blended with some hippie house patchouli. Overwhelming. Smells like a bad karaoke bar with a lot of velvet inside.I waited for the middle notes to come out because some folks said only the top notes clashed. They said after that it was ""heavenly."" It didn't get any better. I tried wearing it to bed and found that I hated it so much that I woke up with my pajama top on the floor. Apparently I hated it so much that I tried to get it off while I was asleep. Yikes!"
1,defective product - poor customer service,"The Perfume arrived on time. It is brown (supposed to be light blue) and smells bad. This is my wife's favorite perfume for 10 years, so we know what it is supposed to smell like. It looks like it is old / and or the prodcut was frozen.Have contacted seller several times to return at their expense. Not responsive. Do not do business with this group."
2,"Received open package, February 29, 2012","I received the package in a timely fashion, but had reservations about the item itself. The package was sent with plastic bags you use receive from a grocery store as packing material. I still have the plastic bag to prove it. To make matters worse, the item was opened, which presents the question, is this legitimate. This is for a birthday present for my children's mother, so my concern is related to her health. Is it safe to use this product? I would like a response from the company guaranteeing that the item is legitimate. Otherwise, I would like to return the item.My concern is not about the product, for I have purchased similar Angel items for her without any issue, but with the company fulfilling the order I placed on Amazon."
4,Very Nice,Love this perfume. The scent is not that great when you first spray it on. But after a few minutes it smells wonderful! The only problem is it doesn't seem to last very long.
1,angel by Thierry Mugler for Women plus small purse size,"The bottle of Thierry Mugler Eau De Parfum arrived as advertised & ordered, as did the small purse size. I was charged $3.95 for the small purse size and upon receiving it, the small size read ""Sample NOT FOR SALE"". That was a ripoff and I am very disappointed and will not deal with them again."
1,fake smells awful,It smells awful and they won't let me return it. Don't buy this product!!! I am so disappointed. I can't believe this got so many good reviews.
4,Attractive ballet music from the compser of Giselle.,"Adolphe Adam had a gift for writing appealing ballet music. His most famous ballet score, Giselle, is a widely-acknowledged masterpiece. La Jolie Fille de Gand is not up to the high standard set by Giselle, but not many ballet scores are. Nevertheless, La Jolie Fille de Gand -- which was composed shortly after Giselle -- is quite pleasant and appealing in its own way. The conductor, Andrew Mogrelia, clearly has an affection for Adam's charming ballet music. If you give this delightful 2-CD set a chance you may share his affection."
4,Buddha gives you no candy,"One of several books about Zen which I read before actually experiencing Zen meditation, this book stands out as one of the best in communicating the stops, starts, mistakes and rewards of a spiritual quest. The author begins as a secular Jew whose father was a spiritual seeker and who constantly exposed the family to new gurus during the mid-20th Century -- often to comical effect. Eventually the author decides to give Zen Buddhism the old college try, and his experiences are funny, insightful as he gives a fair picture of studying with several different teachers. After he develops a friendship with one teacher in Greenwich Vilage, the author relates many conversations in which the Zen master, with humor and equanimity, tries to untangle his student's anxieties and delusions.Once I actually began practicing Zen meditation, I felt this book, more than most others, provided a well-balanaced picture of what it's really like to approach and try to practice Zen."
4,Interesting Book,This book peeked my interest when i realized it was about Master Min Pai. There are a few chapters about him towards the end of the book.
4,Pricey but vegan,No horses were harmed in the making of these capsules. That made me pay the almost crazy high price for these. They are packed well and kept dry as they should be so the vendor is trying to do a good job here. I just wish they were a little cheaper. I use them for some Chinese herbs which can taste pretty bad so these capsules are almost a necessity.
4,Pretty good if painting for the fun of it,"These paints have turned out to be a great deal of fun. With my small set of ""real"" acrylics I am always wary of using them up. But with these huge pints of paint, I have no problem about using them because there is plenty - so I am less inhibited. I am not a professional artist, but paint for fun, and for that, these are fine.To the previous reviewer, if you are painting on wood it is a good idea to use 2 or 3 coats of gesso first, otherwise the wood will just soak up the paint.Anyway, these are cheap acrylics made for non-serious work. And for that, they are great."
3,Gary Owen- Breaking Out of the Park,I liked Gary Owen as host of BET's Comic View. He did not disappoint. Entertaining...
5,Fantastic,"I love this album, the beats are smooth and the tracks flow nicely from one to another. If you are a fan of their stuff, definitely worth a buy"
3,"Like Their Name, It Can Get Repetitive","Saw these guys on some weird late night, local type TV show and was intrigued enough to pick up the album. Pleased I did, as there are some ""classic"" tunes here. ""Lex"" and ""Loud Pipes"" are the two best tracks on the album. ""Wildcat"" is right there too. Head-bobbers all the way. ""Montanita"" has a nice vibe to it for an opener, ""Tropicana"" has a similar laid back feel.The problem here is that after a while the songs get the same feel to them. It's a good album to put on for background music, because some songs will catch you off guard and get you grooving (See above said songs). Hard to listen to all the way through, it might put you into a coma."
3,Good Beat box type music,"I decided I *needed to buy this CD based on the strength of one of the songs on the CD, Loud Pipes. I really love this song, and I recommend others to it. However, the CD is a little pricey to buy based on the strength of one song. A few of the others have grown on me since I've owned this CD, but not many."
2,Kind of boring,"This book did not hold my interest. It was kind of boring. In fact I still haven't finished reading it, and I have had it for 1 year! I read over 500 words a minute, but I haven't been compelled to finish!"
3,ALL BARKER NO BITE!,"I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Barker on two separate occasions, and I found him to be quite charming; considering the type of stories he writes, (blood and gore,)you would never have expected him to be that way.This happens to be my 3rd Barker book and I found it to be the best, however it wasn't very good. I think Mr. Barker has good intentions, but I feel his antagonists to be gruesomely silly. I feel as though the story, meanders a bit then he will throw in a bit of gore so you won't get board.Now don't get me wrong there were moments where I couldn't wait to see what happened next, then when something finally does happen; I then couldn't wait to get it over with. He is ok, but I still like Stephen King, Peter Straub, Anne Rice & Dean Koontz better.Now I will still read his books, because I like the plots on the jackets, and I respect him for being a regular guy in person and not a stuck up celebrity."
2,"Strong beginning, but fizzles at the end","This book has an excellent premise, but poor execution. There are some great moments, the prolouge and Marty's first encounter with the Last European are classic Barker, however the book waffles and comes to an end without fully explaining some major points in the book. The story's major weakness is it's ambiguity. While I do appreciate that aspect in most literary protagonists, it's simply too much here and the characters are ultimately unsympathetic. Nice effort, but Barker has handled better in other books. Also the reader comes away a descriptive defintion of coprophagia which, please forgive the pun, may not be to everyones taste. The Damnation Game is very good macabre. But the book is all technique and lacks the passion found in Thief of Always and Weaveworld."
2,2nd boring book I've read from barker,"I started with Imajica , which pales in comparison to t The Stand and The Talisman even though the story is more complex than both of those. After reading Damnation Game,, I'm starting to wonder if Barker can carry a Theme all the way through. He's wonderful at creating an amazing topic and subperb at giving horrific details of events, But this book, like Imajica left me wondering, WHY???? he seems to take another great story and makes it pointless by the time you finish the book. This is my third read from him and I have two other books I need to read. They better get better or Mr.Barker won't get anymore purchases from me."
3,Barker BEFORE he refined his excellent writing skills,"What is all the fuss about? This book, although somewhat enjoyable, is by no means a knockout. If you are like me and can't stand wasting time reading anything but the best, you probably won't like this book. It drags and the story isn't all that interesting to begin with. (Remember the movie Nightbreed by Barker?) However, if you really don't demand much from a novel and like your books to flow like a good all-around movie, read away.This is no where near Barker's best work. Writing doesn't get much simpler than this. (Compare it to The Great and Secret Show and, ideas aside, you would think it was a totally different writer)Still, I will give it this: I did finish it. But then again, being one of his first full-length novels, I wasn't really expecting much to begin with. I started reading because I was curious to what it was about. Sadly, by the end of the book I was still wondering."
4,Good and solid.,"The Damnation Game was a pretty solid book from Clive Barker. I've often found him to be better with short fiction than with full length novels, but this book delivered. It did drag on a bit in the middle. He can go overboard on some of his descriptions but the end picked back up. I would defintely recomend this book to fans of Barkers but maybe not for someone who is new to Barker. For those, pick up the Books of Blood."
5,Outstanding!,"I won't write an essay here, there are glowing ones aplenty as it is, I just wanted to add my voice and say that I picked this paperback up not expecting much...but this guy can really write. Seriously, way above average. More like poe than stephin king. Damn good."
5,Barker delivers Horror to the needy masses,"Clive Barker supercedes the attempts of other pop horror writer, by tomenting the real and imagined areas in your brain by somehow transporting them to a playing field all his own to give us, his readers, an glimpse into the treasures of his mind."
4,"An adult, modern, adventure - more fun than fear","Reading throught this book I couldn't help but think of this more as an adult, modern day, Huck-Fin adventure than a horror story. There were gross bits of course. But along with this came a lot of fantasy, and a belief in the main character that I couldn't shake. I enjoyed this book overall, and I can't wait to dig my teeth into more of the author's more fantastical books.An another note, Barker's sex scenes are much better than King's. Every time a sex scene come's up in a King novel, I say ""Oh God, not again."""
3,Average work compared to his short stories,"Humdrum, maybe near boring. I know I am going to get into a lot of trouble out there for this dissenting opinion but i just dont think this book is one of Barker's best, nor even that interesting. The writing was as solid as ever and the plot was interesting, but the story, the way the plot unfolded, just didnt grab me. It probably has to do with the immortal guy completely wasting his power and immortality. At least it seemed so to me.Blah, it just wasnt good. Read the Books of Blood if you are trying to get into Barker, skip this."
2,SLOOOOooooowwww!!,"After reading this book, I almost can't believe that it's the same author that wrote Weaveworld and The Hellbound Heart! What started out as an interesting novel with a great and creative concept, was slowly dragged, and dragged, and dragged on WAY TOO LONG until it's creativity soon fizzled out. Honestly, if I were writing this book I would have chopped several hundred pages off the end of it. It's as though he through in a bunch of filler just to have a nice, thick novel to show off. Skip it! And skip Coldheart Canyon too!"
3,Not Quite As Great As Everyone Says,"The Damnation Game is definitely a book I'd call unique. Even though I've read some of Clive Barker's other books and have enjoyed his movies, I'm not going to heap praises on this book just because it's his first like so many others have done. It is original, to be sure. It also has some really twisted imagery. The characters aren't too bad but they could have been a bit deeper, especially the villains.This is one of thos books that has a great set up but fails to deliver in the end. I kept anticipating some wild stuff to go down at the end but it just kind of fizzled out almost like Mr. Barker got tired of writing and wanted to end the book.Overall, I would say that The Damnation Game is a must read for die-hard Barker fan. It has a good plot that has true substance. It is, however, a slow read. Someone with only a passing interest in Clive Barker would probably enjoy something like Cabal or The Books Of Blood."
3,Sometimes brilliant; sometimes silly ...,"I had mixed feelings about this book. It started pretty well, pretty deep, but towards the middle it looses momentum. We can never exactly figure out what are the reasons of Mamoulian. Marty Strauss is really a great character, but is plagued by having to share his room with the old cliche of an ambiguos and insecure beautiful female main character, whose only job is to give incomplete answers and put the heroe in trouble. The end of the history is original in the terror genre, having a happy ending . Anyway, Barker can write as few people can, and it is a good book to start with."
2,Barely worth finishing.,"While this isn't amoung the worst books I've ever read, it is one of the worst that I ever finished. As an avid fan of the horror genre, I was anxious to enjoy the first novel of the writer everyone was talking about. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I found myself hoping that it would get a little worse so I could justify not finishing it."
3,"absolutely disgusting, but oddly intriguing","Folks, don't eat before reading this book. It truly made me sick to my stomach. I am truly amazed at the way Clive Barker can describe gore...This is the first book of his that I have read, and I was not all that impressed. The plot is really choppy, and at times it really drags. However, it is absolutley unique, and when it actually get s scary, it is SCARY. Barker sure does have imagination, but the book could have been written better."
2,Too little information for such a large product,"I have been studying this book for over a year,and though I have gotten to feel like I know my way around a Cache system, only been working with it a year (MUMPS too for that matter), there is too much information, Undocumented (WOLF KOELING<SP?> will agree that Intersystems offers not to divulge. The book hits all the basics. Devices, servers, clients, GUI tools, $ZU hell, CSP, but with 15 pages to use per section it has to try and describe it, thats not quite enough. ALl in all its helpful, though, my advice is to ditch the book and read the newsgroup. People are very willing to help there."
1,Waste of $4,I through these away after one attempted use. They hurt going in and were way to big. Also the catch string is made of cloth so it would have been hard to clean even if I kept them.
1,ouch!,These were a little bit difficult to use and a bit painful too. You really need to use a lot of lubrication in order to fully use this product & it's just a pain because they're too big as well. Even a little bigger than the gold balls. sorry! smaller is better for ben wa balls.
2,Does Not Work With Me,"I figured this would be a good tool to practice vaginal exercises with. The balls are very difficult to get in. In fact, I was only able to get one in...with lube... and the other always hung out. No matter what I did, these things were NOT interested.I retired them quickly... jade eggs and kegelcisors ladies!!"
5,"A very creative, guided journal","This book lends many ideas for journaling. From ""My Most Precious Possession"" to ""People Who Give Me Hope."" It is in a ""guided"" journal format, and is very easy to use. The soft-bound cover makes for convenient use. Excellent source for those who wish to record their precious time on this earth."
5,Much better than I expected.,"I originally rented this movie thinking it was going to be my B movie for the week. I love to rent bad ones and get a giggle out of the cheesiness, but I was pleasantly surprised on how good this one is. Starts out a little slow, but it had me and my family laughing hard several times. The ax scene is the best. Not everyone is going to like this, but if you like vampires and goofiness you well like this. And even I compare it to Shaun of the Dead which I liked also. And for the guys out there plenty of chicks for you with the whole lesbian theme."
3,A hoot (despite the title change),"For some unknown reason this US release abridges the original UK title of the movie from 'Lesbian Vampire Killers' to merely 'Vampire Killers'. LVK perfectly communicates what to expect from the film, tongue-in-cheek, over-the-top comedy/horror.While it doesn't equal them, it's agreeably influenced by the 2nd and 3rd Evil Dead movies and Shaun of the Dead as well as the cheese-fest horror exploitation from the 70's. Don't expect character development. It's all intentionally 2-D. James Corden plays it loose as a slightly more extreme version of his 'Smithy' character from 'Gavin & Stacey' and Paul McGann does a nice turn as the vicar. He actually hops up and down in frustration when his voice of authority is questioned. The name of the vampire queen Carmilla is a nice nod to the 1872 vampire tale of the same name which did indeed involve a lesbian vampire It's not earth-shattering but it's fun."
4,Stupid but funny.,"Lesbian vampire killers;What can I say. The story is not mega good, the vampires are not scary and it`s not a horror.But the story works, the vampires are funny and it`s a verry funny horror.I`ll putt it like this; I`ll keep it in my collection. It deserves to be there."
2,All jugs and jugulars,"Claydon's homage to the bawdy British comedy romp is mediocre fare. The script is uneven and, although there are a few laughs along the way, its not notably funny. The cast do their best and it does have its moments, but it would have benefited from better writing. This is, of course, meant to be tawdry nonsense, and on that level it is fairly successful. So, just watch, enjoy (to a point), and forget."
2,not worth the money,Glad I watched this movie at a friends house using their netflix because it so isn't worth the money. It isn't even that easy to mist because the movie is trying to be funny..
2,Poor excuse for entertainment,There were a few good one liners which I wish they would have grouped into a short segment. That way I could have spared myself from the rest of this dreadful movie.
3,Waste of Beauties,"During an extended run of monotonous feature titled ""Lesbian Vampire Killers"" outside the USA, sexy gals express steady desire for eating the every human being available to power their steady group-foreplay while a brave local prist lead resistance to mercilessly demolish this bloodthirsty tribe.Such waste of the beauties as not much shown at all, makes a reviewer just wondering at himself for his ""investment"" in this product."
2,Really overrated.,"In some places, the ""comedy"" is a bit too subtle to be comedy, and in other places, it's just plain crass or disgusting. The only reason anyone should really buy this movie is if they're looking for something with hot girls in it, because that's the only redeeming quality it really has."
4,Good B Movie Fun,"If you remember this is SUPPOSED to be a B movie than it is great. If you looking for Academy Award winning acting, forget it! Took 1 star off just because hey its a B movie."
2,Poor Quality,"My three children like the music, but the quality is terrible. Not only does it give the feeling of being taped over one too many times, but the toys and props used also give it an old-timey feeling, which isn't pleasant. I had read such nice reviews and was really disapointed. There are a lot better dvd's to purchase than this one."
1,Cheesy at best,"I don't write a lot of reviews, but this DVD is so bad I wanted others to save their money. I purchased this DVD at a $5 clearance sale at walmart and felt I paid too much for it! It is the most amateur attempt at film-making I've ever seen-anyone with a video camera could do a better job. The ""set"" looks like a simple table top with a fabric drape. The main character is a simple hand puppet which always shows up from the side (ie. no appropriate puppet stage is used.) The whole movie is a series of random scenes of toys-most look like they've been purchased at the dollar store. But what I found a bit disturbing is the scene where they set up a hot plate to melt ice into water in a pan. I'm not sure I want my kids getting the message that it's OK to play with the stove. If I could have given this 0 stars I would have done so-I can't believe others have rated it so highly. (...)."
5,LOVE this!,My girls are four years old and still LOVE this video. Is it a little different than other baby/ kid videos? Yes. But I think that's why they still love it. They pretend to BE Dookie and Dottie. Nonstop :) Our DVD is worn out!
1,What a rip off,"I purchased this for Christmas for our new baby. Not only was the quality horrible, it repeated over and over on text on the screen ""FOR SCREENING PURPOSES ONLY"""
1,it never worked,"Either its a DOA or it just don't work ive installed it on 3 different PCs and I on image tried to change some setting tried new drivers but nothing no image at all not even when useing my IM programs, the pc knows it's there but still nothing,well at least the lights on it work work."
1,False Advertising,"It claims to sense Infrared images of people in front of the camera - it DOES NOT (I can check this with an infrared light source)it claims to have 6 infrared LEDS - NOPE it has 6 white LEDsIt claims to work with the macintosh with some driver you can download from vmicro - God alone knows what this driver I installed actually does, but it doesn't run a cameraIt is a total ripoff. At least if you are going to sell a hokey camera they could at least tell me what it actually does. The description must be cut and pasted out of something else.This identical camera is branded under many names (evidently you can just have a boat load shipped from china and stick on your own logo). My order said kinamax, i got something from a company called Sabrent.Bottom line: it is false advertisement and the item is nothing like the description except how it looks in the photo (off, without the white NON-infrared LEDs on)It stinks"
1,Not worth it,I have this item it dont even work on my laptop at all. I can't even use it on messengers that has webcam features in it. No matter how many times i try to get it working.. it shows a black image that is just about it.... the infrared don't even work even the program installation cd that came with it don't even work right at all.
4,"good webcam, good value","I bought a whole bunch of webcams a few months ago to find the best one to adopt for a product I am developing. This webcam was one of the better units. Furthermore, unlike most webcam sellers, this is an honest advertiser. This webcam DOES have a real 2-megapixel image sensor, as they claim. Every single one of the dozens of webcams that claimed 5, 8, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, 48 megapixels were actually 640x480 webcams (that's about 1/4 megapixel).This webcam had good image quality, focuses nice and close when you need to, is quite compact, has a slightly awkward but plausible stand, and is a good value. I did find one better value than this from cubeternet (also 2mp but has adjustable LEDs, a very long USB cable, good images, great color saturation, etc), but this unit is also a solid value."
1,Kernel Panic on my Macbook,"Well, I wish I could post a video review. But the camera keeps causing a kernel panic on my Macbook (running Leopard / Mac OS X 10.5), despite there being a Mac OS driver. Oh well."
2,You get what you pay for!,"Have reinstalled camera four times and the only thing that works is the microphone. No picture. There is no help reading the manual or on the mini-installation disk. What a waste of time and money. This is a perfect example of ""you get what you pay for""."
1,A poor knockoff?,"I bought an exactly identical looking camera from a store, and loved it - nice crisp image, good camera speed.Based on that I bought three of these on Amazon - WHAT A HUGE MISTAKE!WAY different image quality - looks like a .3 megapixel image from 5 years agoBad color (very yellow-ish) hueI knew something was up when I plugged one of the three cameras into the same pc and usb port of the one I liked, and it needed different drivers!So sad - I loved the first camera, but this is an identical-looking knockoff that is a total piece of junk.DO NOT BUY!"
3,Webcam,"its a decent webcam for the money. i suggest spending a little more money and getting something better. if you play with the light in ur room, it works ok."
3,good picture... buttttttt,"well, i can't figure out how to get the picture to NOT be purplei have black hair, and it seems to be lilac on the computer.Also, i can not figure out how to get the microphone to work.or the lights on the front of the cameraother than those things.its great."
1,This Cam IS NOT Infrared!!!,"I bought one of these from Tech Geek.This cam does not have infrared capabilities.The 6 LEDs are actually blindingly bright white lights.When I finally got a response from Kinamax, they say thet the cam will work in the dark.Well, so will my other one if I hook a flashlight to it.Ok cam for the money, but working in the dark and infrared are two different things.Drivers can be found at kinamax dot com"
5,Simple Plug-N-Play Does Its Job,"If all you're looking for is a simple webcam that's just gonna work when you plug it in then here it is. I have a Fujitsu tablet which has 2 microphones but no built in webcam. I ordered this one since it claimed to be plug n play and easy to use and you know what? It is! I currently dual boot Ubuntu and Windows XP and I'm glad to say that this camera works perfectly fine with both operating systems.Just be aware that this camera has no built in microphone of its own. However, it does come with an ear piece that has a microphone attached to it so that's a plus for those who need one or want to talk a little more privately."
3,Not quite as I expected,"The product is just fine, not quite as I expected. The manual, CD etc were useless. BUT the products serves my basic purpose and it's value for it's price."
4,Good for Ubuntu!,"It's true! Works out of the box for Ubuntu... and Windows XP. After spending waaaay too much time trying to make a couple of old webcams work on Ubuntu, I decided that it was time to move on. I picked up this webcam, and as the box advertises, it works straight out of the box on Linux. No hassles, no tears, no frustration. It just worked perfectly and made a perfect addition to Skype! I just wish it had a microphone!"
3,Works well but not as advertized,The one I received was not the IR one. It was the one with white LEDS. I had to mod it for IR.
4,OK for the price,"The picture is very grainy (you can focus it a bit, but it is always grainy.)Works well with the Raspberry Pi except I can't get the audio to work at this time."
3,Good camera,"Good camera for what i need it for. I have it set up in a cat house to watch over a few kittens. Clear display at night due to the IR. Display is probably more clear at night then day. IR works well for a distance of up to 4-5 feet. The focus lens was broken off when I got it so I had to focus it and glue together so it stays put. A little flimsy design but overall does what it needs.PSI got a second one from a different seller and even though they look the same and model numbers are the same, it came in different packaging and the IR does not work as well (maybe only 2feet distance)UPDATE:1 of the 2 (the second I ordered), the infrared stopped working. Nigh vision no longer works. Contacted Amazon and am getting a replacement."
2,"UVC & Mac Compliant, But then it CROAKED on me","This cam worked GREAT on my Mac for about 2 weeks... No drivers needed in Mac OSX 10.4.9 or 10.5, just plug-n-play -- but then video would cut-out if I moved or adjusted or even touched it - so I threw it in the garbage. Microphone NEVER did work on 2 Mac's I tested with. It's a shame, the image quality was impressive and low-light sensitivity was good while it lasted - but its' just a piece of cheap overseas junk (as other's confirm in their reviews)"
3,KINAMAX Infrared NightVision / 6 LED / USB 2.0 / 1...,Nice quality inexpensive webcam with IR capabilities.
1,Installation CD was broken and NOBODY provides customer service,"The installation CD was broken which prevents the installation of the camera onto the computer. I've tried contacting Kinamax, Computer Geeks, and Amazon about this problem and NONE responded to my e-mails. I guess this camera will just be sitting around collecting dust. This is complete BS! I bought it to use and nobody is willing to help me!"
3,"No built in Mic, otherwise normal.","Unless you're filming feature length films on this, no one really needs amazing picture quality or fancy features. This does the trick, comes with a little ear piece that has a mic on the cord, but I'd much preferred to have to mic built in to the camera."
2,"VGA camera average, worthless mic","The camera is so,so average for the price you pay. It is not 1.3 megapixel. It is 640 X 480 at best setting. The microphone is useless."
1,piece of junk,Wouldnt work with windows 7 or vista... I couldnt get the video AND the sound to work at the same time.
1,Not for little children,"The fact that this is a board book -- typical of baby books-- may inspire purchase of this book for very small children. Also it is advertised as a child's first introduction to the story of Exodus. However, as a parent, I wouldn't recommend reading this book to small children (under age 5 for example).This book focuses too heavily on the plagues-- with somewhat disturbing illustrations.Perhaps the book is good for older children in depicting the suffering of the Hebrew people as well as the Egyptians who also suffered for the Pharoah's obstinance."
4,Hot But A Little Different,"Well, first off, dont expect anything like X's last albums. This one isn't that dark. Most of the tracks are ""dance"" tracks. There are a few dark songs but not like his last albums. while i dont think this album is as good as his others i still give it a 4/5"
3,The Start Of The Grand Ending,"Back in '98 DMX was my favorite rapper. I really enjoyed ""It's Dark..."" and ""Flesh Of My Flesh..."". In 2000, when DMX returned with ""...And Then There Was X"", the love was still there, but not as strong as before. I was eagerly waiting for ""The Comeback"", but it never came. ""The Great Depression"" was a step backwards, and now ""The Grand Champ"" (as the title can tell) is just a stupid self glorification with very violent lyrics... I don't like it!!! The old DMX returns when listening to tracks, such as ""Untouchable"" and ""A'Yo Kato"". Besides, the european version includes the hit ""X Gon Give It To Ya"" from ""Cradle To The Grave OST"". Probably the best track on the cd. I heard that this might be DMX's last cd. Sad but true! Peace out!"
4,X STILL HAS IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This album is good. I didn't even have to buy or burn the album to listen to the tracks. I listened to it on MTV.com. X still has his roughneck in his blood. Like all his albums, this one is serious. I will give the tracks and my rating for them.1. Dog Intro- 3/52. My Life- 3/53. Where Da Hood At- 5/54. Dog's Out- 4/55. Get It On The Floor (ft. Swiss Beats)- 4/56. Come Prepared- 3/57. Shot Down (ft. 50 Cent & G-Unit)- 5/58. Bring The Noise- 3/59. Untouchable- 4/510. F*** Y'all - 4/511. Ruff Radio (skit)- 1/512. We're Back (ft. Eve & Jadakiss)- 5/513. Rob All Night(If Im Gonna Rob)- 4/514. We Go Hard - 4/515. We Bout To Blow- 3/516. The Rain- 2/517. Gotta Go (skit)- 1/518. Don't Gotta go home- 4/519. Ayo Kato- 4/520. Thank You- 3/521. Prayer V- 1/5Anyone who likes any of X's albums from the past will like this one. The champ is back and taking the game to the next level once again."
4,tight album,i did enjoy most of this album. but you really have to be a DMX fan to enjoy any of it. becasue if you don't then you wont realize that he really expresses himslef in every album. he tells his feelings and most rappers are afraid to do that. i did like this album.
5,"5 #1 ALBUMS!!! DONT LISSN 2 DA HATAZ!!! WHERE ""RULED OUT""?","Yall wonder where ""Ruled Out"" is right? Well X gave da beat 2 G-Unit!!! Now thats ""Gangsta Shhh"" Taak bout a favor 4 a favor! Waach out on Nov 4th 4 ""Beg 4 Mercy""! DOUBLE R/G-UNIT"
3,"NOT HIS HOTTEST, BUT WORTH THE MONEY","I been wit' X since day one, rockin his stuff from album to album, and its true that his flows is loosing it. He aint really talking about much and it seemed that he relied on his guest appearances more so than on his creativity. I mean he got some hot cats on there straight spitten, and the beats aint bad at all, he just and hold down no song that he got somebody and and he pretty much got somebody on every track. Truthfully, probably his hardest verse is on his song with Monica, and thats about cheating on his wife. He has her, 50, Styles, JADA, Sheek, Drag-ON, Eve, Cam'ron, Syleena Johnson, Swiss, Patti Labelle, and some other cats on there, but he aint nowhere near the hardest on there. The album in itself is HOT, you cant deny that, its able to be bumped from beginning to end, except for ""F--- Ya'll"" and a couple other bull songs, but if you are expecting something from X, like i was, then you WILL be disappointedBest Song-Shot DownWORST VERSE-Untouchable"
1,WHACK mainstream,"yall need to start listening to some real hip hop. DMX and other mainstream artists are too whack, rymin about their cash and bling. The videos are all about monotnous material. The real music is underground like aesop rock, cannibal ox, mr. lif, swollen members, son doobie, non phixion, and the list goes on. check them out and tell me what you think...what"
1,One star is too many,"Yo yo yo, yall. Rap sucks. Got that? Nothing, not a single redeeming factor in it. As far as something that sucks goes, DMX is beyond suck. The fact that this (c)rap sold more than 4 copies exemplifies the sorry state of the world. Huh? Ain't hip to my word? Get a dictionary, not addiction-ary. DMX is like fly excrement on a dog turd. It don't get no worse. I'd rather listen to a flatulent buffalo expel his stenching toots, which is more pleasant to my ear. And the aroma would not be half as gut-wrenching as DMX. Please, please, get some taste."
1,the dark man izz still on crack...,"...daaaamn.....timez get hard 4 X.""dark & hell is hot"" was a real good album, lyrically and sounding pretty tight.But the x man is not that worth of buying anymo. His tracks have nothing 2 do wit real hiphop, his verses sound like they were written from my lil cousin, & hiz shoutz don t work nomo.if u are feelin real good hiphop like (pac, three six mafia, scarface, Tela, Dayton Family, Manson FAmily, DPG, Do or Die, Pastor Troy) u shouldn t even touch thiz album.If u are more attracted to Puffy, Mase, Jay-Z, Nas & the other whacknezz, BUY it and be happy with the overrated rapgame."
4,Dmx is back,"Grand champ is the third best from dmx,to me. I have all his cd, Nothing can top his first album. so go get the cd like i did, you like it.My favorite track are:3.Where the hood at-great beat-great lyrics4.Dogs out-Good beat-pretty good track5.Get it on the floor-The best beat on the album-My favorite track7.Shot down- 50 cent and styles did good on this track-great flow by Dmx12.We're back- Pretty good track,great beat15.We go hard-The beat is crazy-love this track19.Don't gotta go home feat monica-They both did good on this song-good beat20.Ayo kato- good beat- don't listen to it that much,but like the song.Every thing else is ok, Dont really listen to the track I did'nt put down lets I'm playing a Video game."
2,The Neutered Dog,"The new album from the dog is... weak. Needless to say, DMX's first album was his best and any true fan of ""It's Dark and Hell is Hot"" will be disappointed with ""Grand Champ."" It would be safe to say that this is another ""Great Depression."" Don't get me wrong, there are a few hard songs like ""Shot Down"" featuring 50 cent and SP. Songs like ""Where the Hood at,"" ruin the album because it is just another commercialized club banger like ""Party Up."" As an avid listener of DMX, I feel that the album was thrown together quickly, almost as if he were in a hurry to finish his last album. ""Grand Champ"" is also predictable with his always included prayers and soft, preachy songs. I'm not sure this album deserved the name ""The Grand Champ,"" rather ""The Neutered Dog"" would be more appropriate."
4,DMX Returns,Justin Timberlake......The day I hear him on a hard core rap album is the day I'll stop listening to rap. To understand DMX you have to understand the progression of Hip Hop to Run Dmc to LL. So if your going to write a review....take rap 101 first.
5,I Love This CD,"DMX is consistent with putting out some of the hottest tracks ever. I respect a man who can make a rap song about God and still make it work. It seems a little weird after listening to the 20 tracks before it, but when you consider the fact that he is still trying to maintain, you understand that he may be trying to reach an audience that would never have listened to what he had to say in another format. DMX - keep doing your thing!"
3,Not Quite,"Being a huge DMX head, I had still pre-ordered the latest banger from the dog with low expectations after 'Great Depression!' which was well below X's previous high standards.I have to say that the first rotation impressed me a lot, but on subsequent listens I have become less an less so. Sure the album is scattered with good tracks, and even some excellent ones (Where The Hood At, Dog Intro, 'Bout To Blow), but it's not enough. All those people out there saying this is better than 'It's Dark...' need to take another listen.'It's Dark....'is one of the best albums of my generation and a classic - Unfortunately Grand Champ goes a long way to putting the Dog back on top, but it does not come close to his Debut.He's shouting a lot more, but saying a lot less."
3,What you think it is.,"The disc contains a lot of stuff that sounds a lot like all his other records. If you like his other records, you will like this. It is nothing special, really...........I like the dog on the front."
4,I Dizagree Witcha'll,"A'yo most y'all catz iz hatin on this album!!! This iz how i C it, DMX had great albumz in da past, in my opinion, ""...And Then There Was X"" was his best 1!!!! But he haz evolved since then. From a Pup 2 A Full Grown Dog!!! This album iz HOTT!!! There are many tight songz on this album such az, ""The Rain"", ""Get it On The Floor"", ""Where Da Hood At"", and Da hook from ""A'yo Kato"" iz jus off da damn chain!!! If this iz DMX last album, ""I'ma miss u cuz!"" If it ain't ""Keep doin' ya thang Dogg!"" But regardless, DMX iz and alwayz will be 1 of da best rapperz, in my opinion!! and Bring it if U want it!!!!"
2,DMX needs improvement,"The DMX album ""Grand Champ"" is nothing to write home about. The beats in all the tracks are almost the same. The only tracks that are really good are ""Where the Hood AT"", ""Dogs Out"", ""Shot Down"", & ""Don't Gotta Go Home"". His previous album ""The Great Depression"" is far better than his current album.DMX please improve."
4,The dog is out,X will never do better or even match his first album so yall need to get over it. I think this is better than his last one and maybe his 3rd best out of all 5.Hot tracks:Shot downget it on the floorDogs outWhere the hood atAyo KatoWe go hard
1,all dogs lose there bite,"This album was the most wack attempt at regaining his status. Dmx has been going down hill since ""flesh of my flesh blood of my blood"" this album his full of gun busting killing and nothing new from the ""grand champ"". i think its about time he hangs up his collar. if your not familiar with X's music go out and cop ""It's dark and hell is hot"" & ""flesh of my flesh blood of my blood"" you will be pleased. sorry Dark man X. this album sucked"
5,DMX is at his peak,"Dmx has done it. He dominated on this album, every song is a hit. Also he has hit artists on there like 50 cent etc. This is by far his greatest cd's. Go out and buy it."
1,Therapy Should Remain Private,"Eustace Froote (a.k.a. DMX) has indeed suffered horribly at the hands of his trusted mentor Michael ""Tickle Me"" Jackson, and for this we are all profoundly sorry. But that is no excuse for inflicting on his loyal fans this truly horrifying project, which was obviously originally designed as private therapy for gratifying and hopefully dispelling his rather intense Oedipal fixations. We did not need to hear about all the squalid demons festering inside Eustace's severely damaged psyche. These embarrassing revelations should never have left his therapist's office."
4,All the haters,"All you haters done hating? Apparently not. It seems to me you done hating on someone else and never stop with that. All you haters need to get a life please, and stop hating on people because that's all your doing, and I can easily see that by the number of cr3p reveiws on this site. While this is a good CD it's not as bad as people say it is and most reviews are exaggerated such as saying why he has no freinnds and why he i likes buggs or whatever nothing but BS iswhat that is. Who cares??! Good CD, funny ass skits. Decent for the money. And better than the cr@p you can buy today."
2,WHAT????,"Darkman X. Please stop putting your sh*t out there. I'm so very sorry but i really liked his first two albums. Nowadays all i hear is the same ol sh*t. Is there anybody outthere who can tell me what is the use of all those stupid skits. STOP PUTTING SKITS ON RECORDS. Sh*t man even dr. Dre is more renewing then Russel Simmons and that guy is what 50 years old. I'm trying to give al these rappers a wake up call. I've got a question for al rappers out there. Why is it so hard to make an album whit 20 great songs on it? Stop wasting my time whit f*cked up albums whit only 3 great songs on it. If i'm gonna spend money make it worth my wild. All ya rappers know who i'm talking bout. Dmx,Snoop,Drag-on,Slim,Game,50,Dre MAKE GREAT LP's not just 1 great song every once in a while. And last but defenitly not least JA-Fool and Nelly. Both of you please stop what your doing. NOBODY LIKES IT"
1,Talk about your all time album bust,"First off I would like to get the point across that I am as big a DMX fan as you will come across. That being said, this album is the biggest disappointment I have ever had. Of the 23 tracks on this cd there are only 4 truly good hip hop tracks (Shot Down, The Rain, Ayo Kato, The Dog Intro). The rest of this album is filled with a lack of strong lyrics that is compensated by, and I thought I would never say this, to much emotion. All the barking, growling, and yelling was cool when X was bringing it in the lyric and flow department. Now it is just plain annoying. I never thought I would see DMX put so much commercial filler music on his album. Grand Champ! More like back to the drawing board X. Don't buy this album without listening to it first."
1,dmx sux and u do 2 if u like this album,ohh my where do i start. this is the worst album i have ever heard. Dmx's its dark and hell is hot is one of the best albums of all time and ill never take that away from him but he has definately fell off. the lyrics and choruses are the worst i have ever heard and the beats suck too. if u like this album you are truly an idiot and u prolly have this album stashed away with lil jon and the eastside boyz. dmx is the farthest thing from the grand champ i mean come on we all know eminem is the grand champ.
2,DarkManX or boring DarkMouseX,"This CD is no were near the standard he set with ""Then There Was X"" The production is lazy the lyrics are wack. I Thought DMX would have gone all out with this one, his last album and all, but he hasn't. Stick to his older stuff it's much better."
3,ALBUM IS OK WITH ME.,"A'YO KATO! JUST LISTEN TO THAT TRACK... TELL ME HOW MANY FAKE FRIENDS ARE IN THIS WORLD?WHAT A SONG...SO MANY FAKES! TOO LITTLE FRIENDS YOU CAN TRUST.DOGS,CATS,EVEN NASTY ASS BUGS CAN BE YOUR TRUST WORTHY FRIENDS."
3,Somethingz Wrong in his head.,"DMX is not relegous as much as he says he is, if he keep making raw records like this.He said suck my d@ck like on all his records.I think he wants his D@ck sucked or something?The only songsthat was appealing to me was ""Get it On the Floor"" and ""Were Back"".And Get it on the floor wasn't really a sucesswith radio play or the Music video on T.V. I only seen the video twice on mtv2 after that there were no more singles that was itfor grand champ....Sadd. I don't even like the upcoming singlesfor Here we Go Again!,What Shame. DMX Needs to get his life together fast before he self destructs."
2,3 good tracks,"THIS ALBUM IS AWFUL, DMX ONLY HAS 3 GOOD SONGS AND 5 DECENT HOOKS ON THIS LONG ALBUM,THE WORK SEEMS RUSHED AND I DONT THINK THAT THE PRODUCER DESERVES MUCH PRAISE EITHER!!!"
2,where da hell is X?,"mad props to all y'all rap lovaz out there..i heard his new track few days ago, and i gotta admit.. he's losin' it. his beats ain't what it used to be, and plus he's rhymes are losing attention. i remember how he used to bark and rhyme like a rap god.. now, he's just another one of those billion pop singer out there..."
3,DMX has had better,"Well, this is his potentially last recording. To me, I believe it was due. His 1st cd was the greatest (Its Dark and Hell is Hot). After that, the beats became to get the feel he was just bringing them out cuz he needed the money. His new cd has a few good tunes that are similar to that of his 1st cd. But most of the songs are all jingles with annoying people singin the chorus. DMX has good potential, but even though Im a fan of DMX, I beleive he could have done a lot better for what was supposed to be his last CD."
4,Going out with a bang..,"As DMX's final CD, Grand Champ offers a lot that DMX fans will enjoy. Cameos from notables such as 50 Cent and Jadakiss mark certain songs, and a couple of typical Ja Rule disses can be found spread along the CD.'Where the Hood At?' is, of course, music video material, and will probably join the leagues of 'Who We Be' and other previous DMX hits. 'A'Yo Kato', a tribute to DMX's deceased friend, displays a good deal of sentiment from the Dark Man X. Other notable tracks include 'Dogs Out' and 'Shot Down'.'Grand Champ' certainly doesn't surpass the level of 'It's Dark & Hell Is Hot', but nevertheless, it's an exceptional CD. I would advise putting the money into it, particularly if you are a DMX fan."
2,downhill trend,"it just keeps getting worse and worse for x. the first album was real. the second was decent, the third was pathetic. the fourth one, someone gave to me because it was so horrible this one has 3 or 4 good songs, which is why i gave it a 2. i have faith he can put out a good cd again, which i assume is why i keep buying his cds"
2,X sucks,"All I got to say is DMX sucks!!. Grand Champ is a grand failure. You could tell when Great Depression came out two years ago that X was on the decline. But now with his newest record, Grand champ, DMX has hit the bottom in his career. If he would of called it quits with the Great Depression he would have at least been able to leave the rap game with his head held high. If you still want to hear DMX, go cop Then There Was X, his last hot CD."
2,not as good as his other cds,this is probly his worst out of every cd hes made. i almost fell asleep on some of the songs. were back and shot down are good. the rest suck. dont but this album.
2,Crap,This is so POPPY... i dont know i guess its cuz of the people that it features... dmx lost it after flesh of my flesh... but hey hes still one of the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,this is not good music,"No disrespect to X, but his stuff is gettin old. all he does is yell in the mic real loud and bark like a dog, but his hardcore lyrics are gettin kinda desperate . . . and he doesnt even have the best verse on the album (that goes to 50 Cent on Shot Down). If u're looking for a good DMX album, dont look here."
2,DMX-15 Minutes R Up,"first off i lyke dmx but his tyme n tha rap game is overdue.ive been sayin tha same thyng since flesh of my flesh album,all thys cat does iz make barking noises and other sound effects(exp. WHAT!!!WHAT!!!).he is another tupac wannabe and on all hiz albums he haz tha same subject matter which is kill everybody on just about all tha tracks and at tha beginning and end he wants 2 pray.dmx has fallen off period and thys weak album is adding dirt 2 hiz grave.dont waste your money on this garbage,its not even worth downloading,save your computer space."
4,its pretty good,"well i am a big dmx fan and from his first album on he has kinda slipped on each album but to be honest it is a pretty good cd worth buying but don't buy this cd and expect you going to get the same dmx that put out the album ITS DARK AND HELL IS HOT, but buy this album and listen to it it worth it........"
2,THE ROADS OF TEXAS,"WE PLAN ALL OF OUR MOTORCYCLE ROAD TRIPS USING THIS BOOK. IT SHOWS ALL OF THE BACK ROADS, WHICH IS A MOTOR CYCLE DREAM. THANK FOR ALL OF THE GOOD TIMES. E.R."
2,useless in towns and cities,"The maps are really nicely laid out, but, unless you travel the back roads, it's pretty useless. The maps of towns and cities are totally unusable. Get the Delorme one and accept that you'll have to replace it every few years."
4,Great for Texas motorcyclists!,"This book has all the roads you could be looking for to ride those twisty-turnies! However, the print on this edition is EXTREMELY small! There is a newer edition out, published in 2005. It has updated maps, and the print is MUCH better."
5,A TX Map Must-have,"Well, you can get the TX Atlas and Gazetteer and be safe enough but compliment it with this and you have all your bases covered. I used to stormchase a longgg time ago and the Roads Of books were highly recommended. Ever since then, I've always purchased one for the state I reside in.You really cannot find a better map reference for the state. Even the smallest of roads is mentioned. Texas is a darn big place - it's unwise to go toolin' around there without a good reference. This is one that you shouldn't go without."
2,"Sure it's got the roads, but not the names.","Well, this book is full of roads. But when they aren't identified, this book is practically useless. How do you give directions as ""three lines south, then four lines west""? I'm returning it and looking for another one."
1,LOUSY MASTERING @ LESS THAN 5MB/SECOND,"I HAVE SEEN THESE MOVIES IN THIS ""RESTORED"" BOX SET. THE IMAGE QUALITY IS HORRID, HORRIBLE, AND REALLY STINKS. MY FRIEND HAS EQUIPMENT TO MEASURE THE BIT RATE...IT WAS REALLY LOW.FOR THE BIG BUCKS THIS SELLS AT, COULDN'T SONY HAVE MASTERED AT A HIGHER BIT RATE AND SPREAD THE MOVIE OVER THE REAL ESTATE OF TWO LAYERS?FOR THE COMPANY THAT DID ""SUPER-BIT"" MASTERING SEVERAL YEARS AGO, SONY HAS DONE A 180 IN QUALITY.SHAME ON SONY!BQS"
2,Disappointing,"I bought this product as a Christmas present for a friend on the sole basis that it was made by Mayfair games, who makes some excellent games that my friends and I love to play (Settlers of Cataan, Family Business). After the others, this one was a disappointment. The game is much like clue, but without a board, and with many more suspects and options to try to eliminate. Some may like this, but between my friends and I we came to a consensus that the act of eliminating categories simply became too unwieldy."
2,Not sure its a good choice,"I bought this game for Christmas for my mom, who loves mysteries. But the directions are a little lacking and none of us could figure out how the question/answer part of the game is really suppose to help. Its very in-depth which was nice and put a little more challenge to the game, but it wasn't one of my favorites."
1,Was not all that fun...,"It is similar to clue but from the reviews I read on Amazon, it was kind of misleading. There were way too many cards. I guess it would be more fun with a ton of people but if you have 3 or 4, each person holds a deck of cards to look through. Not that fun."
4,Very beautiful book!,"I am a great admirer of Catherine Stock's work. These angels are just wonderful and can make even the most ""art-challenged"" adult look good. It does take some serious investment of time to color and cut out all 12 angels, but you'll like the results. A little too advanced for my 3 year old, but I can see us decorating the angels together in a few years. Overall, well worth the price and effort."
5,Great Toy,Our son loves this toy. It is especially useful to help build balance for your toddler as they can learn to sit up by holding on to the toy and playing with it. It is also not to big and cumbersome so my 9 month old can actually drag it with him wherever he goes.
2,BIG - and not much to it.,"It has great bold colors, but that's about it. It is quite large - I think my baby would like it better if it were smaller and lighter where she could hold it and shake it. My 3 year old picked it up and it didn't last long with him either."
3,Drug-use made banal,"Fans of Burroughs' frantic stream-of-conciousness writing style may be put off by this autobiographical text, which is essentially a lurid dime novel. Burroughs shows us, over and over again, the pros and cons of heroin addiction; we get an idea of what the daily life of a drug addict is, and it's dull. Cutting edge when it was first released, the prose's dated slang gets in the way of the reader taking seriously Burroughs' message. However, those that aren't fans of his more abstract (and more pornographic) works may find this novel more accessible"
4,A great captivating first hand account of drug addiction,"This book gives a very graphic portrayal of the Junky's life,told from first hand knowledge. It starts with the use of 'M' (Morphine)rapidly being replaced with the new drug of choice for Burroughs, 'H' (Heroin)It gives a very realistic and harrowing description of the Junk Sickness,felt by all Junkies trying to break the habit. This book also gives a great insight of the socalled Cure programs and how they fail to 'Cure' the craving for ""Junk"".A must read for any Burroughs fan, and any person such as I,that wantsto find out what exactly drives a human being to self destruction."
3,charming but is it a true reflection?,"I read this book several years ago and enjoyed the narrative style that Burroughs employed (a break from his cut up style).For a tale of drug addiction its quite a leisurely read, though at the mercy of heroin William Seeward manages to do a lot of travelling and in certain respects this book is almost like reading the journal of an explorer or frontier man. That in itself is good but I think a more accurate reflection of the junkies experience is probably Wayne Grogan's recent 'Junky Pigrim' - that is truly bleak stuff full of all the brutal realities of junk sickness - it makes this book seem like a Disney fantasy."
4,WOW!.....how amazing!,"I just finished reading this book and I have to say that it truly fascinated me! The reason why I only gave it four stars is because it does get boring here and there. But worry not because by the end of the book, when Mr. Lee gets to Mexico, it really picks up and the life style of a junky begins to take hold more stongly then the life of a common criminal! Read this book if you are into the whole 'beat generation' or anything that is unusual from the norms we set for ourselves withing this society. It may change some of they way you think!"
3,If you've read his other stuff expect disappointment,"First books are usually not kind to nostalgics. Case in point, Burroughs doesn't do anything in this book but shoot up. After awhile it all gets tedious. Thankfully it is short. Interesting if you like Burroughs but not particularly new in any way"
3,An easier to follow version of the life of a heroin addict,"By far, this book is much easier to follow than Burroughs' book ""Naked Lunch"". ""Junky"" gives a better idea of what the day to day life of a heroin addict is like. One thought which stands out in my mind is Burroughs' explanation of heroin addiction. At first, you take junk for the high, than you take the junk to prevent the sickness that comes from withdrawal. The high is non-existant at this important, and becomes irrelevant. The adventures of Bill Lee take him from New York to Mexico in ""Junky"". Bill seems to be consistently trying to kick the habit. However, the logic to his quitting is flawed because he tries to replace one addiction with another. This is the source of his adventuresin ""Junky"". One problem I have with this book is its lack of an apparent plot. However, this may be intentional because the life of a junky also lacks apparent meaning."
4,An amazing account about the real life of a junky.,"William Burroughs is known for his ""cutting-up"" style of novel writing. After reading THE WILD BOYS and NAKED LUNCH, I didn't think Burroughs was anything but a drug induced wannabe writer. Fortunately, I gave the cult icon one more chance and found out there is something to his ability. In JUNKY, Burroughs tells about his life while living under the influence of heroin and other drugs. He takes us all over the world with him and reveals truths about drugs that others ignore. A must read."
3,"Good book, could have been better.","The basic message. Don't become a ""junky"". Don't develop a ""habit"". Fairly executed, but not perfectly executed. Defenitely an exciting read for any Burroughs fan though"
4,a highly addictive read,"In ""Naked Lunch,"" William S. Burroughs used hallucinations, sexuality, and nightmarish imagery to string along a 'plot' that was anything but traditional. While I found the book to be a gripping, thought-provoking read, I was downright surprised at the clear-headedness of ""Junky,"" which is essentially a window into the life of a heroin user, circa early 1950s. Burroughs (as Bill Lee) illustrates his descent into addiction, from his first fix up until his habit builds to staggering proportions; the descriptions of a junkie's daily routine, from shaking down drunks in train stations to eluding police, are done using precise dialogue that incorporates a considerable amount of slang (an informative glossary is included in the book). ""Junky"" is a hypnotically engrossing read, a book that sucks you into the world of addiction and leaves you clamoring for more."
4,The Junky and the pauper,"Junky was a very provocative text. It takes the reader back to 1940s and 50s erotica, that is almost cartoonish."
3,it was a good book,It came in the mail just fine. The content of the book itself was alright I thought it would be more dramatic than what it was.
3,Junk-Y,"Junky: The Definitive Text of Junk by William S. Burroughs ***To be honest I did not enjoy this very much. I am a massive Burroughs fan, he is easily one of my favorite authors of all time, and I have read nearly all his work, and enjoyed almost all of it. Junky is the exception to that. I at times felt the book to be, dare I say boring. Burroughs attempt at the occasional humor was dry and not witty like on most of his work. I found the plot, or lack there of really, to be bland and at times annoying. His style seems to even be strained here, which is sad considering he is one of the most original writers in American history, as well as one of the most underrated.Now even this, the definitive text didn't save the story for me. I am not saying this was totally bad, so please don't get me wrong. Junky has lots of potential, and could have been one of his best works, but for me personally this just seems weak for an author of his stature."
3,Not as good as the Hype,"""Junky"" is more of a curiosity than the 'classic' it is often billed as.It details William Burroughs drink drug and sex addictions;the highs and lows,and is responsible for every urban myth ever uttered about drug culture!The fact that Burroughs did everything detailed makes him,at best,a self indulgent hedonist,at worst,a complete imbecile.And his arguments against the admittedly OTT and reactionary laws rushed in against drug use being that they were like the anti-semitic German laws during the nazis shows how shallow Burroughs thinking and intellect really are.Burroughs doesn't come close to Nelson Algren in 'beat' culture writing,and I can only presume people are awed by his Ivy League upbringing to award him such status.Again;interesting as a curiosity,but don't fall for the 'classic'label.It's just a marketing ploy!"
4,A True Work of Great Creative/Realistic Literature,"I was sitting in crative writing class, and a boy in my class yelled out something about a book Called ""Junky"" By William S. Bourroughs. I an also an avid guitar player and my biggest inspiration was Tommy Bolin who died of a Heroin overdose. This book truly show how the addict thinks, feels, and acts all while they are pushing their own demise along. At first it seems as though the book glorifies drugs, and thugs. But upon reaching the end of the book, you'll be convinced to never venture near the needle. I highly reccomend this book to anyone who has evr comnptemplatd ever becoming a user of Heroin, Opium, or any of the substances in this book. Bottom Line: Hard, Realistic Description of a broken life, Bourroughs best work by far!"
5,Simply Shocking but extremely well written!,"This book is one of those books that shock you and stays with you for ever. It is such an effective book that we may feel compassionate and remorseful about the protagonist's actions. Borroughs' books are legendary and should be always used as a moral lesson for everyone. I advise to read ""Queer"" (by Borroughs). ""Queer"" is even more devastating and dramatic."
2,Flunky.,"I read Junky over the course of two days and I cant say it was a complete waste of time, but i'm no better for the experience. ""Junky"" is a narrow, flat, and ego-centric account of a creepy man and his pathetic heroin addiction. I did appreciate Burrough's moral ambiguity, but thats easy to achieve. If I wanted a to learn a slew of outdated heroine slang I would of ordered a chicken fried steak at Denny's. Whatever that means."
4,A Shocker for the Fifties:Middle-Class Whites Addicted to H!,"Burroughs must be Commended for Writing this book when he did - the Fifies! I grew up during this era, and back then we all assumed that everyone lived life like ""The Leave It to Beaver"" show. From the very first lines of this book Burroughs tells us he came from a wealthy midwestern home - and, horrors, became a heroin addict! The book reveals great details of what life was like: carefully rolling drunks in the subways for wallets with another junkie pal, going from kicking heroin to getting drunk day and night, and staying away from ""pigeons"", other addicts who would squeal to the cops. This was probably the first book to take off the wraps concerning the day-to-day life of heroin addicts. The style is dated, and at times it bogs down in its repetitiveness, but we should take our hats off to him for writing about exactly how life was for him. Sometimes even wealthy, white men on trust funds end up badly hooked."
2,Junky,"I thought the book was repetitious, boring and not very interesting. It presented a view of life that was not particularly fascinating. Perhaps it is educational for some."
4,Classic,"Kerouac, boringGinsberg, alrightBurroughs, amazing!William Burroughs is my favorite writer from the era and junkie is one of the reasons why."
4,biography of an extraordenary drug addict.....!,"this is an honest display of william s. burroughs 15years old heroin addiction,a vulger ,shocking biography of jentelman junky ,un controlable need to drugs took over bill lee's life which changed his conciosness forever...."
3,there are better books,"burroughs' book is immature and extremely outdated (and in fact predated). While his story gets interesting a number of times, there are several books that are grittier, truer, and more poignant to the matter of heroin addiction. This is just another pretentious piece of pulp about a topic already exhausted by many people before his time, and i would say even jim carroll's work (a predecessor indeed) is a step up from this."
2,Ho hum,"Further evidence that the self-indulgent spoiled children of the beat generation couldn't produce a book worth reading. At least the unreadable Naked Lunch could be hated, but Junky is too meagre to inspire any emotion at all, even negative ones."
2,What was this guy thinking!!!!,"i have read two books by burroughs (naked lunch is the other one) and i think that this one confirms my opinion about the author and his work. this guy writes like i did when i was in the fifth grade, i think that the book is missing a little bit of creativity although many people state the contrary."
2,"Another ""shoot 'em up"" book? Very disappointed.",Hello????HAs anybody seen THE DRUGSTORE COWBOY???Same thing different era.Read something else....use this to roll whatever you were smoking when you bought this book.
5,A Memory for Life,My daughter was actually pulled from the extras and was given a part in the movie. She is grown now and still aspires to be an actress. I wish there were more acting opportunities in Texas. Hope is a wonderful movie that all baby boomers can relate with. Kudos to Goldie and Maureen for being lovely people to work with. The experience was one we will cherrish forever. Going to the premier in New York was icing on the cake!This is a movie your whole family could benefit from watchingJudy Werlinger
2,"My ""Hope Review""","The movie itself was very good. The first 10 minutes of the video are messed up, so I do not know what happens during the first 10 minutes. I would not recomend buying a used video unless you get the chance to view it first to make sure it is ok."
2,Holes not sanded and very difficult to string,"I am very disappointed in the quality of these beads. While they are nicely painted and bright on the outside, the inside of the holes are not sanded so it is nearly impossible, even for adults, to get the string though. If you do manage to get the string threaded though the bead, it takes some force to pull it through the rough surface and tears up the string in the process. Maybe a thinner more leathery string would work better. I would have thought that with a ""quality"" name like Melissa and Doug they would at least test the product before they sell it!"
3,String catches on the inside of the beads.,"I called the manufacturer's 800 number regarding the fact that it is nearly impossible to get the string thru the hole in the bead. They are sending me a whole new set. After I called I realized that I could just switch out the laces with some that were thinner and less fuzzy. That worked pretty well and my daughter was happy.It is obvious the manufacturer did not test their product, other wise this would not have been a problem!"
4,Fun But Beads Stick,"My son who is 2 loves this toy. He has no problem with the concept of stringing the beads however, the holes on the beads are just rough enough to catch on the string. On the ovals, rectangles and even the squares they really have to push to get the string to pass through. The quality is excellent both visually and structurally. My son also likes to play ""blocks"" and stack the beads. I just wish they had sanded the inside of the holes better so the string didn't get caught."
5,fun learning and interacation,"My son just turned 2 and loves his Lacing Beads in a Box. We can count, review colors and shapes, build, and lace as well as unlace. He also loves trying to fit all of the pieces back into the durable carrying box. My only (small) concern of durability would be the string. Overall, we are well pleased."
2,disappointed,"I was disappointed with this product as it is very difficult to use. It is coloful, cute, and appealing, but when it comes to trying to string the blocks, I have a lot of trouble, and my 2 1/2 year old son cannot get the string to go through hardly at all. The problem is that the holes inside many of the blocks have not been well filed/sanded, and the string can't get through. If it does go through, it often catches and snags. Otherwise this would be a great toy."
4,my 3 year old godson had fun using these and his 5 year old brother uses them a lot too,my 3 year old godson had fun using these and his 5 year old brother uses them a lot too
5,Fun skills,"For what seems like a simple task and toy, my son spent hours and hours playing. Not only did he like to string the beads, he'd put the ""necklaces"" on me and his stuffed animals. Then he loved stacking the beads like blocks. We played shape matching and color sorting together with them as well. He's learned a lot and mastered the threading skills, but still plays with these often."
5,Lacing Beads in a Box,Another wonderful product from Melissa and Doug. My 20 month old stacks the blocks for hours. She's a bit young to string the beads...but I know that this is an activity she'll use for a long time.
2,Bad Beads!,"I read the reviews and thought I'd buy it for my two-year old. Well, a week after I bought them, one of the wooden beads cracked so it's useless. The worst problem was trying to thread the lace through. It kept getting caught inside the bead because the company didn't sand the inside of the beads well enough. The lace kept catching on the wood. What a waste of money!"
1,The string gets stuck!,These beads are very difficult for my daughter to string together because the string gets caught on the inside of the beads. The beads should be sanded down inside so the string cen be put through smoothly.
3,Great for learning play but beads get caught,"I was tickled to find a bead kit wit large enough beads for my 27 month old. He loves naming the colors and counting them. However, the insides of the beads are not sanded enough and get caught before you can even lace it through. I wrapped duct tape around the first inch and a half of string to he can at least get the bead on. I'll probably find a way to sand them down since it would be a bigger hassle to repackage it and send it back. I'll try a smaller, less fuzzy string first."
3,can't get strings through the beads!,"Sure this would be great for motor skills and hand/eye coordination, except that my 2 year old gives up in two seconds since the nylon string will not go through most of the beads! The beads are rough and splintery inside, which snags the nylon string so it won't go through. Very poor design in my opinion, I mean, isn't that the whole point of these things?"
3,Financial cynics,"After hearing Greenspan testify before Congress after the election of GW Bush, I was convinced that he was senile. After watching this interview, I was convinced that he was one of the most callous, cold-hearted, millionaires I have ever heard. His arguments for globalization are more than a little cynical, and show how little concern he really has for anyone who is not in his rather privileged echelon. The picture on the jacket ways a lot about this man."
3,Nothing spectacular here,"Good as far as Junior League cookbooks go, but I cannot say there are any hidden gems of recipes here. I will cook about 3 recipes that I have targeted. Other than that, I could not find anything that would make me suggest this book to anyone. The older cookbooks seem to always call for ""jalapeno cheese log""....gosh that item has been off the shelves for years....just one of the things you have to cope with when ordering these types of books."
4,"Contents fine, book condition terrible","The book itself is a fine collection, however, this book should never have been shipped. The plastic binding was all but broke. Instead of going to the hassle of returning it, I took it to Kinko's and had the plastic binding replaced. Probably cheaper than sending it back via the Postal Service."
5,A treasure!,"Someone gave us this book as a gift about 10 years ago and we use it for every holiday as it reminds us of our southern roots and holidays at my grandmother's. If you are a southern cook or love southern cooking, you can't go wrong with this one. I am living out of the country for a year and this is the one cookbook I want to have with me. The desserts are especially scrumptious!"
5,A real reference for Cajun and Southern cooking,"I collect cookbooks. Many of them sit on the shelf, and are used very rarely. However, this cookbook is in a very small minority of books that get used over and over again. I just bought my second copy, as the sprial binding finally gave out on my first copy. The only other cookbooks that I use as often as this one are Joy of Cooking and Fannie Farmer."
4,Nice third floor,"We bought this third floor space for our daughter's windmill playset. It fits well and is quite sturdy. The whole product is pretty durable. Furniture that comes with it is tiny, but that is how all the Calico Critters pieces seem to be. I will say the sponge, soap and soap holder are smaller than an eraser on a pencil. Tiny, tiny, tiny!!! Really don't know how these kids play with these things and not have them lost and sucked up in a vacuum; but as far as my daughter feels, she loves it."
1,mudrat,"What kind of fooooool would spend almost $50.00 for ANY cd!111How many fooools are there out there, you must be out there to spend $50.00 for a cd"
1,worse design of a bottle ever,I am so upset with this spray. I had to shut the water off and reattach the peice that connects the hose to the bottle about 10 different times. A couple times the top peice that covers the water sprayer popped off. The last time that the connector peice popped off the cover peice popped off as well and it came flying back into me and the top of the sprayer cut my hand. I have never been so disappointed and upset by a product in my hole life.
1,Unbeleivably BAD !!!!!! Sprayer SUCKS !!!!!!,"Can't believe I bought it and a refill bottle. Same story..... hose popped off till I gave up. NEVER AGAIN !!!! Can't find a complaint email address and I'm sure not gonna call a phone # to Lord knows where or send a letter. As others..... label SOAKED along with ME.NEVER...NEVER !!!!!!! Don't BUY IT, You'll regret it."
1,Doesn't Work,"I purchased four bottles of this stuff. I'm angry, to say the least. The nozzle just doesn't work. It sprays water but not insect killer. Then it comes off. I finally transferred the product to an Ortho Max container. Time will tell if the bug killer itself kills any bugs. I would not waist my time with this product again."
1,Will never buy again,"As another reviewer noted, the spraying mechanism is absolutely worthless. It took me well over an hour to spray most of my tiny yard. (I say most because I just gave up.) The hose attachment popped off no less than 12 times. It cannot be reconnected while water is flowing, so be prepared to walk back to the faucet over and over and over again. The sharp plastic drew blood from my wet, poison covered hands at least twice while I struggled to pop it back on. The adjustment mechanism and spray shield both broke midway through use. After becoming frustrated, I once forgot to fully close the flow valve while walking back to the faucet - queue a face-full of insecticide. Since the warning labels were soaking wet, I couldn't even read how dangerous the chemicals were. I decided to take a ""cold shower"" in the yard to dilute what was on my skin. After all, there wasn't much dry clothing left on my anyways."
5,What a difference one can make,"Had a little time this morning to read ""To Give Is To Live."" I finished Chapter 1 and can't wait to continue. I am so taken by Doc Houk's account of his feelings and belief I momentarily thought I was in the middle of a ""can't put down best-selling novel."" I am only 46 but I definitely share the views of Doc Houk and it is scintillating to have confirmation of those feelings from ""The Master."" Yes, ""To Give Is To Live""..........a life that few have the luxury of experiencing yet it is all in one's power to do so. I have always known that ""to give"" is a selfish act - for the joy of giving and making a difference far outweighs anything I could ever possibly receive."
3,Not as good as Eyewitness,"Although this guide book did have useful information and was small and easy to carry, I thought our Eyewitness Venice travel guide was much better. The Lonely Planet descriptions seemed to tell me about everything that was going badly in Venice and focused very little on the beautiful and positive side of the city. I would recommend checking out the Eyewitness book instead."
3,Too many cans ...,"I bought this book because I went back to work and wanted to use our crockpot more often, but should have looked around some more. While this book didn't seem to have as many recipes that required a lot of preparation - sometimes the prep work negates the benefit of using the darned thing in the first place - it also relies too much on canned products, in my opinion. If all I need to do is open a can, I could just buy some Chunky Soup and skip the whole cooking process.I was hoping for something a little more healthy and can probably make some of these recipes work with minor adjustments - and it might be great for beginning cooks. It just wasn't worth $10.20 for me and I wish I hadn't spent the money."
5,Favorite Christmas CD,"I have many Christmas cd's, but this older cd remains my favorite for a great selection of classical and traditional favorites, especially the Franz Biebl version of the ""Ave Maria"". Let's hope that it becomes more available on the marketplace."
3,Wrong track listings,"This is not the original soundtrack but another compilation of Francis Lai tracks. Please, correct this.The right track listing is:Bilitis, Theme from Love Story, The Blue Rose (La Rose Bleue), Emotion, Happy New Year, Love in the Rain, Seduction, Intimate Moments, Par le Sang des Autres,A Man and a Woman, Live for Live, African Summer, Sur Notre Etoile, La Ronde, Les Unes et Les Autres, Smic Smac Smoc, Solitude and Whitechapel.But at this price, you can't go wrong if you are starting your Francis Lai collection or if you just love great music. Taking also into account that few of his recordings are available on CD."
4,Love Story (IMPORT) (SOUNDTRACK),THIS CD IS VERY NICE. BUT I DIDN'T RECIVE THE CD. LOVE STORY (1970 FILM)(IMPORTED)(SOUNDTRACK) BY THE SAME AUTOR.THANK YOU I APPRECIATE YOUR COMPRENSSION.SINCERELY.ROBERTO G. GONZALEZ
2,Wasn't as happy as wished,"All and all I like Al Hirt ""At the Mardi Gras"" better. This is suited more for someone that needs to hear Al and Pete Fountain together."
2,Poor design,"Poor design:1) The 1/2"" pipe clamp has very thin and weak springs pushing the clutch plates; without the pipe, plates/spring would easily fall out.2) The idea of eliminating the need for threaded pipe is nice but poorly executed; the clutch plates do not hold the pipe firmly thus allowing the clamp's upper part to spin as you rotate the handle3) The plastic clampshell cover is very flimsy which broke during shipment allowing the clutch plates & springs from all 4 of my clamps to fall out!"
3,Poor performance,2 years ago I bought 4 of it. After few uses one of them got broken (the knot that holds the handle). The reason I give it 3 stars is the easy versatile use. I cut 1/2 inch pipes in different lengths (but be careful not to exceed 60 inches or else the pipe will bent). It is useful in small projects which is my type.
4,Good clamp for the money,"I recently purchased 10 of these clamps, never have enough clamps, the fit and finish of these clamps was as i expected. The only complaint i have with this style of clamp is the head movement when clamping, but that is the only issue, and i read the reviews and new this would be an issue. I am currently glueing up door panels with mine theyu seem to hold as expected. The one thing i will say they are easier to use than the HF models."
4,My first Zelda game,"This game is addicting and very enjoyable. The control scheme is fantastic (very intuitive), while the gameplay is a blast. I really enjoy the problem-solving stages in both Link's human and wolf forms. This is my first Zelda game that I have played because I am not usually an RPG fan, but this game is great!!"
5,"Technically superior to Ocarina of Time, but lacks the ""magic"" of the classic title.","Pros:+ Perfect controls, very satisfying combat+ Classic Zelda gameplay in full force - awesomely clever puzzles and dungeons+ Boss fights are very cool and original+ Beautiful graphics and art style+ Nice sound effects and voicesCons:- Boss fights are WAY too easy- The game doesn't seem to beat you up much at any point; again, too easy- A disappointing lack of anything to do outside the main quest- Lacks the ""magic"" that Ocarina of Time had... feels less epic- Not much to come back to after beating the game"
3,good game ... need to find more time to play,big fan of Zelda but i have no time to play the game im to busy with other things. when i do find time o play i get hooked Nintendo really did a good job with this cant wait till the next Zelda comes out.
5,Amazing Experience,"Zelda TP for Wii is truly a revolutionary experience. A must buy if you own a Nintendo Wii console! And if you don't, what are you doing? Go get a Wii already! ;P"
4,"LOVE the game, HATE the ending.","Absolutely loved this game!! I don't know why people complain about the wiimote and nunchuck, because I think they are quite compatible as controllers. The graffics are terrific as is the storyline, and if you're not using cheats, the game is just difficult enough to keep you interested, but not so difficult that it drives you nuts and you give up, and chuck the wiimote at your poor HDTV. I really love the little villages; they are so quaint and charming (you've guessed it; I'm a chick)! The only thing that I disliked about the game was the end: You can't go back and free-play after the grand finale. (I was hoping to return to the cute little villages and make Link & Zelda ""create"" little sword-and-shield-yielding babies! ;) Ha!) Unfortunately, this kind of ending is typical of Zelda games. Why oh WHY???"
4,best Zelda game ever!,"this game is really fun, but at first, (spoiler) it makes Midna seem evil, when she really is one of the main characters! We got this game for my brother's birthday, and it's great, ecept the only thing the master sword is for is to (another spoiler) stab in the pedstal. I thought it would at least make your sword twice as strong! And when you battle Ganon, Midna dosent give you a hint that helps once! She just makes you think really hard about nothing. Epona is really great, and you can shoot arrows, use your claw-shot, and even swing your sword, but you kinda forget about the horse once you can warp. Overall it's still a great game, though."
5,Amazing,I purchsed this game and a Wii system at launch and imdeiatly was blown away by this game. While the graphics are not as good as those for the XBOX 360 and PS3the gameplay is absolutley breathtaking. The story hooks you imediatly just like with every Zelda game. The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess is amust have for any gamer.
1,Zelda wii,I ordered the wrong game for wii I don't have a wii so I gave it to a friend. They said it played very good.
3,Fun But Frustrating,"I found this game to be very very good in the beginning, but then unfortuantely you get to certain area and it doesn't save it where you left off it keeps bringing you back to the beginning of the segment, and then you have to do it all over again, which I found very frustrating because I would get tired or have to stop after playing for about 2 hours, and when I would save it, and then turn it back on to see where it put me it always put me back to the beginning of this certain segment and I would have to start all over again, very, very frustrating. Other wise I thought the game was very good."
3,Needs a short game with the sword,"When I played this game in the store, I loved how you make Link use his sword by swinging the Wii remote, and he would match your movements. It was like you were really sword fighting!But when I bought it and played it at home, I found out you have to finish several levels before you get even a bad (wood) sword! I tried to play it for awhile, but it was taking forever to finish the necessary levels to get the sword. Instead it was having me do things like herding sheep and talk to the townspeople. I don't want to herd sheep, I want to do some sword fighting!I'm older now, so I don't have as much time or patience to play thru these levels before I get the sword. They should of had a short game or practice mode where you already have a sword and can do some sword fighting. Maybe one day I'll go back to it and try to finish those levels, or get some kid to do it for me."
3,Nothing special IMHO,"This game is ok. I remember playing Zelda as a kid and loved it (20 years ago). This game doesn't seem anything like the old original. The graphics are really good. However it seems like they tried to make this into a World of Warcraft type game with out having to be online and with out the benefit of other players to interact with. You can talk to other computer run characters in the game...a lot like NPC's in WoW, you go on ""quests"" like WoW, and the Zelda world is really vast. However, if this all sounds interesting to you buy WoW instead of Zelda. It is ok but I wish I would have bought something else instead."
2,Disappointing entry in the franchise,"This game has gotten so many rave reviews that I wonder if I played a different version where all the fun and Zelda spirit were left out. I'm a long-time fan of the Zelda games, and eagerly anticipated playing this latest entry. I was very disappointed. From the very beginning and continuing throughout the game, everything felt formulaic and empty, with no real sense of urgency or importance to your missions.It's been a few months since I played Twilight Princess, and I'm sitting here trying to remember the good and bad parts of it. Sadly, I can hardly remember any of it - it's just not memorable like the better installments in the series. There are fun bits in it, certainly, but overall the adventure is dull and unengaging. Recommended for rental only."
4,my first zelda since the first one,I'm impressed at the game.The graffics isn't to bad but its mostly about the gameplay like nintendo has always been good at. This is a good game to get for the wii however its kinda hard to find your way around but is fun.The game can be probly played by kids(younger ones will defintly need help though)and mostly adults
5,the best game ever made,this game is a true classic great music great game play great story this game has it all buy this game you wont be sorry
3,Great Resell Value!,"I bought this game in hopes that it would take me back to my hey day, when I played the Legend Of Zelda. The Wii game was a bit more confused, and as an adult I did not have much time to understand how to play it. Luckly, it resold EXCEPTIONALLY well!"
3,OK but not very clever,"The last Zelda I played was Ocarina for Nintendo 64. It was difficult but I managed to finish it without any help.The current Wii Zelda.Predictable, at times monotonous and where are the voice overs. This is 2008!Perhaps Nintendo thinks Americans have turned stupid. Now we have helpers, guides and dead giveaways in this game. I suppose the game is intendoed <g> for younger kids, so i guess I should ignore the simplicity.I also don't appreciate the ignorant language. Like the aints of the dumb rancher. etc...The first Zelda back in the late 80's was difficult and totally fun.Yes, the Wii controller adds something special.It was OK but still disappointing."
5,AMAZING!!!!!,"This game is definety the best in the zelda games. Only one thing... no orcarina... Link blows on a peice of grass to do stuff, how stupid is that! But when in your wolf form you can howl however you want... but when blowing on grass it does the melody for you. Thats the only problem I dont like with this game, other than that... ITS GREAT!!!!!"
5,really awsome,This is my first zelda game but none the less I was blown away by the incredible storyline and great grafics. THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANY GAMER it has a few pleasingly frustrating puzzles and well thought out characters all in all this is an amazing game
3,A little let done,Not what I thought but my grandchildren enjoyed it more. Looking for LOLO can't find it but will not give up.
5,This is a good game but not for very busy people,This is one of those games you need to sit down and play for a few hours at a time. You will want to do so. Some of the challenges are a little frustrating for novice gamers but you can get through this with a little persistance and a lot of time.
5,"As good as any Zelda yet, maybe better","Ocarina of Time is my favorite game of all time, but this one seems like it is a front runner to take it's spot- it's got the depth and complexity of Ocarina, with better graphics though, and it also took some of the better features from the Wind Waker.I read a review on here that said the controls are awkward and have a slow response time with the Wii controller, but that person is full of it. I haven't had any problems at all. The only reason I can imagine them saying that is maybe they set up their sensor bar wrong, or their sensitivity is off. I find it is amazingly comfortable to have the split controller set up."
3,Disappointed,"The game arrived sooner than anticipated, very happy. Was a little irritated that I was sent the red case one, I wanted the gold case, and the picture showed the gold case when I looked at it."
4,twilight experience,"Twilight Princess on Wii is quite an amazing game. It is a challenging maze and I was quite surprised at the extent of the playing field. There are quite a number of skills and weapons available to use. The only negative aspect was the cutscenes, they were long and a bit boring."
4,One of the best,"After just finishing this game I must say it was one of the most fun I have played in a while. I have been a fan of the Zelda series since the very first one. The overall mechanics to the game are very similar to Orcarina of Time, but with much better graphics, bigger levels, and more items. The best part about the game is the outstanding level design. They are challenging, but not so much that you loose your mind. The story is OK, but how many times can you keep creating the same game? I think this game falls short compared to orcarina of time. That to me was the best Zelda game to date. But this one certainly doesn't disappoint! This will be one of the greatest Wii games ever made."
5,love link!,"im a fan of nintendo games and zelda ones as well, this one has many challenging and intreiging stages, if you love adventureous games im sure you may love this one."
4,Wii Zelda,"I loved Zelda since the original Nintendo game. This game is really cool. Great game, but sometimes you get lost on what are next steps since the game doesn't really gave you instructions or hints. Then a friend gave me the idea of look on youtube and there watching others how it's played I can proceed doing my game. But it is really cool, and you could be hours playing."
5,Great game,"Awesome game that not only exceeded my expectations, but enhanced my joy in the extremely fun and interesting zelda game series. I recommend this game to anyone wishing to start the zelda series as well as those of us who are already zelda fans. Great storyline and concept, as well as great new abilities and weapons all in one action packed game."
5,Best Zelda title so yet,"As my first Zelda game (not inluding Smash Bros.) I was hoping this game would be enjoyable, and it did not dissapoint. This game had good graphics, great gameplay, an exciting story, and also, it had MIDNA. Although it can be quite similiar to other Zelda titles, it will not disapoint if you enjoy playing through another great Lagend of Zelda."
4,Thank you!,Tank you for the quick shipment of the video game. The kid i got it for in exchange of doing some yard work is very happy and pleased with the game.Thank you once again for a great buy and service.
4,"Fun, but you better have a significant amount of time to kill","The graphics are probably the best out there for the Wii and the game utilizes the Wiimote and Nunchuk more completely than any other Wii game I've played. However, I find the way the game saves your state to be lacking, especially in the dungeons. If you don't finish a dungeon in one sitting, then the game starts you off at the entrance when you resume. This means you have to find your way back to where you were, which is not always difficult, but is certainly tedious and means you can't really sit down and play the game for 15-20 minutes and accomplish anything.I very much enjoy completing the tasks and solving the puzzles during the parts of that game that take place outside the dungeons. I never start a dungeon unless I know I have a contiguous block of at least one and a half hours that I can commit to the game. I haven't completed the game yet, though I have finished the first four dungeons."
5,BEST ZELDA GAME EVER!!!!,"I played The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time for the N64 and thought it was the best Zelda game ever. But then I played Twilight Princess for the Wii and LOVED IT!!!! It has classic Zelda action and puzzles and Link looks much better. The graphics are AMAZING, even though the Wii doesn't support high quality HD graphics like a PS3 or 360, but they are still great. The story is also a great one, better than Ocarina of Time. So basically what I am saying is... BUY THIS GAME NOW!!!!"
4,great game very addicting,"i like the controls and the plot, but i guess it may just be not realistic enough for me. im a huge fan of resident evil 4 and other shooting games.. i also think the 'text' when people are talking is a little lame, i would have thought a next-gen game that was as important as zelda would have real voices at this point.. but overall a very entertaining game and definitely worth the 50 hours it takes to beat"
3,lackluster zelda,"I know lots of people are says that this game is great but I found it to be far to easy and uninteresting for a zelda game. I like the wii controller but it's just not enough to pull me into this game for very long. I'm about 4 hours into it right now and I probably will get around to finishing it sometime but I'm in no rush to do it. A lot of the other zelda's, I would stay up for days straight playing them."
1,We are not a gamers,and I haven't figured out how to begin this game. It would be nice if they had a demo on the disc to get us started.
1,Very Disappointing - definitely for kids,I was looking for something as fun and challenging as Resident Evil 4 - THIS IS NOT IT! The graphics are mediocre at best and the dialogue is juvenile. Hard to imagine why anyone over 12 years old would find this interesting.
1,Not for me,I guess this type of game just isn't for me. If you like reading and not a lot of action then this game is for you. The only thing I did like was the way the Wii controller was integrated into the game. I hope more Wii games use the control in this way.
5,5-Stars!,"I got beyond that and it turned out to be one of the best game experiences I've ever had.I can't see how to change from my original 1 star review to 5 stars.I didn't get how to do combat (as the wolf) at first.Earlier review:They took the coolest game ever and they make you stop playing and force you to play THE WORST GAME EVER to be able to get back to the cool game! I swear they must have had a deadline on the Wii Zelda so they pulled some abandoned stupid 'magic imp / wolf' game, sitting on the shelf and interleaved it to extend the playing time of Zelda. Tell me you haven't thought that!I won't go back and play it. Awful. ""Tee hee hee, jump here, tee hee hee."" Gawd! Oh for a shotgun from Quake. No, wait, I'm a wolf I can't hold it, I can only bite and sniff... oh and dig, so I'll just dig my own grave here, somebody shoot me and get me out of this miserable stupid game!"
4,Garanteed fun,"I had quit playing games for a long time (family, job, etc..) but this game brought me back. Even my 3 years old son love it and help me in some steps.The drawback is that the characters can't speak the full sentences."
4,Perfect,"this game is perfect in everything, there is nothing like riding a hours in the wide and full of adventure land of Hyrule, I know lots of ppl are complaining about how easy are the levels and stuff, they are 100% right, but the puzzles are really challenging, the final boss is one of the most important moment in the history of gaming in my own opinion ..Get it, you should never miss a game like this.."
5,Simply put the most incredible gaming experience ever,"This game is simply put the most enjoyable, and captivating game I have ever played, or seen played. I have casually been playing video games with friends my whole life, so I may not offer the insight on the extremely technical aspects of Zelda that other reviews include, but can say with certitude that everyone should spend some time with this game. From the story, to the beautifully sculpted landscape that is endlessly explorable, all the parts come together for a truly amazing experience. I finally beat the game after years of playing it, and as silly as it may sound, miss the game, characters and most of all, Hyrule. Already pre-ordered Skyward Sword and am sure it will be a worthy sequel."
4,Fun and pretty good graphics,"This game is fun, the graphics are pretty good. It looks like a gamecube game so dont expect next generation graphics like PS3/360 but it'll do. I just got a wii and this is the first game I purchased, the controls take about an hour to master. I would recommend this as a must buy if your looking for a good wii title."
4,Zelda?,"I have been playing zelda since the 8 bit era, yes I bought the original way back then, and though the graphics are amazing and the story too it just doesn't feel like a zelda game to me. The game is really easy to get through. Some of the puzzles are difficult but the bosses are way too easy. Over all this game just feels dumbed down which is understandable with a new contoller now. I'm sure nintendo didn't want to make it too difficult for players to use but it does not have the zelda game look or feel to me. It's not a bad game at all and I am enjoying it quite a bit but don't do what I did and expect this to be like the other Zelda's in look and feel. It's totally different. Hope Zelda 2 is deeper."
5,It`s all in the controls,"Even though the graphics like everyone knows can't be compare with PS3 and XBOX360, the human-machine interface makes up for the rest. Now that I have played this game in the WII, I can`t imagine going back to the traditional controls...you get much more involved in the game this way... great game, great platform"
3,Is this really a Wii game?,"First off let me say that I think Twilight Princess is a great game and a definite must have for any Wii owner.However I am extremely dissapointed that the Wii controller is so poorly incorporated into the game.Shake the controller forward and Link will swing his sword. Thats pretty much it.Occassionally you will need to equip an item and use the Wii controller to target something. Of course you'll have to wait 2 or 3 seconds for the controller to aquire a screen lock all while the action is still occuring around you.Combine the lackluster use of the Wii controller with the fact that we are getting gamecube graphics and one has to wonder if this game is really ""next gen"" or not. The fact that there is a gamecube version of this game available speaks for itself."
3,the legend of zelda: twilight princess,This is another of the popular oriental style fantasy adventure games for wii. Suitable for the young adolescent boy age group.
3,"Great game, could use some more challenge and could get away from being childish more.","This game is a classic, for the wii, in my mind. However, if the game was rated M for mature and put more ""adult"" content into it, then it would hit home for the fans of Zelda that have been around since the first Zelda game, and then some. On top of that the game is a beat weak in the true challenge that most gamers look for. The challenge that keeps you frustrated but keeps you interested and still keeps you from getting too far too fast, for example: Super Metroid or Hellgate: London or like some final fantasy games. This game also seems to just keep going and going at some points, making it a bit deterring. Now for the pros: the usage of the wiimote and the nunchuck for the game are very well done, the sword and the sheild are used to an extent that fits the game itself. The plot/storyline makes sense and works with all the other zelda games, as most do."
1,I would not recommend ordering anything from them!,"Customer service is a joke, so don't waste your time writing emails because they never respond. I ordered two books from separate companies at the same time a month ago, I received the one book a week later and STILL do not have the one I needed from NTDbooks. Do not waste your time ordering from them because all you will get is a headache and have to go and find your book elsewhere anyways..."
4,Needed,"Yes, you do need this book if you are buying ""Roma Aeterna"". It is a summary of the grammar and syntax of each chapter."
4,A Sturdy & Effective SAD Light,"I actually found my SADeLite at a thrift store for $7. I recognized it as a SAD Therapy Light because I'd been treating my SAD with light therapy, using the Sunray I Light Box, since 1998. This is a great addition to my therapy regiment, the reflector increases this lamp's light output to therapeutic levels which rival my Sunray. My one gripe is the bulbs are not full-spectrum and that's something I really like about my Sunray box, hence the four stars.It's a sturdy lamp & the replacement bulbs are inexpensive (probably because they are not full spectrum.) You should be able to get 2 bulbs for under $20. Replacing my Sunray's bulbs costs 4x that, which makes this lamp a fantastic value. Remember - bulbs should be switched out every two years, long before they burn out, to maintain therapeutic levels of light intensity! Search online, or inquire at your local hardware store, for Sylvania Dulux replacement bulb, Model # FT36DL/841.ECO"
3,SAD Dirty Lamp,"As soon as I unpacked the lamp I had to get out my cleaning solution and cloths to scrub off darkly colored-marks and strange-looking drips on the reflective surface of the lamp shade, as well as the base and electric cord and plug. I was angry to have paid more than $100 for a dirty lamp, but was not about to pay to ship it back. So I plugged in the SADelite and now am happy to own an amazing lamp. The owner advertised the desk lamp was gently used, but should have revealed it was never wiped off! Unless you're okay with nasty dirty products, I wouldn't recommend buying from this seller. But Northern Techlogies makes a fine lamp. My SAD is now in remission, with 30 minutes exposure each morning. Don't know yet how long the bulbs will last."
1,Too Large and Bulky,The SAD Light Therapy Desk Lamp is bulky and just plain ugly! I wish I had returned it right away.
5,An important work,"For anybody who seeks a new, critical angle to re-evaluate the May Fourth tradition and legacy of China, this book is a must-read. It largely contextualizes and historisizes the May Fourth discourse."
4,My husband loves it,"I think this is a pretty good show. My husband, on the other hand, loves it. He finds it hilariously entertaining. I think it's more of a guy thing. Some of the humor is too base for my taste. All in all its an entertaining show."
3,Fitz,"Great, laugh out loud series. I don't really like the bunny person but it makes for a interesting twist. Good movie."
1,Just go away already!,"Here it is folks, another hammy offering from the pseudo-serious phoney from Canada. I am still in utter disbelief of her mangling of Roy Orbison's classic, ""I Drove All Night."" This song evokes such strong emotions of unattainable love and longing, yet Ms. Dion treats it as though it were just another throw away tune at a smalltown drag bar. Cyndi Lauper reworked this back in 1989 and offered a more strings heavy and hurtful cover. It was AMAZING! Here, Celine is just going through the motions and totally ripping off Cher! I'm sure Cher just rolled her eyes at all those Chrysler commercials while chuckling to herself. Hello! Chrysler!!! Geez, even that she gets wrong! If she had chosen to sell herself out for Mercedes, Toyota or Volkswagen I could at least give her credit for backing a decent automobile...but CHRYSLER?!?! Ugh! Cause I know the first thing that pops into my mind when I think of Sebring is Celine."
1,Will not buy her CD~~~~~,"I must admit, I detest Celine Dion, I have never cared for her voice. I think she's the most overrated singer on earth. I hate the way she must always have the spotlight - the wedding/circus in Vegas, the magazine covers with baby, the television commercials and specials, the billion $ house with monitors everywhere, a helicopter pad (unreal), nannies, housekeepers, cooks, a BUTLER!! - all this even after claiming that she was retiring.I think that she's materialist and narcissistic. So my score for her CD is a big zero. Tho I was forced to put some score there, I still give her a zero."
1,Worst enginered album ever?,"This is the worst overly compressed, lifeless, grainy-sounding CD I hve ever heard. It must be ""water-marked"" so computer geeks can't copy it.You could not have compressed the audio any more if you put it in a Craftsman Vise. This was my first Celine purchase. It will be my last. It is too bad as she does have a nice voice, but she had better get some new engineers quick.I guess if most of her fans listen on boom boxes, car stereos, or mini-systems with MP3 compression they would never know the difference. I have a $10K audio system. ...Jim Tavegia"
1,sorry.. this is crap,"I'm a really big fan of Celine, who buys every album of hers that comes out for the last years. I'm truly sorry to admit that this album SUCKS big time. You want to hear the real Celine Dion? Try S'il Suffisait D'Aimer or Falling Into You. This album is a great disappointment, commercialized and overly sappy. Too bad."
4,One beat shall insite you...,"Being a Dion fan and having attended one of her concerts (Let's talk about love) this album keeps getting better as I keep listening to it. I should start by saying that her voice, in some tracks, is almost completly different but refreshing. As many fans would agree, you can track her growth and maturity in the business as you look back into her carer and previews albums. There are some tracks I skip forward but the ones I can listen to over and over are ""One heart, ""Faith"", ""Coulda woulda shoulda"", ""Forget me not"" and the first single out. Like other listeners and fans, I thought the repetion of songs previously on ""A new day"" were not needed and ""Sorry for love"" is much better as a dance song. All and all Celine will remain my favorite female artist and like the song, I will ""forget her not""."
2,my review,"I read the reviews and I cry over the fact that some people have actually belived them enough to buy the album. If you thought ""A New Day Has Come"" was a poor release, reduce its quality by about 50% and you get this album. The days of excellent radio-friendly chart-driven singles have long since gone from Celines days. With forgettable over-produced songs like ""I Drove All Night"", I encourage Celine to get back to the style of music that made her huge. Gone are the songs that sound like her hits ""My Heart Will Go On"" & ""That's The Way It Is"". In are the hits that are reminessent of recent releases by Britney Spears and the Backstreet Boys. Maybe i am over-exagerating a little, but One Heart is an album that was only released to get the Celine hype up just a little for her new Caesars Tour. Save your money and wait for a real Celine album to release into stores after the tour ends, which will be a while."
4,A Really Wonderful Album...For A While,"After watching Celine Dion's Las Vegas show on television several months ago I finally decided to break down and buy my first Celine Dion album.At first I could not get enough of it. I was listening to it every time I got in my car. Songs like ""In His Touch"", ""Naked"" and ""Je T'aime (Encore)"" really stood out but the whole collection was great.Eventually I found myself only playing the same 3 or 4 songs over and over. The other songs were beginning to wear on me.Now I rarely play any of the songs but when I do I'm likely to play ""Je T'aime (Encore).This is certainly a great pop album - just remember that to much of anything, including a good thing, can be too much."
5,Excellent CD,"This CD is amazing. Celine's talent never ceases to amaze me. the songs are beautiful, laid back, relaxed, and have more of a rocker pop sound, which celine pulls off really well. Celine's Last album was great, and this is even better. This album was released along with her new perfume(which smells wonderful), as well as her new vegas show, ""A New Day..."" This show deserves a review of it's own, but all i can say is, ""wow!"" It is amazing, breathtaking, and magnficent. Celine ROCKS!"
5,A fabulous album,"Although not Celine's best, it is up there, on the whole it is an exceptional album and is truly fabulous."
1,One Heart,"This certainly was a major disappointment. I have always loved every song she has ever sung. What happened? I am not alone. Everyone I have discussed this with agrees. Something terrible has happened with her music. She has such a great voice when singing her ballads. She is right up there with Babs. She's sinking fast with the new producer. Bring back David Foster! These other guys are good, but not for her. Her special voice and talents are being neglected. There's nothing better than David Foster producing her songs as he knows how to bring out the best in her."
1,DID SHE REALLY THINK WE WOULD BE SO STUPID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"CELINE DION.""ONE HEART"". THE GENERAL CONSENSUS BY CELINE'S FANS'IS SELLOUT!!! THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT SHE DID. BY GOD! THERE ARE ONLY ABOUT 7 NEW TRACKS HERE. DID SHE THINK HER FANS WOULD BE SO STUPID AS TO BELIEVE THIS IS NEW MUSIC. THIS WILL COST HER MORE THAN SHE CAN IMAGINE. AT LEAST BE HONEST WITH YOUR FANS. SAY THIS IS PARTIALLY NEW MUSIC. SEVEN TRACKS FROM ONE HEART HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY RELEASED OVER THE YEARS. I WILL ALWAYS LOVE CELINES MUSIC AS WELL AS HER VOICE. BUT I DON'T THINK I WILL EVER BE A BIG FAN AGAIN. AND I'M DEFINATELY NOT ALONE!!!!!!!!CONGRATULATIONS CELINE. YOU'VE OFFICIALLY REACHED MARIAH CAREY STATUS WITH THIS C.D.-LOSS OF FAITH!!!!"
1,WHAT HAPPENNED? IT'S THIS CELINE DION?,"What happened with the feeling in ""Colour Of Love"", with the great produced ""Falling Into You"", and the huge success of ""Let's Talk About Love"", I don't know what the other positive extremely dion's fans are talking about, this album is the worst ever!, I want my money back!, ""I Drove All Night"" I thought it was an error as the first single, but that the rest of the album was great!, I Was so wrong!, even she or the marketing people had to put two tracks from her ""A New Day Has Come"" album, whassup with that?, remixes?, no, no, this album surely kill Celine's career, I don't care if it had sold almost 2 million(Truly Celine's Fans), even to close this Cyndi Lauper version of the leading single ""I Drove All Night"" it's wayyyy superior. Celine please rent a studio in Las Vegas and record again quickly. To not kill the album entirely the best tracks are Stand By Your Side and One Heart."
4,"EURYTHMICS,PRINCE AND THE MAINSTREAM CROWD","The first two tracks are reminiscent of ANNIE LENNOX and PRINCE,so much that you may ask yourself:is that really CÉLINE singing?Obviously,this disc is aim to please the most and probably will just do that.By now,CÉLINE has become an industry by herself.ONE HEART(a SHANIA TWAIN type of song) the title track is ideal for radio success.As a whole,i must admit that the cd is well produced,but is it enough to get us feel something when she sings in ENGLISH?I hope that JE T'AIME ENCORE is the prelude of an another disc with GOLDMAN in the near future.Let us pray the LORD(the manager)for a possible return of the diva singing in FRENCH.Maybe halfway through the LAS VEGAS shows?Aren't you tired of songs that always need to reach the top ten?After all,we've passed the age of driving all night.I am patient and i did not loose interest in CÉLINE yet."
4,Another hit for Celine,"This new CD being released at the same as her tour extravaganza in Vegas, it's not a disappointment. It's refreshing and the upbeat songs are better than any other from her past CDs. My only question is: why did they include two songs already released in her prior album? what was the point of this? just to fill the CD quota? i don't get it."
3,Celine returns to pop!,"I like One Heart better than last year's A New Day Has Come. One Heart has a better mix of uptempo pop songs whereas last year's ANDHC was very adult contemporary.Here are some highlights:I Drove All Night - this is an update of Cyndi Lauper's cover which sounds great. The music has an almost dance club feel and Celine sounds great.Love is All We Need - this one is very Briteny-esqu, no wonder since it's produced by Max Martin (who produced for Britney, Backstreet Boys, and Nsync when they started)One Heart - I like this one, it's an uplifting and fun pop songNaked - a midtempo number, it's got a romantic/sexy vibeSorry for Love - this track is a slow version whereas it was a fast song on the last CDHave You Ever Been in Love - same exact track from the last CD, still a great song though. Hope they release it as a single"
2,"One heart, celine dion","To be honest. I am a big fan of Celine Dion. QUite disappointed with her newest album, One Heart.. which is way beyond my expectation after her fantastic album (New day has come).The beat or the music was so boring.. it doesn't come along with her voice.. and her voice was not too great in this CD in the concept of her voice potential she has.Only 2 songs I like from her album. It's not so creative album, and having 2 old songs from her old album made me think that Celine was not really ready to issue a new album, which is understanding for the time distance between her previous album and this album.Barbary Streisand album is way better than her newest album."
3,good but not her best,"If you bought ""Lets Talk About Love"" and were hoping for more of same (as I did) this is not quite the right album for you. The music is more modern and popish and in general does not maximize Celine's lovely voice.What makes the album worth buying is ""Reveal."" Brilliant song, really the only reason I put ""One Heart"" in my CD player. ""J'Taime encore"" is blah for the first half but has a powerful ending. ""Faith"" is decent, and ""I drove all night"" is OK. The rest aren't worth mentioning.The album is good fun but I expect more from Celine."
5,Couldn't be any better!,"This is by far the best album Celine Dion has put out. It shows a different side of the world's best diva. The songs on this album show Celine's versatility and vocal range. Those who aren't fans of Celine's might want to try this album because it is definitely a different style of music. The songs are more upbeat and ""hip"" than the songs on her other albums. Each song on this CD is very fun and alive! I hope Celine continues to make music like this! Good Job Celine!!!!"
4,GREAT CELINE's CD,"Great CD but I drove all night is not a Cindy Lauper's cover, is a Roy Orbison's one. Cindy Lauper made herself a cover too.If you don't have it yet, buy it."
4,Diva Dion!,"Celine has done another great CD. She truly is an amazing talent. One Heart shows a new side to Celine's talent and offers the listener a refreshing sound. Although, I do have to remark that a couple of the songs are ""Britney Spears"" like, which for me was a turn off. The techno sound is not my favorite but Celine even manages to make that sound good.Overall the CD is worth the purchase, you won't be disappointed."
5,Awesome!,"Celine has once again reinvented herself with her latest album ""One Heart."" Let me be the first to say that it is one heck of an album filled with power ballads and contemporary pop favourites that will inspire anyone.Get this album Now!"
2,Recording Quality Problems,"Buyers beware! The recording quality of this CD is really bad. When I was listening to 4th track, I thought I was listening to an old LP. I also had to adjust bass and treble controls for every song because each one's levels were recorded so differently. I even exchanged my first copy with another thinking that I might have gotten a defective CD, but the second one had the same problems.Even I liked the content of this CD, I couldn't enjoy it as the quality had left a lot to be desired.Last but not least, I am surprised not many people mentioned the quality problem. Could the store where I bought it have had a bad batch?"
3,Not Dion's Best But Not Bad,"I'm generally a huge Celine fan but she in this CD she's abandoned the classic ballad structure that I expect and love from her. I'll certainly be buying her next album, but I'll do so hoping to hear her exercise her voice more than she chose to on ""One Heart."""
4,Uno de sus mejores materiales,"El CD en conjunto es magnífico. Hubiera sido interesante ver qué pasaría si todas las canciones hubieran tenido el ritmo de ""I drove all night"" y ""One heart"". La primera vez que escuché ""I drove all night"" pensé que se trataba de Lara Fabián, pero después de escuchar con atención definitivamente era Celine.Estoy seguro que Celine puede cantar cualquier estilo en el que ella quiera."
3,The Voice is still Powerful but...,As usual Celine displays wonderful vocal ability but the material isn't that exciting. This is my least favorite recording by her.
5,"Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!","This album is so mind-numbingly good, I want to go out and buy a Chrysler. Any kind of Chrysler, just so long as it has a really good Bose brand stereo system so I can listen to my Celine Dion CD (my CD CD!) as I ""Droved All Night!"" I hear that if you mention this album, you can get a very attractive financing package from Chrylser: They even throw in an options package that includes a great 8-speaker Bose brand stereo and a big three-color tattoo of the Chrylser logo!All in all, I give this album 6 out of 7 possible stars. Aerosmith's latest sounds just a little better when played over the Cambridge Soundworks system in a Dodge pickup. You should buy a Dodge instead.You go, Celine!"
4,Loved the album and the Max Martin songs here!,"This is a good album from Celine. I like her forays into electronica with ""I Drove All Night."" The three Max Martin songs are all good, especially the Michael Jackson-sounding ""Love Is All We Need."" I love ""Reveal"" here--a little different to come from her. Her ballads are smoother this time without the big, bombastic sound of her past hits. ""I Drove All Night"" is chance taking, perhaps the fastest-sounding Celine song ever as it moves rapidly at 100 miles an hour as you hear it! I like the newer design of her letters that display her name now on the album cover--very edgy and modern for her."
2,Lifeless pop,"She has a tremendous vocal instrument -- then why is she filtered, echoed and manipulated to sound as cold and lifeless as any other calculated pop recording? Whether riding production that mimics Cher's last 2 albums, or sounding undistinquishable from Shania Twain or Britney Spears -- Dion only rises above the mediocrity with her acceptable cover of ""I Drove All Night"" and the lovely dramatic ballad ""Have You Ever Been In Love,"" which turns out to be from her previous album, which I haven't heard. Otherwise, this new set sounds like a pop record made by machines, rather than humans. A shame since Dion is one of the few current pop stars with a real voice. It's called ""One Heart"" but it has almost zero emotion. Ironic, and a big dissapointment."
2,"One Heart...sadly, not beating :(","I'm disappointed with this recording. I have followed Celine through her many years and recordings. This record will not make her famous. The material is VERY weak. The best songs on the disc are: Drove All Night, Have You Ever Been In Love and Sorry For Love, TWO of the THREE were released on her A New Day Has Come album.This recording lacks energy and the melodies are extremely LAZY. I don't think ""mushy pop"" is too extreme. This record will be relegated to elevators and $.99 bin.I really hate to submit a negative review of Celine Dion for fear of many of you clicking the ""not helpful"" button, so let me end with this: I am reviewing the ALBUM, not Celine's entire career and person. With that in mind, listen to the album and see if you don't agree."
1,this album brings to mind for letters,"[bad]....I miss an album like her 1996 and 1997 albums. Even her Greatest Hits was better than this. Her last two efforts have been [bad] and this one is no better, save your money!!!"
3,One Whatever,"What is Celine doing these days. She seems to have broken into a Britney and NSYNC time zone. Why is she releasing so many albums so soon after each other. ""A New Day Has Come' was pretty good but 'One Heart' is rather manotonous. The fast beats are for Cher not for Celine. 'I Drove All Night' is rather boring and many of the other songs. Please Celine, take a little break between albums or people will get tired of you. Lastly don't try to switch your style too much or you'll end up like Mariah Carey, struggling to recapture her fans."
4,Cynics!,"First of all, ""I Drove all Night"" is not a Cyndi Lauper song. Yes she squealed through it, but it's a Roy Orbison song. Second, who says that there has to be POWER BALLADS on this CD. It's a great CD. It's light, it's catchy and it's different. Celine doesn't always have to be the DIVA. Why can't she sing songs that make her HAPPY??? No, it's not the most eloquent piece of work she's ever done, but it's certainly a good CD. I like it a lot and I've been a Celine watcher long before her English albums. I don't agree that it's a step in the ""wrong"" direction. I think she's a happy woman and she wants to sing like she is! She's reinventing DIVADOM!!I like it!"
4,"Awesome CD, I love her new sound!","""Faith"" and ""I Drove All Night"" are two amazing songs on this album. If you aren't a Celine fan it wouldn't be a good choice for you but Celine fans won't be dissappointed!"
3,bland,"there are only a couple of really hot tunes on this cd. i expected more from celine and hopefully on the next one, she will deliver more of a better selection of congs. this one seemed to be thrown together quickly before her vegas appearances. it's an o.k. effort from a great voice."
5,REALLY REALLY GOOD!,"I don't know what more could be said about this album. I would put it up there with Michael Jackson's Thriller, as far as technical merit. Just as with Jackson's Thriller album, every song on this album could be a hit. I am so glad Celine has gotten away from albums full of nothing but ballads. It is very nice to see her try a new style. I would highly recommend this album."
4,Best singer in the world,"I could have bought this CD in the stores like I did all of Celine's other CD's. Honestly, I found Amazon so much easier and I was shopping there anyway. This was my first shopping experience with Amazon and I loved it. Have made several more purchases."
5,"Wonderful, As Always","I love every single Celine Dion album, but this one has a special place in my heart, tied with the previous album. She taps into such amazing songwriters and lyricists that none of her songs could be confused with any previous song she's sung. Each song is a new, fresh, unique experience. After loving her from her French albums to her very first English release to her most recent endeavors, she doesn't disappoint and knows how to keep the music fresh and relevent. Her music doesn't become dated or tired. This album, in my opinion, is very much under-rated, and I'm surprised it hasn't had more attention. It certainly deserves airtime on the radio much more than some of the tripe that's out there right now."
5,"ONE HEART, ONE ALBUM, ONE GREAT STAR!",SHE WILL DRIVE US TO THE GREAT MUSIC SHE SINGS. THIS ALBUM IS GREAT. CELINE IS ALWAYS OUR STAR! LUCKYS THOSE THATWILL SEE HER IN LAS VEGAS!
1,OH MY GOD,"Every time I think life can't get worse, my wife plays a new Celine Dion CD and I am only thankful that I can run and not hear it.My greatest fear is a greatest hits compilation that contains any of this music."
1,So Disappointing!,"Loud...unsubtle...DISAPPOINTING. Celine is too good a singer to produce such a disappointing CD, and she certainly has too good a voice to have to resort to so much electronic manipulation and distortion. Had planned to go to Las Vegas to see her new show, but this CD gives me second thoughts. I really dislike it!"
2,Very Disappointing,"Celine is one of my all time favorite singers but this cd has very poor song selection. I only like 4 out of 13 songs, and one of the ones I like, ""Have You Ever Been In Love"", is on her previous release. Why does someone put the same song on 2 straight releases? I will always give Celine 5 stars on vocals, but most of the songs on this cd aren't worthy of being sung by such a magnificent voice. Overall this cd is a waste of Celine's great talent."
2,Celine goes 0 for 2 on March 25,"Being a Celine fan I have counted down the days until her new album was released but more importantly her new show to open in Las Vegas. Well, the wait is now over and I couldn't be more disappointed. Let's start with the show: It's a Celine concert but the problem is that the stage is so large she looks like an ant. Dragone (Cirque du Soleil) directed the show but it is in no way Cirque like which it was promoted to be. The best songs that Celine sings during the show are not even hers. She does great renditions of Etta James, Peggy Lee, and Sinatra.... The CD starts of great with ""I drove all night"" but it is down hill from there. Dare I say that Celine sounds more like Britney Spears than vintage Celine."
1,HILARIOUS!,"Okay, now tell me why this cd as an advertisment for ""CHRYSLER"" in it? Yes she has the deal with them, but isn't this ""her album?"" That advertisment makes the cd seem like, you just bought a Chrysler and thats the Cd that they are giving you, the advertisment cd. Simply Hilarious! And she over exagerates her voice, she screams, too much, and acts like she has to prove something to everyone. She's self centered, cocky ever since her Vegas deal, and is really one of the ugliest female singers i have ever seen. She is not even pretty...she's straight ugly! When she screams, it's like, skip the song. The next song starts with her screaming, so you skip that one too! Sorry Celine, you're ight, but you need a lesson or two on how to control your voice, and you need to learn how to write your own music, oops, i guess not everyone can be like mariah, but oh well. She might have some good songs....FROM HER EARLIER CAREER!..but this cd is just blah! All I have to say about that!"
3,Very commercial,"I have always been a huge fan of Celine and always will be but this album was a little disappointing to me. I think her music is becoming too pop-ish. Although there are a few ballads in this CD, I find most of her songs too boring. Yeah, there's a nice beat but so what?? She's not using her range in her voice anymore. My favorite album from her is ""Colour of my World"". That was one of her best. If you compare that one to One Heart, you can tell what a big difference her songs have become. I understand she's promoting this CD because of her new show in Las Vegas and those Chyrsler commercials. I have to admit this is not very 'Celine'. I hope she goes back to using her real voice again. I'll still listen to One Heart once in a while but I won't wear it out like her earlier CDs."
2,EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED,"I have always liked Celine Dion's work. I have every cd she has made, yet I was EXTREMELY disappointed with One Heart. From the moment I took the cd out of the case and saw the CHRYSLER logo on the paper inset inside the case (The paper in between 2 pieces of plastic, that on the other side has the song titles), to the moment that I heard all the songs, I was disappointed. I drove all night is excellent, but the next track, Love is all we need is horrible, and the quality of the music just descends from there. I hope Celine focuses on quality and not $$$ for her next record, because if she keeps selling out, eventually there will be nothing to sell."
3,Another mediocre Celine album...,"Sure, there are six tracks on here that I find appealing, but it's not something I really want to buy. I love Love Is All We Need! Celine does a heavy pop song while staying true to herself and utilizing her vocal range. Other songs I love are One Heart, In His Touch, Naked, Sorry For Love, And Have You Ever Been In Love. One Heart and Naked are midtempo upbeat songs-great for singing along to in the car! In His Touch, Sorry For Love, and Have You Ever Been In Love are great ballads that stay stuck in your head for a long time! The rest of the tracks are just bland filler material-great for playing in a Foley's department store or on an elevator!"
1,I just wished I had read the low reviews!,I love Celine Dion and I wanted another album to sing my heart out to and this isn't it. It's not worth buying if your looking for the music that made you fall in love with Celine Dion! All the low reviews are 100%
3,Disappointing,"I always buy Céline's albums, I was really happy when she came back with A New Day Has Come. A year latter I was disappointed by the release of One Heart. In this album you'll find the typical ballads, and some up tempo songs. `Love is all we need' is the worst, it sounds like Britney Spears; the new version of `Sorry for love' should be banished `cause it has the same beat all along. Songs that you must listen: Have you ever been in love (previously released in A New Day Has come), In his touch and Je t'aime encore (it's in English)."
5,5 Stars For One Heart,This is a great cd. She really fits with the pop music sound. Her voice makes them sound so much better than some pop music today. I bought this cd so late because i thought it would be another one of those ballad albums she does. But then i saw the one heart video and decided to give it a try. Its awesome. But the Chrysler imprint was not necessary. She sold this whole cd to them. And she is kind of selfish for putting Have You Ever Been In Love on this cd and had to nerve to make a video for it to promote her Vegas Show. Great cd thoughBest Songs:Love Is All We NeedOne HeartFaithIn His TouchRevealJetaime EncoreI Drove All Night (Not the best cover song but its ok)
4,Celine is back!!!! Again!,"Celine's new album is addictive and fun, its also much more cohesive than many of her previous releases. It has an up to date dirty pop sound that should please her die hard fans and those new to her. The songs range from catchy dance floor numbers to sultry torch songs. Its a keeper all the way through, except for the inexplicable inclusion of ""Have You Ever Been in Love"" a song from her last album released just one year ago. ""Sorry for Love"" is from the last album too, but at least its a newly produced version. ""Have You Ever Been in Love"" is a good song, but doesn't belong on this album; not only because of it's previous release, but also because it's sound doesn't mesh with the other songs which are all very contemporary dirty pop. But aside from this, its a step in the right direction from everyone's favorite chest thumping Canadian diva."
4,"Not exactly the usual fare, but good anyway....","I actually haven't listened to the entire record yet, but here's my opinion. One Heart, stylistically, has more of a pure pop sound than any other record by Celine. While there still remain some slower songs that are more like her usual style, this record seems to take its cue from previously recorded songs like Rain, Tax and Sorry For Love. The latter song is featured on this record as the 2003 version; however the original is still better. Highlights include I Drove All Night, One Heart, In His Touch, and J'Taime Encore. Overall, while it is different, One Heart is a good record that marks a new direction for Celine Dion, perhaps the best vocalist in music today."
1,Go to hell,"HIAC is just like WCW Greed...THE POO SMACKING,GARGABE EATING,DISGUSTING PIECE OF WRESTLING JUNK I'VE SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.The wrestling is ok but it's still bad.The only good match on the card was the Legacy-DX closing match.The rest are third-rate at best.The first 2 HIAC matches hardly use the cell at all.Only the closing match used it to their edge.You can blame WWE's PG rating for allowing no blood to be shown. Morons. I give this PPV a 1 out of 10."
5,The best I have heard in years.,"I have heard lot's of Gospel but this is by far the best. Each song is better than the Last. But ""Come to Jesus"" is my favorite.I play just before Sunday service over the sound system and My pastor now want's his own copy!"
3,It is a good product but costs way too much.,"I am a physical therapist and have had several of my clients with pelvic floor pain and dysfunction purchace the crystal wand. Although it is an excellent tool, the cost is way too much for a small piece of acrylic. It should be no more than $30 tops with the shipping and handling included."
1,too tiny,"The mirror is too small to be useful as a travel mirror. If you stick it to a bathroom mirror, in many hotels it would be too far from the user to enable the user to focus without leaning far across the vanity top toward the mirror. It functions best as a hand-held mirror."
3,A useful resource,"Suggestions and anecdotes in _Stick Up For Yourself_ are helpful for opening discussions with little ones, particularly those who may be socially sensitive or (too) highly adaptable. I don't agree with all its suggestions, but the basic premise is sound -- that to develop personal integrity and firmness of resolve requires thoughtful practice -- and overall, it's a nice resource."
5,Helping your child's Self Esteem,This is an excellent book. My son and I read a little bit of it at bedtime and keep a notebook to jot down our thoughts. It has improved his self-worth and it has helped me relearn social skills that I should be using in my own life.
3,Good book,The book is good for helping students learn how to stick up for themselves. Good for elementary and middle school.
2,Doesn't really keep hands warm,"My fingers still got cold when using these gloves, and the outside temperature wasn't even below freezing. They do work better than other gloves I have tried, but not anywhere good enough.They are also hard to grab things with the thick fingers.For the price and product description, they should keep my fingers warmer."
5,Ironclad Tundra Gloves,"These are the best cold weather gloves you can get..they are worth every penny that you pay for them...as a material handler who works out in the elements, these are the best glove to have on your hands in the cold weather..the dexterity is excellent and I've had to take them off in the winter in the freezing weather because my hands got too hot! One downside is that once these get wet inside, they stay wet....."
2,Work Gloves Good/Cold Weather Wet Work Gloves Not So Good,"The gloves are good for cold weather with 200g of insulation but for snow removal/wet snow removal in 30 min's my hands were cold and still dry. I could see the break down in the glove's ability to be waterproof. However I bought these gloves to keep my hands dry, waterproof, and warm. These gloves failed in the warm category. When the glove's got wet and started retaining water my hands got cold this happened about 30 min's into snow removal. The work part of the gloves has held up for being tough."
2,"Too big, too bulky, too much money","The glove isn't very flexible and is hard to move in. It's too big and bulky, and way too much money for what it is. I like the Youngstown gloves a lot better for winter work."
4,Good Gloves,I recenly bought thes gloves to make my winter work easier. So far I have not been disappointed. I poured concrete with them and they proved to be waterproof on the clean up. They protect against the cold better than I expected. Combines the warmth of a good winter glove and the toughness Ironclad is famos for.
4,Great Gloves!,"My guy loves these gloves, they are warm,tough and let him get the job done. They don't last as long as they used to."
1,Lasted a day,"I used these gloves for a day, riding a snowmobile. The leather tore in multiple spots, but my hands did stay dry. I did not use these gloves to the extent as I would for work at home. All in all I was pretty disappointed. Cheaper gloves have lasted me a whole season."
2,crooked,"I've ordered this in the past and it was great,until it got lost. I ordered it again as a gift to someone. The ""SF"" logo on this one came crooked, off center, and tilted. A little disappointed considering I paid extra to have my order rushed. The clamp connecting it to the key chain is also half open, which explains why the first one got lost (probably fell off). Too late for me to return it, considering it is a gift. Exchanging it is not worth the time/shipping fees. I'll live with it."
2,Its not what I expected.,All I wanted it to do was open a bottle. It really doesn't work that well. A $1 would work better.
2,"Talent, intelligence and depraved polemic","Judt is an enormously talented and intelligent historian. He has a great capacity for work , and his work on Post-War Europe is remarkable in scope. At the same time he is a two- bit ideologue whose anti- Americanism and anti-Zionism put him in the Noam Chomsky camp. His immoral attacks on Israel are part of his general misperception of the general world situation, and minimizing of the radical- Islamic threat to the West.He is an outstanding example of the truth that tremendous intelligence does not guarantee basic decency."
2,Confusing,"This was the first Dorothy L. Sayers books I read and it took me FOREVER to read it. Not that it's a long book, it's just extremely confusing. One of the things I like about mysteries is trying to figure out whodunit, and with this book that was practically impossible. One of the other reviewers used the phrase ""incessant clutter"" and I have to agree with them.On the other hand, the idea was good. An artist dies, and six people absolutely hate him. Five are red herrings. Also, Wimsey is a rather likeable character, so I give it two stars. Definitely not my favorite mystery book."
2,Reads like a written math problem,"Though I am a huge fan of the Lord Peter series, this novel lacks the witty dialogue that provides so much of the charm in her work. This is full of time tables, bus schedules, and far to little of Lord Peter's perspective. I suppose most popular writers occasionally publish an uninspired lemon to meet a deadline."
3,Murder Must Advertise? You must be joking!,"I agree that this is one of Sayers' weaker mysteries, but Murder Must Advertise is much, much worse. For beginners, I'd start with Whose Body?, The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club, or the short stories (which are all together in Lord Peter).Of course, if one wants the most experimental of her mysteries, there is Gaudy Night, which combines a novel with a detective book. Or if one wants her MASTERPIECE, then it's The Nine Tailors. Those who like a little highbrow romantic comedy mixed in will want to read Have His Carcass, and Busman's Honeymoon.The best idea, however, is to read them all."
3,Least favorite Wimsey book,I am a fan of LPW but this is my least favorite of his - it's all about train schedules and timing. Very boring and leaves little room for character development.
2,"One red herring is often a waste of time, so five are...?","This is the type of mystery that brings out the parodists. Any Monty Python fan can tell you that one of their great sketches deals with a murder mystery that was entirely based on train schedules. I remember thinking when I saw that,""How silly."" Well, that's a whole section of this mystery,an actual train time schedule makes an appearance as a way proving whether or not one of the suspects could have committed the crime in question. The death of an artist brings about a variety of possible of solutions and killers each with ridiculous alibis and page after page is spent disproving them only finding another dead end. I slogged through this one reaching the inevitable unsatisfactory solution which is in itself a cheat and just nodded my head ruefully."
1,Have you heard of a good book??!!,"If you want a good book, this would NOT be my choice in a million years."
3,Disappointing followup,"Shemekia Copeland suffered from some uneven songwriting and ameteurish production in her early CDs, which were rectified in her breakout CD ""Talking to Strangers"". However, she overshot that optimal point with ""The Soul Truth"", which comes across mostly as a big band-driven ego trip; examples include ""Better Not Touch"" and ""Givin' Up You"". ""Who Stole My Radio""'s theme of bland radio was covered much better by Tom Petty earlier. ""Uptown Line"" is a weird pseudo-rap tune. The horns and backgroud vocals are a little too much. Some of the tracks are good, including her duet with Dobie Gray (""Used"") and the last track, the acoustic ""Something Heavy"". No question the woman can sing, and producer Steve Cropper also plays a mean guitar, but this album will disappoint blues and Shemekia Copeland fans. She needs to get back to her roots lest she become just another diva."
5,The Soul Truth - Shemekia Copeland,Shemekia has one of the smoothest and equally hard driving voices leaving the listener wanting more. Her accompaniment is also excellent.
3,Keepin' the Blues alive,"All her CD's are great, and this is no exception. This is set is more pop & Soul than the Rock & Country-fied Blues of her previous 3 albums. ""Used"" is a beautiful duet."
2,Low Quality,Fell apart very quickly.I'd go with a Microsoft Optical for the price it's much higher quality and will last you a long time.
5,Tammy will reach right into your heart,I have been a Tammy Wynette fan for several decades. Her voice has a magical quality that pulls you right intoher songs. Makes you feel like every song is your song. Her voice can tear your heart out. If you havebeen hurt by the pain and power of love this album is your catharsis.
5,Classic Country & Tammy Wynette,"This is a classic album to have in your collection of country music. It's the only Tammy Wynette album you'll need. She's no pushover. She's not saying to ""stand by your man"" cause it's what you have to do cause you're a woman. She's saying he's a weak and maybe stupid, ""after all He's just a man"" and if you want to it would be a nice thing.All the songs are great."
2,"Its content is good, but it is difficult to read and use","The etymology is clear and concise, and it is the part i used quite often. However, its letter size is too small; it is about not larger than a size #6. It is very difficult to read and use. Each time I need to take off my reading glass and read the fine printed words in a very close range. What a way to punish a reader!"
2,Clumping is soft and collects at bottom of litter pan,"This is the worst clumping litter I've tried, but it didn't smell bad. I could have used clay litter with similar effect but it would have made more mud."
5,I Want you to know,"Paul and Annie have made their best album together yet! Paul has a masterfull command of the blues that was evident even when we were growing up as kids and playing in bands in the Connecticut area in the mid sixties. I had the pleasure of jamming with Paul and Annie a few years ago at my home and her harp playing even then was the best I had heard and given her young age, was downright scarey! Now as evident on this latest release she has developed into a full blown harp monster! Together, Paul and Annie who share the lead vocal spots, along with Annie's harmonica and Pauls masterful blues guitar playing will give any blues lover a rare treat indeed. A must have!"
3,DVD,"This dvd i have not open yet. So therefore, i give it a neutral. I do believe when i watch it, it will be good."
1,Don't Buy,"This dvd sucked.It's the worse dvd WWE has ever put out.They didn't talk to no other superstars that worked with Macho Man.The Rock dvd was done in the same format, but was 100 times better."
3,unimpressive due to no current savage interviews,This has plenty of matches including Savage/Steamboat WM 3 and a real good match with Shawn Michaels from 1991 or 1992 and a couple of good old pre match stuff with Gene Okerlund but most of the content is forgettable.
4,Excellent!,"An excellent collection, representing the best of the late 80s and early 90s Macho Man. My only issue was the video quality, which was quite mediocre (you can see artifacts sometimes). In addition, a few of my favorite Macho matches, like the cage match with Hogan at Uncensored 98, are left out. Striker and Maria surprisingly pull this one off too. Buy it now!"
1,Wow this is disappointing,"Wow...I waited a long time for this Savage DVD and couldnt be more let down. Yes there are a ton of matches but I wanted the Randy Savage story. This gives you absolutley nothing other than matches we can pretty much get anywhere. To have Matt Striker and Maria do the commentary on this DVD is an insult and a joke. This is easily the worst WWF/WWE dvd I have seen. To do this right they needed a sit down with Savage and interview other guys he wrestled with to give you a story, a little behind the scenes details. I wont be happy until they give us a DVD about Savage with some substance."
4,The Wrestling Saves this DVD,"I have been waiting on this DVD for years. I am a life long Macho Man fan so I went and bought it first thing this morning and popped it in my DVD player as soon as I got home. First thing ,to my suprise, the people hosting the DVD was Matt Striker and Maria. This is a legend and the best WWE could get to host it is these two? Believe me these 2 idiots try their best to make this DVD unwatchable. Matt Stiker constantly does a Macho Man impersonation. I am sure he thinks its hilarious, and it may have been if done once or twice, but its just annoying after a while. Ohh he also flirts with Maria alot. Hilarious! Maria in turn just acts like a stupid ditz the whole DVD. Then in the second DVD Matt calls Maria ""Miss Maria"" what an insult to Miss Elizabeth. Just do yourself a favor skip straight to the matches cause the stupidity exchanged between these two is unbearable. It would have been 5 stars except for the two idiots."
3,Good Collection of matches but not enough background,The Randy Savage Ultimate Collection DVD gives you a great assortment of matches. I was really shocked to see some of his WCW matches on there that I though would be left out due to his relationship with Vince in the latter part of his career. Overall I enjoyed the DVD but was disappointed to not get enough behind the scenes locker room storylines. They really didn't cover his relationships with Vince to much or the storylines with why he ended up going into the WCW. I am happy that they did release the DVD though it would of been a tragedy if they had left one of the Greatest of all-time without a legacy and backdrop to settle in to the sunset with. Overall a good pickup now all we need is a hall of fame nod for the Madness...OOOOOHHH YEAAAA !
2,NO DOCUMENTARY?!?!,"This is a great collection of matches but is lacking a documentary! When I bought this I was looking forward to hearing stories from Savage himself, but Macho doesn't even make an appearance as his current self. Also, the co-host are AWFUL! I wish this were more like the Dusty Rhodes DVD set with Savage himself doing most of the talking."
3,OHHH NOOOOOOO DIG ITTTTTTT!,"The reason I only give this 3 stars is because of the hosts. WWE could've atleast had Mean Gene or even Ric Flair to host this! Rating With the hosts/matches- 3 stars/ matches ONLY 13 stars. Just skip to the matches DIG IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's about time the WWF,... excuse me wwe released a dvd of 1 of the 5 greatest wrestlers in not only WWF but wrestling history. It's pathetic how Vinnie Mac chose 2 idiots like matt striker (who the H*ll is he?!) and maria (a blonde in a Hispanic body)to host this. Does Vince hate Macho so bad that he would insult him by having these 2 morons host this! It's a joke,the only reason I bought it was because it does have some hard to find matches, BUT I wish I could get my money back now. Trust me, as others have already reviewed on this site, skip straight to the matches. ...DIG ITTTTTTT!"
4,oooohhh yeah!!!!,I was very pleased with the match selection.The win to loss ratio is very good.The losses are important to his career.
2,Could have been a LOT better,"I enjoyed watching the matches and they made me feel 15 again so that was fun. But who arranged this DVD? The special features are going all over the place and in no particular order. Why not just run it all together? And why was the meeting of the Madness and the Mania simply glossed over? Holy Cow! Vince McMahon declared we were witnessing one of the greatest moments in the annals of sports history and it was barely touched on when the entire match should have been shown. In short, I like the matches but very disappointing otherwise."
4,Macho Madness,Great Matches. Great Stories. Great DVD. Could due without the Matt Striker & Maria flirting though. WWE bombed on that one.
3,Rehashed Madness! Ooo yeaah!,"Going to make this short and sweet. The only gripes I have with the dvd set is 1. No documentary, and 2. Lots of rehashed match selections from Wrestlemania and SummerSlam. There are a few rare gems that hit this release with disc three, which one of them being Flair/HBK VS Macho/Bret Hart...what a treat! All in all this is a great set for new fans. For the hardcore fan, I picked it up for the rare gems. 3 stars from me."
3,"Good, but not his best","YES, I LEARNED A LOT AND FEEL BETTER ABOUT THE BOOK NOW THAT I AM FINISHED. I DO HOWEVER, FEEL THE BOOK DRAGGED AND WAS SOMEWHAT DRY. UNLIKE MANY OF THE OTHER REVIEWS I READ HERE, THIS WAS NOT ONE BOOK I COULDN'T PUT DOWN. I HAVE READ 8 MICHENER NOVELS AND CONSIDER HIS WORK TO BE AMONG THE BEST, BUT TO DATE THIS HAS BEEN THE WEAKEST. AS USUAL THERE ARE MANY INTERESTING HISTORICAL EVENTS THAT MICHENER PUTS IN PERSPECTIVE, IN AN EASY TO UNDERSTAND MANNER."
4,An epic novel of the West,I wish Michener would have lived long enough to write a book on California. I love his format of taking a specific geographic area and recounting the history of it. And in Centennial he does just that in truly grand fashion. This book has everything from dinosaurs to cattle drives
5,Epic history of the West,"This book is the only writing of Michener that I have read to date. I watched the mini-series years ago and then I read the book. The story is a wonderful story about the settling of the West and the hardships that the settlers and the Indians alike endured. It is a must read for any history buff. I would also recommend that if you are ever given the chance to see the mini-series, it is well worth the 21 hours to watch it."
5,wonderfully woven story!,"In response to Washington USA, YES, the mini-series is worthy of the book. In the late '70s I was reading/watching them hand-in-hand. Without trying to sound sexist, ""Centennial"" has a lot of terrific roles for men -- and the actors fit the bill. Off the top of my head, here are a few (forgive the spellings, I don't have the book with me):Robert Conrad as Pasquinel; Richard Chamberlain as McKeag; Gregory Harrison as Levi Zendt; Dennis Weaver as Poteet, the traill boss; Brian Keith as the sheriff; Richard Crenna as the dad Skimmerhorn; Cliff DeYoung as the son Skimmerhorn; Anthony Zerbe as Wendell (he was really good!); Alex Karras as Brumbaugh (he had the build); Timothy Dalton & Lynn Redgrave as the English cattle barons; and David Janssen was a great narrator.Please e-mail me if you have any questions about the mini-series."
2,I am Joe's bison,"I have not read any other Michener books, and after snoozing through the first 120 pages of this book without finding a single chapter of interest, I don't think I will. This isn't a novel, which in my mind should have memorable characters and an interesting plot; rather, it's a sort of history book-lite written on a Reader's Digest level that never really grabs you. My fellow 2-star reviewers have laid it out pretty well, so I won't rehash. This is just boring, even horrible, reading. I guess it just goes to show that a ""runaway best seller"" doesn't necessarily have to have any actual literary value."
2,Horribly Boring,"I read the Source and loved it and bought almost every Michener book written. This book made me regret that rash decision. The storyline is not nearly as interesting nor as awe inspiring. Even worse I do not care about sheep ranching or irrigation, and certainly not as much as this book requires. I felt like I was reading a science text book and not a novel."
2,Horribly dull book,...I gave this book 500 pages and that's enough to condem it.Basically it's the history of Colorado. It starts out in a long explanation of everything that's going to come in the next dozen chapters and then it continues to tell about a dinosaur. The next couple of chapters write about settlers and Indians and none of them are all that exciting. Michener really captures the tedious lifestyle of the Plains settler with nothing to do and that's not a good thing.By the time we get to the sheep farmers vs. the cattle ranchers I just had to put the book down and forget about it. I never came back to it and I don't mind.
3,I just can't seem to enjoy books with a western theme.,"I read almost exactly half of this book. What I read I found enjoyable. Unfortunitaly I have other reading interests (fantasy, horror) that just don't make it worth my while to read a very long western style book.I give high praise for James Michener. I'm sure that I will read more of him in the future. But for now I must put this book aside to focus on other reading interests that are more enjoyable to my tastes.""Centennial"" is a good book, its just that after reading half of it I've decided to move on to other things."
3,Centennial is more than a book!,"I first read Centennial when the mini-series came out. Back then the cover art showed character faces. Sadly it's been so long I can't remember the book. But the cover art surely rated 3 stars back then. In reading people's reviews I thought, didn't anyone ever see the mini-series or try to buy the 12 chapter videos? I believe the book can be better appreciated if the film version can be bought so you can see the characters come alive!"
3,Concise Introduction to Office,"This is a very well-written, very concise introduction to Microsoft Office 2003. It's also very reasonably priced. So: how come I cannot award it five stars? Easy: the screen shots are way too small; either you will need to read this book outside in bright sunshine or you will need a magnifying glass. It's not a ""Visual"" Quickstart Guide; it's an ""Unvisual"" Quickstart Guide. I don't know what's happened to the publisher (Peachpit Press), but years ago the screen shots in their books were nice and big. C'mon, Peachpit, bring back the large and legible screen shots. Then you'll earn the five stars you covet."
5,christmas family reunion,a movie about changing the way you feel and think . I think we all could do with that hope /happiness and family/friends all year round
4,"Liked ""A Different KInd of Christmas""","A Different Kind of Christmas is different but in a good way. The father has and always had good intentions, unfortunately the daughter didn't know the whole story so many years were taken away from them because of the bitterness and unforgiveness. Thankfully, the truth becomes known and now they can become a family again and the son gets a grandpa and mabey a step father if there is a part 2.As far as, If You Believe, I didn't like about the first half of it, if you can get past that, it becomes a movie to watch."
5,Another Hit!,"I rememeber seeing If You Believe Years ago, and thought the little girl would go places - and she did, of course, Hayden Panettiere! It is a beautiful story and I would have paid the price for just that movie, but it also included another Christmas movie as a set. Well worth the price and a great addition to your Christmas Movie Collection>"
2,Family friendly,"These movies can be watched by the entire family. If you beleive is a little unbelievable. Kind of an inner child sort of thing,. But the the one, made this purchase worthwhile. How one person can take playing Santa too far, but in the end is good overall."
4,I LOVE FILM NOIR,"I remember seeing some of these films on TV years and years ago. I could not appreciate the artistry then but I do now. ""The Sniper"" was quite thrilling. ""The Line-Up"" had a bravura performance by Eli Wallach. ""Murder By Contract"" showed Vince Edwards could indeed act. Before there was ""Ocean's Eleven"" there was ""Five Against the House."" And as for ""The Big Heat""....well it has Glenn Ford....enough said. Sony/Columbia has gone from the worst home video provider to the best. And thank goodness they have!"
4,INDISPENSABLE,"***** THE BIG HEATHere's another film I use to watch when I despair of cinema's future. Gloria Grahame's performance is unique as well as Lee Marvin's. Masterpiece.** 5 AGAINST THE HOUSEWeak crime movie with an interesting Brian Keith performance. That's all.***** THE LINEUPAn extremely brisk beginning, a pair of villains that will haunt you for days, Richard Jaeckel as the alcoholic wheelman, social etiquette taught by a gay Pygmalion to a psychopathic hit man. 86 minutes of sheer pleasure. Masterpiece.***** MURDER BY CONTRACTI understand now why Martin Scorsese admired so much Irving Lerner. With a simple guitar melody playing while Vince Edwards is dressing up, Irving Lerner emerges as a one of a kind director. The rest of Murder by Contract is in accordance with this mythical beginning. Masterpiece.*** THE SNIPERProgressive Stanley Kramer production. The murders, in my opinion, are very violent considering it's a 1952 movie. Recommended."
3,A bit disappointing,Lusted after these before buying. But they turned out to be too stiff and shiny to be a good addition to my wardrobe. Alas.
3,mediocre electrodes,"Very average electrodes. I am a chiropractor and have noticed chatanooga quality going downhill in last few years. Essentially, you get what you pay for. cheap electrodes for cheap price."
5,Last Punks Standing,"Old Enough to know better was my introduction to The Bulemics. The perfect antidote to fake ""punk"" like Green Day and My Chemical Romance. Hope the kids are corrupted by this beautiful filth, like I was in my day by Black Flag, Circle Jerks,G.G. Allin, etc. Kids actually listen to Miley Cyrus and Britney Spears?! WTF! After you have listened to this, run and buy ""Soundtrack to the Apocalypse"". All other bands suck. The Bulemics are the Last Punks Standing."
4,Top Notch All Purpose Printer,"This printer's speed, text and graphics are all excellent. I print about 50 pages a day and it always operates trouble-free.I am only giving it four stars, not five, for one reason: it is no longer possible to replace the original Canon ink cartridges with cheaper compatible ink cartridges because the originals now come with a chip. That makes the cost of replacing the four ink cartridges around $55 unless you're willing to mess around with transferring the chips to a compatible cartridge yourself.Unfortunately, the other print manufacturers have taken similar steps to prevent people from using the compatible ink.If you do a lot of printing like I do the solution is to install a continuous ink system."
2,Great printer until it stopped working.,"I had very positive results with this printer, until it just gave up the ghost one day. I used it on my mac for about two years. I certainly didn't abuse it or use it heavily. One day it just stopped responding -- I couldn't even turn it on. Now its going to our local electronics recycling station. For the price I paid, I expected more."
5,Really interesting book,"If history of warfare, especially history of firearms is your passion - its's book for you.Have you ever thought: ok, black powder is first known explosive - but how ""historical people"" made it? How do they made saltpeter? From where sulphur comes form - if you don't have sulphur mine? How do they mix all together - without blowing themselves up?I know, it's quite small book - but it's stuffed with very interesting facts - and useful information (of course if you ever thought about ""experimental archaeology"" in this specificity area)"
2,Keep this book dry,"The dry pages will help you build a nice fire to keep you warm during your next camping trip and it will burn better than the do it yourself gunpowder in the recipes. Don't read this book around the camp fire because a scary story will be much more entertaining. This book is proof that you, too, can get a book published even if it's only about roasting bugs with a magnifying glass which is also much better campfire lore."
3,An ok book...,"Ok, this book is ok. There are only two different recipes to make is the problem, but I did give it three stars because it has good information and tells you how to get the materials without having to buy them at the store. It also looks like the recipes could take quite a while to make."
2,Pretty Thin Tome on Gunpowder,"I was expecting a bit more than I got in this little book. Maybe if I were a true survivalist, it might be more relevant. Anyway, I will keep it if for no other reason than to have a resource if I ever need to make my own black power. I feel bad giving this a sour review, but it was a disappointment. Maybe it's just me.I did feel that many of the ""recipes"" were very difficult procedures, and it would be very unlikely that I could pull them off."
2,Not what I expected,"I was thinking that it was for different formulas for black powder. It turn out to be for making the chemicals for black powder. If you search the web you get better information, then whats in this book."
2,Not What I Expected,"Although the book is very interesting, it really didn't have in it what I thought would be in it. I actually bought the book for my husband, who is into model rocketry and is making his own rocket engines and I thought this book would be informative enough to teach him to make the black powder that goes in them. Well, it is...if you have ten years to wait for everything to cure and get to a point where it's ""good"" enough to use for black powder. I really did think he could put the knowledge he gained there to work immediately and therefore I was disappointed in the content of the book. If you have ten years to wait for everything to come together then this is a book for you. If you want to put the knowledge to work for you right away, forget it!"
3,not as easy as it sounds,"This book is moderately interesting for its history of gun powder, although culturing your own salt peter or sulfur seem like they would be more trouble than they are worth"
3,cia tek,covers mainly the useless cia tek(precipitation tek)better info free on the nett. make a ball mill and you can make pro gunpowder easy
3,This is a Neat Little Book,"There aren't many advantages to making your own gunpowder these days, much less your own gunpowder ingredients, but this little book covers all of it, along with some interesting history (including the impressive number of people who have blown themselves up, along with factories, shops villages and so forth). He does remind us of safety rules, but somehow it falls short of what some goofball on the internet might do with the information. Still, definitely something I'd want to be able to do if I needed to, so here it is."
3,Only ok,"The book is ok, and I am glad to have it as an additional reference. However, it copies the black powder and red-or-white propellant recipies from the Army manual TM 31-210, Improvised Munitions Handbook. If you can only afford one book, buy the Army manual, which is also readily available on Amazon."
4,John Brim Comes Back From Obscurity,"John Brim began playing music as a teenager while growing up in Kentucky. he moved to Chicago in 1945 and over the next two decades he played with John Lee ""Sonny Boy"" Williamson, Eddie Boyd, Muddy Waters, Jimmy reed and others. When the Blues declined in the 1960's he faded out of the limelight.This album shows that John Brim can still front a band with style. Backed by top Blues players like Bob Margolin on guitar and the amazing Jerry Portnoy on harmonica, Brim sings with panache, exhibiting that over the intervening years, he's kept up his chops. I'd even recommend that you get yourself a recording of ""Ice Cream Man"" from the 1950's and compare it to this later version. Very nice indeed."
2,a total snooze-fest,"this was a very boring documentary. The quality is amateur at best. Poor sound quality, long/monotone opinions from the same experts over and over again. It has some good information, but the presentation is very boring!"
5,Great!,"Its a good good ballad and I love it. I also love the 2nd track ""Sailing"" The live version from their In Concert Disney Channel Special, that was very well done!"
5,A GREAT SINGLE,"NSYNC CD SINGLE FOR ""A LITTLE MORE TIME ON YOU"" IS COOL. I LIKE THE VIDEO AND THE SIGNED PICTURE OF THEM. I LOVE NSYNC. NSYNC FANS E-MAIL ME AT NSYNC_GIRL_2000@GURLMAIL.COM FOR WEEKLY UPDATE AND QUIZ AND OTHER FUN STUFF."
5,Don't you just love enhanced CD's?,"I'm so glad that the video was included on the CD. Actually, the video ""God Must Have Spent a Little More Time on You"" was what got me interested in 'Nsync. Awesome song! The CD is never in its jewel case, its either in my CD player at home or in my computer at work. (That way I can watch the video during the day - shhh don't tell)"
2,The Funniest Song,This song makes me laugh. It reminds me of the funny relationships between teenagers.
2,A complete and total disappointment!,"It lists three tracks.....when it really only has the ALBUM VERSION of ""God Must Have Spent..."" and the live version of ""Sailing"".It has the MUCH SEEN ON MTV video for ""God Must Have Spent..."" on the enhanced version.It also has an interview....but owners of the offical video ""N The Mix w/ Nsync"" will recognize it!All the ""special,NEW"" footage is on that video.All that you REALLY get for your good six bucks is the ONE live song.That's all that's new on here.....for DEVOUT,INSANE, OBSESSIVE fans ONLY!It's not that I don't like NSync but this WAS NOT worth the money I paid for it!"
3,Not so bad,"The 2 tracked single comes with a nice little card, inside it read some lyrics to the song. It's ""signed"" (reprinted autographs) by the guys. Also, the CD is enhanced.. meaning, when you pop it in your CD-ROM, it will play a video (mostly *N THE MIX footage)."
5,This song is the best song ever written!!!,If you don't LOVE this sond then something is really wrong with you. This song is the prfect love song and touches my heart eeverytime i hear it. I love you Justin and *N Sync!!
5,My favorite NSYNC song,An awesome ballad. I listen to this song everyday. It's just a perferct song about anyone you love.
4,God Must Have Spent A Little More Time on You is cool!!,"I love NSYNC and I love the song God Must Have Spent....they are so hot, and they sing really really well."
5,THIS IS THE GREATEST *NSYNC SONG EVER!,I have to say that this is my all time fave *NSYNC song! The melody is just awesome and the words are just absolutely fantastic! It's a must for any fan.
5,Soulfully Soothing and Beautiful,"This single is a MUST HAVE!!! Not only does it have my two fave songs of all time, but it has an enhanced video on it. For those of you who are confused, the first track is JUST for your computer. Then the 2 and 3 will come up as 1 and 2. Get it? NSYNC is great and they are taking the world by storm, keep it up guys, we love you very much! Later Dayz!! PEACE AND HAIR GREASE!! STAY NSYNC!!!"
2,Disappointing,"I got this for practically nothing and I was STILL disappointed. The most watchable match was Morrison vs. Benjamin, tomorrow's next BIG stars. The rest was the same rehash...zzz"
5,Dont hesitate....BUY this bolt remover. It's money well spent.,"So I had the misfortune of having to replace my brakes and the brake lines recently, and things didn't go so well. I had not one, not two but three small 3/8"" bolts round off while trying to remove them. I spent two days trying to get them off, bought vise grips, filed the heads even heated the bolts, and of course sprayed about a can of PB blaster to help loosen. I did manage to get two off but the third wasn't going anywhere despite my determination. So I read online reviews of these bolt grip removers and I purchased a set. Upon arrival at my home I immediately got to work and in 3 SECONDS the stripped head was off. I honestly spent hours, way to many of them, trying in vain to remove the one rounded head off, and this tool did the job in seconds. I highly recommend this to you. It a must for any do it yourselfer."
4,Dang transmission filter bolts,"Well I went on a massive tool buying spree at my local uh Menards and decided I should get a bolt extractor kit. Well lo-and-behole I have to change the trans filter on my ole F250. Since the truck is 23 years old and subject to 23 years of harsh canadian winters all them filter bolts were nicely salted off. Now Im looking up at this lovely mess thinkin ""oh chicago!"" and think well lets try the Irwins out. Well I ll be danged! If they didnt grip what was left of those bolts and twist em out (all 16 of them). Now the only problem is they twisted the heads right clean off the bolts (well most of them anyway), but I did get that cover off. Now in all my infinite wisdom I tried to extract a larger bolt and used an air impact gun - word to the wise DONT use an impact gun.... I shredded all those flutes. Other than that its an excellent product"
5,Works great,"My husband stripped the bolts from his car and there was no getting them off...until this product. He popped this onto the now round bolt, it came off very easily!"
5,Great tool,love it just got in in the mail today and couldnt wait to try it out so i did and work like a charm also its cheaper then buying it in the store save a few bucks well worth the money for this tool
3,DAMAGE BOLT REMOVER,Damage bolt remover works ok i have not put it to a tuff or hard bolt to get out but it has worked very well for the bolts ihave used this tool on thank you for asking my opionDawn Garlick
2,Piece of Junk,"I bought this tool to remove the bolts from my transmission pan. I was able to remove some of the bolts but not all of them. The tool itself stripped while trying to remove one of the bolts. The helical blades, or whatever you want to call them, simply gave way. Very poor quality. I would gladly pay more for a tool that works."
3,Not bad but no where near the best...,"I am an avid Battletech fan and a diehard Blaine Lee Pardo reader, but this Mel Odum guy did not seem to enhance this book in any way or form. He seemed to mess with pefection,and he FAILED! I did like this book, but listen, Blaine, loose the Mel guy!"
4,A trip to the Periphery,I am of fan of Pardoe's work in the Battletech Universe and this one was no diffrent. Usually books about the Periphery do nothing but bore me but this was not the case for By Blood Betrayed. Good Story line and Background that ties the whole story together and right amount of action at the right time. Recommended Reading for the Battletech/Mechwarrior Universe. Good Book for someone just starting out in The Battletech/mechwarrior universe without having to know who other characters from past novels are.
2,average,A little to predictable a plot even for Battletech books. too much is given away by the title.
4,The Bottom Line,"Mel Odom and Blaine Lee Pardoe are an outstanding pair together. They help to bring alive words, it is almost as if you were right their watching everything happen. I do not normally like reading sci-fi, but this type of book I just could not put down. I had to keep reading to see what happend next. Great plot and just a great over all story."
4,Not bad at all...,"Actually, I had just read the previous book (by Pardoe), and found it pretty severely lacking. I was pleasantly surprised by (mos of) this one. Mel Odom's touch seemed to be a few early chapters where the characters were more developed than is typically found in these works. I enjoyed it greatly, and only wished other authors would follow in their footsteps and focused on weaving a REALISTIC world with REALISTIC characters... instead of cranking out page after page of ""man-powered lightning""... ""melting armor plates""...Oh, and have these people EVER played the (board)game? Nobody hits this much."
4,Lyrical and uplifting!,"With its stunning artwork and gentle words based on Native American folklore, How the Moon Regained Her Shape tells the story of the moon, and how she unwittingly angered the sun by dancing across his path. The sun's angry words upset the moon so badly that she ceases to travel her skypath.With the help of her friend the comet, and several other richly illustrated characters, the moon learns how important and loved she truly is. The moon slowly regains her self-confidence, and learns a valuable lesson in dealing with bullies.The phases of the moon are charted in the corner of each page, while at the back of the book is a section entitled ""Creative Minds."" Here you will find a variety of fun and educational activities including a chance to make a moon cycle circle, or to explore the Native American tribal names for each month's full moon.Armchair Interviews says: How the Moon Regained Her Shape is a lyrical and uplifting story to be shared with your 6 to 10 year old."
2,Nothing new,"I was looking for a book that offered instruction and cooking technique that could help take my cooking to the next level. What I got was just another cook book with more recipes for dishes I would not likely be interested in making. Many reecipes used ingredients that are seldom available. There are some good instructional books on the market like James Peterson's ""Sauces"" that offer great insights on cooking technique. This one fell considerably short of my expectations."
2,Pack Your Knives and Go,"I expected so much more from this book, especially after reading its description. It was very, very rudimentary, and quite frankly, the recommendations are common sense, i.e., use what is in season, use salt, etc. I was very underwhelmed by the book."
2,"Starts out wonderfully, then disapoints","This book starts out wonderfully, then disapoints. First let me say the book has wonderful photographs, easy to read type setting, and is a well designed book. Maybe you are like me, and find cookbooks frustrating when they go to an excess. The book's first two chapers go over in detail how to make wonderful sauces, and much more. Then the book begins to take a twist into more complex cooking. When I say complex I mean ingredients that are a bit harder to find, and recipes that are definately off the beaten path. I wish the book would have went over ways to do basic things, and how to improvise from that point. Instead it turns into very complex cooking. If you like stuff that is a beat off the beaten path this book is for you. I"
2,Think like a chef,"It was dissapointing.I expected a good cook book with great sauce reciepes.The show had many great sauces,with no showing ,what went in the sauces.He seems to be a great chef,but his book falls short."
3,"""It's done when it tastes right""","It's a good book, but not so much a cookbook. If you would like to be able to invent your own recipes, this book can teach you how.Read it for Colicchio's thoughts on the art (not science) of cooking. Go to your library, check it out; read it. If feel you need it on your bookshelf, buy it then. Otherwise, write down the parts that inspired you, then return the book.There are quite a few excellent points Colocchio makes, including the ""it's done when it tastes right"" approach to cooking. There are a few recipes that I'll keep, and I'll certainly take note of the techniques he deems important, such as sauce making and braising."
5,Belongs in every Cook's library.,"First, I like that Tom says to heat the oven, not preheat it. I know that sounds a bit Carlin, but to me, the distinction was enough to get me interested.The book is a great resource, informative and easy to navigate. The recipes that I have tried from the book have all turned out well and have helped me advance my cooking skills."
3,"Really, we should think 'wonderful food'","If you are a novice cook, the initial chapter techniques will help you get along.The recipes however are for the most part not your everyday choices. For instance, in the meat department cheeks, oxtails etc.Some of the author's guidance is elemental, some more advanced. It is an interesting read and Tom has great confidence in his presentation. Who can argue the success of his restaurant!Perhaps, I have been preparing food for too long, and have always been open to new challenges. I was not tempted to try any of the recipes in the book.There were a few guidelines that he did reinforce in my prep. This book is not for everyone.My son in law passed this book on to me. He is quite a cook or chef himself. He told me to continue to pass it on, not with much enthusiasm, but just pass it on. He would never let go of a cookbook he deemed valuable. He would only recommend or purchase another copy as a gift to be sure!"
4,No Pigeonholing Here,"Put this in your blender and shake it up -- uptempo bluegrass, Celtic fiddles and mandolins, accordions, consistently good writing, a little seduction, and a good measure of Christian imagery (the latter two actually get combined at least once in one of the best cuts, Mercy), even a little shot of ska. The result is After the Flood, over fifty minutes of music impossible to sit still to. 15 songs, three instrumentals, one of which -- Groove Set -- combines three traditional songs and flows without a pause out of the preceding cut, Everything's Okay. The Flood suite covers four or five cuts in the middle of the CD, but my highlights lie around it -- Better Me, Mercy, Miss You Much, Scarce, and Rest.Like me, you may not have heard of The Clumsy Lovers, but take the plunge into After the Flood. The rewards are instant and constant."
3,OK--BUT...,The book is good and informative but is a little outdated for current applications. If this is Haynes latest book then they really need to republish an updated version. But for older cars this is a good book
3,An Anatomy of Yawn,"It is difficult, at least for the ordinary history fun that want to know, BUT also get some good prose, to match the enthusiastic reviews this book has received with the hard reality of reading it. Conceding the fact that the author provides lot of information and many times destroy old prejudices and ideas about XVIII century british navy, it is also a fact that he does it with such a boring, linear, uneventful script and prose, that, beyond the realm of professional historians or history students preparing a thesis, the ""Wooden World"" becomes a stony one. It is a colorless, insipid book that demands extra effort to read it in its enterity. If not by the tons of information Mr. Rodger gathers, I would not give it more than one star, just because half a star is not available. History is no science, but a bit of science and lot of art. Every great historian has known that and Mr. Rodger should recall it."
5,"Beautiful, and instructive","I bought this book some years ago, and I have read it intermittently. I reread it this weekend, more carefully than before. It is a book that is beautifully designed and printed. Waite's teaching is given gently, partly by very good example and partly by suggestions and hints. His qualities of patience and persistence come over well.If you want to take good landscape photographs this book is well worth reading for ideas and examples."
2,Average,"Just an average book on landscape photography. Not much on technical aspects but lots of nice photos to look at. If you want to learn something about taking landscape photos, don't bother with this book."
4,One of the better landscape photography books,"Although much of the content in this book can be found in many other books on landscape photography, this book is better than most other such books. The images are very good, the writing is to the point, and the format and organization of the book make it easy to read and find information. It's worth a look."
5,Great book - beautiful and instructional as well,"This is one of the better books on photography that I have read. As one other reviewer wrote, one of my favorite things about the book is where Charlie makes recommendations about things that could have improved in the pictures...he suggests certain cropping that might help, or certain items that could have been left out of a picture to improve it. Equally helpful are the little touches that he mentions that really ""make"" a picture. He'll suggest covering up a small section of the picture with your hand, and he's right...without the highlight here or the rock there, the picture isn't as strong. It helped me think a little differently about the importance of seemingly minor things in the composition.One other small thing I like is that he includes not just the focal length of the lenses used in each picture, but also the types of filters used, shutter speed and aperture.I really enjoyed reading this book, and look forward to reading more of his others."
2,Not as Complete as Other Albums from the 2001 Tour,"These songs are from the 2001 All Starr Band tour. Good recordings, but the album, ""King Biscuit Flower Hour Presents Ringo and His New All-Starr Band"" has a more complete representation of that tour. The album ""Extended Versions"" is also from the same year, but with fewer songs. Why there are three different albums presenting the songs from that tour I don't know, but the King Biscuit one is the most complete. If you like Ringo and his All Starrs, go for the King Biscuit album and skip this one."
5,Back to medieval times,"The Kelmscott Chaucer is very famous because William Morris poured such meticulous craftsmanship on the production of the original book. Getting a chance to see one of the only 438 copies of the book isn't going to happen, but this reproduction is inexpensive and well worth acquiring. Morris included ALL the designs and letters used in the other books from his Kelmscott Press. The book includes all 87 of the woodcuts by Sir Edward Burne-Jones. The book is NOT the full text of the original Kelmscott Chaucer, but the book includes 111 slightly oversized pages. Calligraphers, graphic artists, and many other people would find this book fascinating."
2,Blah,"This book was only okay. I've read better books on the topic. I get what the author was trying to do with going through the virtues of the courtesans and giving examples, but it came off disjointed and felt like she was skipping all over the place. The ending just felt tacked on...""oh by the way, here's a list of what happened to everyone."" The authors writing style was not bad, she just needed better organizational skills. The book just did not flow well."
1,"Great subject, sloppy writing","Disorganized vapid prose and loads of wishful ""thinking"" - it's a gender feminist cream dream. Better you should read Proust for artistic insight on the topic, and look for a better written and more factual history."
3,Les Grandes Horizontales,"The subtitle of the book is ""a catalog of their virtues"". They are: Timing, Beauty, Cheek, Brilliance, Gaiety, Grace and Charm. The author tries to tie in these virtues with short biographies of, mostly French, cocottes of the 19th century. This simply does not work, no matter how much source material is dragged into the book. Besides, I have trouble describing Klondike Kate or Marlene Dietrich as courtesans. Besides, Ms. Griffin uses rather harsh and basic language, although she is given to occasional flights of lyrical fancy that can evoke a chuckle or two.Any courtesan having all of the required seven virtues would be Wonder Woman. And the main item missing here is CLASS."
2,overly pretentious writing,"Certainly the subject material is interesting. It's the writer's style that is lacking. It's like she is writing a thesis for university and has to increase the size of the paper and so she writes on and on. It's overly scholarly and analytical when the reader just wants the story/history of these courtesans. As others have said, I mostly skim-read it, skimming over the paragraphs to try to pull out the tidbits of interest."
1,More fiction than fact,"I barely made it 50 pages into this book. I found the topic fascinating, and have eagerly devoured other books which covered similar material, but this book is just insufferable. The author spends more time spooling out what MIGHT have happened than what DID happen, stringing together her flimsy imaginings of the courtesans' thoughts and motivations. Honestly, it reads more like real-person fan fiction than anything else. Not to mention, the prose is extremely pretentious and artificially flowery. Or, as the author herself might say, ""one might conclude, from the reading of this catalogue, that the words upon the page more closely resembled a vivid purple bruise than anything approaching an enjoyable book."""
3,"Neutral Rating, disappointed by format","Caveat Emptor -- this is a novel, not a graphic novel. The book is only graphically enhanced on the chapter separator pages. I was optimistic and disappointed, since I hate the idea of novel adaptations of comic or other kinds of sci-fi/movie/superhero characters. I hope I save some people the hassle of having to return a book they didn't want. Thanks!"
4,Almost Perfect,"My experience is with Jorgensen 3/4"" pipe clamps but when I saw the 4 for 3 pricing and free shipping I ordered 8 sets of these 3/4"" Irwin clamps. The Irwin 3/4"" pipe clamps fit on both threaded and unthreaded pipe, and they are a LOT easier to crank. Jorgensen requires threaded pipe on the head end. Jorgensen sells an aluminum base to hold the bar that doesn't work on the Irwin clamps because the back of the clamp part is higher than the Jorgensen base. Irwin shows the clamps sitting in slots cut into a table perpendicular to the bar in place of this but a non-woodworker must have come up with the idea because the part needs to be moved - can't if it's sitting in a slot. Of course the slot could be the entire length of the bar but then you'd have a table basically just for these clamps."
2,how hard is it to thred pipe,"I ordered six of these in 1/2"", not thinking about the clutch system. Well when I got them I was not too thrilled with the working end with the clutch but figured I'd give them a try. I think I used them a total of three times at work, what a pain! The head just spins because there is no threads to keep them from doing so. Gave them two stars because they are made well but just have a design flaw. Stick with the threaded, every home center sells threaded pipe, and if they don't its not too hard to have them threaded."
2,Quality Control,"I was really happy to see the new improved clamp design available from Irwin at a reasonable price. When I put the first one I had ordered together I could not figure where I had gone wrong, as the clamp did not sit flat on the bench top. I checked the product reviews online to find that the improper installation of the clutch plates is a pervasive issue. Very disappointing. Until I see that Irwin has addressed the issue I will look for alternative versions at Rockler.com as another user suggested, and continue using the Pony Clamps that are proven performers."
1,Amazon ;Just another big corporate name !,Are you joking? A 224134 Irwin clamp that sells for $9.50 with shipping of $7.00 each?What kind of corporate enticement is this by your company?Everyone else sells this piece for around $14.00 to 16.00 dollars with a reasonable shipping charge.Wake up Amazon!! I dont want to do business with this kind of corporate thinking !I am interested in many of these clamps. Appears I need to find a smaller company to do business with.
5,Great Innovation,What a great new innovation to a pipe clamp. I no longer have to have a threaded pipe with the IRWIN pipe clamps. The special clutch mechanism allows you to use an unthreaded pipe which will save you money and more importantly your time. This is one of those ideas that you say why didn't I think of that.
2,My pinion has changed !,"Well, since my first review I ordered ten more of these clamps and wow what a let down. As I expected reading the fine print on the back of the packaging revealed all the evidence I needed ""Made in China"". The clutch plates on the fixed assembly side were installed improperly on all clamps with the long tab pointing down, this would not allow the clamp to lay flat on its back causing them to lay over on their side. In addition to that problem some of the holes bored in the floating assembly were out of line causing the floating jaw to jam on the pipe and become difficult to tighten. Irwin should inspect their products more closely especially when they are charging more than the American made Pony clamps."
2,Clamps leave a lot to be desired,"I purchased five of these clamps expecting the non-threaded attachments would be a great thing. I had two disappointments. First, the lack of threads allow the clamp to twist on the pipe. It is hard to get them tight without using both hands. Secondly, and the most disappointing, is that the movable part of the clamp that should slide up and down the pipe to tighten on the work binds on the pipe more often than not and prevents you from getting good pressure on the item being clamped. I tried wire brushing the pipes thinking that they had rough spots on them but it did not help the situation."
3,HRM review,This review is for the book we are using in HRM class at HLG. I think that this is a solid book for HRM class. I do think that the chapters are a little long and the book needs some more color. Our teacher used alot of seperate handouts with this book. Some being comics or little cartoons that went along with HRM issues. I enjoyed them and I think this could be a good way to spice up the book. The many charts throughout the book gave much insight and were helpful at times to show what was really going on more than if it was written.
3,Hard to read,"Human Resource Management: An Experiential Approach (2nd Edition) by John Bernardin and Joyce Russell is the textbook used in my MAN 433 Human Resource Management class at Hannibal-LaGrange College. It has very good content. Unfortuneately, it is not presented in the best fashion. There are many charts and examples, but there is not a picture or spot of color to be found in the entire book. The chapters are also extremely long. It is hard to stay focused on what is being read."
3,Human Resource Management,"I am using this book for my Human Resource Mangement class at Hannibal-LaGrange College. This book is very basic. It has good content and in-depth discussions of legal issues. The content covers all human resource topics. The objectives are at the beginning of each chapter to help outline the contents. It is written mostly in clear and understandable style. But, most chapters are very wordy and hard to maintain the readers attention. There is no color, graphs or charts to help keep the readers focused . The chapters are repititious and boring. This book is difficult to read and hard to get through each chapter. I would recommend this book for the contents only."
4,it is ok!,"The book looks just like the book borrow from senior students.The pen marks are everywhere, but ok to me.It just similar with the newest edition. But a lot cheaper.shipping did take a long time. but it arrive before the estimate date."
3,Human Resource Management,"This textbook is well explained in theories, cases, and examples for future HRM managers. However, the lack of any contrast in colors makes the material hard to get through. Even the figures that in most textbooks are left to stand out, blend to the written text. All the information is excellent, it's just a stain on the eyes to read."
4,Comprehensive discussion on legal defensibility,"This book is difficult reading, but it has some of the most in depth discussion of legal defensibility and validity of performance appraisals and hiring practices."
2,wordy,I am a management major and am taking Human Resources Management currently. I thought that this book is rather wordy and hard to get through. It seems to have too many references to company's throughout it's discussion of major concepts that make it almost unbearable to read. The book seems repititious and basically boring.
5,Great for a starter,This driver is very forgiving and therefore very useful for a new golfer. Improves confidence.
1,Just Terrible!!!!,"First of all, i bought this driver for $24.99 and it sucked sinced the day i bought it. well, the first one I purchased got a dent in the back of the club. So, I exchanged it and got another one. It held up for three months and the performance was good but I'm a rookie golfer anyway! I took it out for a short 9-holes and the damn club head broke off completely on the first hole!! That was terrible, but you get what you pay for and i would not reccomend this club to anyone!!"
2,Looks cool,"this driver actually seemed to make things worse when I used it, I went back to my old driver and am doing better (back to where I was before this driver)"
4,yummaroo...,"This was great! Well, I didn't exactly follow the cooking directions, but rather made it on the stovetop and added some of my own fresh vegetables and more water (it would have been too salty)... But for a really good soup/chili starter, it was excellent. And both the beans and veggie beef held up with good texture and taste too. A really satisfying meal."
3,Interesting but Disjointed and Hard to Follow at Times,"The author has spent many years in Africa, the Balkans and other locales in the company of mercenaries and so many of the chapters are first person stories of going on helicopter combat missions, wandering through hostile towns and countryside or sitting in on mercs recounting war stories. Other chapters however are comprised of the author's recounting of some past operations of which he was not present and so he relies on other sources. The trouble is, these chapters are rather intermixed and at times the author repeats something he has already told us or he just assumes we remember some associated information from a couple of hundred pages back. The resulting jumble is frustrating at times and is certainly more trouble than the casual reader would want to attempt. Really only recommended to those who are willing to tolerate the faults while looking for the gems, of which to be sure there are many."
3,Tough read,"The subject and content are good, but the writing is terrible. This book does not flow and is tough to read at times. Using spell check would have helped also."
4,Hind's First hand,"I'm a ""Hind-Nut"" or a HUGE fan of the MI_24 Helicopter and all it's variants. (old & New) I get every book and read every thing on line I possibly can about this flying battle ship.The only problem is that most all books on the hind are Technical manuals, discriptions and Histories of it, there is little or nothing written about actual combat in the hind. Not true anymore! The Authors stories of Neil Ellis' battles are very exciting and will be to any Hind Enthusiest.I knew little or nothing about the Bush wars in Africa (or even where Sieara Lione was)until I read this book and got a real education from it as well. NOT a light read though."
5,Excellent,Why the former colonies in Africa are failed states.can be attributed to the failure of uN peace keepers to act appropriately often these dogs of war are used to exploit resources in former colonies of European powers.
1,Cheese slicer doesn't cut the mustard,"I wouldn't buy this product again or recommend it to others. The marble surface had a crack. When I washed it, a chunk fell out, revealing putty that had been used to hold it together. In other words, the company knowingly sold a defective product."
2,it is ok,i bought this for my husband who loves cheese he used it a couple of times and it ended up breaking the lats time. it had a spare wire and that broke too. i wouldn't suggest buying this product if you plan on actually using it.
2,not so good,the thought is good but quality is not...thing broke in second day odf use and the replacement string broke a week l;ater then the little foot fell off... would not reccommend
5,Terrific Item,"This is an amazing little countertop item that we use constantly. It slices your cheese to any thickness you desire, cleanly and neatly. Clean-up is easy. We've had no problems with it at all and plan on giving as gifts this Christmas."
5,Daniela's True Color and Vocal Strength puts her at the TOP!,"I have all of her CD's and this one is by far her best! She should be here in the US on Tour promoting her unique style of Brazilian music, she is electrifying, and very energetic on stage! Please buy this CD and you will see why Daniela has sold millions of copies worldwide, (except in the US)."
5,PERFECT,"What a great artist and album! I first heard her music 5 yrs ago through a friend in Brazil and fell in love with it. Feijao com arroz is by far her best one yet. Best songs have to be Nobre Vagabundo, Feijao de Corda, Minas com Bahia and Bate Couro. Buy it NOW!"
4,LUIS ENRIQUE PRESENTA EXCELENTE DISCO DE BALADAS.,"POR VEZ PRIMERA EL ""PRICIPE DE LA SALSA"" GRABA UN DISCO COMPLETAMENTE DE BALADAS. ESTE TRABAJO PARA SONY LATIN ES DE UNA CALIDAD INCREIBLE. LUIS ENRIQUE DESMUESTRA EN SU DISCO ""GENESIS"" QUE NO SOLAMENTE ES UN SALSERO SINO QUE TIENE VOZ PARA CANTAR TODO TIPO DE MUSICA. LOS MEJORES TEMAS DE DISCO LO SON ""COMO VOY A OLVIDARTE"", ""POR TU AMOR"" Y ""MALA SUERTE"". PERO SIN DUDA ALGUNA EL MEJOR TEMA LO ES ""AL SON DEL AMOR"".TAMBIEN RECOMIENDO LOS SIGUIENTES CD'S: ""EVOLUCION"" DE LUIS ENRIQUE, ""COMPLETAMENTE TUYA"" DE LAZZ, ""PASIONAL"" DE JESSICA CRISTINA Y ""SUBEME EL VOLUMEN"" DE MICHAEL STUART."
1,What a rip-off!,"What was billed as a step-by-step breakdown of Black Sabbath's guitar styles and techniques is little more than anyone could pick up in an afternoon just by listening to the record. I bought the DvD for two songs - The Wizard and Wicked World - thinking that I would ""learn the trademark riffs and SOLOS"", as stated on the back. I thought maybe I could see some of the fingering Iommi does on some of his wilder sounding riffs and solos.Well, for The Wizard, all you get is the opening chord riff and the verse. None of the breaks, no solos, nothing. I learned those parts back when I was 15 and barely able to play at all. For Wicked Word, a little more than that is offered. Anything involving REAL chops is not shown. I am wondering if Danny Gill can really play. What a waste of $18!"
5,The Letters of Abelard and Heloise,"It's always best to get hold of what was actually written or said, if at all possible. This book is as close to original as can be had. It is a fascinating book because its many letters reveal, at least a little, why some people do potentially harmful things to themselves and perhaps others. At the same time it refreshingly demonstrates that, in the end, people have been doing the same things for just about as long as, well, people have been around!"
5,Excellent Service,"I ordered this book just 3 days before my classes were to start, and I actually received it on time! The book came new and at a much better price than the college bookstore by far. The book was packaged well for shipping and arrived in mint condition. I am very pleased with my purchase in every way!"
5,"Parkway Drive, where have you been all my life?","I saw these guys on Warped Tour last week. There was a TON of buzz about em, but I had never heard their music. They lived up to all the hype and then some. I bought this CD at the show.It's an amazing album! I only wish I knew of it sooner. Their lead guitarist is absolutely awesome! There are plenty of heavy parts & breakdowns. If you like bands like As I Lay Dying and Unearth, you'll love these guys. Plus, Adam D. from Killswitch Engage produced this album, and pretty much every CD he works on is great. My favorite tracks are ""Romance is Dead,"" ""Mutiny,"" ""Picture Perfect, Pathetic,"" & ""Smoke Em if You Got Em.""Parkway Drive also has a new CD coming out Oct. 9, 2007. Run, don't walk, to go get it."
5,The best Austrailian band. Period.,"First off, this band is NOT American. They are from Austrailia and are very good friends of I Killed The Prom Queen. I first heard the song Mutiny on their Myspace, and was blown away. After I got the cd and found out Adam from Killswitch produced their cd, I knew the rest of it would be good. If you love great melodic metal-core, and you're tired of a lot of ""trendy"" bands, and you want something different, get this. Every song is amazing and it's one of the few cds I never skip a track on."
5,Excellent! Many photos and descriptions!,"This book shows many pictures that are very detailed. I suggest to anybody to buy this book, because you yourself could set a Guinness record one day!"
3,Defiantly decent,Dramatic but not emphatic nor epic release seems to be reaching for something I just can't find much of; melodic maturity.
2,Uninspired and Boring,"Im a fan of the whole post-rock, instrumental thing, but this band loses me in their boring, uninspired, generally lack-luster music. Its sort of a post-rock trait that the music has to be brooding. This band takes that to a nauseating level. I can think of several other bands that manage to inspire and really make the music enjoyable. Definitely not recommended."
2,I agree!!!,I got this cd because i read one of the 4 star reveiws now ive got a cd i will never listen too!! THANK YOU
5,The Great Leap Forward,"Very atmospheric music, setting you in places only they, the band, could have thought of. Every song has its own sound, and every sound it resonates puts me through incredible states of emotion and nostalgia. The quiet plucking of the guitar has never sounded so beautiful, so well executed. Their best."
3,good game but,This game is a lot of fun. Combines puzzles and a little strategy. Does not run under windows XP or win 7 even if you change the settings
2,Not for opeative porpuses,"Some good comments in C-Suite roles and general purposes for the COO, kind of high level outside point of view, not to develop a job description or specific information. It seams a little expensive for what you get."
3,Solid Collection for Completists,"Like the first two in the series, a solid roundup of northern soul/r&b; of the 1960's (not including Motown or Philly) of course. The quality drops slightly so this one is really just for completists.Like the CD cover, it's professional but not overly exciting nor was all that much creative effort expended in putting these tracks together. It's good, just not great.(for great - check out Zealous Records Presents Soul Sides)"
4,Helping Not Hurting,"What can i say? Truly amazin. My roommate, Brian was skeptical of Helping, Not Hurting at first. My how times have changed for him as a result. He recently introduced Helping Not Hurting to his wife, and she loved it! Thank you so much for letting me express my story!"
5,GAME4USUCKAZ,"IF YOU KNOW FAIRFIELD U KNOW THERE AINT NOTHIN LIKE FLATLANDS FUNK-LIL JAZZ GOT SAUCY FLOWZ,DOPE BEATS & CREATIVITY UNLIKE MANY...BE SURE TO PEEP PIZZO-HEATERMAN,SKIP DOG,EZSD,B.O.M.,FREAKY FRED,FLAWLESS,THE PERK,YOUNG PLAYA JU & J-DOGG 4 MORE FUNK"
4,This Soundtrack is amazing!!,"I love this soundtrack almost as much as I loved the movie! The only thing that I would have liked better on the soundtrack is some Jennifer Lopez songs, but other than that, it is wonderful! GO buy it, and see the movie!"
3,Not a western...,"This particular Silvertip novel of Max Brand's is actually a metaphorical fantasy. The horses talk and philosophize about Man. If you are expecting an action-packed, rip-roaring western novel, a reader needs to select another book. If a reader is looking to appreciate Brand's talented method of analyzing Man and his idiosyncrasies, then this paperback will fill that quest."
4,Enter the enchanting world of Filoli,"After visiting the delightful Filoli, filled with glorious gardens exhibiting exquisite fauna and flora, I was inspired to try to capture the beauty, via camera. I failed miserably, and did not do justice at all to the picturesque landscape of Filoli. - Luckily Christopher McMahon was able to, in this lovely coffee table book. Each page is filled with color photographs of different areas of the garden, throughout different seasons.A definite must for anyone that wants to take home a little of the beauty that is known simply as 'Filoli'."
3,Accounting,It makes the subject matter more complicated than need be as it garbles the information. There are better entry level accounting books available.
4,If you are a true fan,"This CD isn't Veruca Salts best EP album all put together as one, but it has some of the bands best songs ever. ""officially Dead"" is a reminder of what we were left with, with 2000's ""RESOLVER"". Straightjacket is a fast paced, easy to learn the words to and fun to sing along to rollick. ""Blissfull queen"" is toned down a bit from the previous but speeds up soon after it's eerie introduction and maked for a beautiful and memorable track. ""the light behind your eyes"" is a pretty song with very thin instrumentation. Louise's voice sounds very whispery in this song. And the final track ""the same person"" which is a remix of a song on the ""resolver"" cd is a slow and drawn out dreamlike gem that will easily put any drowsy listener to sleep in no time. This CD is worth the money if you are a true VS fan. If you can't wait for their new CD and you want to hear there new sound this Cd is for you."
2,OK,"I think that this CD wasnt the BEST from them. But out of all the Cd's i highly sujest ""Volcano Girls"". Its a clasic rock song!"
2,A Checklist of Robert A. Heinlein,"This is neither a book, nor an essay nor annotated bibliography. It seems to be a complete listing of Heinlien's works in 47 pages. It is divided into Books with 54 entries and short stories with 121 more. It has a title index. Contains great detail on various editions and features. It seems accurate and complete. I have not checked. It would have been wonderful to have had a listing of the works using Heinlein's Future History chronology. At least a few introductory sentences could have been written. It is an immensely useful tool for the serious collector."
4,Interesting period cookbook,"My husband spoke of his mother's copy of this cookbook often so I bought copies for all the ""kids"". It is an interesting book written for women new to the workforce. Chores are orchestrated so that the entire meal comes together at the same time - quantities are gauged with leftovers in mind for reuse later in the week. Some of the ingredients were better known during the depression era when nothing went to waste. There are a few recipes that I admit made me.. erm.. well... they basically killed my appetite. But I mean that in a fun way - NO WAY would Mother EVER go out with us for sushi. I look forward to the day when I can sit down with my grandkids and plan meals like their great-grandma ate when she moved to the big city and worked in a factory."
5,Great C.D.,This is a great summertime cd. Suger Ray can rock out and slow it down.Put this one in the player and just just drive!
4,Missing a great song,"One of my favorite songs of all time is a Sugar Ray song, albeit it's a remake. The song got rave reviews but little air play. It's called ""Spinning Away"" and I found it on The Beach soundtrack. Have a listen. It reminds me the great time I had backpacking around the world."
1,greatest hitS ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?,"these guys having a greatest hits album is almost as hysterical as milli vanilli having one. (...) talk about a short shelf life (...) these fadfreaks,the wallflowers,matchbox 20,hootie and the theyblow fish,groups no one will miss.good riddence (...)"
5,"Catchy, fun songs!!","I wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who is even a halfway big Sugar Ray fan! Of course, all of the hits that were played on the radio are on here, as well as some other songs that are catchy and fun. The band is awesome and so is this CD! Get it!"
4,I Just Want to Fly...,Great reminder of my early teens. I forgot half of the songs on here were even performed by Sugar Ray.
5,Great album,This is one of my fav's. It has all their best songs and I like to listen to it all the time. Highly recommend!
4,hooRAY for sugar RAY YAY!!!,listeninjg to sugar ray is one of the best things that ever happened to mankind i like to think of them as the ace of base of the late 90's no one has a greed with me so far but who cares??!! that is just what i think!!!! anyways this collection of songs will save you the trouble of buying all of their albums unless you need to have the cover art and pictures of the band becauise they are all nice looking guys who could teech you alot about what to wear and hoiw to style your hair and make girls really like to be around you and remember your name. my favorite song is the fly song because it always gets the ladies dancing because its a good dancing song especially for ladies who like to dance. if you like sugar ray as more than a friend like my brother who has lots of posters of mark mcgrath in his closet you will porbably like this cd alot and keep it in your cd player for a long timwe until your ready to listen to something else.
5,love this cd,"I went to see Sugar Ray at a free concert recently in St. Paul, MN, and it was so much fun. I'd have paid to see it, but a FREE one, how great is that? Anyway, that's why I went out and bought this CD, and I love it. It's easily my favorite one right now. My other CDs are boring in comparison. It has all the songs I expected it to have, plus a few I didn't know Sugar Ray recorded. As much as I like Fly, Every Morning, etc. my favorite track is, Is She Really Going Out With Him? I listened to it 3 times in a row the first time I listened to the CD. I can't remember the last time a song appealed to me so much!! I think anyone who likes Sugar Ray will like this CD."
4,Good cd,"This is a good cd. Sound is good, most songs are also good. I am pleased with this cd. Price was good and deliivery was quick."
3,Interesting!!!,"The Fact That The Songs On This CD Are ""Remakes"" Is Never Mentioned In The Item Description And That Can Be Misleading. While They Are Remakes The Original Artist Is Involved In The Project Giving It An Authentic Feel.I Was Initially Disappointed But After Listening A Few Times The Newer Versions (Especially ""Baby Come Back"") Grew On Me.The Material Is A Bit Too Modern (By Using Sampling) But Interesting Enough To Keep."
3,Misleading Description,"As other reviewers have stated (should've looked before I leaped) this is not the original recordings. It's a re-recording by the original artist. It's not bad, but I was looking for the original."
1,sucks!!!,"this is not at all what i purchased, it does not have the original version of the song anywhere on this cd. thanks for nothing"
4,"Buy this one, it's really good!","""Ultimate Collection"" is the only album on the market where you can get a full dose of Angela Winbush's sweet, soulful melodies from the 1980s up to her latest original work with The Isley Brothers in 1996. There isn't a bad song on this album, and rightfully it should have contained a few more songs, like ""Imaginary Playmates"" from her Rene & Angela days, but I digress.If you like this one, I suggest that you get the Rene & Angela album, ""A Street Called Desire...and More,"" which has a much better version of ""You Don't Have To Cry"" than you get in this set, plus excellent 12"" versions of ""Save Your Love (For #1),"" ""I'll Be Good,"" and ""Your Smile."" Another good choice is the album ""Sharp,"" wich has some other gems like ""You Had A Good Girl."""
3,"Nice Angela Sampler, but....","There is NO DOUBT that Winbush is a GREAT talent, but this CD should've been a total showcase for her SOLO work!! While the tracklisting is diverse, the Rene & Angela songs could've been left off!! They are impressive songs, BUT REAL Angela Winbush fans already own the 'Best Of Rene & Angela' & 'Street Called Desire' CDs, so there is unnecessary song repetition on this NEW compilation. Also, the song 'Cest Toi (It's You)', should've been left off. The track is an annoying uptempo number which showcases a few French words that Winbush learned!! Angela's rendition of 'Inner City Blues' (Make Me Wanna Holler) is a fine remake, but I would've liked to see the AWESOME 'To Good To Let Go' or 'Keep Turnin Me On' in it's place!! If you REALLY love Angela Winbush, get all 3 of her solo CDs PLUS the 2 Rene & Angela compilations. This way, you can really appreciate Angela's gifts. This CD is for novice Winbush followers, NOT FOR THE REAL FANS!!Peace, SD (of 'Chaka's World')"
4,Spectacular,"I have most of these songs in album format, but wanted a CD version. These songs are classic to me...great listening"
3,"may 11, 2008","this is a very good cd, although there are a few songs that were missing from the collection, the main songs were on the cd and sounded great"
4,Sweet sounds,I always wanted to have all of Angela's music at my fingertips and with this cd all you do is press play and you have wonderful music with each and every track. You find yourself holding a remote and singing away
5,AWESOME!!!!,This CD brought me back. The compilation of songs from Angela Winbush are incredible. The duets with Ron Isley are so romantic. A Must have in anyone's CD collection.
2,There was some growth...,"While there was growth from Ground Zero, Bonnie still needs to work on plot. The plot should be a natural progression of events leading to a conclusion (puzzle pieces make the entire puzzle) and should not be forced (force the pieces together and I bet the picture doesn't look like the one on the box!). The opening event (a shooting) is interesting, but it has nothing to do with the real storyline (earthquake games)! It is only placed there as a convenient way to develop a character and solve internal character conflicts; this conflict would have been better served by more strongly SHOWING the character's actions and not using a psychiatrist to allow the conflict to be TOLD. These stories have wonderful technological concepts and as long as she keeps growing as a writer (and gets over her fixations with food and coffee), I will continue to buy her books."
1,"Would love to read this, but...","Not at this price. Nearly $30??? for a Kindle book??? I've had a dulcimer for about 15 years and enjoy reading about them and their history, but I am sorry, I have to pass this one up!"
4,The Happy Room,This book is an honest reminder of how serving God should not become an excuse to be an absentee parent. Looks at some hard issues.
3,The Happy Room,"I found this book to be disturbing and depressing. If you like a lot of dialogue, you'll LOVE this book. If you had a happy childhood in a loving family, you'll be surprised by the scars some people carry into adulthood. If you had a not so happychildhood in a not so loving family, you'll dredge up a lot of memories you would rather leave buried. Truth is, no matter how hard parents try to do what is best for their children, the kids rarely think they ""measured up"" as parents. Sad situation on all sides. I didn't feel better after reading this book! AM in Texas"
2,Poor recording.,"While I'm sure this performance was very pleasing, the recording for it is just horrid. There is a constant grainy sound throughout the whole CD, and because of some error on the final cut sounds way to harsh. I would suggest the Antoni Wit with the Polish National Radio Symphony Orchestra instead."
2,"Great Performance, Bad Recording.","I was glad to see at least one other person heard this too so I know it's not my equipment that's faulty. The performance was fantastic, but whoever the recording engineer was totally biffed it. Every time the orchestra got loud there was an awful grainy clipping. It's sad really cuz the orchestra nailed it. I'm going to have to get a different recording, because the recording is not of professional quality. I honestly don't know how it got past the mastering stage."
5,"""This is a book about feeling good.""","On the back cover of this book it says, 'This is a book about feeling good.' I couldn't agree more. As my first child approached the time to begin solid foods, I began researching nutrition and healthy foods. There is so much conflicting and confusing information out there. It got to the point where one night while grocery shopping I was almost in tears after spending almost two hours reading labels and still feeling lost about what to feed my family.This book is extremely informative without being 'over your head'. I see it as a sort of 'Nutrition 101', in the sense that it is general enough to cover everything but specific enough to be the only book on nutrition you'll need. I really feel empowered and in control now, capable of feeding my family well. I originally rented this book from the library, but it was so informative I am going to buy it."
2,Somewhat disappointing,"I think the Sears family has reached the end of their expertise and should stop issuing new books on every aspect of parenting. This one seems like they are fulfilling a contractual obligation to their publisher. They are WAY too demanding about what you feed your child and don't seem to realize most of us don't have lots of money and help in the kitchen to achieve all the perfect meals they demand. The book was discouraging and unrealistic.I found that a much more useful book is Feeding Your Child for Lifelong Health by Drs. Susan Roberts and M.B. Heyman. This book was written by doctors who specialize in child nutrition and who have scrutinized the literature on nutrients, metabolism, food allergies, etc. Yet the book is realistic and helpful, not guilt inducing like Dr. Sears."
4,Excellent -- but watch the fish recommendations,"An excellent book with one exception -- it heartily recommends regular fish consumption, but fails to mention the problem of methyl mercury and/or PCB contamination in several commonly consumed species of fish. Look for the Environmental Working Group's recommendations on this subject."
2,Game Time,This game has complicated rules and is not a fast moving game. I bought it for game night with the in-laws. We were all a little confused by the instructions and had to improvise and make our own rules to make it work...
2,Dont By It!,"Well I saw this in stores one day and wondered what it was.Although the dvd is just the same as 10 Years Of Thomas.The only thing different is the sounds.On the front of the cover are little stickers you press.Each one makes a certain sound.If you Have 10 Years of Thomas,dont buy it!"
1,There's much better,"A scattered, spacey, self-indulgent book full of irrelevant information. For a well-written, grounded, and inspiring overview of the Hemi-Sync path, Bruce Moen has written a series of superb books."
1,Save your money,"I was extremely disappointed with this book. I was expecting a comprehensive ""how-to"" guide on how to get the best from Hemi-Sync, but instead was bombared with buzzwords like wormholes, tachyons, ""The Force"", etc which leave you wondering whether the author has completely lost the plot. Leva states that you should use the ""right grade of energy"", and her sole advice on how to do this is to read someone else's book! There is a completely irrelevant chapter on the history of Star Trek, plus the book is padded with lots of emails between Hemi-Sync fans which are interesting, but should probably be left on a newsgroup server or web site rather than filling out the book.There are some descriptions of the TMI work, but nothing I haven't read elsewhere. If you are interested in the work of TMI then Bruce Moen's books are a lot more readable."
3,Good dscription of TMI's hemisync,"Patricia includes very good descriptions of the process of Hemi-Sync being taught at the Monroe Institute. Patricia herself is/was a teacher at TMI. Patricia seems very 'New Age' oriented and for some reason feels to need to provide analogous scientific support for mental structures and tools used at TMI. Examples are the ""Einstein-Rosen bridge"", the ""wormhole"" from Star Trek, a dimensional portal from the Sci-Fi show ""Sliders"". She also includes her personal philosphy in chapter 3 that just left me saying ""What the heck?"""
2,Not impressed,i ordered this for my brother for christmas and it took a very long time to ship. Then on the day it was supposed to arrive the seller emailed me and told me that it had been lost. now onto the product it self. it looks nice and all but it is very tiny and looks like its worth like $5. Buyer Beware.
5,If you like Catan...then this will be AWESOM,"This is an add on, you can not play this game without regular settlers. It atkes a game or two to figure this out. But the movement from settlers to Cities and knights is mind blowing. It changes the game entirely do I build and hope to freeload from another players armies or do I protect myself...a great dilemma. Great way to teach kids about how the US govt is the world's babysitter. You get cards like arsonist where you can destroy opponets unprotected cities...so there is always a squabble."
5,Excellent expansion,This expansion is an excellent addition to the original Settlers game-we enjoy playing the game even more now. The new progress cards and commodity cards add a new level of playing that increase the difficulty and strategy making game play more involved and fun.
2,Preferred the basic game,"The Knights expansion really hoses the player who is furthest behind (the barbarians always trash their city) and it makes mountain squares much more valuable than previously. We may experiment with some house rules, but as is it lengthened the game a lot for very little addition to the fun. The expansion may even make play more random, which Catan really doesn't need."
4,Pretty but tough,"I was a bit worried when I noticed that some of the other Irwin C-clamps were getting low ratings. But so far I have had nothing but good luck with these clamps. So far they have not distorted and have stayed true and square. The twin thread design is supposed to help clamp things tighter. I have not noticed much improvement, but maybe that is because I am comparing them to 8"" clamps of the same throat clearance and not 3"" clamps. And some people complained about slow adjusting on the threads. Maybe on bigger C-clamps but on this size I do not notice them being any slower than an Adjustable brand clamp. When you look at this clamp it looks beefy for its size and the color is nice to look at compared to bare steel of other clamps. So far I have only had satisfactory results."
4,good size but head clearance a problem,I needed some deep C clamps and bought two of these for use on a drill press in the shop. What I did not realize until I used them for the first time is that the clamping section is very tall and can get in the way. I have switched to the Bessey deep C-clamps where the clamping section only sticks up 1/3 as much.Bessey CM34DR 3-Inch x 4-1/2-Inch Malleable Deep Reach C ClampThe Irwin are well made and the course threading makes changing the clamp very quick. The threads also appear to be plated but I am still making use of WD-40 to prevent rusting. WD-40 is one of those taxpayer funded products (for the US Navy) that still is the best product available at any price for removing and preventing rust.
4,The previous reviewer got it wrong !,"I don't know which book the previous reviewer was referring to. This is a physics book, by one of the leading physicists of this century."
1,WARNING: Does NOT support 1080p,"We purchased this module as a plug-in for our Panasonic High Def Plasma Display, a Professional series 1080p display. After numerous calls to Panasonic Support to find out why we couldn't use the 1080p output from our DVD player, we returned it when Oppo (our DVD manufacturer) told us that the HDMI module didn't support 1080p. What good is an HMI board that doesn't support 1080p in a 1080p display? And what good is Panasonic support when they don't even know their own product line? Save your money; if you have the TH-50PF9UK, use an HDMI-DVI cable."
3,Is it really better than Component for HD channels?,"I purchased this for my professional series monitor. Not much to say about it, picture looks fine. I needed an HDMI port to upconvert my DVDs. Clearly the picture of the upconverted DVD looks better but when I plug in the HD cable I don't see much of a difference. Ask yourself this question...is it worth $130 for that. If you're only using it for regular dvds or cable then the 20/20 hindsight answer would be no."
4,Should have had 2 or more inputs,"This blade works perfectly and i have not had any problems with it over the last 4 years. I do think it should have come with 2 or more inputs on the single blade though. The newer models of the blade do have 2 inputs, but are only compatible with series 9 and up i believe."
3,Tractor Review,"The person that gave this five stars said Tractor Operator was one of his dear friends, that's a bit like voting for your mother isn't it? Anyway the bottom line is this isn't very good."
3,"Brave but too much ""Me""","Wish that there had been more mentioned of relationship with daughter Lillian. Mothers of children with mental illness needed that and this book could have helped fill that gap. Know Swanee Hunt's name and story will continue to be seen in connections with worthwhile projects and the political scene. Her son encourages her to run for US President and she would be qualified, no doubt about it. Professor and diplomat seem more valuable in terms of Giving. Her growth through mentors speaks volumes for strong people taking time to be mentors for all ages. One can only hope that this book does not become another Giant movie. There has been too much gossip and misunderstanding of a family that deserves privacy and respect."
4,KitchenAid pouring shield,Shield works great. No more splashing contents around the counter. Also helps to pour dry ingredients easier.
1,THE WORST MOVIE EVER!!!!!,"This movie is terrible!!! If it were possible, I would give this movie no stars at all. It's an extremely low-budget sci-fi movie. The thin plot is about a prison in space that gets taken over by its prisoners. One of the prisoners who accidentally ended up in the wrong prison, and the only remaining security guard, team up in order to escape. Everything about this movie is bad. The acting, direction, action, plot, and everything else I can possibly think of is just plain horrible. I taped this off of television for free, and I still felt [....] There is no reason to see this film at all. I truly think it is the worst movie that was ever made."
2,TIMELOCK WHAT???,"OK, I read the reviews and still bought this movie...Maryam D'abo is starting to show her age in this low budget Sci-fi Non-thriller. I had remembered seeing this movie somewhere but mainly bought it because I liked D'abo in some other flicks.The best parts of the movie are the moments of 20th century comic relief provided by Ayre Gross (a Cyber thief sent to the wrong prison). Not much more I can say except wait to see it on [tv].P.S. What the title of the movie has to do WITH the movie I am still trying to figure out(maybe I snoozed thru that part).Happy viewing................"
3,Pretty good..but also a bit disappointing....,"I just hope Liz had checked 'NO' 'cause Sweet Valley just won't be same with her in Denver!!!!I always have thought she was kind of a bore, but that doesn't mean she is not my fave twin.....The reason I gave 3 stars is 'cause I don't like Scott or Tom Watts!!!Scott Slimeball- as Tom put him, I don't think he is kind of person Liz will go out with......I think it's just because her terrible break-up with Tom had caused her to do uncharacteristic things and that is why she is going out with Scott...(I think..)But anyway,I recommend this book to you, but when you read it over and over again it could easily get you to SLEEP!!!"
2,Okay Movie,"The movie was okay. Not really scarry, just a little bit of blood. What I watched was fine, but it wasn't good enough to keep me awake, and I slept through the ending."
1,Carny (2010),"I'm generally a fan of horror movies and Lou Diamond Phillips. Hard to find any redeeming qualities to this movie, however. The price was right but everything else about it was wrong. Low budget and even lower final product. Come on Lou, you're better than this."
3,This is NOT the 1970's film with Jodie Foster,"This is some new film with Lou Diamond Phillips which I am unfamiliar with. I wanted to correct the last review left here, so you wouldn't order something you didn't want. I couldn't leave this comment without putting in a star rating, so I gave it a middle ""3,"" not having seen it."
5,Carny,"definitely one of the top 5 films put out by syfy channel. Really good, bearing in mind you like cheesy monster films to begin with!"
4,Primal Branding - Patrick Hanlon,"I have spent quite a bit of time lately explaining to our clients the importance of story telling. Create a great story, and you will be able to create great zealots for your brand. That is the essence of this book. As the author states early on, ""The creation story is the crucial first step in providing answers to why people should care about you, or your product or service.""The book, like many other books on branding, reiterates a lot of common sense theories that cause the reader to say, ""Well of course, that makes sense."" That's okay! It is worth being reminded once in awhile why the basics work. That being said, this book does utilize current brand examples that help prove the theories correct. This is a book that I would recommend if you were looking for a good basic book on branding in theory and practice. It's worth the money."
4,Definitely worth the time to read,"Branding isn't that easy, so I feel that anyone trying to boil it down to seven ways to nirvana is a bit simplistic. But Hanlon's seven elements of primal branding make a ton a sense. The emphasis on the creation story is a helpful reminder that brands derive strength from people knowing where they come from and why they exist. While I think it could have made these points in fewer pages, I would definitely recommend this book"
2,Confusing,This book was very hard to read. He uses a lot of trendy marketing words but you easily get lost in his company examples. He does a pretty bad job of tying the examples back to the concept. It's unclear in several cases why he is using certain companies as examples.
5,I have a primal brand MELBOHEMIAN....coming soon!,fab! loved it ......And I have my primal brand......watch out soon for MELBOHEMIAN.COMEasy to understand and quick to read.
2,Not the first book to read on branding,"I felt the book was too far off the track on the ""how to"" portion of branding."
2,Nice to look at but a poor design.,"I purchased several of the 4"" and 6"" Irwin c-clamps and was immediately disapointed. Not only is the ""double threaded screw"" slow to adjust (you have to turn it twice as many times to tighten) it becomes difficult and binds before the screw reaches the maximum opening distance. The second time I used them one of the clamps broke while I was tightening it right at one of the bends in the ""c"" casting and gave my thumb a heck of a whack. I use c-clamps almost every day in my work as a boatbuilder and this has never happened with any of the ""Adjustable Clamp"" brand clamps that are in use at the shop. These clamps are pretty to look at but not worth the money. I would have given them one star but I was able to complete the glue-up successfully."
1,It bent the first time I used it.,"I used this clamp to press the piston back into a brake caliper on a car. For comparison, my dirt cheap 6"" c-clamp from an off-brand distributor has done this many, many times over the last few years. This one twisted like a pretzel the first time I used it.Update: Just received a replacement and it, fresh out of the box, already has a bit of a twist to it. When I screw it closed, the screw hits the anvil off-center. (After using the first one once, it's screw stops more than an inch to the left of the anvil.) I highly recommend against buying this product."
1,Icky for fine hair,"If you have fine hair, I would not recommend this. It weighs down my hair and makes it feel oily. Stick with Shampoo One."
5,GREAT FRIENDS AND GREAT PLAYERS,Well its about time to put things in the right order.WE HAVE HERE FIVE EXCELLENT JAZZ MUSICIANS which play with all their heart and all their mind focused in the real values of jazz.THEY PLAY MAINLY FOR THE HONOUR AND THE TRADITION OF JAZZ AND NOT FOR THEIR NAMES .They play just the opposite to the empty maistream of today they play contrary to what is regarded as an awful must of todays sterile repetitions .Although recorded twenty years ago it still keeps a lot of its fresh aroma.Maybe not so good in timing but has a lot of good improvisation aspects an airy sound and a special sonic signature of realism and authority .THIS RECORDING BELONGS NOT IN THE PAST NOT IN THE FUTURE OF JAZZ . IT BELONGS TO THE PERSONALITY AND IDIOSYNCRACY OF JAZZ WITH A LOT OF SENTIMENTAL VALUE IN ITS LUGGAGE .
4,Hard Bop delight,"A very good session with a brilliant group of leaders. It's a particoular pleasure for me to listen piano great Stanley Cowell surrouded by some musicians at his level. They're clearly all enjoying their time together, here, as showed by the music they play."
1,I do not recomend it,Tthe cup holder is to big and bulky for a normal stroller. After my son completed his first birthday I decided to buy him a Maclaren Quest. Since the Quest doesn't bring a cup holder I decided to buy one. When it came by mail I immediately noticed it was too big and I put it away.
1,Universal?? What strollers DOES this thing fit?,"We have a Quinny and a Maclaren (Volo) and this cup holder is wayyyy too big. I know now that ""Universal"" does not indeed mean that. I am assuming this only fits a Bugaboo. It doesnt hold a cup of coffee in a paper cup. Its basically an over priced water bottle holder. Dont waste your money..."
1,Wouldn't buy it again,I bought this after reading the amazon reviews a about how great it was... You can't put anything without a cap in here because it will spill. It also doesn't stand upright it twirls around on the handle bar causing things to spill further. Waste of money
1,Disappointed,"This product is neither ""universal"" nor a ""cup holder"". It didn't fit well either of my strollers, so I was afraid to use it. Disappointed to say the least. Gonna have to train the little one to carry my hot coffee! LOL."
5,Not just for Valco strollers,"I have a Baby Jogger City Double. Any one familiar with Baby Jogger will tell you they make awesome strollers, but rip you off on the accessories. Not that Valco's are cheap; they're pricey too.That being said, I saw this in Buy Buy Baby (Bed, Bath & Beyond's answer to Babies R Us). It was a couple dollars cheaper, and with my 20% off coupon, it was even less.The best thing is this is a universal mount. It works well holding my travel coffee mug or my Kleen Kanteen. It was a little tricky to install, but take a few minutes to read the instructions and you'll get it."
4,Does its job but a couple of caveats...,"The Valco Universal Cup Holder fulfills its purpose in life; it holds many different sizes of cups and stays afixed to a stroller.However, it was relatively difficult to attach to the stroller, both because of the need for force and because the directions were godawful. It also sometimes gets in the way of folding our Maclaren Quest, but this is manageable.Overall, it is a decent product, but clearer instructions and easier installation would push it up to 5 stars."
5,Great Cup Holder,I love this cup holder especially how it adjusts when you fold the stroller. Best of all it fits my 1 liter water bottle and anything else. beats all the others that i have tried hands down
5,Superior cup holder,"This cup holder came with my Valco jogger and I can't think of a negative thing to say about it. I even take it off the Valco and attach it to my Britax B-Ready stroller because I like it so much more than the holder that came with the B-Ready. It's sturdy and keeps my drink, hot or cold, in place - thanks to the little grippers on the inside. Even when we're off-road or jogging, I've never had a problem with my drink rattling around the holder like some other models (which is annoying). Great job, Valco."
3,Reasonable cup holder,Did the job. Doesn't lock down like I would like. I use it on my wheelchair. Doesn't quite fit other types of cups.
1,Barely functional even on a valco stroller,"I didn't like this cup holder at all. I have a valco stroller (and like it) and I couldn't get the cup holder tight on the stroller. It's not easy to get a coffee cup in and out either. I know there has to be a better cup holder out there. Additionally, I hardly think since it doesn't fit on a Valco stroller that it could even remotely be considered universal. Poorly played, valco."
3,Does an ok job,"It is somewhat universal in that it fits on both strollers (McClaren and Bugaboo). But I wish the inside was more snug (the cup holds, but there's always some of the beverage leaking on the stroller...or the kid on the board). For the bugaboo, the bugaboo cupholder does a better job (in terms of holding the drink), however, I have not found one that works perfectly- the bugaboo cupholder keeps falling off the stroller everytime I recline the seat!!!"
1,Very poor quality,"I bought this product because of the good reviews, however, I was very disappointed upon receiving it. I noticed that the plastic it is made of was of very poor quality as soon as I opened it. Also, I have an UppaBaby Vista stroller, and the fit is TERRIBLE. My husband tried to adjust it, and still it kept moving around. I would not recommend this product to anyone. I'm sure there are much better cup holders out there."
4,Great cup holder,Easy to install and fits all types of strollers and other items with round handles. Easy to move from one stroller to another. We have four so that we are never without a holder for our mochas. We have had two of them for almost three (3) years without any issues.
5,Indispensable,"Much needed for our stroller since it did not come with a cup holder.Sturdy construction, adjustable clamp, and fits most size cups."
4,Very good,This movie is the lost performances from 'That's the way it is' and 'Elvis on tour'. It shows rehearsal scenes and the side of Elvs all Elvis fans love ..............seeing him perform on stage with all his charisma.
4,"frustration and age, days and years.","This product helps bring out new skin cells at applied area. Maybe the hydrolyzed elastin and soluble collagen ripens and plumps the skin, at initial trial the affected area almost seems to ""crave"" or ""beg for"" more usage. It brings youth and tenderness to the applied skin area. However, the affected skin area increases in density (plump) and sometimes defines and increases the wrinkles while this product advertises to minimize them. All in all, this is somewhat effective. Smile like a baby!"
4,Good supplemental title.,"A wealth of knowledge is in here, although as I've noticed with a lot of Pavel's books, there is a lot of advertising. Wade through that, and this is a great supplemental book. Not stellar on it's own. I got this with Instant Flexibility Through Mastering Muscle, Convict Conditioning, The Naked Warrior, and You Are Your Own Gym. Together, they make a powerful pack for fitness.Guess now I'm advertising...:{"
3,Average,"This book offers some stretching drills and some calisthenic routines. Could be useful for those who are starting out on an exercise program and some of the exercises may improve your flexibility. The author's opinions on a few routines(squars and neck exercises) are not supported or substantiated by any research or any authority. Overall it has some useful advice and tips, but it is not an authoritative work."
3,"Okay, but overpriced","I can't give it more than three stars because it's overpriced. Nothing really wrong with the content, it's just not worth the asking price.You can find some great mobility drills in Harry Wong's book Dynamic Strength.....for about $9.95!"
1,rip off,This material could've been condensed down to a long brochure. Nearly the same info as found in 'Relax into Stretch' which I stupidly bought as a companion book (It is not more than a few good pages of info either)
4,Super Joints: Russian Longevity Secrets for Pain-Free movement,"This book is divided into two parts. Part one deals with exercises for strengthening joints. Part two focuses on more intense athletic exercise.Good pictoral illustations, some text provides limited instructions.Helpful book. Reader needs to have clear understanding of own health assessment."
3,Too much cheesy advertising for the price!,No doubt Pavel Tsatsouline is in incredible shape....but for $34.95....the book had what seemed like 20 pages of cheesy advertising...!!! Check out Kit Laughlins' Stretching and FLexibility before buying any of Pavels books.....its half the price and twice the book in all ways!!!
1,three $35 books on the same thing,"Pavels got -three- 120 page books on stretching, Do new ideas keep coming to him after the last book is already out? I don't think so. Big print, lots of unused page space, and much attitude take up what could easily fit into one book,(one cheaper book)."
3,WILL THE REAL EDGAR RICE BURROUGHS STAND UP?,"cover art by Don Maitz. David Lake takes a shot at continuing the saga of Edgar Rice Burroughs. When Tom Carson caught sight of the third planet of 82 Eridani he recognized at once its resemblance to that imaginary Mars called ""Barsoom"" of the ancient novelist Edgar Rice Burroughs' character John Carter, Warlord of Mars. Of course, there were indeed vital variations that would eventually trip up the self-deceived travelers from the 24th century Earth. Therein hangs the tale. David Lake wrote another one, that is Warlords of Xuma."
4,Just the basics,This is just your average clay cat litter. Not really better or worse than others in this price range. It's just nice to have it home-delivered instead of lugging it from the grocery store.
4,Potentially great,"the author's thesis that 1939 is essentially different from our own time makes it almost impossible for him to accomplish his 2nd purpose, to make us feel like we were there. Still, a much more than worthwhile work."
4,A captivating mix of fact and fiction.,"Describing the fair, Gelernter expores the attitudes and expectations of the world in 1939. He has some fasinating insights on the details of the fair. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in cultural history"
2,Make it stop!!!,"I am in high school and this was a book recommended to me by my US history teacher. I thought that the book was far from linear and that the author branched out on too many topics. This book described the fair in great detail, but failed to describe many of the exhibits and failed to capture my interest. I was tourtured through reading this book, and the only thing that was interesting was the outward description of the fair. The book did not describe the underlying theme of the fair in good detail. The love story was unneccessary and was only there as a human interest story. I do not recommend anyone reading this book."
5,Both insightful and delightful....,Gelernter presents a powerful argument(s) for the moral and motivational decline of our society since the late 1930's- as highlighted by the theme and focus of the 1939 World's Fair
1,2 units failed,"I have owned two of these units. Both failed the same way. It is a wonderful machine when it works well, but it doesn't for long. For no reason The machine will produce two elongated, very grainy, side by side images on the screen and most of the feature (such as shuffle play) quit working. It still plays audio CDs one disc at a time."
5,Classic works on mid-century jewelry,"As a lifelong collector of mid-century plastic jewelry, I have found the literature on the subject to be amaturish and rather incomplete. No More! This excellent work by Ms Klein certainly will become the ""bible"" in this field and I feel will overshadow other works in print. The histories, methods of deteriming material, and care and repair as well as the splendid photography make this book a ""must"" for every collector and dealer."
4,Great book,Very nice book with a lot of excellent photos.Explanation of the plastic materials which are used in the jewelry.Description of jewelry after manufacturers and also a part organized in colour.
4,keeps your bags tidy,"This is a great way to store all the plastic bags you get. It only took minutes to mount the unit on the wall or inside a cabinet or pantry with either screws and/or two sided tape which is included. I mounted mine inside my pantry. It holds a lot of bags, more than it states on the box! It keeps my pantry looking tdy and it has a pretty sleek finish. Love it!"
4,good thing to have,i really like this product it keeps all the bags out of the way! it is a little tough to pull bags back out of it so i only put 15-20 bags in there and throw the rest out. but really thats all i need. would buy again.
5,Very Happy,"I didn't know a product like this even existed! I stumbled upon it on accident, I've been keeping extra bags in a larger bag under the sink my whole life. No this isn't a necessity product, life will function fine if your extra bags are just under the sink... But it is a nice organizational product. And I'm happy with my purchase."
2,"Nice looking, but too small.","This product is nice looking and attractive; looks great with updated kitchen appliances, unfortunately it falls short in that it is so small, it hardly holds more than about 12 bags. Not functional at all."
