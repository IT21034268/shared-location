1,Bad Bungee,These bungees are the worst. The stretch is week and construction is ultra cheap. Would not trust them for anything important. I don't think I would buy another product from this company.
1,Buffalo bungee cords,"Pure junk, these cords are the worst ever i have bought. I bought two containers of these cords at separate times giving the benifit of the doubt, that the first container was defective. they last on average two months. Don't waste your money buying cords."
1,You get what you pay for !!,"Length:: 0:01 MinsWell folks, price & quantity where right. Here is a photo of blue bungies in this purchase. The red bungie I have had holding tarp for 9 months. The blue bungies where this product after 2 and a half weeks. Judge for yourself."
2,Old Elastic,"Nice bright colors and assorted sizes. Elasticity is horrible. Anyone who has had an elastic waistband or hair tie get old know what I'm talking about. Seems like once you stretch it out, it does not go back. Works ok if not planning on reusing."
1,Absolute garbage.,"Absolute garbage. I've only used the longest pieces so far. They lasted less then two weeks before snapping, and nearly taking out my eye. DON'T PURCHASE THIS BUNGEE. Spend a little more and get the heavy duty ones."
3,good for lite duty,"We needed various bungees to hold our 30ftx50ft tarp on a 30ft RV for winter storage. They did the job; however, by the end of winter they were dead...."
2,barely what you'd consider a bungie cord,"Well... the price point is great, BUT on these puppies, you get what you pay for. They appear to be about 50% less strength than what you'd think of stretching a bungie cord. Maybe they've produced them with fewer strands of rubber or something to save the EARTH or something, but these bungies are WEAK. I'm sending mine back. Not acceptable for my needs..... but ... I'll give 'em props on the price... great price for weakee bungie cords..."
1,Not what they appear to be. Quality sucks,"I thought this item was to good to be true and it is. They appear like standard bungee's, however they are junk. Their size is smaller in diameter, and the elastic is lousy. save you money, these are not as they appear to be."
3,Not worth it,"Harbour freight has the same.....the give on the elastive is poor, no spring too it. It might last over the winter, but I had to fix them twice so far.....I guess they are good for something, but not holing tarps down."
1,Not a good bungee cord,"Great price and a nice quantity and size selection, but using the cords once causes them to stretch and lose their shape. Pick other bungees and forget these."
2,Cheap. Very Cheap.,"These bungee cords were garbage. Save your money and buy higher quality ones. They may be ok to secure light things, but if you over stretch them, they don't go back to their original size and won't stretch easily afterwards. Also, I've had more than a few fall apart at the ends where the hooks are attached. Also, leave them out in the rain once, and they are ruined."
3,They do the job - jut let them air out first,"They do the trick, not for any major loads, but fine for us. Just make sure to let them air out for at least a couple days when you get them, they have a really toxic chemical smell."
4,A great workout!,"I've had this video for years, and I found it to be a very effective workout, at least for a beginner. The first few times I tried it, I could barely get through the whole video, but after a while I was able to do it with no problem. This video really does give you results, and it can be modified by adding heavier or lighter weights, depending on your fitness level.The only drawback is that this video is from the early 90s, and it really shows in the outfits, hairstyles, and music. But other than that, I would definitely recommend this workout."
5,BEST BAND ALIVE.,"I have never written a review for Amazon. I see no reason why I should...plenty of other people do a fine job. However, in this case, I have just one quick comment.THE THERMALS ARE THE BEST BAND ALIVE.If you don't think so, you're dumb.That's all, thanks!"
3,"O.K, not great","Difficult to program. Remote temperature/humidity sensor had to be within 30 feet of base otherwise had to constantly re-set to ""find"" signal. Wind speed virtually useless as it reads an average over a ten minute time frame. Gusts reading seemed off by 15 to 40%, as well.One needs altitude and latitude and longitude in order to get accurate info from some of the features.Weather prediction surprisingly accurate."
1,Absolute crap!,"I'm furious. I've spent all day trying to reconcile, with someone from Target, the fact that this piece of junk ruptured just beyond the 90 day period. God help me, I will never never never buy another Polaroid product and I am seriously considering NEVER shopping at Target again. What crap!!!"
1,Polaroid lost my business also,"Had the same problems as the other reviewers. LOVED this product when it worked - but after 7 months it died and Polaroid says ""sorry"" $110 to replace the inside power supply. No guarantees that the new one will work for very long.I would not recommend buying this item unless you get the extended warranty. I would think that if Polaroid has had this much problems with a particular part they would fix to keep there customers. I won't be buying any of their products in the future!"
1,Nothing Works Any More,"After about a year of use, our unit has stopped functioning...nothing works. Based on the examples of Polaroid's response to other reviewers' complaints about the performance, or lack of performance of this unit, I've decided not to waste my time calling them. If you're in the market for an under-the-cabinet combo, you might consider buying a brand other than this one. Next time, I know I will."
1,Poor quality-no follow up service,I bought this for my husband for our anniversary and within 6 months the picture no longer worked. All audio worked though. When my husband called Polaroid they indicated to us that they could do nothing for us unless we wanted to pay about $150 to have them fix it....plus shipping. I also found out that this is a problem with this particular television when I went back to the store I purchased it from - others had their television screen stop working and Polaroid indicated they would be charged for the repairs.....very sorry customer service when there is obviously a problem with the unit - not the user.
1,It makes me so angry,Just like most people while it worked it worked great BUT then the screen stopped working 3 months after I started using it. Will never buy Polaroid again. ARG! Oh I'm over my 90 days so yes they will replace with out of warranty payment of $120.00 plus shipping and tax. ARG ARG!
1,Sad in my kitchen,I received this TV as a Christmas gift and the screen went completely blank just after the warrenty ended and of course Polaroid would do nothing for us. I would not recommend this TV. Plus you had a stand directly in front of it to see the image on the screen clearly. Too much money for such poor quality!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,PIECE OF JUNK,This product is a piece of junk. After six months the screen went black. Polaroid has a 90-day warranty so our options are take it to a repair shop or pay Polaroid $110 for a replacement unit. Avoid this product.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"This is my 2nd FDM0700A model and both have died. The first one died luckily within the first 90 days and Sam's Club replaced for free. The 2nd unit which I bought in October 2005 died in Nov. 2006. I am checking out other ratings and would not buy another one, even if Polaroid offered to discount. The picture quality was also poor. If there were no star rating that's what I would rate this item. POOR POOR POOR!"
1,Never EVER again!,"Same story as everyone else here it looks like...got it for a family C'mas gift in 2005 and died after less than 6 months of ADULT use. (Kids were not allowed to touch it.) Bogus deal and WORTHLESS product! Even when we went back to Target to exchange it, the display model was also on the blink. We assume the power supply went bad on both of them. Never did get that exchange and we still have a nice looking decoration mounted to our cabinet. Gee, it was nice WHEN it worked."
1,TERRIBLE PRODUCT-TERRIBLE COMPANY!,"MY FIRST ONE QUIT WORKING ABOUT 7 MONTHS AFTER I BOUGHT IT. I WAS ABLE TO EXCHANGE IT AT TARGET FOR ANOTHER. THIS ONE QUIT WORKING 5 MONTHS LATER. BOTH TIMES IT JUST WOULDN'T POWER UP ANY MORE. I CALLED POLAROID AND THEY WERE VERY RUDE TO ME. SAME BULL AS IT SOUNDS LIKE OTHER PEOPLE WERE TOLD, 90 DAY WARRENTY. THE LADY TRIED TELLING ME THAT THEY HAVEN'T HAD ANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS PRODUCT. SHE ALSO TOLD ME I COULD REPLACE IT FOR $110. DO THEY THINK WE ARE COMPLETELY STUPID? ANY WAY, IF ANYBODY HAS ANY IDEA HOW TO GET POLAROID TO FIX THIS PROBLEM, I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR IT. I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT WHEN YOU SPEND THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY ON SOMETHING, THAT IT ONLY LASTS A FEW MONTHS. VERY FUSTRATING!!!"
1,Also disgusted with this product,See the above reviews - similar situation. After only about 11 months the AC adapter failed. Went to Radio Shack to find a replacement after calling Polaroid who was willing to replace the whole unit for $60. Unfortunately Radio Shack did not have power supplies with sufficient amperage to replace this thing. Additionally there is a CD stuck in it which I cannot get out and Polaroid apparently can't promise to return to me. Wish I had read these reviews prior to buying. After seeing the difficulties everyone else has had with these things I don't think I'm going to send this back - may never see it again.... Last time I buy Polaroid - sad to see Ed Land's company fall so far.
1,Buy the Sony Instead,"Same old story - screen dies after 6 months. I had more of an issue with the Polaroid Customer Service rep that actually told me they're new at making TVs and they don't have all the bugs worked out of these. Expecting to hear about a recall or free replacement (ha, ha), all I got was the $110 line. Never will I buy Polaroid again (ironically we're also having issues with our portable Polaroid DVD player.)"
1,Zero Stars,"So tell me, how can this company continue to manufacture this product if it simply does not work? We bought ours back in at the start of the kitchen remodel, left it in the box. Finished remodel, took unit out of box.Guess what? Screen was black. Refused to work.Fortunately we bought it at Sam's Club, who took it back without question, in spite of the fact that we had the unit well in excess of 6 months (long kitchen remodel...)."
1,"Polaroid 7"" Under-the-Cabinet LCD / DVD is disposable!!!","I purchased this product less than a year ago - mounted for use in late October, 2005 and like numerous others the LCD went out over 3 months ago providing only 6 months of use. Called Polaroid - same story - 3 months warranty - will replace upon return of unit and $110.00. When I asked if they should have a recall on this product because numerous customers reported the same problem, Polaroid stated that for the number sold that the complaints received were not sufficient. I loved the product while it worked, however it is overpriced since they determine it to be disposable (working only 6 months or less). Recommend not purchasing if you can't afford replacement every few months."
3,Good if it lasts!!!,I bought this unit for $150 (200 - $50 rebate) three days ago. After installing it I noticed that the remote control was defective. I went back to radio shack and got a replacement plus a 2 year extended warranty for $50. It works fine and my kids love it. SO I guess this unit will last me for at least 2 years.
1,Polaroid has lost my business,Lasted for 5 months. The power supply in the machine failed and when I contacted Polaroid (I was amazed to get to a customer service agent in about 1 minute!) they informed me this machine only has a 3 month warranty. $110 to replace if I chose to.Even when it was working properly it wasn't that great. The buttons on the face of the machine were slow to respond (remote was much better).The radio reception was terrible. Never able to receive any AM stations.Overall - DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE!
2,Only Lasted Four Months!,My wife and I loved the unit - nice styling and lots of functionality. After four months the power supply went bad and it cost $35 to ship a new one out of warranty only to find the LCD was now bad (black screen). We had NO trouble getting a hold of tech support at Polaroid for either issue.. but after the 90 days warranty expires they only have a $160 replacement to offer. VERY disappointed! Definitely purchase an extended 1 or 2 year warranty if you decide to buy this unit
2,Worked Great! ...for a week...,"Got the unit; installed it; tested all the functions (CD, DVD, TV, Radio). It worked great!However, after a week of just using the radio and the CD player, I tried to turn back on the TV or the DVD. The sound was good; however, the screen was black. If I shown a strong flashlight on the screen, I could just make out what was on the screen. But, there was NO illumination.It seems to me that Polaroid has a few ""kinks"" to work out before this is a usable product."
5,wife loves it!,"Samsclub had the unit for a great price so I got it for my wife on Mothers day. I mounted it in the kitchen, using the template, cabled it to cable tv input and attached the fm antenna.I was concerned about the previous reviews and the unit dying so I literally played dvd's, cd's, tv, and radio constant for many days. I have not had any problems with the unit.the wife loves it. The screen is nice and bright (its set to the default brightness setting - low) and the DVD player has played anything I have thrown at it (- dvd -r, dvd +r, dvd -+rw) and everything plays just fine.It seems that Polaroid thought of pretty much everything when they designed the unit. The remote control is magnetized so it sticks to the oven and is laid out very well, the controls on the unit front are easy to use.All in all, it's been a fantastic puchase and I don't know why the two other reviewers had such problems with their units."
1,Should have read the reviews first,Mine lasted less than 5 months. The screen went black (backlighting out?) Then I read other reviews and saw that Polaroid only offers a 90 day warranty. DO NOT BUY this product. Just pile your money on the floor and set it on fire. You'll get more out of it.
1,Had two of them and they both broke!,I had one for about 5 months and braught it back because the screen went out. The second one lasted 4 months. I'll never buy another Poloroid product again.
1,This is a peice of bad equipment Don't buy!!!!!!,"My wife bought this for her sewing room so she could at least listen to movies or cd music while she worked sewing. Then one day the LCD TV screen went black, It appears that the TV has know isues for this happening all the time to everybody and the company does not stand behind thier product. Stay away from this thing or you'll be throwing good money.......Enough said!!No stars for this thing"
1,Died,"Unit just died, same story as everyone else, power still active but no display. This is really a poor quality product that Polaroid should recall before their name becomes worthless."
1,"Add another one to ""It Died"" total.",...same as most of the other reviews: used it occasionally for ~ year and then one day it just stopped working. External Power Supply OK. Something internal seems shorted.Frustrating.
1,SAMS CLUB GAVE ME BACK MY MONEY,"I purchased this August 2005, but did not install until March 2006. Only used the radio, not daily but on weekends mostly. Died in December. Because no other unit had the same screw pattern and I didn't want to drill 4 new monster holes in the cabinet I considered paying for a replacement until I saw all these negative reviews. I called Sam's Club where I purchased the unit for $199 and told them its history. They asked if I had the box, I said why would I. They said bring it back with your receipt if you have it! Got my money back today! Replaced it with a GPX with 7"" TV for $39. If it lasts a year I'll be happy, even with the new holes"
2,Tendentious and scattered,"I am an academic, but US history is not my field. I wanted to read a good general history of the US from the end of reconstruction to the end of WWI and so I picked up this book. I can't say I much cared for it. It is hard to turn issues like bimetalism and greenbackism into a compelling story, so it is not surprising that Painter falls short. But his obviously leftist account struck me as too biased -- despite the fact that I share his political beliefs. The book attempts to cover a little bit of everything that happened in this period, but ends up feeling more scattered than comprehensive, with very brief one and two page sections on various subjects crowded together in chapters with very little to hold them together. The prose is clear and readable, but hardly elegant and engaging. If you want an engaging general history of this period, I would advise you to look elsewhere."
4,This book was good.I read a lot of books and I like this one,This book was good. Painter is a good author
4,na,"The book has wonderful images. I still have trouble following some of the instructions. Will take a while. Would be nice if there is some recom-mendations on the type of paper. Because of the complicated folds, many of the types of paper I used do not unfold very well."
4,animal origami review,"This book contains many different types of animals and keeps my children busy on their own for hours on end, using creativity and skill to create lasting art. The used book was delivered with turned edges and cracks, but in as good a condition as was expressed in the sales ad.I would recommend this book to anyone interested in origami."
4,Easy step by step,Great step by step instructions on how to fold tons of cool animals. My daughter spent a happy Saturday afternoon making a zoo.
3,A bit disappointing,"This book did not really have the key to Harry Potter. It was more geared toward explaining the religious meaning behind Harry Potter. I was hoping for theories, but got mostly analysis from a religious point of view. If that's what you are looking for, then this is the book for you. But if you are looking for Harry Potter theories and hints, You should try Ultimate Unofficial guide to the Mysteries of Harry Potter."
3,Thought Provoking but Needs Typist,"This book has some great thought provoking ideas but these are masked by the many typos throughout. In one particular paragraph the 9 errors caught were extremely distracting. It is ashame the errors are so much, I think this book could be taken very seriously if it was edited better.I love the diagrams and maps throughout the book, they really helped to illustrate the points. His view on the topic of Harry and religion is interesting. It has helped me in my constant defense for the books (against Christian friends, family, and neighbors). I think in a couple of sections, though, he pushes the envelope a tad too far and some areas seem like rambling. It is in need of better organization, in some spots I felt like I was reading a high school research paper.All in all a good read...but requires patience!"
1,Analyze this?,"This is a meaningless attempt to find meaning in works of fiction by attempting to psychoanalyze the author, her readers and the fictional characters. Too dry and boring for younger readers and adults alike. This appears to be nothing more than an attempt to make more money off the Harry Potter craze."
1,I sent mine back to Amazon,"The software requires a ""patch""...not a big deal.Once I got the thing up and running my attention span was about 5 minutes. The ""goofiness"" is a detriment and the aspect of trying to learn is hindered by the balance of trying to figure out how to use the software.It has a tutorial but that is a waste of time as well.If you are SERIOUS about trying to learn some basic conversational Spanish, try something else. Don't waste your time or money on this one..."
5,Food for the Soul,"Souls are brought and sold like drugs on the streets of LA, a business which remained a secret, until they take one soul too many. A beautiful soul of an innocent child is used to pay off a gambling debt. Doyle's vision brings Angel to the rescue. But the path is difficult, Angel is troubled by memories of his sister, the sister who loved him, the sister who thought him an angel right before he took her life. Angel is driven to succeed to find redemption in the act of restoring the child's soul. The author has woven humor and action into a lovely story of dark magic and innocence. You will never look at a garden troll the same way again. Set in the early part of the first season it is refreshing to see Doyle moon over Cordelia again. Harry, Doyle's former wife makes an appearance. I recommend this book to readers who enjoy Angel, the Television Series as well as newcomers who like horror fiction."
3,Ball ToyZ,"I bought this for my son's First Birthday party to keep the kids busy. The little ones really enjoyed it. It did wind up with a small hole in it, but we were able to patch it up. It came with 100 balls (some did not have a lot of air in them), but in order to fill the pit, you need to get an extra 100 balls."
3,Good idea but not durable,"We bought this as a Christmas gift for our then 9mos old daughter. She & her 3 yr old brother loved it! Seven mos later they still play with it every day even though it is completely falling apart. We had to supplement the balls from day one - but we had read the reviews so we expected that. Over time the ""walls"" & ball ramp plastic started to release air and every morning they would be less firm. The ramp sides came off after 6 mos & the entire thing is almost completely ruined after 7 mos. The kids still love it - but it's an eyesore! I wish they made this in a more durable material. They've really learned to share & play well with each other spending time so close. And all of their friends love it too."
3,Good Instruction,"Atea, is a respected and well known dancer the in Belly Dance community. The instruction is well said and demonstrated, but the sets and music are cheesy. I wish that Atea would have chosen a natural setting instead of a studio one, it would have come across more fluidly."
1,Not a very good video,"I bought this video in hopes that it had new moves on it, to go along with other DVD's that I have bought. It was a complete disaster. My Husband even fell asleep during it. This video is as basic as you can get and gives you no real good instructional value. I have all of Neena and Veena's, Dolphina's, and Jillina's Dvds, they are far better to learn from and teach a nice variety of moves. Don't waste your money on this one. It is not worth it."
2,Disapointing,I was very disapointed with this video. It just seems very dated and the 'to camara' spoken parts are just horrid!To be fair the actual instruction part is quite good but I was so put off by the rest that I doubt I would even put this in the player again!Guess that will teach me to read other peoples reviews befor I order in future.
1,Terrible,"I think this video is terrible. It is no good as an instructional video. There is a voice over in a hurried, boring, monotone, that is impossible to correlate with what the dancers are doing, because they just keep going without closeups or stopping to demonstrate and explain a move. Some of the participants are difficult to take seriously. I consider it a waste of money."
2,disappointing,"Disappointment! This was the only word that came to mind. The tape is only 40 mins long, with about 26 mins. of instruction time. The only person that is worth watching is the brunette.I think that buying this tape is a waste of time and money."
2,Not worth it,"The instruction portion of the video isn't anything you won't learn in a beginner belly dance class. Atea is very stiff on the narrative parts, and I wasn't very impressed with her belly dancing skills compared to some of the other dancers on the video. While it was interesting to see some of the variety in the routines presented, there were only 2 I felt had any merit, and 1 dancer who was so bad it bordered on offensive."
3,An okay collection of case studies,"This book is an ""okay"" set of case studies. I say okay because there is no real cohesive structure to the book and the case studies themselves are a little stale, most harking back to the early and mid nineties. Of course, since the book was published in 1997, this is to be expected. If I had had the foresight, I would have either waited for another edition (if one is forthcoming) or look for another one. Aside from the dated material, the case studies were written by many different people. This reduces the book's usefulness as a study tool, or even a good read. Personally, I would have liked to have a little analysis by the authors. I'd have to rate this book as average."
3,Good Cases Covered,"This book can be considered above average. However, it does not cover too many cutting edge technology related cases that interests the today's entrepreneur. Nonetheless, the book can be a starting ground to kick-start anybody's little venture and avoid some of the mistakes covered in the cases."
4,I wish it wouldn't drip,"I'm glad I finally made the change from buying bottled water to drinking filtered water. However, just about every time I use the spigot, it drips on the fridge shelf below...ugh"
4,Almost Perfect,"This thing delivers the best and cleanest water I've ever had.The only reason for not giving it the fifth star is the fact that the ""stage 2 filters"" that they so loudly brag about everywhere does NOT fit. Not even on their website do they say that the filters you'll need are called ""Premium Stage 2"", which are much harder to get your hands on. They don't even sell them on amazon. Target has had them so far...Except from that; a super great gadget!"
5,"Great Size, Ok Filtering","Love the size & design. Unfortunately, I don't think the filter removes Flouride, natural Arsenic, & only partially removes Chlorine. Update: it's been 4 years since I purchased, & this still works great."
1,Disappointed!!,"This is not my first Brita but this is my first ""new filter"" design Brita. I feel duped. There was nothing said in the description that the filter design had changed. So now I have 5 old style new filters I can't use. This is not the worst part. The new filter is HORRIBLE! It get clogged and doesn't allow the water to flow thru to the bottom. Instead the water sits at the top trapped. I would return this whole unit but unfortunately I thru out the box."
3,Dispensing tap broke after 6 months,"This is a good filter. However, the quality of the dispenser tap is poor. The little dongle on the dispenser came off after 6 months of use and try as I might, I couldn't get it to fit back properly. Was good while it worked."
5,Great tasting water.,"It's compact. Functional. Quick. Effective. I really like the blue color in the fridge too. Don't feel like it will be an ongoing expense and it's not worth it - the filters last far longer than two months, many people can get four or six months out of one. And filters are much, much cheaper than bottled water. Save the planet, abandon plastic bottles and switch to a pur water filter - or one of equivalent amazement."
3,Green mold anyone?,"I've had this pitcher for about a year and a half now. Inside the pitcher, toward the end of the pouring mechanism, is a circular shape that contains a black washer. From what I can tell, the area surrounding the washer is enclosed -- and yet, for the past six months I have had green mold within this area that surrounds the washer. I called Pur Customer Service, but they were little help other than to tell me to wash out the pitcher between fillings. I don't wash it that often, but there doesn't appear to be any way to get water intentionally into this washer area to clean it out. I assume that just the ongoing dampness surrounding this area has resulted in the mold because there is probably air trapped within.Is anyone else having this problem? If so, has anyone figured out a way to clean and remove the mold?Any feedback is appreciated."
3,too slow/possibly defective filter,"I believe my filter was defective. Drainage was too slow/would stop before filling the filtered water compartment. Water level would fill less than half capacity and stay there, which resulted in a lot of unfiltered water staying in the top compartment, sloshing around. Decided to return and go with a brita pitcher unit-easier to handle too."
4,Great Value,"I bought the Pur water dispenser because I going through almost a case of water every week and decided it was silly to spend so much money on bottled water. I wanted a large pitcher so I didn't have to fill it more than once a day. This one works great. The top reservoir holds about 12 cups of water and filters it in less than 30 minutes. The water has a clean, refreshing taste and the dispenser easily fits inside my refrigerator. I keep it on the counter because I prefer room temperature water most of the time. Overall, it's a great value. The only thing that could make it better would be adding measure marks on the side so that you can easily tell how many cups of water remain in the dispenser."
5,Should've gotten one a long time ago!,I had been debating a PUR pitcher for a while and when I saw this tank I decided to go for it. I am very happy to not be buying the plastic containers of water anymore. This is perfect for the 2 of us. It is a little slow in filtering water but as long as you're on top of filling it up here and there it's fine. I love the slim design and have already been asked a couple of times where I got it. I'm very happy about it!
2,Didn't take the bad tase out,"I have no way of knowing if this filter purified our water or not, but I do know that the water still tastes as bad as it did before. I played with the cartridge to make sure it was in tightly and it didn't make any difference."
4,Tastes Great!,I am extremely pleased with this product. The taste is superior to the Brita Water filters on the market. The design is excellent since it fits easily in the refrigerator due to it's slim design. My only recommendation is that the company creates a more destinct and colorful line of water pitchers. Brita has a 5 star design but 2 star taste. Pur is superior in taste but not in design.
4,Made my life easier!,"Very simple to use, doesn't take up much space in fridge and it can be angeled so the door will shut. We fill it about every other day. Never have to buy those plastic bottles again!"
4,"Great filter, kinda big","This is a great filter for your refrigerator. However, it is kinda big. We are sharing an apartment so the filter takes around 1/4 of the entire shelf. It is nice if you put it on a shelf so you can put a glass directly underneath it to remove the water. It is also kinda a hassle to fill up. However, it is better than the smaller filters since you have to fill up less. It is a great product and the water tastes amazing after filtering."
4,"Slim, well designed...awesome!","Got tired of paying big bucks for store bought seltzer, its only water with a little fizz after all...plus didnt need all the extra sodium so thought id give this unit a try, and glad I did! Now it does take a while for the water to filter through, but no biggie as that gives a good indication that the water is actually being filtered. Thin and takes up very little room in the fridge, love the quick opening water handle..quick and easy to use, beats pulling out a gigantic pitcher each time..and holds a good amount..water tastes great too! highly recomended!"
1,No More Disposable Bottles!,"My daughter and her roommates were constantly complaining about the taste of the water in their new apartment(hard water, mineral taste.) I was horrified to learn they were dealing with it by buying bottled water by the case load! I has Amazon ship one of these off, and that brought an end to the disposable bottles. The girls think the water tastes great -- and after visiting this weekend, I have to agree!UPDATE -- Six weeks in, and it was accidentally dropped, empty, less than three feet onto a resilient (not ceramic or other hard surface) floor and it shattered into many pieces. I could maybe understand a crack -- although it really ought be be able to survive that kind of drop -- but to shatter? Something is not right structurally."
5,No more constant pitcher refilling,"It's the perfect shape and size for most refrigerators, and so much more practical than a single pitcher; even for a single person household. Great design and quality."
1,Ok but no very impressive.,"I switched from PUR to CLEAR2O because CONSUMER REPORTS rated CO2 much higher for filtering effectiveness and cost of filters.Note that PUR tacks on an extra unspecified amount for donations to Africa.

3,1.125 gallons of water....on the floor!,"We have a Brita shelf dispenser in the fridge but go through so much water that I bought this Pur dispenser to supplement as well as to compare water quality. This morning after effortlessly refilling the Brita and putting it back in the fridge, I filled the Pur. However, it is very long and narrow, with the only gripping points on the ends, so in trying to maneuver it back into the fridge, it slipped from my hands. When it hit the floor, the spout broke off and a big chunk of the bottom broke off, so all of the water cascaded across the floor. What a mess!It's a poor design and the dispenser needs something on the sides to help you hold it while getting it onto the shelf of a fridge. We only had it for four days but the rest of it seemed all right, and the water tasted good--otherwise I would have rated it lower for the design flaw."
1,"Take stuff out, not put stuff in...??!!???","I am looking to replace bottled water and thought I had found the perfect solution in the Pur 2 Stage Water Dispenser based on the great reviews -- and on sale, to boot! However, when I went to the PUR website to get more detail on the product, noticed that although their filters take out more impurities than the Brita's, they also ADD a toxin, fluoride...?!?! And this is on top of any fluoride that may already be in your community supply, because the website says it doesn't filter that out. Why not save themselves (and the consumers) the $$$ and stick to taking things out, not putting stuff in? What the heck are they thinking?!Luckily, I caught this before I ordered, and saved myself the return. Will keep shopping."
5,Clean cold water all day!,"This product is a no brainer. I work at home and having cold water available all day is priceless. It works perfectly and is large so you don't have to refill it all the time. Water is so important to your health, get this thing."
4,Good filter,"This is a nice filter because it is slim and tall and deep, taking full use of the depth of the frig while keeping it's footprint low and not hogging the whole shelf. Hopefully it is doing what it is advertised to do. It at least takes out the nasty chlorine taste. Keep drinking that water!"
4,"Does the job, I think","This is a great tool if it really works. The thing is, the taste improvement I'm getting may not be the result of actual filtration, but from the chlorine in the water evaporating. Here's the thing, I tried the water immediately after filtration and I honestly could not taste any difference from the tap. Maybe my tap is clean, I live in NY. However, a few hours later, the water seemed to tasted like nothing and crisp, but that might have been due to the evaporation of the chlorine. I'm not sure.However, this thing does seem to do the job. The water keeps cold in the fridge, it's very easy to refill (I use a big cup and pour the water in). It's a good size. I originally thought it would be too big, but the water drains fast, in like 1-2 days!However, I'm skeptical about the acutal filtration. I just can't prove that 'bad stuff' gets filtered out. I'd buy this thing again though, even if only to act as a cooler."
4,realistic review,So here's the deal. I would like this setup alot more if I did not drink so much water everyday. Now I don't know about you but I drink a gallon a day making this almost impossible to use without blowing through filters. However if you are the type of person who drinks soda all day and then balances it out by drinking one 8oz cup of water than this is perfect for you.
3,It still doesn't taste as well as some bottled water,"It seems that it works the best when the filter is new. However, even just after one week's use, the taste already deteriorates. And if one sticks to the recommended amount of water, then one has to endure quite some time of not so great tasting water. Most of our family members are okay with it, but one cannot stand the taste."
2,Hmm not so great..,We have been using this for past 2 months. It worked great during that time. However during the last 2 weeks the water stays stagnant in the reservoir. The filter is dripping extremely slow or not at all. Not sure what happened. I wrote an email to the manufacturers and waiting for their reply. If I have to replace the filter then this seems ridiculously high price. I would not recommend it then. I have read similar issues with some other folks and tried all options out before writing this review but none has helped.
2,Wish it had a smaller lever mechanism,"I drink a lot of water, typically at least a gallon a day. My husband was always complaining about needing to fill the Brita so we thought this would be a great alternative. I'm actually pretty disappointed. I can't for the life of me fill a glass of water with one hand! I wish the lever were smaller so that I could hold my glass and just use one finger to pull the lever down. This is a big deal for me since I just about always have my infant son in my arms. I wish I had stuck with the Brita....."
4,Better tasting water,"This item does provide better tasting/smelling water but when I measured the filtered water for total dissolved solids (TDS) with an accurate meter it was still very high compared to my tap water. Also, I found that the first full batch immediately after putting in a new filter has a chemical aftertaste even when you follow the preparation instructions to the letter. Solution, run at least one fill dispenser through it and throw that water away."
1,Defective material,"After reading the reviews I bought this for my daughter heading off to college. Got the first one home, unboxed filter with intent to clean and prep for her first use. I set the filter on the counter and heard a crack. Looked at the base and saw the left side cracked. Frustrated boxed up took back to the store and exchanged it. Brought the next one home, cleaned it and soaked filter. Boxed it up and took to daughters apartment. Started to fill with water when I noticed the blue inner resevoir had 2"" crack around the lip.After a little more research I have read many complaints of the same filter cracking without reason. I exchagned for a Brita at Target. When asked the customer service rep told me they never see the Brita returned but has seen the Pur returned a number of times. I should have done more homework before buying and saved multiple trips to the store."
3,"Fine water, broken container","The water tastes great, but within about a year of owning the filter, a leak developed. There was a crack in the plastic seam toward the back corner of the product. The slow leak first dribbled within my fridge, creating a mess. I moved the unit onto the kitchen counter so that it could drip into the sink (thinking that it was the tap that had the leak)After discovering water all over the kitchen counter some time later, it was discovered that the leak was coming from the back of the unit."
3,It's just okay..has after taste,"I really wanted to like this process as if so, I'd cut back on both expenses and plastics usage.Alas, unfortunately it was not to be as even though I live in NYC where the water is supposed to taste so divine, after drinking from this dispenser I was left with an after taste..subtle but noticeable.It should be noted that I'm comparing this to my recent favorite find..TalkingRain bottled water..and to me, that's what it's all about.Anyone want to buy a gently used PUR 18 Cup Dispenser..lol"
4,So far so good.....,"I bought the PUR 18 cup dispenser because I got tired of buying water at the grocery store. I had been putting off the purchase because I didn't want to spend the money, but for $25.00 it was worth it. Within 1 month, it has already paid for itself. I have had it for almost three months now, use it appx five times a day, and am very satisfied thus far.Reason for the four stars and not five:The handle is plastic (duh, obviously) and when you pull it down, it just doesn't feel very strong or secure.When I first started using, there were no drips when done dispensing. Now after a few months, there is the ocassional one to two drop of water after dispenser is closed.Water takes a long time to filter through, so you must wait to use, or try to keep it filled at all times.For the money, it was a good investment."
2,Disappointed,"I have been happy with the taste of water filtered throught this dispenser - also with the design and construction. Easy to use, until today. The filter, after just four weeks and one person (who is rarely home,) has completely stopped functioning - 2 quarts of water have sat in the top receptacle for more than 24 hours.Neither the package insert nor the company website mentions this as potential trouble in their troubleshooting sections.I will replace the filter, but I am very disappointed. I estimate the filter lasted significantly less than 20 gallons.PUR 18 Cup Dispenser with One Pitcher Filter DS-1800Z"
5,*glug glug* Ahh...,"Holds a good amount of liquid, spigot works wonderfully, doesn't drip, water tastes great and unlike other products its a good value too."
2,Filters clog like nobodys business,"Got it in early Oct, and about to replace the filter for the third time already.Water flows great for about 2 weeks then it drips slooooooooooowly, taking well over 36 hours to fill the pitcher.People are gonna say its because my water dirty, etc. and blame the victim, but come on, this is ridiculous.When the first filter clogged I called Pur and and they said its not normal. So I thought a original filter was defective and changed to a new one but same scenario repeats.I think these 2-stage filters are defective in design and no way is one going to last the recommended 3 months.Not sure what I'm going to do as its too late to return it now, but I would suggest getting another filter/pitcher combo. Pitcher is great, filter is terrible."
2,"Good filtering, slender profile, but takes too long to filter","I felt compelled to tell consumers how long this filtering system actually takes. I had read reviews about how slow it was, but I wasn't prepared to wait 3 hrs for a single session fill. I'm not kidding. It will take about 3 - 4 hours to fill it. And I'm not talking about filling the entire thing, just for the top tank to be filtered to the bottom tank.Definitely go with the Brita instead."
5,One of my all time favorite purchases,"we drink a LOT of filtered water, and this pitcher allows me to fill it once and have it for a few days, without constantly refilling it. It filters the water well (we use the 2 stage filters) and makes tap water taste like bottled water. We are considering getting one for husbands office refrigerator next."
5,Just what we were looking for,"We have had this for several months, and we love it. I read reviews for many other styles and brands before choosing this one. My only compaint is that it is heavy to get into the fridge after filling, but I don't want it sitting on the counter and I don't want to be refilling a pitcher all day, so that's just me. I'm happy with it."
4,Convenient and tastes great,"I love this product because it's just so convenient. It's great to be able to open the fridge, press a lever and have nice cold great-tasting water come out. I work full-time, so I'm only using it in the morning, evening, and weekends. With that schedule, I need to fill this up about every 2-3 days.I think taste is going to vary widely by region, but I like this better than water right from the tap."
1,Waste of money,"In the beginning it worked fine, but after 3 weeks water was not getting filtered. It's damn frustrating. Don't waste your money on it."
5,high recommend this,"I am a happy customer. I chose this dispenser after doing quite a bit of comparison based on reviews here on Amazon.com. I am SO grateful with my choice! The water tastes pure, it's slim design fits great in my fridge and doesn't take up too much space, and I love how much money I'm saving not having to buy bottled water. I can afford to use delicious, clean water for everything now; from cooking to filling up my dogs' water bowl. I highly recommend this product and believe you won't be disappointed if you buy it."
4,Very Good,"Great purifier! Fits in fridge just fine and the spigot is high quality. Just remember that it isn't very large. Between me and my girlfriend, we fill this thing up everyday."
2,"Good design, but faulty spout","The design of the actual product was nice. I liked how slim the pitcher was and it fit into our refrigerator quite nicely, but the issue I had was with the spout. No matter what we tried to do, it always kept leaking. We ended up having to put paper towels into the fridge just to keep it from soaking everything else in there. After a few days of seeing if it would stop, it never did and we decided to return it. We switched to the pouring pitchers, but we stayed with the same brand and it has done well thus far."
1,works well unless the valve sticks open,"Worked great for about a year, now the valve won't close. Result is a big mess and the last Pur filter we buy."
1,use?,"Bought this as a new product and we recieved a opened and used product, even the filter package was open and wet. It seems very gross to me to have had water in this filter while shipping. Who knows how long this thing has been opened and how long ago it was used."
5,Great item,"This is the best filter product i've purchased. It works well, and fits perfectly in the fridge. There are no leaks, and its helped me increase my daily water intake. I even bought it as a gift for my friends because i like it so much."
4,"I love this, and use it frequently","It started when my daughter was born. We had to use formula to supplement the breastmilk and my wife started buying bottled water. This struck me as incredibly wasteful so I bought the Pur dispenser instead.We trust the quality of the water, and it holds enough that you don't have to stop and refill it every other time you use it. We use it for just about everything. Baby bottles, personal drinking water, even the dog's water comes from here.If I were going to change something about it, it might be the lid. I'm not sure what I don't like about it, but it seems a little awkward. I would also like to see one made about twice this size.Short of a built-in system, this is pretty close to ideal though. If mine broke today I would order another."
5,Very Pleased,"I have had my Pur 2 Water Dispenser for about a month now and really love it! It fits nicely on the refrigerator shelf and surprisingly, takes up very little space."
2,QUESTION!,"Hi, May i know why does your water purifier cause so much white flakes in water when boiled?it is quite disturbing. Some websites said that its the minerals in water. or could be due to hard water or sth like that.What should i do?this is only the second month im using it.. can i make a return? and get a refund?im dissastified with the product."
1,"Filter doesn't work, and it's cheaper at Target","I just got this item yesterday in the mail, and the filter was not functioning, so we went to Target and got another filter only to find out that the item was cheaper there than on Amazon... what a waste. It's working with the new filter, but these filters are like $10 anyways, so I don't feel like I got any kind of deal."
1,YUCK,"This dispenser filter does not just remove the unpleasant tastes from tap water, it adds a taste reminiscent of Hygiea water, which I always hated growing up. If you can tell the difference between regular and diet soft drinks then you are a ""taster"" and tasters could find this trade-off unacceptable."
5,Excellent Product,"Our filtered fridge water dispenser (in the door) broke several times and we didn't want to fix it anymore. We started using this and never looked back. Works great, the water tastes great after the filter taste wears off, doesn't leak, easy to fill and fit great on the fridge shelf. Even the little ones get their own water now. Highly recommended!"
5,Great water filter,"Initially I was a bit skeptical about the whole water filter thing. But now, I am very glad that I bought this dispenser. The water that it filters tastes great! I could not believe the difference that it made from regular tap water. Not to mention the filters seem to last for a long time. It's nice having this dispenser in the fridge. I always have cold filtered tap water easily available. The dispenser has a great nozzle by which the water comes out, the whole assembly fits nicely in the fridge, and I can easily see how much water is left inside. My only gripe is the lid. It just sits on top and feels cheap. Not sure what I was expecting with this, but I did think there would be more to it. Overall, buy the dispenser, you won't regret it."
2,broken immediately...,"I followed the instructions and filled it up and everything looked OK to me...a few hours later hubby went to get some water and there is a huge crack down the front of the spout where it says ""PUR"" and you push the tab down to make the water come out...it currently isn't leaking but it is upsetting to me that it came broken and it wasnt something that was noticed until we pushed down on the tab and the two pieces separated...not sure how long it will hold up? Other than that I do like it - it is easy to fill and holds a good bit of water but is still easy to carry..."
1,PUR now puts flouride in the filtered water!!!! No thanks!,"After we purchased this PUR filter to replace our old one, we noticed on the box that it now adds beneficial Flouride to your filtered water. What?! I can't believe that my PUR filtered water now has flouride in it! How can it be clean filtered water if it has chemicals such as flouride in it? I buy PUR filters so I can have clean water without chemicals. Shame on PUR for allowing the flouride industry to make more money with this unnecessary scheme to put it in all of our water supplies."
1,Zero water pitcher is much better!,"This is a piece of junk, and quite frankly, the claim that it ""leaves in beneficial fluoride (an excitotoxin)"" disturbs me. Unfortunately, unless you measure the TDS in the water, you really wouldn't know if it's truly filtered or not. Well, I measured the TDS in my Pur ""filtered"" water and it was sky high compared to Zero Water pitcher, which was 0 AKA pure, clean water. Please don't waste your money and get something better!"
3,OK water flavor,"This dispenser needs to be refilled often with only two infrequent users. The waster flavor is not nearly as good as bottled water, BUT, please be aware this user lives in Santa Barbara CA, where the tap water is the worst anywhere. SO, it may be my experience that the water does not taste that great because the water going in, is horrible.My personal suggestion is if you have horrible tap water, you may be better off paying for bottled water. If your tap water is decent, this dispenser is a better deal than buying bottled water.I hope I've helped! JenniferinSB"
5,Amazing filter,"I had used a pitcher filter before buying this, and I was skeptical at first about buying a large container filter that would stay in the fridge. I had concerns about space and refills. But after using the product for a year now, I love it. It takes up some space in your fridge but it's only like 6"" wide max and stays nicely out of the way near the side of the fridge. Refills were somewhat of a pain, but now I just use another basic pitcher to go from the faucet to the fridge. easy-peasy. Since it has such a large capacity, there's no need to constantly wait for water to filter like with the filter pitchers. And besides, the pitchers really take up just as much space somehow (maybe their shape?). I would recommend this product to anyone who wants filtered water."
4,Glad I bought this!,I have look and read reviews for a water filter for 2 years. I really wanted an under the sink. But the 400 dollars prices was conserning. Then i thought about the mold factor..I am soo glad I bought this. The water is wonderful and really does make coffee taste better. Thank you. Just becareful handling it full. These really could be made a little tougher.
4,Right size for fridge,This product provides fresh tasting filtered water and it's compact design allows for easy storage in your fridge. Only drawbacks are that it is somewhat slow to refill due to the filter process and the cost of replacement filters.
5,Really Works!!,"I purchased because of the good reviews - but was real skeptical - My tapwater discolors the sink and dishes, clogs the coffepot, and tastes/smells bad. This thing works great and is convenient to use."
1,leaky. not worth the money,used it for a couple of days and the tap started leaking. Had to return it.I would not recommend this product.
3,Not bad,"I bought this to keep in the fridge, I liked the idea of this bigger dispenser over the pitcher so I could use the water for cooking and such.On the plus side, it holds plenty of water, is easy to fill, and the water tastes good.The problem came when I positioned it in the fridge so that I could dispense from the shelf. Closing the door on the fridge pushed back the dispense lever. The next time I opened the fridge I had a flood. I am still trying to figure out a way to arrange the shelves and items in the fridge so that I can use this as I intended, for now it is on the counter, functional, but not quite what I wanted."
4,Good water.,Fits perfectly into my refrigerator. There is not a long wait for the water to pass through the filter. I would recommend to all of my friends.
5,Exactly What A Water Filtration System Should Be,"This PUR water filter/dispenser is designed perfectly for the job it does. The filtered water tastes great. My kids like it better than the bottled water we used to get. It has a substantial capacity and is a cinch to keep filled. It carries easily to the sink or can be topped off from a pitcher. Filtration takes 15 minutes or so, but just don't let it run dry and that's never a problem. We refill at the half-way mark. Filters are quick to install and last a reasonable 2-3 months. This product is so right that we got two - one for the fridge for when cold water is a must and one for the counter when room temperature is all you want. The long, narrow shape fits either spot efficiently. This is the one."
5,No Complaints,"This product works great. The filtering is not slow, like some of the reviews I read before buying it. I'm glad I took a chance. The water tastes great and it's already paid for itself by saving us hundreds of dollars on bottled water. It's also a great feeling that I'm not contributing tons of plastic bottles to landfills like before I bought this filter."
4,"Right size, looks good too",This size is super convenient. Easily fits in any corner yet big enough to give double the quantity of water over regular jug kind filters. I use this to store filtered water at room temparture and mix it with cold filtered water with the jug I keep in the fridge.In the first few weeks the water tastes a little funny but then gets better.
2,Leaks.,"I've had this for about 3 months. I don't know exactly when but it started leaking about a month ago. It seems the valve is not able to hold the water pressure. I have tried slightly tilting the switch back and forward to see if there is a ""sweet spot"", but it never completely stops leak. The dripping stops when there is only less than one cup of water left.Other than that, this thing really works. I just pour tap water in, and it removes a lot of the tap-watery taste. Shame about the dripping.So buy this if you want a wet fridge!"
1,Emperor's Clothes,"I tested the water and here's how the filter stacked up against tap and bottled.Tap: 474PUR: 425Bot: 008I carefully followed instructions, even took out the filter and reinstalled it. Results have always been about 8-10% reduction in particulates. I've read other reviews saying the filter was unusably slow - mine is rather fast, so I'm questioning how much it's filtering.Perhaps it takes out the cholorine taste and odors but not much else. I guess I'm looking at a Zero filter now. I tried the Culligan faucet filter and it completely failed. Does anything actually work?"
4,Very good,It is very easy to use. I use it Boston and Boston's awful tasting tab water tastes wonderful with it. Filterin takes some time but it is worth the wait.
1,Does not filter,"Bought this product and followed the instructions for the water filter (ie. soaked it, ran water through it) prior to installing. Unfortunately my filter does not work! All the water sits at the top and never filters to the bottom. Contacted the manufacturer who recommended i soak the filter again. It did not work. Do not buy this product!"
2,Does not change water taste,Based on the description and some reviews I was hopeful that this would actually make the water taste like bottled water. It did not. Water tastes just as bad as the tap water.It did drain fairly quickly so I gave it 2 stars for that.
4,best,it works very well and i would recommend this product to others.This is convenient as you need not lift a pitchereverytime to drink a glass of water.
4,Great Water,"I purposely searched out Pur water filters instead of buying Brita from my local Target because the flavor is all around better. Water filtered by Pur water filters have less of an after-taste and the texture is less ""hard"". Plus the larger pitcher is great for someone like me who drinks alot of water"
5,as good as expected,"clean great tasting water, took all the nastiness out of the tap water without removing all the flavor. I think it may even taste better than bottled spring water from the grocery store."
4,PUR Water Dispenser,"PUR makes a good product, that's why we purchased the dispenser and filters. PUR Customer Service, however, is sorely lacking. I've contacted PUR with questions in the past and have never received responses from them. It's doubtful that we will continue to purchase PUR because of poor customer service, but it still doesn't diminish the quality of their dispenser or the filters. Because these items were shipped by AMAZON, we received them ahead of schedule and in perfect condition."
5,A Keeper!,"This is my second one. My first one, that I had for years, got dropped and broke beyond repair. I could not find one like it in the stores. I found on Amazon and ordered immediately. This is the perfect size for my counter top. It holds lots of water and tastes really good. I love this and it is one of the items I will never be without. I am so glad I could find it. Other sizes and configuations do not compare to this model. Plus, Amazon is fast on shipping and has great prices. A win-win!"
3,Change of Pace,"In an attempt to be environmentally correct (lol), I stopped using bottled water. Therefore, I began use of a faucet-attached water purifier (i.e., Brita). However; after finding it extremely difficulty to use mechanism necessary to change water flow to purified water, decided to try pitcher dispenser. I found it easier to use and am pleased; in spite of the length of time it takes to refill. Believe that my best bet is to purchase another as lots of water is used in my home."
1,Dirt not in filter but the faucet,"I am writing this review after 6 months of use. I was very happy with the product for months, until one day I took it out of the dishwasher and happened to look closely near the faucet area. There is a thin gap between the plastic around the water faucet and there was so much dirt collected in around. The worst part is that there is no way you can get those dirt particles out- can't put your finger or wipe to clean it. I thought I was protecting my family from the lead, but the basic germs and bacteria were thriving near the faucet. I never noticed this dirt before because I never looked that closely. Thank God I did. Never buying this particular product again."
5,"Use it every day, no complaints.","Everyone that comes over agrees that the water from this thing tastes fantastic, and I love not having to fill it up often. Just replaced the filter at the 2 month mark and everything is working as it should, no complaints."
2,PUR 18 Cup Dispenser,After three fill ups with this pitcher the filtration time began slowing down we've had it one month and the water takes days now to complete the filtration.
2,Started leaking just after its warranty got over,It was working good for at least 6 months. But the tap started leaking now. If you plan to use this product for more than 6 months...then good luck.
5,perfect for me,"I really love the handiness of this water filter. Not only can it hold a LOT of water, but you don't have to wait for it to filter out before you flip the switch to get some. And you don't have to pick up the whole thing to get some either. All parts are sturdy, especially the dispenser."
5,Great product,"I haven't had any issues with this water filter, works great and makes my water taste wonderful. It has also helped me drink more water since I stick in in my fridge & the crisp taste is also ice cold."
4,Overall Great Product,This filter works very well. We live in town and the water tastes terrible so we bought this filter and it takes all of the chlorine taste out of the water. It filters very well. One time it seemed to stop filtering but started working again in a couple hours and has worked perfectly since. I would purchase it again.
5,Bought this for work,"Rather than investing in a water cooler and dealing with water deliveries, we bought this for use at our office of about 8 people. It holds quite a bit (we fill it every morning), does not take up a lot of room in the fridge, and the filtering system works beautifully. The dispenser is much easier for everyone wanting to fill their water bottles up. Nice item"
4,Exactly Right,"May be too large for a refridgerator but perfect for counter top. Certainly improved the taste of my water and consequently, drink alot more water. Less sugar and caffein and it's free. Amazing water."
1,MONEY WASTED!!,SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS BIG TIME!! Bought this from amazon. The filter clogged after a week itself!!!!! Takes more than 2 days to refill. A WASTE OF MONEY. DON'T BUY!!!! DON'T BUY!!!! DON'T BUY!!!! DON'T BUY!!!! DON'T BUY!!!! DON'T BUY!!!! DON'T BUY!!!! DON'T BUY!!!! DON'T BUY!!!! DON'T BUY!!!! DON'T BUY!!!! DON'T BUY!!!! DON'T BUY!!!! DON'T BUY!!!!
2,Great Water - Horrible Filters,The water is clean and tastes great but the filter is horrible. After a week of operations the rate of water filtration is extremely low. I have to plan on filling up the container before going to bed to have the water filtered and ready by morning.That is not an acceptable product. The Brita I have filters extremely fast.
2,Just doesnt cut it for me,"The taste of the water is not very good takes up a good portion of room in your fridge even more if its smaller, the cost of the replacement filters is the worst part, I don't feel they are worth anywhere near 20$ and you have to replace them constantly, which can add up. Overall its just not a good dispenser if your looking to drink good tasting water and saving money."
2,Ppm= same before and after,"I have a water ppm meter, for those who don't know what this is it is a ""parts per million"" meter that measures how many particles are in the water and how conductive it is. I took a reading of my water before = 250ppm and then after using the pur 2 system and the ppm actually jumped to 270ppm. This doesn't filter any of the particles in the water. It didn't do anything essentially, if anything it made the water dirtier."
2,Is it safe?,"Just bought two Pur water pitchers but, they are made from polycarbonate and probably contain BPA. Sent emails two PUR requesting info but they won't answer."
2,"Nice water, but big flaw is the filter - lasted 2weeks","Let me start by saying the water it produces is nice, also the size of the tank is excellent too otherwise it would have got 1*.I got this to use for our kids formula and also for us to drink since our tap water is horrible, this fixes the taste and so we were initially very pleased. However, after exactly 2 weeks,the filter is working excruciatingly slowly. I read other reviews elsewhere on amazon and discovered that this is common. Last night I filled the tank and 9hours later it's only half filtered. When we bought this, it would have taken maybe 10minutes which is fine. There's n way we've got through 40gallons of water in 2 weeks, s it can't be that the filter needs replacing, it's simply a poor design"
2,Consistent defective filters,I've had this unit for a year. The design is good but I have had problems with the quality control of the filters. For the last four months I have been noticing filters that have water in them and they don't last as long as they should (2.5-3 months). I suspect Pur may be intentionally using up some of the filters to make people by them sooner. When they work it does a good job of removing chlorine. At this point I don't think the filters are worth the hassle so unless you absolutely need this shape go with a different one.
4,PUR DS-1800Z,The PUR water dispenser has worked to my satisfaction for over a month now and I love how it has changed my undrinkable tap water in to cold refreshing clean tasteless water. It definitely has done its job and I like it better than a pitcher for the amount it holds and filters at a time. Good for making a pot of coffee or having multiple people drinking from it without draining it completely. Just remember to refill it once you use it as it take a few minutes to run through the filter. I was afraid that the spigot would be really cheap but seems to be holding up just fine. Overall a very nice product.
2,PUR DS-1800Z 2-Stage Water Dispenser,Noticed the water started tasting funny and when I went to change the filter I saw it was cracked. Has potential but should be a little thicker material. Pitcher version works fine.
5,Water filter,"I bought this because the local water was not as good as I wanted.My morning cup of coffee is much more enjoyable now.If you are wanting better tasting water - NO TASTE - get one, you will be glad that you did."
3,Loved it but it started leaking!,"I loved this - I started drinking more water and it tasted great. We have terrible tasting city water but this took care of the horrible taste beautifully. It was a perfect fit in the fridge and so convenient, but after 2 1/2 months it started leaking out in the refrigerator. I had it happen twice and both times it was full of water and leaked the entire basin of water out! What a mess!! I discovered a crack in the bottom of the basin, so there was no fix. Unfortunately warranty expired after 1 month so I'm stuck buying another one or going without. Without the leaking problem this would have been a different 5 star product."
1,Water leaks outside the filter,"I don't know what's going on at the QA department of PUR. I properly mounted the filter in the dispenser but unfiltered tap water leaks from the water reservoir into the main dispenser. Doesn't do what it's supposed to, which leaves me with a one star rating for the item."
1,can not take it apart after using it-----really stuck,I HAVE HAD IT FOR AT LEAST A YEAR. I HAVE NO WAY OF TELLING IF IT REALLY WORKS.I PURCHASED ANOTHER ONE FOR THE LAST TIME. NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRIEDI AM UNABLE TO TAKE IT APART BECAUSE IT IS REALLY STUCK.
2,Doesn't fit neatly into my SubZero refrigerator.,"If you want to put it on a shelf in your SubZero and have the dispenser spout handy at the front edge of the shelf, it won't work. You can't close the refrigerator door because the door shelves bump into it. The description of this product should include measurements of height, depth and width."
1,Filter took 6+ hours to fill dispenser,"This dispenser/filter seemed to be great at first, but within a couple of weeks, the filter slowed down to a crawl. Eventually, it took more than SIX HOURS to filter a full container of water! We found ourselves drinking our horrible-tasting tap water as a result. :-( We tried to put in new filters three times, but eventually each filter slowed down to an unacceptable speed, too. We ended up buying the Brita dispenser instead and threw this one out."
1,NOT GOOD AT ALL - BUY A BRITA,"I recently purchased this picture for my office, along with a 4 pack of filters.I have literally used 4 filters in 5 weeks - after 10 days water will not flow through the filter.I called PUR and received the typical call center rep in a foreign country.She offered to give me a coupon for 1 free filter and then said they would send another coupon for a buy on get one free.The rep told me it was my water's fault I filter NYC tap water)I would recommend you purchase a Brita and avoid the PUR system."
3,it's a ok product.,it's an ok product. I used the water tester to test the water and it didn't even get close to zero. so i just returned it. I basically want pure water and nothing else. I didn't want any additives in the water besides pure water. that's the whole point of filter.
4,Totally got rid of bad taste!!,"My tap water tasted pretty bad, I didn't even want to drink it. When this filter unit arrived, I rinsed the filter, installed it, and enjoyed a glass of clear, delicious water 2 minutes later!! Very satisfied!!"
5,money saver,"A replacement filter is no longer available for my fridge, so I have been purchasing the 2.5 gallon jugs of spring water, which usually would last a week. My sister told me about this Pur dispenser. I have been using it for a month now and love it. In another month, it will pay for itself. I now use filtered water to make tea, gatorade, and coffee. My county water now taste like it came from a spring."
1,A Pur Rip Off,After only 2 WEEKS the water just sits at the top of the dispenser! I have water which is of a high standard so I KNOW there's something wrong with the filter! Will have to return this product and switch to another brand. Disappointing!!!!!!! Good looks that don't last.
4,"Great filter, just SLOW","I bought this pitcher for our summer lake place to help filter the well water. I like the size/shape of the dispenser, fits perfect in our smaller than normal refrigerator. Also holds a ton of water. It does a great job filtering out bad tastes. The only reason I couldn't give this product 5 stars is the very very slow rate of filtering. Seems like it takes days for water to completely filter!"
3,water taste bad after time,we have well water and if u let the water sit in a cup or glass after a while it taste funny. EVEN after Using this fiter system. thinking of switching over to Zero water but im debating on it because they say its better to have high PH so u dont get cancer this is where zero water might be bad
5,Better than we expected,"The water is always crisp and cold and no more lugging big bottles home from the store. We often end up filling up the container two or three times a day, now that we drink water indiscriminately (since it's ""free""). The container is lightweight enough that it's no problem carrying from the sink to the fridge. The water moves through the filter in minutes. Now that I know this system works and we all like it (even the dog--tap water isn't good enough for him now!) I'll be ordering 3 or 4 new filters for the rest of the year.One tiny complaint--we've noticed one slow drip from the spout just as we close the refrigerator door. Unfortunately that drop goes right into our vegetable drawer.Finally one question--is this container made out of that ""bad"" plastic? I hope not..."
5,Love this filter!,"We purchased this about a month ago. Our water has a strong taste of chlorine along with small particulates (you can see a build up in our toilet bowl after a week or so), probably due to old pipes in the town. We leave this filter on our counter and use it for all our drinking and cooking water. We find that size is right, it's easy to use, filters a few liters in about 15 minutes. Water tastes great, makes a huge difference in the taste of coffee and in other beverages, including mixed drinks with ice. We refill after each large use or every morning and have not run out of clean water yet. The spigot is great; spring loaded handle, easy to use, doesn't leak. Highly recomended."
5,Great,"I saw some pretty whiny reviews here, but decided to get it anyways and judge for myself.I'm very glad I did.It holds quite a bit of water and yes, it does take 1 and 1/2 fills in the top to completely fill the bottom.. but who cares? If the top was bigger than the bottom, we would have less water to drink!It filters perfectly and it tastes amazing. The entire unit sits perfectly in my fridge, and all I have to do is slide it forward a few inches and remove the top.. I can fill it still in the fridge so I always have cold water!I had an initial problem with leakage, which was easily fixed.. my fridge door was hitting the water lever.I think its a great solution!It is quality made (its not that cheap plastic..) and I found the water lever to be very sturdy and well made.I ordered one for my mother as a gift.Easy way to get ice cold water!"
5,Good Looking Dispenser,"This PUR Water dispenser looks sleek. Put it on your counter top and enjoy delicious and pure water. Nowadays, many homes have a refrigerator that can dispense purified/filtered and Chilled water as well as Crushed Ice. My home has such a refrigerator too. But this dispenser is used by my wife, who cannot drink chilled water right out of the fridge."
2,"Good dispenser, but the filter didn't work much!","I love the pitcher and the size of dispenser, I live in Pennsylvania and the water tastes really bad in state college, but using the filtered water it tastes clean and when I boil water to make tea there is no sediments in it anymore, however the filter didn't work much for us, it didn't work even for one month, and after 20 days I still see the sediments in my tea, so may be it doesn't worth to buy one filter every 20 days!"
5,Great!,"Fits perfectly in our fridge, makes our nasty tasting faucet water taste like bottled water. There's four people in my house who use it so we do have to fill it every other day/every day the majority of the time. One uses it for her coffee maker.. that might make a difference! Love itt."
4,Happy,"We are very happy with the PUR Dispenser, we have no need to buy spring water anymore. My only complaint is that I wish it was twice as big."
4,Nice product,This water dispenser is easier to use than I thought it would be. I am happy that is fits right into my frig and is easily moved to the sink to refill as needed. The water tastes good and so far I have not experienced any leaks or problems.
4,Like it,"I have had it for about a month now. My husband and I enjoy it. I live in the Southwest and the taste of the water here is horrible. The only thing you should be careful with is the placement of the filter in your fridge. If you don't push it back all the way on the shelf, then you will have a big mess everywhere."
5,good,"the filter seems to work well and do what it should. Our tap water is a bit metallic tasting. After passing it thru this system it comes out tasting clean and fresh. The unit fits nicely on a refrigerator shelf, and comes out nice and cold."
5,Serves the Purpose,"Would actually serves the purpose of removing any unwanted things like taste, odor and others from the water."
4,Works as promissed,"The first one arrived with the lid cracked. Amazon was great with this, they shipped a replacement over night and all I had to do was print a shipping label from their website and take it to the nearest UPS store (I could have arranged a pickup also).The filter works as promised. The water definitely tastes different, which is a good thing. I didn't realize how much crap I was drinking along with my water before. I am giving 4 stars, just because the container's material is not the best. It is very thin and brittle as proved by the cracked lid I got with my first one. A good thing is that I do not have to take the container out the fridge that often, only for re-filling. Overall it works perfect (5 stars), for construction I would give 3 stars."
5,it is good,"shipped on time. wonderful tasting clean water. i have major pain issues and i need to drink almost a gallon of water every day and even though it may filter a little slower than some other pitchers, there are no leaks, and i have no question that the water i am drinking now is improving my pain and life in a way i couldn't achieve with tap water nor afford with one of the systems available for hundreds of dollars. Amazon and Pur... great combination! order yours today! you won't regret it!!"
2,Nerochina,It would have been nice if they stated that it does not filter fluoride. It is only when you read the manual that it states that. I had already open and used the product when I notice the funny taste. I went back to using my zero water filter.
4,PUR Water Dispenser,Enjoying this product. Only regret it isn't larger. Really need two to avoid having to do daily fill up due to its constant useage. I use it for both cooking and drinking water.
4,PRETTY GOOD!,The water tastes sooo much cleaner. I wish it could hold more water though and faster filtration rate...but nothing is perfect.
4,Good product.,"I'm happy with this product. I already had the pitcher and I'm constantly filling it. So, I got this for the fridge to keep cold filtered water and I still use the pitch on the counter for room temperature filtered water.The dispenser sits snugly on the fridge self and it's bin great and convenient.Instead of pulling out the dispenser to fill it, I use a pitcher to fill it as needed right in the fridge. It's much easier than trying to put a heavy dispenser filled with water back on the self. The fridge is just a few steps from the sink and I don't wait till it's empty to refill it. so now, I constantly have cold filtered water.Ever since, I brought my first Pur pitcher I've bin happy with them and I'm happy they changed the design of the filters. Now, I don't have to keep on trying to find the different filters because they now match both the dispenser and the pitcher."
5,Pur 2 stage Water Dispenser,I used to be a die hard Brita fan but the water coming out of this filter system tastes much better. I also like the fact that it is cheaper than Brita and takes out more chemicals and bacteria than Brita. Amazon and Lowes have some of the best prices out there. I have a dispenser and a pitcher and that does well for a family of four. It takes about as much time between the Brita and Pur to filter the water but you have to follow the instructions on soaking a new filter and rinsing it out at the beginning or else it will be really slow. I am very satisfied with these easy filters.
5,Slim and Attractive,"We keep this on the kitchen counter and it gets a lot of use. Our new Keurig coffee maker suggests using filtered water in it, so we fill and use our PUR water filter several timee a day. The dispensing spout doesn't leak or drip. We are very happy with our purchase."
3,Slow filtering,When filling this pitcher it takes over 45 minutes for the water to get into the bottom container. I emailed Kaz and they said it takes 20+ minutes. The water is good. I drink a pitcher a day. I just don't like how slow it is to filter the water.
5,Best tasting pure water,"5-Stars all the way. I love this water purifier and dispenser by PUR. it fits perfectly in my refrigerator and turns tap water into clean, fresh tasting water. It arrived very nicely packaged and in perfect condition. I am extremely happy with this product and recommend it without hesitation."
5,awesome!,"We use this ALL the time. It holds a lot of water, it's convenient and fits right on our refrigerator shelf."
4,Works well. Happy with this filter.,I have been using this filter for 3 months now. It gives a good clean taste to tap water. The build is sturdy.I wish it was bigger in size though it holds almost enough water to fill a 2L bottle.
5,I like it!,Bought this for my dorm room because the tap water tasted horrible. Been using it for about two months now and is probably the best thing I bought since coming to college. Filtering takes some time but the nasty taste goes away so it works well.
5,Love it!,Really works as advertised. Easy to fill; takes up only a slim part of the refrigerator shelf; spigot works until the very end; water seems crystal clear.
4,Excellent. Gets the chlorine out of the water.,"The water here in Houston has a very chlorine taste to it. This gets that out quickly and easily.Also, I use it to add water to the coffee maker, and it seems to keep down on the mineral build up.I like it."
3,Nice and big but harder to use than smaller ones.,I liked the idea of a purifier that could hold this much water but pushing the lever and refilling it gets to be a pain compared to the small pitcher sized ones.
5,Great water dispenser,"I bought this on the recommendation of a friend and I am very happy I did. Capacity is good, the spigot is easy to use and placed low enough so most of the water can be drained, and you can access the filtered water even while the top reservoir still has water in it. My one complaint is that the filters are pricier than Brita's."
4,Works well,"Works well, good capacity. It's a little difficult to fill, however. It needs to be removed from the frig first because of height."
5,WATER DESPNSER,"GREAT VALUE,FOR THE MONEY. HAVE HAD OURS FOR 3 1/2 YEARS. DON'T KNOW HOW MANY FILTERS WE HAVE USED. BUT A LOT DUE TO OUR HIGH MINERAL WATER"
4,good system,"The container fits nicely on the top shelf in my fridge and filters the water perfectly. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the construction isn't as durable as I would've liked, i.e., the lid is light-weight plastic and easily falls off and the spout for dispensing feels very flimsy, like it might break if grabbed too hard (though to date I haven't had a problem with it)."
4,Good filter,Water tastes better than previously used britta. It does require frequent refilling...but not as much as old pitcher style. So I can pour filtered water into old pitcher and have that much more usable water.
4,liking the Pur water Pitcher,liking the pitcher very much-have it right on the countertop-drinking more water now and using the filtered water for my Keurig. i set it up on a makeshift stand to use it easier...would be nice to have a 'matching' PUR stand
5,This is awesome,"I just purchased this water dispenser. How did I live without it? I absolutely love it. The water comes out at a great stream so you don't leave refrigerator door open for a long time. Love the color, size, and capacity. I don't let it empty. I fill it up and keep extra water in the well so as I empty, it fills. I will never be without this dispenser. I drink much more water now that it is cold! I definitely recommend."
2,"Sorry , mine leaked !","I loved the filter system and the size of the dispenser worked very well. However the dispenser tap leaked into my refrigerator . I tried several differant ways of using it , but it always leaked a slow drip and I would have a little puddle of water in between each use . I loved the clean taste of the water and everthing else , but sent it back due to the leakage . I might try the pitcher once I get my refund back ."
1,Why is this so popular???!,"I bought this because compared to all the rest of the pitchers/dispensers that filter water this had 800 reviews at 4.7 stars which meant this thing must be great!!Unfortunately it did not go to well for anyone in my family or friends taste wise and for some reason mine had a steady drip for a few seconds after someone poured themselves a glass of water as well. The only good thing about this is the amount of water it holds and that is pretty much about it because even the plastic is super thin and cheap.I packed it up and returned it for a refund; I would definitely never buy this again nor recommend it!EDIT: I ordered myself an XL Mavea pitcher and although it does not hold near as much water as this did, the water tastes great and no leaks."
3,Slower than Molasses in January!!,"Great filter, looks good, slim but holds a good amount of water. No bad taste. After about a week the filter started to slow, so it would take up to 24 hours for the reservoir to empty completely!! It's a pain, we just try to regularly add water. I try to think it's moving so slow because it's filtering through so much muck in the water. We had to replace the filter after a month or so, then it was back to speedy filtering. Good water...annoying, though."
1,Don't waste your money,I purchased the PUR DS-1800Z 2 Stage Water Dispenser. I had read other reviews before making the purchase and they seemed to be OK. There were complaints about how slowly the unit filtered the water but I didn't experience that problem - until after the 3rd fill up. The lower holding tank filled about 2/3 of the way and then the water stopped filtering. The only explanation can be that the filter is faulty. I'll contact the mfg (the filter is warrantied for 30 days) and see if they will send me one at no charge. If they won't then I will return the product to Amazon for a full refund and never buy PUR Products again.
1,Stupid lever causes water leeks,"I leave mine in the fridge. When I use it I have to pull the dispenser forward so I can draw water. After I use it I have to remember to push the dispenser back far enough to the rear of the fridge, otherwise when I close the door, it leans on the lever. I forgot once already after doing it before on accident. I found all the water on the bottom of the fridge. To dispense water you pull the lever down. If you push it it water simply drips. I wish that the lever would not allow water to drip out unless it is purposely pulled down. So I had to break ice and vacuum my fridge twice. This is a pretty bad flaw in my opinion. It would be better if you can draw water without moving it back and forth."
2,VERY SLOW FILTERING,I BOUGHT MY TANK AND TWO WEEKS LATER THE FILTER IS FILTERING VERY SLOWLY. I DONT KNWO WHAT HAPPENED. NOW IT TAKES FOREVER. I DONT KNOW IF I SHOULD EVEN BOTHER PURCHASING MORE FILTERS..I LOVED IT AT FIRST BUT NOW ITS A PAIN IN MY BACK TO WATCH IT FILTER SO SLOW. ANYONE HAVING THIS PROBLEM?
3,Works.....But cartridges can't be recycled,"There is no information on the Pur website about how to recycle their cartridges. Brita offers recycling in the UK but not in the U.S.. These companies need to take responsibilty for their products and offer consumers a responsible alternative to throwing cartridges in the trash. Unless a recycling program is offered soon, I don't see myself using Pur (or Brita) products in the future."
1,great item - if you want a lake in your fridge,This item leaked. immediately upon first use. in less than an hour more than half the water was on the bottom of my fridge.
5,Love it,"This dispenser produces great tasting quality water, conveniently designed but has one flaw doesn't fill all the way up when refilling."
2,PUR Dispenser,"The dispenser itself is nice, and worked very well for a couple weeks. But after a month, it began to filter VERY slowly. I do have NYC city water, so that may have something to do with it, but the filter seems to run out way too fast and replacements are quite expensive."
5,Pur DS-1800Z 2-stage water dilter dispenser,"Easy to use, fits well in our side by side fridge. filling it is just a matter of learning how, but is well worth the time. once you get used to the schedule of filling it ( with us just two use it ) so its a night time before bed job that assures us of fresh clean tasting, cold water the next morning.Our city water lines here are really bad on this street and the tap water tastes bad even though the City has a so called state of the art filtration plant. This Pur water filter makes our water taste as good as any bottled water we have ever tried. So far since our purchase about (4-5 weeks ago) we have almost saved the amount of its cost by not buying bottled water at $4.95 a case of 24 16.9 ounce bottles. WOULD RECCOMEND IT 100%........"
5,Love it!,"I've always been a bottled water drinker and never really liked the taste of filtered water, but I love this! In 2 weeks it's more than paid for itself! This design fits perfectly on the fridge shelf and holds a pretty good amount of water. The filters are also a little cheaper than the Brita filters."
5,Excellent Product,"This dispenser is awesome. It completely eliminates any odor from tap water, and gives you just pure plain water. Water tastes great, no more odor. It is big enough for me that I only need to refill it every two days. The dispenser looks quite durable and high quality. Overall, it is an excellent product; I will definitely buy it again."
4,"Great water filter, but the water filtering process is a bit slow.","This water filter is *almost* perfect.Pros:-Holds a large amount of water.-The skinny and long design keeps the container large while not using up too much space in the refrigerator.-Filters are not ridiculously expensive if you know where to look, and they last long-The spigot can control the water flow and holds itself down if you don't have a free hand.-The spigot never leaksCons:-The water filtering does take a bit long, and you have to fill up the blue section with water again to you want the fill the entire dispenser up-Once the amount of water gets low, its almost impossible to get out water without tilting it downward.-The handle in the back can make taking the dispenser out of the fridge a challenge, especially if it is heavy with water.Overall, this was a great purchase. I have a feeling this water dispenser will last me a long time."
3,"Decent product, but watch your grip!","So first off, this is my third unit. Clearly I keep going back to this particular model. Mostly its because the filters are so pricey if I have some in the cupboard I don't want to switch to a different model.Pros:Easily cleanable (believe me you should do this every time you change the filter)Filters are easy to changeFits in the fridge without taking up too much spaceCons:Slipperier than a greased eel after you've filled it in the sink.Cracks easily when loaded up with waterI think you see where this is going. Just make sure you hold on to it when filling it up."
3,Willowbrook,"Maybe some people would like to know some of the specifics of Willowbrook? If so, this book might provide some insight into the movement called deinstitutionalization."
3,entertaining crime novel,"This is a high-interest, easy-reading commercial crime novel with a hint of romantic tension, some nice mob atmosphere and a gruesome act of revenge that ties everything up.The disconcerting narrative style has the authors speak in the first person at times, to reinforce the plot with anecdotes from their personal experiences. Stranger still are second-person segments in which the reader is admonished (""you should always.."").Those quirks aside, this is a pretty fun read."
3,"Enjoyable, But Not Great","This was an enjoyable story told from the point of view of a mob guy and an FBI agent. Each chapter alternated between these points of view. I think the reason why it only was worth three stars, however, was due to the fact that it was too realistic. As a result, many parts of the book were tedious--just like real life. I like my fiction ""over the top."" It has to be very exciting for me to really like it. While this book certainly had exciting parts--mob hits, etc., much of the book seemed very mundane.This was certainly not a bad book, but it could have been better."
4,Eye-Popping 3-D Bulletin Boards,"When I ordered this, I did not realize that it is geared towards church bulletin boards. I thought about sending it back for a refund, but after I looked through it, I realized that it was an excellent resource of ideas and information. I am keeping this book and I know that I can use the examples and tips for any school environment. It is an excellent book to help pep up bulletin boards. Higly recommended!"
1,more college kids ambitions than actual case histories,"I had hoped to find a series of studies detailing how small business's developed over a period of years including what success they enjoyed and what problems they incurred along the way. Instead this book seems to be based on kids who want to open restaurants or travel agents or internet services without any real background in the industry and naively go out looking for venture capital, or worse ask their parents for 100,000 dollars. Not nearly enough detail was provided about how the busineses developed or whether they succeeded. I'd have gotten the same information reading a lot of MBA thesis. (or is that what this publication actually is!)"
3,"Good for students, average for early entrepreneurs","I think it's good material for students, but if you already have entrepreneurial thoughts and have begun solving the initial problems, try talking to someone more experienced, the book wont be a great help."
2,catalani fans only,"This is an interesting, youthful work, but horribly sung--what a shame. Only for die-hard fans of the under-rated composer Catalani."
1,Pre verismo opera,"Short interesting opera, only 42 minutes in length. The best part is the 12 minute overture. The Ukranian orchestra plays very well under the comitted leadership of Silvano Frontalini. Then at track 2 the performance falls to pieces, mainly because of the inadquacy of the soprano, Paola Romano, who has a voice with as wide and ugly a vibrato as you can imagine. Only recomended to students of opera."
2,Very Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this DVD. I thought he would take you through a step-by-step process in making a shirt. Instead, it was more like a refreshers course on some of the key elements to making certains parts of the shirt. I didn't feel at all as if he was talking to someone who had never made a shirt before, but someone who has perhaps not made one in a while and only needed to be refreshed. I will never buy any of his products again. This DVD was definitely for the more advanced sewer."
5,Wow very interesting,"this book has Helped Me understand some of the things My Father { Control Officer Capt Dennis R Scanlan} did over there. My Father Before He Passed away told Me some of the same type of stories that I read Here, But it was good to get details. Thanks Stephen for this wonderfully written book .. James"
1,Beware - this book will tell your child that there is no Easter Bunny!!!!,"I bought this book to read to my 3 children for Easter. Luckily, my oldest, who is 8 got hold of the book before I could read it to his younger siblings. He took me aside and told me: ""Mum, you don't want to show this book to my brother and sister. It will tell them that there is no Easter Bunny."" He just about prevented disaster!!!!! What was the author thinking?! You write a picture book aimed at the preschool/elementary school age group and then you put a whopper like that in there?! Without any warning to the parents? I mean - hello?! What was that author thinking?!!!"
1,I hate this book.,"This review contains spoilers and is for adults only.Have absolutely no doubt that the author of this book does not believe in the Easter Bunny and in this book she explicitly tells readers that there is no Easter Bunny. Why Scholastic markets it to the K-2 market is beyond me. This book stinks. Our daughter's teacher read it to the 2nd graders and it caused much anger, confusion and sadness - for both kids and parents. The damage could not be undone.If I could give negative stars, I would. Worst ""kids"" book ever."
1,Poor support and design,"The unit sounds decent, but although it's rated for 55w/channel peak, it's only 17w RMS. The display lighing is extremely bright, and cannot be dimmed. In my car it's so bright it illuminates the headliner of my car and on a dark road can ruin my night vision if I look at it for more than a glance. When the faceplate folds down, it directs the light straight into my eyes (1998 Dodge Neon). I contacted e-mail tech support to see if there was any way to dim it, and received an unintelligable broken english reply:""Thank you for your e-mail. Please be advice that we don't have a dimmer to dinner this don't on this model.""Also note that the included wiring harness uses 20 guage aluminum wire, so even if it does put out the 220w rated it probably can't output it through the wiring provided.Avoid this unit. I'd avoid the entire brand considering the design flaws I saw when installing and using the unit."
1,Very poor quality,For $25.00 I didn't expect hight quality glasses but I thought they would be better then a $5.-$10. pair of readers. I only used these four or five times and a very tiny screw popped out and the lens fell out. I live on the east coast and there on the west so shipping would not be worth it to send them back. I got a better pair of readers at the local mall for $5. and they have a much better case. Very unhappy X Customer.
3,Runs small.,Seems to run narrow in its width. I have a small face but it is a little tight on the width. Otherwise they are confortable.
4,Makes her laugh!!,"My daughter received this for Christmas 2004 and has a wonderful time with all the activities. She is now 22 months and still laughs when the monkey splashes and the roller car flies down the ramp. She doesn't always play with other Little People sets like she does with this one. This is GREAT. One note for future reference, make sure you have other people to fit into the rides as this only comes with two (there are spaces for six total). We have not experienced any malfunctions with pieces coming apart or breaking as reported with other reviewers, only the flag- but I'm sure that is for safety's sake that it is removeable."
3,Surprise Sounds Fun Park,The Little People are slowly taking over our household. We wouldn't keep buying them if they weren't so cute and entertaining. The Surprise Sounds Fun Park hasn't let us down! My son loves playing with the roller coaster. He learned quickly how to set the monkey on the top and push a car down the roller coaster to make the monkey fall. The entire toy is very easy to use for small hands but not too simple that kids will get bored with it quickly. The only frustrating part of the toy is that the swing needs to be pushed rather hard to turn. I definately would recommend this toy to other parents.
3,It's OK,"We got this on sale [...] (reg. list price [...] ) at Target (as a Target exclusive). It's ok for a Little People set; however my 18 month old prefers her farm set. The set up was very easy and we had no trouble there. The car does occasionally jump the tracks, but no more than expected. Also, it would have been nice to get more accessories or people with the set (it came with a girl, a clown and car, and a ticket boy. Overall, for [...] this set was worth the cost but to date it is selling for [...] (ridiculous) and it really is not that cool. Maybe when my daughter gets a bit older she will like it more."
3,"Kid Friendly, but not Adult Friendly","I got this as a gift for my 3 year old daughter. However, it was terribly difficult to put together. I was afraid I was going to break it. When I did put it together (sort of), the car kept on falling off the track when me or my daughter used it. She enjoys it immensely, but since older children are playing with it, I would think FP would have made it more durable."
3,Fun but be careful with the swinging star,"I just gave this to my 2 year old daughter a few days ago. So far she is really enjoying playing but do watch how your child plays with this. Mine liked to guide the car down the ramp by hand and she pushes it manually through the arch with the swinging star. When she tries to draw her hand back, the star catches her hand. The harder she pulls, the harder the star digs into her hand! By the time I realized what was happening and pushed her hand forward again so I could relieve the pressure and lift the star for her, her hand was so jammed in that it was a little hard to push it forward. I don't think she was hurt -- only whimpering and she resumed playing immediately -- but a little startling/scary for me! I didn't realize (until I came and looked at the description here) that this set was for 3 and up. Thought all of the Little People stuff was geared for toddlers! Maybe this is why FP allowed the star to work like this."
3,Get the farm instead,"Although this is a fun toy, my daughter lost interest after a while. Also, the car would often flip off the track before getting to the end. Although I our family loves all of the Little People toys, I would recommend the farm or garage/car wash over this one."
3,Great toy-Bad ramp!,"My 2 year old LOVES Little People's stuff, and this one is no different except for the fact that the ramp keeps coming apart! She gets so annoyed at it that I had to tape it together! Otherwise, a good product!"
3,Almost Good,More like 2 1/2 stars in each catagory. I recently bought this to add to the enormous collection of little people toys my son already has. I think he has somewhere in the neighborhood of 100 Little People alone. I have many of the playsets and this is one of the mediocre sets. As with similar merry-go-round toys from FP the Little People end up in the dog food dish when my son cranks it up. Fllinnggg! I don't know if its possible to put an eye out with a little person but my son is unusually strong for his age and gets a certain joy out of watching things fly that were not meant to. If they can hit me in the face then.. I suppose they could hit him too. I need to be especially attentive when he has this toy out in the livingroom.
2,i expected more...,"i expected more from luciano. this is one of his recent albums. unfortunately, his talent seems not to have gotten better with age. the songs do not fit well with each other. in addition, the album does not have enough roots flava. one song, another moses, actually sticks out for me. there is too much computer generated experimentations on this albums."
5,Canny interpretations of Woody Guthrie,"These songs, and Joel Rafael's interpretations, reflect thoughtful and insightful engagement with Woody Guthrie's material. It is impossible to recapture Woody's style, and the Joel Rafael band wisely doesn't try to do that. Rather, they bring a fresh, clear-toned richness to the songs. Except for the Billy Bragg compositions, the songs are indelibly familiar to many listeners in their original bare-bones recordings. And, though there have been countless covers of some of these numbers, Rafael has chosen well, and brought a few less well-known songs into the mix. In all, this is a collection well worth having (along with the other volume--it's a two-volume set) for people who like to follow the permutations of Woody's music in every generation of interpreters."
1,power supply cord hell,"power cord for this LTV193W is impossible to find even from the manufacturer. you are in for a shock when your power cord goes out. and i am sure that it will, just you wait."
2,Numerous screen problems,"I purchased this item from Best Buy in Dec. of '05. Shortly after purchase, we noticed faint vertical lines across the screen. Six months after this, we started having problems with ""blue screen"". We would lose all picture, but still have sound. It is now making horizontal lines across the picture and the picture jumps up and down around the screen uncontrollably, as if we need to adjust the horizontal hold. VERY ANNOYING!! Folks at Best Buy haven't exactly been helpful fixing the problem, either. They plug it in for a few hours, and if it doesn't act up, they say 'there's nothing we can do about it'. I believe we got a 'lemon'."
3,Good picture / horrible speaker,"I'm happy with the picture quality for a kitchen tv. Features and setup were good as well. I needed one that was under 16"" tall to fit under the cabinets, and this one fit the bill at 15"".As far as sound, the tinny speakers are horrible. Everyone noticed them immediately. They sound like a $10.00 portable radio from the 60's. Fortunatley, it does have a line out plug and the cheap computer speakers I plugged in were a huge improvement.I'm happy with it for what it is. But come on guys, spend an extra $2.50 and upgrade the internal speakers!"
1,Save your money do not buy Westinghouse,I purschased one from Bestbuy the screen died after 1 month. Best buy repaired it. It died again 6 months later. I took it to a tv repair shop the repair would have cost more than the tv. Note: I have a co-worker who also had a Westinghouse tv different model same problem
1,Do NOT Buy Westinghouse TVs!!! EVER!!,"I bought this TV in June 2006. The picture (and all inputs) died in July 2007 (after 13 months). There is absolutely NO recourse--this is now garbage. Replacing the video panel is more expensive than buying a new TV, what with having to ship it back to Westinghouse (even Best Buy ships them there for repair). And there are no independent repair shops in this entire area who can get Westinghouse parts, though the video panel is so expensive, it wouldn't be worth it anyway.If you can afford to pay for these and have them only work for 12-18 months, then Westinghouse is the brand for you. If, on the other hand, you expect at least a couple years of use, buy something else."
1,WORST TOY EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this toy is the worst toy ever! i got it for my birthday and the camera is horrible! the journal is so short,i ran out of room in 2 days!!!!!!!! anyone who says this is a good toy, they better check it again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Undercover Girl Secret Camera Journal,Purchased for a 10 year old girl to take to a 10 year old girl's birthday party sleepover. It was a huge success! Everyone wanted one. Don't know how durable or how long it will last.
3,Good looking fishies....but Could have been better....,"This could have been a great movie ...a 8/10 but ended up a 6.5/10 movie.There seems to be some continuity problems in which i would blame the directorand the editor. But for what it is, we have great looking hungry fishies, lotsof blood and gore and a whole bunch of wiggling half naked teenagers doing whatthey do best... Lots of nudity and fishies helped saved this movie. The lakelocation they have choosen is a great one...green water and great sourroundings.And because we dont have too many flesh eating fish movies...this one should bea keeper."
1,Ashamed that I saw it.,"I just watched this movie and am still in a bit of shock. It is unbelievably awful! I should have read the reviews. Based on the cast and movie description I thought it would be a bit campy, but it was just obscenely terrible. The only purpose/ plot I can possibly assign to this piece of crap is a showcase for gratuitous violence and gore. 32 people gave this movie five stars! Unlike this movie, that is truly frightening."
2,Sucked!,"There's not to much else to say about this movie other than it really sucked. The 3D wasn't all that great and the CGI piranha looked horrible. The acting wasn't all that great either. Good I hope Piranha 3DD has a little more to offer, but by the looks of the trailer I strongly doubt it."
2,Hire this first !!!!,"Yer, I love the Grindhouse type b-grade movies but my suggestion is hire this one before you consider purchasing your own copy.I wanted to throw the ""Porn Director"" into the water myself !!! Some of the worst acting I have experienced, and while I know that the emphasis of these types of films is more so the visual than the acting, surly some reasonable acting would not be too much to expect ?If bikini/nudity for no real reason is your thing then you might enjoy about 20 minutes of this film.I am sure their is a target audience that will love this film, but my suggestion is hire this or watch your friends copy and then decide if you are in that audience ...."
2,director alejandre aja should be ashamed,"this movie is a blatant rip off of the syfy channel's greatest original movie, ""SPRING BREAK SHARK ATTACK"". just change sharks to piranha and add some naked young chicks with giant fake water balloons and maybe no one will notice. there's some laughs and some good gore in this one but i'll take the syfy channel original. i think it's something about being original. maybe it's just me."
3,"This is What Its Named ""Piranha""!","This movie is no better, no worse. It's a Spring break party gone mad with prehistoric piranha. Pretty girls and lots of decent up-to-date gory effects. If you like this kind of movie, get it... if you don't, don't rent or buy."
2,These Fish Have No Bite,"The film begins with Richard Dreyfuss bass fishing at Lake Victoria singing a seafaring ditty an obvious reference to ""Jaws"". It ends with a shock straight out of ""Deep Blue Sea"". That's about as witty as this film gets. My friend Doug said this was the perfect guy flick. I don't know about you Doug but I don't like to see a gaggle of hard bodied babes turned into fish food. I'd say that if I was of an adolescent mindset it delivers the requisite T & A and blood and guts. The high point for me was Ving Rhames fruitlessly trying to fend off the aquatic carnavores with an outboard motor. Elisabeth Shue it's good to see you again. Loved you in ""Adventures in Babysitting"" and ""Leaving Las Vegas"". You probably took off to raise a family but did you have to come back in chum like this?"
2,Fairly Sucks,"When good movie screen actors act for ""just the money"" they can stoop pretty low. The ""Piranha"" movie had somebodies money invested in it, plenty of great talent but no great acting, plenty of high end sets, but a pretty weak story line.Lots of large bosums, skillfully bloodied but what's the point?Stupid movie. Nothing to see here people, just move on."
3,Good campy fun,"An ancient form of the piranha thought to be extinct emerges in a lake in the midst of Spring Break. A bloodbath ensues in this campy horror film. Plenty of skin is shown in this one, and the violence is not too difficult to digest."
1,"another retarded, feeble and pathetic remake.","not even 3d and large amounts of gore can save this dog's excrement of a remake. this remake is a major let down and a disappointment. there is almost no real plot, the little plot that it has is rather feeble and resembles an american pie movie plot. the acting is rather atrocious, even by horror movie standards. the cgi effects are pathetic , the piranhas look fake and are quite laughable. for those who want to see this movie just for full frontal nudity , you will be extremely disappointed as hollywood has once again lied .regarding the underwater nude scene , the actresses's genitals have been digitaly aire-brushed and hidden .( how pathetic). it would seem that hollywood is content with showing graphic violence and endless profanity but full frontal nudity is forbidden. even the low budged original is better than this junk."
1,Should be X-Rated,"3-D effects were wasted on this movie. The movies should be X-Rated, it is not even good science fictions it was a big mistake to buy this movie"
2,Movie is a joke!,"I bought the movie to see the 3D visual effects. Although that part passed with flying colors, the movie content is foul-mouthed and full of nudity. A waste of my time and money."
1,"Poor 3d effects, not worth the price","This has a few named actors but the plot is weak and I thought the 3-D effects were terrible and would never recommend this movie to anyone. They had to add token nudity in order to attract people to buy this. The movie itself could have been made much better with a little work but they went for the violence that didn't help improve the movie in my opinion. Lots of gory scenes but not realistic. Still there were a few good moments, just nor enough to make it worthwhile."
3,Otherwise fun and darkly funny picture undone by too much gore and grue,"This looked like a good one for me . Lot of actors (Shue , Rhames , O'Connell , Lloyd , Dreyfuss) approximately my age . Lots of beautiful young women doing wild things . A director i like . A setting i liked . Lots of things appealed to me . Too much carnage and killing though . Too much killing shown . Too bad , because my old , kinda husky self was diggin' the proceedings . I'm certain it was all meant to be darkly funny ? That wore off though and it just got gross . Perhaps i'm getting too long in the tooth ? Seemed like too much of a gnarly thing to these eyes . i've seen a lot of gnarly as of late and it's gettin' kinda stale . There's more than one way to scare a cat ."
5,it delivers,"simple as that. it promises nudity, gore and killer fish and delivers every single minute of the film. One of my top guilty pleasures of the year.jimmy palmiotti"
3,i dont know,the movie work ok except it went slow and froze some times. and the special features were really slow and froze some times as wellPiranha
4,3D Review by a 3D Connoisseur,"POST-PRODUCTION 3D (converted from 2D to 3D)My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D, not the video content.There are over 15 out of screen effects that extend 10% of the way, from the screen to the viewer. Another 7 neared 25%. At 25 minutes a boat anchor at 40%, 30:00 coral at 35%, 57:45 a cord whips to 40%, and at 66:50, up to 50%, a motor-slicing fish-flying 30 second scene.This movie contains Blood, Skin, Gore and Nudity.*** Nicely Done For A Post Production (FAKE) 3D Film . ***MY 3D RATING = VERY GOOD (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different. What I see at 25% you may see at 15% or 35%. To fully realize how far something is out of the screen for you, pause on an effect and direct a partner with an extended finger to the tip of what you are seeing. You may be surprised.Click on `See all my reviews' for the lowdown on other 3Ds"
3,This movie is Exactly what you think it is...,"This movie is Exactly what you think it is... no better, no worse. It's a spring break party gone mad with prehistoric piranha. Pretty girls and lots of decent up-to-date gory effects. If you like this kind of movie, get it... if you don't, don't. No surprises here."
1,Piranha (Blu-ray 3D),That was the worst movie I have ever seen.I think I will use the DVD as a target.It does NOT rate even 1 star.
1,UTTER RUBBISH IN THE WORST WAY,"Well from the start i had high hopes for this film not having heard any reviews from anybody about the movie. I have seen the original and that was ok with the whole genetics thing but this, oh my gosh what crap they where down in a river below a river, over the time period of five million years thats said they have been down that hole in the earth, should they not have evolved into fish that are more adepet at attacks at night, but not these guys and if the mommys and daddy where huge how come there where so many young ones evolution would deem that the stronger eat the lesser so the bigger would be more abundent but dont let me stop you from buying or renting this rubbish movie cause everything ive typed you will still want to see what im talking about"
1,Failed Attempt,"Sigh. This film left me feeling a little violated. It was embarrassing seeing teenagers portrayed this way. I wish I had read more of the reviews on this film. I guess I was thinking about the Roger Corman version. Not thinking it would be the exact style of his film, but at least a good story line.Here's another movie degrading women. All the ways these girls were killed was disgusting. Exposing their body parts up close and in full nudity or partial nudity was distasteful and sleezy.Also seeing a man's private part being eaten by the piranha was sickening. That part snuck up on me before I could fast forward the movie. Did not see that coming, because I was looking at the movie on and off while I was typing. What a pathetic pervert to add that in.Some will still watch it to make their own judgement. If these people are going to butcher classics, then don't. Some movies are just made to remain classics."
2,"Piranah has a goofy, slightly-sleazy-but-not-too-sleazy charm","Exploitation remake of an exploitation movie. Lots of gore. Lots of nudity. Lots of actors who are better than the material. And in 3D - but poor 3D - which creates some odd looking shots. The underwater 3D inCreature From the Black Lagoonwas much better than this. Despite the flaws, the movie has a goofy, slightly-sleazy-but-not-too-sleazy charm and I enjoyed it well enough."
5,Greatest movie ever?,Is this the greatest movie ever made? Maybe. I guess Citizen Kane is better but Piranha 3D is up there. It is pure cinematic genius. Aja is a gift to the film world.He has redeemed himself fully for the awful insult called Mirrors.
4,Review of 3D content,"This movie looks really good in 3D throughout. It was fun to watch this movie with that little extra you get when viewing in 3D. Lots of naked people throughout, but it didn't take away from the fish LOL. Enjoy."
4,"Funny, campy horror.","The movie itself is right up my alley. Disc arrived with some minor scratches, but played fine with no skipping."
4,piranha,"Thanks fun movie,nice to see them get eaten the porn set it off good the fish are big and mean"
1,PORNOGRAPHY!?,"This is not the type of movie that would be brought out at Christmas, Thanksgiving or when the ""folks"" are coming over. This is something that would be viewed late at night with the ""guys,"" cigars and booze.Call some of us prudes, call us anything you wish. It will not change the fact that this particular movie is for ONE definite group.Amazon should have a warning on the product page stating that the content ""could be offensive to some.""My copy was immediately sold at Amazon, and this is my second review written in the last 3 days.Interesting, that the original was included immediately and gone 2 days later.We're told (see to your right) to ""be detailed and specific"" ... but be careful not to say anything that might indicate that Amazon did anything wrong.If you really want to see what this ""masterpiece"" is all about, read the other reviews."
4,Amazing Story,"The Promise is an amazing story about an amazing woman. Not that Oral Lee Brown would call herself that. But anyone reading her book has to be impressed by her self-sacrifice, determination and accomplishment in saving enough money to put 23 children through college. Had it been twenty three children she was related to that would have been impressive enough. But to visit a class of inner city Oakland first graders, prmoise to put the entire class through college and then follow up on her promiose all while making $43,000 ayear makes for fascinating reading. It is also interesting to learn about the individul chidlren's personalities, the schools they chose and the Foundation Mrs. Brown started. It is no wonder that newspapers around the country and even Oprah have chsen to also tell Mrs. Brown's story. But in thisbook the reader get te tale from Oral Lee Brown firsthand, in her own words. I makes onebelieve that nthing is possble."
3,Some memories,"I have to admit, I'm a sucker for almost anything Renaissance Records puts out, so it was only a matter of time before I bought this cd just on the basis of their hit, Magic, which I definitely liked when it came out. There were a few sons I liked here, but for the most part I don't remember any of these songs. On the whole I didn't like the album, so I guess I'm just not a fan of Pilot. That said, this is a good representative collection spanning their whole career, so if you liked Pilot and want a compilation of their music, so you won't need to drag out the old vinyl every time you want to hear them, don't hesitate to pick it up. We ALL need to support Renaissance Records because they are the champions at bringing back the B list bands we all remember and can't find anywhere. Your one hit wonders and persistent multi-album side-liners are all here. BUY THEM!"
4,Jicks are legit,"Pavement fans will love the sounds from the Wowee Zowee and Brighten the Corners eras many of the songs on this album evoke. Fans of Malkmus' first solo realease will crave the luscious velvety ear candy in ""Vanessa From Queens"" and ""Animal Midnight"". The Jicks show they are more than just a back up band with their harmonies in songs like ""Us"". Malkmus shows he can continue to innovate while staying true to his roots with this release. Be sure to purchase soon so you can get the Limited Edition with the Bonus CD, as it contains the best song of the new crop, ""Dynamic Calories""."
3,He can do better,"Yeah, Vanessa from Queens is good and so are a few other songs on this album. However, Malkmus used to write albums on level with the Beatles White Album. Now his appeal has changed. He's more of the indie rock Jimmy Page now. Also, the Jicks in my opinion lack all of the charisma and presence that used to make Pavement great. Bob, Steve, Scott, Garry, and Mark were brilliant. I don't know though if you like really good guitar playing, and long guitar solos this album might be a 4 to 5 star CD for you."
3,Thinking man's rock,"3 1/2There are a few spectacularly off-kilter gems on the former Pavement frontman's solo sophomore, but even the steady rate of introspective rock can't elevate every track past self-conscious composition."
3,Hmmm... yea.,"I can't bear to say anything bad about our saviour of the almight lord Pavement. So I'll just say... this album is enjoyable and... adequate. Stephen's quirky lyrics turn songs like ""Do Not Feed the Oyster"" into songs that Velcro to the side of your head... candles like ""Dark Wave"" light the windows of our indie homes... but are not the blazing torches of the glory years. Worth picking up, but make no mistake; there is no ""Zurich is $tained"" in sight."
3,In Retrospect,"No, this album is nowhere near as good as his first solo album. The first one was fun, free and loose. This album is dangerously close to sounding too-thought-out and claustrophobic. It's not as fun, not as spontaneous. In fact, I like the more throwaway type songs on the bonus EP more than the ones on this LP.Hopefully SM will lighten up for his third."
2,goofiness abounds,"6 good songs here on this collection of filler material. Heres whats worthy: track 2,3,4, 11 on the first disk, track 1,2 on the second. Thats right, many skips and much space between the good stuff. If anyone can find anything interesting on the tracks I havent listed, email me and lets talk but I can tell you, you are wrong. SM's first solo venture was wonderful and now we get this, a return to the worst of Pavement days Wowie Zowie and Brighten the Corners style garbatio."
2,Milk-toast Malkmus,"I was terrifically disappointed by this album. Malkmus in his Pavement heydey (and even in flashes on his first solo lp [black book]) summoned a wild poetry with glimpses of anger, despair and razor irony. I think the mossy, latte',healthy-hippy vibe of Portland is mellowing Malkmus into a well-read Jacob Dylan. And how 'bout that band?!!! They are simply not good. The beats and bass-lines are simplistic. The Jicks simply don't rock."
3,Battery Carger for Canon CA-PS400 Batteries,Charger is okay and does the job. The power cord is extremely stiff which make portability undesirable. Hard to coil up the power cord. I do recommend the charger as you can charge two batteries at the same time which is necessary if you are a pro or serious amateur. I do not recommend using any after-market charger or batteries for top quality Canon cameras. Stick with the Canon products for you Canon cameras.
2,Not worth it,Bought it because it said both batteries charged simultaneously. It doesn't. Gave it 2 stars because at least you don't have to go back and switch between charges.
5,West Point Maps,"If you are a true military historian, you love maps. I have used the West Point maps from their web site for years but finally got the spiral bound book. It is great to read history with the map by your side to understand the terrain features that frequently determined the battle outcome. Highly recommended by a retired general."
1,wow...,"First of all let me just say what a read!!! this book is extremely accurate and scientiffic in it's approach to this very fasinating and extremely important subject!!!!!!personally i dont care that the author used to be a nazi and was the man responsable for the nazi march in skokie.Forgiveness!and lastly so what if he is jewish? im so sick of hearing people bring that upalso it shouldnt matter that he was convicted of molesting some boys, that has nothing to with atlantis so BACK OFF!!!Reviews should be about the product itself and not the person behind them!!!so in short you should buy this book because it is hands down the most exclusive book about Atlantis written to date!!oops, I accidentally gave it one star... how do I change it?"
1,intelectual garbage,"I managed to read half of this book before putting it in the trash. Than I discovered that the author ""Francis Joseph Collin"" used to be the nazi leader hwo originally planned the Skokie nazi march. Highly recomended for new-age flakes."
1,misled,"The picture of this product showed a roller water kit for a skilsaw. However, when it arrived, it only included the water attachment. About $10 dollars worth of parts for $40 dollars. Quite the ripoff and very misleading. One star because you can't give zero."
5,Dream Freedom,"I really liked this book and I would reccomend it to people who like realilistic fiction. This book was about how there is still slavery in Sudan, Africa. It is also about this class in America who raises enough money to buy back some of the slaves. It has a lot of different narrarators, such as the slaves, Marcus, one of the students, the guy who buys back the slaves, and familys who have been ruined because people took away their family. This book by Sonja Leviton was the best book I have read in along time. It is so touching and it makes you notice about other people's struggles.-H.H"
4,Not a light read,"I'm not an anthropology major and i had to re-read sections to fully understand. I needed this book for a class and this book is a lot of information. I talked to some people who didn't like the fact that key terms and concepts aren't highlighted (which didn't really bother me) although some of the theories and concepts are drawn or illustrated in the pages. Overall, I like this book but it's definitely geared towards anthropology majors."
2,Bad Graphics,My Child found the graphics to be so poor that they were disturbing. My child could figure out what happened to Winnie's red shirt. The graphic style is different and the characters don't resemble the common rendering of Pooh and his friends. There is not much difference between this and any other pop-up Book.
2,Way too noisy,"Cute train, but it's really big so you need some space around your tree. The worst thing is the noise (not the music, just the noise it makes when it works). It is so unbearable we decided to return it although our kids love it."
1,Built for a midget,This thing is a joke. It is about 6 inches to narrow and way to short for any support. Don't buy unless your 4 foot tall.
4,My cutest kelly doll giftset,I think that if a child buys one of these they should be at least 5years old.It is such a beutiful doll-set.Nothing ever falls of orbreaks.And the people who makes does a great job.Dorthy Gale looksjust like she did in the movie.I highly reccomend this doll toanybody.
3,They're OK Pens,"Pros:It writes smoothly onto the paperYour writing looks very niceCons:Once you write in the front of the paper, you can't write in the back of it because it's difficult to read what you wrote.....but that's expected from a fountain pen!Overally, I like this pen, and would recommend it.UPDATE FEB 2011: I've noticed that some of the pens leak as you're writing and that's just horrible. Not all the pens do that, but it makes me feel like I wasted money, so I have taken my 5 star review and it is now a 3."
3,Not for taking notes in class,"I can't say I enjoy writing with these as much as my other fountain pens. I tend to use fountain pens to write notes in class with, since they are more fluid than a standard pen. Since they bleed on the other side of the paper, I can't really use them for that purpose."
4,"Vibrant writing, but ink causes some issues","These pens write beautifully and smoothly, almost like fine-tipped markers. I wrote a thank-you note, and the recipients thought perhaps I had printed the words on the card somehow! No, it was just careful handwriting combined with a vibrant pink fountain pen.I have a few complaints; not enough to make me regret the purchase, though. 1. Sometimes after writing I have the ink smeared on my hands, from touching the top of the nib on accident. 2. The ink bleeds through most paper. 3. The most common colors (i.e. blue, purple, black) only lasted me a month and a half with daily use.This pack of disposable fountain pens would make a great gift for artists, scrapbookers, or anyone who appreciates fine writing instruments."
3,"They are nice, but the ink looks the same as roller balls and it is runny.","I get it on my fingers without noticing, and the ink isn't different than a a G2 rollerball pen or the like. It comes with the basic three colors (BLK, R, B) and 4 others (sea foam green, lavander, hot pink, light blue) so there's variety. Other than that, they aren't precise and not really good for drawing dive the bleed so much. They are meh."
5,What a Great Idea!,"Let me first tell you that I really like fountain pens - When I saw this item I ordered 4 sets. I have used all the different ink colors and the pens write beautifully, like an expensive fountain pen. I expect to have to re-order in another 30 days.This is a don't miss item!"
5,"Good product, good price, great value",The title says it all! It's great to still be able to find these type of pens in so many colors and at such a great value. You will be sorry if you don't buy more than one set.
5,Excellent disposal fountain pens,"I wish that some of my $300 to $500 fountain pens had a nib this smooth and easy to write with. I hate to carry an expensive fountain pen to work because someone is always asking to borrow it, and most people cannot use one correctly. Enter the Pilot Varsity. These sturdy little fountain pens have excellent nibs and, if some idiot borrows it and bangs the nib into the desk, I'm not out an arm and a leg. Comfortable and a pleasure to use."
2,Not a Fountain Pen!,These pens look like fountain pens but still have a ball on the end like a ball point pen and works like a heavy flow pen.If you are looking for a crisp clean writing pen that produces sharp edges and swirls like a real fountain pen (as I was) these are not for you.if you just want a fancier looking disposable pen with a heavy ink flow then these are great.
4,Another Great Pilot Product,Nutshell Review:ProsWrites easilyGreat ink flowClassy lookConsDisposableBleeds a bit
5,VARSITY DISPOSABLE FOUNTAIN PEN,"I only bought the black one in a local stationary store, but I love using my little fountain pen. It's fun to write with and so inexpensive that I'm not worried about losing it. I've only had one other experience with a cheap fountain pen, and although that one was prettier, it leaked all over everything I owned. Not so with the Varsity. I keep it in my pen case with my other pens, with no worries.The ink is nicely pigmented and, as with fountain pens, there is a short wait time for it to dry once you're done writing. I mainly write in my little composition book (which I use as an art journal) and I keep an extra sheet of binder paper, folded to the size of the journal, which blots the ink when I close my book.Happy writing!"
5,This were great!!,"These pens are really great :) The ink is very vibrant and lovely to see on paper. They're fairly cheap,good quality(a wide tip maybe?)and easy to use-no mess of filling with fountain pen ink.The only bad thing about these pens is the ink is a bit unstable and does smear a bit and does bleed thru on certain kinds of paper. Other than that I really love these pens and colors as does anyone else I write to :)"
3,"Nice colors, ink flows too fast","The pens are comfortable to write with, but the ink flows too quickly. This makes your writing bleed on any paper that's even slightly soft and the pens run dry more quickly than you would expect. The colors are very nice. Overall, this is an okay product, not a great one."
4,So elegant,"I feel so elegant when I use these fountain pens. They don't write quite as nicely as a reusable fountain pen, but I find them to be surprisingly good quality for disposables."
5,Great Pen for writing long hand,I grew up in India using fountain pens. I was overjoyed when I discovered this inexpensive pens. They write beautifully. They last for quite a months. When they the ink gets over. You toss them and use the next one. Its great. I would highly recommend it.
5,Awesome,These pens are awesome! They're really smooth when writing and the many colors are useful. They come in a somewhat small size so they're very portable.
5,Great Pen for the Money,Writes very nicely. Nice ink colors. I love fountain pens as they are fun and different. . . a nice way to stand out with your writing and makes writing a little more fun! :
2,Writes like a cheap gel pen.,"I know I shouldn't expect much from a inexpensive disposable fountain pen, but the disposable Bic fountain pens are much better. I just received these in the mail today and tried them out; there is no variation in the writing, the ink is not reliable, and it bleeds with the slightest hesitation. These are about as expressive as a gel pen. It disappoints me, because I am a huge fan of most pilot writing instruments; However, I will stay away from their disposable fountain pen market."
4,Great for the Price,"I am an avid fountain pen user. I bought this product because I wanted some funky ink colors. It's a great value for the price as the nibs do not clog or skip. However, I prefer a fine nib and these are medium so you will get a much broader pen stroke."
5,Better than most high-end fountain pens!,"I am obsessed with finding the best pens. I have bought many types of fountain pens, even those costing over a hundred dollars in a quest for one that writes smoothly, has the right amount of resistance, distributes ink evenly, and can withstand being transported in a day planner without exploding.These pens meet all my expectations and cost a fraction of others I have bought. They don't look elegant, but that is a small price to pay for a functional fountain pen."
5,"Finally, a non-drip fountain pen!","After over 50 years of having multi-colored hands from leaky fountain pens, I have discovered these wonderful Pilot Varsity Disposable Fountain Pens! What a delight for those of us who only write with fountain pens! And, these pens come in a rainbow of colors. Each pen is very comfortable to use, always writes smoothly, and never needs to be refilled - no more rubber gloves and many bottles of ink. The medium nibs definitely make a statement, and the pens never skip. I know that they also come in packs of all navy blue or black, but I love the bright colors in the assorted pack, which match any card I need to write. Pilot has a pack of winners here!"
4,Fantastic - especially for the price,"Great pens, especially for the price. These actually write better than many fountain pens in the $50 range.The ink is very, very wet though, so it doesn't work well with all papers."
3,Pens,"Nice and simple, easy to work with and easy to part with when they run out of ink. Good for travel and for beginners in calligraphy."
3,"Nice pens, but not what I expected","I got these for my sister because she likes writing, and fountain pens are pretty fancy. I've seen videos of how someone can adjust the thickness of the writing by putting some pressure on it. When I got it for my sister, I tried it out, and it didn't do that. It looked like a fountain pen, but it wrote like a regular pen. It was pretty upsetting because I wanted my sister to play around with calligraphy. The ink does come out a little differently, like a flow, so they are good pens. Just not the kind of pen I thought it would be."
2,Waterman v Varsity,I'll stay with my Waterman with the refill cartridges. Guaranteed the same writing quality and ink delivery time after time.
5,These pens write right.,"My wife loves these fountain pens. They write well, and she can choose a different color without changing an ink cartridge. Buy them in quantity and save on shipping."
2,Not as I thought,The pen is like an ordinary penIt didn't do the writing u want a fountain pen will doI recommend to buy something else
5,I love these!,I wanted more than one but not quite a dozen of them do I got this pack. I don't care about ye various colors as I just use these for taking notes. Best writing pens for the price by far. Just don't loan them out. If they know how to use them you may not getIt back and if they don't it'll likely come back bent and unusable.
5,Used the before...,"If you like fountain pens but don't want to spend the big bucks on *one* pen, these are the ticket! They are awesome and I have purchased them in the past and will purchase them again and again!"
4,Got me hooked on fountain pens,"While I didn't get the multi pack, I did start with these as a fountain pen. I used them all the time because I found that I didn't press down as had and make my hand sore while I was taking notes. After using these for a while, I finally bought a semi-decent fountain and there is a big difference in quality, but these still are great for starting out with a fountain pen. I still have 2 of them and use them sometimes when I dont want to get out my good one (they are in a cup on my desk). Either way, these are a good buy for a person just wanting to try a fountain pen."
5,My favorite pens ever,I love these pens and plan to order more. I always have trouble with fountain pens. The ink dries or it doesn't work right or whatever. I'm fountion pen challenged. But these pens work great every time. One of my new best finds.
5,Incredible Technology!,"I've had two of these pens for well over 10 years. In all of that time, regardless of how long they sat between uses (sometimes more than 2 years) they have always started as if they sat for just 2 minutes. I collect and use fountain pens, many of which cost hundreds more than this pen. Many of these write more smoothly (and many don't), yet these Pilot Varsities remain the champ for writing the first time every time. They are reasonably smooth writers and always flow evenly. Despite being disposable, they have a very large ink supply, more than most rollerball pens that also use water soluble ink. Easily one of the very best buys in a fountain pen...period."
3,Writes Great. Ink doesnt last long.,"Pros : Great colors, Writes smooth and consistent. Didnt have any problem with leaks...Cons : The ink flows so well that it tens to over saturate the paper and bleed easily. Consequently the ink doesnt last long and at over $3 a piece these are overly expensive to replace. A regular pen will last 3-4X longer than one of these.I would not recommend these to anyone other than as a give for someone who wanted to experience a Fountain Pen. They are not practical for everyday use.I had high hopes...."
4,Pilot Varsity Disposable Pens,"These pens write remarkably well for their price. I wish they were refillable, as I hesitate to throw away such a nice instrument. Perhaps I will use the spent pens as dip pens. The balance is exceptional in my hand. I usually remove cps, and of course lose them. The short length of the pens make them comfortable with the caps on."
5,Love the fountain pens!,I was so excited to receive these disposable fountain pens. The variety of colors are wonderful and I just love writing with these pens. Ink flow is perfect and pens last a very long time!
5,Vintage fun in a disposable,"My architect wife loves fountain pens and has to do a great deal of document/drawing markup. Using these she can do it in style. Levenger sells these for 3 X the price, but adds a leather bag to hold them in. I made a wooden box to hold them and she now has a custom markup set that is fun and stylish. The included pouch is more or less just packaging and has little use after you open it. These make a great gift for the writer or artist if you pair it with some sort of container that you buy or make such as a zippered pouch or small box (think used cigar box!)."
5,Watchout fountain pens!,"I got these pens because I wanted to own a fountain pen but couldn't afford to get one at the time, and the great thing is is that with this pack you'll get rainbow colors and as it turned out a great fountain pen experienced. I figured I could try these out and then see if getting a proffessional would be worth the expense.I loved these and I love the colors they come in. Great ink, real fountain pen tip, and fits my college budget. I fell in love. And when the ink ran out (which was a long time, about a semester and I write almost 24/7) I did buy a real fountain pen and splurged on a bottle of Noodlers ink.Pens are worth every cent but I will admit they didn't last long enough for me to consider this a viable option for an avid writer. If you want a long term option (pens that will last as long as your traditional pens) these are not it. This is because pens are disposable and you cannot refil ink. They worked for me though as great sample pens."
4,Seven-pack of multi-coloured ecstasy.,"First, I will say that I had to take off one star because the ink is water-soluble. I took these pens down to the beach to write, and the ink smudged because it took so long to dry, and if anything spills on it, you're hosed.BUT that is the only negative I can possibly think of. They write smoothly and consistently, require no priming, the nibs are smooth and do not catch on paper, the ink flow is exactly perfect for my writing speed, and apparently no amount of rough treatment can get them to leak - they stay in my bag, and they get jostled a lot, but I haven't lost a drop.These are perfect for anyone who loves fountain pens but has a tendency to lose nice ones (like me)."
5,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THESE PENS!!","I absolutely LOVE these pens!They're bold, bright, clean and the envy of my co-workers.I lock them in a drawer each night - had to learn that lesson the hard way."
3,delicate and smudgy,"I ought to first admit I bought these for my 3rd grader who loves to write and draw in pen, and is generally very much more careful and gentle than most 8 year olds are, and she had been writing in fountain pen at school - even so she managed to break a couple of tips right away. If you aren't holding the pen perfectly you will get smudging, and the caps are kind of hard to snap - in fact one was dry when we opened the package. All in all they are a lot cheaper than most others, but maybe that isn't really the way to go if you want to work with fountain pens?"
3,A Golf Ball,"Nothing exceptional in comparison to others I have played. the price is good, the ball average."
1,"TV is NOT a ""treat""","Our 3 year old loved the Reader Rabbit game so much that we got tired of it and bought her JumpStart Advanced Preschool. What a disappointment. None of the activities are as interesting or educational as Reader Rabbit and, worst of all, the player is regularly given a ""treat"", the opportunity to go to the playroom. What is in the playroom? Some drawings of toys (none of which are interactive) and a tv that shows tinny versions of nursery rhymes. So the message is that learning games are ok, but the real treat is watching tv!"
5,50's and 60's review,We so enjoyed the music of Jay & the Americans - this cd wasso crisp and clear. Made us feel like we were back at thesock hops!!! Loved it.
4,Definite Good Fortune,"The day I the amulet arrived at my home, I received word that I had gotten a new job/transfer at my current workplace. The next day when I started wearing it, I received a raise.Switched chains with a Sterling Silver one. Piece is very heavy."
1,Waste of money.,"I purchased this piece, just to see what would happen. I have not had any luck since buying it. It was a waste of money."
4,A Superior Mystery Story,"Written in good, unpretentious prose, this book seems simple at first, but quickly gets the reader involved. The characters are interesting and well developed. The story is interesting and complicated enough to be intriguing. It is very well written and well edited. I prefer the author's style to that of many better known writers."
2,works BUT.....,works BUT there is no cover for when it gets dirty... we used ours for about 2 weeks and then had to throw it away... so for the price i wish it had a cover you could wash...
2,It's pretty ...,"and when I can stand to be on it, it seems to work as intended, but it smells funny, like it had gotten wet and then dried out while in the plastic overwrap. I'm sensitive to molds and mildew so unsure what I'll be able to do with this product in the long run.It DID arrive on time."
3,fashionable neck pillow,"great color choices, fast delivery, and good product for when I take my 15 minute breaks to relax my neck."
2,Not for Airplanes!,I bought these for a long flight to Alaska and was very disappointed. They were too big and uncomfortable to use with the airplane seats/headrests. If you are looking for something to take on the plane - keep looking.
5,Awesome!,I love this pillow. It gives my neck the perfect support to sleep well at night. I don't leave home without it.
5,LOVE THESE PILLOWS,"I LOVE THESE PILLOWS SO MUCH AND CAN'T FIND THEM ANYWHERE. SO, I COULD NOT JUST GET ONE, I HAD TO BUY THREE!! THANK YOU AMAZON!"
5,DogBones Neck Pillow,"My granddaughter wanted a bone pillow like grandma had so I bought her this red bone pillow on Amazon. She called me to say, ""Grandma, I just love my new bone pillow""!"""
4,A great knee pillow!,"I got it to use on an airline trip but the seats recline so slightly on these lousy planes that the pillow pushes the head too far forward. While traveling, however, I discovered that it was a great yoga pillow and I've been using it ever since as an adjustable pillow to hold the knees straight while sleeping. Very comfortable and doesn't slip around like a regular pillow. All around handy item. Best to forget about air travel these days, anyway!"
5,Great travel pillow,"Purchased two of these pillows for me and my daughter to use on a cross country flight, so we wouldn't have to use the airplane pillows. They worked great. I was skeptical because of their odd shape but it proved to be perfect."
2,Not comfortable,I did not find these pillows comfortable for airplane travel. They are too big and bulky to provide any comfort. I guess they would be fine if you were laying on a couch and not sitting mostly upright like on a plane. I would have been better off saving my money and using the airplane pillow. I wouldn't recommend these particular pillows.
1,Too much static--no real communication,"My grandson wanted these walkie talkies, though they had bad reviews on-line. They absolutely do not work---"
1,Awful Buy,"I was so excited when I found this item. My son is completely into super heroes especially wolverine. I normally read reviews on the items I purchase, but this one I just jumped in. BIG mistake! These DO NOT work. All we get is static.....we can hear each other through them when we stand within 2-3 feet of each other and face each other. Don't waste your money!"
3,"Good, but why buy a compilation?","I have known about just about every band on this CD and own just about all of the CD's from them. Some of the tracks on this CD have never been released, so that is a plus... but why buy a compilation?I mean you only get one song from each band. Unless you are only a fan of radio punk (example: Blink 182/ Sum 41/ Green Day) then this is good for you. But if you are like me, and know of most of these bands already, then just go out and get the entire CD of that artist."
5,Atticus dragging the lake II,Very good CD. Lots of good songs that are hard to find. Especially the blink 182 song track 6. Definitely recommend it.
1,Carry around a magnifying glass to use this book,"For all of you over 40 whose eyes are not like those of an eagle (can eagles even read??), this book will make you look like Sherlock Holmes as you use your magnifying glass to navigate the streets of New York City. The type is too little to easily read on the small maps of the city sections inside the book. The index in the back of the book only covers streets so unless you know what you are looking for is in what section of the city, this cumbersome."
5,Break free... no shame.,"If you feel you may have a problem with drinking too much and are ashamed to talk about it, don't be ashamed any more. This book (called 'The Big Book' by AA members) contains the basis for a new life without the crippling cycle of alcohol abuse.There is no more need to hide liquor bottles... lie about your drinking... drink alone... black out for hours... or take just a little morning drink to ease the shakes. Please look in your local white pages under ""Alcoholics Anonymous"" just to find someone to talk to. Or you may email me.It gets much easier from there, I promise."
3,Good Reference Book,"This author assumes that the reader lives in the UK and you happen to know where all the regions are located (I had to keep glancing at the maps). The interesting thing though is that he covers all monarchs from like 100 BC and all regions, but I ended up just skipping all those parts as I couldn't pronounce the names or the places (especially the welsh names how the heck to do you say ""ap"" or is this an abbreviation for something?). Also he covers each one so quickly you can't even get the chronology straight in your head. The book does have good geneological and chronological tables though. ""Brief"" is exactly information the book gives."
2,Beginning Korean,"Excellent content but the Romanization makes the book difficult to use and compromises the text's value. This book could be improved by publishing a version in Hangul/English in the style of ""College Korean"" by Rogers, You, and Richards."
1,Not good for beginners,"My wife and I had a lot of trouble understanding this book. It does not give enough basic rules before starting the lessons, plus it does not use Hangul at all."
5,A Cross-genre Album That You Will Love!!!,"I was *very* pleasantly surprised when I listened to ""Figments."" Studio musicians aren't known for their solo efforts, and fortunately, this record rises above... it's truly a gem!From the gorgeous vocals Brian Wilson added to ""Hand on My Shoulder"" to Ace Frehley's guitar work on ""Know Where You Go"" - there is something about every song that will draw you in and blow you away... A number of the songs feature artists and rhythms from Anton's native South Africa, giving the record a sort of Peter Gabriel vibe. VERY cool.It's nice to see an artist that doesnt make a record where all of the songs sound the same. Anton's collection of songs isn't bound by some artificial limitation like ""rock"" or ""world music"" or ""adult alternative"" - Anton draws upon his vast experience and influences and makes each song special.Anton - please keep making music like this!!"
1,This guy is a drummer?,"I bought this CD because I am a 20+ year KISS fan, and Anton has been Ace Frehley's drummer on solo projects since Ace's first solo album in 1978. I wanted to see what else he was capable of, besides rock and what he does on Letterman. Also, Ace and Sebastian Bach appear on the album.For an album that's supposed to be about a drummer, the tracks display a surprising lack of imagination when it comes to percussion. What's worse, even though there really is no ""theme"" to the album, the Ace/Sebastian song sounds really out of place. Ace's solo is horrible to boot.The only bright spot I can find is the varied vocal talent.Don't buy this album if you are looking for new or exciting percussion."
5,"aches gone, hands clean","This is my favorite topical analgesic, and definately my favorite way to apply it. i carry a stick in my purse, and have one by my bed. using it inthe stick format keeps the hands clean (nothing like scratchiing your eye after applying a pain creme.... hurts like hell!). the pain relief is fast acting. It doesn't stain your clothes. While it does have an odor, I prefer the smell to all others - it smells minty.... and most people (while they can smell it) don't know what it is....the price here is about $1.50 less than my local drugstore.... I highly recommend this produce."
4,Made the Creed relevant for me today,"Marthaler's book was extremely helpful to me in putting the Creed into a context that is relevant for me today. Gender and the Nicene Creed by Elizabeth Geitz, an Episcopal priest, is an excellent companion to it, offering a completely different perspective. Worship is much more meaningful to me now that I have a clearer idea of what the Creed means. Mindless recitation is over for me!"
4,The Creed: The Apostolic Faith in Contemporary Theology,The product was as described and delivery was within timeframe selected.
2,T-E-D-I-O-U-S,"Ugh. I've played for an hour or two and have gotten just past the Dryad village. I doubt I'll play any more (well, I lie. I got the bloody 4-disk thing so I'll probably give it a go a few more times!) because it's so darned TEDIOUS. You have to hold the right-click button down for your guy to attack anything. The other guy may or may not attack. I can't just set auto-characteristics and count on my subsidiary guys to do their thing!And all that talking. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. You don't just get info from people. You have to page through conversations with every Tom, Dick and Dryad you meet. Maybe that's fun for some 13 year-old who wants to get immersed in a ""story"", but it slows the game down way too much for my taste.Good thing I got it for $6 on eBay. (that should have been a clue right there that it isn't what we'd hoped it would be.......)"
2,Great graphics...for 3 years ago.,"My biggest complaint about this game is the use of a dated graphics engine. Even at the very highest settings, textures look terrible, character shapes look blocky, and lighting is marginal at best. One of the biggest annoyances is that character mouths don't move at all while talking. It is hard to get into the game when other games out there, such as NeverWinter Nights, are available and offer much better graphics and non-linear gameplay. This game is okay, but feels like it was produced 3 years ago."
3,Dungeon Siege II,The graphics and the game play were better in previous game. This one can get boring quickly. I stopped playing it with out finishing it.
2,Not impressed,"I'm not impressed with DS2. Perhaps that could be because I haven't played the first one, but I doubt it. I haven't played longer than 30 mins, but what I did play I found boring, tedious and really unpleasant upon the eye. The storyline and script is horribly canned and the visuals are far from stellar - you would think this game was a couple years old. Trying to drop into it, I found the controls very unfamiliar but, as it is with most games, I can see that once you get the format familiarized that should no longer be a problem. The game may get better with time, if so, I will edit my review.This is certainly a game I would not recommend you spend your money on until you find it in the bargain bins."
2,dungeon Siege 2 is bad...,I loved Dungeon Siege 1 so this was a disappointment. The start is difficult and boring in a tree or something. I couldn't finish the game because of a fountain puzzle. The end boss looks too difficult too. It's not very fun in my opinion.
5,Great Sequel,"If you liked the original Dungeon Siege, you are going to love this one. Tons of quests, and a lot of the issues with the first one are addressed in the sequel. If you never have played Dungeon Siege and are interested, there is a downloadable trial version on the Microsoft Games website."
5,The much improved sequel to the original Dungeon Siege,"Those who played the original Dungeon Siege, will greatly be impressed by this sequel. It has more of what made the original great and it has also been imroved and enhanced considirably with lot of good stuff.new:-you can choose from more than one race; human, dryad, elf, half giant.-lot of pets; packmule, scorpion, ice golem, fire golem, pet dragon, etc.-pets evolve and become better and grow up.-enhanced graphics. way better looking than dungeon siege. although the player characters could use a little more work, but still look great.-secondary skills with levels for each character class.-lots of new veriety of animals.-if your video card is 64mb you can play it at good speed with high resolution and full detail. no slowdowns.-high replayibility.-cool soundtrack.-amazing AI.-exceptional visuals.-highly adictive."
1,Fatally Flawed,Dungeon Siege was a neat game. Dungeon Siege II is not. The fatal flaw is having the saved game put you back in the most recent town. You then have to fight your way back to where you left or got killed in the first place. This gets boring. I tried setting a teleport before the fight but it just took me back to the town before I got to fight. I doubt that I will finish the game. Save your money. Very disappointing.
5,Great Series,Dungeon Siege is a favorite game of mine. All of these are great games for everyone. I recommend the series.
3,Missed the Mark,"If the developers were trying to appease devotees of the original Dungeon Siege with this version, they greatly missed the mark. This game wastes too much space on videos and complicated character development. I still enjoy playing the original Dungeon Siege and was hoping this version would provide different worlds and monsters, with essentially the same mechanisms to play the game. The characters in DSII won't even attack a monster unless you right click on it.The developers were on the right track with Legends of Aranna, where they upgraded the original version with new spells and weapons. However, the new realm provided in Aranna was so boring I didn't even complete the game. I'm beginning to wonder if I'll be able to stick it out to completion of this new version, too."
2,Advice: Download the Demo before you buy.,"A lot of the other comments say ""if you liked DS, you'll like DS II."" Well, I liked DS, and I think DS II is a monstrosity. Gone are the clean interface, simplicity, intuitive play, and beautiful art of the original. The DS II interface is cluttered and baroque. It hurts my eyes just to look at it. The characters are astoundingly ugly, the art is too busy, and there are layers and layers of skills, abilities, chants, etc. that contribute nothing except needless confusion. Download the free demo before you make this purchase. If you liked DS because it was beautiful to look at, like I did, you will be turned off of this game before you get past the character selection screen."
3,Does not live up to the first,"I had some pretty high hopes for this game when I picked it up. It disapointed me on almost all levels. The character customization is as bland and pointless as the first. You have to go into options to enable your character to auto defend or attack, and that feature is pretty useless for any melee character.I have had every save game I have attempted to load come up with horrible problems. Half the time, the game no longer recognized I had any save games, and other times, it maintained my characters stats, levels, and items, but removed any of the quests I had completed.The most recent patch (2.2) has removed a few of the bugs, but this game is barely out of BETA stage, and should have had a LOT less problems than it does. I loved DS, and feel horribly let down by this sequal."
4,Dungeon Siege Redux,"If you liked Dungeon Siege, you'll like this too. I think they played it fairly safe in this sequel, expanding the geography and storyline but not changing the gameplay much. There are still situations, even on the easiest setting where you can get killed multiple times getting past an opponent but on the whole it is not oppressively difficult. There are more options for character development than before and a number of optional quests in addition to the primary plot requirements. I like action RPGs with a few mild puzzles so this is a natural for me.Word of advice -- heed the warning about not changing weapon types too much as what you use determines how you develop and a strong focus on a specialty makes for a strong character."
4,"Great, but buggy","Dungeon Siege II is an excellent game. This is a substitute for those that are either sick of or not interested in Diablo II. This game, granted it looks a lot like it, does a lot of things different that prove entertaining.The gameplay is solid, the story is intriguing, and the graphics are above par. The pet system is even an interesting twist.The problem I had with this game was the bugs in the system. My system met all of the requirements up, but I'd still get errors and freezes every half hour to a hour of straight play. It takes some tweaking to delay this, but I haven't been able to 'cleanse' the game fully. Expect a solid game, but with some obstacles along the way. All in all, a good buy if you like Diablo-esque games."
2,DS2,Very disappointed in this game. Perhaps when some good mods are written it will be playable. Spent maybe 2 hours messing with it and gave up.
2,Not an attention grabber,"I have a newer graphics card and I can't say that this game impressed me very much. Even though the monsters were unique-looking, there wasn't any variety in fighting them; you could either hack at them with a blade or cast the same set of weak spells and then hack at them with a blade. The quests were tedious and, needless to say, it didn't hold my attention for long. There are many better games out there for this kind of money so keep looking."
2,Not for high volume usage,"I am a elementary school teacher and this sharpener only lasted me a year and a half. It wont sharpen certain pencils...it eats brand new ones too. It worked well for about 6 months and then after that, it became a hassle."
3,Does the job,"It is a reliable product, but it doesn't have quite the ""grip"" I was looking for. That is, it kind of tugs and tunes the pencil a bit while sharpening."
5,It does mean something,"I found the book riveting as Susan O'Neill, the author shares the profession of nursing in war time and the personal stories in the difficult situation she lived and worked through. Using raw language and raw detail, she shared the experiences many of us have not appreciated or understood. I could not wait to get to the end of each short story to learn the outcome and in doing so I experienced a range of emotions - sadness, humor, anger, disbelief, pride and amazement. The little heard voice of the female military nurse in Vietnam is now in print. This book is a must read to understand the history of the Vietnam War, the important role nursing played and how it affected the nurses who served there."
4,does a great job for the price,I love these headphones. I work in an office with tons of cubes and it does an excellent job of cancelling out the background noises. A co-worker has a pair that cost over $150 and they are not much better than these...
2,Not High Quality,"When the noise canceling is turned on they do work, but they're poor quality and don't withstand consistent use for long. What's interesting is that my Sennheiser HD 280 headphones are able to block out more noise without battery assistance, are higher quality with better sound, and have lasted a lot longer. If you're looking to block out noise I'd go with the Sennheiser 280 cans. If you're looking for great quality sound, I'd recommend the Sennheiser HD 555s (though they're open so no noise blocking whatsoever)."
4,Very good if you are not looking for perfection,"I have used these headphones in my 14 hrs flights to Asia, and the truth is that they cancell most of the annoying noise.Of course you can not compare with some $200+ items, but they are just great for the price."
1,Waste of Money,"To see if noise cancelling headphones really work, I and my friend purchased 4 sets of headphones including the Bose Quiet Comfort 3 and bring them on a flight for a reality test. This pair of Sharper Image headphone cancel only a small portion of ambiance noise while the bigger brothers worked fairly well. No wonder it is on sale.Don't waste your money. Get a pair of Sennheiser, or even better, the Bose. I was surprised a company like Sharper Image which usually has good product totally flopped on this product."
2,don't buy this one if you look for Noise cancellation headphone,"I bought this headphone because I am working on a lab with fans blowing. the headphone does surpress a little of the low frequency noise, but it also introduce a very noticeable noise of different frequency just as annoying as fan. So, if you really look for a noise cancellation headphone, try different one. Maybe the one I got is defective, in either case, I should say the quality control is poor. Overall, I would not recommend this product. Now I am using it as a regular headphone. BTW, the shipping is fast. I can not deny that."
3,Trying to help splitting nails,"I have been using it and it does add a nice shine to my nails, but I have not yet seen an improvement. It may not have been long enough however. If it is only for shine, I can get a less expensive enamel."
3,No so good,I purchased this set for my son about 2 months ago. At first it was great. He loved it and so did I. Now after a couple of months things are starting to go downhill. First the train no longer works and yes we did change the batteries. Also we have the construction truck with remote and the fire engine with remote. When you try to turn them off with the remote sometimes they just keep going and sometimes they will not go at all. Sometimes when you turn on the fire engine remote the fire engine and the construction truck go at the same time. Somewhere the wires are getting crossed. I was very happy when we first purchased this but very disappointed now.
4,Love this toy!,"We got this for my 2-1/2 year old for Christmas and he just loves it. I am really glad I got an extra remote as his cousin can play with him too. There are no fights as they each have their own remote controlled vehicle to operate. It is so easy for them to master the controls. What I also love about it, is they don't need to use the remote controls to have fun. My son loves just pushing the train around the track and doing all the loading of the coal and logs without using the remote. If you want a well constructed fun toy for boys or girls,(my 3 year old niece loves it too)this is the perfect toy. My 10 and 12 year old were even caught playing with it although they would never admit to it. I am looking forward to getting every piece of this set by purchasing one for his easter basket, one for birthday, maybe even valentines day so he can get have the whole set by the end of the year. Thanks Fisher Price for such a Great toy!"
4,Great Train!!!,"Zack my 3 year old got this toy for x-mas and just loves it. I would get this toy again even though there are a few set-backs. The noise on one of the remotes has already went. We will be taking that back this week. Also I found that sometimes the train will keep going or not stop, and I found the cause of it. If you open the batt compartment of the remote the batt are not all the way down like they should be. I'm guessing that with the handling of them the batteries aren't held in tight enough for them to work properly. I just open it up and fix it then they work fine.I don't seem to have the problem that others have about the trains coming off there tracks. I do have the problem that the bridge doesn't say on to well, but it hasn't stopped the trains at all. It may skipp alittle but thats it.Zack loves the train, and even with the little problems we have I would still buy this toy again.."
5,The best train on the market for 3 and older!,My son absolutely loves this train set. He gets up in the mornings and goes right for it on his toy shelf. All other toys are discarded to the side. We both enjoy rearranging the tracks. It is the most versitle toy and the add-ons are terrific. This toy can grow with him and I couldn't be happier with my purchase.
3,Offers great features that don't work,"We just purchased this train set for my son's birthday. We spent the evening assembling the track and we sent it for a trial run. When the train reaches the top of the hill, it decends so quickly that the entire train falls off the track. This is a big disappointment. The train works great as long as you only want to watch it travel around in a flat circle."
4,24 BATTERIES!!!,"Ok, I agree, this is a fun train. We had none of the problems that others had. I snap the bridge on HARD and it stays great. The train stays on the track and all the little accessories are fun. BUT ,and this is a BIG BUT! We bought the entire set which takes 24 BATTERIES to run. And like several others have stated, they(the batteries) last less than a week. So, if you are not the CEO of Duracell or Rayovac, plan on shelling out some dough to keep this thing running. If you are not the kind of people who keep batteries in your house at all times, your kids will get bored with this toy very quickly."
4,Pleasantly pleased,"I had looked at the GeoTrax train system before Christmas for my 4 year old son, but my husband and I felt like it may be a little young for him. Then he received one as a gift for Christmas from a family member, and I am so glad he did! He LOVES trains, and like another review I read, owns tons of Thomas-based wooden train systems, but loves that this train makes sounds and goes on its own. The bridge is a little touchy and does not fit well together, but that is the only down-fall that we've noticed. He pulls it out constantly and is able to build the track on his own. I am now on the look-out for additional track pieces and accessories for his birthday at the end of January!"
3,Unhappy 3 year old,"Well I thought this was going to be a great toy, and bought everything for it for Christmas for my son. Christmas day, the Fire engine train never worked out of the box. The construction train made loud grinding noises and stopped working in less than two weeks. And the train that came with the big set only worked when you shook it hard.How do you explain to a 3 year old why his new toy won't work?(...)"
5,This set is GREAT!!,We got this for our son last Christmas when he was two and a half and he has loved it! We've since added more of the accessories and he will be getting more this Christmas as well. It is so much fun for him to play with. It works great and stays together so well. This is a GREAT toy!
5,Creating geniuses one choo-choo at a time,"My son recieved Geo Trax Rail & Road System last Christmas and has been playing with it daily since then. He was recently tested for his overall intelligence on various levels, and even though he is a three-year-old, his problem solving skills were those of a six-year-old child. I truly believe that his Geo Trax have had a great influence on his accelerated skills. He is always finding ways to make new designs and solving any problems that arise during his play. Also, he can play with it for HOURS- a true rarity for a child of his age. Don't hesitate to get a child in your life this gift...they have fun and learn in ways you would never expect!"
4,Not happy,"I normally like Fisher Price toys and like the other reviewers originally thought it was a great value. I purchased this toy about 3 weeks ago for my 2 1/2 year old son. After setting the whole thing up, we realized the train's power switch wouldn't work. Instead of packing the whole thing up and returning it, we just returned the train. Toys R Us exchanged it with no problem. Then 2 weeks later, the train noises stopped working. I've changed the batteries in both the remote and the train and it still doesn't work. Yes the train set works without the noises, but I expected more from a Fisher Price toy."
4,Great Toy!,"We bought this toy for my son's 2nd birthday. At first he didn't seem to be too interested, so eventually we packed it up and put it away. Then a couple of weeks ago (at 2 1/2) we decided to give it another try and now he loves it! We have bought additional accessories and he loves the construction site and to make the fire engine go thru the fire station. We plan on getting him the elevation series for xmas. He is now old enough to put the track together himself (which he loves) and put the train back on the track. We arer always changing the design and we love to play with him. He has also been inviting his friends over to play and they love crashing their trains and just missing each other. It's durable and great for keeping the little ones happy. The only thing I wish is that the accessorie sites that you buy actually did something mechanical or that the remote control trains went backward as well as forward. All in all it's pretty great!"
3,Nice starter train,"This is a HUGE set! If you are seriously considering this, i reccomend that you get a plastic rubbermaid container to store the pieces in, and if you are going to buy more of it, you may just want to pick up two of them!This is a nice starter train, but in certain layouts, the train comes off of the track. The volume is a little loud, and my son (3) has problems getting the bridge to snap into the mountian part of the track.I was a little bit disapointed in it, and i wish that i would of went with the Thomas or Brio sets, but for now, he has alot of fun with this one.....if only it were not so BIG!"
4,Great Train!!,"My 2 year old got this for Christmas in 2003, he was almost 2. He still plays with it as does his 5 year old brother. We had to add the elevation kit along with some extra trains so everyone, even little 1 1/2 year old sister, could have their own train. The kids love to either control all the cars or each have their own to control. The track can be changed in different ways to add excitement. This is a great train to get and then add on to little by little."
2,wrong toy for my child,"The tracks are very easy to snap together and well-made. The accessories are not as well-made and are too light-weight. They move or fall over too easily while my son is manipulating their parts. At first he likes watching the train, but he gets bored with it pretty fast. He usually wants to push the train on the track himself, and if the cars come off the track he has a hard time getting them properly aligned on the track by himself and gets frustrated. A wooden track with magnetic trains (Thomas or generic) is much more enjoyable for us."
3,Disappointed by this train,"My 2-year-old son received this Geotrax Railroad System for Christmas (December 2003) as a gift. Even though we had trouble with keeping the bridge staying connected, we liked this train set. My husband and I went out and tried to buy the accessories. Most were not available in the stores (this must have been a popular gift this year). We were so disappointed in the pieces we did buy. Unfortunately, most of the accessories are not electronic and literally just sit there. They truly are boring and do not offer much fun for the kids. The train is extremely slow. The basic Geotrax set is okay for kids. The accessories aren't worth the extra money."
4,Very disapointing to a little one,"My son is in love with fire trucks, and fire stations....and trains.He recieved this as a christmas gift, and was disapointed that the train does not run thru it. Yes, you can connect the station to the track, but it is only on one side. IF the train were to run thru it, it could NOT continue its way around the track, because the other side (front of the firestation) has no way to lock a piece of track in. I do not understand how the previous reviewer is locking the pieces in so that her son can run his train thru the station, because even the end pieces do not fit.But just to play with, my son absolutely loves it."
3,Not very pleased!,My son loves trains and we bought him this for christmas to add on to his geotrax train. He was very disappointed that we cannot hook this on to the track to make the train run through the fire station. Very disappointing for a 3 year old!
2,Poorer GeoTrax Accessories,"GeoTrax on the whole is terrific. We currently own about 75% of all the GeoTrax stuff ever offered. While we have spent hundreds of dollars on our son's ""collection"" of GeoTrax stuff, it's really been pretty inexpensive given how much he plays with it.However, I feel this particular accessory was poorly designed because the front of the firehouse can only connect to the rest of the GeoTrax system through the custom crossing track piece that comes with the firehouse. While this, in and of itself, isn't that bad, the design of how the piece of track connects to the fire house is very prone to slipping off when being played with by a 2-3yo.If you're wanting to limit how much money you spend on GeoTrax accessories, I'd spend my money on other GeoTrax accessories."
4,Great but annoying if you misplace the little end piece,This is a great Geotrax addition. My only problem is that we occaisionally have a hard time finding the little end piece. We only have one piece like that in our whole Geotrax collection. I wish that it were a more universal piece. Maybe we just have too many Geotrax. :)
4,MB,The product is of great quality but I order the wrong size. The vendor took care of my return quickly without a hassle.
2,OK... but about it,Extremely poorly packaged.... just in a box with NO packing material. The axel broke through on side as a result.No spoke liner included.Was slightly out of true but tolerable.
2,Sent it back,"While this product may work for many, I returned it for 2 reasons:1) the AM radio reception was very poor. I purchased the unit to combine both the TV with AM radio to listen to a new AM station we enjoy. The radio in the unit was unable to pull in the AM signal. While the signal is weak, other AM radios in the house can pull it in.2) perhaps trival to some, but the remote control did not have a ""previous channel"" button. We enjoy and use that button frequently.In addition to the above, I was surprised to see that the screen ratio was 9:6 so that the 10"" diagonal measurement yielded a pretty small screen."
5,My wife has been very happy...,"With her FDM-1000A. It mounted easily and works as advertised. We listen to the TV mostly and not music but I have not noticed anything ""tinny"" about the speakers. DVDs look very good"
1,DO NOT BUY - USELESS AFTER 9 MONTHS,"We have had this unit for less then 9 months and alreay the LCD screen has burned out and the radio never worked on it. The price was reasonable, wich is why we bought it, but in the end...We should have gone with a more reputable brand.We called Polaroid about the warrenty and they said they would try to fix it for $125 plus the cost of shipping and handling both ways. (Which would end up costing about the same as buying a new one.)Thanks, but no thanks."
1,Terrible Unit,"This tv will work for a short period of time until the screen goes completely black rendering the unit useless only for radio! I only used it maybe 5 hours total and the screen would not turn on, called customer service and they said they've never heard of that problem! Then if i wanted it fixed it would cost me over $100! Are you kidding me! Worst customer service and warranty EVER! DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!"
1,Non repairable junk,My Polaroid unit lasted about 7 months. Then the picture just went out. The warranty was for six months. I couldn't get anyone to fix it so it went in the trash.
5,Norse myth manga rocks!,"Ragnarok is one of the greatest mangas I ever have read! In Norse mythology, Ragnarok is the end of the world. This series is a great insight on Norse mythology. In it, Fenris (like Fenrir, an offspring of Loki in wolf form, that helped cause Ragnarok) is trying to find Baldur's sword. You also meet Chaos and Iris. Chaos is teaching Iris to be more powerful. Eventually (but not in vol. 1), Iris and Chaos meet Fenris, and try to prevent Ragnarok."
5,Good Speakers for the price.,"I bought these at Walmart for about $20. They have a wood case on the subwoofer, very difficult to find at prices this low. I think I've owned them for about 2 years now. Never had any problems with anything. They do have small sound, but they are small, cheap speakers. They work wonderfully on a desk as an accent for a computer, I've used them for media production. As small theater speakers in a bedroom they are a little quiet. But that depends on your volume taste, how loud the rest of your house is, etc. Overall they deliver very good sound for the price. I would pay up $50 for this set."
2,Fiyo too thin,"There are better live performances of Meters and related material out there. This concert seems thin in its sound texture, not very powerful, and generally and uninspired. In contrast, george Porter Jr and the Runnin' Pardners'CD, Things aint what they used to be, is much tighter and energized, and the real horns are great. So get that one if you can find it"
2,What Happend?,"I go to the record store purchase three albums, one of them being ""The Ugly Organ"" by Cursive. I drive home put in The Ugly Organ and within minutes I realize the mistake I have made. This album is horrible. The first three songs on the CD pass by as pure noise as you scramble to figure out what is going on. The rest of the CD plays on very disjointedly and the whole CD sounds like the trans-siberian orchastra. I happen to like concept albums and am a very open minded person when it comes to music but this is simply horrible. The few bright spots are The Recluse but it quickly losses its shine as you play it over and over again, Staying Alive is a very nice song and is the only reason why the cd receives two stars."
5,The Ugly Organ isn't so Ugly,"This album was very good, musically and lyrically. I have to say that it is one of my all-time favorites. The songs range from happy feelings to sad feelings, and tell great stories. One thing for sure, you won't listen to this album and walk away feeling unfulfilled."
2,And you will know us by the trail of hype...,"Well, here it is. The first way overrated release of the year! The songs here are incredibly irritating and the lyrics are as pretentious as they come. If your goal is to collect every ""critically acclaimed"" album that comes out without giving them a second thought, then this album will fit nicely next to your ""Source Tags and Codes"" CD. There is one good song here, ""Bloody Murderer,"" which eventually will find a home on a future mix CD. Wake up and smell the hype."
4,what happened to rock and roll...,"What happened to that Cursive energy? I miss the painful screaming voice... It's more like The Good Life to me than Cursive. But, then again, The Good Life was good and if you're a Cursive fan you should get this CD cause it's still worth it(and they are FABULOUS live!).GO FOR IT! THE LITTLE GUY DISERVES IT..."
5,6 Stars,"Imagine a band so great that it is extraordinary when they play 4/4 time. Or maybe a band that purposely plays/sings incorrectly and not ruin a song. Or a band that is so genius, that they are genius because their lyrics contradict the song by downing it, and claiming that their current lyrics are a cheap stratigy, and a marketing scheme. If you could comprehend that, you probably would like Cursive.Cursive is a band you have to listen to over and over, and ""study"". If you do not understand their genius, you probobly will not like them, or pretend to because you think it is cool to like music that sounds bad. Cursive is without a doubt, the most original band I have ever heard.I suggest their album ""Domestica"". All of their albums blow everything else away, but ""Domestica"" is my favorite. Though their best song, ""Sink to the Beat"" is on ""Burst and Bloom"" Buy this album and support the best band."
4,cello adds but also takes away,"Cursive has done an excellent job at their attempt at a concept album but i must admit there are some flaws. The cello adds a new depth to a lot of their songs and and it is an interesting combination but it seems to slow down the overall energy of the album. There is a lack of catchy simple songs like on their previous albums. Standout songs are ""Some Red Handed Sleight of Hand"", ""Art is Hard"", ""Bloody Murder"" and ""The Recluse"". This is definetally a more mature album but i hope they can learn to be able to cut the cello on some songs."
4,listening pleasure,"i'll admit it-- i bought this cd for one song and that was ""the recluse."" however, it did not take long for me to get hooked on about four other songs on this cd.only complaint about this cd is that for some reason it does not play on my computer and on my early 90s cd boombox. but it plays in my car and on my ps2? don't quite get that."
3,Not bad...,"While this band seemed to be little more than a cross between Fugazi (musically) and the Afghan Whigs (lyrically) on 'Domestica,' they've expanded their sound to include some bouncy new wave, bleeding-heart pop and a whole hell of a lot of cello on 'The Ugly Organ.' I personally think the latter facet of this release gets old; it almost sounds like they went overboard in making the new gal feel at home, since loud guitars have generally been replaced with or overwhelmed by her addition. Kasher's vocals have been strengthened by a few years on the road, which helps the overall sound, and his work in The Good Life has softened yet improved his songwriting. I'd say the 'concept' feel is a little forced and not half as cohesive as on 'Domestica,' but perhaps a lesson Cursive are slowly learning is that great rock records don't NEED to be concept albums."
2,"Should be titled ""Take-Out""","I was hoping for creative meals not based on tofu and beans alone. What this book does is give you a shopping list for foods already prepared (store bought biscuits, bottled dressing, shredded carrots from the salad bar- not kidding- canned apricots, prepared pie crust, washed salad greens, cookies, etc.) I do not buy a cookbook expecting ""recipes"" for ""Coffee Floats with Amaretti Cookies"" that tell me to buy coffee ice cream, amaretti cookies, and strong coffe or root beer. ""When ready for desert, fill each glass with cold coffee or root beer and serve at once with straws. Pass the cookies as an accompaniment."" (which cookies I have been instructed to ""Arrange ..on a serving plate."")A gigantic ""duh!"" for this book and an insult to one's intelligence. Don't waste your money on this one."

3,Where is Collection Box #??,"This cartoon show is not bad, but they leave you hanging and even on the dvd last episode, it shows another episode after it advertised, but where do i get the next collection 2?"
1,Great...For a few months,"I purchased this tester for work, doing basic lube work for a dealership. I needed a quick tool to test the CCA of batteries, and this tool was perfect. That is until it stopped working. I started to notice about 4 months in that i was struggling to get a connection and constantly have to move the wires around. Now it does not work at all. The battery tester is not good for constant use, most other people in the shop have the MAC version of the tester and it obviously lasted a lot longer then this. Have been trying to find some sort of way to talk to the company, but cannot find an email or a place i can send it in to get checked on. Really disappointed, if it lasted it would of been a great tester. Try to find a better tester."
4,Battery Load Tester,"Since taking delivery of this tester, I have had only one opportunity to use it. But, the battery I was testing did not have the minimum 7-Volt charge requirement, in order to test it using this tester. This is the only reason I gave this tester 4 Stars instead of 5. This Kit includes a case, which hold the tester, leads and operation manual. The case includes a felcro strap to hold everything in place. I have a couple of old cars that are not driven much. Low Batteries are always a problem. This Tester is a handy way to determine if the battery is good or bad. Another plus is this tester can be used to perform basic starting and charging tests."
1,OTC battery tester,"I bought this for $100 and I should have returned it. It says to test with ignition off which is interesting because it means it doesn't test the whole system and get hot like the load testers for $30.Manual says wait 3 seconds. Mine displays result immediately so I am not sure what it is testing. Manual says it displays ""available CCAs."" But mine does not. Instead I think you enter your CCA. It says ""tt even compensates for cold temperatures,"" but instead you have to tell its cold temperature by pressing ""cold test"" button.The only useful information I got on my good 1 year old battery is voltage which you can getfrom a $10 voltmeter. The manual has clear english but information is very limited. It doesn't explain features and reasoning of why/how it works."
3,Easy to use but how reliable?,Bought this unit for work to test home standby generator batteries. It says it will test during cold temperatures by just using the cold test button when testing below 30 degrees F. I have had this tester say a battery has failed the cold test on a cold day but when I bring the same battery back to the shop let it warm up and test it on normal it passes. This makes me worry about how reliable this unit is as batteries usually always fail in the cold. If i test it when its warm and it passes?
4,Nice Firm Pillow,I got this for my wife and she likes how it feels on her lower back.She has lower back problems and this helps ease the pain.
2,Box Set,"Ok, these look like they might possibly be metal harmonicas. I wasn't expecting top of the line stuff, but when they arrove and they were plastic I was surprised. They don't play all that well, but you can at least not worry about losing or droping one, then you will have a decent little case to put a good one into. They aren't that bad really. Just didn't expect these little plastic deals. They are not what I would want to practice with, because it's tough getting clean sound out of them."
5,Fun and Easy first steps in Irish,"The Buntus Cainte books and tapes are an easy way to learn some basic Irish vocabulary and simple sentences. The series is designed to be ""first steps in spoken Irish,"" and the steps are easy to follow. The tapes and pictures are helpful and make the course fun, for adults as well as children."
4,A big hit for little ones with busy hands,"My two year old really enjoys the ""crank"" action of this Ferris Wheel. The associated ""carnival games"" are just so-so and a little difficult for her to detach and reattach to the unit, but the two little people that come with the set are cute. As others have noted, this is a little on the noisy side from a sound perspective. However, that's because we are boring adults, not two year olds; the little ones love the sounds. All in all this toy is reasonably priced and much enjoyed. The ""crank"" action is a huge plus and the people stay in their seats nicely due to the design."
2,This is the most annoying toy ever,I had to take the batteries out of this thing because it plays a little girl laughing and its the most annoying laugh I have ever heard. My kids never play with it so its going in the next garage sale.
2,"Nice idea, but kind of noisy","I loved this toy in the box, but it is kind of loud, also the crank shaft does not work very well, so the child does not get the sensation of turning the wheel, the wheel spins around loosely. This could be a great toy with some improvements."
2,It wasn't worth the money.,We have had it for a year and my son NEVER plays with it. It's a cute idea but not worth the money to actually buy.
2,Dry & Boring!,"I've heard so many good things about this book and was really excited to read it. The excitment quickly died when I started to read it. It reminds me of some of the worst text books I read in college. You know the type dry and packed with meaningless terms that you'd memorized for a test and quickly forget. This not a straight forward get down to business book. The author could of done a much better job in making this an enjoyable read, rather than a painful one. If you dig terms like crucible and disintermediation - go for it. I gave it 2 stars because it does have a message if you can ignore the over complicated way it's presented."
1,Abandon Hope All Ye Who Enter Here,"The author is no Dante, but reading this book should be a punishment reserved for one of the rings of hell.If you possess a modicum of common sense and sales acumen, this book is worthless. I ""hope"" you don't waste your money on this and I ""hope"" the author never publishes anything else. There are some wonderful books about selling available, this is not among them."
1,This book is a waste of money,It is fulll of insightful sounding phrases but has very little of substance to offer.
4,Good refresher book for professionals,"""A conditional recommendation-it is a wonderful refresher book for mid to senior BD's. A good starter book for BD's.The key to the refresher is that to be the best, one must provide the best service to the clients, earn and work hard to gain the trust of the client and know why ou are better than the competition. Rick page has examples of the old AMS and how the BD won the trust of the client by being more knoweldgeable of their organizationals needs than the client (HUD?). """
3,Very good,Great book if you are new to this type of sales cycle. If you have some experience than most of the material you probably already know.
5,great book!,"there r a lot of sales books. but this book deal with B2B and hi-tech sales. very clear, describe the situation well and improve the performance. it's a must to all sales, marketing and marcom managers of hi-tech companies."
4,Excellent Practical Examples,"This book is about sales strategy and techniques in complex sales situation. It contains many examples of author¡s real experience. These examples is the best element in the book. They illustrate the author¡s ideas/concepts perfectly. Practical, Concise, Easy to Understand. It is better to read than amateur work of consultants, professors.This book preaches on long-term, win-win relationship with customers. Not those type of ¡hit-and-run¡ sales.There isn¡t really breakthrough ideas/concepts. It is more a combination of conventional ideas/concepts, which are still relevant in today¡s complex sales situations. Having said that, there are charts and contents useful for personal reminders and internal training.Rick Page tried to create analogy between some sales concepts and warfare. But some of such analogies are not easy to understand."
2,A miss...unless you have no sales expereince,"For an experienced sales person of 20 years, this is not a good book. I have read many books on sales and done many courses such as IBM sales, Strategic Sales, Targeted Account Selling and SPIN. This book was just a rehash of those courses (They are excellent courses though) and presented their message very shallow. Because of information technology, today sales have morphed into something new. The value of the salesperson is changing and can be lost if not approached correctly. This book does not at all mentioned that. The examples are poor and everything is pretty shallow. I would have gone with a more modern approach.If you have no sales experience and you want something light to read, than you can browse this book. It is written like one big Power Point presentation."
3,budget dining,There are many other books about dining in Houston that are far more helpful and easier to reference. I would not rate this book as a winner.
4,"HOUSTON, WE HAVE A BARGAIN","It obvious the the author has done his research and is very familiar with Houston. This guide is easy to navigate and simple to follow. Houston, has so many restaurants and it's good to know where to get a bargain, even if ur a native. Might i say though if you are a first time houston visitor, splerge at least one night and go to Cafe Annie, or Marks, or Tony's, or America's, or Ruggles and live a little, I mean Houston has so many great restaurants that are well worth the steap price, just use the money u saved buying this guide used on amazon and with the knowledge u aquire there in and go treat yourself, Houston is blessed with some of the best restaurants in the country, you only live once, right?"
5,Mikey Does Houston,"Move over, Shakespeare. Stand aside, Tolstoy. Roll over, Porky Pig. A bright new literary and eating talent has emerged...and his name is Mike Ricetti. Who else but Houston-native Ricetti could have the literary chops and cast iron stomach necessary to write this ode to cholesterol, this towering magnum opus of grease? I found his book engaging, witty, and chocked full of useful information about eating and drinking in Houston. Too bad I live in San Francisco. Still, at 413 pages, the book will come in handy on my next trip to Texas, or as a door stop. From the most rustic taqueria to the glittering (and uncrowded) Enron employee cafeteria, it's all there. I highly recommend this book to any human being capable of ingesting solid food, and I can't wait for the indefagitable Ricetti's next project, which I understand involves eating his way to Tierra Del Fuego on $1 per day (including Pepto Bismol)."
5,Old Favorites and New Surprises,"Who knew that the Chinese food restaurant around the corner (which we had never bothered to try!) was a hidden gem? Mike Riccetti did! Besides some of the Houston standards, there are many pleasant surprise choices in this book. Reviews are accurate representations and include info on atmosphere, drinks, and ""what to order."" Riccetti advises on places with breakfast specials and lunch bargains as well. Some of Houston's best restaurants offer good deals at lunch - he'll tell you which ones. Restaurants reviewed heavily favor Vietnemese, Mexican, etc, but will give you the courage to try some of those strip-mall joints you've wondered about (you'll be pleased!). Most restaurants are inside the Beltway/near the Loop but there are a few on the outskirts as well. Indexed by cuisine type, meal, location, etc. Very easy to find what you want. Call ahead, however - some of the information is already outdated due to the rapidly changing nature of the restaurant industry."
3,You will never stop putting it together.,"My kids are having loads of fun with this, but ..... because of the ""spread out"" design of this playset, it would come apart every time they tried to move it. I finally ended up buying an extra large baseplate to put underneath it. That solved the problem nicely."
3,Ordered for grandson,"I ordered this for my grandson at his request for his 10th birthday. When I called and talked to him he said his parents were not able to let him set it up yet because it required too much room. He was going to have to take something down before they would let him put it up. Between train sets and engineering type toys his room is pretty full up.Before I ordered it, I spoke to him about the amount of room needed for it and he wanted it anyway."
1,Try Elmers,"Hands down the worst glue I've ever used. Couldn't glue felt to cardboard. Don't buy anything with the words ""gel"" in it. Doesn't work at all. Go for the liquid."
2,Very little glue in product,"I thought maybe it was fluke that the one unsatisfied customer didn't get much glue in their tube, but when I got it, I squeezed it and air came out...consisted of about half of the tubing. Was only enough to fix small part of a pair of shoes that were slightly falling apart. I'd recommend another product. When I figure out which product is better I'll be editing my post."
2,Not much glue in it,"I ordered this super glue so that I would meet the requirements for free shipping. So, it only cost a few bucks versus paying over $9 for shipping of the pan I wanted. When we went to use it, got only a little dab of glue and the tube was almost empty. At least I saved about $7 in shipping so it wasn't all bad....and the glue did work well, just wasn't a full tube."
2,Piedmont Blues Harmonica,This would be a wonderful product for a child's music class...like elementry school. The outer shell of the harmonical is PLASTIC. They make an ok sound but do not consider buying this for any serious music student.They look good in the pictures but I was not pleased with the quality of material.
1,Boring,"This is my second Bentley Little book, the first one was University which was a lot of fun. I am sorry to say that I found The Town incredibly boring, I had to struggle to finish the last pages."
2,Well.........,Somehow I ended up with 2 of these books on my order.I emailed the seller and told them I did not intend to order 2 of the same book.I even contacted amazon.I still got both books.
1,a lousy book,"This book was so bad that I was unable to finish it. The writer may have written many fine novels for all I know of him but, unfortunately, this was not one of them."
2,Weak horror novel,"This is the second novel I have read by Little. I read University first and thought it to be a good read, a little riduculous at times. But the horror was constant and good. The Town, however, was WEAK and boring. There were a few moments here and there of some good horror. Just when it got ""good"" it sank back down into a slump of boring reading. Waiting and waiting for another exciting moment. There was a very disturbing fantasy plot and ONE shocking moment, to me anyway, involving Sasha at the end. I just did not see it coming. The Town was just way too ridiculous, Jedushka Mevedushka? That was really the explanation for all of this??!! What a let down. Seemed a little too silly for me to buy, especially for an adult horror novel. There was also hardly any blood or gore. I am, however, not giving up on Little yet. I will give him another try with The Association."
1,"Mr. Little, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!","I am a very avid reader of Bentley Little's books, so naturally, i couldn't wait to pick this one up to start reading it. Boy do I wish I hadn't! Often times throughout the book, I found myself growing restless and forcing myself to turn the page. This book does have some of Mr. Little's trademark strangeness, but this is one of his books that should never have hit the shelves, much less the post office to be shipped to his publisher. All i can say is I hope nothing like this ever hits the shelves from him again!"
3,I just didn't like the characters,I read the Store and the Revelation by Mr. Little and was very impressed by both of these books. I just finished the Town and was not as impressed. I liked the story and the setting but I did not like any of the main characters with the exception of Adam. I think that both Gregory and Julia were pretentious snobs. I think that Sasha was a mad-at-the-world-for-no-reason brat and Gregory's mother was an overly superstitious(to the point of irritating) person. If the characters had been more likeable I think the Town is worth 5 stars.
3,"Not bad, but not great either.","I have to admit,I went into reading this book with the same enthusiasm as i had Bentley's other book 'The Store' which blew me away, but after reading ""The Town"", i felt a little let down. Don't get me wrong, Bentley has a way of making you feel like you're right there in the town and there were some choice moments like, a breif reference to The Store and a woman gives birth to a cactus (you have to read it to belive it!) But the ending felt a little rushed and silly, making the book feel like something out of a cheap b-movie one would see on HBO or Cinemax. Although this one was a it of a disappointment, I'm sure the next one will be better and I'll be taking the time until then to go back and read his earlier works."
2,Not the Ultimate in Horror,"As an horror fan, I always give a chance to new rising artist, and frankly after reading this book I got disappointed in his writing. The author jumps from scene to scene without any connecting points to follow. Perhaps his other books will be better. As a person who usually finishes a book in one day, my raiting has to be low for this little book."
3,Not as compelling as his other works....,Not a bad read but not a page turner as most of his other books are. The characters were not as interesting and the Russian connections did not connect.Still a must for any Bentley fan and the last 100 pages were very good.It just took a while to get there.
3,The Town has its Ups and Down..towns.,"The Town is basically entertaining and not hard to get through, (except perhaps for the beginning). The gore gets a little overdone where Little could have used more meaningful actions instead. I like the plot, a secluded mining town has to deal with a killer monster that was created a generation ago. The old townsfolk remember the secret of why this evil was created and therefore hold the key to its demise. Although I felt the book was slightly lacking in depth (especially the beginning), the ending did come through and for me it saved the book. I will try another of his books, perhaps he was just getting warmed up with The Town."
1,The Shining was better!,"The book was dry, and the ending was too quick. It was predictable, and too similar with The Shining. I'm a Bentley Little fan, but was rather let down with this book."
3,"Probably his WORST novel, but better than some writers","Little's worst novel, but still better than some published writers, who have no imagination, ie Ron Dee. Little offers his spin on The Shining, meaning possession of one's body by an evil spirit.The premise is a slightly original one. Greg Tomasov wins the California lottery and moves his family back home to a samll town in Arizona. Little describes southwestern life in great detail and adds a little russian history to the mix.The spirits in the bathhouse are somewhat underdone, but Greg's possession is entirely predictable; however you never can tell with Little. The tone of the novel between the russians and redneck ""townies"" is conceivable given Arizona is home to some true yokels.The ending is solid and the book is a decent read, but as already stated, not up to vintage Little-ites standards."
1,Scary? Not!,"Having read Bentley Little's previous works and having been chilled to the bone by ""The Store"", it was with great anticipation that I started ""The Town."" I kept reading and, having paid good money for the book, kept on reading. And I kept wondering, when is something interesting going to happen? To any reader looking for a spooky, fast-paced horror story that will make you keep the lights on at night, I recommend that you choose another book. This one was just flat, lackluster and, ultimately, boring."
3,The Town,"This is the first book I have read by Bentley Little. There are some similarities with other horror books I have read, such as ""The Shining"" by King. (I guess this is why King bestows flattery upon Little.) However, I did find a couple of the scences intersting: the growing navel and the lucid thoughts during the rampage of Gregory. There was some jumping between the characters through the novel, but I just took this as a way of adding to the reader's perception of the confusion the town was experiencing. After this book, I would probably read another book by Little. The story read fairly well (there were several small errors and then the last name of the main characters was spelled two different ways). However, these small things do add up, which can distract the reader the author's work. In the end, what I found most interesting in the book was the Molokan cultural information that was a major component. This was my first exposure to this culture and was intrigued by it."
4,A good read but...,"This was the first Little story I read, and was impressed by it. The characterizations were very good (a char. has to be well written to be snobbish or a brat...) but I agree with some of the other reviews that it had problems. As with most horror books, it had a rushed bad ending, and there were story threads that were not followed up on. Also, some of the ideas were forced, like the Russian man's shadow and the child's femur, and some were just strange like the spoon found on the hill (???). But if you ignore these small flaws (you usually have to for horror) it was a good book in general. A nice light read with some interesting ideas for killing people."
3,more cultural than horror,"I like to read anything remotely scary. I didn't get the shocker I expected, like Sasha not really being Julia's daughter or Babunya having an affair with Jim. I learned alot about Russian background and beliefs so it was informative there. The past being brought up 2/3rds through the book was a disappointment. I will read more of his books, even SK writes one every once in a while that leaves me hungry for more story. There were a few mistakes in spelling, but I was entertained for a few days."
5,You're going to love this!,"Thank you Ambrose! Finally ""easy listening"" jazz with passion! Heard ""Pleasure,Pain,Dezire"" at a friends house and loved it.I'm getting a copy for myself and my boyfriend. Very Sexy."
4,Rifftrax,I love this stuff but the crew seemed to struggle with this set and the humor was not quite up to par.
3,the product desciption,"i think the ""editorial review"" is wrong. it says ""galaxy invader"" and ""crater lake monster"" are included with ""artisnal shorts"". i'm pretty sure these are three separate DVDs. i've never seen it though, so i could be wrong."
4,Second helping of the Garrett series scores..,"""The February Trouble"" makes use of the great action of the previous book without feeling so flat. In this helping of the Dave Garrett series, our ex lawyer turned P.I is hired to help protect a restaurant francisee from an unknown saboteur. Soon, the francisee's wife has been kidnapped, and Garrett is suspictious about why he was hired, and if the woman was really kidnapped. He then unearths some deeply hidden secrets within the family of his employer, but not before a few people die because of the entanglements weaved. At points it channels the best of noir. Great mystery that keeps you guessing until the end, and makes great use of the Lancaster county scenery."
3,Mystery of the Month,"Neil Albert is back with Dave Garrett, the disbarred attorney now a private eye. Neil Albert paints a vivid picture of the Lancaster County, PA farm country and the nuances of the Amish in this interesting mystery. It will definitely leave you yearning for more Dave Garrett."
4,No wonder the Cylons won,"my dad doesn't even know what a colonial viper is much less who, where or what a battlestar is, but he could have done a better job assembling it since the photo shows it with backward wings and backwards front landing gear."
5,Your Fins are on Backwards!!!,"Guess what...whomever put the model together, never watched the series or read the directions!!!Your Fins are on Backwards!!! I guess they can shoot the Cylons from behind now...This would of saved Rick Springfield (Zac)"
3,Please change the picture,"Please, For God's sake, change this picture! The person (who has assembled this kit) has glued the wings backwards ... so it's a bad advertising to this kit showing this picture."
3,"Well, at least someone hires the mentally challenged","Well, I for one am happy to see that someone hires the mentally challenged for assembly work.Wings backwards, gear backwards, geez. If the manufacturer submitted this pic, they should be embarrassed."
4,Glad they made one,"Pros:- they finally made one that was close to being accurate after 2+ decades; and at a decent size.Cons:- quality seems to be a problem with this manufacturer. The wings look like they are supposed to swivel or detach but my guess is, if you tried they would just snap off and break. There are too many visible gaps in the model.- paint on hull looks like it was manually applied with a brush- i am assuming that is the look they wanted...In general they did a better job on the cylon raider."
5,Blast from the Past,"The Battlestar Galactica viper. Ahhh the memories! This is what I like. A model kit that comes already made up, AND painted too. No messing around with Airfix glue and sprues. The detail is excellent.Now all I need is for them to make the starfighter from Buck Rogers!"
1,Serious design flaws really limit usefulness...,"This bike is obviously for the very casual rider - not for any serious rider. Just the fact that it is a fixed gear ratio limits your top speed to somewhere around 3~4 mph. Even with that understanding, this bike is disappointing. With all the riders weight on the rear two wheels, there is virtually no weight on the traction wheel. The result is that the bike can't climb any sort of grade - especially if the roadway is at all damp or sandy. The steering mechanism also gives the bike an absurdly large turning radius. These two facts really render the bike useless even for casual riding."
4,Lunch time exercise,"I bought this bike because i need exercise and i have a bad knee. The bike is not fast but it didn't need to be. i just needed to get out of my chair at lunch, and ride. Walking put a lot of strain on my knee because of my weight, but riding seemed like the thing to do. Besides the exercise i'm getting, it's fun. The bike is a little small but it works for me. If i were to do it again, i would buy the 20 inch model."
4,great bike.,"This bike is so much fun. It has limits like flat road and weight, but easy to ride and very comfortable. It adjusts in two minutes for small children to very tall men.It might take some maintenance to keep the tires pumped and pedals tight. Really worth it."
4,I love mine,"I bought this so I could work out and not put much pressure on my spine. My kids kind of laughed when they saw it because of the flames on it. I took it for a spin out on our dirt road and I had no problems with handling once I got used to the steering. It won't turn on a dime and it isn't the fastest thing out there but it is very comfortable and easy to use. If you have arthritis in your knees, you find this easier to use. I found the pressure in my joints was not as hard as on a regular bike. I do wish it was faster and that it came in a more ""adult"" paint job but that would be my only complaint."
3,"works, but some drawbacks","The basic KVM functions fine for me at resolutions up to1280 x 1024 on windows and linux, and without a separatepower supply. However I have encountered two problems:1. Each time I switch from one computer to the other, I haveto readjust the position of the image on my monitor. Hawkinghas been unable to suggest any solution.2. Like most computers, mine puts the monitor in low power modeafter a period of inactivity. The KVM interferes with this."
2,Video problems galore - stay away,"I have a 19"" LCD Dell 1900FP monitor. I could not choose any better resolution level than 640x480! Beware, Xwindows crashed on the first load my Redhat 9 box. (despite editing the XF86Config file and choosing a generic monitor). It seems as that display output is not interpreted correctly by linux. I am assuming this unit works fine under Windows. I even tried my RH9 install CD's using the graphical installer and the text and images were off the screen. I eventually got the display, mouse and keyboard all working at 640x480. So unless you like HUGE images, stay away.Overalll, I am not very impressed."
4,Warning: Not Really a Greatest Hits but still worth every $,"OK, this is the oldest trick in the book, label it ""Greatest Hits"" and then in really tiny type on the back put ""live recordings."" People pick it up thinking they are getting what they heard on the radio in the mid 80s. If that is what you want, please move along.However this is a really interesting collection for fans. It does have two new ""remixes"" (really wholesale rerecordings) that are fine. But it is in the live tracks that Jones really shines. Instead of merely trying to reproduce his hits he offers extended versions, with plenty of riffs and wanderings, often even altogether different approaches. As a long time fan I found these new recordings refreshing and fun, and for very little money you can't go wrong!"
2,Where's Beyonce song?,"I wish I had read the other reviews before purchasing this CD. The main reason I purchased it was for Beyonce's ""A Woman Like Me"", and it's not on it! Can anyone tell me where I can find this song by her? I've checked her CD's and don't find it on any of them. This CD, without Beyonce, is okay, but I'm very disappointed."
1,Warning! Several Rape Scenes!,"In a nutshell, the hero, Tristan, invades the heroine's home, rapes her, and tells her she doesn't know the meaning of true rape? Okay so he didn't brutalize her but that's supposed to make it okay? And when she finds out she is pregnant and wants to rid herself of the baby, he slaps her. He forces her to marry him when the king threatens to take the home away that Tristan invaded. Later on in the story, he threatens to take away the child when he is mad at her. This guy is the hero? Fifty pages after meeting him, I wanted to jump into the story and kill him. This is not a contemporary novel, but that does not mean that all men in this time period were brutalizing rapists. This is the last time I ever buy anything by this author."
3,a mediocre read.,"Usually, I am such a big Shannon Drake's fan. However, I can't really enjoy this book. If you ask me what I think of Lord Tristan, I will say he is a biggest sadist. First, he attacked Lady Genevieve's home, Edenby Castle, and caused the death of her father & Fiancé. After he took the castle, he raped her and locked her up to prevent her from escaping. The couple of times, she managed to escape, he would capture her and drag her back to her imprisonment. When he found out she was pregnant, he slapped the hell out of her. After King demanded Lord Tristan to marry the girl, he bounded and gagged her to the altar. Don't mention the fact he loved to coerce her by pulling on her hair. The worst part is Lay Genevieve fell in love with this sadist, which I think is a beginning of an abusive relationship."
5,Fantastic insight into the life of Midge Ure,"If you are a fan of Midge Ure like I am, this book is a must. He tells great stories from the late 70's, early 80's London that makes me wish I could have been there to see this musical explosion of punk and New Wave. It was fascinating to read ""behind the scenes"" stories of the recording of ""Do They Know It's Christmas?"" and the organizing of the monumental concert that was ""Live Aid"". Midge truly is a fantastic musician and a pretty good wordsmith. This book is never boring and even if you are not a Midge Ure/Ultravox fan but an 80's music fan, you'll find yourself enjoying the stories of different musicians that enter and exit his life and their impact on his musical career."
5,Awesome,Not only is Midge Ure a good singer/songwriter but he also has a way with writing books. Here's hoping he considers writing more.
4,Great story,"I haven't read this book in about 10 years (since I was 10,) but I remember loving it... great story, you'll really wonder what happens, and what has happened in the past, and feel for Sylvie."
3,"harsh, gritty,real, heart wrenching","I read this, thinking that my 14 year old daughter might like it. I was wrong. Ellen Conford is a talented writer, but this book was heart wrenching. You ache for Sylvie, the main character.The things she goes through are too real and you want to see a happy ending, but there can't be because she's 15 and can't control her own destiny. Why would anyone want to read a book that makes you feel bad and has no happy ending ?"
1,Not Worth Your Time,"This book's poems aren't even that good.Some of the poems the company publishes are incredible, but none of them are even in there.Plus,most of the poets who are in there have only written one poem. And not all the poets who won prizes turn up in it. I myself won a prize with them, do you see me in there? No.What I'm trying to get at is, don't even bother buying this book. It isn't even worthy of being in a doctor's office waiting room."
2,Too small,"I know few people who have such a small phone anymore. I have what would be called a medium sized phone and it didn't fit. I can use it for money, credit card or keys while working out, I guess."
1,Don't Reccomend,"I bought this toy for my 2 year old for Christmas. I built it and put the bateries in the cash register no problem. The cash register said one word and never worked again. I tried everything to no avail. The next day I took it back because it was my daughters big present and wanted her to have it. When I took it back they were out of stock. So I got my money back read the reviews and decided not to go else where to buy another one. My daughter had the 3 other ROM packs which we opened and she plays with the food from those, but not worth [the money]. I was very disappointed in this product and Fisher Price."
1,What a disappointment!,I was always pleased with the Fisher Price quality for the toys I bought for my children so I expected it for the toys I buy for my grandchildren. My daughter put one together it worked for a couple trys then the scanner quit and the register quit alittle later. Returned it for a second one and same thing happened. My granddaughter loved it when it could do all that it was supposed to-what a disappointment!
2,A real disappointment!,"I read a review that gave this toy some negative feedback so I decided to test it out before my little girl's birthday. Just as another reviewer said, the drawer on the cash register doesn't stay closed because the spring is broken. In addition, the scanner feature doesn't work at all. It's such a cute toy, but it is VERY poorly made. I would not recommend it."
1,A Big Disappointment,"I recently purchased this toy for my 2 year old for his birthday. My husband did not have any problems putting the toy together, but within one day, it was completely useless. The scanner feature worked only a few times and then quit. We haven't been able to get it to work since. My son accidently knocked it over and the cash register electronics quit working after that. We've tried everything to make it work again, but to no avail. I was going to call Fisher-Price about the series of problems, but I am so disappointed and frustrated with the toy that I just didn't bother. Now it sits in the garage as nothing more than a colorful dust collector. I grew up with Fisher-Price toys and trust the brand name, so I am fairly upset that the toy quit working as quickly as it did.My advice to anyone who is thinking about buying this toy is not to bother. Obviously, Fisher-Price has a lot of problems to iron out before it becomes more reliable and durable possibly somewhere in the future."
3,Frustrating,"This toy has been a problem since day one. My 3 year old received this for Christmas and has only been able to play with it a handful of times. The first time(Christmas) we put it together it did not work. She was very upset that she could not play with her new Christmas toy. Since, Christmas we have had to replace it three times. The last time we had to call Fisher Price directly to get another one, secondary to no local stores had any in stock. The design of this toy is awful. The register has to go in just the right way for the system to work and once you get it in you are afraid that it will not work. The whole system is too delicate and cheaply designed for the price you pay. My daughter has given up on wanting to play with this toy. We will be returning it and buying her something else that WORKS!!!!!!!!!! Don't waste your money or time with this toy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Not all it should be,"This toy is a great concept, but it has too many problems, especially in light of the price. In addition to inconsisentcy with the scanner (and no mention of light issues in the instruction manual), the screeching of plastic rubbing against plastic on the drawer, both which have been mentioned, my unit says &quot;sheven&quot; instead of seven, and eggsh instead of eggs. My daughter is oblivious to these problems and loves it."
2,This would be a GREAT toy.... IF it would work!,"Our Smart Shopper cash register beeped once and that was the end of ours too! This was my 3 year old's Birthday present, so it's extremely disappointing. I've replaced batteries, and nothing. I will be calling Fisher-Price in the hopes of resolving EVERYTHING that is wrong with this ""toy"" (I am using that term loosly) It is not very sturdy and a little tough to get together. Everything about it is NOT GOOD! I say if you are interested in this product, RUN THE OTHER WAY, FAST! Find something else, something that will work! Very Unhappy in Michigan!"
1,WHAT A LET DOWN!!!,"WE BOUGHT THIS TOY FOR OUR 2 YEAR OLD BECAUSE IT LOOKED REALLY NEAT. I READ ALL THE REVIEWS AND KNEW ABOUT THE REGISTER AND I SHOULD HAVE LISTENED AND NOT BOUGHT IT! IT TOOK FOREVER TO PUT TOGETHER AND MANY CALLS TO FISHER PRICE. THEY SENT ME A TOUCH SENSATIVE SCANNER BECAUSE THE OTHER SCANNER WOULD NOT WORK EXCEPT UNDER HIGH LIGHT. THE CASH REGISTER WAS SO HARD TO PUT ON JUST RIGHT AND WHEN I DID GET IT ON, THE DRAWER KEPT OPENING ON ITS OWN. AS A MATTER OF FACT I JUST TOOK IT BACK TO THE STORE AND BOUGHT A KITCHEN FOR LESS MONEY AND IT MAKES LOTS AND LOTS OF REALISTIC SOUNDS! I REALLY WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS AT ALL."
1,Piece of CRAP,"My daughter received this item as a christmas gift. The first one we got was broken and the register would not work. My MIL returned it and got a new one. The new one worked for ONE week and then that register stopped working. The scanner worked only half the time. I didn't have the heart to tell my MIL that the toy wasn't working again. But BEWARE this toy is a piece of crap, big ole hunk of junk. Do not waste your money. Your child will learn NOTHING from this because it won't work long enough."
1,Not one of Fisher Price's finest!!,"We bought this for our daughter for Christmas. It has not been a good toy! First, it was difficult to get the yellow register part to line up correctly---if you don't do that, the drawer will never close! We finally got it right, thanks to previous reviewers on this website and their info. When I went to change the batteries on it today, we ran into the same problem.Another problem is that unless you are in a very bright light, the scanner in the middle will not work.The red bins to put the food in detach, which is a pain--I am constantly pushing them back on. There is not enough room for the play food to be stored on the shelves, either, though the food is well-made. With four children, we buy a LOT of Fisher Price toys. This is the first time I've been disappointed. Somebody needs to re-work this toy or take it off the market. DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!"
1,poorly made,"My 2 yearold daughter recently received this toy, she loves grocery stores. One of the yellow legs was cracked but not badit seems like it's getting worse. It is easily falls over the groceries don't stay on the shelves. when she opens or closesthe cash draw she fell with the whole toy and hit her chin.It doen't scann the groceries in less your in really bright light. Any 2 year old would get fustrated with the toy. we got it as gift and didn't have a receipt for it. So called Fisher Price they were no help. They don't have replacement parts for the legs. It's neat ideal but poorly made. Would not recommend this toy. It won't last and child could get hurt."
4,Does not tell all in instructions,We puchased this toy for our daughter.It is great for pretend shopping teaching about some grocerys and little bit about money even comes with a charge card.It was fairly easy to put together but we had a few problems with it the cash register would not stay closed so we had to adjust the spring and the big thing was we couldnot get the scanner to work no matter what we did so finally we had to call fisher price customer service and after going through numerous things the person helping us finally told us that it had to be in sunlight for it to work which it had nothing in our instructions about it this feature makes it a little disappointing on overcast days or anyplace not by sunlight the scanner does not work and therefore i am not real impressed with this product.It does have additional cards for the cash register you can buy.
2,IF ONY IT WORKED...,Really how bright a light do you need to make this scanner work. I can only make it work if I put a flash light on it while my 2 year old scans the items. Overall I think it would be a great toy and my son does play with it but unless I am there with my flash light he can not use the scanner and the register does not stay closed unless you slam it shut and then most of the time it pops open if you bump it. Fisher Price should really take this off the market and/or improve it. Had I not thrown out the box I would have taken it back to the store.
4,VERY CUTE,This is really cute and alot of fun. I almost didn't buy it because of all of the reviews. It took time putting it together but it's VERY sturdy.My 2 1/2yr. old son LOVES playing grocery store. I highly recommend this. Great alternative to a kitchen.
2,A disappointment,"Although the theme of the book sounds very interesting, the writing style and the extremely dense narrative made me stop reading after a few pages. There are a lot of details in the book but it just couldn't keep my interest for long. Better try other books on the U-Boat War."
5,Great CD,Patrick's CD is one of my favorites! Looking forward to hearing him on the radio and seeing his videos on CMT.If you like country music you have to add this CD to your collection!
3,good but should have been much better,"I absolutely echo what the other reviewer wrote about camera not on featured soloist. DP was all about musicianship; I assume most people buying this , like me, wanted to see RB and the others tearing it up. It is very frustrating to hear a guitar solo and be forced to watch other band members comping or standing around. I would rate the Danish performance as decent but not great. I WOULD recommend this for the DP fan just for the color Hofstra cuts, which are better both from a performance and editing standpoint. Overall I was very disappointed in the bw footage."
5,Neutrogena body lotion Seasame formula,"Like to get these as gifts for the ladies,no better way to score points with everyone from grandama to girlfriends. They like the lotion."
2,Nice moisturizer with a not so nice smell,"This is a nice moisturizer - it absorbs quickly, it's not greasy, and it makes my skin softer and smoother. But there is a huge BUT. The smell of this lotion is just too strong and is not pleasant at all (at least for me). It has not a light fresh scent, but rather a deep, stale smell that is very overpowering - I literally couldn't smell anything else but this product."
2,"Not ""Natural"" Enough","Should have read the ingredient label; loaded with parabens and too light for my dry skin. If you are not concerned with ingredients and have normal skin, you will like the silky feel."
2,Regretable Purchase,"I made the mistake of buying this product without knowing what it smelled like. I used it once, and it did leave my skin amazingly soft. The moisturized feeling lasted all day. However, it smells so bad to me that I can never use it again. It smells like the soap in a public restroom; that is the only way I can describe the scent. Waste of money for me, and it is a shame because it does work so very well."
5,Best Ever Lotion,"It is a great product: Non-greasy, not smelly, and moisturizes beautifully.What more can one say? It's great!. Love it"
2,smells like cheap motel lotion,For the size they give you the price is good.. the smell though its the soft pleasant smell everyone described. It smells cheap and almost like a granny scent. I only use it to lotion my feet after showering. Anywhere else and the scent lingers.
5,Feel and smell good all day long...,"This is absolutely the best body lotion especially when paired up with the Neutrogena Body Lotion, Light Sesame Formula. You certainly can't beat the deal on the 40 oz lotion that I found here on Amazon. After bathing I PAT dry and then use the oil, followed by the lotion. Yep, use both if you have really dry skin. There is no oily feeling whatsoever, as both soak right in and the smell is incredible - clean, fresh without being too girly, and a wonderful basis for any perfume I have. In fact, I have had people ask me what I have on with just the oil and lotion. I have been using this combo for years and years and my hubby now uses both products as well"
4,Very helpful resource!,"My acupuncture M.D. recommended this book to me. I first borrowed it from the library & it proved so good, I bought my own copy. We've used it as a household remedy for charley horse spasms, headaches, insomnia, allergic reactions & more. My husband gets charley horse spasms in his thigh & finds it difficult to get relief. The acupressure points recommended in the book for spasms cleared his pain within 60 seconds. For that alone, it's priceless in his eyes. I found that holding the recommended points when I am experiencing mild allergic reactions at least lessens the reaction if not clears it up entirely. Ditto for mild headaches. It's been extremely helpful & well worth the purchase price."
2,"Good enough, but falls flat on appendix sections","The main text part is simple and easy enough to follow, with illustrations and photographs. My 2 star rating, instead of 4 I would have given, is only due to the Appendix A and Appendix B. Appendix A shows nice diagrams of where the pressure points are, and those points are given by the codes (B2, CV6, etc.). Appendix B explains those points, and gives reference to the main text pages. Problem? Appendix B is sorted alphabetically by the exotic names of the points - Abdominal Sorrow, Above Tears - instead of Sp16 or GB41. So, if I want to know what LI14 does, I have to skim through Appendix B to find it. These enigmatic names are probably translations from Chinese, and frankly I don't care to know and I am not awed by exoticism. All they needed to do was to create Appendix B alphabetically using the codes, not the stupid names."
4,perfect introduction to acupressure,"Clearly I am not alone in finding this book excellent. In fairness, I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 because I have not utilized other acupressure books so have no comparison. It has proven to be very helpful and effective for me. I have averted many headaches and am making real progress with some long standing, chronic problems. It is so easy to implement that anyone could use these described techniques. ""Go for it""..you have nothing to lose and much to gain."
4,5 minutes to relief!,"I opened this book to the page on carpal tunnel syndrome and within 5 minutes of doing one simple exercise, my hand felt better than it had in 4 years! Easy to read format, great layout and very thorough!"
3,quite simple to follow treatment,"It would be helpful if can get information/ view the sample pages on the item description, such as the table of contents, etc. That way we will be able to see if the book has what we're looking for, sort of like in a virtual library; because sometimes you buy a book because it has something specific in the book that you've been looking for."
1,Difficult to understand,"Since I have no background in accupressure, I was unable to understand the book -- like, where is the Mound of the Golden Moon situated on my body? (I made that up, that was not an exact phrase, but there were a number of similar esoteric terms.) Within a week, I found another buyer and sold it."
1,Very Disappointed,"I have a history of foot problems, migraines and neck pain I received from military service. I have went to various military and civilian doctors over the years for all of these medical issues to seek relief. I saw this guide on Amazon and thought this would help give some relief for frequent pain. Also, and to my disappointment, this book has NO listing whatsoever in regards to problems with the foot below the ankle. The author seems to have neglected a very important part of the human body. The Podiatrist confirmed that anyone could have many problems, including arthritis, throughout the foot located below the ankle. I have applied the techniques listed in this book and have not received relief. I could only find relief from these migraines through medication and a masssage therapist for neck and foot pain. I waited many months to give feedback to ensure that I gave this purchase an appropriate amount of time to help others. Thank you."
5,A good buy,"This book is simple enough for the novice, yet detailed enough for the skilled practioner, Perfect!"
5,Very detailed,"This book has the pictures, many different procedures depending upon what ails you, lists the clinical terminology for the location of the pressure points, and more. NOT for the faint of heart - requires deep concentration if you're a novice - Might be perfect for someone that had any kind of medical experience."
3,"It's okay, but there are better books out there","I have mixed feelings about this book. It does cover a lot, but seems to go on about un-necessary or confusing things too. I got the The Acupressure Atlas at the same time, & I really prefer that one over this one. -May resell this book. If you're looking for a book for beginner's that gets to the point, I'd recommend the other one, although it is HUGE... ;-)"
3,Informative but difficult to understand for the newbie,"This book is very informative, but it is hard for the first-time ""acupuncturist"". :) Overall, I am learning more about the art from this book, but it could be a little more user friendly. :)"
4,Informative and Helpful,"I use it as a reference, in times of need; I find it very helpful, informative and easy to use."
5,It really works!,I borrowed this book from the library and now I'm buying two. The trigger points for insomnia really helped me. I've never slept so well. This is a great reference book for anyone's library.
5,potent points,"I love this book! I use it to help with relieving pain and tension in myself and otheres. I use it as a reference of what to do and where to do it when helping people. My massage therapist got me hooked on the book. She uses it herself in her practice and shows people the book so that they can help themselves as a preventitive measure. Some places you just have to have someone else do, but for the most part the points are easily reached. It has very good illistrations and directions on how to find the correct point. I know of three other people who have purchased this book since having work done on them and being shown the book. I think it is great."
4,Interesting and maybe helpful,This maybe helpful but I'm not sure how it can be used with the above product.The product is good for those interested in an alternative approch to issues
5,Potent Book!,"I offer this book to my patients so that they can continue to treat themselves between office visits. I've seen great results from it. This is another way for people to empower themselves and directly influence their health positively.Isa Holloway, Licensed Acupuncturist[...]"
5,Pain Relief,"This is an excellent book. The best and simplest pain relief - but you do have to do the exercises. He interjects some spiritual, metaphysical approaches that make it more personal for me. I have copied some pages of the book to give to people. Those who apply his pressure points are amazed that they work so well. I bought the book and gave it to my dauther because of her back pain. She applied his pressure points and exercises and was amazed to be relieved of her pain. It is illustrated, easy to read & highly effective. BUT YOU DO HAVE TO DO THE WORK YOURSELF."
4,Good for the right application,"As long as the surface is flat or nearly flat, works great - glass especially."
3,O.K. but unauthorized,"A bit misleading; Dave has very little interview time here, and of course no Foo music here since it is unauthorized. Quite a lot of history though and lots of credit to a deserving musician I must agree. I rate it about a 3, get it but don't pay a lot if you do."
3,Not user friendly,"the customer service number is not toll-free.the software is not user-friendly enough, I've had to call customer service on several occassions, but they are only available from 8-5pm pacific, which are usually the hours that I'm not around my printer.it's okay, but they can make this more user-friendly."
3,Lousy documentation,"This print server installs flawlessly in Windows 98, It installs with a bit of effort in Windows XP, but in Linux I gave up. Documentation stated the obvious and left everything else unanswered and I am still waiting for their tech support to return my e-mail. A [inexpensive] Print solution if you don't need ease of installation or any tech support."
4,A good little print server but...,"I had tough time understanding the manual provided. It says the PSAdminis for Netware environment but it is required for Windows users as well. If you don't install PSAdmin you can't do jack (like locating printerserver. configuring IP to prt server, etc). The manual's horrible and confusing at best. They didn't mention how to upgrade the firmware either. You just need to move the *.bin file to Printer Monitor or whatever directory where your PSAdmin is installed before doing upgrade. You just need to figure everything out yourself for this one...But I do agree that the printer server itself is solid and reliable if you know what you are doing."
5,Rock-solid print server - instruction manual hard to read,"At first, I must admit I was a little afraid from other reviews that the PN7127P's instruction manual was difficult to understand. It is difficult to understand (and I'm an experienced network engineer), but once you follow the tips from other reviewers on Amazon.com, it works great and is very easy to install. I would highly recommend the PN7127P. I can now print from any of my 4 computers on a peer-to-peer basis, regardless of operating system and regardless of what other systems are turned on. The print speed is very fast. A little refinement on the instruction manual will make this product perfect. I'm a happy PN7127P owner!"
2,Poor overall documentation and reliability.,"After a difficult initial setup caused by the lack of good product documentation the 7127P worked well for 6 months. The 7127P recently died in the middle of a print job and the printer starting endlessly printing mostly blank pages. Now the 7127P is useless. The unit gets a valid IP address but I can only sporadically access its configuration page. PSAdmin only shows the product at certain times and it's now impossible to configure the 7127P. When I restart the print server it works briefly, if at all, and then dies within a few minutes.I upgraded to a Netgear PS101 and it works without a hitch. I recommend you buy that product instead of this one."

5,SURPRISING,The book was exactly as described by the seller and was received in a timely fashion. This is a first person account from an astute individual who entered a government facility for the destitute. He serves as an ethnographer and an artist.
4,Smaller than I thought it would be,"It's a little smaller than I thought it would be, but that could be my fault for not reading the description more carefully. Otherwise, Marvin looks great. He was a gift for a friend and my friend loves it too. :)"
4,fun little gift,I got this as a fun little Christmas gift for my husband. He loves marvin. It was exactly what I thought it would be.
2,Bone pilow,The bone pillow was to thick to enjoy. Arrived on time everything was fine I just think it is to thick.
3,filling falls out from the seams,"I purchased 2 of these pillows and was slightly disappointed. Both pillows seem to have s crease threw the middle of the pillow and the filling was coming out of the outer seams when it arrived. We like them for laying on our backs or propped up in a seated position so they are not a total loss, just flimsy and not sown tightly."
5,Great pillow!,"This pillow works so well for watching TV, reading, travel. I have nerve compression in my neck and can't get comfortable when relaxing. I've tried several other types of neck pillows that always have to be rearranged. Not so with this one. The DogBone pillow is definitely the best that I have tried."
5,Fabulously comfortable!,"This pillow was recommended to me by my masseuse and it only took me about 2 years to buy it, but now that I have, I don't know why I waited so long! She takes it everywhere and I can see why, the only drawback is the cover isn't removable (unless you took all the stuffing out and then re-stuffed it, and I would anticipate it wouldn't have the same shape after that). Great for the neck and back for resting and sleeping and anytime!"
5,my neck and back do not hurt as long as I sleep on my neck bone. I love it.,my neck and back do not hurt as long as I sleep on my neck bone. I love it.
5,"DogBones NeckBones Chiropractic Neck Pillow, Green Floral","I love this dogbone pillow so much, I got 2 instead of one ^_^Its so cute plus it works excellent for the neck area.A must have Item ^_^"
4,Almost perfect,"I have a bad neck with a lot of pain. Neck pillows are great!This one is a little thick for my small neck. It just needs to be a tiny bit smaller around.Other than that, great product.I think everyone should sleep with one of these rather than the common pillow. It's much healthier for your spine."
5,I bought for the plane but even use at home,"This is a very nice travel pillow. It fits the neck nicely. I love the straps. They make it easy to carry, and easy to position. I liked this pillow so much I got my fiancee one too. (His is just blue) We both use them on the couch when we watch movies. Great pillow, very reasonable price."
4,pretty good,This neck pillow is very comfortable to sleep on when laying down but I found it not as comfortable in flight sitting up in a chair.
5,dog bone neck pillow,perfect I love them..I have been looking everywhere for these and finally found them here.
1,Fabric Hard-Not comfortable,The fabric actually hurt---it was very hard and felt uncomfortable when using it as a head rest support. The fabric feels like a canvas
5,A must for any cat lover!!!,"Judy Chicago explores feline charm and curiosity in this beautifully illustrated book. Every page takes you further into a day in the life of a cat, and both the words and images are lovely and captivating."
5,Three Generations of Women Think Kitty City is Terrific!,"My daughter, mother and I -- animal lovers all -- have spent many hours enjoying Judy Chicago's new book! We have learned from this smart and well written text, and grown very fond of each cat character. This renowned artist has given us an intimate glimpse and personal rendering of her life and loves. The extraordinarily fine book design allows the reader to fully appreciate the careful detail and remarkable color of the images, and this monumental project of twenty-four hours in the lives of some very special kitty's. We highly recommend this thought provoking and stellar book."
5,I've written 1400 fewer reviews than Grady Harp,"Art is a personal preference, as are 'cats vs. dogs!' I don't think we all will find the same art pleasing. But, I imagine any cat lover will be enchanted with this book. It is chock full of intriguing facts and lovely drawings. The price is truly modest for the beauty of the book itself (not only the art but the paper and color printing).Grady Harp, who has earned a badge for writing over 1400 book reviews for Amazon, was not pleased with the artist's depictions of people. I hope the people pictured in the book do not read Grady Harp's review. The people I know who are pictured are very nice looking, and the drawings of them are true to life.Maybe rewarding people for speed writing thousands of reviews is not a bright idea on the part of Amazon."
1,"Wow, Really?","I read this book at a shop, and that is all I needed. I just came on Amazon and saw the reviews. Holy crap! This is probably the creepiest book I've read. I honestly have no idea why it ever got published, but it does give me hope that I can one day get published too. It is not art, it is an unhealthy obsession with cats. This book was actually used as a joke in the shop it was at, but find out for yourself, just never pay 26 dollars for it."
3,Fun 'til it falls over!,"Both my one year old and my three year old love this toy! However, whenever the one year old tries to push the top buttons, the whole station falls over. I think they could have made a whole station that opens by splitting in half. My brothers had an FP one in the eighties with a hinge in the middle, so that kids can use both sides and it doesn't fall over. The best feature of the current one is that the fireman can come down a chute straight into the truck. My oldest was especially thrilled by that feature since he really wants a firepole in his own room."
5,My 2.5 year old still LOVES this toy.....,"We purchased this last Christmas for our then 1.5 year old daughter.She loved it from day one, and it's still among her favorites.She has lots of other Little People sets and LOVES joining them together.She doesn't find joining the fences difficult at all.This Christmas we've purchased the Little People doll house and can't wait to see her face when she opens it."
2,Disfuntional Swing!!!,"My daughter received the deluxe version of this toy - which comes with a bicycle a wagon and a car. I was so excited to get it because she loves swings. Well, you can put the little people in the swing but you can't push it because they come flying off. It's very frustrating for her - anyway I wound up getting her the little people playground, which has a great swing. Another negative is the house is waaaaay to small - nothing fits in it - not even the table and chairs it comes with. You have to have tea outside on your lawn!!!"
3,My daughter will not play with the little people :(,"This is my second little people playset. I read all the reviews and everyone in her age group loved these toys. So I went and bought her the Farm and this playset. These toys have quickly become a dust collector. She hasnt touched either one of them for at least a week I think the last time she touched this one was to move it out of the way. I'm glad others have had luck with their kids, I really think they are cute toys but no luck with my little girl :("
1,where's a vintage toy when ya need one?,"As a vintage toy lover,I hate it when some stupid toy company makes a new version of a vintage toy.If the toy isn't broke don't try to ""fix"" it!"
3,ok if you are slow,This saw would be acceptable for the DYIer who is not in a hurry. The pore little motor just cant be pushed to hard.
1,Caveat!,"I recently read this book with my son and was utterly appalled, both as a parent and as an educator in the public school system. This is surprising because we own numerous other DK books and I am a huge fan of the series. In addition to the fact that almost every story involves some sort of violence (hardly age-appropriate), a tiger is actually refered to as having been ""murdered"" (p. 35). Not only is the use of the word ""murder"" for an animal incorrect usage, it also sets an inappropriate tone in a book where humans are merely ""killed"" (p. 30; a much weaker word for an actual murder). If this book were not intended for reading alone by young children and if it were not part of a series used by schools, I would be considerably less concerned. Nevertheless, parents considering purchasing this book for their children should be aware that factual information is largely overshadowed by an overwhelmingly heavy-handed political message."
1,Appalling and inappropriate for kids,"My first grade son brought this home from the library this week and was so excited to read it before bed. We didn't get more than a couple pages in before a tiger is hit by a bus. I started flipping through the other stories to see if this was just a cautionary tale meant to set the backdrop for an informative book about tiger's habitats being encroached. Nope. Instead, I found that every story involved some sort of violence or killing.. I can't imagine how anyone could find this book appropriate for elementary school aged children."
5,Informative and entertaining,"My 8-year-old son and I both enjoyed this book. ""Tiger Tales"" presents a lot of information in text, drawings, photographs, and a map. And I learned something new, too. Do you and your children know why tigers, cheetahs, jaguars, and leopards have stripes or spots but lions and pumas do not? Well, if you don't know, this book is a good source for the answer!"
4,"Really nice toy, but not for the avid fan","Purchased this table after the holidays. Purchased from Amazon on sale for $580 + $1 shipping charge). Looks like the price is back up over $700 with shipping. Table is much better looking than any other pockey table I saw when I was shopping in stores. I was very plesantly surprised when I opened it up. Fairly easy to install. Did it myself in about an hour. Wood finish is very nice and two tone color works well. Only downside is that it is ""not the real thing"". I've had a real slate pool table before and this doesn't roll like a real table. Air hockey works fine, however the pucks and knockers are small. A nice table is you are looking for a toy for the rec room, but if you're an avid fan of pool or hockey, then this probably won't fit the bill."
2,Disappointing quality,"This was a very cheap (in price and quality) switch. I also found that this switch got hot. In fact, it would sometimes give off a burning plastic smell. The ports would work intermitently, and my computers would not be able to see the network. It finally just went dead after about a year and a half."
4,A Writer's Do-It-Yourself,"A companion to Lawrence Block's ""Liar's Bible,"" this guide for wannabe writers and old pros alike is a compilation of his learnings from having done it himself. A popular mystery writer, he shares his mistakes, his hard-learned lessons, and success tips. A practical how-to that's an enjoyable read in itself."
2,Really not worth the paper and ink,"If you're a very new writer and need some motivation then this cotton candy fluff might be of some use to you. I'm not understanding the rave reviews for this snoozer. It does have a very laid back and easy-to-read style, which is nice, but it doesn't contain enough meat to help you write a good novel. You could save yourself money and glean this same info but better on the website, Fiction Factor. Or check out the Elements of Writing Series or How to Write a Damn Good Novel."
1,dont buy,"old land sharks of the early and mid 90s were great shoes. these are really cheaply constructed and of poor quality. bought a pair not knowing nike had so botched the quality. wore them anyway. on the fourth use in wet conditions, the sole on one shoe came half off...taking me out of the game completely. when i got to the sideline i noticed the second sole was coming off as well. cant play when youre soles are flapping in the breeze. eastbay would not stand behind the product, since i had no box and no receipt (threw both away)no more nike, rightee"
2,Annoying and not very educational,"Our daughter received this as a gift, and we are so disappointed in it. The voice used to speak the letters/words is extremely high-pitched and barely understandable - plus it just grates on our nerves!The words used to illustrate the letters aren't common ones that a young child would know. ""L is for Lumier,"" ""F is for Flounder,"" ""T is for Tiara."" Add this to the fact that one can barely understand the voice, and we just don't see much educational value to the book.I suppose it might be fun for a child who was very familiar with the Disney princess movies, but we were unimpressed."
1,Pinches your skin when opening the book!,"I purchased this princess storybook for my 15 month old daughter. She loves pushing the buttons and turning the pages. But, she was wearing shorts while holding the book in her lap and when she opened the book she recieved a nasty pinch that resulted in a terrible yellow and purple bruise.Be careful when your child is playing with this item!!Amanda in MI"
5,"Blum 1/4"" Overlay Compact 33 Edge Mount Mounting Plate",Works well with the Blum self closing hinges. You have to Drill a 1.125 diameter hole for the hing. Cabinets look great with these new hinges.
4,"Good Condition, great ""starter"" comic","I love spiderman and I was trying to get my little siblings into comic books, so I bought this for them. Its a great starter comic book in the sense that it is cheap, not a ""real comic"" and it has the ability to bring people into the dark and drab concave of sorrow that we comic book lovers must live in every day.My only real problem is that it looks like it was stolen from a library."
1,A Real Disappointment!,"I highly doubt this is the best sportswriting of 1998! Littlefield picks two mediocre efforts by Charlie Pierce, and neglects the superb '98 writings of S.I.'s Steve Rushin and Franz Lidz. One has to wonder if a sort of reverse ""race card"" has been played here. This series grows increasingly mediocre. You'd be better off reading Rushin's great ""Road Swing"" and Lidz's astonishing ""Unstrung Heroes."""
1,Doesn't work,"Hardly worked when we got it. We had to hold it down forever. Now, a few months later, it doesn't work at all."
3,Stanley Mini Keychain,"Great size. However, from outside of the garage, while to door is down, you need to be very close to the garage door to get the mini remote to activate the opener. My full size remote had better range."
2,Flimsy case...,"This remote works fine but with two comments: First, the plastic case seems pretty thin, weak, flimsy, etc. Second, pushing the button doesn't stop the current door movement and allow you to reverse the action. The stanley remotes that came with the door will allow you to interrupt the cycle and change directions if you want.Programming was easy."
5,Timba at its best,All the music is fast and great to dance along with or do a fast-pace workout.I love this album. It is the best.
2,Does Not Work with Flash Drive,"Take this note of caution: This works fine for items that have to ""Power up"" for instance an external DVD drive or the connection to my PSP. But it doesn't work when I plug in my flash drive. (The Flash drive works fine when I plug it in directly to the USB port on the computer, BTW.) Unfortunately using this device, I have to reboot my computer each time when I plug it in so it can ""see"" the drive. Once it's unplugged, the drive goes away and when you plug the drive back in, it won't come back up until the computer is rebooted again.Yes, I can move other items around to free up a spare USB plug in the back. The problem is this is just the sort of item I bought the hub for--so I wouldn't have to wrestle the computer everytime I wanted to plug it in! I'm not sure if getting a ""powered"" hub would work better or not."
1,Bad singing,"I am a music teacher and I just bought this CD for my students to sing along with in class. I can't even bear to listen to the vocals and will not be sharing this one with my classes. I have many other CDs where the chidren singing are in tune, which I cannot say about this one."
1,Buyer Beware!,"This CD is one of the worst I've heard. It sounds like a bad Al Albert's Showcase. A few of the songs are ok, but overall it was not money well-spent. ""Winter Wonderland"" is by far the worst. The male singer (who sounds more manly than boyish) talks his way through it. My 2 year old daughter and I can't even get through the song. My advice would be to look elsewhere for Christmas music.!"
1,Junk.,"I was hoping this chalk would be more dense, less dusty, and less prone to breakage than the Crayola stuff that's out there now. Sadly, this is the same stuff you get everywhere else. What's worse, every single piece of chalk was pulverized; there wasn't a piece longer than one inch in the box. Finally, it's extremely overpriced; seven dollars for a single box of 12 chalks? Since it was all broken, I returned it."
2,Broken,"The chalk is adequate, but the shipping failed. 144 pieces of chalk; every single one broken."
4,"Works, with a warning...","This stuff does dry up poison ivy, but it will dry your skin up some too! Be sure to follow the instructions, know that it's going to sting when you first put it on (and for a few minutes afterwards), and just hold out. It's no instant fix, but it seems to numb the area some and that is worth waiting for! Just don't put it on a lot more than they recommend, it will dry out your skin as well, and that almost itches as bad!"
2,Ivy Dry with zytrel-Disappointing,"A friend of mine recommended this product to ""cure"" poison ivy, it did not work for that. It also has a very strange smell. I do not recommend this product."
5,An intimate personal search for Jewish meaning,"This book is an intriguing glimpse into the exhilirating, yet difficult journey of the author to lead a more Jewishly-informed life. Ms. Hendler describes her journey in a beautifully written style, with a no-holds-barred view of both the joy and difficulties in such a journey. The joy and meaning derived from her newfound literacy are beautiful to read. The personal difficulties faced in her newfound commitment to following more Jewish halakah are often disturbing. An example is her description of the time her family takes her to a crab house for Mother's Day, shortly after she has announced that she will keep kosher from now on. I highly recommend this well-told personal account and look foward to where Ms. Hendler next directs her literary talents."
3,Nice to see,"A nice video if you wish to know what Dim Sum is and never been to a Dim Sum restaurant. Not the best place to learn how to make them, though."
5,Some great shoes,"I've been looking everywhere for a flat that isn't so structured and fits more like a slipper. These are it! The only draw back is that they are glittery, more than in the photos which I think makes them look a little juvenile. My favorite color is pink, but I also have them in black. They also wear out pretty quick (or it could be that I just wear them too much!) but since they are cheap I just keep ordering new ones when they wear out. I get so many compliments from people who love them and tell me how comfy they look!"
5,comfortable and cute,I'm wearing these right now. They are great around the house and indoor shoes. I wear 7.5 and the size 8 fits perfectly. I like the elastic around the heel.
3,Average,"A well written book, but all the people are financially well off and do good things. How about the average joe-blow guy and what he does with the ""satisfactory"" part of his life."
3,Good - but not what I expected,"Finishing well is a collection of testimonials by people who put ""Half Time"" into action. I think the book I was looking for would be called ""Fourth Quarter"" as I'm looking for something that talks about new beginnings for folks later in life."
4,What's your definition of Retirement?,"This is really reading about 61 financially successful ""first half"" people describing their definition of Finishing Well. I think Buford lets the 61 people reiterate his philosphy that ""Retirement"" does not exist.""We can retire from our jobs, but we can never retire from our calling""The book is filled with jewels of wisdom and quotes from these 61 people across various professions and occupations.Buford gives the reader plenty of resources (books, movies, plays) to encourage them to explore their own journey of discovery and/or definition of how they vision they will ""Finish Well"".If you are in a transition stage of life - this is a worthy starting point in your personal discovery and spiritual journey - and how you define retirement."
2,"Inspirational for white, successful, religious males","As an agnostic female who has achieved success at high tech companies in various positions and who has a well rounded life including volunteerism, I thought this book might help me define what I want to do for the second half of my life.Instead I found it filled with example of example of people whose lives turned to serving God/faith based causes (granted I skimmed after a while but didn't see any examples of Indians or successful people of other relgions, only Christians).There were about 5 women out of 61 people total profiled.On the contrary Po Bronson's book focused on people from all walks of life, not those who have been VP or higher or had ""interesting"" lives.I found this book completely useless in that it seemed to have sneakily omitted it's true agenda of pushing faith by having NO MENTION ANYWHERE ON THE BOOK JACKET OF RELIGION."
5,These bags are wonderful,We walk our two dogs every day and always carry these Dispoz-A-Scoop bags. There is a pice of the cardboard handel that comes off and makes it easy to pick up the dogs bussiness. When the bag is full the wire frame slides up into the cardbord and makes a very sanitary package!
3,Sort of works,"I used these Dispoz-A-Scoop bags in an apartment complex where I use to live and loved them. Presently, I ordered because I had back surgery and can use them with a reacher so that I don't have to bend to pick up dog poop. They work fine to pick up but the wire does not go up in the card board to seal the bag even using it against a sturdy wood surface, the wire will bend before it slides up in the cardboard. I have tried numerous times and it just doesn't work. I was disappointed because these use to work great."
4,A Pickmeup,"Having raised dogs for many years, we know that others appreciate our picking up behind our dogs. We continue to use the Dispos-A-Scoop because it's just a little more pleasant using these scoops than using regular plastic bags. We highly recommend them! We do push the wires a little way in before using them to insure the wires work correctly."
3,Slightly disappointed,"I love the bright colors. However, these tend to be very slippery when using on cement or blacktop. I would look for ones that aren't as slippery."
5,Lots of Uses!,"These are great for lots of things - indoor ""seats"" for toddler reading or singing time and great for outdoor play - they can be used as bases, hopscotch - lots of things that kids can imagine."
4,Not to be missed,I loved this book! It is written by many well known authors about their relationships wth their father. Some true some not. All the stories were touching and some made me cry. I have read this book twice and had my father read it also. Father / Daughter relationships are among the strongest bonds in the world and this book proves it. I think everyone should read this book. It not only reconfirms your love of your father but makes you think twice about those times when you thought you didn't love him at all. I will definetly pass this book on to my daughter when she is old enogh to appreciate the love of her father.
1,Wha' ?,"""The Snapper"" is the first Roddy Doyle book I have read and it will definitely be my last. Captured almost exclusively in dialogue, the celebrated Doyle may be giving us a real slice of Irish working class life, but I didn't enjoy one moment of it. Perhaps the setting is too alien to me. The profanities that litter the lines and the heavy of vernacular may be authentic and true to the milieu, but I found it all too much. Sorry, I know this is a minority opinion but Doyle's exalted literary status escapes me."
5,Smart,"This guide is beautiful and very thorough, including information on even small towns and good subway maps for Barcelona and Madrid. It is also thorough in noting all the attractions each place has to offer, providing historical information as well as contact information, subway stop, operation hours, and free days! Most museums in Spain are closed at least one day a week, and we used this everywhere we went. It discusses major museums, churches, and mosques and points out important artists, carvings, or architechtural peculiarities in each. Another great feature is suggested walking routes in interesting neighborhoods in major cities - Spain has plenty of small streets, and we would've definitely missed some amazing places if not for this guide.This isn't going to give you a lot of hotels or restaurants, but it does a sufficient job in translating and explaining some peculiar foods and merchandise."
1,useless item,"- When the screen protectors are applied, there is a slight grainy rainbow effect distortion over the image quality of the screen.- one of the styli fell apart right out of the packageThe screen protectors and the styli went straight for the trashcan about 10 minutes after opening the package. The only thing I'll probably still use is the little piece of cloth that I can use to wipe the screen with, even that is low quality polyester."
3,Stylus Aid,"There are so many times a accessory kit for a video game system does not definitely have what it should have. For Pelican, they've made some mixed products that really haven't delivered all that well with products at a cheaper price. That is also with the results of the Pelican Starter Kit for the Nintendo DS system. This kit consists of stylus pens, and a screen protector. The stylus pens don't seem to really work very well, compared to the ones Nintendo has developed well. Although the screen protector gives a non-glaring gaze which works very well, it just isn't worth the money if all the working tools are 100% accurate. I honestly suggest you get the original backup stylus pens Nintendo developed for the DS instead.Price: CConvience: C 1/2+Overall: C"
5,curt bumper hitch,"very happy with the bumper hitch, it was hard to tell that this was a used item. the install went very well and was easy."
1,One star and should be 0 for alternate recordings,"Sighhhhh, someone gave this 5 stars? These songs are not the originals. The search continues.Anyone know if the WEA label CD is made using the original tapes? WEA stands for Warner,Elektra & Atlantic which is a MAJOR label so I'm hopeful.Aloha"
4,Great Product!,"My son loved to be swaddled, but at around 10 weeks he started getting out of it. We worried that the transition would be hard, but to our surprise, he adjusted right away! Its great knowing that he can't kick it off. My only issue is that I have to make sure he has on long sleeves or he wakes up and his arms are cold. Other than that, this product is great!"
5,Bought it immediately after a scare,"My husband found our newborn's face covered in his blanket one morning and gave us quite a scare. I purchased two Halo sleepsacks, one in cotton and one in fleece after that incident. I bought it a size bigger so that my baby can have extra leg room. It is one of the best purchases I have ever made for my baby. Highly recommended!"
2,Not a durable one,"I bought a X-large one and it's 100% cotton... but after one single wash, it became a medium size... Do they have XXXL size? probably not.."
4,Great but size should also include length,We love this sleepsack for our daughter! She wears it every night to bed. We feel comfortable that she has something on that is like a blanket but safe. The only problem I have with it is that she grew to long for it. The only size recommendation is by weight only. According to the tag she should still fit because of her weight but she is actually too long for it now. Maybe they should switch their sizing to the same weight and length recommendations as many clothing items have.
4,good lightweight sleepsack- maybe a little small,"This is a good choice for a lightweight sleepsack. I love the turquoise animal print and the zipper is good. I have two comments:I think it is on the small side. She seems to have grown out of it (in length) a little faster than she should have. Had I realized this, I would have bought a bigger size.When I washed it, it did that thing where the fabric shrinks a little and the zipper doesn't so the zipper looks all bubbly and puckers up.That being said, we've used it a lot and it's been fine. I'm not sure when I have to buy again what I will do."
5,Love all Halos!,"Halo sleepsacks are a great invention, my son cannot sleep well without one and I love being able to keep in in all cotton without the worry of him getting cold."
5,Worth every penny.,"Halo Sleepsacks are genius. I love that I never have to worry about my 8 month old daughter getting too cold when she sleeps. She has two of these sleep sacks in the medium size and she'll probably be able to wear them for at least a couple more months. They're roomy and allow her to move around as much as she likes. They zip up from the bottom, so nighttime changes are as easy, and they're actually made really well. I've washed these things so many times and they still look brand new. I'm more of a fan of the cotton knit sleepsacks than the fleece ones. They seem to be more durable and breathable."
4,"Nice, soft durable- just be prepared for shrinkage.","We have liked Halo's fleece style sleepsacks for fall & winter. They hold up well with daily use and frequent washing... For warmer weather we bought this 100% cotton blanket version....It is well-made, soft, and breathable. Just be aware that it may shrink. In our case, after the first washing, the X-Large size shrunk to the equivalent of a Large in the Halo fleece style."
1,Like a Potato Sack!,"This Halo Sleep Sack is rough, thin and not what I would expect a baby to wear. The pattern is awesome but the fabric is just awful!!!! I'm sending it back TODAY"
3,Great for younger babies,"I gave this sleep sack 3 starts for two reasons, 1.) HALO totally takes advantage of parents by pricing their sleep sacks waaay too high! and 2.) While very nice to have for Newborns and young Infants, 90% of SIDS cases are under 6 months old. The advice from my pediatrician and father of 8 was ""once your baby learns to roll from front to back and back to front, the risk for SIDS drops dramatically. In fact more Babies and Toddlers die from being forward faced in thier car seats too early yet the emphasis on SIDS is astounding!"" With that advice I personally don't feel the need to use these over priced sleep sacks past 6 months of age."
5,Awesome!,"Love it! When my son was a baby, we used this all the time! It's much better than others I've used. It's nice to know your baby is snug and safe."
5,Great product,"This sleep sack is a must-have. My baby has been wearing the medium size since 5.5 months. It's roomy but seems very comfortable. It's great having the security that she won't suffocate or get tangled in her blanket. I tried the microfleece sleep sack, but she woke up drenched in sweat. The cotton one is perfect. Keeps her nice and cozy without overheating. I highly recommend!"
4,Good Value,"This item is light-weight but still washes well. I can't imagine using it outside of the summer months, because it is really just T shirt material but it is perfect for a little extra warmth in the middle of the night."
2,Great product but damaged by washing machine,"I was very happy with the use of this sleep sack. But then the time came to wash it. I threw it in the washing machine like everything else... and it came out ruined. The zipper completely fell off and the rest of the zipper on the actual sleep sack had been damaged as well. I suppose this needs to be washed and dried with the zipper closed but I could not find any of those warnings or instructions on the product or packaging anywhere. And with my baby being my first, I always check washing instructions beforehand. So unfortunately for me I will be replacing a sack that was only a week or two old."
4,Great!,I used this on both my sons. Jordan loved being wrapped up in . Gabon didn't like being so confined. I liked it and it made them so much fun to cuddle with!
2,Wish there was an alternative,"The Halo sleepsack is the only brand I have found that makes a sleepsack in cotton. If I knew of another, I would buy that instead. In general, it's a great idea versus using a baby blanket as the baby can't kick it off or get it caught up in her face. But the Halo sleepsack has a zipper that you have to attach at the top and zip down. This makes it seriously difficult to put it on her when she's already sleeping. I've twice knocked her in the face trying to either attach the zipper or unzipping and detaching it. It would make more sense to have the zipper already attached at the bottom and zip it up. I have another one in fleece by a different maker that does this and I can easily get it on her even if she's sleeping and in the dark. But I wanted one in cotton for summer. I'm going to take the Halo's I have to a seamstress to change the zipper."
5,DONT USE BLANKETS WHEN PUTTING YOUR BABY TO SLEEP!!!,"I went to a class where they taught you about how to lay your baby when they go to sleep and what they should be wearing. I learned that you should NEVER use blankets or sleep positioners because the baby can scoot around and pull the blanket over their head and suffocate even on the positioners. I had a positioner on my registry and took it off. They are very unsafe. Babies should always be sleeping in a sleeper or a sleep sack. They should have started making these years ago. People think that swaddling babies in blankets when they sleep is safe, but it's not! They should only be in blankets when they are supervised. Take advise and get some of these!! It could save your baby's life."
3,DON'T BUY THIS FOR $20!!,"I bought a whole bunch of CP Puffles for my son at the Club Penguin shop at clubpenguin.com. I got lucky and found them for $2 each on Black Friday; $20 for ONE is ridiculously inflated. Don't encourage these price gouging sellers, do yourself a favor, and shop around. I believe the puffles are now going for $4 on clubpenguin.com."
2,Cotton Sleep Sack only OK - go with the fleece ones,"I have both the Halo fleece sleep sack and this cotton one. The cotton one is very flimsy and doesn't compare in quality to the fleece one - if you want a cotton sleep sack - why not just put the baby in a nightgown? The fleece one, however, is aweseom (even though I like the LullaBag slightly better than the Halo fleece sleep sack)"
5,Great product to keep baby/toddler warm!,"Has helped our little one sleep better through the night as she kicks off blankets. Great fit, keeps her warm and works great! No complaints. Good price too."
3,TOO BIG,"The quality of this sleeper is good. It's soft and has a cute design. The only problem is that it is HUGE. I ordered a Large based on the description (my baby girl is 11 months old). I think I could have fit 3 of her length-wise into the sleeper. I returned it for a medium and the medium is still HUGE. I also would prefer it to have sleeves. I am a huge fan of the Carter's sleepers. They are PERFECT and have sleeves. BUT, they come in ONE size: 0-9 months. My 11 month old is just about to grow out of it length-wise which is why I've been looking for something bigger."
5,love the sleep sack,"This is the perfect concept for a nursery with the optimal temperature in the 60's. With feetie pajamas underneath, I never worry that the kids are too cold. The sleep sack replaces blankets that will ultimately be kicked off; it also doesn't bundle up and poses no risk of suffocation. Rest easy indeed!"
5,A necessity!,Our son has had a sleep sack since he was born and he loves it! When we zip him up he knows it's time for sleep. I worry less knowing that he won't suffocate under a blanket when he rolls around at night.
3,Just ok,I tried this out for my 4 month old and it's just ok I found the baby dee sack to be alot better.
3,Not exactly what I expected,"I bought this sleep sack for my 6 mos old baby. It is a good weight for the cooler spring evenings, but is too heavy for daytime napping. I am a little disappointed with the size. The medium says up to 12 months, but my baby (who is 27.25in) does not have much room to grow into it. I also find the armholes to be a little snug (my baby is in the 50th percentile on weight for her age). All in all I thought I would love this since I really like the fleece version, but the cotton version is not what I expected."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE This Sleep Sack!,"Love this sleep sack! I am able to ensure my 6 month old will be nice and warm all night because he hasn't wiggled his way out of his blanket. This sleep sack is nice and roomy at the bottom allowing for leg room, wiggling, and stretching. The zipper zips up from the bottom which is great for middle of the night diaper changes."
5,very good,"it's nice and warm. because of the location of the zipper, you don't need to take off the blanket when changing diapers."
5,Love Love Love,I have used the sleepsack's on my daughter since she was 6 months old and got to big to be swaddled. I have love these. I keep 2 Cotton ones and 2 Fleece ones in her drawers. I love the cotton ones for summer and the Fleece ones are perfect for winter. I always worry about my baby girl getting cold and these are perfect. It will be a sad day when she grows out of them (she wears the xl now)
2,Runs very large,"I ordered the x large as it was for 18-24 months. It looked like it was for a 5 year old. Way, way too big for a little 31 inch tall baby to wear."
4,better than a blanket,"As a father of triplets I feel uniquely qualified to give the sleep sack an accurate review. I'm not sure if we would have survived without it and we used small, medium, and large versions as they grew from a few weeks to a year old.Blankets aren't safe to use with young babies, but it is still important to keep the little ones warm and comfortable. These do the trick and are easier to manage than constantly wrapping them.I'd recommend to Halo that they upgrade their zippers. After significant use one in three malfunction making it difficult to suit up a wiggling infant."
3,Very cute but shrinks!,"My son recently outgrew his medium sleep sacks. We had one cotton, one fleece, so I purchased two more in Size Large. While the fleece one is a great size, the cotton one shrank almost to the size of the medium! There's really not much room to grow. Unfortunately this can't be realized until the product is washed and therefore can't be returned. In hindsight, I should have purchased an XL to let him grow into that and if it shrank then no big deal. Overall, love HALO Sleep Sacks... just hate that this one shrunk (although the medium cotton sleep sack didn't...)! And I wash everything in cold water, low heat drying."
5,"Yes it's big, but still a great product",So happy we decided to get this sleep sack. Even though I read the reviews about these running big I still went with an large and even ordered an XL to have has a backup for when our little one gets bigger. My almost 6 month old began to roll over in his sleep and this sleep sack gives me peace of mind. No worries about him getting wrapped up in a blanket. The cotton is soft & adds the perfect amount of warmth to his footie pj's.
2,NOT the same quality as the fleece one!,"I loved the fleece version of this and bought the cotton one for summer. Big mistake. Don't waste your money. The cotton is not pre-shrunk, so when you wash it the first time and it shrinks, the zipper ends up being too long, which causes the fabric to gather/bunch up. Very disappointed."
2,too light-weight,"I love this product in the fleece, but this is so light-weight. It defeats the purpose."
5,great for bedtime,"I dress the baby in this sleep sack every night. It has room for him to move his legs, and now in the winter, I dress him in a long-sleeved onsie underneath. (I use the fleece one now and will change to a cotton one in the warmer months.) I like the zipper too -- very easy for diaper changes in the wee hours."
5,Sleep Blanket,"These Halo Sleepsacks are great! You can sleep peacefully knowing your baby is warm and is not going to suffocate under a blanket. Make sure to check the length and weight limitations before ordering. Although my son was well within the weight limitations for the small, he outgrew it due to his length within a matter of weeks. He now has mediums!"
5,Great product,"We love these sleep sacks. They are safe, comfortable, and let our baby wiggle and move without the worry that she could somehow hurt herself."
5,Excellent,"I love this sleep sack. It's the perfect weight to put over fleece PJs in winter or cotton PJs in summer. My daughter likes to put it on. I purchased the largest size even though she's 18 months as I wanted her to grow into it. The size is fine for her and sits on her shoulders without slipping off. The zipper that zips from the top down is an excellent design idea. Overall, I think it will last for many washes and is a great product."
1,Sleep sacks are DANGERIOUS!,"When I first started using a sleep sack I really liked it because my child loved to be rapped up. Now I will never use one again. Don't be fooled, your baby can still suffocate wearing one of these. Yesterday I bought the medium sleep sack do to the fact that my child out grew his small one. While he was sleeping he somehow got the sleepsack up over his nose. If I hanldnt woken up, he very easily could have suffocated. I will never use any type of sleep sack again. The risk is to much. Just because sleepsack fight SIDS, doesn't mean it isn't the cause in some cases. Be very careful using a sleepsack! They most definitely are not risk free!"
5,Works great for us,The sleep sack has really worked well for our child. Usually she doesn't let a blanket stay on through the night and then can get cold. The sleepsack (we bought the largest size available) gives her plenty of room to move around and yet keeps her cozy. I bought 2 just to have a spare one.
3,Not worth it if baby stands up already,"My baby already stands up so this gets on his way when he awakes up in the crib. The item is nicely made, but I would only use it on younger babies."
5,A Classic,"A very useful book for the home gardener, Master Gardener and/or the professional horticulturist.Everything you ever wanted to know about most woody plants in the USA."
5,Delighted with DIRR,"Excellent, excellent reference book for anyone who wants to read, learn, teach themself or others about trees and shrubs. i use this book as my daily refence guide whether on a landscape project or working at the nursery. The depth and correctness of the information and drawings makes this book a must-buy for anyone serious about horticulture and landscape management."
3,manual of woody landscape plants,"Very technical, no photos, not for the average gardener. Good for seriously advanced applications. Colored photos would help this publication. Information contained is very precise and accurate, but illustrations are simple line drawings."
5,The Woody Plant Bible! A must have!,This was a textbook for a class while persuing my Horticulture degree. This is a definate must have for anyone who is serious about woody plant ID and/or plant knowledge. This book coupled with the pictoral book are invaluable to any landscape or gardening enthusiast as well as the BIBLE to the industry worker!
5,A guide for the serious gardener.,Dirr's Manual of Woody Landscape Plants is an invaluable resource for any serious gardener. I have used earlier editions for many years and have given copies of the latest edition to my children.
3,Directory of woody cultivars,"In spite of all the accolades heaped upon this directory of woody cultivars it is not without a downside. The sturdy size and thick paper which make it stand up to horticulturally engaged hands make for a clumsy book at home or in the library. Not much thought was given to lay-out and typography, with the wrong font chosen for this lay-out. The style of writing is rather dry and a little wordy. The nurseryman's indifference to spelling shines through often enough to make me ache for a corrector's pencil.The cover claims ""Identification"" as a primary function of the book, but all the 'Manual' has to offer here is looking up a supposed identity and making a comparison. Pictorial support is quite limited (usually one line-drawing per species, mostly of a single leaf).What this book does offer is the chance to quickly look up an unfamiliar cultivar, and this is why reviewers call it a ""Bible"". Any use beyond that will be a bonus."
1,Buyer Beware,We received a rather terse note on returning from our vacationabout not emailing a response back. The book was in HORRIBLE shape. His description of the 'worn ' appearance was wishful thinking. He did not email us and tell us that a credit had been issued . I found that out by followup. I can't say the 'near'service we received was very good.
3,Nothing new,"k.. If you don't posses the Van Richten's Guide books this is it! , but, if you are one of the freaks who mannage to get their hands on the original books, don't bother!"
1,"Without literary or educational merit, promotes obesity",I found this book to be without literary or educational merit. An older sister takes advantage of her younger brother while he hides and shoves chocolate in his face. This is easily in the bottom 10% of all children's books.
3,I'd recommend library-reading it first,"I found this Max book to be mean-spirited. My kids own just about all the other Max books and we enjoy them. My son can sing some of them (to his own tune) and my one-year-old could recite passages from a few of the board books.I like Max as a mischievous child, but in this one he seemed a little nastier than I felt comfortable sharing with my children. He breaks the rules and gets away with it. This isn't a hands-down non-recommendation of this particular book, but parents ought to be forewarned and maybe preview the book for free from the library before buying it. All of the other Max books are keepers and re-readers, but I found that for my particular household, this book was not a keeper even though we have thoroughly enjoyed all the others."
3,Cute..but disjointed.,The illustrations are cute but the story left my 3 year old with questions. Max steals the chocolate chicken during the Easter egg hunt and eats it all by himself. No redeeming values from this one.
5,Great Book!,This book was so cute! It reminded me so much of me and my one sister. I used to always find her candy and sneak a piece or two (she took forever to eat hers!). My sisters and I all love each other and we're extremely close. Kids will be kids and have their little antics--that's what gives us times to look back on. It is also what makes us so close to each other. This book is one we read every single day during the Easter Season!
2,Creepy,"This is the only book in the series that I've read and while my daughter seems to like it, my wife and I find it indescribably creepy. The Easter Bunny is kind of bizarre and looks like the kind of person you should NOT accept candy from. Max is disobedient and his sister is arrogant. If there's a character here that we should like, I'm not seeing it. The illustrations aren't cute, they're just sort of... off."
4,Illustration Are Nice - But......,"Well of course, you would not expect a bunny to have a chocolate rabbit - would you?It is egg-hunting morning and Max and Ruby are out early wanting to win the grand prize of the chocolate chicken. Ruby explains that the person who finds the most eggs gets the chicken. Easy-peazy, or so it seems.Why looks for eggs when there is so much more to see like mud puddles and acorns. As Ruby gathers eggs, Max finds spoons and ants.Max still wants that chicken but has a plan that does not involve looking for eggs.Not a very good plan and I am sure that parents will have a hard time explaining to their young children how you can have a happily ever after ending when stealing is involved.The illustrations are colorful and engaging, just not sure that the overall theme is something that most parents would want to read to their children."
2,Dissapointing,"I thought this was one story involving several characters, but it is 3 short stories. Very short. Too short to be realistic with the characters falling in love and getting married in unrealistic time. So if that doesn't bother you..."
3,"If you like these guys, check out Esquevator!!!!!","For a truly magical music experience, check out the laid back contemporary stylings of Esquevator. 50 minutes of all your favorite esquevez songs played in relaxing Muzak form. Wonderful music for all occasions."
5,"Outstanding recording!!! A local-band ""must-have""","Esquevez is one of the really great ""local band"" sounds in recent memory! This album shows the way to good musicianship, and tight vocals..."
5,Delightful Album!,"A fine collection of Song Book standards and a few covers that were new to me. I thoroughly enjoyed her smooth, assured voice, and some inspired scat.Don't miss Moondance!"
5,Bronze should soon be Platinum!!,"Much love and support goes out to Bronze. He truly represented the Wu and Gun Ru to the fullest. Everyone who loves Wu-Tang will love this album. If you don't add this to your Wu collection, it's not complete. Bronze brings his own style, yet maintains the amazing artistry of all of the Wu fam. Bronze is socially conscious and articulate, definitely bringing back the vibe of Hip Hop, not Hip Pop.Bronze, keep doin' your thang, God Bless. -Buddah King from the South House Click, Gun Ru representin'..."
3,Where's Choco?,"When I first bought this album I thought I was gonna go crazy it was so dope. Excellent lyricist and good Wu-Tang style beats. Everything was pretty much on point. There's a few songs that I don't like, but he has a good balance of spittin hard and songs with messages without being preachy.But the one unforgivable sin of this CD is the poor sound quality. The beats would be really great if there wasn't distortion when I put the volume up loud. Especially on the beats with horns. I have a good quality amp, stereo and speakers, so I know its not my equipment. I've also listened to it in headphones and that makes the poor sound even worst. Besides the Wu-Tang meet Indie Culture, this is the only Bronze Nazareth piece I have. I hope his future works have an actual engineer like the great Choco. If it were not for the poor sound, this CD would have easily been 4 stars. Its a great CD, but I hate listening to poor sound, it ruins the whole vibe of an otherwise great album."
4,Entertaining Suspense,"A fast-paced enjoyable read with many twists. Not Ms Spindler's best, IMO, but entertaining just the same."
5,Fantastic read,"I have read most of Erica Spindler's books, and this one is a keeper. You love the characters - Ms. Spindler makes them come alive. The book was really hard to put down. It was very well written with tons of suspense. I loved it!"
4,This is not a ROMANTIC suspense,"Do not confuse this book with other Erica Spindler books. It is not a romance. It is suspenseful and does surprise you at the end. Even when you think you know what's going to happen, she puts a good spin on it. It was suspenseful and did keep me reading, but if you are looking for a ROMANTIC suspense, you will be disappointed with ""See Jane Die."" ALso, try to avoid reading the discription of this book on the back. It gives too much away and you know exactly what is going to happen. All in all it was a good read."
5,first read,"I belong to a book club in Thibodaux, LA. One of the first books we read was See Jane Die, over a year ago. It is still one of our favorites. We all agree that is exciting to read a book and not be able to predict the ending. Erica Spindler does a great job at keeping you guessing. We read that she was in our area for a book signing and tried to see if she could come to visit with us, but our schedules were not in ""sync."" However, one of her associates informed us that she did do phone conferences, so we planned on doing that when we read her next book."
2,Huh? Just awful!,"I know this is light reading and I know that serious suspense isn't this author's goal, at least I don't think so, but this story was lame to the enth degree. The ending was absolutely awful. I liked the character, sort of, and I liked her sister, sort of, but come on.........this whole story was so obvious as to who was doing these things and then,the really bad guy, what a lame excuse for him being bad..............totally off the wall and not worthy of the good buildup that the book had. I was so disappointed in this lame ending but I still like the author's books. I just wish she would give us surprise endings in her books, please!"
3,I felt cheated,"This review is for the Mira Books paperback edition, undated, 397 pages of story. SEE JANE DIE was on the USA Today's Top 150 Best-Selling books list for four in June 2005, reaching the peak position of 31. Erica Spindler has seven novels on the USA Today best-seller list.When she was fifteen years old, a hit and run speedboat disfigured Jane Killian face. Now at thirty-one years with her face restored she is beautiful, a talented sculptress, wealthy and happily married to a plastic surgeon, Ian. Jane's blissful life disintegrates at freefall speed after the police arrest Ian for killing one of his patients. Even Jane's sister Stacy, a police detective, thinks Ian is guilty.SEE JANE DIE is dubbed a ""romantic thriller."" The mystery murder plot is overlaid with the romance novel formula. Still, the plot kept me guessing as to how things would sort out. In the end, two characters had to abruptly change their character, which is a darn lazy way to solve a mystery. I felt cheated."
2,Plain Jane in plain mystery.,"Very simplistic writing with no literary flair whatsoever in this thoroughly mundane ""no mystery"" mystery. The heroine Jane is weak and crying and then tough and strong...she changes her wildly out of control emotions by the hour. The plot is startlingly obvious from the beginning and even the red herrings are. Some also very obvious grammatical errors are interspersed through out this very ordinary book. The story chugs on to the expected ending and fortunately it is quick. It is a fast and easy read but where's the beef ? It is not a horrible book but it is a little too boring to be judged a good read. I hope her other books are better."
5,All Real Slice Of Time!!!,"Like the previous review, I was ""shocked"" to see that ""The Fool"" had been released on CD. I was introduced to this album in 1973 by a friend who asked me if I wanted to hear something really unusual. This has the Sixties written all over it. I was able to obtain an LP in 1976 by special order which is now gathering dust. Contemporary music listeners may merely find this quaint. It is quite trippy and reflects an aspect of the 1960s that has come and gone for almost forty years. None the less I ordered The Fool yesterday."
4,"Like it Or Not, It's Different!","Like two other reviewers, I couldn't believe that this is still listed on Amazon.com. When I started to convert my more than a thousand LP records to digital, this is one of the first ones I converted. Then, I combined it with an now obscure 'Moogie Woogie' album by The Zeet Band, and with Hot Butter's 'Popcorn' album to make a truly different listening experience. 'The Fool' gives complementary vocals to the Moog sound. I think my grandchildren will love to hear it once in a while when they get bored with the 'packaged pop' that passes for music today. If you can't climb out of your 'packaged pop pit,' forget this CD; if you want to taste something different, try it. I still have my LP after nearly forty years; it was worth keeping.[Popcorn is still listed: http://www.amazon.com/Popcorn-Hot-Butter/dp/B0009VJWS6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s;=music&qid;=1236565429&sr;=1-1]"
1,Worst album ever?,"I would give this no stars if that option were available. The only interesting thing about this album is that it is mentioned by Thomas Pynchon in Gravity's Rainbow. Amateurish, pseudo-psychedelic pseudo-folk of the cheesiest, silliest, most inane and cloying sort. Do not listen to this album. It may be hazardous to your mental health, especially if you attempt it with trendy chemical amusment aid. No redeeming value on any level, even as an artifact of silly psychedelia. When I had to move I threw it in the dumpster."
2,Just OK,"Another just OK. He has a great voice, but the songs are just bla bla bla. If I could send back, I would."
2,very boring book,"I had to buy it for my Educational Evaluation class. It is very boring to read. It is stuffed with annoying quotes, and repeats the same thing over and over.Very few examples of how to shift from teacher-centered to learner-centered method of teaching..."
2,Not impressed,"My daughter used Dr. Brown's Newborn Feeding Set for my grand daughter when she was born. I was not impressed with this product what so ever. My grand daughter suffered from gas and had ear aches. I wouldn't recommend this bottle for anyone who did not have a dishwaser. The inside component is a thin straw like devise. I was never content with the cleanliness of this straw since you couldn't even get water to flow through it, let alone a bottle brush. I used Playtex bottles and neither one of my children suffered from gas and ear problems as my grand daughter did. I wouldn't reccomend this product. My daughter is expecting another baby and these are not going to be the bottle of choice for the new child."
2,Not so great,My baby is very gassy and also has reflux and i didn't see any difference with these bottle then with the playtex ones. Too much to clean and not that great.
1,Not Happy with these,I bought these for my daughter and they did not do a thing to help her digestive problems. She had colic and cried for 22 hours straight. These bottles was a waste of my money. I still use them because I wasted so much money on them even though they did not help the colic at all. She is older now and I am thinking of changing to a simple bottle. I dont like the way you have to prepare formula in these you have to stir it not shake it. I also e-mailed Dr Brown to let them know about my dissatisfaction and they never replied to me at all. I called them and I had a rude lady tell me that unless I had a receipt there was nothing that they could do. I explained I didnt want any money I just wanted to let them know how unhappy I was.
3,The nipple is not very good,"The nipple spills the milk out even when the baby is falling asleep or resting and so his/her mouth gets full of milk causing him/her a problem. I do not know if it is really effective for colics for all babies but if your baby does not have an important colic problem, you would rather use the Pigeon bottles (japanese technology) with special nipples for peristaltic movement which is the smooth wave-like lapping movement of a baby's tongue that naturally draws milk from a mother's nipple. These nipples do not spill out milk and the milk only flows if the baby wants to drink and makes this movement. I used Pigeon bottles with my first baby and now, with my second baby, I tried the Dr. Browns bottles because the doctor recommended them but I felt more satisfied with the Pigeon peristaltic nipples. So I changed the nipples and now I am using the Dr Brown's bottles with the standard neck Pigeon nipples."
2,Be careful re what you buy,These transparent style it turns out are NOT BPA-free. Stick with the translucent polypropylene BPA-free ones.
1,Not worth the effort,"We tried several different brands of bottles. Dr. Browns failed us on several levels. 1) My son gasped and burped the most using Dr. Browns 2) they are a pain in the neck to clean. Playtex dropins worked well in preventing burping, but are a pain when mixing formula. The best of the bunch was Avent. Avent occasionally leaks, but I'll take that over a burpy/fussy baby AND they are easy to clean and easy to mix formula in."
2,THERE OK. BUT A PAIN,"These bottles were great at first... then after a few weeks you get tired of cleaning the parts, because there are just WAY to many. But I did it...and i was ready to buy more. But then I started to notice that the paint chips off when you sterilize the bottles...and the paint ended up inside of the bottle... well as a new mom that bugged me and I threw the bottles away b/c I didn't want my son drinking milk with the paint chips in it. But besides all that they are great bottles...he took the milk pretty well in them...But they just scared me with the paint. I recently purchased THE FIRST YEARS SOOTHIE BOTTLE..AND IT WORKS GREAT!"
1,doesn't reduce gas,"I bought this set for my brother's baby. I read the reviews from amazon before I purhcased this newborn feeding set, and believed that it would help reduce gas. My brother's baby is one month old now and have been using the feeding set since birth. Surprisingly, my brother was informed by the doctor that the baby has a lot gas. Is this feeding set supposed to reduce gas?"
1,Leaky Bottle,I read the reviews regarding the leaking problem and thought that those individuals just didnt read/follow the instructions properly. However they were right!! After re-reading how to assemble the bottle and and making sure not exceeded the recommended fluid levels these bottles STILL LEAKED!! Even when tighted. Please do not waste your money on these bottles.
2,not great bottles,"My baby hated the nipple, and still got gas, more with this bottle than any other I tried. Luckly I got this as a gift and didn't spend my own money on them. Not worth it."
4,Bottles good but not forever,"I AM NOT A KID, I JUST DIDNT HAVE AN EMAIL ADDRESS TO SUPPLY. I have just had my first daughter who is now 3 months old and i used the dr. browns bottles. they do work but my daughter would sometimes get a little gassy when she was little. im just about to stop using them because she is old enough to use evenflo bottles and she isnt half as gassy or spitty uppy. besides, those bottles are a bitch to wash. it took me about 20 minutes to wash three of them! playtex...doesnt work...those darn inserts are annoying too...it says to squeeze them and all the air will come out, it does not! its too hard! you cant stick your fingers all the way up there...that sounds wrong doesnt it. well anyways, the moral of this is to use dr. browns for the first 3 months and than switch to something more easier."
1,they are a horrible company horrible product,"I used dr browns.bottles for two weeks after my lo was born. However although they claim dishwasher safe after 4 washings ( top rack) and there were 4 other types of bottles in the dishwasher, they came oyt with the awful smell of burning plastic. No other bottle kept that smell, it permeated my home for days!!! I contacted the company as i had over 30 bottles and was told i did something wrong, they even sent me a copy of their instructions and told me to send all thebottles back. I asked what they were goimg to do and they offered me a 3 pack of their bottles in exchange for my 30. It was offensive and disgraceful. Their rep was condescending and rude and after we hung up she emailed me the same offensive info. Disgraceful company. Thank god my child didnt drink from these as he could have gotten sick. The smell in the air was awful enough!!"
5,Only bottles I ever want to use!!,These bottles are the best. I read reviews on all the bottles and picked these as the bottles to use on my son after all the good reviews. And they work great. Only pain is they take more time to clean. So I tried Avent because of less parts to clean but they leaked and my son has a had time getting formula from the nipple. So I realized I need to just clean those extra parts and stick with Dr.Browns bottles.
4,One question -- Is this thing made in glass?,Many friends recommended this brand. But one question -- is this set made in glass or plastic? I did not see this curtail info on the page. And called amazon customer service. They cannot tell either. They suggest me put a review here to ask others.
5,Best Bottles Hands Down!!,These are the best bottles ever. The unique design cuts down on the amount of gas your baby swallows. This leads to less spit up and gas fussiness. Just a good healthy burp!The bottles are easy to clean and assemble and clean up well in the dishwasher. I'd suggest the Dr Brown's bottle drying rack as well. It will make the job much easier.
3,"Great Idea, Pain for new sleep deprived parents to clean",My lacatation specialist recommended these bottles for our daughter. i liked the slim design of the bottle but have come to hate cleaning the inserts in these bottles. For every one Doc Brown bottle I clean it is as if I have ceaned two regular bottles. For new parents the time spent cleaning all the lilttle pieces is a big stressor. The Playtex collapsable bottles are just as good and are quicker and easier to clean.
3,Logo paint falls off,"Careful, if you boil them, the logo paint falls off, leaving traces in the other items you are cleaning.Besides that, excellent bottle, my baby loves it."
4,Paint chips off,"I really like these bottles, they do help my son with gas. I've been using them for almost 3 months now and the paint is chipping off. I hand wash them, put them in the dish washer and use a bottle warmer. I'm pretty sure it's from the bottle warmer. It's getting annoying since the paint gets all over my hands. Otherwise these are great bottles."
5,Give these a try,"My son is now 3 weeks old. He is a larger baby with a huge appetite. After dealing with weeks of gas and spit up, I bought a set of these bottles. These bottles are fantastic when compared to regular bottles. I have definitely noticed a decrease in burping and fussiness after eating. Do yourself a favor and buy the biggest set you can find. I have had to buy two newborn sets and I threw all of my ""regular"" bottles away."
4,Great Bottles for Gas/Colic Problems,"Tried Playtex Ventaire with my first child and they were awful and should be taken off the market. Tried Dr. Brown's with my second child after many of my friends recommendations. My child had ""super colic"" for the first 4 months and the bottles did relieve the gas very much. Time just had to relieve the rest. For those of you complaining about not being able to shake up the bottle when using powder formula for fear it will clog - try using a tea spoon to stir it first and then put lid on and shake. I did this and never had a problem with clogs.As far as the complaints of ""too many parts"". I just disassemble and throw in washer. No problem!"
4,I Agree With the others! :-),"Another online reviewer, stated she used Dr. Browns with Similac advanced formula. I do the same and everything has been perfect. I too considered changing my formula, but didn't need to, I needed to change my bottles. i was using Playtex Vent Air. ( those nipples stink!) He was extremley gassy, and now with Dr.Browns his gas is relieved. I did have a leaking problem, but that was my fault. You need to close the bottles tight, make sure the nipple is fastened properly. Which isnt a big chore. In addition, as a first time mom I was heating my bottle up with the nipple and all the parts still on the bottle. Which caused explosions and leaking! So dont be a dummy like me!"
1,BPA unacceptable,"These bottles contain bisphenol-A, as do many other baby bottles on the market. This is irresponsible on the part of the manufacturers, and the only way things will change is by purchasing BPA free products. Check out the Z report to see which products are safe."
3,Disappointed in Dr. Brown's Bottles,"My grandaughter suffers from an acid reflux problem. In searching for a bottle that would help ease her symptoms, I came across Dr. Brown's Bottles. After reading the reviews, I was excited to think that I had found a bottle that would truly help her. I purchased the newborn feeding set to get her started, hoping that the reviews I had read about the bottles were in fact true. Unfortunately, the bottles made her problems worse. Her spitting up and gasiness increased and I ultimately had to return to her original bottles. I am upset and found Dr. Brown's to be a waste of money."
2,Does not seem to reduce gas,"Our little one has grown out of the gas, and we thought we'd give these a go, after using the Playtex nurser system for her (she's mainly breastfed, but I'm going back to work soon). These bottles gave her more gas than the Playtex nurser collapsible liners, although I guess it depends upon how your baby feeds. Ours gets right down to business, and protests strongly if you take her off to burp her until she reaches a certain level of fullness, so it's important that the bottles do not generate gas. Dr Brown's bottles do seem to generate gas, and they are fiddly to clean. We won't be using these again. On the plus-side, you can pump straight from a Medela pump into the bottles, which is handy, and means slightly less waste, I suppose."
5,Best for baby,"After buying one bottle of every brand sold..to find out which would work for my son, I found Dr.Browns to be the absolute BEST! Yes they are a pain to clean with the vents but your baby will not be screaming in pain from gas after eating...really these work! When the vents get nasty I just toss them and buy the replacements..they aren't that expensive!"
1,Hard to clean,"These are very hard to clean and the nipples collapse constantly. The best bottles and nipples are the Avent bottles. After buying every bottle out there, we settled on those because they are stable, easy to clean, and the nipple doesn't flatten on every other minute."
5,Very highly recommend these bottles,"These bottles saved my son's tummy. He wore a Pavlic Harness for the first 2 months of his life so he was unable to move and stretch out his legs enough to allow his bowels to function properly. After screaming for 2 weeks straight we finally tried these bottles and found the solution to his discomfort. We kept using these bottles all the way up until he was 15 months old and weened from the bottle entirely. They did cost more than the other bottles, but for us it was well worth it. There was never a bubble in the nipple and the seals stayed tight. I gave these 4 stars only because we don't own a dishwasher so the washing was hard to keep up with, having so many parts. If we had a dishwasher it would've been 5 stars, easily. However, I would recommend purchasing a larger quantity of bottles so washing does not become an issue."
2,Leaks like crazy. Doesn't help with colic,"I got this set as a shower gift and was quite impressed at first. Then when the colic set in, I started to use these bottles. All they did was leak like crazy on to my sons face. It made no difference with the colic. I really do not like these bottles, they are a pain to clean and I always find them leaking all over my diaper bag too. Save your money.. Ventaire works better! Atleast for me."
1,aweful bottle,Do not buy this bottle it is horriable. It is hard to clean and did not help my first son when he was coliky. Save your money.
4,"Great, will buy again","I loved these bottles. The paint did chip on my bottles as well, and at first I didn't like washing all the parts - I then used the dish washer and really was pleased with these. I advise that if you bottle feed full time, you purchase at least 8 bottles. This cut down on my hand washing and allowed more time for me to ""relax"". The nipples also fit on the Medula Breastpump bottles. This was a nice perk in a pinch. My son was not gassy with these bottles - He took to them easily. I did not experience leaking unless I forgot to put in the straw and rubber top - sleep deprivation did that from time to time! Buy with confidence"
2,Dissapointed,"I was disapointed in the Dr. Brown's bottles. I had researched them prior to having my first child and thought they would be great. Olivia is now five months and I am fed up with these bottles they leak, the ounce markers, numbers and writting are chipping off. I will say that she is not a very gassy baby, which could be a result of the bottles, but for the price I expected a better quality."
3,Concerned Mommy,"This is truly a good bottle. My baby did not have gas or bottle leakage (as with another leading brand). HOWEVER, my problem is with the paint chipping/peeling off of the bottles. I purchased 12 bottles and now 10 of them are virtually without paint on them. I wash these bottles in very hot water and very small paint fragments tend to attach themselves on to nipples, pacifiers, etc. Although I rinse all items thoroughly - small paint fragments may be missed. This concerns me because I sincerely hope my child has not ingested any of this paint. Simply stated - (the paint on) this bottle may not be able to withstand very high heat."
5,Our latin thing (Nuestra cosa latina),"Seen in the 70's in Puerto Rico. Great documentary about the latinos (especially puertorricans). It brings a lot of memories of costumbres & salsa greats. I have been looking for more than 20 years & I can not find it. Hope they decide to put the movie on the market again. I am completely sure that is going to sell like ""pan caliente"". Ah the 70's ,wished I could stayed living there. There was a lot more of respect & morals. A whole different atmosphere."
3,"Some Classic footage, but not worth it.","Well let's see, where do I start; the movie is poorly transfered on to DVD, the colors seem like you need 3D glasses to get any type of focus going on. Also, the sound seems as if it's comming out of a tin can. Having said that there is some classic Salsa stuff on here, like Larry Harlow wearing a Kosher shirt in the Bronx, just kidding a few of the pioneers belt it out and that makes this thing worth whatever it is I paid for it. If this is remastered than I'd hate to see the none remastered version."
4,Old times video,"THis video is awesome! It take you back to the old times were music, salsa, was everything.Nice to see la fania stars when they were young."
4,Our Latin Thing,The sights and sounds or this film takes me back to my days growing up in NYC.Great film for all nuyorican salsa lovers. Very Cool!
1,Can't play DVD,I purchased this DVD for my husband for Father's day and we can't get it to play in any of our DVD's.
4,Very good gameplay,We really enjoy this game. It gives a new way to play the pokemon world. Our only complaint is its very similar to the red team version. I wouldn't buy both again.
5,Pretty well handled,"The was no plastic seal. Played game and it was functional and genuine, not a knock off.I'm very well satisfied with this product, got exactly what I was told I would get."
5,It is amazing,"This is an amazing game that you need to get now. You can get it fore 6.00 used an amazon! At the end you can evolve and you can always make new friends. When I got this game, I could not stop playing it at all. I am 8 years old and this is what I think about this game."
5,"Awesome Game, Sad Ending","the game itself is pretty easy until you get to the bosses (trust me, i would know) the sad part is the very end of story mode (i cried my eyes out, especially at the credits! and it wasn't because i beat the game) i had to leave my partner, Pikachu but after the credits i cried tears of joy because i got to see my partner again!!!! this is truly a must-have game!! (in case you're wondering, i was a charmander) o and u take a personality quiz to see what pokémon u r at the beginning of the game"
5,Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Blue Rescue Team,My 12 yr old son won't put it down and says the kids on the bus all want it!!
1,Twas ok,It is pretty stupid because you cannot catch pokemon which is one of the biggest things in pokemon. The pokemon dont evolve either and my kids never play the game.
1,Pretty awful game,"We bought three of these games, one each for three members of our family. We have purchased every Pokemon game that has come out in the last decade. Two of us are Pokemon maniacs and one is a casual fan. We spent $100 on three of these games . . .All three of the games were quickly abandoned.This game is terribly boring and repetative. All Pokemon games require you to do combat over and over but the combat is REWARDING. In this game you just wander around in dungeons fighting battles over and over and you hardly get anything for it! Ugh.It might be useful if you have insomnia.This game was a HUGE mis-step and should never have been released."
4,great game,"This game was purchased for my almost 14 year-old son. He said ""its a realy fun game, but after a while it gets kinda repetitive."""
3,not full funny,this game it is not full funny and is other things it is very different than other pokemon game
2,ai stinks,"I have read other reviews about how you can sit back and let the AI take over, unfortunatley mine rarely seem to fight, they just sit, back. Also frequently you have to lug along a really weak pokemon, to ""help rescue a friend"". Unfortunatley these really weak ones DO like to fight and are constantly getting into a battle and getting killed even when you just want to protect them. This is extremely frustrating. A bit more control over the rest of the party would make this game MUCH better."
2,A Disappointment,"Interesting content and great photos, but carelessly written and seemingly not proofread. As a professional writer and editor, I'm flinching at the typos. Only recommended for readers with a serious interest in style and horses, or those obsessed with Jackie O."
2,Not much of an Author,Maybe this book took over two years to be published because the publisher kept returning the script to the author asking her to beef it up a bit....the photo's are good but the book itself is a bit of fluff
4,ODIN ROCKS,"Very interesting read; not enough pages to the book! I wanted to continue reading!! Being drawn into the ""unusual"" by being a student of Dr. Mirabello... I was not disappointed in the least."
2,"Great book, horrid format","Well I pushed through the book, which contains some useful information. The info contained in the book was the only reason I bought it, however, if I had known the book was in such a horrible format I would not have bought it. There were words that could only barely be read because they were all jumbled together. There were also sections missing from the book itself, which made some of the parts of the interview impossible to understand. (unless you have prior knowledge of the subject of the book) Overall it was not some big conspiracy thing, just a general overview of a secretive group."
2,Disappointing,"As a heathen, I was very disappointed in this small yet overpriced little book. There was very little new information, very little explanation of the information discussed, and nothing in the book was verifiable. It took me less than an hour to read, and felt let down at the end.An Odinic secret society that has survived for several centuries is absurd. Secrets and initiations are for the neo-pagans, not for heathens. Secret cults are cowards, hiding their faces and feelings from the rest of society. Cowardice is not a virtue of Odinism.This book was somewhat entertaining, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one. I would not recommend this book to anyone new to Odinism. In fact, I would not recommned this book to anyone."
3,It takes all kinds...,"If you prefer your Odinism served with an a exotic side dish of occultism and secret society mystagoguery-here it is!But be forewarned, Prof. Mirabello is not nearly as entertaining as Carlos Castaneda.Bon Apetite!"
3,Good or Bad?,"Okay so the book has some nice information about northern european heathenism, However the idea of an ancient secret society is an utter load. All the so called ""facts"" about this group that the book presents are just conspiracy theory nonsense. I would say buy the book if you already own other more important books on Asatru and Northern European Heathenism. Its a sad shame that in a religion with as much tradition as Asatru that people still think they need some historical validation in the way the wiccans do."
5,Lectura Obligatoria,"Me pregunto quién está cobrando un sueldo en Alfaguara (y en otras editoriales en castellano) para dedicarse a la difusión de los libros que publican.Éste es probablemente uno de los tres o cuatro mejores libros de la literatura latinoamericana del siglo veinte. Abarca toda la vida literaria de Onetti (el primer cuento de este tomo fue publicado en los años '30; el último en los '80 ). Lo que es increíble es que desde el arranque Onetti ya es un escritor maduro. No hay tropiezos de principiante; ningún cuento sobra; cada uno crea su propio orbe y estilo, mezcla de prosa poética, discusión de bar y observación precisa del mundo.Igual que Rulfo, igual que Borges, Onetti es lectura obligatoria para todo aquel que entienda un mínimo de castellano. Y para todos aquellos que se desviven por Rayuela, de Cortázar, ¿en quién creen que está basada la figura del genial escritor Morelli? Morelli-Monelli-Onelli-Onetti."
3,Fine shirt for the money.,"This is a fine shirt for the money. The material is pretty ""light weight"" - which is alright I suppose. Something heavier would maybe last longer - but it would be - well - heavier. I was trying to find something with just the classic Yellow - red - green - and black colors of Africa - and this is the closest I found - and I am not totally behind the ""purple"" and ""blue"" accents - but I wore it last night and several people ""liked"" it. I would consider buying another one. It is fine."
1,Poor Quality,"When I received the Traditional Print Unisex Dashiki in Yellow, it had numerous stains on it. I asked for a replacement dashiki and received a second dashiki with stains on the outside and massive staining on the inside of the garment. I was very disappointed. I have returned the garment and I am awaiting a full refund."
4,nice dashiki,I like the dashiki fine but I had trouble ordering it. I telephoned Amazon customer service and was connected to a woman who was obviously in some other country. She had no idea what I was talking about and the order process took a lot of frustration. HIRE AMERUCANS!
5,a surpise find,"came across this dashiki while looking for something else.african inspired. cotton, great for summer. choice of colors.a good surpise."
2,"Definitely the most firm hold, but not usable","I ordered a number of different shapewear pieces, and of all of them, this definitely had the firmest hold: A strong fabric that's not overly stretchy. It was easy to put on too, not at all sticky. Unfortunately, the item was way too short, with the bra band ending up two inches below my breasts, pulling them down, and pulling very hard on my shoulders even with the shoulder straps lengthened as far as they'll go. The cups also give you what I like to call 'pyramid breast syndrome'. Not flattering."
5,"A ""must-read"" for Wiccans in or out of the closet!","Living between the Worlds is an excellent book for Wiccans who must everday balance their mundane and magickal lives. This book is very enlightening for those of us who choose to stay ""in the closet"" and for those who are ""out"". It reconciles both types and gives understanding and real life reasoning for both choices.It even gives another meaning to the Rede - ""don't do magickally what you would not do mundanely"". Definitely something to ponder when deciding ""to harm none""."
5,Excellent Book,"This is a well-written, fast-paced book that sheds an important light on relief work, its benefits and its risks. I knew very little about the floods in Somalia, and this was a great lesson as to what I missed.Great read. You won't be disappointed."
2,not worth it,"I bought these for my baby daughter's Christmas photo shoot and she had the ivory pair on for a total of about 45 minutes and the tights already look like they've been through a war. She doesn't even sit up or crawl yet, but these still got snags and runs and pilling just from having them on for a photo shoot. :("
1,Holes in tights,Two of the three pairs of tights had Several small holes in them when I took them out of the package. The holes were not huge but I still did not want to put them on my daughter because who knows if they would have just kept getting bigger throughout the day! Very disappointing.
1,They are small.,Too tight and also short for my 3 month old. I dont like them at all.I wish i didnt order these.
2,Way too big!,"I bought this for my daughter to wear when she was between 0 and 9 month clothing. My children are by no mean small, and these were WAY TOO LONG on her. We had to stuff the excess into her shoes."
2,Wrong colors,"We did not get white pink black, we got 2 pink and 1 white color. Very annoying. Very, very annoying."
2,weird size/shape,"PROS: they are fairly thick and very soft.CONS: 0-9 mos is an incredibly wide size range. I bought these for my 4 month old and they are somewhat tight around her tummy, (she's avg. weight) LONG in the legs (she's in the 95th % for her height...) and incredibly baggy around the ankle. There is no taper and they could not be hiked up enough to look nice. There was tons of excess material stuffed in her shoe and it looked really bad.I will hang on to them to see how they might fit her in the future, but for now I am not impressed."
3,Too Big,Bought these for my 3 month old and they were way too big in the legs and feet. She is small for her age and I assume they fit most babies her age.
3,3-pack Tights for Baby 0-9 months,"It said it was from 0-9 months, however they are huge for my one month old Grandbaby, they'd say 4-9 months insted."
3,The product did run big,I have a infant that wears a 6 month size and it was very big--the tights were very nice .
1,Crap,"Rubbish material, not 100% cotton or if they are its an odd type of cotton. I was displeased with this product."
2,Not too good,This are so light and easy to have runs...Easy to wash and wear but easy to get look worn out.
1,Pretty disappointed,"These should be described as ""9-12 months"" because I don't see how a baby any smaller than that would fit these. I bought these for my daughter to wear for the holidays but the tights, UNSTRETCHED, are just about as long as she is and she is about a month old. I hate dealing with returns, so I'm going to have to give these away to someone with an older girl."
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!,"I did a lot of research on this software and thought it looked great. I also made sure it would work on my Windows 7 and it stated it would, but what they fail to tell you is that is won't work on 64-bit!! Now I have to send it back and pay for the return, the company will only pay for the refund on the software. Not happy!!"
2,Lousy support - funky working program,"I have used other Novadevelopment programs, Video Explosion which worked pretty good and support was decent so I gave no thought to buying this one.What a mistake. Several support emails and NOT one reply.Program seems to have issues with the fonts and how the look. I use the same font and the text looks different. Alignment is off of the words and you can't get it straight.Go with Hanes Tshirt maker instead."
2,"Flimsy, Thin, and low quality","These are so thin, they are almost transparent and my daughter hated them. They also did not look like the picture, there was no dark gold fabric around the medallion.What a waste!"
2,Thread-bare and Larger-sized,"I was hoping that my 3-yr old daughter could use these shoes for her dance class. Since she is young and just starting out, she doesn't need ""professional"" shoes. So, I thought these would just be fun for her. They are certainly JUST for dress up and for older children (7-9 yr old).I would not call them a 1 size fits all because there really isn't stretch or give to them like you would imagine a 1-size item would. The slipper just falls off when my smaller child walks in them.The fabric is a ""fancy"" fabric with a low thread-count, so you can see right through the shoe with no additional shape/support on the bottom. Just picture a sheer fabric sewn together with a big button on the top."
4,Bought for granddaughter !,"She is only 2, but I thought I would give them a try, they were to big, but, well made, and will keep for dress-up time! Seller was fast when I paid overnight delivery!"
3,Nice,These were nice but I thought they would be a little smaller. However shipment was received quickly and with no problems.
3,Works,"These worked okay and were cute, but there were holes in the bottom by the end of the night. They worked for what we needed, just not gonna last long."
4,worth the money,"Shipping was really fast. Faster than the estimated time. It was worth the money. The slippers r durable, brightly colored, and the ankle strap is further back so they still stay on smaller feet. It says one size fits all but its really a girls size 10-11. My daughter wears a size 8 and they stay on. The fabric is like a thin sock with a no-slip-grip bottom."
5,Strong Offering Here,"I owned the original Montrose album years ago. I had never heard any of the later tunes, but this CD is a strong testament to his endurance and quality. I started playing the CD and was surprised that there were so many songs that sounded like I should know them, but I had never heard before (if that makes sense). The songs are strong, production is great and the sound is big. If you listen to 70s guitar rock and you wish you could find some more music besides the same old songs that classic rock stations WEAR OUT, give this one a try."
3,"Meaty, beaty, ode to the way we were","Some real guitar talent here, several good cuts, a couple that are better than that, and several others that are a very far stretch for a ""best of"" compilation. As with BTO, great for jump starting a dance party, playing while you travel, or reminiscing about where you were during the rock and roll era. Absent are the long-lived qualities or depth associated with Hendrix, Clapton or Trower. Not something you haul out for intimate gatherings of your best friends. You might enjoy this CD for awhile, and then you will rotate it out."
4,Ronnie Montrose - Guitar Slinger,"The first Montrose album was one of several that rocked my high school world, with Ronnie Montrose emerging as a serious contender for guitar god honors. But it seems as if something happened to derail his career somewhere along the way (Poor management? Record company apathy?). For the uninitiated, this is a good place to start, featuring all of the essential tracks from that glorious first slab of vinyl as well as most of the highlights from the rest. Fans of 1970's hard rock, however, would be wise to hunt down the original releases as well, even though vocalist Sammy Hagar left the band after ""Paper Money."" Loses one star for failing to include ""O Lucky Man"" from ""Warner Brothers Presents...""."
3,Best in WHOSE opinion?,"Shame on whoever decided what tracks would be included on this CD! WHERE IS STARLINER? That was on the Paper Money album released in 1974...over a quarter of a century old yet it still sends chills down my spine. There are definitely tracks of lesser value that could have been omited; especially M for Machine (gag). Merry-Go-Round is also missing, and that too takes much away from the appeal of this collection. Montrose is one of my favorites, but I'm glad to already have all his albums and not be at the mercy of whoever put this collection together."
1,Investigation of Road Traffic Fatalities?,"Bad! This book contains 23 pages generally describing the duties of the medical examiner/coroner and law enforcement. It then has 87 pages of show and tell photos illustrating either wrecks or fatal injuries. I expected this to be of some use to a traffic investigator, reconstructionist or at least, a private investigator. This book is of no use to anyone who has worked more than one week in any of these fields."
1,Total piece of trash,"Like some of the other reviewers, I should have read these before I bought it. An utter piece of trash. Pieces don't fit together well, cheaply made, diagrams and instructions are misleading. After a few hours we got it together, got it to light up, but the engine wouldn't run.After taking apart to diagnose, we concluded it was garbage and tossed it as such. I'd certainly avoid anything from the Smithsonian in the future."
1,Should have listened to the reviews! Don't buy it!,Bought this for my 8 year old son for Christmas. He loves jets and engines and I thought it would be perfect. It ended up being awful. Not even my 41 year old master degree'd husband could get it together! Obviously cheaply made and not all the pieces fit where they were supposed to fit so the engine couldn't turn. It was very dissapointing and IS BEING RETURNED even though that is a hassle. DO NOT BUY IT.
2,"Disappointing construction, poor customer parts support","I purchased this last Christmas and thought it would be a great educational toy. Sadly, the quality of the parts is pretty shoddy, and due to poor fit, one part in particular relegated this entire set to being inoperable. A wire spring slides along a plastic fitting for the throttle power control...that plastic backstop is actually two pieces mated together and there is a seam that keeps the springs from moving along it cleanly. Customer service sent me a replacement part, but it too was ill-fitted. I rigged a fix of my own to get it to work, but this made the entire thing terribly frustrating. Nonetheless, the engine itself spins and is a good physical illustration if kids are patient enough to learn about it without the base being attached.Overall, poor service, poor construction and it dampered the overall enjoyment of what SHOULD be a fine toy."
1,Poor Quality,"Toy is cheaply made and probably will not work. The first one I received I put together and the motor would get very hot and not turn. I sent it back and when I put the second one together, the motor would also not work. I work in an jet engine factory and basically bought it for a neat toy to have on my desk. If you just want to look at it, its a fine purchase however tf you want it to work, dont buy."
2,Jetworks,We were very disappointed to discover that no less than three pieces were missing from this Smithsonian Jetworks kit. Without one critical piece we were unable to complete the jet engine. Consequently we can't comment on the finished article.
4,Great educational Model,"The engine is great for teaching the small ones (and not very small ones as well) how Jet Engines work. The variable resistor and the thing that simulate the thrust, temp, etc is of poor quality and as an engineer working on the aircraft engine industry I would like the toy to work closer to reality. What I mean is I would expect to detect some airflow at the exit and a red LED simuliting the combustion chamber.Generally speaking, the toy is great a learning resource and believe me, it is not easy to find a model of a Jet Engine in the market."
3,A very helpful read!,"This book is great for anyone who wants to increase sales revenues. It has a LOT of good, practical info on how to unleash the power that salespeople have. It hits all the key points we have concerns about and gives me options for my entire marketing group and sales force. I recommend this book because it's exciting to see a new approach to overcoming the difficulties of selling. A great resource."
5,Virtuoso speaks with brilliant clarity and practical detail,"I've read all the top, 'usual suspect' sales books. Before reading CustomerCentric Selling, I was most impressed with Mastering the Complex Sale, by Jeff Thull. Mr. Thull has summarized current sales challenges in a very compelling and distinctive way. However Mike Bosworth demonstrates that he is the true thought-leader, the virtuoso in this field, and is most generous in providing a wealth of practical how to detail that isn't the case in Mr Thull's book.I work with a multi-billion dollar revenue vendor serving the bio-tech industry. I will be taking immediate action to bring Mr. Bosworth's CustomerCentric Selling organization in to assist with our sales & marketing processes."
5,Outstanding Audio Book,"I did a lot of research on various books on selling before I finally picked up the audio copy. I was very impressed with the content and delivery: understand and show customer that your solution helps the customer achieve their goal, solves their problem, or staisfy their need.The audio reader, Chris Ryan, makes the book much fun to listen to. He is the best audiobook reader that I have listened to.I would recommend the CD (audio) edition of the book. I guess the hardcopy would be useful too along with the audio version."
4,Outstanding guide to Warsaw,"There's a lot to do and see in Warsaw, and this book does a great job of informing visitors about this wonderful city. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it needs a bigger map (or at least more maps showing outlying areas). The maps included in the book are great, but it would be nice to get a bigger picture of the city because not everything is centrally located. I took this book with me everywhere I went in Warsaw and it was an immense help when it came to finding important sites and identifying ones I came across while walking around. And as always, the photos in this DK publication are outstanding. This is the only travel guide you need if you're going to be visiting Warsaw, though it would be a good idea to find a full-sized map once you get there."
4,WARSAW,"Warsaw is a fast developing city and this edition is a bit outdatet now. Otherwise, very good guide-book, just as every other Eyewitness Travel Guide I've used."
4,A Very Good Guide Book!,"This book is filled with photographs of the places described, which piques my interest. The information is detailed, yet not boring. The quality of the writing is excellent as is the photographic quality. My only complaint about all of my Eyewitness Travel Guides is their weight which is because of the reproduction quality used for the images. I do I will continue to use them as my basic guide (along with Rick Steves' guides)."
2,Not what I expected,"I wanted to sync my iPod as quickly as possible, and the documentation (printed and online) suggested that firewire would be faster than USB or USB2.0. But I've synced several times each way, and at least this PCMCIA firewire cardbus is *slower* than USB2.0.Plus, the iPod battery is recharged during a USB/USB2.0 sync, but *not* during a firewire sync. So not only does the firewire sync take longer just for the music, and not only is additional time (and a connection) required to recharge the battery, but the battery also drains *during* the firewire sync, making it a triply long process.I'm returning this, and going back to USB."
3,Be sure you know what you really need...,"While this item probably works perfectly, be sure to determine what sort of pinset you need before you order.I ordered two of these for my sons laptops, and it turns out that they have a smaller pinset INSIDE the computer, despite the fact that the opening on the outside is the same size as this item.It works in my older laptop, but not in their new ones.I probably could have returned them, but felt that the cost of return shipping would be too high to make returning them worthwhile.Live and learn! :)"
2,Didn't work for me...,"A friend of mine swears by this product ... she says she's not experienced night sweats in months.. sadly, it didn't work for me. Probably because our hormonal situation is different."
2,Evidentally NOT for me!,"Evidentally this cream was not for me. I had gotten off my estrogen replacement pill and opted for the more natural cream. Evidentally, I do not need estrogen replacement. Shortly after using, I had the worst head-ache and anxiety. This was the worst I have felt in a long time. I di not reuse cream for a week just in case it was something other than the cream. I tried it again about a week later and got same results. I'm sure this cream is great if you need it, but it was not for me. Another negative was it did leak alot in package it was delivered in-big mess. To be fair, the cream did go on smooth."
3,Works ok.,I'm on my second bottle and it works ok. I had to up the applications to 3x per day so I may try another product (pill) because I do not want the hassle of having to apply this that many times to get relief.
2,Is this the new youth?,"Well, I got this item before I expected and that's nice. As to the product itself I've been using it for several weeks and I don't feel a thing....!! Maybe it's too soon... anyway let's give the product a little more time...and I'll give a new review then, because I know with hormones you gotta be patient. By the way how much time it's enough time?"
1,Not same ingredients in what listed here,"I am very disappointed and don't know how to act upon this issue - This item came and the name was the same, but the ingredients on the product were different than what was listed on Amazon. I am a highly allergic person and need to be careful of ingredients. I would not have purchased this had I known it would come and have different things in it. NOT FAIR - don't feel like having to return it and also lose my shipping I'm sure...guess I'll have to. Haven't tried it either as I am leary of some of the ingredients and my allergies."
5,Sitting on Intex,"So ordered one of these just to try it out first, after reading the rave reviews!We have an Intex above ground pool and thought it might be nice, when the kids aren't splashing around, to just relax on a warm Saturday afternoon (don't forget the sunscreen). It does what we bought it for. Now I just need to get one for the wife to lounge with!The cup holder is also beneficial, a plus for the inclusion alone!Durability, can't complain, still holding up strong!"
5,GREAT float for the money!!,I typically do not buy cheaper plastic floats as they usually pop! This float is strong and actually really comfortable! GREAT job Intex!
4,Durable Lounge Recliner,This Floating Recliner Lounge is really durable and lasted 3 times a long as some of the others I have purchased for the pool. My kids really tested this and it made it through the summer. This is a good Floating Recliner.
4,fun in the sun,Came in handy out in Africa water would buy again. If you want to relax and enoy the water/ sun then you will love having something like this to do it.
5,Great Floaty,We bought 2 of these for relaxing at the lake and are very happy. They are made of thick plastic and are shaped perfectly for just laying back and relaxing on the water. They keep your entire body out of the water however so don't buy these if you prefer being slightly submerged while sitting. The cup holders are a super nice feature too.We couldn't be happier with these chairs.
3,Nice raft for the price... but ripped easier than expected,"For the online price the raft was nice. Large, nice looking, and sat above the water. However the blue part where the arms are ripped after 2 months of use. I saw it happen, and would say the person who was on it can be held partley responsible, but I thought the material would have been a little tougher. Ripped right where the cup holder meets the vinyl material."
2,"nothing I would buy again, too big and bulky for what I was looking to buy.","nothing I would buy again, too big and bulky for what I was looking to buy.It will be good ( since I've already bought it) for my pups, good sturdy plastic, deflates for winter storage....but hard to get in and off on....what a workout this is!"
2,Arm Rest Is a BIG Problem,Only gave it a two because it was very nice for about a month of use. After that the arm rest seal leaked then completely gave way would not recommend this product to anyone.
3,Intex floating recliner,"This float is a very comfy. It keeps you high and dry. The only bad thing was after 1 month of use, the float got a hole in the seam between the seat and arm. There was no patching it because of the area and it's a main stress point (There was a patch kit that came with it). Needless to say, all we have is the u-shaped arms left. I thought about buying another one, and then when I read reviews that it may be the chlorine breaking it down,I decided to wait."
5,Great,"These were the perfect choice for a very comfortable and seemingly durable pool loungers. I am 6'4"" tall and I fit just fine unlike most I try. Well designed!"
3,Big float,"Purchased this float at the start of the season. It is a nice BIG float, you can actually lay on this float and stay out of the water completely! Now, some days I suppose that would be OK, but for me, when I'm in the pool I prefer to be IN the pool- which is why I give 3 stars, others may actually want that. As far as durability, 2 months into the season the arm parts tore a hole in them and I had to cut the blue part off. It's not a total loss though, the rest of the float is still sort of usable. (and a note on durability, any float around here is put through some significant rigor with the kids and all. I think they were using this as a makeshift waterslide when it tore)."
2,Broke in weeks.......NO WARRANTY,"Great float. It looks durable but we have not had it long. You can actually float without getting wet. We have had every size of swimmer on it and all have found it comfortable. I am just hoping it lasts! Did NOT last. Broke in 4 weeks. Arms seperated from float. When I called the company all they could say was SORRY, no warranty. Not worth the money."
4,Good Purchase,"Bought this for a family trip to the lake. Everyone wanted to use it. Very comfortable and seemed durable. Had several ""heavier"" people using it and it held up ok. Only used it once but so far so good."
5,Great floats,"Bought and have actually used two of these recliners (working on season two). For the $$, nothing else compares."
1,Had fun for 2 days,For the price this is actually not a bad bargain the size of it is quite adequate if this product was durable unfortunate for me is was not. I used it for one weekend in my pool and it bust for no apparent reason on the bottom which means there was no way to fix it
1,Bad,It deflates all the time and i have to keep pumping it all the time i should have just got a regular foam one or some other kind. I am really not satisfied with this product and I cost a lot of money too. it was a bad choice of buying two as well.
1,Do not waste your $ on this item,I ordered this float for my Aunt & Uncle. It was the best selling float on Amazon at the time. It didn't even last two days before the outer arm rest portion of the float deflated. We have had $7 Target floats last for years.....I'm sticking to that store for my future purchases.
5,Super comfy,"I've always used my pool for r&r rather than exercise, so I consider myself a pool float/raft expert. This is extremely comfortable, more so than the other lounges I've bought, and I like the thick material they use. It should definitely last a while."
5,Very comfortable but BIG,"Like others I do not know why this is reviewed as a toy. It is definitely not a toy. I had no idea how large this float was until it was in my pool! It sits on top of the water so can be rather sticky on a hot, humid day. I just keep pouring water behind me and that helps. I love it for later in the afternoon or early evening when it is a little cooler and I just want to relax. It is so stable that I have no issue with using my Kindle or talking on my cell phone when using it which is nice. I've only had it a week, so I can't really comment on durability. My major issue is how large it is because I cannot leave it in my pool because my cover won't fit on top of it so it has to be dried out and put in the spare bedroom between uses. All in all, it does what I purchased it for."
5,Very comfy!,"At last a comfy way to float and read. This float is amazingly comfortable and seems to be very durable despite being inflatable. It's reasonably priced, contours to your body, and keeps you well above the water. We were so pleased with it on arrival that we immediately ordered another."
1,Not worth the money,"I have a reclining float that I bought at Wal-Mart for [...]. It is just as good, if not better than this one. This one is difficult to get on and to stay on. The one we received was different from the picture... I may send it back in fact. Not a good value."
3,Toy?,"When I bought this it was for a sun chair not a toy? it's to ""BIG"" get it if you have a huge in ground pool only!"
5,Great Product,"This float is better than ones I have previously paid much more for. You stay dry so you can use it to read or listen to your MP3 player while you float around the pool. I am so glad I bought it and will definitely get another to have a spare and for when my sister-in-law comes to visit! It is very tough, surprisingly comfortable and stays inflated."
4,Great for staying out of the water,Got one of these and the wife absolutely loves it. She can float on top of the water and sun with a drink and not get wet. Well at least until one of the kids decides it's cannon ball time!It is a great floater when early evening when it starts to cool and you don't want to actually 'be' in the water.
4,Good buy overall,"Overall I like this product. It keeps my 200lbs floating just above the water and has two cup holders, perfect for that pool day beverage. The rubber that it's made out of does raise some concern with me as it seems a little thin. The seams are sealed together and make a ridge that is a little bit scratchy on the skin. Also the two piece design of the raft leads me to think that the blue arm rest section could separate from the white high back chair. Don't try to lay on your stomach unless you're trying to crack your back, as the arch in the chair leads you to be in a sitting position only. It is comfortable to sit on but I bought one of those cupped mats to lay on. So overall I would buy this for the purpose of sitting comfortably on your pool and enjoying a beverage. (Homebrew for me please) Cheers"
4,Floating along,This is a very durable raft. We rented a cottage by the shore for a week and used the floating chair several times with people of different shapes and sizes(some really big dudes)and had to put very little air back in once it was inflated. And the drink holders worked well also. I would definitely buy another one.
3,SHADES OF GREY,I got this as a gift and they already had it. I returned it. Therefore I cannot give a review on same.
5,Quick Classic Quilts (For the Love of Quilting),"Excellent older book featuring several traditional quilt patterns. Author writes clear directions and quilts are suitable for beginners, but some are challenging enough for more experienced quilters. I have a number of Marsha's books and have not been disappointed in any of them. Definitely a good value!"
5,Keep going back for a quick review of techniques,"I judge a quilting book by how often I refer to it after the initial glow of reading something new. This book I keep close by to refer to the techniques for borders, bindings, hanging sleeves, quick piecing and rotary cutting. Classic Quilts arranges traditional quilt patterns from easy to more difficult. I am a beginning quilter and I particularly liked the Accuracy Test exercise on Page 14 so that I could see how accurate my cutting and sewing was before I began a big project. I discovered that my cutting was a little bit slim and my seams were a little bit wide. The companion book I would recommend for more varied projects and in-depth details is The Quilting Bible by Singer."
4,Classic quilts in all sizes,"I own this book and refer to it often. I think its strengths are: thorough instructions for making several classic quilt patterns, good photographs of the finished quilts, and charts outlining yardage and construction of each quilt in several sizes (lap, twin, queen, etc). It isn't the most imaginative book but I think most people would find at least one quilt in it they would like to make."
4,Great ideas and easy instructions,"I used this book to make the Storm at Sea quilt within as a wedding present for my cousin and his fiancee. It turned out wonderful, beautiful, beyond my expectations. It was my first full-sized quilt ... had made runners, lap quilts, etc before. The instructions and illustrations were easy to follow ... but the quilt definitely was not ""quick"" ... it took me 8 months of weekends. I know it's because I was relatively new to it, though. (...)"
1,Not Exactly Pleased,"I am hesitant to give a bad review of this book, but as a beginning quilter, I was totally confused by some of her techniques on rotary cutting. I think she gave a great explanation of hand quilting and machine quilting, but the actual block construction techniques were not explained thoroughly. This may be due to my beginning status, but I really did not like this book."
3,informational,"I heard a song by the rock band Grizzly and this is the Grizzly Bluegrass group. Decent bluegrass but not what I was looking for.Grizzly areGina Black - bass & vocalsKirk Rundstrom - guitar, mandolin & vocalsMike West - banjo mandolin & vocalsJeff Burke - mandolin, guitar, banjo & vocalsPeter Holsapple - acordion & piano"
3,It's okay,"There are a lot of interesting facts and tidbits and lots of technical terms for everyday actions. Overall, I found it a bit boring and hard to look forward to. But I aced the class."
4,human side of organizations,"This book came just in time for my class, very inspiring The book is a fall back on future references."
5,Success and tragedy always seem to go together...,"Lots of books about stars are trashy, tabloid material. Not so with this book. This book has a story to tell and it's filled with real-life members of a dysfunctional family and their joys and tragedies. I personally love Marvin Gaye's music, but if even if you aren't a fan, there's enough history of music, the music business, and African-American life history from that time period to make this a great book. Lots of detail, but not too much. A real focus on the individuals in Marvin's life who ultimately shaped his life and the events in it--Highly recommend this one. Really well done (and the pictures are interesting too!)"
1,"As always, you get what you pay for","Much lower quality than pictured. It looks like a cheap cut-out. I didn't expect much for $11, but this is borderline false advertising."
4,Worthwhile Reading,"Lack of motivation in a bright child can be heartbreaking for the child and the parents. I bought this book to help me understand my grandson and his current lack of motivation. It has been extremely beneficial in not only giving me possible explanations for his attitude but in allowing me to realize this is a rather common problem. Dr. Rathvon offers reasonable and sensible suggestions for working with the issues at home and guidelines for seeking outside help if needed. After highlighting half the book, I sent it to my son in hopes that it will give him encouragement and guidance. I would highly recommend this book to anyone seeking to help a child who is unmotivated."
1,Parents should avoid this book.,"This book, based on Freudian theories, is not for the average parent. The author blames parents for all of the problelms their children may be having in school. She completely ignores the realities of external social forces, including poverty, community culture and the existance of BAD teachers. Unless a parent has the advantage of having read other theoretical works, they might accept this bunch of parent blaming junk."
2,"Lots of psychobabble, but maybe it gets better??","I'm halfway through this book and it's making me feel very sad and guilty. I thought I was a very good parent through my son's infancy and toddlerhood, but the author says my poor parenting skills are to blame for his lack of motivation in elementary school. Indeed, she makes this one point ad nauseum throughout the first half of the book. I'm hoping she stops blaming me soon and gets to the solutions..."
2,Not enough focus on the successful part,"I agree with the reviewer (K.H.L) who commented on putting the blame on us as parents, but I do see areas where I did contribute to my daughter's lack of motivation. I found this book very disappointing because almost all of the focus is on wrong ways to motivate. Several examples are used for each wrong way, and only one example given for success. This book is less about helping your student become successful, and more about what you are doing wrong."
3,Not as good as it should be...,"While this is a useful accessory, I would suggest looking for another. This case only holds 3 DS games and 2 Gameboy Advance games, they could have doubled the capacity by simply adding more netted game holders, there is definitely room in the case for that. However, there isn't room for an AC Adapter or an extra battery, so this case really can't be used for long trips.Overall, a good start, but there's got to be something better out there."
1,This Game Is THE WORST GAME EVER,"I have a Windows Vista Home Basic laptop, and there are some serious problems with the graphics. The vet walks very strangely, the game freezes up while she is doing certain things, the music is annoying, squeaky, and repetative, the camera controls are absolutely bogus, and worst of all- I can't even see the mouse! If you see this for free, don't get it even then- it messed up my computer, and now I keep getting The Blue Screen Of Death and I had to uninstall it. It was seriously disappointing. Of all the games I have (and I do have quite a few), this was the worst one ever. It is sickeningly easy, you only check over the animal for a few seconds before the diagnosis is grossly obvious, and you don't even treat the animal! I used my allowance on this and if you have any sense at all- DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!"
2,Worst Game Since Hopscotch,"Okay, so I bought this game about two years ago. I tried it out, and hated it. The graphics were horrible, the vet glitched all the time, and the surgeries and operations weren't life-like. The graphics were supposed to be 3D and didn't even look like 3D. The tasks were boring and fun wasn't even a had-been. I totally did not like this game, and will never play it again in my life. Very boring game. Nothing ever happens. Playing with the animals in the enclousures and cages is boring. The surgeries are boring and so is walking around the property all day wondering what to do next. Don't buy this game, you will be greatly disapointed."
2,Dachshund Doesn't Dash,"This was a present for a grandson living in an apartment where animals are not allowed, but who is always wanting a dog. The big disappointment was the extremely short life of the battery."
2,Not Great,"This toy looks realistic and looked fun on line, however- 1 month after receiveing it - the mechanics for the ""breathing"" sound started makeing a lot of noise to point we turned it off and never use it...too bad as that was part of the charm of the product. Maybe overpriced for what it does or does not do."
1,Lacks respect for children's intelligence,"I bought this dvd for my educational enrichment course on the gold rush and after previewing it, feel I cannot use it. I love informational shows that present information in a lively and fun way (such as Reading Rainbow) but this one flashes unrelated goofiness constantly in a misguided and disrespectful effort to sink down to their perceived level of children. Why on earth would one think that flashing scenes of the 49'ers football team playing would show a link to the nickname ""49'ers"" used for the gold miners of 1849? This kind of pointless humor is used throughout, to the extent that it is hard to glean much useful information from the film. I'm deeply disappointed. Come on Jones --give us some real history without demeaning yourself and your audience!"
1,Bad Service.,"I've previously written a bad review about DVDStore because I ordered the film Anarchists Cookbook on April 3rd. Almost a month later I still had not received the film, yet i was [....] short in my bank account. I was really counting on receiving the movie for a research paper for school. I wrote a pretty bad review speaking of the unreliability of the DVDStore. Soon after my review an associate of the DVDstore and promised me reimbursement for the film and two free movies to make up for the mistake and all I had to do is take down my bad review. Well, I took down my review and this representative of DVDStore stopped e-mailing me and it's been a week and I have yet to be reimbursed and he is no longer replying to my e-mails. To avoid further complications like this I will probably not go through DVDStore and I will not take down my review until I am given back the money I've wasted."
1,Avoid,"Do not purchase this DVD, unless you like to be stuck watching the same previews over and over and over again. The studio apparently blocked the ability to fast-forward past the previews. Don't pay them money to make you watch commercials. If you must watch it, borrow it from a friend or rent it (cheaply)"
1,What a waste,"It is SO small and only hold about 6 inches of water. My two year old son was in it and was WAY too big to have fun in there. We used it for about 5 minutes and he was over it, and I threw it away. It's cheaply made and a complete waste. One of the worst purchases I have ever made."
2,Just doesn't MIX...,"The songs on this CD sound like someone picked out a Church Choir Church Program and added some electronics to them. The first song ""Rise Up"" should not even be on the CD. It is more like a ballad and the CD just goes down all the way to the end. I buy Dance compilations to work out and dance to, this one actually hindered my work out. I was very disapointed. Even great Dance Divas like Loletta Holloway, Jennifer Holliday and Hannah Jones don't help. You can tell what type of music the CD is by these 3 artist...Gospel Dance. Holloway's remake of ""And I Am Telling You..."" is an embarassment to Holliday, but Holliday's contribution ""Think It Over"" should have been passed over. I did not even recognize Hannah Jones. Oh well, better luck next time."
1,Expensive and not quite useful,"I decided to buy this pan after successfully using a deeper copper pot from Falk. Currently I'm not usig the frying pan because anything and everything sticks to it, and it's really annoying to scrub it. Moreover, it destroys the food, for example if I just want to fry eggs. I don't understand why similar products would behave so differently. In any case, I do recommend the Falk brand (directly from their site). In the Falk pot the food never sticks to the pot."
3,"good pan, less than great design","It is funny to see comments about how beautiful this pan is. This item has the function of being used when cooking - I could care less about design as I am not spending my weekends in the kitchen admiring my new acquisition.What I care for however is functionality and item's health related features.Regarding functionality: at this weight, the handle is kind of thin making it even more difficult to use this pan. The handle should be somewhat wider to allow for a better grasp.Other than this comment (for this price), we bought this pan to avoid any ""non-stick"" coatings and aluminum of any kind. And it performs as intended."
5,excellent review book,This book is an excellent review book that covers every topic to be prepared for the exam. This book summarizes most of the topics and then includes some questions related to the topic. this is a very good book that prepares the students for the ACSM exam.
5,Great,"I received my book brand New. It was affordable, it came on time, and it was in Great condition. Thank you Amazon!"
3,Serviceable but .................,Fan runs very slowly on the lower speeds.Not a perfect solution but a kinda solution.Wish I could find a genuine Hunter replacement part.
3,quite bored...i prefer stories of bad boys....,"i have read all the bad boys published by Brava and enjoy a lot of their stories. This book is not as good as them...maybe we prefer bad boys more than heros...hahaha.But Lori Foster is still the one of the best romance writers, she has a good sense of humor...and also i recommand Shannon Mckenna...she is new but she is really good...cannot wait to see her new book!"
3,"Not great, not awful...","I bought this book for a vacation where I didn't feel like carrying multiple volumes with me. Because it's three stories in one, it seemed like a good idea. And it wasn't atrocious... But I do feel like I may have lost a few brain cells while getting through all the sap. Take this collection for what it is, a beach read that is not meant to be analyzed or thought of in any realistic way and then you'll be fine."
4,Practical Guide to What You Thought You Already Know,"This is not for the faint of heart or the prurient. Bruce is not a cover model, so don't get this looking for GQ men.This DVD is an introduction and practical guide to incorporating mindfulness and sexuality into one's spirituality. Using these techniques and ways of thinking about autoeroticism can alter your meditative practice as well as your sexual life. Over time wonderful things can happen both in your mind and in your bed."
4,very nice on the eyes,"when we recvd it we didn't know it came in a lot of pieces. paint to put together. It is also said to be made by Sauder. So far so good. would have rather had someone else put together, looks like it will hold up great"
5,Delicious!,This DVD is awesome! Watching Lorraine make these wonderful foods in her own kitchen reminds me of my own mom in her kitchen. The recipes are delicious and easy to make. I highly recommend the spinach pies!
3,raybestos disc brake rotor review,"I ordered a pair of Raybestos disc brake rotors recently from Amazon.com. I received them quickly and they were shipped free of charge, which was very beneficial since they are very heavy. They were shipped and packaged nicely. They seemed perfect in every way--except one--one of the rotors had a ""ding"" imperfection about 3/8"" long right in the braking surface. In my opinion, probably not serious enough to require me to return it--but noticeable enough to make me disappointed with the extra money spent to buy the name brand Raybestos, which I also discovered manufactured these in China, not in the U.S. or Canada as in the past. My new opinion is to take a chance and buy reduced price ""other brands"" since they too are made in China anyway."
5,LOVE IT!,"I HAVE ALWAYS ENJOYED THE BRAND NEW HEAVIES, NOW TO HAVE ALL THE SONGS I LOVE ALL TOGETHER IS WONDERFUL. I AM REALLY PLEASED WITH THIS CD AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT IF YOU'D LIKE A MIX OF FUNKY,JAZZY, WITH A LITTLE HIP HOP-ISH TWIST IN YOUR LIFE...THEY ARE TRUELY A GREAT BAND!"
3,A Trunk Full Of Funk,"I didn't really know what to expect from this C.D. I had known of the Brand New Heavies for years. They're a band local to me (Ealing), and one which is consistently played on the dancefloor, but of you had asked me to name some of their hits, I would only have been able to come up with 'You've Got A Friend'. Having listened to this a few times, I can only say that I can still only name one of their hits (which features Seidah Garrett on vocals), but I am nevertheless better informed. There's nothing outstanding here, except perhaps the band's performances. They have proved themselves adept at picking vocalists and consolidated their talent over the years by shrewd choices of musicians and producers. However what they really need is a strong songwriter, once they get that right, all their songs will be as memorable as their hit."
1,Once again,This is my second attempt at writing a review on this card. Let's just say that after getting a piece that actually recognized in my system (all very high end components) that I was NOT impressed with the speed compared to others I have tried. Good luck.
1,Did not work well at all,"I bought this card and returned it in a matter of hours. It is very slow on any read operation, and I had several problems trying to write to the card using a reader that worked well on every other CF card I own. Save yourself trouble and get a Sandisk."
1,awkward...,"you are sooooo freakin weird ""raven"". Is that your real name or do ou just want it to be that? well anyways, the doll would be so freakin ugly if it had a gold tooth. why the hell would someone want to wwear a gold tooth????????????????????????? I mean, that is the stupidist thing I have heard since you said that they need a parrot. All of your ideas are stupid and noone is probally going to agree woth you. your such a freak.../zoe/"
1,Shut up my scene losers!!!!!,"Just shut up, you two. Bratz are a LOT better than my sceneand you know that. So be QUIET!! Bratz rule and my scene should get sacked. P. S. This Cloe doll is majorly ugly. Why does everyone think she's so great????"
2,Wierd Cloe...My favortie Bratz character..the beauty...turned in to wierd,"I think this Cloe is not so beautiful.I liked Roxxi better in 100000%times.There are many better Cloe dolls than this one.I dont think she is soooo cute.But hey.Dont beat my review,because I still love Bratz,but I dont think that this doll is so beautiful.That`s my opinion.SARA SIBLINI!!!MY SCENE LOVER!!!BRATZ LOVER!!!*FOREVER*"
4,I really enjoyed trying Gas-X. I'd never used ...,"I really enjoyed trying Gas-X. I'd never used this type of product before, but it worked great for both my husband and me. We had less bloating and didn't feel as miserable as we sometimes do after meals. Since I'd never tried this type of product before, I can't compare it to other brands. But I've been really impressed with Gas-X."
5,This was the first time I'd ever tried ...,This was the first time I'd ever tried this kind of product and it indeed works as it claims. Very effective. I'd definitely recommend Gas-X to friends and family.
2,Appeals to Junior High tastes,"Burning is really just simmering. Get a life, guys. Putting signal words in the titles sells music (?) to little kids, so these guys will keep going."
5,Enjoy!,"Erik Balkey is one of those artists that I just haveto sit down to listen to - this isn't something thatyou just throw on while you're doing the housework orsorting through the bills.With a combination of a fabulous voice, sweet guitar work, intimate writing and true soul, Erik grabs your heart and makes you feel. And that is rare. So this music is somethingyou should sit down and give your whole attention to...and really you have no choice - the minute this CD starts playing you'll find your at Erik's wonderful, tender mercy. Enjoy!Patty Keough"
4,Kenny does it again with one misstep!,"Hey there!Just wanted to say Kenny has produced another fabulous album! Every song is excellent with one exception. ""He Will, She Knows"", also his 1st single is horrible!!! I have no idea why someone so smart chose that song as a single! Any other song on the CD would have fit much better! Oh well=) I still give it an A!!!!"
3,Really Not a fan,"I can't say that I bought this album for myself... Im young and never listened to Kenny, but if you have an older loved one in your life, get it for them, its probably going to be the last album that Kenny ever makes so here is your last shot to get something for the Kenny fan in your life."
2,Daza,"I was pretty disappointed with this game. Apart from the fact the the graphics were pretty lame, the AI was poor and the game play was very much the same from level to level. I should have know there was a reason the game was so cheap. I wanted it to be at least passable but just as it was getting to that stage. The game was over, trust me this is a very short game. Please do not waste your money."
4,very good interview preparation,"I would highly recommend this book for job interviewing preparation. Also recommended for job interview preparation are the job interview guides published by Vault.com, including the Vault Guide to the Case Interview and the Vault Guide to Finance Interviews. Good luck!"
2,"Well written, but...","An entire book of ONLY interview questions is just too much of a good thing, IMHO. There are several books which have a chapter on interview questions, and list only the ones which are you really likely to encounter, which I have found much more useful."
2,"Standard, uncreative answers","This book explains how to cover up bad points about yourself, and how do deal with personal or illegal questions, but certainly gives very few good answers to help win a job. There are plenty of better interview books out there."
5,Excellent resourse,"This is a great book and the information in it will allow you to really impress even the most seasoned interviewer. This book covers the most frequently asked and hard to answer questions. This book also covers in detail what interviews are looking for when they asked certain questions and how to formulate sharp, concise answers."
2,With whom has he been interviewing?,"I did not count, but it did not seem as though I read 201 answers, but fewer. In many years of working and interviewing, more lately than formerly, I encountered perhaps 3 of the questions. In today's market, it seems interviewers are looking for evidence of directly applicable and detailed skills, especially technical and hard ones, for comfort with the candidate, for evidence of being quick, adapting well, and for initiative and solid achievement. The questions are mildly contrived, and I have not been asked more than about 3 at any time in my longish career. Possibly because he covers so many which are illegal or too personally probing in this litigous era."
5,manicure pens with nail file,I had a chance to use this product and it was great. I have even more beautiful nails. I file my nails then polish them. The writing pen would be great for me to use in school. I would recommend this product to my friends.
5,Great pictures!,"The pictures of the 392nd BG are a good supplement to those posted in the 392nd BG web site, at www.b24.net.The paintings of the aircraft are excellent and true to real pictures we have. Our father 1Lt Gordon Lee Hammond, Jr. piloted El Lobo and Short Snorter in the 392nd BG, 579th Squadron. A picture of Bronco Nagurski, 579th Squadron, however, is missing. Great job!"
5,The best,"Time and again, aviation books fail to deliver - poor text, poor photographs (often due to poor paper quality) or derivative material.This book by Mike Bailey is a striking exception. For this reviewer, a lot of the photographs were 'new'. This is indeed an album, relying more on the visual than the textual. Nevertheless, it contains exceptionally detailed captions.For B-24 addicts, this is the best book since Steve Birdsall's 1968 ouevre and comprehensively improves on that now dated work.Several pages of fine, accurate coloured drawings, most in profile, complement the offering.This book informs and engages the reader. Highly recommended."
3,Wasn't exactly what I was expecting,"I bought this book, sight unseen to expose my son to French. That being said, I didn't really know what it was about. Turns out, it's a book about, um, poop. At first it was sort of gross to read, but I've gotten used to it, and my son finds it amusing."
5,Serious about sales? This is a MUST have!,"Stinnett did what many other authors tried to do but failed. You will find yourself applying the techniques in this book, and seeing positive results, immediately. Think Like Your Customer helped my struggling reps reinforce structure in our sales process and build qualified pipelines. At the same time, it helped the reps to focus, strategize, and sell at a new level ... and now they are making more money than me!!Message to my friends - Guess what you're getting for Christmas!Message to my competitors - Keep reading Maxim!Message to Mr. Stinnett - Raise your price, this book deserves it!"
5,"I am just blown away at the thoroughness, quality of process and thought that has gone into this book","I am always looking for what I think is the best sales book to recommend. This is the book for B2B sales this year. A very high sales performer, Bill Stinnett has really hit the mark with this book. If you coupled the strategies and methods of Stinnett with the strategies and tactics used by Bill Freese, (Question Based Selling) you could build the ultimate sales machine in your company. I am just blown away at the thoroughness, quality of process and thought that has gone into this book. When I asked Bill for a review copy he arranged to call me to find out where I was coming from and what I did with the reviews. This gentleman dots the i's and crosses the t's.Buy it, read it, and keep it on your read often, do not lend bookshelf. Of course if you are content with the status quo, this book will only make you realize how much more there is out there. I am really pumped by Stinnett!"
3,It Will do,Acronis true image worked ok for me but its a shame i had to purchase incd seperatly to be able to burn to dvds. But at least it does work. I did try norton ghost before but had no joy as when i tried to restore it didnt work.My advise is if you want to create a backup of a harddrive/partision to another harddrive/partision or cd/rw-cd(that is better than nothin!) then buy this software BUT do remember ya will need nero incd to burn to dvd.Note if you are going to use cd's remember a backup image is BIG! buy lots of cd's!
3,Not an easy program to use,"I've owned and used computers for 20 years so I don't consider myself a novice yet this program is not easy to use. Yes, you MUST have cd/dvd burning software if you wish to burn images to these media and this is not made obvious. Parts of the interface and the manual are also not easy to use and I have spent many hours reading the manual and thinking about the interface in order to get it to work. Also, there are error messages that give you no info about what has gone wrong so you have to go to the manual and study to try to find out. If you are going to use DVDs to burn to I had also to find in the back of the manual under troubleshooting that I had to be sure I was using the right type DVD for the burning software being used. I finally got it to work but I hope version 9.0 is improved."
5,The Sawtooth Wolves,This book is awesome!! I have sponsored the pack for nine years now and never get tired of looking at the book. The photography is exceptional and for anyone who loves these majestic wolves they have to buy the book!!
1,HMMMMMMM?,"I am condeming the amazon review. It states that wolves have a culture that closely resembles that of humans. YAH, RIGHT! Good Lord! They are animals not people. They don't write books,or plan for a wedding. They don't debate philosophy or politics. They don't wear clothing or study history. I was going to purchase the book until i read the ridiculous review. Now i will have to review it first via the library etc.... I have many books on wolves and have actually owned two shepard - wolf hybreds."
4,Sizing kinda stinks,I love love love the shirt and the material its made of is super soft nut it runs pretty small. If it had given more info about the sizing I would've ordered one size up.
3,maged from Saudia Arabia,"I bought 4 pieces, two pieces were installedAnd one worked with me for two days only(Burned), replacing it with anotherFairly good experience"
2,Burns Bright but Short!,Ordered and shipped without issue.My problem with the product is a failure after about a week of use. Both wires of the filament in the bulb have sheared from the glass base... Clearly a manufacturing defect.
2,...i'm sad...,"...because I really looked forward to new happiness with a new brand. But unfortunately, I bought this thing for eggs (scrambled as well as over-easy) and they stick. (Disclaimer: yes I followed the instructions--low heat, not in the dishwasher, etc etc.) I'm about to return it and order a Calphalon, which I know cause I've had two already (they last about two years). But I am kind of sad, cause this pan looks really neat and feels great to hold. Well, I'll get over it."
1,Bad. Pan,This is a very poor surface to cooks eggs on . Under all temps the eggs stick . Even when the pan is buttered or oiled it is impossible to nt have the eggs stick . I have never owned any pan whose surfaced was so inadequate . Buy another product.
4,Hallmark Doesn't Live Here Anymore,"If your idea of love is limited to visions of puppies and balloons, The Thing About Love Is... probably not for you. In Polyphony Press' first effort, the heavy topic of love is tackled in gritty, gutsy pieces that cut to core of this complex emotion. Sometimes it's bliss, sometimes it's bizarre, and quite often it hurts, but regardless of its form, love is always intriguing. This anthology is in keeping with that notion. With a variety of styles and voices, the works featured here are unanimous in their ability to draw the reader in and keep him hooked. It is truly a great read that may challenge one's personal definition of love. Call it an enjoyable experiment in mind expansion!"
3,"It was ok, FOR A RETARDED","I agreed with Cassie/Pink but I agree strongly to Chibilute, I mean look at it, it's the same enemies (except for Ivan Ooze) but the special effects were okay, (compared to Turbo:A Power Ranger movie) but it was poor on plot and sense, why the hell will an Ooze man want to enslave parents? and Zordon said about old mystical Rangers, what happened to them? they retaried? or what? if I was the creator of the Power Rangers saga, I'll make a prequel, just like Star Wars."
3,Gift for friend's son,I can't really give this item a 5 because all I did was purchase and pass it on. The case was in like new condition and as far as I know the boy who received it loves it.
2,Wheres The Region 1 Release,"after all it first aired in the US, so why aren't we getting the season box sets after almost 20 years now"
4,Reminded me of watching it as a kid!,"If you grew up on watching the original power rangers, this is a good way to take a trip down memory lane and relive the fun. This movie shows the original power rangers turn into the ninja rangers. As long as you keep in mind that this movie was aimed for us as kids, you won't be disappointed! May be fun to intoduce to a new generation of ranger watchers."
4,the power rangers movie is #1 in all pr movies,"The Power Rangers Movie was awesome. It had a shakey plot, mostly from the history stuff, but the scenery was wonderful! Places like the Youth Center, Phaedos, the jump site from skydiving, and the construction site were very very amazing and realistic. The action was always at the maximum, the romance was great, the music was very good and very fitting to the scenes. IT IS A TERIFFIC MOVIE! BUY IT! ITS ONE OF THE BEST PR MOVIES EVER!"
5,Mighty Morphin Power Ranger... The Movie,"This' my son's Favorite movie, an aunt had previously given him this movie on VHS; all day, every day he watches this movie back-to-back, over & over again. So I bought this DVD, knowing that sooner or later the VHS would probably break with the wear & tear he's putting on it. To date I've probably seen this movie over 50 times with my son... a 3 year old & his movie, what can you say! :)"
5,Hilarious.,"Okay, as far as bad movies go, this one is so freaking hilarious. I couldn't stop laughing the first time I watched it. Its a classic Power Ranger movie and fun to watch in big groups!"
4,Only one thing to say about this movie: It's nothing but fun,"I saw this movie in the theater way back in 1995, and it kept me on the edge of my seat. The effects were a HUMUNGOUS imrprovement and helps the story along nicely. It had good writing, especially for the deliciously over the top Freeman. I must admit though, that some of the jokes were kinda corny, and that the movie itself was more dramatic than the show. Me being 15, I still watch this movie from time to time, because It's just a plain fun, feel-good action/fantasy flick. I think that the next movie should go back to the original rangers instead of these new wanna-bes. I still love this movie!!!"
4,Pretty Good,"Even if the movie is filled with horrible lines, being stated much by the rangers, this film's special effects are incredible, as are Paul Freeman and the girl in the green bikini. The pig is hilarious, and all in all, the movie is pretty darn good."
2,Suitable for children.,"Lacking any intelligent dialogue or acting, this once-popular Fox Kids show made into a motion picture is substancially better the TV series, with OK special effects and some suitable comic relief. The plot is lacking any suspense and has barely enough interest to pique the interest of adults (the Rangers are played by young adults, considering the roles they play). The Power Rangers are played with lightheartedness, the roles not taken very seriously. But the plot, special effects, excellent costuming, and comic relief keep this from flopping as a remake of 1993-1995's popular childrens' show. Passable family viewing, considering its PG rating."
3,"Okay, but not as impressive as the TV show.","A Power Rangers aficionado I appear to be, but this movie wherein they have to stop Paul Freeman from a toxic invasion is a little too drafty, except for the end sequence. I'd rather just stick with the once popular TV show."
5,Gotta see this one...,"It didn't do well in the box office simply because it had the words ""Power Rangers"" in it. The show is better than what people like to think, IMHO. Despite the splicing mistakes, the effects, look, acting, and script were great. It DID look like a movie and not a TV show. Whether you're a kid, an adult, or in high school, I reccomend this movie."
3,Power Rangers the movie,That is my favorite. I was the kid young. I am obsessed this movie. Because I want ordered it for this from Amazon. That is all!
2,bad quality,"I'm a big fan of the original power rangers....even liked them when they got rid of trini,zack, and jason. So I decided to purchase the movie...but the quality of the dvd was really poor. It kept fading in and out...the volume kept changing on it....not a good purchase"
3,Ok...,"The product was in new condition, just arrived a little late, for ground shipping it took almost 2 weeks to get here..plus the tracking information provided by Amazon, was kind of lagging..I normally had better service with Amazon because I buy everything here..."
5,great condition,It was delivered fast and no tears or scratches on the DVD which was great. The price wasn't bad either so I recommand to buy from this person.
4,Power Rangers - The Movie,"I purchased this movie for my grandson's 3rd birthday. He loves it and wants to watch it all the time. He imitates the kung fu moves, which is better than a lot of the violence you see in movies, even ones geared for the younger crowd.The humor is hokey, but considering the target audience it is fine. There is enough goo, special effects and colorful costumes to please a young group, boys and girls.I watched it myself 4 times in one rainy afternoon with my grandson, Nathan, and it was ok. He loves it and that's what counts. Four stars."
3,Best of the PR,This is by far the best power ranger movie out there and the best of it's long running series. However the price isn't worth it. You can go to your local wal-mart and pick this up in the 5.50 bin (that's where I got mine) without the shipping and handling... plus it's there right then and now.
5,"Silent, Somber, Seductive....","In other words, all those twilight moods that Herrmann was so wonderful at evoking.And Mr. McNeely and his fine orchestra give every mysterious, melancholic bar the loving care and attention they deserve.These cues and themes were composed during Herrmann's finest period, and like Psycho they share that strange, hypnotic quality of an ethereal and slightly unsettling chamber music.So, in keeping with that ambiance and hall sound, splendidly recorded. The selections on Disk 2 alone are worth the cost of the set"
5,the single life ain't for me,This book had me laughing and cheering Nicolette Montana on. My book club just read it. I'm married and thankfully I don't have all the pressures on me like single people. This book gets two thumbs up.
3,You tell one lie you have to tell many others...,"Sheila teaches you that one lie will always lead to another, which is what My Invisible Husband is about. Bryan and Nikki got drama because Nikki's got nothing but lies. It suprised me because it was actually pretty funny. I wasn't expecting that at all. On the flipside it had me saying YEA RIGHT in some places. Some of the stuff wasn't too believable. I can't really say it's a page turner, but it's one you can finish."
4,Would Make A Good Comedy Movie!,"This book was funny, fast-paced, and it was also true to human nature and how society can make both single men and women feel when they are not married and childless. Some people will go through desperate measures to ""fit in"" even if it means living a lie. The title of this book was very deceptive in itself. A reader could have easily assumed other possibilities as to what this book could have been about, so the title itself was a good marketing strategy of Sheila's.Like the other commentaries, I look forward to reading other books by this author."
1,Bad Memory .... Go with another brand,"I bought this card because of a low price for 64 megs. I have two digital cameras, and this card is only recognized by one. The images write to the card very slowly, and even deleting all images from the card takes a very long time. I have a Memorex USB CompactFlash drive for my computer and it works great with my Viking and Lexar CF cards, but does not recognize that its own brand of Memorex CF is even in the drive! I recomend Viking or Lexar, as both have yet to disapoint me like this Memorex card has."
5,so much fun,My kids are having a blast with this carousel. The seats swing out when turned fast. One of the funnest Playmobils that we own. I would highly recommend it.
3,Beautiful Ideas - Full of Mistakes,"A beautifully photographed book of afgans for beginning to advanced knitters. How discouraging can it be to start a project, and realize things just don't ""add up"". If you are a knitter, you know what I mean.I contacted the publisher and pointed out a number of errors in their directions. Surprisingly, they sent me two pages of Editorial corrections, most of them identified by readers.All I can say is, BEWARE, and call the publisher and ask for the Editorial corrections OR you try to figure out if there is a mistake in the directions. Just have fun!!"
3,"Beautiful patterns, needs better editor","I love this book. The patterns are beautiful and easy to follow, the pictures are stunning, and I expect to get a lot of use out of it in the coming years.However, I'm working on my first afghan from the book, and there are two mistakes in the pattern. It's on page 52, and the pattern doesn't work unless you cast on 154 stitches instead of 152, and there's a psso missing from Row 11 - without it, the row is a disaster of increasing stitches that would probably result in a giant triangle. I'm about 80 rows into the afghan, which had to be restarted three times in order to work out these typos, but now is coming along beautifully. But it makes me wonder what other typos are in store for me on the other pages."
1,"Errors, errors, errors","When I set out to make the Lavender Mist afghan from this book I soon realized that the pattern didn't make sense. When I contacted the publisher, they gave me three computer files with errata for this pattern - and almost every other pattern in the book. The Lavender Mist pattern had errata on EVERY line - including the number of stitches to cast on. I'm not convinced that even with the corrections they have come up with the pattern envisioned by the designer as it requires a 30 stitch repeat!Really, we should expect better proof-reading than this from our publishers. I am not likely to use the book again because I don't trust the patterns. It isn't worth the money I spent on it."
1,Imaginative Speculation Plus Computer Games,"Dawkins is a master of imaginative storytelling. He also resorts to computer simulation to ostensibly show how living structures could arise from less complex parts. However, his computer-made structures bear only a superficial resemblance, at best, to actual living things, and are orders of magnitude less complex than even the simplest of living things. Conclusion: Molecules-to-man evolution remains, at best, unproven."
5,Now I want to work in this field,"This book made me realize that genetics and biology in general are really interesting fields, where beautiful theories are born, and immediately confronted with observations. Dawkins is extremely clear without being condescending."
2,Climbing Mount Improbable,"Like most of Dawkins' books, this one just rambles on and on. It's like sitting through a long and boring lecture. He makes his point and then goes over it again and again until you start wondering why you started it in the first place. I love his thoughts and ideas, but reading his text books is a real chore."
4,Fantasy?,Who ever thinks Johannes Keppler was an empirical scientist obviously is not familiar with his work. In any case scientists today are divided into theoretical and experimental and both have contributed to the advancement of science. Empirical is just another word for experimental and maybe only applies to an earlier generation of scientists like Faraday who did not have a theoretical framework to work with.
3,A bit of a disappointment,"After having read the Blind Watchmaker with enthusiasm, this book was a disappointment to me. There were few new ideas, best I could tell.Maybe this is different for a creationist, but for someone like me, who is convinced that Darwinism is correct (in the sense, that -say- Quantum theory or the Theory of Relativity are correct) this book offers very little over the great Blind Watchmaker."
1,Classic unproven assumptions,"So many unproven assumptions and wild speculations, along with a misuse of ""possible,"" which can only be used correctly if non-zero probability has been demonstrated using known science. Book should be titled ""Sliding Down the Slippery Slope of Mount Impossible."""
5,Another great book from Dawkins,"I don't know why I had it in for this guy I really don't. Ah well, now I've climbed down from my position on the summit of Mount Impossible or Mount Theism as it is known, I won't have to give bad reviews to the good Prof anymore.Dawkins demonstrates clearly that step by step evolution can account for the complex structures we see around us today. After at first denying it (using Behe) and then hijacking it (using Ward) I've come to realise that it is self-contradictory to adhere to a belief system that rails against the very mechanism that gave us an appreciation for intrinsic value, awareness and the capacity to love and which I claimed could only have been designed by God. I mean, if God designed it, who am I to then say but it's evil and must be combatted ? This does not make sense.So I won't try and claim that anymore as it's silly. I look forward to Dawkins' next book.andrew_baker99@hotmail.com"
3,Once more with feeling,"Dawkins has done it again, that is, written a book on neo-Darwinism with great style and conviction, if little humor.The trouble is, with the exception of a new analogy - the evolved organism that emerges atop Mount Improbable after a series of unpredicatable adaptations - he has said almost all of it before. I liked his descriptions very much of vulture flight and other awe-inspiring natural adaptations, but they were the only items that were truly new to me. Indeed, his Mount Improbable analogy is not as good as the traditional depiction of the tree of life. Better to stick to his earlier classics."
5,Works great,These scope bases are worth the $$$ and I would recomend them for your air gun! They fit right and raise the scope over the sights.
5,Great Scope Brackets,They work very well on the Benjamin 392 air rifle and the HB22 air pistol. You can still us the factory sights with these dovetail brackets installed.
4,Loose fitting,I have an older .177 Benjamin (pump)pellet rifle and these clamps were quite loose on the barrel. I found a bit of rubber from an inner tube and cut a small patch to place around the barrel so the clamps would tighten up. Worked well. Searched the web for other clamps but found none so this may be the only choice for older models.
1,WILL NOT TIGHTEN,"THESE MOUNTS WILL NOT TIGHTEN ENOUTH TO KEEP THE SCOPE FROM MOVING. I USED A SHIM AROUND THE BARREL, BUT WHEN I MOUNTED THE SCOPE ON WITH THE SCOPE RINGS IT LET THE MOUNT MOVE UP AND DOWN THE BARREL.THIS IS A BAD DESIGN BECAUSE THE CLAMPS WORK AGAINST EACH OTHER."
1,One of them is on there now.,Mounts slide up and down barrel. I removed them. Iron sights work very well. I later used vise grips to pinch one mount on the barrel while I screwed it down tight. Screw's head broke off. Both sides of the mount are threaded. They will never tighten. I now sight through the orphan mount with the broken screw. Product is crap. I returned scope.
5,Fit perfect,Purchased for my benjamin 392 air rifle. Took about 3 minutes to install and worked perfectly. Doesn't get any easier to install. Scope mounted great on mounts. These are the mounts for the 392.
2,Imperfect - could have been a lot better,"The tag on these mounts state that they're for ""all Benjamin and Sheridan pistols and rifles"", and yet they fit my Benjamin 22 pellet gun so loosely that they slide back and forth, not to mention tick side to side. If I tighten them any more, the screw will bend or break, and I'll be worse off; to make this work, I'll need to fashion some spacers to put between the barrel and the mounts, taking care to choose a material that won't expand or change shape.Also, I took them to Sportsman's Warehouse, the store with the biggest gun supply, and they didn't have any way of mounting rings on top of these mounts in order to attach my scope. I'm going to have to special order those too.Putting a scope on a Benjamin rifle has turned out to be a huge chore, and these mounts missed two opportunities to make it easier, by (1) not fitting the gun snugly, and (2) providing a less usual ""receiver groove""."
2,Scope mount,Was the only scope mount I could find to fit my Sheridan. The mount was poorly machined and the screws were totally worthless. Had to buy new screws and ream the holes in the mounts.
5,Dandy Mount,"Used it to mount a scope on my Sheridan/Crossman, works fine so I'm happy. Haven't had any problems with it."
3,Needs work to be functional,"I bought this intermount for my recently purchased Benjamin 392 as it was a little less than half the price of the Air Venturi intermount. As is, they do not grip onto the barrel tight and will move around. I had some strips of rubber that I was able to cut to size to fill the gap so they would not move. With this set up, they work well, though it may not be the most robust set-up. You'll definitely have to watch how you set down and store your gun. I attached a BSA 30mm Red Dot Sight to the intermount and was able to get satisfactory groups after sighting in."
2,"Love Claire Burke, But Disappointed on the Warmer","I was so excited to find that there was a warmer for Claire Burke! I first found these wonderfully scented products in Solvang, California back in the mid '70s, so that tells you I've been a fan for a long time. However, this product simply doesn't disseminate the fragrance like I expected. I have it set to the double switch and very little fragrance (spice) can be noticed in the small bedroom I decided to try it out in. So, I'm crushed. I did order ""Oh Christmas Tree"" and have great hopes that this will perform better. Maybe the spice oil isn't so great, it is a first time for me. So, I will remain cautiously optimistic. But for now, I'm sad."
2,Not for me,"This seems to be a fine, sturdy cupholder but unfortunately it is not designed for the Jazzy 600. I hope to figure out some way to attach it to the chair but so far no luck."
3,not the best idea,I found it to be very flimsy especially for the price. It is the only one I could find for my electric chair so I will have to use it but carefully!
1,cheaply made,will not work on my elec. wheel chair very cheaply made I sent it back I would not recamend it
3,Not 100% compatible,"I got this remote and contrary to the description, it would not work with my garage door. Thank good ness for Amazon's return policy. I give it 3 stars based on construction alone."
2,A very dull read,"Marketing managers keen to improve sales should steer well clear of this tedious volume. The book consists of a long trudge through business-to-business marketing theory and then a section of ""mini-cases"" designed somehow to amplify the points made in the first part.The author is an academic, and his sympathies appear to lie with the North European IMP movement. But it's not at all clear what practical advice this group has to offer the business world (besides banalities such as customer relationships are important).Without mentioning him, this book provides ample evidence for the fact that Kotler dominates practical marketing theory. Until the IMP group cuts the jargon and starts to address the needs of the practising marketing executive, then it, and books like this, can safely be ignored."
5,"If you liked ""Pearl Harbor"" ,you will love this book.","With our renewed patriotism post 9/11/01, Thunderbolt:Out of the Blue captures the honor, sacrifice, family,love and heroism that defined our country's ""Greatest Generation"". This book is not just another a World War II story. Robert J. Steele and Richard Steele weave a pattern of intrigue, emotion and triumph fundamental to the fabric that makes our country what it is. This true story would make an outstanding movie. I highly encourage anyone and everyone to read it. You won't be dissappointed."
1,let's see who can get drunk the fastest,"It's ""what I did on my vacation"", stuff. Written by a remarkably self-serving,horny, 20s something guy, well on his way to alcoholism."
1,Get real.,"If you don't want what you pay for, buy this one. It's almost as though they want to make a video without really doing anything. If I'm going to spend money, I want more than teasing."
4,Nicely Told Tale,"John Lightfoot has a knack for telling his story in such a way that you can almost feel yourself there with him as he gets sucked into the underworld of drugs while trying to do the right thing. His vivid descriptions of the adventure and travails put you there right with him as he walks a tight rope of drug runner and undercover agent. You can almost feel the sweat running down your back, soaking your shirt, while the knot in your stomach tightens. Quite a story and a very enjoyable read!!!"
3,A quick read. Mr. Lightfoot presents his story very well,Mr. Lightfoot writes very well. The book reads in a very fluent manner. The book takes an unexpected turn in the storyline.
5,What a great movie!,I thoroughly enjoyed this film! Wonderful story with some great characters. Great selection of actors (including some familiar faces). I'll never look at car salesman the same way!I recommend this to everyone!
2,St.Phillips Boys Choir?,"If you are thinking of buying this cd as being by The St.Phillips Boys Choir who are now known as Libera, You will be dissapointed, as upon receipt the cd turns out to be a school choir in Cambridge of the same name. It is a nice little novelty cd but not early Libera I think. If you know better please add to this fact file. IJM"
5,Loved it,Has all the info as the newest one! Don't pay double for something with just new pictures. I saved a lot of money!
3,"Great Product, Bad Manufacturer Service","Okay, so here's the lowdown on this thing. It works well with just about any device that requires these cards, no problems there. Can take all 128MB and not break a sweat. Originally, there was a rebate offered with this product. I know two other people who bought this exact same product, sent it in, and didn't get jack for it. Don't buy if you think you're going to get some of that money back. Anyways, overall a great product. Enjoy it!"
2,"Great Music, Lousy Mastering","This album is chock full of some classic music. A good selection overall that represents a fine cross section of the bands talents and evolutuion. Unfortunately, as any ELP fan can verify, the recordings leave a great deal to be desired. I find it odd that the best sound on the entire compilation is one of the live examples near the bottom of the track list. ""C'est La Vie"" is recorded live, but somehow outshines all of the studio material as far as Clarity, Depth of Image, Ambiance and Frequency Response. Almost all of the studio tracks sound flat and very scewed toward the high end. I am a fan from way back but have always been dissappointed with ELP's recordings and purchased this compilation hoping for some noticeable improvements from the mastering engineers at Rhino. Needless to say, I am not impressed."
3,Decent but lacking,"There are some very good songs on this compilation. Focusing on ELP's progressive rock sensibilities, a lot of classic moments in early electronica and electronic rock are showcased. But can an album be considered a collection of the Very Best of ELP without what are perhaps the groups most well-known tracks, Hoedown and Nutrocker? The album provides a decent sampling of the groups range, but this leaves it promoting some work that is more the exception than the rule of ELP music."
1,Emerson lake and palmer,My copy was skipping and couldnt be returned because I opened it. Won't order again. I don't know how you are supposed to find this stuff out unless you play the CD first. Return instructions read that it could only be returned in original unopened container. I will stick to ordering from B&N.
3,"Tense and harsh, but that's war","I read this book at school and found it funny in parts, but it did show the harsh reality of war. The ending happened too quickly and it didn't explain what happened to half of the characters. The title refers to the fact that in war all kinds of people pull togerther to fight for their country. It was a bit racist towards Japanese ( but these were who they were fighting ) , Scots and Welsh but it was only light hearted fun by one of the characters who was the humour of the play, and people from these countries will want to see what happens in the end END"
1,In parts it it too graphic and there is not much of a story-,the book is not one that I would reccomend because the whole thing is just too slow the story made all of the oficers childish especially Bamforth.
4,Justin Hayward & Friends,"I must say that ALL the songs sung by Justin are EXCELLENT. So teh four satrs go all to him! However, the other people who are singing on teh CD are terrible. Buy the CD for Justin. Rumor has it that Justin himself has NEVER gotten paid for this CD. But it is OK."
4,"Nice, heavy duty pan","This pan is nice & heavy duty, but food sometimes does stick to it. The trick is to pre-heat pan on medium heat and cook food on medium heat ONLY. It heats evenly and cooks quickly once it's hot. Stuck food washes out easily. The inside does not chip or peel. I would recommend this pan...so much healthier than teflon!!! I use it to cook everything!"
5,Mauviel copper jam pan,It's beautiful to look at and easy to clean between batches of jam. This was a whole new level of preserve making for me and the end product was wonderful!
1,Did not survive,"Received on time. I planted them in containers, because we were still having frost warnings. Three of them totally died...one is left, but barely hanging on. I've learned my lesson, will buy my plants from local nursery from now on."
2,Wouldn't do it this way again,"The shipping was quick and the plants were packed securely, but within a week the plants were dead. I don't think they were allowed to root long enough before they were shipped. My bad--I got too busy and did not call the company to see if they would replace them. I also ordered two other plants and only one made it from the pair. I just don't think ordering plants through the mail is such I good idea. I have ordered other gardening products from this company and had absolutely no problem. Shipping was always quick."
1,The Z Man????????????,"Horrible beyond belief. They call the Zodiac Killer the ""Z Man."" My son said that the Zodiac Killer would probably come back and kill the people who created the film just because of that, not to mention how bad the movie is.We couldn't even watch past the first murder. I could do better with my digital camera and my son peeking through doorways.This movie deserves to be on a list of the worst horror films of all time. -10 stars."
1,Too bad the Zodiac's last victim was not the director,"I rented this thinking it was ""Zodiac"" with Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo, and Robert Downey Jr. It was not. And this is about the most difficult to watch movie - told from the perspective of the killer. If you insist on renting this movie I suggest you drink a a fifth of scotch and watch it while doing a headstand. Then...maybe...the movie might make sense.So bad you'll be cheering the murderer."
1,Sucked,The WORST movie ever made. Thank God I just rented and did not buy it. It Doesn't even deserve 1 star.
1,Zodiac Killer Review,"Terrible. Awful. Has nothing to do in any way, shape, or form with the actual case. I could not sit through the first 10 min. of this waste of time and film-making. Besides the content being incredibly bad, the actual footage itself looked as if it were shot by the same type of people who film porn movies."
1,Very Bad!!!!,"I saw this movie and decided to do housework while I was watching it. About 1/2 way through it, I became bored with the movie and just did housework. I am sorry, but this movie is just plain awful. The only reason I started to watch this movie is because it said it was by the director of ""Boogeyman"". Yes, I was one of those few people that liked the ""Boogeyman"". I try not to rate movies this low when I watch them, but this one deserves a ""0"". Watch ""The Zodiac"" instead. It is much better and informative than this piece of trash."
1,ED WOOD LIVES!,"This is what you get when the director, actor, and screen play writer are all the same: bad directing, bad acting, and bad writing. The film interjects past films, coupled with the bad acting etc. reminds me a little of an Ed Wood formula for saving money. There was nothing good about this movie except for the end."
1,I ACTED in the movie...,"... and I didn't even get paid for it... despite the director's (ulli) promises. So - maybe that's a measure of how bad a production it was...? But I thought I'd get this out to the public - just let people know what sort of production and director this is... I played the computer hacker. (it was fun to do, though! - and I'm not even an actor!)"
1,wtf,this movie is so incredibly bad that i almost think it's supposed to be some kind of joke. it's so ridiculous that i don't even know where to begin. just don't see it.
3,Worry 101,"This is a good overview of the various forms of worry and the generally recommended treatments. I don't think it will reduce your worries on its own, but I do think it will help point you in the direction of help. I found the book ""Choose to be Happy"" more useful in identifying the positive steps I could take to reframe my perspective on my life."
2,Food for thought: pills,"Don't expect a real exploration of anxiety - psychoanalytic, psychotherapeutic or otherwise. This is light stuff. Hallowell offers behavioural tips, anecdotal evidence, and some names of drugs that seem to work well with some patients. Hallowell is a psychiatrist and a lecturer at Harvard. In this book he promotes a lot of shortcuts - but not much deep thinking about an engrossing subject."
4,Very Interesting,I am very impressed with this book so far. I have not gotten very far but I am intrigued by this book so far.
4,"Dee lundgren, licensed professional counselor, Bucks County, PA","This is a helpful book on a topic that everyone has to deal with, worry. It is a great self help book to that can be used as a supplement to professional therapy if worry has gotten out of control. It is written in an easy to understand and apply format. Good insights and research to back up what is said. I've read another book by this same author and he is one of my favorites."
2,Don't look to this book to help you stop worrying,"Hallowell's book does a good job of classifying different types of worries/worriers, but a very poor job of helping you worry less if you already know you worry too much. If you suspect you waste too much time on worry and you want to figure out how to help yourself, this is definitely not the book to buy. I'll save you the cost of the book: (1) get professional help (especially Prozac); (2) eat healthy, cut out the drugs and alcohol, and get some exercise; and (3) stop worrying so much (if I knew how to do that, I wouldn't have bought the book). There's nothing wrong or inaccurate in his advice, it's just not helpful. All I can see this book doing for you is that it may (but only may) enable you to walk into a psychiatrist's office with a more technically accurate self-diagnosis (how much help that would be, I won't speculate)."
3,not for beginners,"I ordered this with high hopes to learn some japanese, but this book is just too difficult. It may be good if you already know at least some rudimentary japanese, but not for beginners. I recommend going to the bookstore instead for buying books like these. you'll get a better idea of what you're buying."
1,Doesn't shed much light,"This book gives virtually no driving directions or driving times - an email query to the publisher was not acknowledged. It claims that the only way to fly in is to Albuquerque - in fact, United flies to Santa Fe, as I discovered while boarding my plane to Albuquerque - giving me an extra hour's drive coming and going. The maps are inadequate at best - few of the attractions/lodgings mentioned are shown. Hotel listings are incomplete, and biased toward the high end. Admission fees to attractions - often as high as $10/person - are not given. Many sights are mentioned (Anasazi cliff dwellings, Mesa Verde) without a description, but are not in the index. No chart of annual temperatures was given - that I could see - I found out the hard way that it gets very, very cold in the winter. In short, using this book to plan and travel was an extremely frustrating experience."
4,Great Info for out of the way places,"If you want temperatures, driving distances, and accommodation prices get the free books from AAA. If you want great information about out of the way, interesting places you'll probably miss otherwise, buy this book. I have all the ""Hidden"" books and always use them when planning a trip. I find them especially useful when I want to go an alternate route to places I've traveled before. If you want to plan a trip using the ""Blue Highways"" use this book-if you want to get there fast and miss a lot of interesting things, fly...then buy the book anyway to see what you've missed."
1,Misses the point entirely,"This biography is an odd mix of dispassionate relating of facts together with old-hat Freudian speculations about sexual matters and supposed ""insights"" from the likes of Susan Sontag and Thomas Mann. Not only is the book not insightful, it entirely misses the point. I had not previously read anything about St. Therese, and I came away from this wondering what all the fuss about her could possibly be. I'll try the autobiography next, which is probably where I should have started."
5,Story of a Woman,"Kathryn Harrison's biography of Therese Martin is a brilliant work from a variety of perspectives. It is meticulously researched based on pertinent historical documentation. The writing is poetic, and the narrative style is consummately exquisite. But of particular value are the keen insights that weave Therese's psychology into a spirituality rich in the human values of pain, loss, and ultimate transformation. Many know the saint, but few know the woman. Kathryn Harrison knows the woman, and perhaps the few will become more numerous as a result of this gem of a book."
1,No thanks.,"Just what we wanted: Kathryn Harrison's criticism and psychoanalysis of St. Therese. A disappointing handling of a saint who is loved by millions. As usual, when it comes to Catholicism, anything goes."
4,Clifford pop up book,"My 3.5 year old granddaughter always picks this book and another Clifford pop up book to read when she is at my house---and, yes, I do have other books to choose from but these are her preference."
3,Is it time to change the way the One Show is judged?,"The One Show has long been an ego boost for judges. In years past they made smart, well-reasoned decisions. Over the past decade, in my view, judges egos has overtaken their decision making as they reward formulaic thinking, recycled ideas and below-average production values. This said the One Show remains among the world's best collections of advertising and design."
2,Palm Tungsten case,Wasn't quite as expected--supposedly meant to fit Tungsten T2 and E2 but I found it a trifle over-sized for my Palm device which rattled around a bit. It would be better for a thicker PDA or smartphone like a Treo I think.
2,cubic zirconia studs,very pretty but ya better be very careful in handling them becuz the ones i bought did not have the crystal mounted very well. i just handled them very gently trying to get them in my ears but the cubic zirconia crystal popped right out. they are not expensive but should still be stronger
1,Terrible!!,"The CD opens with ""Twinkle, Twinkle. Little Star"" - Now, that should tell you everything. . . YUK!This compilation is a huge let down and has nothing to do with pregnancy or childbirth. I could have put my own tape together better from my own CD collection instead of wasting my money on this lousy one."
3,I wished I liked it but I did not.,"I really wanted to like PRECIPICE, but no matter how hard I tried I just did not like it. Most of the characters are not whom or what they claim to be and we know that the protagonist is portraying someone she is not. All it did was confuse me more and more and made it hard for me to enjoy it.The only other book written by Savage that I have read is VALENTINE. That novel really kept me guessing and I enjoyed it from beginning to end. (I, however, am not interested in seeing the `movie'). I have SCAVENGER in my pile of books to read and hopefully I will like that one better."
3,This was okay.,"I was really excited to order this book because the plot line sounded so interesting. I must say that although the basis of the story was pretty good, the book never quite made a point. The book seemed very superficial, I could never quite ""feel"" any of the characters (even the lead character, Jane). I don't really know what could have made it better (since I don't pretend to be a writer). But it just felt like something was missing.If it was a book I borrowed from someone I wouldn't have minded, as it wasn't terrible, but I wouldn't recommend putting out good money on this book. If your life is busy and you don't have alot of time to read, I would recommend spending your reading time on a better book."
3,"Started out great, then I burst into tears . . .","I enjoyed the first third or so of this book--in fact, I found the premise to be intriguing, and for several hours I couldn't put it down. But as I read further, I became frustrated with Jane, who seemed weak and unstable, prone to ""bursting into tears"" at the tiniest provocation. I also thought the book was awkwardly written, although that may be because it was translated from French--at least I think it was. I found the character of Lynn to be stereotypical, and after I while I just didn't care who wrote the manuscript Jane was reading. I did finish the book, however, so I gave it three stars--if a book is really bad, I figure life is too short and put it aside. But this one I finished, so it did hold my attention to some extent."
2,Pretty cheap,"This product appears to have the strength to do the job as I was able to pull my dock up the lake bank about 15 feet like I needed, but it has two major annoyances. One there is a cheap little metal guide for the wire that bent pretty much immediately. The second and most annoying problem is when you want to pull the cable back out you need three hands. One to pull, two to hold the gear open, and the third to keep freeing a different medal guide whose corner continually catches the wire when pulling it out. I would not buy this again even at this cheap price.Update 7/6: on the 2nd use this product broke under stress. I was trying to pull some metal rebar out of the ground and little 150lb me pulled so hard the bolt holding the cable spindle bent. I would not recommend this product at all. Toolprice offered a refund but I am guessing the cost to ship it back will negate much of my refund."
1,Garbage,Broke the first use trying to pull a stump was using speedy chain couplers rated at 3200# and the entire cable spool collapsed before anything else broke totally worthless way overrated.
1,real junk poor quality,The broke first use under very little pressure it bound got stuck and the whole body twisted and jammed and we could not retract it. The load was less 1 ton. I am not sure what application this would be suitable for as the electric winch on my 4 wheeler did not break a sweat.
1,Don't buy it,"Why does someone buy a ""heavy-duty"" 5-ton come-a-long? In my case it was to use it. The first time I used this product to pull a cut and snagged tree down it broke. Really not much more needs to be said. My feeling is that you should not be able to break this product by pulling on the handle to ratchet it up by hand. It should just stop before you could break it. Nothing extraordinary was going on. If you plan to actually USE this and expect a heavy duty product you will not be happy."
3,Good for occasional use,"I purchased this item to replace a section of chain link fence but I did not want to spend a lot because this was a one time use. I have used professional Come-a-longs so the short comings of this one were very evident. Most notable is the fact that there is no quick release. After you have tension on it you have to slowly release the tension in the reverse order that you applied it until there is almost no tension left. However if you need something that you will use infrequently and don't want to worry about having to go out and rent one if you need it, then this is not a bad value."
