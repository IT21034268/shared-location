3,Not for extreme chewers.,"I'm sure I have one of those dogs that can chew up anything. and I mean anything. But I got a recycled fire hose and it lasted awhile. He did eventually chew it up. So I thought this would be a good durable toy. It lasted 5 minutes. No joke. As soon as I gave it to him, he had a hole in it, and the strap chewed off in about 30 seconds. The rest was completely destroyed in literally 5 minutes. I'm sure it was made ok, but didnt hold up to my extreme chewer."
1,Pass this one up - get a Kong,"My puppy had this destroyed in under 10 minutes. Not durable or long-lasting at all. Usually Kyjen brand toys are good, but not this one. Waste of money for us, tossed in the garbage the first day. If you have a aggressive chewer, spend the money on a Kong."
1,Very disappointed!,"I can not believe how many dog toy manufacturers get away with calling their products durable! Every bit of advertising for this product is directed toward how tough it is. In fact it is not at all, my Boxer had both ends chewed off and the stuffing pulled out in less than 30 minutes. I know toys aren't indestructible, but if I am going to spend this kind of money on a dog toy I expect it to last considerably longer than the ones priced much less. In short, do not waste your money if you have a large dog!"
2,Did not last like I thought it would.,"My retriever ate through it during the first 24 hours. She laid down and started chewing one corner until she had a hole and then started dismantling it. All the stuffing was out by the next day! Maybe your dog isn't as crazy but mine likes to ""gut"" her stuffed toys. We still have it minus the stuffing and she loves pulling on it and fetching it!"
3,"Dog Not Very Interested, Relatively Durable","We have a power-chewer, 50lb Black Lab Puppy so need to have toys for him to chew so that he doesn't chew the furniture or other items. This was recommended by another puppy owner but so far, after 1.5 weeks and trying to get him to play with it every day, he is not interested in it. He's chewed off three of the four corners, each corner taking about a minute or so, but otherwise really doesn't care for this. He normally loves to play tug-o-war with his other toys but the scrunchy-like band on this is not so conducive to this; a rope would have been much better."
1,Nothing indestructible about this one!,"I don't know who wrote the other reviews on this toy but it is certainly not hard core nor anywhere close to indestructible. Within minutes, our Goldendoodle had a corner chewed open, stuffing pulled out, and bits of rubber and nylon threads all over the floor. Don't waste your money."
2,Fun tug and retrieve toy but....,"When left alone with my dog, he chewed right through it in a matter of 10 minutes. All that is left if the bungee cord part."
2,Not tough at all.,Despite the description that this toy is tough and can stand up to the chewing; my lab mix had it opened and the stuffing out in record time. He enjoyed it for the 5 minutes it took him to do that but for me it was money poorly spent.
3,Not for smart toy destroyers,I have a 9 month old Weinaraner who chewed the bottom black part of the toy off in about 15 minutes. The red part is strong and hard for him to eat through but he sure trys. We still have it because he likes to carry it and the stuffing is not coming out yet.
3,Good 4 some women,I used the cleanser and moisturizer before purchasing it on Amazon. My face was really dry and breaking out. I live in an apartment complex and the water is hard which is part of the reason my skin was dry. I ran out of the amino genesis and used oil of olay hydration and that worked better than the amino genesis. I could at least see that my skin wasn't dry.I decided to try the product again and it does not work for me. I still have dry skin and I have to use the moisturizer at least two or three times a day on certain areas of my face. I did try washing my face two times a day with this products to see if that would help but it made my skin even drier.I am not bashing the product; I think for certain women would be a great product but I will not waste another $100.
1,Stopped working after two weeks,"It made good rice (though it could be a little wet/gummy at the bottom) and steamed food well, for the two weeks that I had it before the heating element inexplicably stopped working."
1,horrible! spits everywhere!,caution: this is by far the worst rice cooker i've ever used. it spits starchy debris through the steam release hole in the lid AND from all around the edges of the lid. it makes a huge mess.
1,You get what you pay for,"I initially would have given this cooker a better review, but it recently for no reason stopped working (owned 1.5 years). I suspect the heating element broke. It also is very messy and does spew rice water all over the place. I literally would place the rice cooker in the sink while cooking.This was my first rice cooker I owned and for a minimal investment, it did cook rice. My next rice cooker I'd like to have a stainless steel inner pot and better quality that will not suddenly die after a year of use."
2,Cheap product,"I love the concept of this (with the steam basket) and being able to cook an entire meal at once, but this product barely works. I push the button down to cook and the light flickers. I must repeatedly set it until it will cook. I'd advise you to either buy another brand or only buy this from a store so you can return it if it's not working properly."
1,Lousy rice cooker,"I really don't understand why the rice cooker has so many good reviews. After using it for a few months, the non stick surface is badly scratched even though I always used a plastic scoop. Now, I get a thick crust of rice every time ans its just a big waste of rice. I regret not spending more on something better."
1,bad product - don't buy!,I have now owned two of these pathetic rice cookers. Neither has lasted longer than 14 months before the heating element dies & the thing no longer works. Don't buy this! There are much better ones on the market than this.
2,Not built to last,"This cute little rice cooker is well-priced and made tasty rice. . . maybe six or seven times. Even when I rinsed the rice extensively before cooking, it did bubble up and create a mess as some other reviewers have indicated, but the end product was fine. However, after just a couple of months of use, the cooker simply stopped heating. Now I'm in the market for a new rice cooker."
3,Works well but not durable,"I have had this rice cooker for eight months and have been pleased with its performance. It does a good job with everything I've cooked in it, mainly brown basmati rice, wild rice, and steel-cut oats. It does sputter somewhat, so I've never cooked more than 2 cups of dry rice at a time, but I think that's an acceptable limitation given the price. It cleans easily. However, the nonstick coating is now flaking in several places despite the fact that I've always used a wooden spoon and washed the bowl by hand. It may be that I just picked up a defective item. However, since teflon-type materials can pose a health risk, I'm planning to discard this cooker and look for a similar model from a different manufacturer."
2,Messy,"I generally do not like to give poor reviews but in hopes that this might help someone else, here goes....This rice cooker does not have the bells and whistles others do. That was a plus in my book.However, it is very small and if you try to cook the full 3 cups you will find that you have a mess. There is a little hole on the top that is for the steam to come out of and what happens is the liquid comes out of that hole too. It spatters out and the lid gets very dirty. I have to put a small towel under it to make rice because it makes a mess.I have followed the directions and it still makes a mess.I have owned other rice cookers and have never seen one as messy as this one.Once you get the hang of it, and if you over look the mess, this makes a fine pot of rice. It doesn't make too much so you don't have to worry about left overs. It makes enough for my family of 2 adults and 3 children to eat at a meal with a little bit for my husband's lunch."
2,Disappointed.,"I've only tried this a couple of times and I was disappointed. Instead of steaming like I expected it to do, it insteads boils to where it splatters out of the lid and the steamer hole and created a huge mess. Even when cleaning the rice it still boils over to where I have to leave the lid on part way to keep it from doing that. To me that is a burn hazard to anyone who would want to use it or get near it. The machine itself tends to get too hot and the grill the dish sits on gets burn stains on it. The rice takes a long time to cook and when it is it is too overdone and soggy to eat, and sometimes gummy and has that filmy stuff on the bottom of the pan. I was hoping for some nice steamed rice like you'd find in one of those good rice cookers."
4,It works for me!,"This little red cooker is great! I was a little worried by some of the reviews i read, but i found the measuring of rice and water to be a cinch. I would defiantly recommend this product if you love rice, are on budget and don't want to be hassled or bother with messy clean up."
4,Rice cooker,"Great little rice cooker, allows for perfect rice every time. A bit smaller than I'd like, but perfect for 1- 2 people."
4,so far so good,"I was looking for a rice cooker and saw this one on amazon. I actually ended up buying it at Target for approximately the same price. I figured it would be a lot easier to return to a store if I didnt like it. Ive used it twice so far and it seems to work just fine. Its nothing fancy, but at that price, its not supposed to be. It doesnt look like there are flimsy or cheap parts after I inspected it. The only thing I dont like about it is that is comes with its own measuring cup. This cup is its standard of measurement. The problem is, the cup it comes with is not a standard measuring cup in volume, but some seemingly random volume. Perhaps its actually a standard Chinese measurement and they felt it easier not to mess with the numbers when selling it in America. My only concern is losing the cup, which would be inconvinient, but not awful. Well, no matter what, seems to work and even 6 ""cups"" of its own size it still a LOT of rice."
2,Way too small,This rice cooker was much smaller than my previous one and doesn't have much room for steaming. The colander takes up half the space inside when trying to steam vegetables cutting down on the already limited space.
1,Terrible product,"I have a 20 cup rice cooker and I bought one of these at WalMart to cook smaller amounts of brown rice. Epic fail. Left the rice on overnight, about all it did was get soggy. I looked at the unit and it appears there is some sort of spring under the burner to keep it from warming when there is no pot in it. The spring seemed to tight to weigh down to the burner with just two cups of rice."
1,KRAP,"Total piece of s---t. I bought one at Target, it fried after 2 weeks, so I exchanged it for another. The second died after 3 months and i was out of luck unless i wanted to spend the time and $6 to ship off to the manufacturer. KRAP"
3,"Rice Cooker good, customer service horrible","I've owned the 6C Rival Rice cooker for several months. During moving, I lost the measuring cup included with the cooker. This cup is necessary to use the cooker, as they never tell you what the dimensionless numbers (1,2,3) on the cup really mean (oz., gram, cups, etc.) and I never thought to determine that for myself.I wrote the company an email explaining the situation and asking if they had a replacement, offering to pay for it if need be. I was told, simply, that they didn't have one and that they were sorry. I wrote back to ask if they could check with their manufacturer and/or supply house to see if they could find one, again stressing that I wanted to use their product but couldn't without the cup. They replied again with no, and that they were sorry.Now I have a semi-worthless rice cooker (I can still steam things in it) that I only got to use for a couple of months."
2,Not that user friendly..,"I purchased this item as I have a hard time cooking rice to perfection. The reviews led me to believe this was a good choice, and the red matched my kitchen so I sent off for it. Well, when I received it, I don't remember if there were instructions or not - but either way they weren't there or it got lost and there is no way to figure out how to work it otherwise. I even did a web search to try and find how to use it, but to no avail. The only ""use"" it got out of it, was that I have some friends that have toddlers that for some reason beelined to the item to chew on it or throw it around (maybe because of how many parts it has). I ended up giving mine to the local thrift shop as without the manual it's useless."
3,"Taste good, but makes a mess","When the rice cooks, it bubbles the water up and out of the hole on the lid... which then sprays everywhere. I need to look back at other reviews because I think someone had a suggestion on how to fix that. Anyway, the rice taste great, but unless I can figure out how to prevent the spraying mess, I wouldn't buy again."
2,Wanted to like it but it's a real disappointment,"I've tried several different varieties of rice. I've tried adhering to the instructions and I've tried altering them. No matter what I do the rice never comes out right. Its sticky, or its mushy, or its brown, or underdone. I would have given it only one star, but for the price I can't complain too much. I mean, the rice is at least edible, sort of. I really wanted to like this cooker! It's so cute! But honestly, I would recommend spending a little more to avoid disappointment."
2,Cheap,"This little thing makes decent rice. However, it is flawed. First of all, it required a lot of pressure and small fingers to push down or pull up the little cook/warm switch. This creates two other problems. First, it's likely to tip over if you don't use your other hand to hold it down. Second, in my case, the switch assembly broke off after only a few weeks of use. After taking it apart I saw that it's only help there by one screw and two cheap plastic pegs (these are what broke). Also, the markings aren't easy to see when you're trying to get the water filled right. Finally, there is no ""off"" other than unplugging the thing. I think if the thing is on for more than like an hour or two it should automatically shut off to avoid burning your house down. So you get what you pay for. It was inexpensive, but ultimately wasted money because I just have to go buy a better, more expensive rice cooker."
1,A disappointment,"I guess I shouldn't have gone ""cheap"". It broke after about 4-5 moderately successful uses and wouldn't heat again. It always seemed to make Basmati rice rather underdone."
1,Overpriced!,"This rice cooker is AMAZING, but don't buy this overpriced Amazon listing! I bought mine for maybe $12-15 at a Target store six years ago, and it's been beyond perfect. The steaming basket is perfect for a bag of frozen broccoli or peas (or a can of red beans), and my rice (or quinoa) comes out gerat. Yes, sometimes it gets a little golden/crispy on the bottom, but only if I didn't use enough water and/or didn't stir. You should always stir your rice/quinoa/whatever once or twice during cooking. That's true of every rice cooker I've ever used, though. This one is really simple and straightforward, easy to use and clean, and has lasted a long time for me. You can buy it for $15 on Rival's website, and I paid less than that in-store at a Target (years ago, though). Don't pay this much on Amazon."
3,"It's ok, but I was hoping for more.","This product was a bit disappointing. I was really looking forward to using a rice cooker, but it just never seems to come out right with this one. I find it always sticks together in a clump on the bottom and gets that papery stuff stuck to it--not very appetizing. I have tried following the directions exactly and even adding extra water, neither really worked any better. I think I would opt for another model."
4,"great rice cooker, reasonable price","I have had this rice cooker for about a year now. I have used both the steamer and rice cooker functions of it and it works great every time. It's also quite easy to clean. As others have mentioned you do get a little starch out of the venting hole, but I haven't noticed it being a huge problem, and I usually just plug it in next to the sink and turn the hole so that it points that way.I have never had rice come out any way other than perfectly cooked with this rice cooker, and I am terrible at making rice on the stovetop, so it was a perfect purchase for me. :)"
1,Not worth even the low price,"We have used this rice cooker for about the past year to make white and brown rice a few times per week. It was not our first cooker, and replaced one I had previously used for several years. Nothing about this cooker works well. The non-stick coating has become quite scratched, despite using only the plastic paddle included. Rice is unevenly cooked, and always overly browned and stuck to the bottom, making a large portion of the rice cooked inedible. This is particularly a problem with brown rice. Water sprays out of the hole in the lid, dirtying the counter (and anything we've mistakenly left nearby). Save your money and cook your rice on the stove top instead of buying this model."
1,Don't waste your money on this rice cooker!,"This is a simple case of getting what you paid for. This rice cooker is a piece of garbage. The heating element heats up way too much, causing excessive bubbling which ends up spattering out the steam exhaust hole. If you leave it on the ""cook"" setting and wait for it to pop up itself, then count on having burnt rice. The only way I've been able to get it to cook rice properly is to prop the lid open and then manually flipping the switch to ""warm"" after about 5 minutes. It's less hassle to just cook the rice in a regular pot. Spend a few more bucks on a rice cooker that will work."
4,Perfect little rice maker,"This product makes cooking rice so easy. I always used to let rice boil over when I was cooking on the stove. I love the size, because it's the perfect amount for my family. I bought a rice cooker because I wanted to be able to make sushi rice, and I haven't been disappointed. And such a pretty color."
4,Great rice cooker for 2!,Wonderful for small amounts. The vegi steamer is a nice extra. {Only wish there was more color choices....but red is good.)
4,Great for rice,"I just used the rice cooker last night & it did a great job on the rice. It tasted great. However, I wouldn't recommend steaming fresh hearty veggies (like broccoli, carrots, or cauliflower) because they were all still hard even after leaving them in there for 45 minutes. It will probably be great for other veggies. I still love the simplicity of the design & the result of the rice. Not too mushy or dry. Make sure you let the rice steam for long enough after the water has evaporated."
2,Broke in a month or two,"Nice little cooker, but the button broke in about 2 months. I took it apart to try to fix it and the button is held on by two tiny screws into little plastic holders that were broken and ruined. I'm not hamfisted, so not a very strong setup for the only moving button on the thing. Oh well, that's why it's $15. Makes me mad though because now it's in the landfill and I would have gladly paid a few extra bucks (or more like 25 cents) so it would last longer."
4,I love my cute lil red rival rice cooker,"The reason why I give this 4 not 5 stars is because it huffs and puffs with so much steam during cooking that it's a bit noisy and sometimes foams up around the lid and makes the counter a bit messy. I guess that is what it takes, however, to cook rice well. It is DIFFICULT to cook good rice, so I have found, using the stovetop method. I am glad to have my lil red rival because it does a way better job that I can, and it's easy to clean, and it's very, very cute. Adorable. And inexpensive. And it hides away easily into the cupboard when I don't need it. I love it."
2,Not recomended. Died after 4 months,"I wanted a small rice cooker for myself, and found this in my local big box store. After several bad batches of rice, I finally started getting good results. I found that jasmine rice was giving me the best results, brown rice the worst. I also found that the sputtering that several people said that they got could be eliminated if you rinse the rice real good before putting it in the pot. Then one day I smelled that burnt electronics smell instead of the flavorful rice, and found the lights had all gone out. My rice cooker was dead. This was after just 4 months of use. Maybe it was still under warrantee, but it's cheap enough I didn't feel like spending the time finding out.I normally rate a product 1 star if it dies on me, however it really did make great rice. I would have given it 4 stars if it would not have died."
2,Worked for a couple months then -- kaput!,"This rice cooker worked fine for a couple months (I used it 6-8 times), then one day it just stopped working. The rice usually cooked ok, although there was always a crusty/chewy layer on the bottom. I also found it difficult to see the water measurement marks on the dark teflon. I wouldn't buy this again. Time for an upgrade..."
2,Not that great,"I'm surprised at how poorly this rice cooker works, considering all of the great reviews posted here. I followed the instructions provided, filling up the cooker with the appropriate amount of water & rice, and after about six uses, it hasn't cooked properly even one time. I always have to add about twice as much water. The manual also states that brown rice takes longer to cook, it should also say to add a lot more water. The cover doesn't seem to fit very well and inevitably, water collects on the outside of the lid while cooking.Finally, rice always burns on the bottom because the unit gets so hot - it doesn't burn so that it's not still edible, but it becomes brown and a bit rubbery.Overall, I'm not impressed with this unit at all and I would not recommend it to anyone."
3,Nice and Cheap,"I would have to say I had no problems cooking rice with this unit. It cooks rice allmost flawlessly everytime. You cant leave the warmer on too long though. For the Price you cant argue, but it is cheap. At around $14 you could replace it every year easy enough which is about what it needs. After 8 months of use the non-stick pan is flaking bad. Trust me a metal spoon as never touched this pan, we only use soft plastic spoons on it. Cleaning it, never been in the dishwasher, mild soap and sponge everytime. We use it quite often, everyday. The plastic hosing on the switch has cracked for no apparent reason. Again for the price its a great rice cooker, however next time I think I will try something better since we eat rice so much."
2,Worked well but...,"I got this rice cooker as a wedding gift. I loved it. It was just the right size for my husband and I. However, we've used it maybe 6 or 7 times and now it just won't work. For no reason whatsoever, the heating unit stopped heating. Still not a bad cooker for so little money, but beware."
2,It's cheap,"Like many here I was put off by the high prices on most rice cookers, so I went for this one despite mixed reviews. And 'mixed' is right -- even among those who rate it poorly, the specific reasons run quite a huge gamut. For me, the rice itself cooks pretty well and I had no issues with spills or overheating, but after maybe 4 months of moderate use, the #^&*@ switch wouldn't stay engaged; it pops into the 'Keep Warm' position prematurely -- typically after just a few minutes -- and has to be switched back, requiring major coaxing to get it to stay. This now happens at every use, as many as 3 times per cycle. Result: I have to be on alert the whole time, listening for the click that tells me the switch has popped up early. I can't have conversations in the kitchen, or even leave the room to watch TV or whatever. Really inconvenient, and isn't a rice cooker supposed to make things *more* convenient? Shopping for another brand now. Forget this one."
4,Met my expectations,For the price I recommend this printing calculator. It fulfills my need for such a product within my home.
4,Gossip Times Three- Great Book,"Gossip Times Three is an awesome book. It is by Amy Goldman Koss. It is about the life and the drama of three best friends, Abby, Bess, And Cristy.Abby has had a crush on this boy named Zack for a very long time. She always talks endlessly about him, and how he talked to her or glanced at her. She even carved his name in her drawer. But all of a sudden Bess blurts out right in the the middle of Abby's story about Zack, ""Zack's cute."" and Abby's immidiate reasponce is ""Duh-uh."" and continues her story. Later though, Bess also suddlenly comments ""Zack has a goofy smile."" This gives Abby a horrible feeling inside. Before you know it, Bess and Zack are boyfriend and girlfriend. This story continues with single mom troubles and of course, the Zack dilemma. It ends with a surprise.Any teenage girl should read this. It is a perfect story for middle school friendships and hardships. Although it can be confusing at times, it is a very enjoyable book."
1,worst book I have EVER read!!!!,"There is no point, and I don't exactly like the style of writing, it's nice the author acknowledges the reader but I mean come on! Asking the reader for the title of the book?!?! I'm sorry but I would not suggest this book to anyone else, if you want a good book read Olive's Ocean! Even Olive's Ocean has a better romance/cunning story in it! So in my opinion, pick another book! This easy read has way to much emphisis on the number THREE(3) and I personally was already sick or it by the 1 1/3 chapter!"
1,Worst book EVER!,"Very possibly the WORST book I have ever had the misfortune to come upon. It drones on and on and has absolutely no plot. The only people I recommend this book to are insomniacs. If you have trouble sleeping, just read this book and you'll fall asleep right away. Yeah. It's that bad."
3,THREE stars for the TRIO book,"this book is written in a very intresting. The author of the book acts like she is one the carachters. She goes a little off tracks sometimes,but all in all its a pretty good book."
2,"Nice truck,bad problems","I bought 2 of these trucks,they are very cool out of the box,they climb awesome and are pretty fast.They have really good suspension and even limited slip 4 wheel driv,but on both trucks ,within hours,neither if them would steer to the left.I returned them for 2 more,same exact problem .If you could buy maybe a steering motor for the front it would be good,but I cant find parts anywhere.So I give it a 3,It would be ok to give at a childs birthday party that you wont see for another year,but if you plan on keeping it,I would look elsewhere.Thanks for reading."
1,bad design or they did it in purpose,"I got it and put it together right the way. After about one minute of playing, the car won't turn at all, and there is a cracking sound fron the front part of the car gear box. It took me 10 mintues to open the from gear box and found a broken gear. The gear looks not normal at all (it has cut out a circle sharp and there is only 1 mm width of connecting material hold the inner and outer part of the gear). And on the 1 mm width, here even a small concave hole which weaken the gear further. No wonder it only ran for 1 minute.And I got it form the closing Toysrus store, And all sale were final. No exchange, no refund. And it's Toysrus's own brand Geoffery Inc. DO NOT buy this toy at all. Save you money buy something else."
1,Lousy customer service,I ordered the wrong size product. When I wrote the company asking if I could return it they wouldn't even answer my e-mail
4,Does the trick - for now...,"I use this to suspend contractor-grade garbage bags with them just touching the floor for recycling. So far it is performing fine, however I find the aluminum construction to be a bit flimsy, which concerns me since the seams are welded and could potentially stress-fracture over time. Price considered; I could justify buying a replacement in a couple of years if necessary."
4,just what I needed to keep garbage away from dogs,"I couldn't get my dogs to stop getting into the trash so we bought this to hang our garbage bags on the wall. It works great. The only downside is that it isn't meant for more than about 5 lbs of weight, so we have a rubbermaid container underneath it that the bottom of the garbage bag rests on. Now my dogs can't get to chicken bones and such. Also, you don't have the hassle of trying to pull the bag out of a bin, you just lift up the elastic around the top and take the bag out throught the bottom, so you can use more of the garbage bag."
3,"as ""generic"" as they come",It's a generic flash drive on a wristband that's somewhat uncomfortable if you have small wrists. There wasn't any password function or data security that came with it either. I've seen better but haven't actually tired them.
4,Wonderful cookbook with memories of Cuba,I am Cuban-American. Both parents were born in Cuba but emigrated in the 60's. My mother's cooking brings nostalgia that only true Cubans can relate to! This cookbook has such an assortment of recipes that will make anyone love Cuban food! I have received this book from my husband as a birthday present and it was such a nice surprise!
5,MEMORIES OF THE CUBAN KITCHEN: MORE THAN 200 CLASSIC RECEPIES,"I LOVE IT. EVEN THOU THE CARIBBEAN CUISINE HAS MANY COMMONALITIES, IT'S ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO FIND NEW PLATES AND NEW STORIES RELATED TO THE CUISINE."
5,My turn now...,"Being a Cuban-American I always counted on my parents to cook an authentic Cuban meal. Now I can do it myself and hope that my son will count on me to do it for him. This book is easy to understand,as well as a joy to read the stories of the authors family."
4,Cuban cuisine,"Very nice book about this cuban family thru history, the only thing is the use of cherry wine in almost all dishes."
5,"Awesome book, love it!","All I ever want to eat in the summer is Mexican food....however, this year I've been branching out into other Latin and Latin/Caribbean foods. I've been especially hooked on Cuban and this book ROCKS, just reading it is fun because the way she talks about being in Cuba as a little girl makes you wish you had a time machine and could go there. The majority of the recipes are fairly simple, nothing super crazy but they all look delicious and the ones I've tried have turned out super yummy and I'm sure all the others will too. The only thing I would add would be photos of the finished recipes...I'm very visual, especially in cookbooks...especially in a cuisine that is new to me so I don't already have a picture in my head of how it's technically supposed to look when it's done (though she's very descriptive and thorough in the recipe instructions so it works out). But even without any food photos I still love this book!"
2,Redundant,"This book has a lot of variations of similar recipes. For instance three variations of plantain soup, two of fish pudding and so on. Its more of a nostalgic look at Cuban cooking than a cookbook with creative ideas. There may be 200 recipes but why a recipe for cooking white rice that can be found on any bag of rice. Its a nice history of the authors experience and there are a few gems but do not buy this looking for new ideas. Very disappointing!"
3,Disappointed Cuban,"Just as my review for ""Cuban Chicks Can Cook"" this book has a whole was also a let down."
3,Some history too,Interesting tale of a Cuban immigrant family along with the recipes. All the recipes I have tried are yummy. Some ingredients are hard to find. Some od the specialty stuff is not well defined. But if you want to try a new cuisine and learn some Cuban history this is he book for you.
2,Sensi foot,"Like Sensi products very much, though this thong design really did not last long. Very comfortable and this is why I am purchasing a non thong model. Hope to get more life out of the different design. Like the water drainage system, but I think they should design an anti bacterial version. Other than that it is a very comfortable practical working sandal."
4,Great Flip Flops for the beach,"These are very comfortable. They have a little arch support and have a raised area for your toes to grip. The heel is dipped in and is comfortable. These are great shower, pool and beach shoes and the water drains out of them. They are a little heavier than your normal flip flop."
1,Don't bother,"These are very much hard plastic thongs (and I do mean hard plastic), they are very narrow and not very comfortable and I just took a couple of steps in them and they rubbed the sides of my feet so hard I knew I could not wear them to walk around in or I would have blisters or missing skin"
2,runs too small,"these are great sandals, but they run very small on sizing. I normally wear a 7 1/2, and an 8 in sensi sandals, but these in an 8were way too small--my heel hung over the back!!"
4,Excellent book for all hockey parents,"I picked up this book hoping it would keep my attention. It has been several years since I have read an entire book. I was not disappointed. Not only did I read it from front to back in a day, then my husband read it, then my ten year old son. It is truly a book interesting for the whole family. Our family could relate to most of the experiences described in the book. The book shows what parents go through for their young children and how the children turn around and can make you so proud. The book does not ""surgar coat"" anything, he tells it like it is, good or bad."
2,Inspirational true story of the McCarty family.,"Craig McCarty, father of back-to-back Stanley Cup winner Darren McCarty of the NHL's Detroit Red Wings, tells the inspirational story of his son's journey to the National Hockey League as well as his own battle against cancer. Although this book is filled with inspiration, Craig McCarty is a father, not an author, and it shows."
1,Doesn't work,"I got this machine a couple days ago hoping to make ice cream. After following the instructions carefully and chilling the canister for 24 hours, I plugged it in, and 40 minutes later I had a few ice crystals in the mixture. Thinking I'd done something wrong, I refroze the canister after turning down the thermostat on my freezer to make it even colder. I also made sure the mixture was chilled to just above freezing before trying again. After 30 minutes mixing, I had a soupy mess with big grainy ice crystals in it, but not ice cream. I'm going to return this and get something from a different manufacturer."
4,"Decent, but a bit slow","I love the taste of fresh ground salt -- it's much better than the canned alternative. I really like the Chef'n Salt Ball since I can grind salt with one hand -- really helpful when I'm adding salt to a recipe. My only gripe would be that it doesn't dispense a whole lot of salt on each grind... but that lets you easily control the amount of salt to dispense.It's a great combination with the Chef'n Pepper Ball. One word of warning: it's bigger than you may think. The ball is easily between three and four inches wide, and the handles go up a good distance -- maybe five inches. Don't think of this as the size of a normal salt shaker (the pictures make it hard to see how big it is)."
4,good but not the best,They followed the story line but it was not as good at the Bette Davis one. But I love Katharine Hepburn so it was worth buying. She is a wonderful actress.
2,Not one of Pronzini's best,"I'm currently devouring every book in Bill Pronzini's fantastic Nameless Detective series, in order. So far, they've all been terrific, but I must admit that I had to force myself to finish this one. Is it because we actually learn the Nameless Detective's name! Is it that the final plot twist is foreshadowed to the point where a six-year-old could guess what was coming? The story is told in alternating points of view by Pronzini's PI and Wilcox's police detective; that technique worked far better in Pronzini's ""Double"" (which he wrote with his wife, Marcia Muller). ""Twospot"" was a disappointment, but I look forward to reading the rest of the series."
3,Stiff,"I thought these were like the soft ones I used in the hospital, but they are much stiffer & I didn't want to use them on my baby's bottom unless they were thoroughly wet first. I kept them to use as a backup if I ran out of the Medline ultrasoft wipes that I found out the hospital used (I love those), but I wouldn't use these dry on my baby's bottom."
2,Not as interchangeable as it looks,I can't interchange these heads with Pinky dolls without them looking like they have no neck. But overall they're super cute!
2,Not nearly as good as the Victorinox Swiss Army Rambler Pocket Knife,"The Wenger knife is much bulkier and more cheaply made than the Victorinox and the scissors are dull and less effective with fine work, though the Wenger scissors spring looks sturdier. The one nice added feature is the nail clipper, but it doesn't work as well as some standard nail clippers. The other nice option is a knifeless version for air travel, but I've decided I'll stick to the Victorinox and nail clippers for every day use and nail clippers plus small scissors and toothpick in my travel toiletry kit for air travel. The Wenger knife was unfortunately a waste of my money."
4,Great Nail Clippers,Best fingernail clippers I've bought in thirty years! A little bulky for a pocket but great for a purse. My daughter swears by hers also. Shipping and handling was a little expensive but timely.
4,Nice little tool,"I got this for my friend who recently graduated and passed her driver's test - with her newfound mobility I wanted her to have a little multitool. She's a girly girl, loves all things pink, so I figured this would be perfectly suited to her tastes and needs. Thankfully, I was right!! She absolutely loves it. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that the clippers seem to flip out of the sheath a bit too easily, but other than that, it's a handy little tool. And the watermelon pink looks fantastic!"
2,review,this dvd can stay on the shelf its not so good if you seen the show on bet to me it was a waste of money in not what i was expecting so dont bother to buy it it straight up BS
5,BOA IS THE BEST EVER!!!!!,The first review is just completely wrong...SHE IS THE BEST SINGER EVER!!!
3,Not her Best But Better Than The Last,With BoA's popularity in Korea dwindling you would think they would put out some descent material.This album is just carbon copied american artists.Many of the songs sound like last years top 40.Not that its a bad thing.Stand out tracksMy NameSparkI Dont Give a DamnI KissMaybe Maybe NotMost of the songs are sickly sweet ballads.The tracks above really stand out.
5,Informative!,"If you want to learn about Dinosaurs, the people who look for them and how they find them, this is an excellent video. It also describes different views on the extinction of Dinosaurs, as well as new information on how some of them lived. I was also very surprised that it contained information on finds in Argentina! There is also some information on the Jurasic. Most videos concentrate on the Cretaceus, I don't know if it's due to lack of information or the popularity of T-Rex. If you want to learn, not just be entertained I recomend this video."
1,BROKEN DVD,I received the dvd a couple of weeks before Christmas. It was a gi\ft for my son. I was disappointed when he opened it on Christmasmorning to discover the dvd was briken in 3 pieces. My daughter has cancer and started chemo the next morning. I was not able to contact anyone about the movie till now. I was complegtely dissatisfied!
2,Not up to par,"This DVD is no where near as good as other films that Discovery has done. They can't even spell renaissance correctly on the DVD menu. Bought this for my 8 year old, who is a dinosaur fan, but some of the footage seem to be the same that is at the Field Museum in Chicago. Major disappointment for us."
1,Dinosaurs,I am very disappointed in this. It is a documentary and there is barely any dinosaurs on it!!!!! Not worth getting for a toddler:(
2,Note to parents: this DVD is NOT for toddlers,"Like so many other reviewers, I got this DVD for my 3.5 year old son yesterday who is fascinated by dinosaurs. It was very boring, and I felt deceived by the metal box in which it came which somehow led me to believe that it was more about animated computer graphic recreations of dinosaur life, not scenes upon scenes of paleontologists digging around for bones and interviews with scientists.I'm not saying it's a bad DVD. Surely an older crowd can appreciate it. But this is definitely not what I was looking for for my toddler."
4,Better than the cover would indicate,"Despite the incredibly tacky and lurid cover (and decidedly no-frills packaging in general), this is a competent and entertaining series. Nothing that a well-versed dinosaur enthusiast doesn't know, but a pretty intro-level series. Watchable and informative. Better than the horrible cover would indicate."
2,I love dinosaur DVDs,"How fasinating these type DVDs are. And, one learns so much re: the evolution of this planet. I wasn't, however, very impressed with this particular DVD."
5,North American Falconry and Hunting Hawks (Silver Anniversary Edition) [Hardcover],Great book great buy AAAA++++++++++++++++ Has many helpful chapters for any one looking for Falconry Info.Would buy again in a heart beat.
3,Feng what?,"I have read quite a number of Feng Shui books, some written by Masters, and I did not feel this book was quite up to it. There seems to be quite a number of discrepancies. The writer does not place the Bagua (ie direction) the same as the Masters (this is confusing). Also, she encourages one to place plants in every room - which is not the case. The bedroom and bathroom, it is said, should not have plants.Another, she says to place plants on either side of the front door; however, Lilian Too cautions one to ensure they are not too similar and upright, ie representing joss sticks burning for the dead. Some of the writer's points are basic, and valid but due to the discrepancies, i'm a bit wary in believing all she says as gospel. I prefer the books by Lilian Too, who gives more detail and more information and seems more in line with the other masters."
5,His music is great!,"I live in Los Angeles, and saw his video on a latin show! I guess his music is also very popular in Latin-America. A few days later I went to Tijuana and they were also playing his music on a small shop in downtown TJ. This is unbelievable! His music is crossing frontiers at the speed of light! I had to have his CD afer that and I am very happy I did."
5,Love his music,You don't need to understand the lyrics of this CD. The rythm and the beautiful voice of Tarkan will captivate you.
5,From Japan,"I do not understand a word of what he says, but when I was browsing I felt to buy the cd. I listen to it daily. I love it. It gives me a sense of being a woman. I truly love his voice and the heart that he puts into his songs. I have never been to Turkey and do not know anyone. Nevertheless, I love the cd."
3,Tarkan,"There are three songs that I like out of the whole CD. I don't understand Turkish, so the melody sounds a bit more like Indian. The CD was worth what I paid for: $6 plus $5 S&H."
4,Dance Music--Turkish Style!,"I don't speak Turkish, but I think the music on this cd is simply hot. Initially, I bought it for its very Middle Eastern first track, Simarik, but quickly fell in love with the other tracks too. There is a great variety to the music on here, from traditional Middle Eastern pop to Western-style dance tracks. But Tarkan's lyrical delivery is outstanding regardless of the musical style, ranging from playful to urgent and passionate to sheer sensual.Well worth every penny you spend on the purchase!"
5,Tarkan...The Nex Ricky Martin,"I myself love this cd..Tarkan has came a long ways to make it where he is now...He is one of the greatest pop artists..And I have an suggestion if you don't like international songs, don't listen to them..and don't dis em...keep your comments to yourselves...But it is a great CD...all of his songs are great.."
4,Fantastic Turkish Music! So Modern!,"Tarkan is my new obsession. His first track (the song of the kiss) is my favorite. He combines fun, energy, a little bit of techno, with exciting tunes. I don't speak a word of Turkish, but somehow I find myself singing along. I'd imagine he's a very good performer. Get it!"
2,"Too ""ethnic"" but refreshingly different","On one hand, Tarkan's Turkish lyrics are a bit too unfamiliar for the Western ear. On the other hand, his breakthrough album is something new and different, refreshingly different.There's a great deal of variation as well, and the album is well-produced.Still, only a few of the songs are worth the attention."
5,Looks like glass but has the durability of plastic,What can I say? I had to buy another group of glasses because they looked sooo good. I prefer glasses So this set gives me the best of both worlds. The Pretty look of glass with the duability of plastic. (unbreakable) It really is sheer elegance.I simply love them.
5,Accurate gauge,"Doubled checked with several other tire pressure gauges, this gauge performs admirably. Definitely worth the money and will recommend to anyone needing a tire gauge for motorcycles or cars."
1,China Junk!,These are made in China now and are complete junk! Bleeder valve wont seal to hold air for you to read the pressure amount like thier supposed to. Bought 5 of them they all failed within a a few light uses....Buy another brand or style. Myself I'm changing brands.
1,Different gauge sent than advertised,"I should have listened to the other reviewers that had a problem with their order of this gauge ... I e-mailed the seller to be proactive and make sure I get the right item.Seller assure that it is the correct gauge. Then the delivery arrives and Surprise! Wrong item. They sent me a 100psi gauge without air release button ... Should havesent the 0-60psi gauge with push-button air release valve.Amazon, please tell this seller NOT to mislead customers ... we don't have time to deal with sellers that mislead customers.PC"
1,Item shipped was not item ordered,I wish I had heeded the reviews of others. Item that was ordered was not item that was received. Trying to file a refund has proven difficult. I suggest you find this item somewhere else.
1,Gauge Works But Is Not The One Pictured,"I ordered one of these gauges from Amazon several months ago. I like it very much as it has range enough to measure my RV tires and resolution and accuracy enough for my low pressure lawn tractor tires. So, I ordered another to keep one in the tow vehicle and one in the garage. However, I did not receive the same gauge as before and not the same as the one pictured. The one I received has a straight shaft (no angled adjustable head) and no means of locking the pressure reading.Amazon may not have sufficient control of its suppliers, but they should not allow things like this to happen. An inexpensive item like this is not worth the trouble returning, but I am disappointed. The gauge I received just will not work properly for some of the measurements that I have to make."
4,Good gauge at a good price point,"Gauge works great , very easy to read the exact pressure as it holds the pressure reading until you release it. The bleeder is good but doesnt release air very fast at all ( approx 1/10th of a pound per second ) ,which was weird having never used one with a push button bleeder. Thought it would be faster but it will help get pressure exactly on the dot. Would buy again. Only slight cons are it should have a protective boot included and the brassy outside looks too gold like and doesn't look like it will maitain its look for a long time. I personally don't care about that much but worth noting.BTW I got the $40 moroso gauge - this one was within a pound and so was my $1 Victor dial gauge for the local auto store lol."
1,Received a different gauge than the one advertised,"The gauge I received has a 100 psi range, no bleed valve and an angle chuck; it is not the gauge pictured on Amazon. The seller did not respond to my email. I filed a claim with Amazon and they are refunding."
1,Not What I Ordered (not even close),I ordered a 0-60 psi gauge (the gauge I received was 0-100 psi) with a bleeder valve (the gauge I received has no bleeder valve) and a straight chuck (the gauge I received has an angled chuck). Totally unacceptable.
4,Not Bad Not Great,"1st off, free shipping!!This vest isn't a bad investment. The stitch work on the vest is really good. Holds together great. Delivery was pretty quick as well. The only quams I have with this vest is the lifecord and the rifle pad on the shoulder. I can only get three fingers in the lifecord. The recoil pad is just stuffed cotton if not less. Not hard at all."
4,tactical vest,This vest is well worth the money my son loves it.It is heavier than i would have thought.Lots of pockets and made strong.
4,Genghis Khan & the Mongol Horde,"This book was on our son's summer reading list. It was a good book to better understand history. We felt it was a little young for our son's age which is 14, but it was easy to read and did give insight as to who Genghis Khan was and how he operated."
2,Watch Not Working At All,"I have purchased two Pirelli watches for my husband. This one does not work. It does not keep time. We had it sized to his wrist and then noticed that it does not keep the correct time. Not sure what to do about this. Return it, if I even can.What to do?"
3,No dimensions given,"Since no dimensions are given, I ordered the only one I could find that said it was rectangular. I don't have any documentation on the model number of the falls and didn't feel like digging it up to look for one. The filter pads don't have any numbers on them either so that makes it pretty much impossible to order successfully from Amazon.The one they sent was only 10x14, way too small for my filter.Rated it OK because there isn't anything wrong with the filter, just the poor description. Shouldn't have to order just to find out the size. Maybe the manufacturer could invest in a tape measure and save us all a lot of grief."
2,Not a guided meditation,I thought this would be a guided meditation by Carolyn Myss. It is just music so I really can't give an opinion as to whether it is a good meditation CD. I sent it back once I realized it was just music.
2,Too much talk,"Too much talk keeps me in my head. The ambient music is pleasant enough but does nothing to shift me energetically. In my opinion, this is NOT true chakra healing music.A highly recommended alternative is ""CRYSTAL VOICES"" - it has a guided chakra meditation with a soothing, clear voice (not too much of it) and the healing vibrations of chakra tuned crystal singing bowls in the background that help you shift into alpha state, that place of deep relaxation and healing. You will FEEL the energy moving in your chakras with Crystal VOices. The best 20 minute chakra tune-up that I know of! I use it with all my clients and for group meditations."
2,Should be Grand Boredom,"Interesting with being first big star ensemble, but other than that this is a major waste of time. More of a curiosity piece than anything else."
3,"Good overview, but not detailed","This is a good overview to hand a beginning avionics or flight controls engineer who needs to get familiar with the very basic principles of inertial nav. Good coverage of various types of instruments, but many of the designs covered are outdated and of little use in modern design work. Given the paucity of works in this field, I welcomed it as an introductory text, but you could not perform any serious trade studies for a real design with only the knowledge in this book. It doesn't cover GPS in any depth, or the important topic of GPS/INS blending. Other topics missing are a good intro to optical gyros (Sagnac effect) and the overall integration of nav systems (steering modes, landing systems, cooperative nav, effects on weapons delivery, and so on). Still, for the money, I would recommend it to a neophyte who has some extra cash...you have to start somewhere!"
3,A modern source in a modest body of literature,"The technology in the field is quite advanced, and the research is particulary active and in costant evolution. Producing a comprehensive reference is quite difficult but the author delivers clearly the advantages and disadvantages of each system analyzed in the book. As a guide, the work has neatly reached its goal, since it delivers a clear picture of the current state of art and the trend of each system development. In fact the author is covering every subject quite extensively without the dispersion of innumerable specific technical papers, which are, of course, much more detailed but far from comprehending the scope of the whole field.The only point is the mathematical level,that is maybe too simple for engineers and scientists, and a little bit complicated for the average pilot, one of the most interested user in the field."
5,Lift Shocks,"Most Excellent, They fit and function perfectly. Plus I saved over 30% from buying local. Such a deal!!! Thank you."
5,Renewed my passion,"For those, like me, who find themselves wondering why such hard work for jobs, family, church, etc. result in such little joy and satisfaction, Mr. MacDonald's writing may bring some solice. I found great relief in his experiences and antecdotes and also found the initiative to investigate why I lacked spritual passion. The book provided me with answers as to why I lacked passion, what sapped my passion and what elements could be placed in my life to maintain passion. This book was recommended to me and I would recommend (and have recommended) it to others."
5,I wish they'd make another for the rest of the books!,"I absolutely LOVE having the first 10 books on my computer! It was interesting that they were in the extras portion of the program so I had to do a bit of searching, but they were there, along with the program to use them. The program can even have the computer sound out the words so they can be a type of audio book. I just hope they do the same thing with the remaining 6 books.The other stuff included is prophecy teaching material that I haven't looked through yet. (I only got it a few days ago).Another good thing is that once you install it, you don't have to put the cd in your computer every time you use it.Anyway, I highly recommend it!"
3,Not what I thought it was,I was not able to get it to do what I claimed it would do. I was very disappointed because I LOVED the books.
3,could have problems,Ordered 2 phones and upon arrival one immediately did not work. I did get a no hassle exchange but at my expense on postage for return of broken phone. Bottom line is you get what you pay for. They are indeed cheap for a 2 line caller id phone.
2,Troublesome,"It worked fine for a few months then problems develop. I might intermittingly lose Caller ID...or the ability to dial out...or the ability to hear the voice on the other end. Usually only one function malfunctioned at a time. I searched for clues...The summary screen might say ""REC"" or it might say ""Timer"". I would search through the User's Guide but found no reference to either term.Maybe someone more of a technophile than me could troubleshoot the problem. Good luck!"
4,"Great audio for low-cost, low-profile computers","Bought a refurbished HP Slimline for just over $300 to connect to home audio system. Copied over 500 CD's onto hard drive as 320kbps .mpg's. Great concept, but noticeable audio distortion from the Slimline's integrated audio, even after adding 2MB of RAM. The Low Profile SoundBlaster card made a great low-cost solution. Sound now quite respectable, perhaps not good enough for a true audiophile but just fine for my old ears."
1,"For soundfonts, try a different software","When I bought this from Amazon for $28, I was under the assumption that this would be compatible with my Cakewalk Music creator 4. I was wrong! i installed it and when I opened Cakewalk, it said it wasn't compatible. After downloading the drivers for the sound card online, I was okay. But then I installed Vienna studio because the CD this sound card comes with doesn't have a Sound bank manager. It may say that but the features listed is quite misleading. Once Vienna was installed, to my surprise, I tried opening and it said that my sound card doesn't support sound fonts!I'm gonna get my money back this time and exchange it for another card because this is ridiculous! Creative labs has a great sound but when it comes to sound fonts, the Audigy SE, it's not the best option--stay away from this product!"
4,Don't kill the messenger,"This is a great book regardless of the fact that Henry WAS a member of the International Churches of Christ. It's a well thought-out, well written book about getting intimate with your creator. It's a product of his own search for God and his return to God-centered worship and devotion that is solid and sound. It's full of good theology and tries to get the reader focused on God - and off the world. Henry was also the one who wrote the ""Honest to God"" letter that was the shot heard 'round the world and exposed a lot of sin in the ICC churches throughout the world (I'm sure that any internet search of the letter or the author would yield a wealth of results). Henry is serious about God, and from what I can tell always has been. This is a great book about getting back to the real reason that anyone is a Christian in the first place - to bow before the eternal God and seek his favor."
2,Stupid,"This is a waste of money the information is VERY clear quote ""regarless of the vehicle you drive, you need to know where you are going."" you would think if you want to go to Disneyland you would know where it is or already have a map to it. my opinion dont buy this it is stupid. there is some information but it isnt worth buying. I like the "" The Unofficial Guide to Disneyland, by Bob Sehlinger."""
5,Fantastically Funny!!! A must read for summer fun!!!!,"If you are a Billie Letts fan then you must read this hilarious collection of letters from Molly Levite Griffis to her friend and adopted sister, Billie!! As Billie says,""It's all lies, and the parts that aren't lies are the truth, to somebody, somewhere. I think!"" Since I happen to be the ""other"" sister in the book, I can say with certainty that my sister, Molly, has been known to improve on the truth. It will make you laugh and it might make you cry, but it will make you glad that you read it!! Of that, I am certain!!"
4,It's like reading someone's diary,"I enjoyed reading these letters between best friends. Reminds me of my own letters from best friends I've kept over the years ... maybe not so cleverly written, but just as dear and fun to read. Molly and Billie are fortunate, blessed to have each other. Bet they have hilarious pajama parties! and get togethers ... and understanding, patient, husbands. Keep the letters coming, ladies. I know I'm looking forward to more."
2,Wasn't what I expected....,"Sorry, I just didn't enjoy this book but took it to our library perhaps it will appeal to someone else..."
1,Strange,Being a Bille Letts fan I ordered this book based on the reviews and because I'd run out of material to read by her. What a letdown. I felt like the author seemed obsessive and overbearing in her like for Bille Letts.
5,This pan gets better with time,"I also bought this pan for multi-purposes. When you want to heat up tortillas or make a nice egg omelet this pan heats up beautifully. It also works nicely in the oven with homemade mini-pizzas. I do agree that you need the correct temp and a little vegetable oil to achieve a non-stick surface, also, it helps if the batter or eggs are room temp. The more you use it the better non-stick effect it achieves. It is one of the most useful pans in the kitchen and a healthier alternative to teflon pans.Whenever the outer enamel gets any stubborn sticky grease, I use a little oven cleaner and it comes off easily without having to scrub.This pan is also lighter than many other good cast iron crepe pans, and yet is still very sturdy and durable."
4,Mr Frost not so chilling,"I watched the last part of this movie years ago on cable then never saw it again to watch the whole thing. I finally bought a copy and loved it! Jeff Goldblum & Kathy Baker spar as Satan and his doubtful doctor, who finally is convinced of who he is after a few dramatic events occur. Nothing gory or especially suspenseful happens; it's more a terror of the mind and not the heart, as Baker's character realizes the depths of Satan's power and what she must do for him. Very unusual movie which almost no one has seen, but for anyone interested in the battle between true good and pure evil, it's a not-to-be missed psycho-thriller."
4,Jeff Goldblum's Mr. Frost,"This movie was very well done. Jeff Goldblum is an excellent actor, and though he keeps a lot of his own personal traits though the movie (i.e pausing while he speaks and so on), it's quite interesting. I don't see, however, how it could be rated R or be a horror - other than the fact Satan's in it. The is next to no blood and it is NOT scary. Not a very heard-of movie, it's actually quite hard to find. Interesting thoughts on Good and Evil. Quite Enjoyable."
3,"Great Goldblum, Poor Movie","Goldblum's performance is intensely chilling and disarmingly charming as needed for Evil personified. His tall, dark, and strong physique also reinforces the immense black power of the character. Most of the dialogue was well-written and thought-provoking. The cinematography was occasionally creative and suspenseful, but more often awkward. The cheesy score, wooden acting from others, and the disjointed plot ruined the total effect for me. Overall, I give the film a 5 for Goldblum's casting and acting, and a 2 for all other aspects."
3,Mr. Frost,"The movie was not in as good condition as stated, it appears to have been a rental movie actually.Good thing that I know how to take apart an old vhs because it was re-wound so tightly it broke from the spool and I had to splice it back together.It arrived in great time, no complaints there. Wrapped very well and care was taken to ensure it wasn't damaged in transit. Kudos for that, but no so much for the condition."
5,Two Words..,Bunny CrackA must have for all discerning bunny parents. Our 3 bunnies would sell their souls for one. Recommended to us by our Vet who specializes in rabbits.
3,Well made little film.,"There isn't a dull moment in this strange, bittersweet entry in the 'Howling' franchise. The plot is about a drifter (With a British Accent) who finds himself in some small town in Sounthern California. Later on, a carnival arrives, a carnival of freaks. We later find out that the carnival owner R.B Harker is a vampire.Well, if this film was made in the 1930's or 40's & Lon Chaney starred as the werewolf and Bela Lugosi played the vampire, it would have been a classic today, but unfortunately the film was released at a time were we had a lot of those ""Slasher flicks"" coming out.Overall, Good acting, average special effects. Lacks the humour shown in previous parts..."
3,"eerie, believable study of conflicting forces",Brendan Hughes as the tortured half human half werewolf gave a touching performance eliciting a feeling of compassion in me as Lon Chaney Jr. did in the old werewolf movies.
3,Throwback to Universal Monster Bashes.,"Okay, it's cheap. Okay, it has nothing to do with the original, other than a werewolf is involved in the story. If you liked Frankenstein Vs. The Wolf Man, House of Frankenstein, and House of Dracula, however, you might like this. A werewolf, the protagonist, hunts down a vampire, the antagonist, who happens to own a circus. Shades of Tod Browning's Freaks here, as a number of freaks are involved in the story. Pretty interesting and somewhat nostalgic."
2,delay and denial,"There was a delay in shipping then a notice that it isn't available, unappreciated."
1,Crashed System,"Might be a good product, but my PC ran into problems when I tried to install software. Everthing seemed fine, then when the PC restarted, the system kept crashing. Finally, I had to remove the software and return the product. I think I'm going to buy a new computer with a DVD burner already installed. By the time I upgrade my PC to accept this external burner and factor in the $120 for the burner itself, I could spend a little more and have a new PC. Lesson: check the system requirements!"
3,Memorex DVD RECORDER review,"Honestly, i would like some more time to evaluate the product. I had some difficulties with the software and have now accessed the correct software for the Recorder. I will be soon making use of both and should be able to do a bettter evaluation at the end of this month."
2,Hasn't burned a DVD yet -- software problem?,"The hardware _seems_ okay: plays DVDs extremely well with my old version of PowerDVD, and burns CDs with pretty good speed (I've got a firewire connection.) But so far, I've been unable to burn a DVD in any of the packaged Nero applications, not as backup, not as a data disc. (Even the DVD player doesn't work, just keeps popping up a reminder to buy the plug-in.) When burn is attempted with a DVD, disc gives target error, program can't make End of File, or disc isn't recognized at all. I will reluctantly invest in different media (maybe it didn't like these DVD+R discs, though it's supposed to handle DVD+R) and if that's no help, uninstall the Nero and try other burners. If hardware pans out and Nero is the only problem, will come back and raise to three stars (or better, if really fast)."
2,Not very durable,"I purchased this burner a little over a year ago and at first it worked fine. I was always very careful with it. Kept it in a safe spot on my desk and only got to copy about 50 discs before it went berserk on me. Three months ago it stopped functioning correctly. The driver just spins uncontrollably whenever I try to copy a disc or reproduce it. It just goes on and on and doesn't stop unless I manually interrupt it. Error messages popping up all over the place. I thought it was a glitch with my computer, so I reinstalled the software into another computer. The same problem occurred. It won't read the discs properly, nor will it burn them. I have given up, and since the warranty has expired, there's nothing I can do. Bad investment considering I only produced 50 dvds/cds. Next time, I'll try another brand and cheaper, too."
2,Cheap,"Ive had this product for about 4-5 months now, it worked okay at the beginning of it's life, had a couple writing errors that were troubleshooted to be a malfunction in the drives writing process, wasn't too pleased with that. Now, 5 months later, i cant burn more than 5 MB of data to a disk without the drive freezing up and spitting out an error or 10. So unless i want to burn 5 MB of a 600 MB file at a time, it's been rendered useless to me.Looked around online and it appears I'm not the only one who has had this type of issue with this product."
4,Memorex DVD Double Layer Recorder 16 x 16,"It took some time to configure things with my computer but seems to work well and does the job. I have installed some new software ""Nero"" to the unit and have had little difficulty. Price is OK."
5,Hooray for Memorex!,"This computer-challenged granny hooked this unit up to my Dell in less than 5 minutes, then painlessly installed the software, and burned my firt DVD all by myself! Sigh. The unit is NOT flimsy and makes no noise at all. The instruction booklet is written in real English and is easy to understand. It took about 45 minutes to make a back-up copy of a full length movie. I have no idea what all the techno-speak was about in the other reviews. I just basically did a ""plug and play"" and I'm thrilled."
4,"Good Drive, Good Price",Fast and reliable drive. Easy to set up and get going. My only complaint is that it's a little noisier than other drives I've used.
4,Be aware,"Works just fine - but - comes up to speed when reading like a prop plane revving up. Not a problem, just kind of surprising at first.Also - if you are adding this to a box that already has a dvd drive, you may have to turn this off to boot up normally. Easy swiching though.Keeper!Bought one for each of my main computers. An HP drive, when added-on with an existing dvd drive, almost destroyed my system and the outsourced support was abominable."
5,Memorex review,"The DVD Recorder works well and does what it is supposed to do. It has a quirk in that if you don't have the machine on before booting up, it will only appear as a CD recorder."
2,keep shopping - bundled software won't work on Vista,"I just bought this drive - it came bundled with Nero v6.6 which DOES NOT work with Windows Vista. I contacted Memorex support about this problem and they told me to get the latest update from Nero. Unfortunately, there are no updates to Nero 6 that make it compatible with Vista - you have to upgrade to Nero 7, which costs more than I paid for the drive. Memorex ignored my follow-up request for a free solution to the problem they caused. I will be returning this drive and getting a Sony that comes with Nero 7. Current products should come with software that works on current operating systems."
1,Computers would not recognize it,"When it first arrived, I plugged it into my usb 2 port. Computer would not recognize it. After trying everything I and google newsgroups could think of, I took it to work -- none of my work computers would recognize it either. Sent it back, got another one. Plugged it in, the computer immediately recognized it. Cool ... i thought. I turned it off, and shut down the for the night. Next day, turned it on .... nothing!! Computer would not recognize it. Took it to work, and the computer reported ""problem with usb device"" Sent it back, got a refund, and I am going to get an internal (non-usb!!) drive."
1,misunderstood,"Ok, when I bought this product online I thought I was buying a machine that would burn my digital videos from my camcorder unto a disk that I could play back on my dvd player. So far it hasn't done that. It will copy unto the disk and it will playback on my PC, but not on my dvd player. When I received the nero 6 software I didn't know I had to upgrade to the nero 7 in order to edit and copy my movies to a dvd.I guess I misunderstood what this recorder was for. It's not exactly what I wanted. Thank you."
3,at least its cheap,I've had the unit ofr around 3 months. It does write fairly quickly--i think the numbers are alittle exagerated. My biggest problem it the reading. when ripping audio and video it doesn't skip but there isn't any/enough ram so when playing audio or video directly from the unit it tends to skip...a lot. Don't bother expecting to playing anything unless you opened the disk in a clean room.
1,Same problem as other reviewers,I had the same problem as another reviewer where it would recognize the drive one time and then it never did again.
4,Good for the money,"I got this dvd burner 2 days ago. I have already burned 10 dvds with this. It is a good-looking burner. It can lay flat, or it has a stand for vertical placement. It was easy to connect to the computer and install the provided software.It comes with Nero. This seems to be a really good program. Unfortunately, some of the features, like creating dvd movies, are only 30 day trials, and not included with the program. To get the dvd movie feature, it costs $25. I was unhappy when I realized that I didn't get the entire Nero program, especially since I wanted this dvd burner so I could create movies that would play on my dvd player hooked to my tv. But, the program is very easy to use and has thus far been reliable.It takes about an hour to transcode the data into the correct format, then the actual time it takes to burn the disc is very quick."
1,Memorex 32023288 DVD Double-Layer Recorder 16x16,"We tried for several days to get the nero software to operate with our dell laptop. We updated, filled out forms, read the reviews to get hints - nothing worked. It would play the sound ok, but the picture was a bunch of colored lines - ie, no picture. It was a hassle and I finally returned it. The problem was the included nero software, not the hardware - go figure."
5,"Buy it, you'll like it",Couldn't be happier...Currently hooked to USB2.0 port.. burns full DVD-r 8x in appx 8 minutes..Can't wait to try in on a Firewire port with a 16x DVD :)
4,All in all - good,"Looking at the picture of the product posted, I thought I was getting the 'complete' box, not so. No instructions, no software."
3,The USB Can Slow You Down,"This product doesn't seem to work any better or worse than its competitors, but keep in mind that you'll only really get the maximum burn speeds if you're using an internal or Firewire drive. The USB connection limits the write speed, sometimes severely. If you're plugged directly into the motherboard, you might get 8x out of it, but if you're in a hub or something, you'll probably go down to 4x. If you're really in need of superfast burning, then I recommend that you clear a drive bay in your desktop and get an internal drive with a large buffer. I can get 16x in my desktop (IDE) but only 4x max on this USB unit.Otherwise, the unit works just fine."
4,great recorder,Great piece of machinery. Worked super right out of the box. Software easy to work with for a computer challenged person like me.Eventhough the program did not jive with the supplied book and instructions. I would like to delete some functions like it says I can in the book but it is not possible. Overall it's a great product. Speedy delivery also
2,why I didnot install theis product.,"I did not find this product satisfactory because it requiresd the installation of Nero. I have a copy of Nero already installed, but it is a later edition than that contained in this product. To use the new product I would have to uninstall the later version which I would not do so I have not used this system. It's too bad it appears I just blew my money. TS"
4,"It's a basic phone, keep expectations moderate.","I would give this phone 3.5-4 stars. I've seen some bad reviews for it, but it's mostly from people who expected performance and versatility of a Blackberry. It's a good basic phone, with a few less features than other phones. If you're looking for a practical phone, this is a good choice IF:1. You can live without a camera on your phone (like <1 megapixel camera does anyone any good)2. You can live without speakerphone (I don't know anyone who utilizes that feature when thet have it anyways)3. You don't have to have the flashiest, fanciest, most cutting edge phone on the market.I wouldn't sign a contract to get this phone, I'd get one off the major auction website (begins with an ""e"", ends with a ""bay""), where you can get it for about $30."
1,A Real Piece of...Junk,"I will have to disagree with the positive reviews on this phone -- mine is a real piece of crap! The phone, although the battery lasts for several days, has terrible reception, terrible menus (it will always go to the online shopping option first), the screen cuts out, the hinge mechanism is loose, the call volume fluctuates, and God forbid you sign a 2-year service plan like I did. There's a little mirror on it, but for what? It has a status light, but does nothing useful -- no clock, no caller ID, and as a mirror, it reflects an area about the same size as your eye, if you hold it out at arm's length. Stay away from this phone at all costs. Get a Nokia, Motorola, Sony, ANYTHIN but this LG. LG may make refridgerators, washers, dryers, and other household appliances, but they certianly can't make a phone."
2,Enough to boil water,"I bought it when its price was around only $6 and it seemed such a good deal for a stainless steel. Here are the pros and conspros: enough to boil water, inexpensive, light, stainless steelcons: cover is tight, hard to take off. Do not use the Whistling spout as it is hard to put on and take off. body is very thin.Overall its shining and thin body gave me the feeling of being afraid of a CUT(like a paper edge cut). But overtime that feeling eventually went away. I just got used to it.The main problem about this item is the Whistling spout - no use as it is too hard to put on and off. It is like a rust."
2,Spout's top gets too hot,Heats well but the top on the spout gets too hot and is too hard to remove for fast pouring.
3,Get's the job done,The metal is so thin that it sound like a train is coming though your kitchen as the water boils. The light metal does not retain any heat. So your water cools just as quickly as it heats up. It's easy to clean and looks OK sitting on the stovetop. It would be a decent gift for someone at a reasonable price.
4,topsy teakettle,"This product is beautifully designed. It performs well except for the lid, which plops into everything I cook."
5,Tea Time,"For only $12 I have no complaints except for when it is done and the whistle is blowing, it is sometimes hard to pull the whistle out on a hot pot. Other than that I would purchase one again, not too flimsy or anything."
5,True Blue,"Every serious team sportsman should read this book. You will not be able to put it down. It is tremendously motivating and a moving story about self belief, hard work, and reward."
2,One sided but useful to those who know the sport and events.,"The only good thing about this book is that it represents the views of one of the participants of the events in question. It is written from a disturbingly biased view and, at best, may represent a shift to modern training methods from the old traditional ways of training. I did find the ""politics"" of Oxford rowing interesting. It is too bad that we have no way of judging the veracidy of the author."
1,Dull Dull Dull,"No-one has managed to make the sport of rowing interesting and the film made it look like a petty sport. The whole story about Dan's way or the the high-way comes clean here. The book is a bit more of a ripping yarn, but if you are a true officianado then you should read Alison Gill's book ""Yanks at Oxford"" as all the facts a clearly here to be seen.Dan dusts over the facts and this does the sport of rowing a dis-service.I pray for the day when we have a real book which underlines our passion for the sport.God Save the queen and the Jolly sport of rowing."
5,NORTH OF PATAGONIA by Johnny Payne,"A great read! In this masterfully woven novel, Johnny Payne brings his engaging protagonist into 3-dimensional life in a variety of settings that I found surprisingly fascinating, including the worlds of boxing and horse racing. We encounter rich diversity of characters here as well, including an ex-wife who is writing a novel as we read, using the life of the protagonist as her subject. The plot of North of Patagonia is satisfyingly complex, and the reading is easy. I couldn't put the book down."
5,durangomom,"I got 2 of these for my kid's, and they are made very well, they keep nthe lunch cold for a while, w/out a cold pack. they have neet disigns, know one else in my kids classes have these lunch boxs, so get to have somthing a little differnt from the average walmart box, I highly recommend these and they are well worth paying extra for."
3,Cute but hard to clean,My 4 year old daughter has been using this lunchbox for 6 months. She is pretty messy and the seams in the lunchbox are difficult to clean. It also stains if you use too much water to clean it. Other than that it is a cute lunchbox and fits everything in it- even a small thermos for soup.
5,Attractive and durable,"My 6YO daughter loves this lunchbox. The graphics are very cute with all the horse breed names on the sides. The exterior zipper pocket is handy for coins and HandiWipes. The interior is large and will accommodate aZiploc Divided Container, Rectangle 2 eaalong with a frozen cold pack. I only wish it had a loop or an interior pocket for utensils, but no biggie. The seams can get a little dirty, but I wipe ours out with a damp washcloth and a little white vinegar to help with stains and remove odors. And yep, style points. No one else in our classroom has that design lunchbox, either. Seems to help start some friendly conversations in the lunch room!UPDATE: We've used this lunchbox every schoolday for three years, and still going strong! Just turn it inside out to give it a thorough washing with dishsoap in the sink. Great product!! Second daughter is about to start using her ballerina girl lunchbox. Thanks for dollars well spent!! :0)"
5,Great lunchbox,"Purchased for 5 1/2 year old daughter. She loves it. Has main compartment, zipper front and a mesh compartment on back. Two zippers for main compartment which is handy. Roomy and durable. Great color scheme too. Would highly recommend. Our daughter loves horses and this one has all different types with their names written on the lunchbox in two areas."
4,Mops - 'Rock & Roll 1970' (EMI Japan),"How many 'actual' / proper lp's did The Mops originally put out? My guess is three. Anyway, I like what I'm hearing here on 'Rock & Roll 1970' with it's twelve powerful heavy-hitting tracks by this must-experience Japanese four-piece. Liked their medley of ""Rock 'N Roll - Good Golly Miss Molly - Long Tall Sally"", their total ass-kicking ""Kyoko"", their Beatles cover ""Eleanor Rigby"", ""Get, Got, Gotten"" and ""Club A Go-Go"". Essential listening."
4,The Thin Blue Line,"This is a documentary of a 1976 cop-killing in Dallas, in which all the evidence, at least the way it's presented here by director/writer Errol Morris, indicates the wrong man was convicted. The whole movie consists of interviews with witnesses and those involved with the case, with the camera used to show and reshow various scenes as they are recounted. Good as far as it goes, with much concern over motives of witnesses and their revelation of ""truth"" - but seriously lacking in drama. Philip Glass wrote the music, which is haunting. Worth a watch."
3,"great documentary, average transfer","no doubt this is a great documentary, and i agree with the other reviews, but MGM did yet another average print and packaging job. the print looks no different than the vhs version. no booklet inside. no commentaries. forth, i wish they would of put the follow-up half-hour documentary on this dvd. errol morris talks about how this originally was suppose to be a documentary on ""doctor death"", but after interviewing david harris, he realized randal adams was innocent. it was American Playhouse episode hosted by bill moyers. that would of been a perfect combination for this package. instead, we get a short on the nature of evil, which isn't bad at all. this dvd package could of been a lot, lot better."
1,Nothing in it that I could detect,"I've tried a lot of pheromone products, so I know I can smell pheromones. This one doesn't have any smell at all except for the alcohol.I tried wearing it anyway a few times, put on quite a lot, and got zero reaction from anyone.I think it's so unscented that there's nothing in it."
4,super resource for writers,"I would rank this book just behind Victorian Fashions and Costumes from Harper's Bazar, 1867-1898 (Dover Pictorial Archives) by Stella Blum and Full-Color Victorian Fashions : 1870-1893 by JoAnne Olian. If you have to be selected go with the first two before this one, but I still highly recommend this to round out the collection. More than 900 very detailed crisp drawing from the marvelous people at Dover Publishing again. They bring you inexpensive books that are a wealth of information, writers of period romance just cannot live without."
4,Success!,Thank you for the great service and the book that I bought to show the reenactors at our 1890s Victorian Village what their costumes should look like.

3,love cd2 for massage!,"I bought this CD to play during massage. It's actually a two-disc set. Unfortunately, more than 1/2 the songs are almost an indian-pop, too lively and loud for massage. the 2nd cd, however, is just four long songs, beautiful and melodic. A very nice change-of-pace from the bland massage-specific music I normally end up playing."
3,Not bad.,"This was a fairly entertaining story with lots of plot twists and red herrings. The plotline was overly complicated with suspicion cast on pretty much everyone in the book at some point. The heroine is unfortunately a whiny, self-centered drama queen and her tough, practical best friend would seem to be the more appropriate main character! And it's easy to see what's important in the author/actress' personal life, what with all the brand-name dropping throughout the book. The action got underway in the first chapter of the book, which I always appreciate, and continued throughout the story. Good beach reading!"
2,As bad as it's predecessor,"To be honest, I borrowed this book from a public library because the bad experience from its precedessor The Innergame of Trading had deterred me from wasting my hard earned money on this.For detailed review please see my review of the Innergame of Trading because the two books are so similar, of very low value and repeating the same basic trading psychology stuff like a successful trader got to have discipline, focus, bravery to cut loss short and let profit ride blah blah blah, except that the interview part in Outer is about 100 page longer than that in Inner. (160 vs 60) However, the quality of the interview content is even lower.I really cannot agree what the authors claimed on the book cover that their book helped the readers to model the trading strategies of Today's Market Wizards. How? Just by going through the lines of the interview. I am afraid that's more diffcult than achieving a 6 month winning streak."
2,Doesn't grind well,"I've owned this grinder for about 6 months, it never has ground well - the peppercorns get stuck inside and don't find their way easily to the grinder. I bought this one because I couldn't bring myself to spend [$$$] to get the ""real"" grinder that this one imitates.To get the pepper to grind I constantly have to shake and tap on the side of the grinder. I've tried different adjustments of the grind, different types of peppercorns, tried overpacking the pepper, and underpacking it, all with the same result.I'm looking for a better one now, came across this one and thought I'd pass on my experience. My advice - pass on this one for a better one."
3,"Fairly good, but complex, system","A few days ago I tried to install this GPS. After around an hour I got the 125 MB software installed and the GPS working somewhat, but the signal wasn't too good. The GPS has no attenna, so I had to move it around in the car to give it a decent signal. Even when I was holding it in the air near the back of the vehicle it still freqently lost it's signal from the satelites for a second or so. It did plot the trip well, but you only see the streets if you insert the eastern or western US cdrom.Although the compass feature seemed okay, the odometer had a lag of around 4 seconds and seemed to show the speed as being 5 - 10 mph under what it really was.Overall, this is a decent product. The installation is complex, the software difficult to learn, but it's pretty cheap and seems to plot the trip well."
5,Seasons at Seven Gates Farm,"I have owned this book for many years and misplaced it. It is the Bible of Primitive home in all seasons. It is a reference of how to make an inviting style to a farmhouse or any dwelling. Jimmy and Dean are mega talented, clearly the path makers for the rest of us to come. Clearly they had a vision.We moved to an old family farmhouse, and in the move apparently my original rag earred book got misplaced. Looking everywhere, I finally decided to buy another one.I LOVE this book! While my favorite season of the book, but not MY favorite season, is the winter pages. But then it would be hard to define any real page or season that would stand out. They all do. It is a great style book. It is a great reference book. It is surely entertainment. It is my favorite book of all time.I highly recommend it."
5,COUNTRY LIVING SEASONS AT SEVEN GATES FARM,"IF YOU LOVE PRIMITIVES THIS BOOK IS A MUST HAVE. ITS FULL OF GREAT PICTURES ALL DONE ACCORDING TO EACH SEASON ON THE SEVEN GATES FARM.I FOUND MY FIRST COPY IN A LITTLE PRIMITIVE SHOP, AND SINCE THEN I HAVE BOUGHT SEVERAL COPIES FOR OTHERS EVERYONE AGREES ITS A FUN BOOK. SEE FOR YOURSELF,BUY ONE SIT BACK AND ENJOY!"
5,STUNNING,OMG!!!! I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS WATCH!!! IT IS SO ME!!! IT IS STUNNINGLY BEAUTIFUL. I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD OR WOULD FIND A FEMININE WATCH!!!!!!! THEY ARE ALL SO CLUNKY AND HUGE LIKE A MANS. UGH!!!!!!!!!!! i CAN'T WAIT UNTIL i CAN AFFORD THE GOLD ONE. BUT FOR NOW I THING THIS IS PRETTY HARD TO OUT-DO. FAST FAST FAST SHIPPING!!!!!! iT WAS INCREDIBLE HOW FAST IT GOT HERE
1,will never order from this company again...,I will never place an order with this company again. They shipped out the wrong item. When I called customer service they were friendly but not great on following up. They recalled the coat rack promptly but failed to give an estimate on when the lamp would arrive and had no tracking information. The lamp finally arrived 3-4 weeks after placing the order. It arrived in a partially opened dammaged box without the original packing slip.
2,Not Vista Ultimate Compatible,"I did a Google search for Vista compatible head phone sets because my Logitech wouldn't work when I purchased my new computer, pre-loaded with Home Premium--The Jabra came up on Amazon's site so I purchased it. It worked fine on Home Premium but after I used the CD upgrade to Vista Ultimate, it stopped working. So did my speakers that came with the computer.Microsoft finally got my speakers working but not the head set--I called Jabra and someone was suppose to get back to me--that was two weeks ago--I'd like to know how to get this working--where are the drivers for it? I think I am going to have to return it to Amazon and find a head set that works which is a real bummer because when this set worked it was AWESOME! :(("
5,My son,"I purchased this book for my 14 year old son. Not many books out there target the young African American male, but this books is a great start. I think all young and old, men and women need to have a book such as this for future references."
1,Looks better than it is,"My daughter asked for this for Christmas and the picture online made it appear to be a solid, streamlined, easy to use system. It was a big disappointment. It never did fit properly and easily on the Ipod, it was hard to attach to the band. In short, we never did really figure it out or get it to work, and in the end just pitched it and stuck with a silicone case. I'd give it a zero if I could"
1,A impostor at work,"I personally know the author. He is NOT a physicist. This book was (badly) written in the typical fashion of charlatans. His information about the pyramids is directly taken from Piazzi Smythe, whose views where discounted over 100 years ago.This, combined with every conspiracy-theory ever known makes this book dis-jointed and ridiculous. If you have any grey-matter at all, you will avoid this book."
4,Best brand of cough drops,"These are the best brand of cough drops I have found. The different flavors are good, and without the terrible icky sweet aftertaste of most cough lozenges. While not any longer acting than other brands, I have found them to be effective and actually work!! My only complaint is that they are difficult to find, and not always stocked at the local grocery or pharmacy. Online ordering seems to be the way to go. One more complaint. Why did this company quit manufacturing the ""frosted"" brand of drops? They were excellent, but are now no longer available."
5,Highly recommended,"I found this book to be extremely helpful both personally and professionally. It is written clearly so that busy people, such as myself, can use the technique easily. It is down to earth and basic and at the same time explains in a readable fashion, how and why this method works. I am a psychotherapist and teacher and have taught the technique to students and clients, both adult and children. But most of all, I use it on myself often. It has helped me to cut down on my obsession with chocolate. It has helped reduce pain in my back. It has helped me feel much better over a loss I recently suffered. I could go on and on. It almost seems to easy and simple to be true--but it really does work!!"
3,What am I doing wrong?,"I really wanted tapping to work for me. I've read through the book several times, trying to make sure I do it right. The problem is that it doesn't seem to be working for me. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. The book was well written but I can't give it any more than 3 stars."
5,A Miracle,"Wonderfully helpful book. I really didn't expect it to work, but it immediately relieved some pain and anxiety that I had been struggling with for 2 months. It's been over a week and it hasn't come back. Thank you!"
4,interesting,"I like all these self help books, but to see concrete examples of someone in need and how she survived, I would also suggest the book MY LAST REMAINS by Jill (also on amazon)"
4,A very useful read,"As a mindfulness based psychotherapist, author and teacher, I found the advice in this book to be very helpful. I find that when such good strategies as presented here are combined with mindfulness meditation, which provides a way of of establishing a healthy, non-reactive inner therapeutic space in which difficult emotions, depression, anxiety and trauma can heal. If you would like to couple this sound advice with the healing power of mindfulness, then I also recommend 'The Path of Mindfulness Meditation' by Dr Peter Strong, an in-depth exploration of mindfulness meditation."
1,Better name would be Clipping your Horse for Halter,Don't waste your money. This video covers clipping your horse for show. It includes how to black their feet and how to spray commercial hair products on. No discussion on how to actually groom one (you have to buy another video to get that) or how to actually FIT one to get it into shape to show. Nor is there any demos on how to actually show a horse at halter or what the judge would be looking for. Unbelieveable. I fell into the ... trap way too easy.
5,No matter what people may say...,"...this is TBG's best album by far. Production values are high and every song is perfect. Listeners who aren't used to Japanese or Jpop music may feel a little left out of the loop, but most likely they'll simply overlook it since the music makes up for it 10 times fold. I don't listen to American music anymore because most of it is crap these days, and The Brilliant Green is one of my favorite Jpop/Jrock groups. This album adds dirty grunge to their previous fluffy sound. The most worthy CD yet."
3,It's a quickie,"I read this book several years ago. It is cute in some places, serious in others. Molly is very earnest in her work, which is where she meets Brian. Brian is trying to figure out his new life. It's a short book, however, and never really gets fleshed out. It's a pleasant afternoon read, but leaves you wanting more."
2,Incorrect book sent,"I ordered the book described on the right side of this review submissin page. The book that I purchased was titled The Last Tycoon, An unfinished Novel, Together with the Great Gatsby and Selected stories. The book that I received was the Last Tycoon, without the Great Gatsby or the additional Selected stories. That is the reason for my negative review. I was contacted by the seller once before and asked to change the review to one more positive but was not offered any resolution for the fact that an error was made and the wrong book was delivered. Please do not ask me to continually review the same purchased ona repeated basis. Thank you.Sincerely,Marcel Tourdot"
3,I WOULD GIVE IT FIVE STARS IF IT WERE NOT...,"... if it were not for the man (Alexander Stille I presume) who keeps walking in and out of the screen when you least expect it. He wrote the book, that is fine! but does he have to spoil the landscape too? I find him extremely irritating."
5,Best Management How To Book,"Best how-to manage better book I've ever read. No fluff, no unproven theories. Written by a man who has actually done it. Managers at all levels and in all types of businesses can benefit from this book. Buy it now before it goes out of print again."
3,Not the best catch...,"I read this book and I thought it was completely average. Of course, it was kind of cute and funny at times, but mostly it was boring. This book did not leave a strong impression on me, nor would I recommend it to all of my friends. This book is appropriate for younger junior high students who would like a taste of what teenage-hood is about."
3,"Funny, but not as good as the I Hate to Cook Book","Typical of Bracken's charm and wit, this book is a good read. After the first perusal, though, it's one that's stayed on my shelf untouched. Compared to her ""I Hate to Cook Book"" or ""I Hate to Houseclean,"" which I've enjoyed several times, this one just isn't as engaging for me. If you're new to Bracken, start with the cook book, instead."
3,Have not noticed much change,"I have not noticed any positive effects. Truthfully, I have not taken this product on a regular basis. So, my very sporadic use of this supplement has not had any noticeable effects. This does not mean it will not help you, especially if you faithfully take it.Why did I write this review. I was tired of Amazon pestering me to review it."
1,This is not for INTERNATIONAL use,"I was looking for a replacement for my present 120/220 volt immersion heater. Not familiar with this brand name I assumed it was for international use. Nope, works at only 120V. Conveniently misleading name. Seems to be the regular ""Made in China"" quality you'd find in any store selling cheap imported junk, and would cost about $3."
2,Poor Quality,"I bought 2 of this. One turned into a yucky purple/blue color after only two uses, the other broke in less than 6 months. I don't recommend it to anyone."
3,LOTS OF PHOTOGRAPHS BUT NOT THE BEST QUALITY,"First of all let me say that any tribute to the horrific events of September 11th is an honourable and well-deserved recognition. One never truly understands the endless compassion and devotion towards humanity until we witness those who went beyond the line of duty and gave their lives to save others. The stories of bravery and heroism show us a side of human nature that on a day-to-day basis one does not always see. However, there are other books on the market that I would choose for a keepsake before this one. This is essentially a book of photographs and the quality of black and white photgraphs does not do the book justice. If the reader is looking for a keepsake to pass on to future generations, I would recommend ""One Nation: America Remembers September 11, 2001"". That book not only contains photographs...it tells a story."
1,Shameless PROFITEERING from 9/11 Tragedy!,"By now -- March 16, 2005 -- this book has been revealed as a sleazy bit of profiteering by the shameless BERNARD KERIK. KERIK was conducting an extra-marital affair with JUDITH REGAN, publisher of this book, in an apartment overlooking the smoldering ashes of the World Trade Center. (The apartment was INTENDED to be used for rest and recuperation by exhausted rescue workers from Ground Zero!) KERIK's ""r&r;"" in the apartment included ""negotiating"" a deal with his mistress and publisher (JUDITH REGAN) in which she paid KERIK $75,954.52 for writing an introduction to this book. KERIK's introduction is just eleven sentences long, so KERIK got nearly $7000 per sentence!Please don't believe REGAN BOOKS' claim that ""Publisher's profits will be donated to the New York Police & Fire Widows' & Children's Benefit Fund."" If you buy a copy of this book, you will just be contributing to the ""r&r;"" fund of Bernard Kerik, a disgraced buffoon."
1,All you need to know about this vid......,"Using ""of"" as a verb is all you need to know about the intelligence behind the production, marketing and manufacturing of this video. I'm surprised they didn't use ""road"" as a verb, too."
4,great teaching tool,Great way to teach your children financial responsiblity. But the first thing my sons did was to save enough money to buy a wallet and get rid of the envelopes. They love the commission chart and enjoy payday.
2,Did not meet Expectations,"Overpriced for what we purchased. Teaching kids about money is very important and while this product may spark that interest (temporarily), there was not a whole lot to it. Very cheap materials for what we paid. I suppose it did provide a good lesson about buying over the internet because you are taking a risk when you can't see what you are actually buying. Hopefully the kids learned that or more."
2,Needs more information,Most of these things you can create yourself. I was looking for suggestions of chores for each age group and there are no guidelines in this packet.
1,These prices are crazy!,Shame on me for not doing more homework. I usually assume that I can find the best price on most anything on amazon. Not the case with this product. I paid $73.00 for something I could have paid $19.99 at the authors website. My kids are really excited about the product and we're definitely going to use it.
4,Teaching daughter about money.,"My wife and I were concerned about teaching our children to be responsible and understand money. We were unable to find a satisfactory book or sytem until we used this tool. Our four year old has been using the system layed out in this pack, and she thinks it's COOL."
2,I agree with the above review...,"At the onset, the book looks chock-full of great, easy recipes for those working on yeast problems. But to actually make the recipes...I wonder if the authors actually tried them out. Ugh! Maybe their tastebuds are messed up. There are comments such as ""Delicious! Satisfying!"" Don't think so. Some tasteless things, and one of the breads didn't turn out like it was supposed to...what a mess...and the ingredients were expensive! Even though the directions were followed to a ""t"", it didn't work. But our dogs enjoyed it. The section about veggies and how to select the right ones was nice. If you are just starting a yeast-free program, be careful...some of these foods you can't have early in the yeast-free eating process. Some what worthwhile as a reference guide. Just keep an open mind that some dishes won't taste the way you would expect them to."
4,Good Resource,"Found very helpful when my doctor suggested I cut out refined sugars, vinegars and simple carbohydrates in order to help recover from a yeast allergy. While I have not stayed as strict as The Yeast Connection diet suggests, it really helped the first month I needed to cut back."
4,Worked well,This book worked well for me when I first discovered I was yeast intolerant. I would highly recommend it for anyone who is having difficulty in finding out how to eat with this difficulty. There are lots of gluten intolerant books out there but not many for the yeast intolerance.
4,yeast-friend or foe?,interesting material presented in understandable way. helpful info to let one decide if the banning yeast in their diet would be beneficial.
5,Great for Cooking Recipes,Arrived eariler than expected. Full of useful information when someone is unsure how to cook for the Candida Diet. I would definitly recommend getting this along side of the Yeast Connection book.
4,Very good but needs some work,"Changeling is one of the most innovative rpg`s I have ever seen. But as in most of the White Wolf games the organization of the book is terrible you have to flip over pages to find the exact thing that you are looking for, but after some time you can get used to the book. The idea of playing faeries in world of darkness is a most challenging and enjoyable one. And the way that WW puts the elements of traditional faerie tales into their gloomy world is very successful. (`a faerie dies when someone sayas that she oes not believe in faeries` makes sense in the changeling the dreaming) If you are tired of dungeons and dragons style of fantasy and if you are not obsessively inlove with the darkness of vampire the masquarade, changeling is a good rpg for you. For those who think that changeling is not going along well with the other world of darkness games, because it is too ""light"" should consider that nothing can be more frightening or more beautiful than our dreams."
5,Hope for the World of Darkness,"Angst is nice, but face it, do you really need Jyhad politics and the Technocracy and god knows what all of the major antagonists in the White Wolf games shoving it down your throat? Changeling is a bit 'lighter' than that, and it's rather refreshing to have a character with some hope. I reccomend this to anyone. Even the players who want to bemoan their existance need but play sluagh."
3,Changeling the Dreaming the players guide,"It was very helpfull in making, the charchter i was trying to create. Also it gave basic information on what kind of charchter you would be playing. It was great, i think changeling is the best of all white wolf games."
3,disappointing,"I have only given this book a score of average because, despite the fact it may merit more if it stands alone, it cannot compare to the pure style and playability of vampire or werewolf. i have been playing this game for nearly 6 months now, and i just do not find it to be as stimulating as it's predecessors. maybe i just cannot appreciate the lighthearted nature of the game, but in my opinion the white wolf team need to concentrate on the darker aspects of their game, it seems to be what they are best at."
3,Confusing and noncompatible,"I'll basically put it like this, I have found that Changeling is a great game but it lacks in compatiblility with over White Wolf games. Also the rules could have been written a bit better in order to aviod confusion, so far rules for Banality are the most confusing rules I have come across in any RPG"
5,Excellent resource to share with others.,"After meeting Maureen Rank several years ago and finding her to be an incredibly down-to-earth woman and very sensitive and caring regarding this subject, I have shared this book with several friends who have struggled with miscarriage or stillbirth. All reported that this book was significantly helpful and important to them in their grieving and healing process. In addition, those friends now share this book with their friends who are grieving. Thank you, Maureen Rank, for writing this book to encourage men and women who grieve from the loss of their children. You have helped so many people."
4,Better than most,I got a couple of cutting boards at one time and this one seems to be the best for fitting on the sink. My only complaint is that it is hard to store. There is no way to keep the bowl attached when it is in the cabinet or drawer. It does however stay on the sink very well.
4,a little small,"the board is great, and i like the fact that it wont dull my good knives, but the legs could be a little bit longer. it just fits my sink width wise, so i generally use it length wise. it would be nice to have a bit more cutting space as well"
5,#1 book on LIMOGES! A MUST for all Limoges collectors!,"Collecting Hand Painted Limoges Porcelain Boxes to Vases, Antique Limoges at HOme and Living With Limoges, DuBay's trilogy on collecting Limoges - are a must for all interested in Limoges, the art of hand painted Limoges, Limoges as an art and collecting Limoges. Fantastic books; all marks, backstamps, historical information, fabulous photos, and well written and gifted author. A MUST!"
5,5 hankie book,"If you are a dog lover, I recommend you buy this book. I also recommend you read it in private so you can cry in peace. It is a beautifully written account of the last day of a Golden Retriever who's family is giving him one special day before he must take one last trip to the vet. Written from the perspective of Jasper's ""boy"", it is heart warming and realistic in dealing with the pain of losing a beloved dog."
5,a good book for the subject,We got this book to help prepare our 3 years old when our dog was diagnosed with heart failure. I looked over a lot of books and this was one of the best i thought. I also liked saying goodbye to LuLu.
4,Just as awesome live as on this recording....,"I saw them live last February with Type O, and they blew me away. I bought the cd less than two days later. It did not disappoint. Even though I love hardcore metal, one of my favorite tracks is Sweet Oblivion, which is a little less intense. I highly recommend all of the tracks, though. Especially if you have some adrenaline to burn."
2,no way,these guys are nothing like our lady peace or finger eleven....Finger eleven doesn't scream at the top of their lungs so you can't hear what they are saying..Finger eleven is 100 times better than these guys and have more talent...sorry
3,"Good, but nothing new","I heard this band before when they were called Suction and I thought they were pretty cool. This cd however is kind of a disappointment. In most regards it's pretty heavy, more hard rock music rather than groovecore and the vocals are all right ranging from a kind of nasal, feminine voice during the slow parts and then the typical screaming and hardcore singing during the chorus. There aren't any really standout tracks though I do like ""Junk"" and ""Foolish Pride"". Overall the band doesn't do anything I haven't heard before and if I would have to describe them I'd say they are like Our Lady Peace or Smashing Pumpkins with a little Coal Chamber mixed in with it (very little). So if you're into that kind of music then check them out and check out Finger Eleven."
5,Short lives,This Cd is a must have. Too bad they are no longer around! Words cannot describe how great it is. Buy it before its no more...
3,Doesn't Dazzle,"I think they should have remastered the original two greatest hits collections, not to mention all the albums, rather than picking and choosing for a new collection. I have every CD and they are in bad need of remastering (low volume production on all). As much as I love them, they seem to be trying to get yuppies to enjoy their music by making a rather radio friendly ""Greatest Hits"" collection. I still think Hyena is their best album with the amazing Dazzle & Swimming Horses. Where is the b-side collection all us fans are waiting for? They speak so much about them in the Biography but they haven't surfaced since 45's were made. Hell, I love them so much I forgive them. They still put on an amazing show."
1,30 years ahead of her time...thoroughly awful!,"An amazingly prophetic artist. Siouxsie's work was 30 years ahead of its time so that, if you were told this is the latest thing since Lady Gaga, even despite the more minimal electronics, you would not bat an eye. Now, that is astounding given how much music has changed. The new stuff now from Gaga is barely as mindless, coarse, simplistic and tuneless as Siouxsie's stuff back then. She had it all!"
3,The Best? partly correct,"Can't really be the best without Fear (of the Unknown) and the classic DAZZLE.Skating bullets on angel dust in a dead sea of fluid mercury, baby piano cries under your heavy index and thumb. Pull some strings let them sing."
3,This has all been done before,"I would give this CD 5 stars because the songs on here are indeed brilliant but given the fact that nearly all of these songs have already been released on the compilations ""Once upon a time"" and ""Twice upon a time"" and are not necessarily their best - but just selected singles, I can only give this 3 stars. Siouxsie's songs were pure genius back in her 80's heyday. ""Happy House"", ""Christine"" and ""Spellbound"" are absolute classics and still stand the test of time.I think her hardcore fans are still wanting more than just the repackaged singles. The b-sides and more obscure album tracks on a compilation would have been far more interesting."
4,A must own CD,This CD is something you absolutely must own.Some of the best music I've heard from the 1980s and not dated at all. Though my attempts to share Siouxsie with my friends have been less successful.
1,Redundant and Misrepresentative,"Few groups with can lay claim to a musical legacy as varied and richly textured as Siouxsie and the Banshees. This hit-oriented retrospective ignores the group's roots in punk and barely hints at the breadth and power of the Banshees' repertoire; 11 of the 15 tracks were previously compiled on ONCE UPON A TIME and TWICE UPON A TIME. Intended as bait for completists, the new track ""Dizzy"" is an alternate version of a single sold on 2002's ""Seven Year Itch"" tour. The perky 1978 UK hit ""Hong Kong Garden"" is the only evidence of the McKay/Morris lineup. Sparkling sound quality underscores the bounty a remastered back catalog could yield; dozens of rare B-sides await reincarnation as bonus tracks. This CD would be a poor introduction to newcomers, and an unnecessary redundancy for fans."
4,The best is still to come,"Yes, this is only a ""commercial"" best of, but a necessary evil in these days of corporate greed. I highly recommend this CD to anyone interested in the legacy of the Banshees. The bonus CD (specially ""Song from the edge of the world"") is a nice thank-you from the band to the fans. Hopefully this Best Of will trigger the Bsides compilation and/or a box set. Keep those black-eyes peeled!"
5,Right in the sweet spot!,"This topic is clearly right in Mr. Bijaoui's sweet spot and he delivers with a home run. If you are looking to build a big, honkin' server, but also want to know all of the gotchas along the way, this book is for you.Just what I was looking for..."
4,Nice CD. Needs a better title,"This CD provides a nice sampling over a broad stylistic swath of the 20th century.The only overarching theme seems to be that these are pieces that Peter Serkin likes to play. That's a lucky thing for the listener. These are excellent pieces and their performance indicates yet again that the Serkin genome has expressed itself nobly for another generation. None of the pieces is lengthy: in that regard the novice listener can explore new music without overextending. The experienced listener will enjoy it even more. There are some gems in here, including a languid(!) piece by Wuorinen, a dandy Toccato by Wolpe, lovely Takemitsu, aggressive Messiaen and much more. The playing is precise and impassioned. The recording is clear and intimate. It's a keeper."
2,The Ocean that has no West and no East,"Dear Sir or Madam,I have had some difficulty in enjoying this CD. However, it must be good to use the right half of our brain, which is usually not used."
3,not the same as before,It covers well but no where like several years ago. I cant for the life of me see why a company changes a formula that was so good.
4,Works nicely.,I have used it and love it. My face feels much better so I'm sure I look better. The product works well for me.
2,Bought game for gift -,Bought game as a gift for 9 year old son. Game came in a disc. No cover. Can barely read what the disc says. Looks VERY generic.......
3,"Good, but not too good",This game is pretty cool because you have to manage money and get skaters to come. When it comes to the actual skating around your park it is bad. The tricks are limeted and you have to learn yoga to link them together. If you want a game just to build this is fine but if you want to actually skate by a tony hawk pro skater ( underground is coming out and thats really cool).
5,A lot of rhyming fun,"""A Huge Hog Is a Big Pig,"" by Francis McCall and Patricia Keeler, is an enjoyable book. Each 2-page spread contains a riddle for which you have to guess a two-word rhyming response; when you turn the page, you have the answer. Examples: ""A huge hog is a. . . BIG PIG."" ""A silly rabbit is a . . . FUNNY BUNNY."" The book, which is set on a farm, is illustrated throughout with entertaining pictures of children and farm animals. Overall, a book with a lot of likeable energy."
5,A Ton of Fun (For Everyone!),"This book is sure to be a 'rave fave' with hip tykes of all stripes.If you're looking for an interactive, playful book for kids, THIS IS IT! Kids & adults will have great fun reading it together. My kids were truly engaged by trying to guess the answers to the clues and couldn't wait to get to the next page. (Even grown-ups will get into the game!)Plus, 'A Huge Hog' features a diverse cast of cute kids & animals in bold, eye-catching photographs. The bright layout is the perfect compliment to the witty word game.I can guarantee that you'll want to keep on playing even when you're done reading!"
3,better for reading to a class,"This book, I think, would be better for a storytime or a class because my daughter didn't get a lot of the riddles. (I know that sounds pathetic, but it's true.) If you have a group of kids, it will increase your chances that at least one of the kids will ""get it,"" and then he/she can explain the joke to the other kids."
4,This video is good for anyone interested in the Martial Arts,"This video is phenomenal for anyone who wishes to get a nice jump-start into the world of Martial Arts. Austin St. John not only shows several moves, et cetera, but he also interacts with both the students in his class on the screen and at home.The video does not claim it will make you a Karate Master, but it does give you a nice foundation and encourages anyone further interested in the martial arts to seek out an instructor or school. This video is great for anyone of any age, child or otherwise, who thinks they might like to take up Martial Arts. Plus, for those who are Austin St. John fans due to his role on Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, there is an added bonus of a brief cameo by his Ranger co-stars Thuy Trang and Walter Jones. END"
4,Great all-around stick,"I have used the Wingman force feedback joystick and this stick and, for the money, I'll take this stick anyday.The handle fits my hand well. The overall feel is one of durability yet fluid movement. The return to center is quick and strong. The button location is good overall, but the hat switch could be better designed. A minor point, but your finger can slip off the switch during fast gameplay, due to its shallow, somewhat slick design.One feature I really like is the handle twist. Really nice for rudder movement on flight sims and good for looking from side-to-side in first person shooters.Add to this the great trigger response and cool base design and you have a winning package."
5,Followup review,"I wanted to do a quick followup review of this stick. My first impressions were quite good. The stick had all the buttons I wanted. Throttle and rudder controls. It worked great. Looked great. That was 2001...how time flies! But I still have this same stick and I've used the heck out of it. So how does it work in 2003 (almost 2004)? Well, just exactly how it did when I first bought it. Amazing stick!"
2,OK choice,"It is an OK joystick - rather cheep, user friendly and easy to install. However, I had it only for about 3 months and already have some quality and precision problems. It is also not very ergonomic - you have to have loooong fingers to operate it comfortably and the stick is slippery. I strongly recommend similarly priced joysticks from ThrustMaster. They are great joysticks and many of them have a stick covered with rubber - very convenient, fits like a glove!"
4,Good for some time.....,"The bright side: the stick itself was a snap to install under XP, the buttons are laid out in a very ergonomic pattern, making 5 buttons(4 fire buttons and one hat) accessible by just sweeping the thumb. The throttle is also good, and the stick centers precisly.Now the dark side: like the other reviewers noted, the stick has problems with the twist rudder. However in my case, it started about 1 1/2 years after I bought it(I've had it for 2 years now), probably because I never used the twist rudder. Then it started twithcing, making it hard to control. Another con, is the lack of buttons. There are eight, but when you try to play such games as Janes F/A-18, there are simply nnoot enough buttons.I hope this helped you a little"
5,Excellent Stick,"I just got this joystick from circuit city and all I had to do was put the installation CD in, plug in the joystick, and it works great. I am running windows XP, and had no problems at all installing this, unlike some other joysticks.I use this stick mostly for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002, and it works great with it. Flying, landing, taking off, everything works well. The stick is definetly worth the price."
4,Agree with Lars,"The fix posted by Lars actually worked. If you have an extra two hours to take the stick apart (he may have done it quicker), you can soak the pods in alcohol and get a fairly decent result. Mine works quite fine after following his advice. Hardest part, as usual, was getting it back together- very frustrating. But for the price, if you really like this controller, buy another one."
3,Good but after a while u need a better joystick,"i had this joystick for about 3 years now. ive been playin janes f-15 and mircosoft flight simulator 2002. when i was playin FS2002 i found out that it had a slight problem, it wouldnt center when i was trying to take off it would go off the runway and continue goin left, the only way u would be able to center it is when u constantly apply right force to equal the left. after a while of doing this my wrists would hurt from the pain. so in the end i juss bought the logictech wingman attack 2 for around 18 bucks on this site and so far everything looks good. i think the wingman attack 2 is a better deal, it has the same feel as the extreme 3d the only exception is that the extreme 3d has more buttons! thats it other than that same performance!"
2,Second One to break....,"This is the second Logitech WingMan Extreme Digital 3D Joystick that I have owned. The first lasted over a year and then some of the wires inside just snapped (opened it up after failure of some buttons). Looks like they used very brittle thin wires in the construction. However, over a year with my 4yo using it wasn't too bad so I replaced it with another in June. It just failed after 4 months. While the feel of it was great, it's reliability is a serious drawback. No caibration issues here."
2,rudder-twist defect,"Just like another reviewer, my rudder-twist function has become ""jumpy"" and ruins any flights. On the calibration screen, the rudder/twist needle jumps all across the scale when it is not being touched. When I look at the airplane I am trying to fly when it is parked and no engine running, I am amazed to see the rudder of the aircraft is actually deflecting back and forth! No wonder the aircraft is difficult to fly.This problem became noticable after only 6 months of owning this stick, which was stable when it was brand new. The price for this stick does not look so great when you will only get 6 to 8 months out of it!"
5,Terrific Topic!,"In a day and age when we are inundated with stories of angels, it is refreshing to see a book that deals with the topic in a scriptural and thorough manner. I'm arming myself with answers for when my child begins asking. :)"
5,"EASY, COLORFUL AND QUICK - I LOVE IT!","Rosemary Wilkinson's title for this book says it all: Quick, colorful, fast and easy! Just the ticket for the busy quilter who needs to break free after having finished a difficult and complicated quilt and who just wants to zip together a fabby quilt that requires not much thinking, just color intuition, a bursting stash of fabrics calling out to be utilized and a few hours of time. Presto! I love this book! Thanks, Rosemary!"
4,awesome sound,The needle slipped right into place and played beautifully. Needles were shipped when they said and got here in time for Christmas.
3,Decent debut,"I did not realize that this was Kathryn Smith's first novel; as such, it's very good indeed. It does have its problems, however. Chief among them is the trust issue; its rehashing got quite old. The truth behind the murders is not wholly believable. Varya's worries about Ivan prove fruitless, and therefore a waste of time. But the chemistry between Miles & Varya is credible, and there are a number of very nice scenes. For some reason I have yet to understand, I rarely like romances set in Russia, but the Russian scenes here are enjoyable. The ones of the ship may be some of the best. Smith defintely shows talent here that will be more fully realized in other books where Miles & Varya figure as secondary characters. That makes it nice to know their story."
1,"Terrible product, don't waste your money","I bought this machine with hopes that I could make hats and cocoons for babies. The plastic hooks are cheap, some don't come up and grab the yarn and leave holes in the project. What a waste of money! Don't do it."
1,Try before you buy.,"My husband got this from me. Bless him for think of me but not even he can get it to do. The stitches slip off, it is very frustrating and had been back in the box now for a year. Just waiting for a garage sale."
2,Not as advertised...,"This knitting machine could possibly be useful for making scarves or small hats in bulk, say, for charity, however I don't honestly know what else I would want to make with it. It only knits stockinette stitch. It also does not do what it advertises. The box and instruction manual state that it knits up to a 13"" DIAMETER tube. I used various weights of yarn and none of my tubes was any more than 5"" diameter, once it was unstreched. I was generous with my rating and gave the machine at least 2 stars because I did find it easy to use and didn't have any trouble with dropped stitches. Overall though, I wouldn't spend the money and would stick to handknitting."
3,This book helped us determine what kind of help my son needs,"I would have to agree that this book is not what its title presents itself as. I was expecting a little more on how ""exactly"" to help my son Steven who is just recently 3 and has been diagnosed with moderate Autism Disorder. It did give me the positive boost and the push I needed to go out and get the early Intense intervention that I feel ""my son"" will really benefit from. It helped me to focus on the problem at hand and gave me a starting place to start my search for improving Stevens future. A good read for people new to this life change, however definately not for people looking for answers on how to actively facilitate learning. I also agree that it was a big push by the authors to use their method, and it worked on me, but I wouldn't discount other possibilities."
1,This book offers no useful information,"This book looks to me just as an advertisement for the school run by the authors. If you want a really good and useful book on Applied Behavioral Analysis, read ""Behavioral Intervention for Young Children with Autism"" by Catherine Maurice, G. Green and C. Luce. However, before reading it, read the wonderful book ""Let me hear your voice"", by C. Maurice. Those two books gave me enough knowledge of ABA, so that I was able myself to do the therapy and recover my 3 year-old son from PDD in less than a year."
5,"A very witty, brilliantly illustrated *little* book","A Short History - Thumbnail Sketches of 50 Little Giants is a book you cannot pass up, a marvelous gift, offering tidbits about people you thought you knew everything about (and didn't) full of wit and great illustrations in a beautifully designed book you will want to have for yourself too (whether you are short,medium or long). Don't wait for Christmas!"
3,warm hat but design could be better,the logo and seams of this hat do not lie flat on the inside and are not as comfortable as they could be if the design was better thought out.
5,Fit all my needs......perfectly,Stainless - matches my canisters and other appliances.Handles - so much easier to work with.Big - no need to constantly refill.Pours well - no clogging/sticking.Lid removal no problem - twist and lift.Wide enough for easy refill.Excellent product and well priced.
3,Pours Too Fast,"I keep these by the stove to use when cooking without a recipe. I've had shakers like these b4 and they worked well, but I find this particular salt shaker has so many holes, it makes it difficult to regulate the salt flow. Other than that, they're great and well made."
4,Great Game!,"This game is a lot of fun! You drive around San Francisco picking up customers and dropping them off at their destination. Arrows show you which direction to go, but you can't always go that direction!! There are oodles of scenes and passengers, so it's not like you keep driving around the same section of town! Many hours of fun.Parents, take note: the rating on this game is T for Teen due to some mild language. Also, a steering wheel for your computer is not required but will make the game much easier and more fun. If you do not wish to get a steering wheel, you can still use the keyboard."
5,i love this game,i think i got this cause sega made such a great game of this i dont have a dreamcast but when i saw this for pc i thought i need to get this so i did and i hope its what i think it is i would approve this for younger kids and young at heart crazy taxi gets a two thumbs up
2,Not at all what we expected...,"We expected this toy to be as big as it shows in the picture... IT IS NOT! Not even close. Even the box that it came in says that it should be 36 inches high and it's 18 inches if that. They definitely Photo Shopped that picture. The ""3 foot wide net"" that the specs state are only if you take the net off the poles and stretch it hard. Consequently, it is not much fun trying to hit a goal that is extremely small and falls apart when hit with a ball. The PVC tubing comes in about 30 different pieces and by the time you get it put together it is very shaky at best. I recommend that you shop around some more.~Disappointed in Dallas"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"This product is intentionally misrepresented on the box. We bought this at Target and it is a brand called Banzai with this exact picture on the outside of the box. When you put the nets together, they are about 12 inches by 18 inches and the box states 3 feet by 3 feet! It also has a picture of a water polo ball on the outside and tells you that it includes a ball but what is actually inside is a clear plastic beach ball which you could not even come close to playing a ""real"" game of water polo with. The picture on the box is a fake picture. It looks like the net would have trouble floating in the pool. We are planning on returning it so we haven't, but there is no way that even a kid could play water polo with this thing. I don't know how any company could clearly lie about their product and get away with it."
2,Battery continually loses it's mind,"I bought this unit about 2 years ago and love the features it has. Unfortunately some days the battery and the unit works fine, the next day it loses the entire battery and the unit is completely dead with no data left. Basically on good days the unit uses about 10% battery life, on bad days the entire battery will go all at once.Further research has shown all the Toshiba PDA's suffer from the same problem. Never will I buy one from Toshiba again."
5,so far the best one,"i had a very limited budget and primarily was looking for a PDA (less than [$$$]). after reading review of all the PDAs and PPC available in the market i decided to buy sony's SJ30 model which is also a new one. It took me about a month to reach on that decision and only for the reason that other PPCs were very costly and were loaded with some features like Flash memory card and Wifi which i never need. my aim was simple - to keep list of all essential information i usually store on my outlook. and suddenly i found this one on the market. even it was little more on my budget, it was perfect and i am fully satisfied. my patience paid off at last. it is convenient, elegant and easy to use. there are very few add on softwares available in the market but i hope their number will go up soon. i recommend this to those who are used to microsoft's sytems like outlook etc and want a high end PDA means PPC."
1,Not worth it - buy another product,I purchased this product and if I could do it all again I would not purchase it. I have had problems with it from almost the beginning. The unit constantly crashes and looses all battery power. This has happened during syncs or while just looking at the calendar. The PDA's batty level is high. Once it was at 96%. The only way to use it again is to do a hard reset - which erases all the data and to recharge it. This has happened several times. Toshiba support is awful and not helpful. another problem I've had is that the USB power sync cable I purchased broke a pin. This wasn't a part of the warrenty and Toshiba wanted $110 to repair the product. I am very dissatisfied and will not purchase another Toshiba product.
5,clay lubricant,I have used this product for quite awhile. It was recommended by a great friend. I have continued to use this product and am very satisfied.
1,ridiculous,"As the other reviewers state, the photo is hugely misleading. Along with everything else mentioned, the squares are shown as having up to TWELVE of the spray holes PER SIDE. The product has just two on some sides, and three on others. Don't don't don't buy this. I too am planning on contacting an official agency regarding this blatant example of false advertising."
2,follow the blue,the worst ending ever! brilliant writing the whole way through but let down by the unrealistic and very abrupt ending. if you like closure with story endings this is not the book to read.
4,Sawzall,"Great tool, much better than a cordless one. Anti-vibration technology works very well. Tons of power and never seems to struggle. I have cut just about everything with it. Highly recommend. Only negative is its weight."
5,Great Saw,"needed a saw that could cut without hesitation. While cutting pushed with considerable force to try and stall the blade, didn't even slow down. While shopping for this of tool found great range in the pricing. Locally $179-229.00. Online the least expensive was $169. Purchaced the say including delivery for less than $110. Very happy, look forward to using it this summer in the trees."
4,Good all in one vitamin - not coated though.,I shopped around when the multi-vitamins I was taking were discontinued and these seem to be the best out there for you.One thing to note that these are big pills and they aren't coated to go down easier. If you have trouble swallowing for some reason you might want to be careful around these.
4,Improve sleep and energy?,It's true when I couldn't sleep well due to lacking exercise and junk food I eat until I start One-A-Day men formula yesterday and I just had good sleep. It is weird but I feel sightly improve with energy and positive effect. One day doesn't make big difference so I'm testing to see if it works for me at least one or two weeks.
2,Too big and uncoated,This pill is SO big and uncoated and makes it very hard to swallow. I get worried before I swallow it because it has gotten stuck on the way down.
3,HOW DOES ONE RATE A VITAMIN?,"I take this fairly priced vitamin daily because of its formulation for men. Vitamins are ""blind"" items in that one never knows how effective or appropriate their administration is. One must rely on the company and this one has been around a while. Men should take a mens' vitamin for obvious reasons, especially as they age."
3,Several sweet projects,"The book mainly takes a basic sweater shape and provides different intarsia patterns for that one design. Not bad, albeit a bit blah. There were also some sizing problems in the instructions of one sweater and finding mistakes/typos is always frustrating."
1,Sloppy Editing Job!,"This is a cute book on the surface, but when you try to knit one of the patterns, you realize that either the authors did not know what they were doing, or they don't care to proofread the text to ensure that their clientel can actually knit the item!! I had to call the publisher 3 times to get the actual total and complete list of errata for the one hat - Dragon Hat. So beware if you try to knit that one. It is so cute, but if I wasn't an experienced knitter, I would have been totally confused and given up. I corrected 3 rows but the errors kept on coming so I then resorted to the publisher. If I were the authors I would immediately have someone go through each and every pattern to ensure accuracy and arm the publisher with the changes ASAP.If they don't have the pride in their work, why should I ever try another pattern or buy another book by these authors?"
1,Little Badger Knitwear: Knitted Projects for Babies&Toddlers,I thought this book was so bland and uninspired that I returned it despite being given it as a gift. The patterns are basic and not particularly well written. The examples photographed for the book were poorly assembled and clearly represented the author's inability to design a technically good pattern; ie a cabled sweater had a rippling seed stitch border because the pattern neglected to take into account the drawing in caused by the cables. Even an intermediate knitter would anticipate this problem and have an idea how to prevent it. Shouldn't a designer take care of this problem before launching the book? For a book as poor as this you really need an option of o stars.
1,Not a Good Book,"The book has great photographs and interesting looking pieces upon trying to follow one of the patterns I'm ready to throw out the project. It's as though a picture was taken of an item and someone made up a pattern they thought would work. One of the most confusing instructions reads ""every following alternate row"" and still I wonder what that means. If I were to decrease every alternate row the item would be lopsided...and there is more. If there were pictures of the individual pieces I could figure it out, but, alas, there are none.Just so you know my skill is a strong intermediate, I've been knitting for over 5 years.I tried to contact the publisher to see if there were any corrections made to the publication, no answer."
4,Adorable,"These knits are so cute that I feel like having another baby just so I can make it those little clothes! Fortunately, there are patterns for toddlers & older kids as well.Some of the patterns seem unnecessarily confusing since they are fairly simple designs. I think that measured diagrams(as in the Minnowknits books and others) would have been helpful.On the whole,though, it is an inspiring book!"
2,not for the prolific hand knitter,"The designs run a bit short on imagination.Many of the photos are of 8-year-olds, hardly ""Babies and Toddlers"".Small needle sizes = small gauge. Enormous amount of time required for each item.Not for the advanced/prolific/inspired knitter."

1,"There are some things a ""LADY"" should never tell !!!!!!!!!",I find it inappropreate that this author has chosen to tell things that aren't her place to tell. It's amazing that she can do this when Diana is not able to defend her self agaist these accusations that can be quite damaging. I found that she tries to slam Diana and make Charles and Camillia moral and upstanding. Did not enjoy this authors accounts of the truth as she seems to know it.
5,How refreshing....,"to actually read a full story of Diana's life, rather than the glossy image we've all been fed for years. Very interesting book."
1,Life is too short to read this,"The content of Lady Campbell's book is disgraceful, the writing poor, and the publication questionable. She is relentlessly biased against the late Princess of Wales, and in this book, as in the TV appearances she makes as a self-styled ""friend"" of the late Princess, criticizes the Princess relentlessly, pettily, and baselessly. With friends like this, who needs enemies?"
2,A Woman's Book...,"Basically, most of it you've heard before, except it mentions a few new boyfriends she had, and/or people she slept with. Other than that, it's vapid. Also, it told that she was mentally ill. I've never really heard it expressed as he/she did. Well, the last part relating to the few days before her alledged death were interesting. Otherwise, forget it."
2,I felt the author was biased against Diana,This book contained many so called secrets about Diana's life that I really don't think this author was privy to. I think she was biased against Diana and I found the book to be very distasteful in respect to Diana. I would consider this book mostly fiction!
1,Very bad taste - especially the timing,"Like most people, I was shocked by Diana's sudden death last year. Despite the fact that I was not her biggest fan in her lifetime, the event in Paris was nothing short of tragic.After reading this book, I was left with a very nasty taste in my mouth. Even if there was a shred of truth in any of it, it was in very poor taste to publish this so soon after Diana's death. Justifying the pursuit of the paparazzi by implying they were 'just doing their jobs'? Multiple affairs, manipulation of Charles' image, even a pregnancy by an extramarital lover which Diana apparently terminated? Not exactly a fitting memorial - whatever your views on the late Princess are.No stars out of five."
1,Totally worthless,"Lady Cambell in an uninformed, uneducated, unconnected, unacomplished, ill-bread wanna be. Oh and dear, next time you grace the world with your work, you should have your adams apple air brushed out for the book jacket."
1,Have just started the book so don't have a rating,I felt I had to post a review even tho I haven't finished the book. Was doing some research on Lady Colin Campbell ne Georgie Ziadie who was born in Jamaica.Reviewers who have made fun of her birth defect should be ashamed of themselves. The Adams apple appeared after she was given male hormones. She ran away from those doctors and discontinued medication. Surgery corrected her problem which her parents didn't know how to handle when she was born.Reviews should only be about books and writing style. Not personal problems. There is no reason to be so cruel. This is not the place to discuss it.
1,Poor Lord er I mean Lady Campbell,"This is a vicious book written by someone who obviously hated Diana, Princess of Wales. And if anyone is 'mentally ill' it is Lady Campbell. I understand 'lady' Campbell had a very strange childhood. Apparently, her parents could not decide whether she was a boy or girl! And I think it created a 'crack' in her brain.Diana paid dearly for standing up for herself and getting out of her pathetic marriage. Her husband was a Prince who turned out to be a selfish toad. She was definitely a lamb to the slaughter. And as for saying that Diana was schizophrenic that is postively ludicrous!"
1,Not Compatible,I bought this to replace a bad battery on my Sony Vaio and I keep getting error messages that the battery is not compatible. Go directly to Sony on this. You will be sorry.
5,yyeehh,all perfect!! shipped and purchase!! ....thank you so so much...I made my boyfriend happy: he tried for a long time on this comic!
1,"IT'S ""THE HUMILIATION!""","MICHAEL DUDIKOFF IS THE STAR BUT HE DOESN'T SHOW UP UNTIL 40SOMETHING MINUTES LATER! HE LOOKED LIKE HE WANTED NO PART IN THIS!DAVID BRADLEY? HE CAN'T ACT! PART 2 ""THE CONFRONTATION"" IS THE BEST ONE @ 3 STARS. THE REST? ALL INCLUDING PART 5 (PLEASE, NO PT. 6!) ARE D.O.A."
3,Dudikoff & Bradley are Great...,"This is not the best of the American Ninja series, but it is good. I thought the only bad part of the movie was the silly girl. Couldn't they have found someone a little less endowed and not so wimpy? Even the heroes want a woman who can watch their backs and keep up with them on the run."
2,"an Improvement over 3,but the movie is still hideously dull",Michael Dudikoff is the only reason to watch this film because David Bradley is such a bad actor. I guess the reason why not to buy 4 is because the fights are lacking dash and spirit which 1 and 2 had excitement this one is for the Die-Hard American Ninja fans but others like people who like high artistic quality don't touch American Ninja 4:The Annhilation with a ten foot pole.
1,All Time worst movie I've ever seen,"This was honestly the most godaweful movie I've ever seen. At first I thought it was a comedy and I'm still not sure it isn't because of some HORRENDOUS cliche's used in the movie. Not to mention that there are fight scenes that epitimize the essence of cheesy. Like catching the arrow from a crossbow in mid air with his teeth, and then with a flick of his head, spitting the arrow out to kill a bad guy. I wonder what the director was thinking to waste so much time and money creating such [junk]. I feel ashamed for even having spent time to watch it."
4,"""Sean, You Can Find Me At The School"" ~ Dudikoff And Bradley Shine","Michael Dudikofff of 'American Ninja' 1 & 2 comes out of retirement to save David Bradley of 'American Ninja' 3 who is captured in Africa by a band of evil ninja's. Say what you want but I love this movie. After all, who doesn't love story's where a few brave warriors defeat all odds and the enemy to save the day!Obviously not an Academy Award winner, but who cares. This is a total guy film. A couple of buddies with a six pack or two and you're good to go! Not to forget, the late Robin Stille is a very attractive addition to the story."
2,A tad better than American Ninja 3.,"The only thing that makes American Ninja 4 beter than 3 is the return of Michael Dudikoff. Sadly he doesn't show up until half of the movie is over and when he does show up, he looks embarrassed to be seen in such a weak effort. ONLY American Ninja fans should check out, but don't expect much."
2,Too small,"Strainer is decently made for the price but it is difficultto mash a teaspoon of tea leaves into it. Since you can onlyfill one side of this strainer, it just does not have the capacityto handle larger dried tea leaves. If you crush the leaves up abit, the resulting smaller pieces slip thru both the mesh and theseam. May work for some but has not worked for me.Capt Tom"
2,Cheap,"The latch on this tea ball pretty much doesn't work anymore. We purchased this just a few months ago. It worked well, although it was cheap, but now every time we use it, the latch comes open and all the tea leaves fall out. I would recommend getting one that is made better."
5,Progressive Stainless Steel Mesh Tea Ball,product received in good time and we liked it because it was requested by me to give away and use
3,Works as advertised,"I always like these types of tea ""balls"" but it feels like the rivet holding the two halves together will break eventually, sooner than later... Cheap quality for the price ($3.99!!! I didn't realize the price until after the purchase). I could have paid half that price and got two better quality tea balls. .."
3,Nice but small,"I have no complaint about the quality of the tea ball- but I found no indication of size in the Amazon description. At about 1"" in diameter, it suffices for a cup of tea, but will not hold all the spices I use for a recipe of hot cider. We made it work by putting the cinnamon in separately, but if anyone wanted to brew a pot of tea, rather than a cup, the tea ball might disappoint."
1,This tea ball is junk. Pure Junk.,"This is better suited as a really poor pair of glasses rather than a tea ball. I guess I should have known from the price, but how much should a tea ball really cost?! This thing leaks MASSIVE amounts of loose leaf tea into my cup, thus defeating the purpose of buying a tea ball in the first place.Look elsewhere if you like DRINKING your tea after it steeps."
3,"Inexpensive and durable, but does not keep the tea in","Much of my tea escapes from the tea ball, because the edges do not fit tightly. Makes for gritty cowboy coffee style tea."
2,lasted about 6 months,"While it worked, it worked great. But, after about six months, it would no longer stay closed and all the loose leaf tea would just come out. Mine never rusted in those six months, though."
2,"Useful item, flimsy though","Had about two weeks and it broke. I attempted a fix and hope it works. For the price one can not expect much, but a few weeks of use? Will not return; not worth the effort considering the cost. Well, expected better."
1,You get what you pay for...,"The ball is not very effective, as my green tea leaves find its way out of the ball and into my mouth, defeating the purpose of the ball. I eventually gave up and just put the leaves directly into my cup."
2,It works better as a strainer,I purchased this product for some loose tea. It doesn't hold the tea leaves in very well. I found that it's better to use this product as a strainer as you pour the brewed tea into another cup.
2,Did they move production???,"I ordered one of this tea balls about 7 months ago and quality of product was perfect. Solid ring, fine uniform mesh, fine chain with nice hook. decided to order a few for my parents and O My God!!! what a he.l happened to very good product. The tea ball I got was nothing like the one I got 7 months ago. Mesh has holes in it, chain has some cheap piece of metal at the end of it instead of fine hook. Stay away. This is not the product you want to use for making your tea."
2,Don't be fooled by the mesh,"The saying that something is only as strong as its weakest component is useful when reviewing this tea ball. Mesh is the answer to tea balls because they allow the tea to steep in the water as well as keeping the tea leaves from floating around in your tea and choking you when you try to drink it. HOWEVER: They way this ball was designed, the mesh might as well not even be there at all. The ball doesn't close tightly so all the tea comes out from between the two metal frames. There is a clasp but it does not hold them together tightly at all, and even if it did the hinge end leaves a huge gap as well.I do not recommend this product. Rather, i would go with the mesh tea spoon infusers which close tightly with a spring and do not leak. They don't hold as much tea leaf, but I think they are much better."
1,Junk,"After making about five pots of tea, the hinge broke necessitating manual placement of the clamp. Shortly thereafter the chain broke. This is a bit of shoddy junk that shouldn't cost more than a buck; at this price, a one star rating is in order."
1,There's a reason it's so cheap,"This tea ball fell apart the second time I used it. I know you're probably thinking, ""well, it's only $5; what's to lose?"" Instead, think of it as saving $5 off of the next tea ball you buy, because there will be a next tea ball. This is flimsy, poorly made, and after having it a week I'm already ordering a replacement."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,I used this steel mesh ball with my loose green tea and the leaves went right through it. You're better off buying tea filters!
1,BLACK SPOTS?? RUST!?,"I recently purchased the ""Stainless"" Tea Ball and paid $5.94 shipped from LUCCA. After the very 1st use, I went to clean out the tea leaves and I noticed small black circular spots on 4 different areas of the tea ball. I am not sure if that is rust or what, but I do not trust it! I contacted the vendor and they offered 15% discount. I have no idea what that means...I guess I am out the $6! :("
2,Blah!,I'm an avid tea drinker and I drink 95% of that from loose tea so I really need a few good tea strainers. I assume that all tea balls would be the same because I've bought most of mine from dollar stores or other cheap places anyways - tea balls are not all created equal. This one seemed pretty cheap and flimsy. Its a nice size for doing a whole pot (2inches) but I don't think I'd recommend unless you don't have dollar stores in your area.
3,Non-occluding halves,"My tea ball arrived expeditiously and looks pretty. However, the halves do not meet well when the hasp clamping the two halves is closed; this allows even the large tea leaves to leak out into the cup. It is inexpensive but cheap."
3,Not bad!,I got it cheaper at Walmart for 1.97 but it's my first tea ball and it's not bad. Little flakes get out but nothing bothersome. I'm also thinking it's just the tea I bought cause it was cut up in very tiny pieces. I actually don't mind it and the rest just floats to the bottom which I will probably drink anyway cause the tea I get is suppose to help my stomach cause I've been having stomach problems so that's another reason why I don't mind drinking the tiny flakes. I'm cool with it for now.
2,Not for the long run,"I am an avid loose tea user, but I feel like an idiot after the tea ball came apart into 4 pieces (the 2 mesh halves plus the chain and the clasp for the side). For the life of me, I cannot get it to seal the way it is supposed to. I am ready to invest in a much higher quality infuser basket that is just 2 pieces at the most and a no-brainer to use. I am the mother of four; I like things simple and reliable :)"
4,Good,"Works Great, the clasp is getting loose already but that is understandable considering the price. This works better than the expensive infusers."
3,Gets the job done mostly,Doesn't not close properly so some pieces slip through the side sense it doesn't close all the waySadly but it's still good about keeping the bulk of it inside and keeps themReady to seep and make some good tea :-)
3,Mesh Mash,"I like a mesh tea-ball, but this one is hard to mess with. If you are going mesh look for the mesh balls incorporated with a tong like handle. Much easier to fill and steep with. You are going to get sediment with any type of tea ball and loose tea, but mesh balls minimize that somewhat. Not to fear, tea settles to the bottom of the cup rather quickly, just don't drink the dregs like a cowboy taking a shot of whiskey and you'll be just fine."
2,Smashed,"Received this tea ball today - plastic cover hardly attached to the cartoon, both the cover and the tea ball smashed by other items. Don't know whether to return it or not since the shipping will be larger than tea ball's price. This is my third purchase at Amazon.com, and the first disappointing one."
1,infuser,The product is good and workes o k . But the catch is easily opened when in use. Tea leaves are released in the water. You have to restrain the tea before using.
4,Loose Tea for Me,"I've had this tea ball a good while. I dont see the rust some other reviewers have complained about but I steep my tea and then wash the ball and leave on the rack to dry. It is metal so I can imagine if you are leaving it floating in dishpans it may rust. Perfect for a cup of tea or two. The metal mesh is crushable, another reason I wash and put it away, but you can bend it back into place as long as you don't over do it. Considering the price it's a great find."
3,Fell apart after 3 months,"I see people complaining about the two halves not meeting well and tea leaves coming out. I did not have that problem. Mine worked well enough for three months, then the catch dropped off its hinge pin. Not reparable. As someone else noted, you get what you pay for."
2,Doesn't last,"The chain, or hinge has broken on 3 of these. Rust can also be somewhat of a problem after a little time."
3,what I wanted,needs a stronger package. the product was bent out of shape. just need to be package so it does not get squashed
1,"Cheap, fell apart before use","This product was constructed so cheaply that it came apart even before first use. The latching mechanism is held on by a rivet which was not strong enough to hold the latch on. All I did was pick it up by the chain and it pulled off. Probably this was just a random event, but quality control is non existent apparently, and even if it was ""normal"" I could not say it is constructed well. Buy this where it is easy to return, and plan on replacing often.UPDATE: The company ""FAT CUPID"" where I purchased this via Amazon.com did not reply to emails through Amazon requesting return or replacement. I advise avoiding them."
2,Boo,"Mine broke after 2 weeks of using :( the shipping was easy! The little part where it ""closes"" came off after two weeks of using. I order another and it seems to be fine. You have to be gentle with it."
1,"Ehh, not so great.","This fell apart after only a couple uses, guess I couldn't expect much from such an inexpensive item! Oh well."
1,Terrible product left my tea chunkey!,"This was a terrible tea ball. it seemed fine at first but as soon as I put lose tea in it, there were tons of little flakes of tea sprinkling out! I've bought this tea for years an have not had any trouble. this my tea ball just could not hold it an left my tea chunkey I had to use a coffee filter to get the tea out to drink.it!! I was absolutely unsatisfied. I'm going to go put my money into a Teavana perfect tea maker. I have heard a lot of people.say its expensive but worth it. Only buy this if you have a very large ground tea or for herbs and spices..."
3,doesn't close,"I read the other reviews that indicated that the ball doesn't completely close. I bought it anyway because I have had a ball like this before and it was wonderful. I use teavana tea and I have loose tea throughout when I take the this ball out. The rings don't meet after the closer is engaged. I solved the problem by using a mesh bag by lipton, cutting off the top, putting the tea in the mesh bag and clipping the top closed with the edge of this ball. No leaf problems but definitely a hassle. I will keep looking."
1,poorly made,"This is very cheap and is made in China. That should have been enough of a red light, but I got swayed by the positive reviews. The one I bought came apart in about a week. The pin holding the clasp popped out and that was that. Pay a little more for better quality."
4,Perfect except...,"This tea ball works exactly as described, and I use it often. My only complaint is that the chain is a little short, but it's definitely not a deal breaker (I just can't loop it around itself and clip it to prevent sliding). I just leave part of the chain out of the teapot, and secure it with the top of the teapot, and when I'm ready to pour, I make sure the chain is secure. Everything else about this works great."
3,A teensy bit less than expected,"Mostly pleased with these tea balls. They aren't as high quality as my other ones, but that would be expected as these are only a few dollars. The main problem is that the clasp likes to fly open when any tension is put on the ball (like raising it out of the tea), effectively releasing all the leaves into my cup. Also the seal is weak, and leaves like to escape out even when the ball is still closed. I only brew my tea for the recommended time, so the balls aren't being left to their own devices for very long, but they still thwart my clean cup of tea. They are cheaply made, not very sturdy. But all this being said, they are so inexpensive, especially in relation to how much my other ones were, that I don't regret this purchase, though I probably wouldn't have made it if I had known how clumsy they fit together. =]"
3,you get what you pay for...,"For $2.00 you get what u pay for. It works well enough, but tea leaves still get in my tea and the product is cheaply made which is prob. why it's $2.00. If u don't want to be bothered with tea leaves getting in ur drink and mouth...I would go with a more expensive product that is probably well crafted."
3,gap left leaves escaping,"This does hold a lot of tea leaves, but many of those leaves escape through the gap on the other side of the clasp. I just got the RSVP tea infuser spoon and its perfect, no gaps, and it closes flat, solid and tight. Enough room to fit 2 infuser spoons in my mug - I like my tea strong so might get another RSVP infuser."
2,upsetting,Bought this to take to work and was upset with how much loose tea it leaked into water. Would not recommend this product.
2,Will no longer lock after a dozen uses,"The little clip that holds the halves together stopped doing so after only about a dozen uses. In order to use it last time, I have to hold it together with a rubber band (eww). Clearly this is not capable of handling much use."
1,horrible,"bought this for my herbal tea and was very disappointed. It is very cheaply made, doesnt fully close, and started to rust. beware"
1,Mesh to large,The mesh on this product is to large and it lets the smaller bits of tea leafs into your tea and it is kind of flimsy.
1,Disappointed..,Have been using this for a few weeks now and I'm kind of disappointed. The ball doesn't close fully on both sides therefore leaves leak out and into the tea. It's such a hassle digging leaves out. I will definitely be looking for another.
1,Doesn't work,"This was my first tea ball and I was really looking forward to using it. Unfortunately, tea leaves came out like crazy. There's a gap where the ball comes together to close. I'm very disappointed."
3,Needs a finer mesh,I'll give this 3 stars because it probably works fine with larger loose leaf tea.But I use a finer loose leaf tea and have yet to find a product that keeps theloose leafs from falling into my tea. Any suggestions?
2,Rust ?,"This "" Stainless Steel "" tea ball is a very unique design, but after having it for only about a month with minimal usage, it's showing signs of rust."
1,Rusting or some kind of Chemical reaction causing discoloration,"Used the Mesh Tea ball for 2 days and there's a black marking on the mesh, almost like an ink. The second day, the blank marking started to appear by the base of the mesh. I'm not sure if this could be poisonous, so I stopped using it."
1,Wrong edition. Not as described.,"A Misrepresentation at best. The book arrived, but was the sixth edition which was obsolete years ago. The seventh or eighth edition is the edition which is in adoption in Composition classes virtually everywhere. This edition is virtually useless to students and instructors. The only possible audience is devotees of this series looking for a specific edition. I cannot imagine why this is for sale otherwise. Editions change and specific information, such as MLA, APA and footnoted documentation change immensely on a year by year basis. Fool me once. . . I really don't want to go to the tomfoolery of getting the cheap price back. Chalking it off. . . Thanks very much for nothing."
4,Solid reference to have on desk,"Now even though I had graduated from college, it's still on my desk. It's still a great reference. Pages are colorful, filled with practical and precise information. Easier to flip through than a webpage.The newer editions don't really add to much, besides a few improvements and likely adjustment to technology. This is a highly recommended reference for anyone. Plus, it's out of edition so it's cheaper to buy now.On a side note, I'm sad to see that Bedford decided to publish a newer edition so much sooner than their track record. In the past they've published a newer edition every roughly 8 years, but now it's down to about 4. Too bad they had to do what every other company is doing: publishing newer editions way too soon."
5,A must have for Writers,I would have been lost in my English classes without this book. It explains all the grammar rules and was very usefully in writing my first MLA paper.
5,Cant get through college without it!,"I have to be honest. I would have never bought this book if it were not for the daily quizes that my teacher took from it. However, this book covers EVERY question that I have in the wonderful world of english grammar. I don't know what I would have done without it. Its a must have for all students in college or those who just want to get the answers fast and with little jargon. Buy it, its the best money you will spend all freshman year."
5,Excellent source for anyone who needs to write something.,"Often when you're is struck by a nagging question in the middle of writing a document, you reach for some reference book that can quench the annoyance. Yet, there is nothing more frustrating than not being able to find the example and answer to your specific question in that reference. After minutes of flipping and searching, wieghing and guessing, you finally give up and decide to reword the whole thing in order to avoid the possibility of making a mistake. I have never had that problem with The Bedford Handbook. First introduced to me at New York University, I have used it ever since for personal stories to business proposals."
3,A little outdated and lots of racial and especially pro semetic examples.,"Far too many biblical mentions for a modern school setting, most being from the Old Testament. Several racial remark sentences. Nothing directly racist in the book, but there's a sense of superiority tangible in the book that kind of distracts from the learning experience. If you're buying this for required reading, make sure you buy the newer version. Many of the page numbers and examples are different, but I was able to get by."
4,definately a help!,"this book is good for when you're writing essays and you can't remember a certain format or something and you can flip through the book real quick for examples of essays, outlines and thesis statements, although I wish i had the cd version of it so i can always have it with me instead of toting around the book. they could have made the format of the book better.for instance i remember seeing a book called ""A Writers reference"" both are MLA format and one came from my community college and just the way its put together is better over all than this one."
5,Bedford handbook,Received product as promised. Bought this book in my first year of college. Book has come in handy with all my classes. Paid alot less than I would have in the school book store. Would buy from this seller again.
2,Hit & Miss,"I bought two of these, and only one works, but only about half the time. Return shipping would be more than the cost of the cable, so I'll be eating this one."
3,simply beautiful masal dabba,I was generally pleased with the quality of this product. I did not realize the individual spice containers had no lids of their own but that was not a show stopper. Just a warning: do NOT wash the lid as water seeps between the clear portion of the lid and the stainless steel rim. It took me some creative use of a hair dryer for about twenty minutes to remove the moisture. Since moisture and dry spices are not a good mixture I wanted to pass this along.
2,It serves its purpose.,"Well, this will serve its purpose but it is covered in stickers that do not peel off. There will be quite a bit of work to remove the sticker adhesive from the tin. I would say you are better off purchasing this from a yard sale."
2,No Spices ???,"Where does it say ""does not include spices""? I was under the impression that the ""Traditional Spice Box"" would come with the traditional spices. Very disappointed. Even thought the stainless steel container is nice."
1,A total waste of time and money,"While I have regretted buying some books in the past, I never have felt so shamelssly ripped off by a writer. This pap wouldn't make it in a Sunday supplement. Clearly written to cash in on the popularity of the kokopelli arquetype, this book offers absolutely NOTHING in the way of new knowledge or useful information."
2,Not as interested in Hollywood stories,"This is a long, too long, book in my opinion. Got tired of reading about Hollywood, particularly the Hollywood of the author.The book could have been half the size and sharpened up and would be much more readable, at least to me.I finished the book, but hd to work at it to get through. Guess the topic was not as interesting to me as I thought it would be.Those who want to hear all the gossip about Hollywood, as seen through the eyes of one person and that one person's opinnion, will enjoy the book.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
3,LATE MAUPASSANT,"Chronologically ""Strong as Death/Fort comme la Mort"" (first published in 1889) is the penultimate novel by Maupassant and the subject-matter of his late literary productions was much more narrow than that of his early ones. The plot in which a painter first falls in love with a countess, but later is tormented by his love for her daughter, because the daughter bears a physical resemblance of the mother (in her juvenile period the daughter looked absolutely identical to the mother, when the painter's love toward the latter started to grow) gives a lot of material for musing on the topic of love. The title is borrowed from the Bible, where the love is said to be as ""strong as death"". Nevertheless, the main idea here seems to be not that people of art tend to fall desperately in love and that their love may take eccentric forms, but that delving into something monotonous allows no room for novelty and, consequently, may destroy creative forces."
1,Don't bother,"These pants are cheap. They feel cheap, they look cheap and you'll look cheap wearing them. They're made of a nasty, stretchy polyester that is not comfortable at all.The photo for the pants is deceiving - they don't look that good. Spend the bucks and buy the Adidas track pants. I won't buy from this company again."
5,Poor Amazon Recommendation,"Beware! I searched Amazon for the front mud flaps for my truck. After selecting them, these popped up as the correct mud flaps for the rear. They weren't. I had to reorder the correct mud flap (57601)."
3,Nice product,"The rear guards were shipped with hardware, the front ones were not. Good luck finding black screws/washers if they don't ship them with the guards."
5,Awesome. Great buy!,I bought these sword so that I could have representations for a sword fight in a drama. This product met and exceeded my needs. The product arrived 1 day before it was scheduled. The seller was both prompt and courteous.
5,Exactly right for an unusual task,"I use this product for medieval horsemanship demonstrations. I do use it for striking light objects, and although that is heavier work than it is designed for, it does fine. However, if you should happen to make a mistake and end up falling from your horse on top of one of these swords, it will break harmlessly - I was not injured when this happened despite falling directly on it from five feet up. It is just right for what I do."
3,nice red wood,"the sword is pretty sturdy and has a nice red wood, i'm not sure if its stained, i think it is, the handle is slick so a grip is needed or make some grooves or tape it if you are going to use it in a practical sense. my only problem was that is was bowed, i'm not sure if all there products are that way or it was a fluke but be aware of this bowing, it can affect praticing with it."
3,OK Practice sword,"This sword is an OK practice sword. The hilt was loose and had to be glued. After that the sword was fine for the price. It is short 36"" and light... ideal for limited space indoor excercise."
5,Good sword for daily practise! Well balaced...,"Pretty good quality at quite low price. Suitable for Chinese swordcraft practicer. It's lighter than I previously thought, but still worth purchasing."
3,This one is okay.,"I am a big fan of all music of the African Diaspora. This CD not only exposes the listener to older forms of Highlife, but the performer also presents music forms like mambo and calypso that originate from West African music. The only thing about this CD that I really don't like is its sound quality. I'm a child of the digital world, spoiled by CD's and technologically enhanced sound mediums. I do remember old records, but I still favor digital transfers rather than analog or record to CD."
2,As an Optical Mouse: 3 stars; for ergonomical design: 1,"While an optical mouse can be of real help, especially for the mobile user, the form factor of this device makes a hard to use. Its small size results in a cramped hold and operation, thus causing more pain than necessary.The space saved using this mouse as compared to the Microsoft Optical WheelMouse or the Microsoft Optical IntelliMouse is only marginal. Yet, either one of these alternatives provides the same advantages of optical, rather than mechanical, cursor control, while allow for a much easier handling due to the more appropriate form factor of the latter models.Rather than designating this mouse for notebook users, Microsoft might be well advised to consider repositioning it as ""Optical Kids Mouse"", since its overall size and handling is quite favorable for younger users with smaller hands."
2,Annoying scroll,In less than 1 year the scroll wheel starting sticking which means that when you want to use it for scrolling the computer recognizes it as if you are pushing down the scroll wheel. The length of the wire is about 3-4 inches shorter than it should be.
2,I was great until it failed.,"I have had good luck with Microsoft periferals but this mouse failed me.I've used it everyday for about six months -- I've been a little tough on it but no more than to be expected of a notebook mouse (a little tugging, repeated plugging, winding up to be stored in a case, etc.)The failure seems to be the cord -- probably one of the wires in the cord is fraying. I'm going to replace it with a wireless mouse."
5,Just What I wanted,"This mouse was exactly what I wanted - a small, easy to transport mouse that I can use while traveling. It is compact but also thick enough to be comfortable using. It has a small unobtrusive cord that doesn't get tangled up everywhere. I just plug it in and it is ready to go.The mouse has light up sides, 2 buttons, and a scroll wheel. All work perfectly and easily - I didn't even need to do any adjustments right out of the box.In all, very pleased with the purchase."
3,Microsoft produces yet another mouse,"I recently purchased this mouse because my previous mouse broke. Overall, I am pleased with this mouse. However, there are a few things that I noticed about it that I would have liked to have known before I purchased it. First, it is a shorter mouse than I am used to and does not fit my hand as well as a skinnier mouse of the same width would have. Also, moving this mouse does not move the pointer on the screen as far as my previous mice and so I had to increase the sensitivity of movement on my computer to the highest setting.As far as the quality of the product goes, it seems to be a sturdy, compact mouse that will last and work well for a long time."
5,Love this mouse!,"I've had this mouse now for almost... yes, 5 years, and I decided it's time for a replacement. Even though the one I have still works perfectly. I truly love this mouse! It's size is perfect for smaller hands/women (a normal-size mouse feels clumsy compared to this), it puts up with wear (again, 5 years and counting) and it does everything a mouse is supposed to do. I'll never go back to a full-size mouse, this one travels with me everywhere, yes, it's also light and small enough to just throw into your handbag!"
1,The scroll wheel breaks quickly...,"I have had two of these mice, and within a month both mice had broken scroll wheels. The wheels are now locked solid and will not budge in either direction. I opened up the mice and discovered that they are assembled so cheaply that the piece holding the wheel in place eventually warps slightly, causing the wheel to rub against other parts of the mouse and it is the friction caused by this that prevents the wheel from turning. It's a nice enough mouse if you want a small mouse and a short cable, convenient for laptops, but don't expect to use the scroll wheel daily for any length of time."
3,Cable is VERY SHORT!,"I realize that for a laptop you don't need a really long cable. I had this mouse on a laptop and at that time I would have rated it 5 stars. Then I got a desktop instead, and because the tower's on the floor, this mouse's 2-foot-long cord is just not suitable. But because I love the ergonomics of this mouse, I bought a USB hub to connect it to the desktop. (Expensive solution, huh?) It is a really comfortable mouse and I recommend it *if cable length is not an issue.*"
4,possible to program buttons,"This is a great little mouse and contrary to what Microsoft says on its website, it is possible to program the buttons using their Intellimouse software. There is no option for Notebook Mouse but you can just choose Wheel Mouse Optical instead and it works perfectly. The only problem is that the scroll button on mine is quite sticky so that when you program that button to do other things, it's easy to click it by accident when you just want to scroll. In the end, I didn't find being able to program the buttons that handy (since there are only 3 in total) but it was nice to be able to use the other programable functions. About the size, I am a small woman so I bought it because it's the perfect size for my hands! But I do have very small hands. I use it as my desktop mouse with a USB extension cable I bought separately. It is quick and accurate and very light."
2,A great mouse...if you can make it work,"This is a very comfortable mouse for those with small hands. I wish I could use it. On my Win 2000 notebook, the driver was recognized right away and I was able to use the mouse with no problem. But on my XP Pro notebook, the software couldn't find the driver and an extensive search of Microsoft's dreadful support pages failed to turn up a driver. So I'm reluctantly going to return this mouse and look for a different one. You might think that a Microsoft mouse would work with a Microsoft OS. Go figure."
3,Amazing beauty,Fantastic images of the northwest of USA is what you will find in this video. It makes you want to pack and leave for this incredible places at once. The only problem is that there is no spoken or written explanation about the images so you don't know where this landscapes are.
3,Chomp Chomp,"A fellow horror fan told me about this movie a while back. I think he had read about it in Fangoria or something. Anyway, this is a solid indie release. Nothing too heady here, just a fun movie."
3,fair read,"I have to agree with sealsparrow. While the writing and story wasn't awful, I got turned off when a moment after the boss indicated he was attracted to her, he was hiking up her skirt and they were going at it on his desk. And how many books do we have to keep reading where the female character ends up pregnant? Yeah, that will keep them together! If you are looking for the great romance novel, look elsewhere. But if you are just looking to take up a few hours one afternoon, not awful"
2,For beginners only!,"Very short on the fundamentals of stance, movement and punches. Really limited on information for the reader, but a starting point before other books. My overall option is not to bother and go with Boxer's Start-Up : A Beginner's Guide to Boxing (Start-Up Sports, No 9)."
2,For beginners only!,"Very short on the fundamentals of stance, movement and punches. Really limited on information for the reader, but a starting point before other books. My overall option is not to bother and go with Boxer's Start-Up : A Beginner's Guide to Boxing (Start-Up Sports, No 9).The other thing I didn't like was that all the example pictures were of these two smiling idiots. Really took the meanness out of boxing."
4,Boxing at its best,"The book was pretty decent, it was able to discuss some of the key points of upper jabs. What I liked most about the book was that it gave good analogies. Over all I would say it is worth your buy."
5,Should be required reading for every student,"Clear, concise, easy read. The examples and metaphors are outstanding. After first reading, the national and international news is seen with a much deeper level of understanding. The reasons that New York rents are so high and that abandon slum housing is rampant suddenly becomes clear. The '74 gasoline ""crisis"" and the 2001 California oil crisis become abuntantly clear. The misguided but well-intentioned legislation that lead to unintended disasters can now be understood by all. This is a very important book. Brilliant in its apparent simplicity, but truly profound in its contents."
4,"Thomas Sowell, superb as always","In his usual way, Thomas Sowell clearly explains basic economics to the layman. The book has no formulae or graphs, being aimed at a qualitative understanding of the issues, but it has extensive examples.The only reason I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 is that the proofreading is pathetic. There are words omitted or substituted (""effect"" for ""affect""). In a particularly egregious case, he describes a difference as ""to percent"". What is that? A typo for ""two"", for ""10"", or perhaps for ""50""? In another case, the reference for a book is entirely omitted -- there's just a space followed by a period. Dr. Sowell deserves a more careful publisher."
5,Should Be Required College Text,"Thomas Sowell knows how to explain economics in simple terms without complicated graphs and charts. There's way too much goofy economic thinking expounded by the media, politicians, and educators today. We'd all be better off if we understood and applied the simple economics taught in this book."
1,One percent of 9 trillion is????,"Page 328:""... For example, out of a worldwide total of $9 trillion in international bank loans and deposits in 2001, only about $700 billion went to poor countries-less than one percent. Out of $12 trillion in international investment securities, only about $600 billion went to poor countries, an even smaller fraction of one percent. ...""I really enjoyed this book until I read this passage, now I'm doubting everything I've ever learned about math."
4,A Case for Capitalism,"The ultimate book for why Capitalism and a free market is the best choice for people around the world. Although this book could be used more appropriately as a text book for first year economics and business majors, it was a very interesting read. The examples Sowell provides in the first chapter alone is proof enough for Capitalism."
5,beyond the basics.....,It's amazing how little most people know about economics. I have little stomach for 'boring' books about subjects like this- but this book was refreshingly different. Excellent book to say the least.
4,I'm pretty stupid,"...but this book makes sense. Sometimes Hollywood blows hazy conceptions of the developer oppressing the poor and raping the enviorment. Sowell points out how free market actually does the opposite and prevents the tragedy of the commons. For the average stupid person ignorant of the economy, this book makes understanding economics relatively easy. I would have liked to see Sowell delve deeper into more economic theory. Buy this book if you are stupid."
3,The Usual Suspects,"Sowell's book is a rehash of his laissez faire economic philosophy, with at least lip service to the problems associated with it. I found the book valuable, however, for its very well written exposition of the beneficial role prices play in free market economies."
2,"It's ok, but there are better alternatives","I read only through quarter of this book and then stopped. I felt that the subjects needed reorganizing and many important issues were untouched. And at some points in its efforts to simplify it addressed some issues very superficially.If you want to learn about economics from the beginning then I recommend other books such as ""From Here to Economy : A Short Cut to Economic Literacy"". If you read both books you'll understand what I'm talking about. And no, I wasn't paid for this review... (even though I wouldn't mind if I was! LOL)"
1,More Politics Than Economics,"Written for those who have never taken freshman year Economics 101, readers who are trying to make up for a lack of higher education will unfortunately remain uninformed. This book ignores basic historical facts: For example, the writer completely ingores the OPEC Oil Embargo on 1973 and blames the oil shortage on America! Rather than teaching the laws of supply and demand (and the risks that supply can be manipulated), the writer attemps to sell the reader on his personal economic preferrences by ommitting weaknesses, adverse consequences, and facts to the contrary."
5,I learned a ton!,The author uses very good analogies to teach basic economic concepts. My understanding of economics is so much greater after having read this book. I look forward to reading his other ones.
4,Another Winner,"Prof Sowell has become one of my favorite authors. This book is another example of his clear presentation of Economic ideas applied to public policy.He provides plenty of examples of how Economic principles affect our daily lives in both expected and unexpected ways.My only critisism is that he sometimes repeats the same example in too much detail, too close to its last use. It makes some sections of the book feel like they were pieced together from many articles. This did not happen often and overall it detracts only slightly from the flow. It was enough to lose one star though."
4,Insightful!,"Anyone not familiar with the work of Thomas Sowell would be well advised to check out the blurbs on the back of the dust jacket of Basic Economics, where praise flows from conservative bastions like The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Times and the American Enterprise Institute. Take this as a warning that, even though Sowell's book does offer an excellent plain-English explanation of fundamental economics, its real mission is to explain how many societal catastrophes are caused by government policies he deems faulty. In so doing, he takes aim at minimum wage standards, rent control and, through his spirited defense of international trade, the anti-globalization crowd. But no matter which side of the ideological fence you occupy, we suggest reading this book for its insightful distillation of some of our most passionate political debates down to their economic essentials."
2,Heavy Capitalist bias,"The initial concepts described in the CDs are OK and make sense to some extent. But after a couple of CDs it was difficult to tell if I was listening to a book on basic economics or to a conservative talk show. Believe me, I am a big fan of conservative talk shows, but when I want to learn some basic concepts, I don't want to start with a heavily biased opinion.It sounded like the author was on a mission to establish capitalism in the whole world, mocking the socialist/communists societies at large. Moreover, he only took thoese examples that support his arguments. Not a single word on how communist countries like China have become economic world power. Anyway, that was not I wanted either. I simply wanted to understand the concepts and make my deductions based on that.Since there are not too many books on economy on CDs, I guess you can still give this one a try."
3,Bad Editing!,"Basic Books ought to be ashamed. There are an unconscionable number of typos in the text, including some I've never seen before in a commercial publication. Buyers should boycott this edition and write to the publisher with their dissatisfaction. As for the content, other reviewers have covered that well enough."
5,Great All Around Knife,I wanted a mid-sized knife that was versatile. The Victorinox 6-inch Chef's knife did just that. The blade is sharp and cuts like a dream. The handle grip is comfortable and stable in your hand even if your hands are wet. I think it's a great addition to any knife set.
5,Best money you cn spend on a kitchen knife,I have several of these in various sizes and the match or exceed anything else I have ever used at any price
4,A great bigger knife.,"I have used Victorinox kitchen knives for 20 years and love them for being sharp, thin and small.I wanted a longer blade and ordered 10"" and 8"" chef knives and they were awful- big, heavy, thick and uncomfortable.Then I decided to order this 6"" chef knife and it is exactly what i needed except it is still thicker than I like.If another knife i ordered is not better, i will keep this- it works well"
3,Not what I expected,"This is a good knife and very sharp but I have been spoiled by the Victorinox 10"" Santoku that I have used for about a year now. I was expecting to find this as easy to use, and it isn't, to my mind. It may just be a matter of preference - if you prefer the way a chef knife handles, this is a good knife, although a little short."
5,Best knife ever !!,"We've used the 6"" Victorinox knives for at least 10 years. They can be sharpened regularly, and always are the perfect size for dicing veggies. I really wouldn't be without them in my kitchen (or our kids kitchens ---we always take them when we visit).They're certainley affordable, and can be replaced as needed."
5,This is a great knife,"Excellent, well balanced knife which has fast become the most-used knife in the kitchen. Good for almost everything."
5,Great utility/small chef's knife,"I bought this knife primarily for cutting up chickens, which it handles with ease. It outshines my cheapo chef's knife from college so much that I've been using it for all of my slicing and dicing until I can get the 8-inch version. The six-inch blade is a bit small for some tasks, so it's better as a compliment to a larger knife rather than a replacement. It's a great knife to have around when a chef's knife is too big for the job. You really have to work to get the knife to slip out of your hand; the Fibrox is an amazing material. Also note that the blade is angled somewhat from the handle, which keeps your fingers from hitting the cutting board when you're slicing."
2,A Slicer; NOT a Chef's Knife,"By my way of thinking, a 'Chefs' knife has a number of functions, that include chopping - using the area nearest to the heel of the blade to cut through thicker, denser foods such as raw carrots. The maximum height of this blade is barely 1.5 inches at the heel, which means that there is not enough clearance between the cutting surface and your knuckles to perform the chopping procedure easily or effectively, if at all.And, the blade is so thin, and therefore flexible, that it makes chopping and similar procedures very awkward and inaccurate.While good for slicing, skinning and some deboning, due to its flexibility, I don't consider this to be good for most of the heavier operations normally associated with a traditional chef's knife."
3,Not very good,"For the price, it's ok. It is comfortable, and has a comfortable feel. This is a lower grade Victorinox made from stamped steel. It doesn't hold an edge very well, the steel seems too soft. The edge rolled over when I sharpened to 13 degrees. It does ok at 18 degrees, but dulls quickly."
3,great knife but...,I bought this knife about 2 years ago at a restaurant supply store. It was nice and sharp as it should be coming from the factory. But the more I used the knife the worse the edge got. Even after putting it against the stone it still didn't hold its edge too well.
5,Fantastic knives-have purchase several,I have purchased several of the Victorinox knives and love them all They are extremelysharp and I couldn't be more pleased. In fact I purchased a couple of sets for my daughter-in-laws for Christmas and then another larger one for carving the meat. It went thru the meat like it was butter. Will definitely get more.
5,SHARP KNIFE!!,"Purchased a 6 inch to replace another. This knife is very sharp, I cut myself twice the first time I used it. Cut through a tomato smooth and clean and very thin slices. It fit good in my hand, too. I am not a pro chef by any means, but with the right knife you can do a lot. Very pleasedwith purchase and will buy others."
5,Great,"I got this knife for my mom's birthday. She had already had one and loved it, but it was beginning to get old and we have two houses, so she wanted one for both. She absolutely loves the knife and uses it for cooking all the time."
4,"lightweight, but functional","I was surprised how light this knife was... it's weighs even less than some of the cheap Chinese knives we've owned.However, it is very functional. We've used it for two months and haven't found anything it can't do. The handle feels fine and fits both my large hands and my wife's small hands. We'll just have to see how long it holds the edge."
4,Great sharp knife,"If you want a knife that will slice veggies, including potatos, and is not expensive, this is a good one. I've only had it a week so I am giving it four stars. Hope it lasts this sharp for years. I've cut my finger twice - so be careful. But it does the job and makes chopping less a chore."
4,HUMAX Digital ATSC Tuner for HDTV,"This unit is very easy to hookup and operated.At near east side of Orlando city, Florida, I can receivedvery clear 30 channels off the air. Very well design box.The only negative about this box is occationally, the boxis hung (not thing responses even the box is turn ON.) andthe only way to recover is to unplug and replug back in thepower cord. All channels are retained after reset, so youdo not have to setup again. For less than $140, it worthedto own this box. No need to pay for cable."
3,Lock up problem,This seems to be a decent little HDTV over the air tuner but with the problem of locking up. Sometimes on start up and sometimes during scanning through channels it locks into a black screen. All buttons on the remote and tuner unit itself become useless. You have to unplug the unit and restart. After which it seems to work fine. And judging from the reviews of other buyers this seems to be a common problem. I just can't accept paying upwards of $200 for a piece of equipment that has such a flaw. Getting over the air HDTV is great but unfortunatly the Humax HFA100 is going back.
2,Needs a Front Panel Reset Button,"I have also experienced the lock-up problems reported by other reviewers. Indeed, avoiding certain channels reduces the amount of lock-up that occurs, however, it still does happen. When locked-up, neither the remote control nor the buttons on the front panel will do anything...one must unplug the unit to ""re-boot"". A hard-wired reset button would be helpful.I have observed the same problem on 2 of these units, which are just great except for the lock-up problem!Amazon very quickly exchanged the first unit...VERY good service!I am keeping the second unit because the picture quality and operation is excellent, and I have wired in a remote power switch for occasional ""re-boot""."
1,Lockups as others have reported.,"Yes, I too am a victim of the same lockup behavior. Since my initial unit was already in my possession for a while, I didn't try to exhange it with Amazon. I contacted Humax directly and they were mostly helpful and cooperative. I eventually got to a point where a return was authorized. A replacement unit was sent to me first with pre-paid return shipping for the original receiver. Unfortunately, the replacement unit behaves the exact same way. Very sad. In every other way, it is a great receiver. I may contact Humax again but not sure at this time."
2,Starting to freeze up,"The Humax HFA 100 is great when it's working, but it's now stuck on one channel. The station can't be changed. The remote doesn't work. The buttons on the tuner itself don't do anything. The unit can't be turned off. Nothing works to fix the problem, including unplugging the power cord and plugging it back in. When plugged back in, the unit is still on and frozen on that one station.I will call tomorrow to see how their customer service is. I'm not looking forward to doing this since others have had bad experiences with this company."
1,"Do not buy this unit, you get nothing but aggravations","I have had this unit for 4 months now. It works erratically. Lately it has been getting into a hang state where you can do anything with it, can't power it off or on, can't change channels,not from the remote, not from the buttons on the unit itself. Sometimes it gets OK after I physically unplug the unit. Other times even this doesn't help. This is a product that should have never seen the light of day."
2,Worked for 1 year and 4 months,"Buyer beware. I feel fortunate that the unit I had worked. It worked great for a year and four months. Now, I'm back to the regular broadcast channels. I am planning on trying a different brand from a bricks and mortar store that will be easier to return if defective. I feel, I was very lucky in getting one that worked. One thing it has taught me is that the atsc tuners seem to be much more problematic than the old analog ntsc tuners. I would be very carefull if buying anything with a built-in tuner."
2,very good when it works otherwise it is a headache other times,The Humax HDTV reciver has some problems.It freeze some times and does not react toany button on the remote. It has to be unpluged to reset it.It would freeze again later. It will overheatif it stays on for days. The screen freezes when thereis a channelwith some signal that it can't handle. Need to findthat channel and manully delete it from the list thenthe receive works again until next time it freeze.Wonder if the product was tested in any way.
2,Great when it is working. Require unplug to work.,"Same experience as others. The turner is great when it is working. It will lock up and require to unplug the power. (Since then I have plug it to a power strip and use the on/off switch). Call up the company. Have the same type of responds. Say they will sent me a replacement. Wait for 2 weeks, nothing happens. Call back and start getting the run around. I may just return this one and try another one."
1,Buy something else,"The mill does grind pepper, but that's about the best thing I can say about it. Adjusting the grind is a pointless exercise - the mill continues to grind at the same relatively fine setting regardless. It is cheaply constructed, from the nut on the top to the grinder mechanism on the bottom - and it shows."
2,Too large,Beads are pretty but the bracelets are very big. Maybe attractive for someone with large wrists. Service was good and quality of product ok.
3,got what I paid for,"Pretty nice price for the set. However, they were too small for me and the beads too big (I was hoping for small beads, these are close to the size of a dime). While playing around with them, I noticed that stain on them felt like it was coming off and left kind of an odd film on my fingers. I can also see that the black ones would fade rather quickly and lose their shine. Also my sister swears they smell of pot, even from across the room, though I can't smell anything..."
2,"Good Price, Not High Quality","Originally I was happy with my purchase, but after a couple weeks of daily use the finish on the beads is wearing off or fading. The brown beads have yellowed and begun fading. The black beads originally had a glossy finish, but now they are matte. I do not recommend this item, look else where. Good price, bad quality."
3,mala beads,The brown wooden mala beads are fading in color after only a couple of weeks. They are turning green.
3,For What They Are,". . . they're OK. I bought them as an add-on so I could get to a certain amount and get a discount on shipping. Not so noble, I guess, but I *had* been looking for beads.That said, I wasn't expecting much, and so, was not disappointed. They are inexpensive. The light one looks cool, and as the varnish wears off, I like them even more. They have a rustic look about them. The dark one is cheap looking. They don't look right together. I dislike the black one.I haven't noticed any rub-off residue, as I read in various reviews. Nor are they engraved or embellished, as the last review states. Maybe they were years ago. They are as pictured. Too bad you can't scratch 'n sniff-the scent is overpowering. It's meant to be sandalwood, but smells more like Lemon Pledge.I really like the knot, but after less than a week, it started to come undone.In this case, I got what I paid for."
3,Was too small for my wrist,These are well made and good quality but if you have larger wrists like me they won't work. They look fantastic but when I tried to put them on they were too tight for my taste and therefore won't work for me. But would be fine for someone a little smaller.
3,Nice beads but...,Nice beads but I didn't care to much for the matte finish of the beads. They were nice but was looking for something else.
2,Very Tiny,"The images here are deceiving -- these chocolates are very tiny considering their cost. The three tiny bars together are about the size of a square of baker's chocolate. The lavender flavor is nice, but still very little chocolate considering the price. Don't waste your money on this one"
2,Yech. once is enough for this soapy taste,"OK, I'm a chocoholic and buy the good stuff weekly from all over the world. How to describe this weird stuff? Imagine a milk chocolate bar from Lindt, like the standard issue. Combine it with a bar of soap from a fancy hotel's bathroom. Yep, it tastes like lavender-chocolate soap. Not good. The more I eat the more I realized this was a mistake."
5,The Best!,My favorite chocolate - it's wonderful rich chocolate with a hint of lavander...it always is a treat to enjoy!
2,Bad experience,"I ordered Globalization and Its Discontents for a class of mine. I had a few weeks to read the book, so when I ordered this book a week before I needed to start reading I thought that I'd be okay. However, the book did not come for 20 days! Yes, that is about 3 weeks! It was in bad shape: at least 15 pages were all folded over (not just a corner but literally folded in half). If I were just ordering a book to read for my own pleasure then I probably have been so upset but since I ended up only having a few days to read this book for my paper because it took 3 weeks to come then I wouldn't have been so wouldn't disgruntled.Globalization and Its Discontents"
5,The Truth Shall Set Us Free,"Brilliant. Penetrating. Dr. Stiglitz is to be congratulated for having the courage to reveal the truth concerning the cause, effect and consequences of the 1997 Asia Financial Crisis. Indeed, the truth is so brutal, so venal, so utterly despicable as to be rejected as mere fiction by those who would wish to continue to believe in the holy sanctity of the governing bodies of the world. But those of us who have lived through, and who have seen the suffering brought about by the forces described by Dr. Stiglitz, know otherwise."
1,The author sold out for fame and fortune,"Where are the models or the statistics that support all these statements? for example, that protectionism and capital controls create wealth or that the government is a more efficient operator in many industries. These ideas are certainly different from what he writes in his textbooks. The book is also very unfair with the IMF; it might be true that the IMF is very ineffective in it's efforts to aid third world countries, but it certainly is not the source of their problems..."
4,very informative. many interesting ideas. a bit complex though,"In this book, he explains how the policies of international economic organizations led to the crises in various countries when their economies were globalized. Most of his contentions center on the idea that the transition from communist to market economy was not handled well by the advocates of the free market if the IMF. Most of this book is about IMF policies and how they failed developing countries.This book is very interesting. He brings up many interesting points.The only complaint is that the concepts are very complex and it is recommended that you take an economics course before reading this book. He uses terms that they introduce in an economics 101 course and does not explain the terms. While it is not that complex, if you are inexperienced in economics, some of the parts will be confusing.This book rarely mentions outsourcing of jobs by developed countries. It is mostly about policies regarding growth in developing countries."
4,spechless,"mr Stiglitz, once again you left me with no words or comments whatsoever. right on the money , He describes the washington consensus policies of the world bank and imf very accurately. In a nutshell the one-size- fits-all policy is not working! Each country around the world is different! please understand that notion , is as simple as 1 +1= 2"
3,A diferent perspective,"It shows a fine perspective of Globalization fenomena. The importance, action and problems faced by actors and protagonists when taking decisions and implement politicies."
4,Good but lacks Argentina's case,"This book is a good way to get into the inside of an organization that over the past years has failed to provide economic stability and a higher standard of living to various countries by implementing their economic policies. Although there's a lot of information about different cases such as Southeast Asia and Russia, it lacks the one and most important, Argentina. The policies carried by the IMF in Argentina made the country fall into their worst economic depression in its history, first supporting a Convertibility system with no fiscal discipline, then supporting a devaluation that made most of the people in the country fall into poverty. If you're interested in the Argentinian case, you should read ""Argentina and the IMF"" by Michael Mussa.In general terms, the book written by Stiglitz focus on very important economic issues over the las 15 years and gets you inside the World Bank and IMF."
4,One of the Best,A great book which should be read by many to help them have a clearer idea of what is happening around the world. the author gives you what you need to know about the globalization process and what goes on behind the curtain that covers it. however in order to understand it readers should have some essential information of economics. great book never got tired of it.
2,Exhausting.,"It should have been subtitled: ""Or how the IMF screwed everything up, despite Joe's best efforts.""It's a tiring tirade."
4,Good critique of globalization,"This is a well-argued critique of liberal ideology at the IMF. Stiglitz documents and explains the flaws and the mistakes that happens when ideology replaces proper economic analysis. Stiglitz however at times assumes a self-righteous stance which might be a reflection of his anger at the IMF. Nonetheless, it was a good analysis of present economic situations."
3,Not a fun read... but incredibly insightful nontheless,"I don't doubt that Stiglitz is right. People with a background like that and have won the Nobel Prize usually know what they are talking about. But man this book is frustrating in the first few chapters. I initially categorized it as anti-western propaganda because it is extremely opposed to western policies. However, it is right. The economics of it are sound, the politics also make sense and the details of this are all laid out. You definitely need some economics knowledge to get through it and it makes a VERY good case against market fundamentalism and excessive deregulation. Unfortunately, the same market fundamentalism that drives the IMF is also what drives Wall Street and the Treasury and it's causing a lot of problems nowadays."
2,Misleading book title,"I was expecting much more from this book. I learned some, but much less than I wanted to. The focus was almost exclusively on the failing of the IMF (less on globalization), which repeated itself too many times. To me, it's a little bit discrediting when an author has an ""I told you so"" attitude all throughout the book - makes me want to hear the IMF's side of the story to get a more balanced perspective. Either way, this should have been a case study, not a book."
3,One of custards best known songs,"Along with girls like that, this song ultimately defined custards last years. Not a bad song but much more pop laden than previous releases.The other songs here are ok, yet another version of Caboolture Speed Lab, one of the better ones as it is faster. Lost and found is a good song which could have found its way onto loverama same with umlaut.Good overall single with solid songs which must have only just not made the grade."
3,isn't light enough,I have red hair and very fair skin. as soon as i put some on my finger and rubbed it into my face i could see the color changing but it's almost as if it was adjusting to the color of my finger rather than my face. my fingers are of course darker than my face. so it ended up being too dark for me. i tried 2 separate time to see if maybe i rubbed too slowly but i'm pretty sure i got the same result both times. i'm sticking with neutrogena fair to light 20
4,Very smooth and not heavy.,I have sensitive skin and can't use many products. But this product is great. Very smooth and silky to the touch. Doesn't bleed and smooths in easily. Good product.
3,Not that impressed,"I purchased this foundation with high hopes because I can NEVER find a foundation to match my skin perfectly. With my acne scars and redness it's hard to match a foundation so I got this to do the matching for me. However, it didn't seem to adjust color at all. I tried it first on my wrist, then on my face and both colors were exactly the same and did not match my face at all. I think because it comes out white it just gives you the illusion of 'color adjusting' but really, you're picking your color when you pick light, light/medium, or dark. Even if the color had been perfect, coverage wasn't enough and it didn't seem to set on my face even with a finishing powder. Won't repurchase."
4,works well,"I used this product with the smart shade powder in light. The foundation went on very nicely. felt good on, but did not cover well under my eyes. I was shocked when I put it on, it comes out speckley white and soon changes shade. it matched my skin well! the powder was nice as well and was great with oil control.they now make a primer that i assume will help with things such as dark circles and redness coverage.I was overall very pleased with the make up but the next day I broke out a bit so I assume it clogged my pores. The night I wore the make up, when I got home I washed my face and then used a face masque because my pores felt stretched out. Weird right... I have not used the make up since then but I am guessing that for some one with better skin than mine this would be wonderful make up."
1,Smells and doesn't cover,I have light skin and some slight area's of red on my face. I was looking to for good cover to hide these red spots. I bought this item in the drug store and it was on sale. The product has a strange smell and I can feel it all day when I apply it to my face. It feels heavy and doesn't do its job. It comes out of the bottle white however when I apply it to my light skin it looks all orange and streaky. I will not be buying this product again even if it goes on sale.
1,clueless?,I did not enjoy this book at all...though i had to finish it because it was required by my school. You can barely understand it and the majority of the time the author leaves you cluless. Reading this book will give u hours of boredom. Another thing is the book goes on and on and on and on and on...and just never stops. The sentences in the book are more for the people at Defoe's time. I would not recomend this book to anyone at all.
1,The mixture as usual,A compendium of second-hand opinions deriving from the odd bits of literature they've read (not necessarily understood) and the work of their friends.
3,Not the best,I have purchased this item for my husband to use on his little toe and the one next to it. But this item does not give much support. When you put on socks it slips of the toes. It helped him a little but not as we thought it would.
4,Toe Trainers,"This product has been helpful in re-training one of my toes to straighten. They can be a bit awkward when trying to wear them with shoes, but I simply resorted to wearing them at night with socks over them (otherwise, the velcro grabs the blankets!) Overall, they've been effective."
1,"stiff, squishes separated toes with their outside neighbors","This device does stay in place overnight but is uncomfortable and squishes the toes next to their outside neighbors. This is not good, especially if you are prone to athlete's foot.I didn't think this product was all that great at straightening that 4th toe either.This device is not as easy to clean as other toe separators.My favorite choice for a separator is the foam type (see my other reviews).What I'm doing now is using a bandaid to lift the 4th toe up like a sling. This keeps it from trying to go under the middle toe. I can wear the bandaid day and night, in shoes and sandles. Check out First Aid Only 3/4"" X 3"" Fabric Bandages http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EPQ6DU/ref=oss_product"
4,Helpful Toe Trainers,"These toe trainers are helpful in managing a difficult situation that has developed over the years. Also, they helpme to avoid painful surgery that I am trying to avoid."
4,ty'n something new,"this product took a little time getting to me. I am using it but it will take a while to know if it works,"
1,Very difficult to figure out.,"I have read the directions. I have attempted to make look like the pictures, but have notsucceeded yet. Very disappointed."
1,Not as effective as it looks,"The material is soft and doesn't bother the skin, but it doesn't keep toes straight. It is not as effective as it looks."
2,"meh, does this work?","I used the product a few times...kind of annoying. You first have to cut it so its not too big/long around your toes. It didn't work for me as I hoped, I can achieve better results with medical tape (though that process can get tedious when doing everyday, but I'd recommend for dancers out there who are concerned about their foot/toes)."
1,these are useless,they don't help straighten toes and they are uncomfortable - a waste of money. They are made from a thin material that just bunches up.
2,Ineffective,"This product was a complete disappointment. It did not effectively straighten my hammer toe, and it came off my toes after walking around the house for a few minutes."
2,does not actually do what is described - doesn't straighten my toes,"First of all, I ordered two packages of these and only received one. The other package that came was a bunion product, which I did not order.The product is made of extremely cheap material and doesn't do what is advertised -- doesn't actually straighten the toes. It's like wrapping a bandaid around my toe. Completely ineffective in my experience with the product."
1,TERRIBLE,"Do not waste a single dollar on this product. It is a piece of junk. I used it one day for an injury on my toe, and it was not secure and just rolled off my toes after a while. VERY UNCOMFORTABLE."
1,Toe Trainers - tempting but total twaddle!,These toe trainers were completely ineffective. They are no better than using tape for the same purpose. There was no change in the alignment of the two toes I tried training with this item. Save your money!
4,good difference in power delivery,took out the flat spots I experienced with my old cables. the engine runs much neater and smoother with no bogging down on the power curve
2,SEGUIREMOS ESPERANDO POR SODA STEREO,"Hola a todos los fans de soda, efectivamente este material no es del agrado de nadie, como documental esta muy incompleto y mal hecho, no contiene una sola cancion completa y el material no tiene mucha secuencia. Los fans de Soda Stereo seguiremos esperando un concierto bien grabado o un documental bien hecho. Comprelo solo si quiere entregar su dinero."
2,Poor quality,"Don't buy this DVD unless you are a hardcore Soda fan...The quality of the images and sound is very poor, and the sequences lack of a regular flow. There is not even a full complete song in this DVD. I was and still am a Soda fan, and saw them live many times while living in South America...but do yourself a favor and don't buy this DVD, get any of their CDs instead. They're all good!"
2,Seguiremos esperando...,"Como fan de Soda compré este DVD para tener por lo menos ""algo"" puesto que no hay nada más disponible, sin embargo queda un sabor a que nos vendieron un producto en el cual los Sodas parecieran no estar involucrados para nada.¡Qué pérdida!"
1,Avoid,This product is utter nonsense. Stick to yohimbe extract capsules (or yohimbine HCL). This topical delivery cream is ineffective and bogus.
3,B movie Cheesieness,"If you're looking for some cheese you've come to the right place. Some of the movies are better than the others. Infact I haven't even seen 'I am Omega' yet, but 'The last of the Living' made my night."
2,Ehh,"I bought this movie set to see last of the living, last of the living is terrible, you can barely understand the actors and honestly the whole thing is stupid. I am Omega is much better, so is Awaken the Dead"
2,Cheezie but...,"I was looking for a ""Friday Night Horror"" DVD set and bought this. It is extremely cheezie. I don't recommend this to anyone unless you're looking for some of that old nostalgia of the ""Friday Night Horror"" shows we grew up with back in the day. Most people will find these to be unwatchable. I gave them two stars because it was what I was looking for so no one star rating, but at the same time I didn't want to mislead others with a higher rating indicating a higher production value of these four pictures.All that said I am glad I bought this set for those Friday Nights."
3,Four independent Zombie flicks,"The Midnight Horror Collection is Echo Bridge's new budget line of licensed independent films. Each set features four films on one double-sided disc. Flesh Eating Zombies Series is one of the better sets. These aren't George A. Romero classics but decent low-budget independent flicks worth a look for anyone who love the Zombie/Horror genres.Last of the Living and Asylum's take on Richard Matheson classic novelI Am Legend, I Am Omega (made to cash in on the big screen adaptation starring Will Smith) are definitely the highlights of the set."
3,Kind of Deceiving,I was under the impression it would be four different discs. I made Zombie Candy Survival Kits for family members and wanted to split the discs. Anyway it doesn't really express that its all on one CD. Wish it would have said so somewhere.
1,It's a no buy,"Disappointing... I could not recommend this set, could not finish it :( Maybe I should have taken the one star reviews into my buying acocount."
3,Good board but mine warped,"It's good to use polypropylene boards to keep germs away and food preparation safe. I'd definitely recommend this board for that. The problem with poly boards is that they are slip around on smooth countertops, making cutting a little more challenging. However, grip corners are only handy if they have contact with the counter surface. Mine has warped slightly so that it bows slightly upward on the ends, rendering the grip corners useless."
2,Good for maybe 5 to 10 uses or so...,"I purchased mine as a temporary solution for a small kitchen in a small apartment with little space until my wedding day. I'm an avid cook, so I figured it would only last me until the wedding (and the registry, for that matter)... well, I've had it for almost a year now, and it's done everything BUT warp. It's picked up numerous stains and deep cuts despite taking care of it as I would my finest wooden chopping block. It's done pretty well as far as not warping in the dishwasher, but I've scrubbed and soaked repeatedly, to no avail for the stains. To rubber grips are on the side of useless as well. Even with everyday use, i've had to stablize it on occasion.Won't do this again. The weight was a nice factor for a small cramped space and having to move it back and forth into storage, but essentially you're getting what you pay for."
3,Not as skidproof as you'd hope.,"This is a solid board, and easy to keep sanitary. But the rubber corners are of a hard compound that does not grip my Formica(tm) countertops well- so it still slides. I'm back to putting a damp towel under it like I did with my plain poly cutting board."
5,Can't Believe,"I can't believe this concert is not coming out on DVD. This double cd is a must for any VDGG fan. Hammill has lost very little of his treasured instrument/voice. The band sounds fantastic. ""Sleepwalkers"" and ""Arrow"" have a harder edge to them, making classic tunes even better. The rest of the cd is equally as good. ""Nutter Alert,"" ""Every Bloody Emperor,"" ""Man-Erg,"" and ""Childlike Faith in Childhoods End"" will make you stand-up and cheer as if you were there in Great Britain. BUY THIS CD then PLAY IT VERY LOUD. David Jackson will amaze as will Hammill."
3,vampire-the masquerade redemption,Fun low tech game. your basic early D&D type of game. Worth a bargain type of price but not a $40 game.
5,Fantastic reference for medical transcription,"This book has everything the standard references lack! All the latest medical slang, ER terms, unproven cancer therapies, drug names outside the USA, it's all here. The book is organized by specialty, and also has sections for vocabulary, clinical trial acronyms, etc. My favorite chapter is the one on tests, scales, and scores -- all kinds of terminology relating to lab tests and diagnostics, as well as tests for the patient to perform at home. I've only had the book a few days and it has saved me a lot of time. Anybody working in medical transcription needs this book. If you're thinking of a career in this field, take a look, you might be overwhelmed at what you would be getting into!!!"
4,"Fun toy, didn't last as long as I'd hoped","I bought this toy for my 14 month old son and he enjoys it. He loves to push things around the house. Though it is fun, I get the sense that it would have been much more exciting if I had given it to him about six months ago.In terms of construction, the toy appears well made and looks like it can stand up to the abuse that a little kid will throw at it. I can't say for sure, though, because he only got it about a week ago.Update: After about a year of occasional/moderate play a spring or some other part inside the toy has broken. Now when you push it down and let go it just snaps back to its original posture, but without driving forward. It is still fun to push around, though. I just wish I could pass a fully functional version down to baby #2."
5,My 20-month old loves it,"We got this as a first birthday gift for my first child, pulled out again five years later for my second. She's now 20 months old and has recently taken a great interest in this inchworm. She can make it go by herself, scoot after it, and turn it around and begin again. Very easy to entertain oneself with this! Also great for sibling interaction - my older child gets the inchworm going, and my younger goes to retrieve. Lots of laughs with this toy!"
4,My 10-month old nephew loves it!,My nephew and I have really enjoyed this toy. He loves to chase this little inch worm all over the house. The quality is excellent--very durable.
4,Great toy; easy to operate.,"This toy is adorable, and my son loves to push it around the floor. He is 12 months old, and he giggles every time it runs away from him."
3,A good gift,I bought this for my 2yr. old niece & its still around..so it's durableIt was just as it appeared. and works great an easy fun toy for any small kid.and at a good price.
3,Not fun yet,"My 1 year old daughter hasn't really mastered the use of this toy. I would recommend it to older toddlers that enjoy cars or things that roll. The push mechanism seems to be too difficult to use for a younger baby. It does roll quite far when pushed down but I do think it is overpriced for a toy that seems to be made of cheaper plastic. Overall- not sure if I would purchase this again if given the choice, but if your child loves rolling toys they will probably love this."
4,"Great ""lo-tech"" toy","I purchased for my 1 year old grandaughter. What a wonderful, basic toy to entertain young children. The only complaint is that it is a bit hard for a child her age to press down. I feel sure she will enjoy it much more when she gets older. Works well on both carpet and hard wood flooring."
2,Not that great,"I was hoping my 2 and 3 year olds would love this, but they never got into it and it broke after not that much use. I didn't think much of this toy."
3,Just so so,My 11 month old baby did not pay any attention to it. I was going to return it but finally I decide to keep it for my coming nephew.
2,Kidoozie,"Compre este juguete por tan buenas revisiones que tenia, pero dejenme decirles que este juguete no es para nada divertido. Solo es apretar hacia abajo y el gusano correo, pero mas alla de la propiedad causa y efecto no van a encontrar en este juguete. Lo unico que no se puede negar es la durabilidad."
4,Good toy,It was great for our 1 year old granddaughter and even her 4 year old brother thought it was neat.
5,The best anatomy coloring book--EVER!!!,"This coloring book is the most comprehensive and descriptive coloring book of them all. I learned so much just by coloring in all the pages. To this day, I use the pages that I colored over 20 years ago as a model when I explain to my patients about the symptoms they are experiencein (I am a physician assistant). You can't go wrong with this book!"
2,Too small !,This universal seat cover is not universal. My 2008 Chevy Silverado has the high back seats pictured in this product's add. The seat cover is stretched to the max. The fit is so bad I am sure the seams are going to tear out way before the cover should wear out.
1,piece of junk,This product is a piece of junk. The day after I put it on my car seat the cheap seams began splitting. This was a huge waste of money.
3,"Excellent musician, poor sound quality.",I was disappointed with the harsh quality of the harpsichord when I played this cd through by audio system. It sounded tinny and thin. I have other harpsichord recordings and none of them sound like this. I don't play this cd as a result. It only frustrates me when I can listen to a far better quality through by computer on youtube. Too bad. I recommend you pass on this label.
3,"Worked, too expensive",I got this because I didn't want to risk my birth ball rolling down the street when trying to get into the hospital. It definately did what it was supposed to (though I've never tried it on a smaller ball). I was just dissapointed that I paid that much for 2 strips of elastic. The slip resistance is simply that it's elastic on plastic. Nothing special on it. Next time I would just sew the few stitches myself and make a loop at the top.
5,HOPELESSLY DEVOTED TO OLIVIA,"I'm a mexican fan of the Great ""Livy"" Newton-John and I'm desperate looking for the videotape ""Soul Kiss"". I have ""Olivia In Concert"" and ""Physical"". Can anyone of you e-mail me and sell me a copy from your original to own one more Olivia tape? Thanx a lot!"
4,Mathematical approach to tactical asset allocation,This book describles a very interesting approach to tactical asset allocation. Detailed mathematics are developed for processing information and allocating risk such as to maximize the expected information ratio of a given asset allocation. The book is very condensed and requires a very good understanding to fully appreciate the quality.
3,Not My Fave!,I've definitely used better moisturizing conditioners! Smells great! Didn't work well for my curly hair!!! Had a crunchy feel to my hair after washing!
5,Perfect Album!,This album contains all her best performances.Adele's aria is rare to find in other records and her singing isjust vivid!
3,She only did it twice this time,"I used to have lots of her, and threw it all away (except Rigoletto, even she couldn't ruin that one) in disgust and anger and contempt. I bought this CD for only one thing: Zerbinetta's aria. No one else that I can find sang it except Sumi Jo who left off 5 minutes of it. I'm so angry, I want to call this woman (Gruberova) a PIG! She's a phony. A waste of time and a waste of talent and mellifluousness and skill. With all she's got going for her, she will ruin, spoil it all by SLIDING with insouciance to the top notes instead of making a clean break and jumping to them. There aren't that many good coloraturas out there, why lose one? Like I said, she only did it twice on this album, and she does sing Zebinetta's aria, so I'll keep it. I'll never play the gd thing again, but I'll keep it. What the hell is her point? Is this her signature? Her style? Bad singing?"
4,"Great overview coffeetable reference book for musicians, composer, artists...","A great gift for musicians and artists.Great overview book --- cool little painted illustrations of all the instruments --- they kind of look somewhere between photos and paintings -- it gives the whole book a nice consistent look.Professionals might think the tone/text content a little remedial (primarily on the 'contemporary' instruments like Electric Guitars/Synthesizers, etc. -- the text sounds a little corny to a pro ""yeah, yeah, I know what a volume knob is and what a pick-up is..."") -- but overall a great way to reference all the world's regions and cultures and their instruments.I gave one of these to a composer friend who does soundtracks for films/TV -- and he's used it several times to quickly zero in on an odd or unique instrument he'd may not have been able to research quite as easily."
3,USS Pueblo executive officer's account,"This is a beautifully bound and printed account of the USS Pueblo incident in the late 1960's from the view of the executive officer. The author writes more a personal statement/apologia than a historical account.Of the handful of books around, this is one to read. It is less known that the captains account.Thanks to Amazon, I bought a used copy for little money that seemed to me ""as new"""
1,Poor Quality and Poor Features,"The Memorex CD Clock Radio should not be listed in the class of $80 radios. It is more like a $19.99 special. First, the digital AM/FM tuning consists of a dial with a digital frequency display. It does not lock the frequency in at all, it just displays the frequecies. It has no presets. Second, the time cannot be displayed when the radio is on, so all you see is the radio frequency (you have to push a button to see what time it is). Third, the time display is very small. Fourth, the quality overall is cheap. The CD player is noisy. The buttons are inconveniently located. The speakers are tinny sounding. Overall, I was very disappointed. So, I would NOT recommend this product in any way at any price."
5,Dual Disc at it's best,"I agree with the other reviewer Mudvayne 5.1 = heaven, well it's true, this one was done very well, sounds amazing. If you have a 6 channel system or above get this. I think this is Mudvaynes best album, nothing can touch it, it's pure, raw and full on hardcore passion, if you got a decent system hooked up, crank this and it is like heaven, sounds much different then the stereo version, adds a whole new world to it."
3,An old standard,"This is the play that George Washington had performed for the Army at Valley Forge. My carreer Army officer grandfather and his generation were familiar with this play, but that Army is gone and the play is forgotten.I found it to be a challenging read."
1,"bad , bad cd !",I DON'T LIKE THIS CD. IT'S AS GREAT AS THE COILS YOU INSTALLED ON THE RC CAR! JESSE WAS RIGHT TO SCRATCH YOUR CD! DON'T QUIT YOUR DAY JOB PROFESSOR. WHEN IN THE GARAGE NEVER TOUCH A MAN'S BLACK SABATH. MONSTER GARAGE RULES!!!!!!!!! SORRY SHEP IT SUX!
4,IT'S ONLY PART OF THE STORY,"WHAT'S ON THIS CD IS EXCELLENT BUT IT'S ONLY PART OF THE CLOVERS' STORY.I KNOW YOU CAN'T GET EVERYTHING THEY DID ON ONE CD BUT WHY CAN'T SOMEONEPUT OUT A BOX SET OF, SAY, THREE OR FOUR CD's WITH ALL OF THEIRSIGNIFICANT SONGS TOGETHER. THIS CD, WHEN COMBINED WITH THE ""DOWN IN THEALLEY"" CD FROM ATLANTIC RECORDS, MAKES FOR A MORE COMPLETE COLLECTIONOF THE WONDERFUL RECORDINGS FROM THIS OUTSTANDING GROUNDBREAKINGGROUP FROM WASHINGTON, DC.THESE ARE THE ORIGINAL RECORDINGS AND THEY SOUND TERRIFIC. I HIGHLYRECOMMEND THIS CD TO ANYONE WHO ENJOYS THE ORIGINAL SOUNDS OF THAT ERAAND THE REAL ROOTS OF ROCK & ROLL. JUST KEEP IN MIND THAT THERE'S ALOT MORE TO BE HAD TO DO THE CLOVERS JUSTICE.ENJOY THIS CD AS I DO, BUT GO FOR THE REST OF IT. IT'S GREAT!BY THE WAY: WHY AREN'T THE CLOVERS IN THE ROCK & ROLL MUSIC HALL OF FAME?THEIR ABSENCE IS A CLEAR INJUSTICE!"
2,Better planning books availble,"I recently purchased this book along with a few others for my upcoming trip to Disney. It will be our first trip there as a family ( I have a 9 and a 2 year old). I found this book to be my least favorite by far. The information is generally vague and is repetitive (eg. ""avoid carrying to much stuff......don't forget to bring your camera......wear a raincoat"") by the time you read this 4-5 times you kind of get the point. My favorite book to date is The Unofficial Guide to WDW 2005 and also ranking in my top picks is Fodor's WDW & Universal Orlando with Kids 2005. These books get down to the specifics, if you want to eat breakfast with Cinderella in the Castle, the Unofficial Guide has the details to give you the best chance at securing a priority seating (I was able to get priority seating for two different days).Some people might find that this book is enough, but for me I needed more."
2,Out of date book,This book is way out of date. Many things hve changed in Disney since this was written. I recommend one of the Birmbaum guides instead (especially the Kids version).
4,A wonderful teaching tool for meditation!,"The explanation of the chakras, the music, Shirley's soothing, flowing and guiding voice...all wonderful. As a beginner, I found only one thing distracting. The chakras changing color half-way through their presentation. It's hard focusing on seeing those chakras within one's self while watching a screen, learning how to use them, etc. When the additional colors came into play, my ability to stay focused on the original color and why any certain area was any certain ""color"" and how it was incorporated was compromised. I learned to watch just long enough to see and ""feel"" the color, then close my eyes and simply listen, visualizing internally, until she moved to another chakra. Second guided meditation...WONDERFULLY done!"
4,Great going out on a limb with Shirley,"I found this to be a challenging, but rewarding video. Shirley artfully takes you through Chakra work and guides you through two wonderfully different meditations. Be sure to have time set aside with no interuptions. I found this most effective in the evenings when winding down from a tough day. It also helps one acquire good habits for meditation, concentration, and visual practice for quiet time outside of the video. If you like Shirley MacLaine's books and relate to her unique beliefs on life (and after), you'll appreciate this inner work out. I got it as a gift and was thrilled!"
3,Disappointing video quality,"I bought this video because I had viewed it before and was interested in it for the content. I expected a new copy to have better picture quality. Sadly, that was not the case. Given the price, it was extremely disappointing."
4,Great value/Fun to play,"Let's face it, a playable electric bass guitar for under $150, with a gig bag, cable and extras, is hard to believe--yet Stagg delivers! This axe is not without its flaws, for example some fret rattle, but for the money this former gigging bassman is quite satisfied with his purchase. Note: Some of the volume/tone pots arrived a little loose, but a simple adjustment with a wrench solved this minor problem (just pop off the knobs and tighten a wee bit if needed). I love the natural finish (hey, it even matches the wood floors in my house!)."
1,worst product (this product should be called no star),"this is product should not be sold on line or in stores, but should be sold in junk yards cos since i bought this guitar, i have not been able to play it.when you tune the guitar, you dont get the actual sound.very bad.not to be sold"
3,My Pet Peeve,"One of my pet peeves is the misuse of the pronoun ""your"" and the contraction ""you're"" for you are. I see it everyday on the net but this is the first time I have seen it on a major media product. Amazingly they did use ""it's"" properly.The front and back covers state ""It's the land of opportunity...If your good enough!"" You can see it in one of the pictures above."
2,From Back Cover,"Falsely accused of a crime, Jonas Goodfellow has already encountered enough mis-Fortunes since meeting his 'family' without looking for more. But even common sense and a jaded heart couldn't make him resist sweet Tara Summers - the loyal assistant who'd believed him throughout his ordeal. Holding her in his arms, Jonas felt that his long-denied dreams were attainable. Until he discovered Tara was carrying his child. Could Jonas now face his greatest challenge... to become the husband Tara deserved?5th in The Fortunes of Texas: The Lost Heirs series"
4,Returning to my childhood,"I recently began re-reading the Black Stallion series, some 60 years after I read the books as a child. The stories and the author's love for horses have stood the test of time. This one is a fairly straightforward story with a predictable solution, but, hey, that's why we read these books as horse-crazy children and why we re-read them half a century later. Some I'd never read before, mostly because I grew up and went away to college and got married and left my horse stories behind. I'm working my way through them in the order in which they were published."
1,Unmemorable.,"I don't know why the publishers kept this book in print and pulled ""The Black Stallion's Sulky Colt"" because the best thing that can be said about it is unmemorable. If, by the time you read this one, you feel like you've read the race scenes a million times over, guess what!, you have. They don't change much from book to book (I think the only thing that changes is the names of the compedators and the track) and if you continue reading the series, you'll run into more of the same. After the main barn at Hopeful Farm burns down, the Black is taken out of retirement in order to raise money through racing for another one. The book doesn't break any new ground and over the course of 20 chapters, it doesn't go very far."
2,Japan competitiveness,"This is an interesting book, but it seems to really grasp one or two key elements of Japanese culture and then try to apply it to the rest of the foreseeable future. This book misses the fact that the Japanese people are some of the most hard working and resilient cultures in the world."
2,Insightful but faddish after all,"A decade seemingly is a long time. Porter, et al.'s conclusion is that Japan's industrial policy and industry regulations as well as Japanese corporate strategy by ""imitation"" (which I would rather call learning from others when needed) were all wrong after all. Thus, global admiration in the 1980s to global discounting of Japanese governement and business practices... How about the competitive weaknesses of U.S. companies in the 1980s to their glorious revival in the 1990s? Did anything fundamentally changed within U.S. companies in the way of strategies in the 1990s? How about the situation today? In my mind, much of corporate performance still depends heavily on the macroeconomic state of the domestic economy. While Porter, et al.'s book may be ""fashionable"", it fails to deliver the fundamental that appropriate strategy is dictated by the ""climate of the time"" and the situations companies are in."
2,Not what is Pictured,"Is not the nice Gray color shown, looks really cheap in the bag thin material. Plus it took forever to arrive. Somehow my order was ""Overlooked"". Not really happy so I am sending it back!"
1,Disgustingly overpriced,"This exact package sells other places for less than $40. Either this product is old, the price is wrong, or it's made out of titanium dipped in gold and then rolled in diamonds."
2,What were they thinking?,"It was a terrible marketing decision to use the Bach Cello Suites as a filler for the other modernistic pieces that they were coupled with in this ECM New Series featuring Thomas Demenga. The liner notes go to great lengths to sell the buyer on the ties that bind the Bach to the 20th century composers but it sounds more like begging than explaining. The Zimmerman, the Hosokawa, Yun, Verese, Holliger and Carter pieces need to be collected together on a series of recordings and the Bach either jettisoned or sequestered. Maybe someday a re-release will save what's good about this series and reduce 6 mediocre CD recordings down to what should be 3. Buy the Bach elsewhere--there are over a dozen great choices."
1,never again with go hastings!,"I purchased all the Drawn together DVDS , seasons 1,2,3,and the Movie. This is GREAT adult entertainment! The problem was with GO HASTINGS!GO HASTINGS said they had all the DVDS in stock in VERY GOOD CONDITION!! Well season 3 was a complete wreck!!The dvd box was dirty and the art work was made on a printer, and was not the art work shown in the ad, the dvd was SCRATCHED AND GOUGED BEYOND REPAIR AND WOULD NOT PLAY!The rest of the dvds are in OK condition they all play,but the dvds ,box,and art work show a good amount of wear!,scuffs,and scratch's ,they should have been advertised as fair to good condition. Not VERY GOOD CONDITION!Go Hastings gave me a refund for season 3, now I have to find it some place else.I will not be doing business with them again!"
4,A Good Buy!,A great buy if you have loved the previous seasons. If not I suggest starting from the beginning or you will be lost. But overall a great package.
1,Worst Cartoon ever made,"This is the worst cartoon ever made that I have seen, although I'm sure there are worse , I just haven't seen them."
4,Hooray CJ!,"This album is a treasure. Channel Fever is a follow up to the Rock The Zydeco/Atcha album (the album was released under both titles). As with that album this is a nice mix of country, zydeco, rock and roll, and blues with an intimate feel. I think it's equally as good as his previous release and if you enjoyed it, this is more of the same. However I would suggest that if, as is most likely, you're curious about Chris Jagger because you're a Rolling Stones fan you check out Rock The Zydeco/Atcha first (see the reviews others have left) as it is probably a little more rock and roll than this album. Both however are excellent and if you enjoy eclectic albums with great ensemble playing and well crafted lyrics you could hardly go wrong acquiring this."
1,Find something else,"This is a total piece of garbage. The screen is impossible to see in daylight or at night, with or without the backlighting. Don't waste your time or money on this product."
5,fantastic OEM quality wires,"These wires went on a '94 RWD Toyota Pickup. Having owned many other Toyotas, I know that they are best maintained with good OEM quality parts for the ignition in particular. I have never been let down by any NGK purchase in the past, and these wires were no different. When I found that Amazon carried them, it was a no-brainer to go with them. The '94 truck has a more primitive EFI system compared with newer cars, so the worn wires (and cap and rotor that were also replaced) were causing a lot of stumbling, poor idling, some misfiring, bad gas mileage, and acceleration that wasn't great. Putting on the NGK wires (along with the cap and rotor) makes the truck perform like it is brand new again. The acceleration in particular is simply remarkable."
2,"Outdated design, just can't cut it any more....","This gamepad really would have been great 4 years or so ago. Today, with just four buttons and a design that seems similar to the control pads of the departed 3DO console -- this gamepad doesn't really hold up well.If you need a backup gamepad, this is a consideration. But, I'd recommend spending a few more dollars and get a USB pad with 6 or more buttons (many games now need 6-8 buttons!)."
4,NOCHE APASIONADA!,Paquita es una Dama del bolero del barrio y es por eso que sus canciones estan llenas de lo cotidiano con sabor apasionado.Compre este Disco Compacto si usted esta listo a disfrutar de las grades canciones como las que se cantaban en el Mexico de los anos cuarentas. Disfrutelo!
5,red cellet phone,"I bought this to use for my classic 5th gen IPOD,and it fits perfectly. I can also squeeze my cellphone in it along with the ipod. I would definitelyrecommend it, it fits great,feels soft too."
3,nice but flawed,"I have a sony ericsson with the ear plug on the side, the cell phone pouch is not wide to accommodate the plug-I cut a hole to use. After two uses my phone and ear plugs started shorting out due to all the moisture (I sweat a lot). Also my husband got one as well and has average to large arm circumference and it is too small to fit on upper arm."
3,Tight Fit,"The product itself seems really good, fits my phone snuggly. I could tell as soon as I took it out of package it looked small. It is very tight on my bicep, my arms aren't that big. I know that most men would not fit in this at all. I just wear it on my forearm it still works good."
2,armband case,"The case is well made, but difficult to use. Anytime I want to stop or change anything, I have to take the armband off and take the player out of the armband case. When the phone rings, when the doorbell rings, I first have to take the armband off and then the player out of the armband case."
5,ACE,Besides Dick Gould's classic book on tennis instruction. This is one of the best modern books on modern tennis techniques and tactics that I have come across. I was looking for a book on tennis instruction for a friend and came across this gem. Easy to follow with many illustrations and some pictures and loads of good sound tennis advice. This book serves up an ACE!
2,Great photos...poor text,"While the photo examples in this book are excellent, the text contains grossly innaccurate historicall accounts. In addition, many of the descriptions of the instruments in the photos are also just plain wrong. For the second edition, the authors should either omit all of the text (and make this a picture book) or re-write all of it."
5,"Sexy, sexy video","This is a sexy video! I can't think of anything I dislike about it. All four of these are smoking hot! Especially Brooke! She's my favorite! It really turns me on when they strip down to nothing and continue playing pool. They don't let the hot humid weather stand in their way. My favorite scene is in the end when they go skinny-dipping in the ""cool pool""! I would love to be in the water with them."
4,A singer hiding from an abusive husband finds real love,Singer Sabrina Blue is hiding from her past. She is singing in a nightclub. Guy Latimer comes and heres her sing and tries to sign her to a contract. But fear for her son makes her refuse to size. Guy doesn't like being rejected. He is amazed at the voice of Sabrina and intrigued by her beauty. Sabrina's real name is Deborah. Beauty is more than being slim and attractive. People who aren't slim are also beautiful and seen that way to people but the world newspapers doesn't want people to see that. I enjoyed this book immensely. It is a book you cannot put down. You will be amazed how three romances emerge.
3,Eye Catching,This is a smart little eye-catching calculator. Since it is an HP the quality is undisputed. If you want a scientific calculator without all the bells and wistles this will do. If you are into math this would only be a beginner....
2,good little calculator but hard to read,"I gave 2 stars not because of the feature or price of this caculator but its design. This is a very handy calculator with all scientific and computer science features, unfortunately its bright blue background with black letters is very hard to read. The solar version is silver with black letters is much easier to read. If you like this calculator and think about to buy one, do not buy this one, go to buy the solar version."
3,Compelling Story in an average book,"Even though I'm no critic, I still feel able to judge that this book has a few annoying issues. First, the book feels inorganic, put together like with a box of spare lego blocks. Second, the word usuage and structure, awkward... writing style has nothing to do with this complaint. Lastly, the point of view is messy, the book is almost pseudo experimental, are we talking muti-personalities here ?. What keep me reading this book, what keep me from throwing the book into the recycle bin, is its painfully dark story of how a human who like dirt in a storm was blown apart and then came back together a different soul in an other world. So, if you've got some extra reading time and like these type of books, go for it. Otherwise checkout :First They Killed My Father: A Daughter of Cambodia Remembers (P.S.)."
4,A blesshing over ashes is a good book,"A blesshing over ashes was a good book. This was a story about a boy growing up in Vermont with a camboidian brother. The book was a good story and tought a lessen about meny things. For ex. this taught a lessen about taking things for granted, and not appreciating what one has. Adam Fifield is a good auther and will some day right a new book."
3,All your meds in a container small enough to fit into your purse,"I have to admit, I wish this was a bit smaller. This is mainly because I want it to fit in a smaller purse. My pills are all small, so I could do with a smaller organizer.But the truth is, this does everything it's supposed to. The tray that holds all the meds is a bit flimsy, that's why I'm giving it a 3, but being able to remove the tray all at once makes it much easier to fill. The locking feature also seems to work pretty well."
1,Waste of Time and Money,"The best thing about this self-published book is its table of contents, which are quite provocative. Unfortunately the contents don't deliver. The book seems to be a compendium of Dr. Litten's (a pseudoname and no doctor at that) anecdotes and opinions, supported by suspect-sounding research. There's some interesting information, but altogether not worth the cover price.If you are a guy looking for information on masturbation, there's not much out there, but Cathy Winks _The New Good Vibrations Guide to Sex_ has a good chapter on the subject. But if you're a woman, there's 8 good books by my count on the subject."
2,"Too medical and confusing, NOT for the every day person","The book was not what I expected at all. It had no pictures or drawing. It kept talking about the authors god and his feelings. It was also vary complex, confusing and clinical in every way. It read half like a clinical psych. book and the rest like a list of the authors personal life. I WOULD not buy again or tell some one to buy this book."
3,Solo sex,it is not like the real thing between a man and a woman and it will never be as good and fulfilling emotionally.
3,Starter Set,I am new to turning and purchased this inexpensive set to try simple projects. i have made a couple of items and the set performs as expected based on the price. The small gouge did bend the first time it touched wood. It could have been rookie error but think it is the quality. I will be investigating other products soon.
3,Lathe Knives,"I only gave these a three star, because the quality of the tool is not that good, even for the price. The handles are not smooth, and have chunks missing, the brass colored rings are messy. The box is a nice walnut colored wood, however the top does not close squarely. I buy a fair amount of product from PSI simply because it is a higher quality than other suppliers.They work fine, just disappointed with the finished quality. If I made items of this caliber to sell, they would not sell!"
4,It was good,I like it because i love the felloship. It came with evrything I needed and it came in time for my birthday.
1,"WHAT A POS, STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS","WHAT WAS PANASONIC THINKING WHEN THEY WROTE UP THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL. THEY GIVE YOU TWO CHOICES IN SETTING THE UNIT UP. BOTH INCLUDE A VCR, WELL IT IS 2005, ALMOST 2006 . SOME PEOPLE MIGHT NOT HAVE,OR CARE ABOUT TAPES ANYMORE. SPENT 75 MINUTES ON THE PHONE WITH THEM, AFTER WAITING ON HOLD FOR 20 MINUTES. AND GUESS WHAT, THE UNIT STILL DOESNT WORK CORRECTLY. STAY AWAY , DONT BUY . I AM PRETTY GOOD AT SETTING UP TVS AND STEREOS. AND THIS THING IS A JOKE. AND THE FUNNY PART IS I HAD THERE PREVIOUS VERSION AND IT BLEW UP AND THEY SENT ME THIS. I GUESS THEY THOUGHT THIS WAS PUNISHMENT FOR ALL MY COMPLAINING. YOU WIN PANISONIC...."
4,KNIGHTS KNIGHTS KNIGHTS,THIS BOOK WAS BOUGHT FOR MY SON WHO IS VERY INTO KNIGHTS AND THAT TIME PERIOD. HE LOVED THEM.
1,Exetremely Difficult to Use,"I am a programmer and very familiar with graphics programs, BUTI couldn't figure out how to use this program. Couldn't even open theimages that came with it. An e-mail to the company didn't even get a response. I will be buying a different company's product END"
4,Best software by far,The software that comes with CD Labelmaker far outshines other software like neato/fellowes. The ease with which you can stretch and rotate text and images is very cool. My biggest problem is trying to find white photo glossy labels for CDs...it's a product not even listed on the Memorex website...but i have found in several stores.
1,Terrible software,"Memorex continues to make the worst software for label making. Their new exPressit version 3.0 is incompatable with versions 2.2 and 2.1. In other words if you have many labels made with the other two versions, 3.0 won't open it. This is utterly stupid. When inserting text the font selection has a mind of it's own. This was true in 2.2 and 2.1 and remains the case in the new version 3.0. Quite often the font you've selected will be unavailable and the exPressit software will revert back to basic Arial and you are unable to change it."
1,terrible software,"I am an HTML designer and familiar with a wide variety of authoring and design software...and I had fits with the MEMOREX labelmaker software...just creating a text field made my computer (a pentium 3, windows 98 Dell) lock up...I hated it. I was control/alt/deleting all night... Finally, I uninstalled it and created my own templates in Freehand. This product is a waste of money and a joke. Who the heck developed this software?"
3,ELephander,I dont have this Zoid but my friends do and they have goten the to stand but not much more they dont walk and the stuff like guns a stuff fall of way to easy if i had to rate it i would give it a over all of 3.5 stars
3,i hate this toy,This zoids is to big for me you sould proboly be an advanced zoid buider. the age should 12-21
1,tiny,"when i bought this the box was huge. HUGE. The zoid wasn't hard to buld, but very small. Its weapons are poor. Also the pieces are fragile and snap easily. The guns on its bellt and back are ok, but the trunk get in the line of fire. It has 3 'modes'. First mode as seen on the box has guns on its back and a gripping trunk called Commander type. Second is fighter-type. It still has guns on its back, a diffrent head, huge shield ears, and a shield trunk. Finally the Scouter type with a radar beacon on its back which carries a second pilot, oval radar ears, same head as Fighter-type, and a land radar trunk. Dispite all of the types its still not a reccomended toy. There are better zoids. Don't buy this zoid if the price is more than $15. Its small."
4,An Elephant Armory,"This zoid is a huge monster and it has as many guns as an armory,maybe more. It doesn't hold together really well, as does Buster Eagle. Of course, with such a big armory this makes it really fun to use when you go to battle. Elephander would make an excellent partner, but never rely on him as a leader, because he is extremely big and slow. You'll have fun, so make sure he is on your side when doing battle."
5,Zoid Elefander-Good and Barely Bad,"After looking forward to and receiving the Elefander I put it together without much difficulity. I was surprised to find out that the Elefander did not walk as I thought it would. It seems that it walks in circles and is very unsteady on it's feet. Has anyone else experienced this problem?On the other hand, it has 3 different ends for the trunk, as well as 3 different ears, 2 different tusks and, 2 different types of cockpits. I found out that it had 2 guns that point backwards, which is really awesome. All-in-all it is a really cool Zoid. If I had to rate it from a scale from 1-10 I would give it a 9. It has offered endless hours of enjoyment. I'm looking forward to getting the extra add-ons. THIS ZOID RULES!!!!"
5,zoidwatcher,i think this zoid this zoid is cool.this zoid is used by the backdraft group.it has a 60 millimeter gun and has a shield.it is very strong.
5,The Supreme Elephander,"The biggest zoid in america. The gojulas and iron kong are bigger but lets not get into that. this thing is sweet. espiecally if you add the assault gatling unit at imageanime.com Hey, its worth the [money] to get this thing"
5,Big and Powerful!!!,"A great zoid!! In the series this zoid was called the ultimate X! And guess what? Even in models it still is!!!! All the features in the series are also available in this material. So, if your lookin' for a powerful zoid, this should be very promising!! I highly recommend it!"
5,One Of a Kind,"This is a really cool zoid, you can play with it for hours!it has 3 changing wepons for it trunk...,mine detector, claw,and shield. two wepons for its back...,I don't quite know the name for it yet but it is a Big gun and rotates 360, also a radar that fits somebody inside. three types of ears..., shield ears which extend, really scary pointy ears that are for the commander type head(I will tell you later), and scout ears.also it has two types of heads...first is the commander type head the first head on the show, pointy, next is the regular type head. when it walks its trunk moves alot! it comes with two people. this is a must have zoid!"
2,"Software Architecture hits the basics, but is dated","I was disappointed in that Sofware Architecture focused more on a few specific approaches to systems design than on an adaptive approach for creating architectures.Although published in 1996, I found much of the material to be based on the past (e.g., a pipe and filter model, shared repository, etc.) moreso than on newer/emerging technologies, such as the role of component-based architectures.I think this is a good text for a traditional summary of the SW industry and some solid practices, but it did not offer the foresight needed by ""seasoned"" professionals to earn a permanent spot on the bookshelf."
3,For the fundamental theoretic principles of S/w Architecture,"This is one of the first books which created the whole field of software architecture. This is a theoretic treatise on the fundamentals of software architecture. From that point of view, this book is timeless. However, if you are an industry practitioner with over 4 years of experience, and are looking for the cutting edge software architecture principles (with applications to J2EE, .NET, SAAS(APEX) etc), then this is definitely not the book for you."
2,Barely interesting- nothing new,"This book adds little to our understanding of this period. Yes there were many that opposed Hitler - some in thought, few in deed and almost none in action - over 300,000 people are estimated to have participated actively in the muder of the Jews - including those that sat at desks - those that drew up schedules and those that killed - so there were a few hundred that opposed Hitler after 1933 - and why didn't they succeed - because there were so few and they were fumblers. There were actually millions who opposed Hitler in Germany - they didn't vote for him but after 1933 it was too late. This book lists high ranking officials that made some attempt at plotting against Hitler. But one would barely know the context if one was not familiar with it from prior knowledge.A dull read with little added to our knowledge of why Hitler succeeded in his deeds and why no one stopped him - even when it was too late."
4,Does the job,It is nice for the price. Did what it is suppose to do. Doesn't feel heavy duty thought. Did not expect that at this price. Recommended for medium to light jobs.
3,It was working Ok for about the 10th time.,"after that it wouldnt lock into the down position,, I added a heavier spring, works great.!! .98cents what do you expect?"
5,IT SUCKS solder that is,"Very nice solder sucker. Smooth operation and a good size. I don't know what else to say, it is a simple device and it does what it is supposed to and well."
1,Did not work,"The was a bad item. The product was made of very cheap plastic and on the first uses, the tip melted time it hit the solder."
5,Exquisite!!,"""Elixir"" is an absolute masterpiece from start to finish. The blending of so many different instruments along with beautiful vocals create this Middle Eastern fusion which is beyond belief. This is by far one of the best CD's of my collection (and I have thousands of CD's). The journey begins with ""From Mumbai"" (track one) then climaxes with the title track ""Elixir"", the journey then starts to cool down with the sexy tracks of ""One Good Dub"" and ""The Flow"", just when you think it's over, the last track ""Pachamama"" delivers one final climax. As noted by another reviewer, this music is perfect for whatever you may be doing or if you are simply just chillin and meditating. Definitely a ""must have"" for any lover of truly good music."
5,gret christmas storage,very happy with the snap n' stack storage box. best purchase for this type of use I've made.
1,Flimsy almost unusable,"This ribbon organizer is lighter weight and more flimsy than the ribbon itself!It might work properly if you only have tiny curling ribbon, but the openings are noteven large enough for most of my nice ribbon to fit through.Truly a sad waste of money. Using a cardboard or plain plastic box would be an improvementto this I believe.Just more clutter around the house instead of a way to organize and cut down on clutter."
2,Smaller and flimsier than expected,"I have a 3 level Snap N' Stack Storage by Snapware but since it was full I needed another one. I ordered this one but was not expecting it to be so small and made of thinner and flimsier plastic. There is no way that a typical large glass ball ornament can fit into one of the layers. If you want something like this to organize your ornaments, get the 3 level Storage bin."
2,Storage Containers,"This is a very nice item for storage of SMALL things. When looking at it on the website, the containers appear larger than they are."
1,Pile of junk,This product was a total ripoff. It professed to be storage for Christmas orbaments. The only ornaments that would have fit would have been the size of a marble. It was made of cheap Chinese plastic and the separators were cardboard.
2,Did Not Work for Me!,I was very unhappy with this product. It was made of poor quality plastic and the tiers kept coming apart and everything falling out. Plus it did not hold even medium size ornaments. Very disappointing.
4,Good for a variety of uses,"I use this for storing cards, envelopes, gift wrap tape, scissors, gift tags, and small gift bows. The only complaint I have is that one of the boxes was stretched out a bit from having too much in it, and I have to keep bending it back to get it to snap closed. The good part is that these come in other sets that you can snap to, so I'll just replace it eventually. It holds together well when the boxes aren't overstuffed."
5,Very Funny,My son chose this book because it looked disgusting and it is! It's also very funny and the illustrations are just wild! It's a book any kid aged 8 to 38 would enjoy and certainly one to disgust Grandma with. It's also got some bits of horrible science in it - so you actually learn a little something as well.
1,Book Review,"I bought this book with the intent of using it as a prop for an Xmas game. I realized that this was a used copy, however I thought it still may have some of the scents left in the scratch and sniff areas. I was wrong, better to buy new than to be cheap and buy used, in this instant. Not very please with purchase,Shark"
5,Even if youre an adult....,"For those of us who are adults on the outside but still harbor a piece of ourselves at 5 that remained untouched by maturity will like this book. My curiosity was piqued when it said it was a scratch and sniff book filled with the worst smells. All of the gross items smell the same, but they are all one revolsive smell! Caution: Will Make You Gag!"
1,Bad,"This book had no smell and the pages that did smell just smelled like the sweat page. The facts in the book are nice and the pictures are gross so that is cool, but it is supposed to have smell. Very disapointed."
4,Sunday Times Review,"Four Stars out of Five!D-K's Scratch & Sniff book is reviewed in the children's section of THE SUNDAY TIMES newspaper - 3/9/2000.A word of warning about this book - do not attempt to open it if you have just had your dinner as it's pretty disgusting! As its title suggests, you get to smell some of the worst things imaginable with sections headed Smelly Socks, Dirty Toilets, and Rotten Food. And for those of you who have the stomach to reach the end, you can take the Stinkology Exam to see whether you have been taking in the science behind the smells or just holding your breath. Yuk! Four stars out of a possible five!"
3,Cookies,This is a great product for those who are looking for a tasty meal on the go. They don't really keep you full for several hours. I suggest an appetite suppressant as well. I lost 5 lbs in a week and with a shrunken stomach and decreased food intake I have kept them off for 2 weeks so far. There are better options if you have the time. I got these because I am constantly on the go and don't have time to make small meals like oatmeal or something all day. If you have time for that I recommend it because this is unnecessarily expensive. This was great for a week but I found that eating cookies all day gets old after a while.
4,Delicious meal replacement,"They taste pretty good. I can't attest to the weight loss, but they taste far better than the other cookie diets."
2,Sleek,"The ChameleonThis book is well written but dirty. Once you start reading it, it is hard to put down."
3,Demos.,These are some very well written songs but are clearly demo versions.Even today the REAL KIDS are playing all these songs live.It's a good disc but I would recommend it to fans only.
3,Good Value NAS for IDE Drive,Once firmware was updated the drive worked with Vista PC. I access this drive using XP and Vista from LAN - both work OK. I would recommend this drive if you are looking for NAS using an older IDE drive. Construction is fine. Manual good enough to complete installation without too much difficulty.
2,Not for real witches,"This book was very entertaining and witty and fun to read. HOWEVER if you are a true Wiccan/Witch this book is not for you. It includes spells on how to injure, hurt, kill, and forcible alter people's will. All of these things, in Wicca/Witchcraft, are absolutely against what we practice and against everything we believe. There are things such as impaling a live spider on a pin and boiling it in blood, or oil or something. Of course there are a few helpful, normal spells as well for the real witches who don't want to cause harm or anything negative like that. This book is mostly just fun to read but not helpful if you're looking for a real spell book."
5,Super!,Some of the best decals I have bought for my scooter. Easy to install and look fantastic!I also bought the reflective pin striping as well.
2,Bad for Soymilk,"I recently bought a soy milk maker, while I was browsing for it I found this apparently great deal of Soybeans. At first I was very exited, imagine 10 lbs of soybeans, that sounds great. When the product arrived I realized that the shipping was very expensive, but still a good deal. Then I opened the box which contained 4 bags with 2.5 lbs each. One bag had a rupture, and some soybeans were coming out of the bag.Then the time to make soy milk came. After several attempts to improve the soy milk (I made soy milk about 6 times), every time with a different recipe and always getting a horrible flavor I decided that the milk maker did not work. When I was about to return the soy milk maker a friend suggested to try different soybeans, so I did. And guess what! the soy milk maker works great, its the soybeans that give a horrible flavor to the milk!I would rather buy more expensive beans and be able to drink the milk, than these soybeans that give a bitter, awful flavor."
2,Dissapointed,This product is good qualilty.. I was very dissapointed that I was charge for an extreme amount for shipping and handling. Especially since it said buy both and get free shipping. I think it is dishonest of the Amazon web site to offer Free Super Saver Shipping on items and then turn around and charge an enormous amount for it. It is charged to your credit card and you can't do anything about it. So be careful when you shop here you may not get what you think you are getting.Connie
3,What did Jesus say and what was added afterward?,"Largely about the work of the ""Jesus Project"" to tease out the actual words of Jesus from those added, for various motivations, by early church figures, the book makes me want to read something more substantial in this area, preferably by one of the Project's principals, since this book is too second-hand about it, the author being more a reporter on than a contributor to their work."
3,It's OK but it tries too hard to make its point.,"The book makes a credible case for the abuse of men by women -- and of the stigma attached to admitting such a thing, much like the (mercifully) lessening stigma attached to women bringing charges of sexual harassment or sexual assault. Men who are abused can find a measure of validation in reading the stories of other men who have been abused, and for this alone, the book provides a valuable service. However, in its drive to legitimize its premise, it needlessly minimizes the very real and continuing horror faced by WOMEN who suffer domestic violence and abuse. For this reason, and because the research, although credible, is unsatisfying and mysteriously thin, my review is that of a mild recommendation only. It could have been so much better."
1,misleading conclusions,"Of course we need shelters and support services for battered men.However, what people need to realize is that women's shelters are saving the lives of more men than women. Read my analysis of the government statistics from the US and Canada to see why this is so.(See Counseling Female Offenders and Victims,2001) Women are not murdering men like they were due to the fact that they were killing out of fear. Now they have the shelter option. But men are still hunting them down as before. Also on the battering statistics: these figures include a lot of women slapping men who get fresh with them. Or self defense assaults. So the facts revealed in this book and carried by the media are false."
1,Hurtful and horrifically damaging,"Anyone with any experience in domestic violence knows that the abuser in the situation will immediately claim their partner abused *them*. I work with First Step, a nonprofit organization to help the victims of domestic violence break out of abusive relationships. I have seen abusive men scream that the woman had 'clawed his face' or 'slapped' him. From experience I can say that nine times out of ten this 'abuse' is done out of fear, often when the abuser has the victem pinned against the wall. A case I just assisted on involved a woman who slapped her husband after he had pinned her to a wall. He punched her in the face and broke the woman's nose. He still maintains that he was in the right, and that he was the abused. This is a techinque of power, of making the woman feel guilty and weak. No violence is acceptable, but making the claim that men are abused to a larger extent than women only helps further sterotypes benificial to violent men."
5,"Yep, I was abused...","... by my older sister when a child and adolescent and first gf in college.Since then I have ""merely"" been verbally and psychologically abused by successive gfs.There's a reason I am 34 and unmarried."
5,The New Predjudice,"Every person who is involved with family courts should read this book. My son's story is not told in this book, but the horror of his story is told over and over. I am apalled at the courts' assumption that family violence is always the husband's/father's fault! I will send a copy of this enlightning book to the Guardian Ad Litum who was in charge of my son's case. It should be required reading before someone can be endorsed for that position.Abused Men: The Hidden Side of Domestic Violence"
5,Intimate Violence: The Case of Abused Men,"Philip Cook's Abused Men is well conceived, well documented, and well written; it is an excellent source book for both perpetrators and victims of domestic violence as well as for police officers, community leaders, health care providers, family therapists, crisis-line workers, and other helping professionals. Another positive aspect of this book is Cook's ability to make research findings on male abuse and its consequences accessible and understandable for readers new to the field of domestic violence. The book can serve as an eye opener about the factions, disagreements, and controversy that are part of the issue of domestic violence.Eugen Lupri, Ph.D.Professor Emeritus of SociologyThe University of CalgaryCalgary, AlbertaCanada"
4,Not just about LISREL,"In teaching structural equation modeling in a doctoral-level graduate class, I found Kelloway's book one of the most useful resources. Despite its title, the book is not only about LISREL. The initial chapters provide an excellent overview of the science (and art) of structural equation modeling. Kelloway provides probably a better summary than most other books on the topic."
4,A worthy guide to non-specialists,"If your goal is to use LISREL and apply structural equation modeling to your own work, this is the book for you. Goes over the model and the software in enough detail to handle most of the problems my stats students see, and is clearly written and easy to follow."
4,"Read Some of the Snappiest, Most Hilarious Dialog Ever","Kevin Smith is the master of delivering snappy, intelligent, and HILARIOUS dialog in his films, and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is no exception.The storyline is fairly simple, in a Kevin Smith way: local stoners & sometime dealers Jay and Silent Bob find out there's going to be a movie made about comic book characters based on them, read a few nasty comments about it on the Internet, and decide to trash the movie. Basically, the story is more a vehicle for an homage to the previous Jersey flicks featuring the improbable duo, with appearances by nearly every character from the previous films.That, however, doesn't stop Smith from putting some of the funniest dialog ever into the mouths of all those characters, and reading the screenplay is almost as good as watching the movie so heavily dependent on said dialog is the story (though you miss out on some pretty cute girls!)"
3,Sick humor,"Does this Kevin jerk ever tire of filthy language? His ""movies"" (if they can be called that) are really sick - would be entertaining to a point IF one could discard the filth. These ""movies"" are NOT for human consumption and certainly not for decent minded folks. Watch the grass grow - it is FAR more entertaining."
5,100 Ywears of Strauss,"I first heard Andre Rieu perform on PBS, and was enthralled with his music. It is absolutely beautiful."
3,Hunting Dangerous Game With the Maharaja,"While this book illustrates the majestic colonial days and the hunting wild games in India, it's title is a bit misleading in that it only talks about three or so, not so well known, Maharajas and the writers personal trips to hunt. The perception title created for me was as if I was about to read some prominent and main stream Maharajas of India's tales of hunting (i.e. Nizams, Patiala, Kapurthala, Mysore, Gwaliors and Nawanagar states and so on). With that said it is still a good glimps of good old days of hunting in India."
5,"Great series, when is this going to be a Movie","Love this series. Sometimes this is a fantasy action movie where I wish I was the actor. Sometimes the movies looks dark, but it set the mood for what might happen. I will buy all the series this has to offer."
3,"Easy Read, But Loose Ends","This book was an easy read. However, I felt it had too many loose ends. At the beginning of the book, the heroine is a child and meets the hero, but they never actually address this in the book. He never reconciles the child from years before with the woman. Also, the story is somewhat watered down. I wouldn't necessarily say I disliked the story, I just felt like there was a lot missing."
3,Fundamentally Flawed Examples,"This book offers good solutions, overall. But it's advice is ocasionally flawed fatally. Within the first couple chapters, for example, the authors write all of their examples to call TerminateThread(), which is a fatal and unforgivable mistake that results in nothing more than unstability. Worse, throught the book, they code threads that use the C runtime libraries but start the threads with the CreateThread() API--that causes the runtime libraries to not correctly initialize or shutdown in all cases, and that results in memory leaks and unstability. While the authors clearly treat deadlocks and thread programming models, their implementations are still mortally flawed. A score of 10 for great abstract descriptions plus a score of 1 for terribly poor implementations and samples results in a score of five."
3,Great reference manual if you are still programming NT 3.5,"Beware of this text, despite it's recent publication date of 1996 it only covers Windows NT 3.5 multithread API.If this is what you are looking for then purchase this book!"
5,"review 30301 3 "" cross slide vise","I went thru 2 vise purchases and returns before spending the bucks on this vise. Any of the low end stuff is chi-com junk and is poorly made and has big tolerances making them hard to adjust on a drill press if of course you want accuracy. My ENCO purchase had a frozen jaw, my other purchase was a low end Palmgren made by the chi-coms and weighed 82 lbs, too big and heavy for my Delta drill press. The 30301 Palmgren is USA made, you will know because even the cardboard box is high quality. It is machined to extremely high tolerances and has no gear lash in either direction. It's 25 some pounds and fits nicely on the drill press table. You pay for the close machining but to me it it worth it. I'm sick of chinese crap. And great service from Amazon as always."
4,Great graphic novel,Posy Simmonds does a great job expanding the world of comic books or graphic novels or illustrated novellas or how ever you want to call this good stuff.
2,I had high hopes but was disappointed.,"I would like to say this book opened my eyes and gave me new hope about a possible advantage to bipolar disorder, but that didn't really happen. While I agree with some of the things the author said it felt like the author was manic,grandiose and bragging throughout the book ""see I have this all figured out, look at me do this."". The support group meetings made me wince as I have been to similar meetings led in a circus like manner and I think they cause more harm than good {not support group meetings just circus like meetings.}. I am a long time sufferer and I agree about the creativity and brainstorming issues, but seriously it just seemed like he had limited expierence and conclusions not well thought out. It really seemed like he needed more control and probably more lithium. This is my first bad review and I don't take it lightly I'm just saying do what your doctor says and take everything you read with a grain of salt."
5,The Bipolar Advantage - Tom Wooton,"Being bipolar is such a negative thing in society; always being called out for treatment and mendication. Tom Wooton tells the story from the inside of his mind. He doesn't sugar coat his feelings or perceptions like so many other books on the topic. He's not there to inform the non-bipolar world but to be a peer voice to those who have the disorder. I am not yet through the book but it has been both a page turner, and a book I find hard to put down. Buy it, read it, share it."
5,A Refreshing Perspective,"Just having been diagnosed with bipolar I disorder 3 1/2 years ago, I have found that much of the literature available focuses on the ""how-to"" aspect of dealing with symptoms and problems associated with the illness. This book provides a refreshing look at some of the good things that come along with being bipolar. The book demonstrates the ways in which we are capable of producing more than just chaos and mayhem in our daily lives. Make no mistake, however. The book is very blunt in its description of the disorder. It makes no attempt to ""sugar coat"" the condition. The author describes it as a fate ""worse than death"". This book is worth reading!!!"
3,bipolar advantage,"I found the book not to be as well rounded on the topic of bipolar, but it did bring out some valid points.I appreciate anyone who writes of thier experience with bipolar.I always seem to learn something, even if only a little."
4,Th Bipolar Advantage,I thought the book was very realistic on the illness the way he jumped around from subject to subject and how hewas able to deal with the illness
1,Basic,"This book did not meet my expectations from an educational standpoint. I want facts and solutions, which this book did not offer. It was more of a personal journey. The author elluded several times about his sexual zest. The author also states in the book that he does not beleive in God, yet was a monk for several years. His spiritual aspects were never clearly stated. Which would have made a difference to me if I had known."
3,Read between the lines,"Being bipolar, I actively looked for an uplifting book that would cast a positive light on this devastating disease. This book, however, did not do any of this. Instead, it provides an accurate record of what a manic episode really feels like. This is not described by the author in any explicit detail. Rather, the whole tone and nature of the writing exude the manic energy that the author felt during the very short period that he produced the book."
1,Don't waste your time,"This is a book about an egomaniac who loves to talk about himself. The author rambles on and on about how great he is in bed, how high his IQ is, and how much money he's made. The book seems more like an autobiography of a self-proclaimed ""genius"" than a book that was written to help people and families affected by bipolar disorder. I would not recommend this book to anyone in the world except for Tim Wooton."
4,Bipolar Advantage,"Being bipolar myself I was really intrigued by he title as I have long considered my condition a handicap not a advantage. Tom changed my view of that, the book takes time to really help you see why Tom views Bipolar as being an advantage. I agree with some of the reviews that he is a bit over the top in bigging himself up but I personally don't think it changes the message.The book is full of lots of practical things you can do to enjoy the bipolar advantage."
1,A complete waste of time and money,"This is the most ignorant and poorly written book I have ever read. I only got half way through it and had to put it down. It is brimming with self-aggrandizements, repetitious blather and statements so far-fetched and inaccurate that I was laughing out loud. (The human heart beats out of habit?) Well, so much for the autonomic nervous system.Save your money to buy more lithium."
3,Keep looking,"Sure, it arrived on time, and it was packaged nicely. However, the multi-tap is listed as being for Slim. What we received is not what's pictured and it is not compatible with our PS2 Slim. I'm not bothering to return it because it's a pain to go through all that. However, as you can see by other reviews, and my our experience, it would be best if you purchased from another seller."
4,Finding My Way Home,Life is a constant journey to find ourselves and God's purpose. We live in a culture that measures the value of someone on degrees of success. Nouwen forces us to look from a God centered perspective.
3,Needs a proofreader,"The author or publisher should have proofread this book before publishing.Also, some of the top-performers featured in the book need to familiarize themselves with the National Association of Realtors Code of Ethics. You'd think they would have done that long ago!In spite of its flaws, the book does provide useful information, and some ideas other Realtors can adopt."
5,The Wise Will Read This Book,"You can tell if something is making REAL difference for good by how much opposition it generates. I noticed all the reviews were either five stars or one star-- EXCEPT for the clever one who gave it three stars just to make sure you would read his snide review! Hmmm, very interesting.... The negative reviews are clearly meant to dissuade you from ever reading this excellent book and learning the TRUTH. But the truth is what will set you free.This is one of the most HONEST, personal, AND beautiful experiences you will ever read. Yes, he lost his life shortly after finishing this book, but he left this world with a clear conscience. What more could any of us ask for?I suggest reading this out loud as a family for some great discussion and learning."
2,a learning experience,"Hi,I think the one thing people should try to remember is that the best thing you can do in life is take people where they stand(for who they are).Life is a journey;first and formost,an experience in learning.reading everyones reviews(for and against the book)I can feel the distress from""new agers"" and the feelings of vindication from the ""non-believers"".I think the best thing any of us can do(objectively)is appreciate another persons opinion in it's entirety(without judgement)and learn from anothers perspective.Reading something foreign from your own personal beliefs is always wonderful,because we are all here to learn/evolve,and we all have something to give to the world of ourselves.Even ""new agers"" need to remember that.After all,we are all seeking our way in the world;and we are all seeking to connect.Remember what's important."
1,"Once a fundamentalist purist, always a fundamentalist purist","Please don't waste your money on this book. I'll tell you the story. * Author goes to college and does drugs. Author blames this on Satan. * Author spends entire summers working to go to Yoga Training. Author blames this on Satan. * Author has success in New Age field. Author takes personal credit. He becomes a fundamentalist purist New Ager. * Author gets burnt out and decides needs new religion. Author blames this on Satan but gives Jesus credit for ""cleansing him"". * Author fails initially at being a successful Christian organizer. Author blames this on Satan and self for having hung on to New Age ideas. He becomes a fundamentalist purist Christian. * Author becomes successful ""teaching"" Christians about the supposed lurid details of the New Age. (I guess saying most have FT jobs and families would be boring.) Author takes personal credit for this.BTW, this guy died shortly afterwards at age 33 according to another writeup."
1,For the spiritually bereft,"This author doesn't understand the difference between religion and spirituality. Lacking any spiritual sense, he goes back and forth between two extremes, not seeing the forest for the trees. This unfortunate ""seeker"" finds only blind alleys, and therefore this book is a total waste of time."
1,Hogwash!!!,And paranoia. Typical critique of the New Age movement on the unverified experiences of one person.
5,Extremelly good. A must read for any Christian who wants to know the beliefs of different religions.,"I can't recommend this book enough. This guy was once a New Ager and gives a good testimony. It really helped me know what the New Age religion believes and what it does not. It talks about such things as automatic handwriting, crystal power, UFOs, familiar spirits (known to New Agers as spirit guides) and many other such things. Very fascinating and very educational."
5,BERGAMOT TABACCO CANDLE 60 Hour,"A sophisticated scent for the home and long lasting. It is not really feminine or masculine. I purchased two, one for my boyfriend and one for me."
5,Oustanding!!,This series is one of my favorites and I can watch it over and over again. The entire cast is perfect.
2,2 only because it has lesbian content,"The only reason i kept watching it was because it had lesbian content... other than that it's rather painful viewing. Don't understand why those other people who wrote amazon reviews loved it so much! The lead character is annoying, the script is forced, the sets ugly, the jokes ...heavy sigh. need i go on."
3,"Fun, a little sexy, quirky too; a tamer, less glamerous version of L Word.","These women are more on the real side of L Word; the quality of filming is something less than the big budget L Word, but the story lines are more real. Lifestyle that we can mostly relate to, without the Hollywood non-reality glitz. The actresses are mostly believable, but the couple with the long term commitment is just too sappy and silly. Not enough hot, sexy scenes!! I longed for some of that Hollywood drama!! If you're going to make a ""real"" lesbian community drama, at least make it extreme in one or two situations...and make at least ONE of them a huge problem instead of a loveable annoyance! Get them drunk and show it, get them jealous and show it, if you want to make it real, MAKE IT REAL! All in all, not too bad and a nice diversion series. Maybe there will be a saeason 2 and they will improve on the ""reality"" lesbian theme."
4,A Good Overflow Book for Changeling,"When White Wolf produces a book with a Storytellers screen, the book is filled with information that could not make it into the original edition. The Book of Lost Dreams is fairly good, with crossover rules for the other Storyteller games, and a good adventure to get your group going. Over all a good buy."
2,Not Double Walled Like #6848-000-950 Blend-N-Go was!,"The old #6848-000-950 Blend-N-Go Oster Cup was DOUBLE WALLED to keep your drinks cold but this Cup sweats, is cold on your hands and the shakes/smoothies get warm and melt right away. I am surprised that Oster hasn't improved on the old one that fit all the Oster Blenders while keeping it double walled for insulating value. Come on Oster!"
3,A bit small,"Even though the product description stated the size of the cup, it still surprised me to see how small it is. I guess we must make oversized smoothies at our house. I'd much prefer this if it was twice the capacity. The blade and two rubber rings will be useful with our existing blender jars, even if the cup doesn't make many smoothies."
1,"Lid Leaks, blender gasket is not compatable with drink lid.","Something is amiss in engineering. Gasket does not seal drinking lid and it leaks when used. It appears product has two different gasket sized. It appears lid needs a slimmer gasket then blender adapter. This negates the products convenience. If slimmer gasket is used in blender, gasket gets caught in blade cutter."
3,"Decent, conveniant.","I bought an ""oster blend-n-go"" cup from amazon about 2 years ago it was awesome. When I ordered this one I thought it was the same one.....it isn't. The plastic is thin and very flexible, so it flexes a little bit when blending ice for smoothies. It does a poor job crushing ice compared to my other blend-n-go cup. It doesn't leak, has good measurements, but I wish it was the thicker more durable plastic."
3,"New Wave SF Rules, Ok?","This is a fun crazy book.I don't get why the reviews were so bad. Maybe you need to understand the 70's to get it. If you like punk rock - circa 1977, if you enjoyed LSD, if you think sex is for more than procreation...then you might like this book.New wave SF is about sociology not physics, and maybe that scares the physics nerds out there. But that says more about them than it does about the stories."
2,Not as great as expected,"I bought this product based on all the great reviews. I haven't been impressed with the rice - quick or standard cooked white rice. I have had better rice cooked in much cheaper cookers. The result has improved somewhat over the months - by experimenting with the amount of water added but it shouldn't be this hard. I would not recommend this product over cheaper versions that I have found easier to use, easier to clean and provide a better cooking result."
4,Very nice rice cooker,"This is first time I use Zojirushi. I have been using Panasonic rice cooker for 20 years and I want to make a change. I am really surprise this little unit is really good. Every time when I cook the rice, it turns out perfectly. The only drawback is it takes a little longer than Panasonic to cook rice. It takes about 50-55 minutes to cook a full pot of rice."
3,Perfect Rice but low quality bowl.,"Does the rice up perfectly every time...and it's extremely simple to operate and clean.BUT, the non-stick coating has started coming off the inside of the bowl right at the top of the rice despite ALWAYS using the plastic spatula and cleaning with a non-abrasive sponge. Will have to buy a replacement. Bad idea to eat rice with non-stick coating in it."
4,Excellent,"We have beening used it for a month. So far, we are very happy with it. But it is just kind of small"
4,Works Good,"I value the reviews by others when getting products and this one is no exception..what I wanted was a selection for the brown rice..I was so excited to get it..the first thing I cooked? you guessed it..brown rice. I used the brown rice measurement on the pan and cooked away..well, it came out like sticky rice. I told my husband I may send it back..he said to give another try and use less water. Well, I did use the measurement for the regular rice and the brown rice came out just the way I like it..the grains separated and was able to make my stir-fry..I make rice by the week and added to stir-fries during the week..it is my main staple..so I'm satisfied for now..I have not tried to make a cake or pasta..bottom line, I should have stuck with just a regular rice cooker and not pay so much for it."
1,Great cooker if it worked,"Bought this cooker last Decmeber and it worked great...for eight months. Zojirushi advised me in August to send it to Goodman Appliances in Miami for warranty service. Now it's the end of November. Everytime I call Goodman to inquire I'm told they're waiting for a part. It's a rice cooker, not a nuclear power plant! If they can't fix it in a reasonable time Zojirushi should replace it. Just ordered a Sanyo...done with this kind of poor service."
5,Great Product,"When I recived my Zojirushi NS-TGC10 Micom 5-1/2-cup Rice Cooker and Warmer in Stainles Steel it was like night and day between Zoujirushi and my old rice cooker. The rice comes out evenly every single time. I eat rice almost everyday and it comes out the same everytime. I haven't had time to cook brown rice but will try sometime soon. It cost more than I would have wanted but, you get what you pay for and worth every penny. I've had my last rice cooker for almost ten years and I know my Zoujirushi will out last that easily."
2,Dry Rice,"Have had this unit for over one year. We have rice at least once a week. Cooking white rice with either the slow or fast method, the rice comes out fine. However after about 15 minutes in the warm mode the rice tends to dry out. Looking for another brand."
2,disappoint on it,"Packing is no good and a spot on the product's inside.It seems an used item so make me shame with my best friend. This order to my friend's family as a gift so we all disappoint on the item.Fortunately, we got a replacement in soon.Anyway, hope u improve ur quality control. Thanks!"
2,NOT Stainless Steel,"The cooking pot of this unit is NOT stainless steel. The ""stainless steel"" mentioned in the description is of the OUTER cladding. If you bought a ""stainless steel"" cooking pot, one would expect the cooking surface of the pot to be stainless steel, as that is what most people expect to pay more for. I really could care less what the outer color is, white plastic wipes off just fine."
1,An hour to cook rice! Who needs this.,Got this as a gift but it's going right back. Who needs a rice-cooker that takesan hour to cook white rice. Give me a break!
2,"Before you buy, ask if you need it.","I have been cooking rice since my youth. Half rice and half water will always yield perfect rice, if you like soft rice. 2/3 rice and 1/3 water will yield rice more firm. Boil the water, let it sit and use low flame for 20 minites to cook it well done.See you do not need high tech cooker. In that regard, this cooker is a complete waste of money. If you like convenience, buy a $30 one. That will do perfect job.I bought because my friend told me great things about it. AFter I tried it, his claims are all unfound. Bottom line, it is a rice cooker with high price, that is it.High tech, high hype."
5,Amazing product,Moving away from instant rice has never been easier. I love my rice cooker. Easy to use. Easy to clean. Amazingly healthy alternative with very little effort!
5,Best Rice Cooker Ever Used,I bought this rice cook to update an old Panasonic. It's stylish. I don't like a clustered countertop. But I love to display this cute little machine on my countertop. The rice it cooks is just yummy. Even my never-cooking hubby can use it.
3,"Whoops, where are my favorites?","If you are fond of great, eerie mid-60s production (with a bit of schmaltz) - this a fun one to have. Most of my favorite Honeycombs tunes are NOT here. Their version of ""Something I've Got To Tell You"" (also recorded by Glenda Collins) is far superior and incredibly creepy, but it's not on this collection. Also, a fantasic early single called ""This Year, Next Year"" with spooky guitars isn't here. But, there are some interesting tunes nonetheless - Love In Tokyo, Is It Because, That's The Way, and She's Too Way Out (hilariously weird) are all pretty good. If you think that you may dig this from the clips you hear, you might consider searching for better collections on auction sites."
5,Mac Racks Surfboard Triple Wall Mount,"Very satisfied. Easy to install, strong, looks great. I chose to install the 2 support bases that attach to the wall 3 feet apart instead of the 4 feet recommended. This way I can also hung my son's buggie."
5,A local musician with the talent of a star,"I feel this Cd is as good as anything put out by either Kenny G or Boney James. I think in no time he will skyrocket up the charts and we will all be saying that I knew him when he played in local venues. His smooth jazz sound is just the sound that has stirred an interest in contemporary jazz in recent years. My only criticism is that I am wearing out my Sleepless Nights CD, waiting for his second release to come out. Anyway if you want to spend a romantic night with your lady, start a fire inthe fireplace, light some candles and set the background music with Sleepless Nights, because the title says it all!"
5,Great help for the blind,I got this for my mother who is legally blind and she loves it. It is easy to use and great for her as she can't see any of her clocks. She likes that it tells her the time and the date and day. Very nice product.
5,SIMPLE & AMAZING,This clock is fabulous for macular degeneration sufferers. Only one large button on top means not having to feel around for the right button. Mom can finally KNOW what day it is and what time it is without having to ask someone. THANK YOU FOR A SIMPLE & AMAZING CLOCK !!
5,Talking Atomic Alarm,"This is an outstanding clock! Not only does it talk, but it automatically resets itself for Daylight Savings Time! We have three of them!"
1,Brad Pitt a Poor Reader,"Buy the other, the All The Pretty Horses alone, with reader Muller (sp?) Frank. Brad Pitt does a very poor job, and I was amazed how poor. He hardly seems like a trained actor. He badly mispronounces Spanish (pronounces 'jefe' as 'jeffy')and his reading is like something a grade-school child would produce. He carries the question tone over to the 'he said' in interrogative sentences and does not change voice tone from one speaker to another. He sounds like a slacker who has been forced to read a high-school composition. This guy is an actor?And the abridgement ruins the stories in all three novels.Now I have to go back and buy the other because I love ATPH very much and want to hear it read by someone who has had voice training and a good voice."
3,Doesn't support Quickbooks Transaction import!,"I got this because I use PayPal and Quicken doesn't support importing QIF files, and I thought it would be useful to get on Quickbooks anyway. PayPal does support the exporting of Quickbooks format (iif I think) - so I figure this would be perfect.However, Overly Simple Start doesn't support this basic, simple task of importing data from anywhere, in any format. You are stuck typing in every transaction... And if you are getting a lot of payments on PayPal, this will cost you TONS and TONS of time.I don't think that this goes for other versions of Quickbooks, and it did look like I might be able to ""use"" the software - if I didn't mind spending hours entering data.. And I don't know if I can later export that to the real version of Quickbooks when I need to...I paid $99 for this, and the only good thing I can say about the purcahse is that it can be written off as a business expense... :-("
1,Does not install in Windows 7,"I was looking for an inexpensive QuickBooks program that would install in Windows 7. This one did not. Service from the seller was great, but the program did not install with Windows 7."
3,long live the campers,"Interesting album for camperphiles. Great addition for anyone wishing to round out their collection. The album gives an insight into a live cvb performance with the standout track for me being all her favourite fruit(orchestral version). The sounds of violin etc are great to have back, missing for much of the time on Cracker. (No hidden tracks on this one!) Probably not the best example for new listeners, I would recommend ""key lime pie"" for anyone interested in getting on board!"
4,Like being 20 again,"It's nice to hear something new from CVB (it's been almost a decade since Key Lime Pie.) This new disc offers primarily stuff you won't have heard before, including a wonderful All Her Favourite Fruit played with an orchestra, Who are the Brain Police? (sounding strangely non Chadbourne-ish) and others. For fans it's a must. For everyone else it's a chance to hear a band who was never afraid to try new things (nothing clears a room faster than a polka) or poke fun at the status quo.No, not Status Quo, the band. Status quo, the expression. Buy this disc if you're a son of the chief of police, or a trout swimming upstream."
4,Great tone,"I was sceptic when i picked this up at a local music store, but i needed a guitar for cheap and it was on sale... so when i brought it back to my dorm, it amazed me that the tone was so rich in the bridge pickups, i can't say the same for the middle and neck though, they pretty much suck"
5,gor bosox,I got exactly what I expected. Seem sturdy enough and they look cute on. I get lots of people take note.
3,batavia in the 19th century,"thanks for an old nostalgia book. i was expecting to see more parts of batavia, but this book only concentrates on the old chinatown and does not show other parts of the city."
4,minor piece glitch.,As i previous owner of a chess table by Drueke iwas not suprised to find the set and board an example of fine quality .The only negatives are: the set is slightly larger than need be for the size of the squares on the board. This is easily forgiven onceyou've played over a few games. The second is that the bottom of two pieces is not flat. This causes a slight tilt in thses pieces-1 rook 1 knight. It appears the weights were not inserted properly or the hole for the weights was too shallow. All in all a fine product at a reasonable price.
3,"Good information, but it desperatly needs to be organized!!","There was a lot of good information about cooking ahead in this book, but there is no organization to it what so ever. If you want to look up, for instance, if you can freeze a certain food or not, you can't , there's no index. I can't believe it got past the publisher in that condition. Also, there were a lot of personal stories about her life, some of which were interesting and pertained to the issue, but a lot just didn't have anything to do with cooking or freezing in bulk. I didn't find the recipes very tasty, my children don't really enjoy casseroles, and that's about all there was in it. I think with some organization and order and less stories and better recipes this could be a much better book, and I do like her household tips, they just need to be in some kind of order and you shouldn't have to read through pages of stories about her life to read them."
1,"Should have been called ""Everything BUT How to Cook""","A lot of personal anecdotes interspersed with information about cooking in bulk to freeze. The main purpose of this book is to convert the reader to evangelical Christianity. I found a fair amount of useful information, and was surprised that there are general household tips as well as marriage and family philosophy in addition to the cooking information. The information concerning actual bulk cooking constitutes about one tenth of the book; you have to read amazing amounts of irrelevant text to get to information the title would lead one to believe the book contains."
2,"Accurate Title: ""The World According to Jill Bond""","First of all, I'm a Christian, so my criticism of Mrs. Bond's book is not an attack on her beliefs. I thought I was buying a book on freezing dinners. Instead, I got a book that covers everything from her ideas on recycling and homeschooling to anecdotes about her stay in Panama. While these insights into Mrs. Bond's world may be of interest to some, the title of her book is misleading. The recipes are lackluster and there is very little information about what kind of foods freeze best, etc. Its definitely NOT a primer on getting dinner in the freezer. Nevertheless, there are some good tips and if you are looking for a Christian home management program, this may be your book. The author needs to rewrite a consise book on getting dinner in the freezer or retitle this one."
2,"Disappointed, and glad I didn't pay full price","I bought this book at a local Christian Bookstore, at 40% off. I am glad that I did not have to pay full price! Recipes didn't start until Chapter 16.The first 15 consisted of her personal ""journey"" and why she thinks what she does and why you should too. An example being why you should investigate a food co-op, because people that aren't Christians might run it. (Oh, Horrors!!)While I think everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and that some of the material will be of obvious merit to me, the entire tone of the book is one of suspicion and fear. I could hear the yells of ""red sympathicizer"" and ""commie"" as undertones, ala Joe McCarthy.I think that writing a book that touts to be about food, and large quantity cooking, and instead using the book as a platform to stir up more unrest, is criminal. Jesus said to love our brothers and sisters, not to murder them, or their good intentions, in His name."
3,3 out of 18 chapters are about freezing food!,"I'd say about 3 of the 18 chapters are actually about freezing food. I also agree with other reviewers when I say that most of the book is about her personal beliefs. She is very ""godly"" in her book, which is fine, but I can definitely see how some unassuming atheist would get bent out of shape over it. What she DOES say about freezing is great. I really like her charts, but you have to be very organized to reap the benefits. The best advice I can give you from the book (and you won't have to pay for it) is: when you're cooking a meal, just triple the recipe and freeze the remainder. Well how about that? Ha!"
3,Good book if you can get past the sermon,"I did like this book overall but I do wish that it hadnt been so preachy..I was left feeling after I read the book that if I wasnt ""christian"" I couldnt really undertstand the need of preparing meals ahead of time. I'm glad that I borrowed it from the library before I bought it though..Overall I did like the ideas and charts."
5,Family Fun!,This game is pure fun! We have a busy family life with not much free time. I do like trivia and learning new things so I bought it. Our 16 year old played with my husband and I. It was the first time in a while we all had a good time together. The game is challanging and moves quickly. Everyone is playing at every turn so there is no boredom. The subjects are so interesting that you end up discussing them during each move. This is a great game and I hope it gets the recognition it deserves!
1,Boredom,"Up front, this is one of the most dry and boring techical texts that I have ever read. Reading the book is as interesting as reading your insurance policy. I had (as part of a class that I was taking) to read the book cover to cover and can definitely say that this was a hard experience. The book uses very few examples and for the most part, they are useless. They do not carry a point nor explain any of the material they cover. The material is arranges in a confused way and does not flow from one chapter to another, nor does the structure of the chapters make any sense.The reason I give this book 2 stars is that is does cover the various areas that SQA is concerned with. Going over the table of contents would give you enough information to look somewhere else for a better text."
2,Shallow and unsubstantial,"In a book entitled ""New Black Man,"" one would expect a cultural critic such as Mark Anthony Neal, a professor at Duke University, to do a lot more than merely reference rap videos and pulp fiction as evidence of how Black American men think. Unfortunately, he doesn't. He is no Gunnar Myrdal, and his assessments of the alleged sexism, ethnic chauvinism and homophobia of black men are largely based on hearsay. This is not to say that black American men aren't frequently sexist, chauvinist or homophobic, or want to dominate their girlfriends/spouses. But Neal does not, in any concrete fashion, analyze the dynamics behind such appalling behavior on the part of certain black men. He just gives us a bunch of attitude, and as such, the book falls flat on its face."
2,Not worth it,"Right now, my logitech wingman wheel is collecting dust. The reason? It performs way under par. It feels nothing like an arcade wheel at all. The FF is out of sync, leaving me with little choice but to turn it off. I have not compared this wheel to other wheels yet because I am detered from buying another wheel after using this one. I also hate how you can't turn the wheel left/right after spinning it 90 degrees. I keep hitting that steering edge and it limits my turning on many of my games."
1,wont work on Chevy,I purchased this scanner and was sutprised to have it fail to link up with my 2003 Impala. I went to the quto parts store and their scanner worked fine reading the codes
5,jo's reviews,"Everyone who likes to diy, should have this. easy instruction book, and has easy to read dital screen.I save time and money on my old chevy and dodge pickup. I look up the trouble codes in the book that areeasy to follow, before i take the them to the repair shop."
1,Does not work with Volvo 05,"I plugged it in my car and follow the direction and all it did was an error and failed to read the ECU. The thing it self is cheap in design, it has mircowave buttons and slow load times."
4,Good but missing current protocol,"I've had this unit for a few years and its worked with my 2003 Mazda MPV. We sold the MPV and bought a 2007 Toyota Sienna and this unit won't work with the Sienna.Apparently there is a newer OBDII protocol called CAN (Controller Area Network) which my U380 does not support.Otherwise, a good very basic unit. Nothing fancy and the interface is a bit clunky but it did the job and pulled the codes."
1,DOA,"Unit could not link to a 2008 Mazda, despite claiming that it could. The plug in socket was such a tight fit that I ended up breaking the receiving end off under the dashboard. Thanks to this doorstop, I now have two problems with my car. I have returned the unit, and may I suggest that there are better choices."
3,Caution does not work on all cars.,Before buying this tool check to see if it is compatible with your car. I bought this tool for my 2005 Buick and it works but it does not work for my 2005 Chrysler.
5,A MUST HAVE,"OBD 2, EOBD 2 Volkswagen / Audi / VW Auto ScannerIT IS SO EASY TO USE. RECOMMENED TO EVERYBODY."
1,instruction manual,"i just recieved my u380 obd11. it has a pretty color. that,s about all. my manual was written by someone that has been outsourced from another country. does not make any connection. i keep getting ""linking error"" can anyone help on this. good connection, 2006 chevy hhr. please give an old man a little instruction. can,t seem to find and tech help locations on this. thanks b. crawford."
4,Good product.,I'm satisfied with this product. Straight forward and easy to use instruction makes this ideal for the novice DIY er. Gets the job done.
1,Did not work !!!!,"First off, I tried to read as much about this scanner as possible before buying it. Well let me start off by saying that I have a 1996 Dodge Ram1500. I tried to run this test a few times with the same result each time. (n\a) Their should be a list of vehicles that don't work. When reading some of the reviews, there were some other people that this scanner did not work on also. It would be very helpful to have a list of vehicles that did not work with this scanner."
2,Not the best,7 out of the 25 disks would not write. I didnt much care for the product considering this factor.
1,Absolute Garbage,First three in a row did not pass the data verification process. Trying to burn video results in dropped data somewhere in the middle of the burn. Tried two different computers. Same result. DON'T BUY THIS JUNK!!!
1,Not reliable,"I use a Panasonic EZ28K dvd recorder. These discs seem to work ok until they reach the switchover to the 2nd layer, then they corrupt and some have actually erased. I had never had a problem with Verbatim DL discs."
4,"Some errors, but not many coasters.","At this point, I've used about 75 of these discs for burning. They are fairly good. On occasion, I've run across an error prior to the burn. However if I put that disc to the side and try it again later, it will usually work the second time. I can't say why, but that seems to be the way it is.So far, I've only come across one which wouldn't finish the writing process. One coaster out of 75 discs is a fairly good return rate. They also retain the ink very well when printing on the discs. (I use an Epson Stylus Photo R220.)"
5,Works Well,It worked well for me I was able to burn a homemade dvd about 2hr long and this product worked very well.
3,Ridata Double Layer 8.5GB DVD+R 2.4X Inkjet Printable in 25 piece cakebox,burn at 1x..or can get coasters
5,"Aggressive , dark and in my face!",After hearing this band...I knew I had to have this CD. Thischick is scary and fierce. Metal with a splash ofgoth/industrial...very cool.
4,Works but gets gluey,"This works and will stop those lashes and brows from falling out from dryness and your lashes will grow if they can, but the bottle gets glooped up about halfway down; so, you end up wasting about a third of the bottle when you get tired of trying to fish out some of the product with their little brush. However, it does work and I have purchased it a number of times."
4,it works,actually this was a gift from my sister i didn't follow the instructions. i actually apply it when ever i feel like it including before bed time. i am using this product for over a week and i am noticing a very big difference in my lashes length. the only problem is that my right eye respond more clearly than the other one but i think this is only me not the product.
5,doesn't burn.....,"I have so many allergies, I was afraid I might have a reaction but I haven't. I'm not sure how well it's working,yet, though. But my lashes aren't dry and falling out any longer."
2,Mavala Eye-Lite,"I used this product for 3 weeks, but can't see much difference. I do think it may be a great conditioner, but for the price, I think I like the Double Lash and Brow by Godefroy much better and it's half the price!"
4,It works!,"It works on my Asia black eyelashes. Odourless & Colourless. Just some tips from my humble experience: Apply only at the roots generously, dun overdo it by applying it several times a day/week (it can cause lashes to drop/weaken). Happy lashes days ahead!"
3,The product,"The shipping of the product was fine. The product itself is a ""3"" for me. I think my lashes are softer, but not lengthy. I have been using this for one month."
2,not sure,I have not seen any results yet so i am not sure if it is too early or not. Right now I would not get it again.
1,Waiste of your money,I would not try this product. I bought it and it did not work. If you want results Revitalash works. I will be trying the other recommended product soon and will give you the results.
5,It Works!,"I would have never believed the Mavala Eye-Lite Double Lash would work, but it really does. It works well on lashes and eyebrows. I recommend you buy it!"
1,Horse Tissue Extract ?!?,"A fine moment in animal cruelty at the hands of the beauty industry. I would rather embrace my short, light lashes as a statement of natural beauty. Ahimsa ~<3"
4,Thank you Nathaniel Bartlett,I am not comfortable writing reviews. Just wanted to take a moment and thank Nathaniel Bartlett for recording -Precipice- It's been a while since I got this CD. There are some CDs that are like new toys... When you get over the newness you never play with them again. I find that I still reach for this SACD in the quiet hours.Opening is my favoriteThank you
5,"""Opening"" a masterpiece","While the other pieces have their appeal - I'd say for a smaller, more astute musical audience - it's the opening track, ""Opening"" by Philip Glass, which is a true revelation and lasting pleasure. And capable of broader appeal. It, alone, is worth buying this CD.Bartlett's mallets and the sonorous tones he gets from his marimba bring new insights and, for me, a deeper interest in the piece. His dynamic range and subtle approach to tempo variations make repeated listenings possible, and in the end it's a dynamic performance.Although the mood of ""Opening"" may seem melancholic or wistful to some (tho to me it's a feeling of ""openings, the pulsing forward of events when you have excitement tempered by past loss or nostalgia""), take it as a meditation and master-class example of Glass' modern masterpiece. I'll bet you probably will be surprised at how the range of the marimba can be extended to favorably compete with a piano's interpretation."
1,Pure Right Wing Christian Islamophobia,"Archconservative, Protestant, Christian Hammond (see [...] expresses the dark side of everything other than his brand of Christianity - which tends to see ""the other"" as the work of Satan. His book ""Slavery ....."" feeds Islamophobia much as such archconservative Christians feed homophobia. I cannot locate any accredited university that uses his writings. I strongly suspect that similar books could be written about Christianity, Judaism, humanism, etc. --- all of which have radical, extremist, and militant movements. For reliable presentations of various schools of thought, world religions, etc. it's far more prudent to stick university based faculty. For example, [...] is trustworthy, as is [...] a center for the study of Islam. Hammond's book has sold well; there is a hungry market among anti-intellectual archconservatives - religious and political."
5,A great basic vegan recipe book for beginners and beyond.,This was my first vegan cookbook. I have made many of the recipes with great flavor and edibility. I have found fresh lemon juice is the best. You can easily cut the recipes in half for 1 or 2 person households.
4,Not exactly what I expected,"The recipes are probably fine but so far I haven't tried them but did read through the entire book. I have ordered quite a few vegetarian books lately and this is one I was a bit disappointed in. I grew up in NY and do miss deli food! I have practically all of her cookbooks and resold this one. As I added later in a post, I ordered another book ""The Lowfat Jewish Vegetarian Cookbook"" and just preferred it. I do have limited space in my rv so I have to be very selective on what I keep and what I resell."
2,Works well but a little deceptive,"My father bought this as a suggested add-on to the Amazon Kindle - and I suspect a lot of other customers but this product the same sort of way. What they don't tell you is that you need to buy two things - the power adapter AND an ""iGo Power Tip for Amazon Kindle"". With the extra cost ($12) we felt we were both deceived and cheated. Particularly because the picture for the iGo Autopower power adapter includes a picture of the Power Tip (not actually included). But we were determined to make it all work and after an extra trip to an electronics store it now does. Overall I was impressed by the product but beware of what you are really getting."
4,Good product,"I've tried several brands of double layer DVDs. These are better than most and the price is reasonable. I've had little problems with these disks. I have run across the occasional bad disk, but rarely. Verbatim is the best, but Verbatim is also a lot more expensive."
1,Stick With Verbatim,"This is my second purchase of the Ridata double layer DVD package. In the first package, four of twenty-five were duds. In the second package, six of twenty-one (four still remaining) had to be thrown away. My fault? Unlikely since I had virtually no problems with Verbatim disks. Considering that about one in four Ridata disks had to be discarded, Verbatim disks are a better bargain cost-wise and technically."
1,100% failure,"I have tried these on 3 different computers. I have not yet found one on which they will work. Mine say 4X, so maybe they are not identical."
1,Stick with Verbatim #2,"I bought these before the one-star review titled ""Stick with Verbatim"" had been posted, but I've had a similar experience. When you copy something onto a DVD, you don't want to find out 6 months later that the data was lost. I've had even worse luck than the 1 in 4 of the previous rater. And I have also had much better experiences with Verbatim."
2,"Loved Mr. Ripley film, not the author","Although my husband thinks it is about the weirdest, creepiest movie in the world, I loved the film The Talented Mr. Ripley, but knew nothing of the author. So when I stumbled upon her books I excitedly purchased two; this collection of short stories and Strangers on a Train. Big mistake. I personally do not care for her writing which to me is uninspired and flat. Granted she has an admirably twisted mind, something I like in an author but not a friend, but was extremely disappointed in the books. This collection of short stories was actually boring to me and I gave the books away."
1,Get an editor PLEASE!!,"This could be one of the worst books EVER written about baseball. It's a shame paper was wasted printing this book. Although her writing isn't bad, it's FAR from good. A decent editor could chop this crap in half, if not more.It appears that the author my have been a little too close to her subjects. One should not let their personal life effect their work. This book should receive ZERO stars."
2,Outdated,This book was published in 1998 and it shows. I expected a bit more engineering but this is more like a technical overview. It is strange that it introduces formulae with very little explanation.
4,Video Engneer,The book was in excellent condition and is very detailed in its explanation of techncial terms. It is very easy to understand.
3,A confusing read,"As a fan of Kathryn Smith, I'm sorry to say that this is not her best work. Upon finishing the novel it seemed as if several plot points had been left unresolved and those that had been concluded, were done so in a manner that seemed to contradict the behaviour of the characters throughout the novel, or were completely implausible. If you can look past this however, A Seductive Offer is a pleasant enough read."
3,Ok toothbrush holder,"I really like the way this item looks, but the lid pops off when you remove your toothbrush, especially if you have a curved or non standard toothbrush."
4,Good Overview or Review,"This book is working great as a review source for studying Italian. I'm learning Italian at home and started with a couple other books that are pretty good. Then I started this book a couple months in to my studies and it has been a great source for reviewing. It has excellent descriptions of grammar and useful exercises (although their are a few typos in the answer section - just an editing problem that's pretty obvious).I'm not sure if I would recommend this as a sole source for your Italian studies as it does cram alot in to a little space, but definitely get it for a back up for tough concepts along with some audio lessons (Plimseur is working well for me)"
3,Excellent basic self study guide,Lebano is a very good self study guide. The exercies are comprehensive and challenging and answers are provided. I would give it higher marks if it had a decent index. If you learn everything in this one book you will have a solid basic knowledge of Italian.
3,"Good, if you have prior knowledge of a Romance Language","This book was helpful for me after having learned (to some extent) French and Spanish. I found that the grammar and vocabulary were very similar, however, I do not think that Lèbano explained some tenses very clearly and I do not agree with the order in which he chose to introduce grammar points (eg--putting the cart before the horse)."
4,Learning Italian,Easy to read. Nicely organized. It would be improved by the addition of a companion CD for pronunciation.
5,Excellent self-teaching Italian language book,"I have been attempting to teach myself Italian for the past several months. I tried a few software products, but while those help me with pronunciation, this book provides me with the tools I need to understand the complexities of the language, e.g., verb conjugation, etc., something that the language software just doesn't explain very well. I would recommend this book to anyone who is trying to learn Italian."
5,Excellent Self Instruction Level book,"I found this book to be very clear and well organized. It ""flowed"" in the proper manner to allow one to build upon knowledge gained from previous chapters. I believe that this book would be a welcome addition to anyone's Italian self instruction book collection."
4,Excellent primer for Web TV novices,This book is very helpful for anyone new to Web TV. I found the step-by-step examples were just what I needed to gain confidence and skill. The authors really take you by the hand and guide you. Perfect for the internetphobic. Well worth the investment and also quite useful as a reference book.
3,Alright...,"Bloodline I will admit was a page turner, but Mina...just no you can't do that. If you read Dracula you might be a little dissapointed this book could never in a million years live up to Bram Stroker's Dracula. Just like all classic things they are better left WITHOUT! sequals like the ever famous classic romance vampire novel Dracula."
4,Shaken not stirred,"These glasses are pretty elegant. I have brought other products from the Waterford-Mondavi line and was impressed with the quality. I found these on sale right here a Amazon for far less than the Macy's price. (50.00? I don't think so!) They are crystal and take me and my fertile imagination to a sophisticated bar long elegant black gloves, diamond bracelet. Jazz and a mysterious stranger. Oh yeah back to the review!Nice size however though I own bar equipment I have never made a martini.I can see a lemon peel or a large cocktail olive dancing in my magic elixir. Although I would never spend top dollar for these. They are nice looking and don't look cheap."
5,Elegant and nice feel,I bought these glasses for my hubby last year for X-Mas and he loves them. They have a nice weight and are a bit bigger than the average martini glass. Thought about getting more...but will wait for another sale!
4,reacquaintance with waxman,"i honestly don't know why i bought this cd. but there is a great deal to love about it. the main thing i love is the first suite, which is highlighted by an arrangement of his 'elegy for strings' for piano trio.the second surprise is the witty set of variations on 'auld lang syne'.the third is the price--very affordable and not a disappointment."
2,Developing Major Gifts,"The person that had this used book prior to me had a very shaking hand. In ballpoint pen, the person underlined many portions of the first half of the book. The lines are wavy, along with the frequency of the lines make the content hard on the eyes.The content is ok. So far I have read 10+ pages, no new information. I guess that is what you get when you buy a used, 10+ year old book."
1,My 5 year old and I both hated this book!,"I couldn't believe the good reviews! This book has no story to speak of, only creepy, dark pictures. The children look like strange little adults and the ""pets"" look like monstrous beasts from a child's worst nightmare. Yes, the book has a dreamlike quality to it, but more nightmarish than anything else...not a good choice as a bedtime story as the images are disturbing and unfriendly. At least this was my opinion. My son (who is not hyper-sensitive)did not like it either. But if your child likes really weird artwork and is not easily spooked then he or she may find this book just the thing."
5,I dont have enough good things to say,"This is such a wonderful book. Though I bought it with barely any knowledge of Burma or George Orwell, but it sparked an interest in both subjects for me. This book is a travelougue, biography, ethnography, history, and just a beautiful story all in one. Larkin has a smooth, easy to read style. I read this book for the first time over a year ago and I still think about it almost every day. This is by far the best book I've ever read."
5,A brilliant juxtaposition of Orwell and Burmese life,"I'm married to a Burmese woman and go to Burma frequently to visit. I'd say Emma Larkin has captured the soul and struggles of that country perfectly in herFinding George Orwell in Burma. She juxtaposes the daily life of average Burmese with the Orwellian government. She uses some of Orwell's most famous works, includingBurmese Days: A Novel,Animal Farm and 1984, and1984 (Signet Classics)as metaphors for life and politics under Burma's colonial, socialist, and present military governments. The analogy fits like a glove. If you've been to Burma, read this book to understand what you might not have seen on the tourist routes. If you haven't been to Burma,Finding George Orwell in Burmais the next best thing."
1,"Basic, slow and little captivating","It s success probably originates from the lack of reading material on Burma as a whole. It is neither insightful neither passionate in describing the local atmosphere, nor Orwell experience there.You kind of have the feeling of somebody talking about something simply he does not understand nor he has experiencedThe art of hearing heartbeats is a different story but a much better reading, by far"
4,"Travelogue, History, & Literary Biography, Concise & Beautiful","In 300 pages the author manages to give a lyrical description of travel through Burma/Myanmar, describe the political situation there now, detail some history of Burma under British rule, and draw insights into George Orwell's work and life in relation to his experience there. Soon I will reread Orwell and be grateful to Larkin for the nudge to revisit his work armed with new perspective as a result of this book. The only complaint I have is that the book has no index."
5,Compelling human rights story,"This is a very nicely written book. It does a number of interesting things. First, it is interesting as a travel memoir. Second, it paints very interesting parallels between George Orwell's descriptions of totalitarian regimes and his experiences in Burma and finally, it tells the important story of the human rights abuses of the military junta in Myanmar.The nightmare in Burma continues. Even as I type this, protesters are on the streets, likely to face prison for their bravery."
3,Finding Orwell?,I downloaded the book on the Kindle and read it while in Myanmar 2013. I was expecting more of a historical account of Burma during Orwell's time and about his family's connection to the country. The book uses Orwell's writing to describe some of that period but mostly focuses on modern political history. I was disappointed that documented conversations with those people who lived and remembered Burma before the current regime did not include more historical information about pre 1950 history. Its easy to read and recommended for anyone travelling to the country who is interested in the current state of affairs (although its a bit out of date even with the 2011 update). While in Myanmar I purchased Burmese Days and saw copies of 1984 and Animal Farm sold on the streets.
4,It works!,"The Post-E Vac is easy to use and does work. I suggest using it along with a E.D. medication. The only difficulty is getting the rings on the Post-E Vac tube. Other than that, if you use as directeed, it works fine."
5,Fantastic,"I have tried this product and think it is fantastic I wish I had bought it sooner. I just wish my insurance would have paid for it, but even though they didn't I still am so glad I bought it. It works like it says and I am getting fantastic results."
3,Pos T,"Works as advertized. Have only used twice, so far. It does seem as if the support ring is a little too snug. Need one size up. Also probably need a little more practice."
2,PosTvac is not for everyone.,It didn't work for me. Sure it can give you an erection. But it wasn't natural feeling and I could not make it work for me. Guess it's not for everyone.
4,Lower body sculpt,"The Firm LBS2 is led by Libby, a master instructer but I find this to be very easy and at times boring. I work out 6-7 times a week and I felt this was rather slow. This is definatly for beginners."
3,For small as a toothpick arms is all wrong,"Maybe Amazon, and/or the seller has changed the description by now, but the wording that says/said that the strap is made for someone with the arm width of a tooth pick (...up to a boa constrictor) is all wrong. The strap is the size of any other similar model iPod jacket, and it's just to large too 'hold-in-place' for someone with a tiny arm width."
5,Great gift for new parents--it sure was for us,"This book will touch your life if you have kids and can use a good laugh. We got it as a shower gift along with another really funny book called, ""Stop and Smell the Asphalt."" Both books are fantastic. We got a lot of stuff for the baby, but these two books were the best gifts we received, because they touch the heart, made us laugh and really helped us appreciate our new roles in the world. Hey, parenting is a touch into eternity, you know..."
5,This a must read for serious Bible students,"Behold Yeshua! Come and see... opened my heart and mind and soul to the beauty of GOD's WORD... Every Chapter, every Verse, every Word, every Letter... even the *spaces* between the Letters bring Glory to our LORD and SAVIOUR, YESHUA HaMASCHIACH!"
1,cheap,"16 dollars? they should be 5 dollars, totally cheap and plastic. i know you get what you pay for but seriously they're not even worth 10 dollars."
5,Excellent book on Civil War in the Trans-Mississippi,"Mr. Edwards has collected excerpts from letters, diaries, newspapers, Official Reports, and other eyewitness accounts to document more than 100 hostile actions in the Indian Territory during the Late Unpleasantness. His ""Introduction"" is the best summary of the war in the Indian Territory that I've read in a long time. This book belongs in the library of any serious student of the Civil War and will be a ""great read"" for those who are only casually interested."
4,"Great Watch, Attention Getter......","I have been looking at this watch both on the internet and at a Macys for about a year and finally decided to purchase it. Its a great watch and I love it but it is not a watch for those who want to got incomunicato. It is ostentatious and draws attention, make no bones about it. It is flashy and that better be what you want. That being said it is obviously a quality item and in no way looks cheap or vulgar. The pictures leave some question as to what the less polished parts of the band actually look like. They have a subtle pattern to them, very nice. Those spots are not the dull unpolished style that is popular in some watches today, there is a pattern to those spots. I cannot make this clear enough. It is a heavy watch but that is no suprise due to quality craftmenship. If you like a well made quality timepiece with some flash, this is your watch"
3,Great DVD player if it would have kept working,"I got this and it surprised me at how well it worked... I attached it to the head rests with the straps it came with and I was set.. at night it looked like built in DVD players in the head rests from outside..but 10 or 11 months later.... and it just stopped working!!! The sound works but no picture on either LCD... : (I was gonna buy another as I thought my kids broke it, but after reading the reviews... it's obviously a manufacturers defect.. too bad...at under $150, debating on getting another, cause when it did work, it did everything it needed to do."
1,Broken in 9 months,"I bought this thinking it was one of the ""better"" DVD players out there, but I was dead wrong. It worked fine until now 9 months later, the screen won't show anything but the sound works fine. And surprise, surprise the manufacturer warranty is only 90 days. That's absurd! No more audiovox for me!"
2,Audiovox Portable DVD,The whole process was fine then when I opened up and turned on the unit for the first time I saw a dead pixel. Rather than return the item I guess I will just have to live with it. My Guess is it was never tested.
5,Love it!,"Love the double screens, this was the best investment that we have made in a long time.The great thing about this DVD player is that you can use it anywhere - hook it to the TV, use it in the car, or just in the house for an extra player when two kids are fighting over what move to watch!Glad we bought it."
2,Dissapointing,"The battery does not work in the hanging position, so you don't have the option to have battery power in the car, so every time you stop for gas or turn off the car for a second, you have to restart the DVD and find where you left off. Very annoying. Also, the way that the cords attach makes too many cords hanging around the car, compared with other sets where the two monitors attach with one USB cord for power and video. The hanging bag for the main player doesn't work for our compact car, it will only hang in such a way that the buttons are right at our two-year-old's feet, and it can't be adjusted any higher, so this machine is not working out for us."
1,Broken in 10 months,"We purchased this player almost a year ago. It worked up until it's 10th month in which the mechanical part that moves the eye broke. We fixed it by shimming the part. It worked for a day and broke again. We will take one more try at fixing it, but after paying over $100 less than a year ago, we feel cheated."
1,Terrible Product,I bought this dvd player less than 7 months ago and it's already not working. And of course it is no longer under warranty. We've only used it a hand-full of times and now it will not read the disks. I stongly recommend not purchasing this and looking at other brands on the market. I am very dissappointed at the durability of this player and classify it as junk.
2,noisy playback,"When I first opened this product and tested disks, every single one of them had the same problem: when the disk spun up, it rattled like crazy. It was hard to hear the audio of the movie over the constant noise from the disk rattling around in there. Bummer because there are so few that I've found with dual screens and batteries! Comment if you know any better ones!Thanks."
2,Did not work,This product worked the first time I used it and 2 weeks later it stopped. The screen said no disk when I put a dvd in. I've sent it back to audiovox to have it repaired no response yet. Also the picture quality isn't that great. Make sure and keep the original packaging if you don't have it adorama camera will not give you a refund!
4,cute book for learning body parts,"This is a sweet book about body parts comparing them to different things, like how baby eyes shine like stars. To wrap up the story the mommy tells her baby ""I Love You, Baby, from Head to Toe"" The text is simple with just a few words per page and the illustrations are soft and enjoyable. My son, who is 1, enjoyed this and it helped us talk about body parts, which he is learning right now."
3,Ok but not great,"Somehow I missed the fact that this video is only 10 minutes long. For the price, I expected more. I expected something like a documentary. And the quality of the video is not great. On the plus side, you do get some excellent views of the impressive falls - but somehow the video overall falls short."
3,"Ah, so this is what a single is.","Luckily this CD's price isn't as high as a normal CD's.With only 3 songs on it(and some other trivial stuff), the Pokemon World CD isn't something you'll listen to often. But with the fact that they included the Pikachu's Winter Vacation(an EXTREMELY hard to find video) song on there, I HAD to get it. They also have an instrumental version of the song, with a nice saxophone solo.The Pokemon World song is on the CD too. In my opinion, this is the worst Pokemon theme song ever produced by 4Kids. The lyrics even seem like a big commercial! Its obvious that the Japanese version of the season two theme is far superior.Either way, you can get this CD for cheap from just about anywhere, and that'd make sense, since this only has 3 songs(One being almost unlistenable). And if you're interested in hearing the theme song of the Pokemon video you've most likely never seen before, then you should get this CD. The song's not half-bad either."
2,This CD was not as good as I expected.,"I don't really have much to say about Pokemon World. The CD is okay. The only thing I liked on it was Pokemon World. I didn't like Pikachu's Winter Vacation at all. I would give this CD two stars because of the 2 songs not being very good. Compared to the other two Pokemon soundtracks, it could've done better except for Pokemon World. I definitely think they did a great job on that one. The rest was so-so."
2,Only 3 songs?,Ok. I thought that this C.D would be like the 2BA Master C.D. I thought they'd have a Newer Version of the All New T.V Series. ONLY 3 SONGS?* PikaJane isn't happy *
4,A Great CD,"I think this is a great CD. While not as long as the last one. It has three good songs and was worth the money (what am I talking about, I got it for Christmas.... but it's still worth the [money]. The first song, is a longer version of the second theme song from the TV series (now that they are in Johto they have a new theme song). The second one is the song Pikachu's Winter Vacation from the christmas release video of the same name. The third one is Pikachu's Winter Vacation (Instrumental). They do add a few instruments to this version, but in my opinion, it makes it more interesting."
2,Could be Better...,Back To Alvin's Future is the best of the bunch as it is a tribute to Ross Sr. Where the boys go back to 1957 to convince Alvin of the 50s to stick with music. Clyde Crashcup was brought back as the kooky inventer.We Shrunk the Adults was good but The Name change for Mrs. Miller was wierd to hear.Bigger was not one of my favorites as Alvin sounded like he did when he was smaller.. Besides how many talking chipmunks are there in the human populace... It did not seem to work for me...Paramount ought to go back and release theriginal 80s series... Go to the movies format is what did the series in.
3,Immune Support Formula,"Although I did not get a flu shot and was exposed frequently to flu & colds I did not get sick this past winter. I rarely missed my daily dose of the Immune Support Formula. However there was a big problem - Several of the capsules (as many as 14 in one bottle) were broken, cracked or torn apart and the formula was all over all the remaining intact capsules."
3,Weil Nutritional Immune formula,I must have received a defective shipment as there were multiple capsules that were broken open. This resulted in the rest of the capsules being covered in a powder like substance. I have used this product before with no problems so it must have been a bad batch.
2,OK,"This soundtrack was alright. The best song is Nev-ah, but other than that the songs arn't that great. I would hesitate to buy this cd if i had another chance."
5,Tres Bon,"It's such a pity this singer passed on, he had so much to give the world, very sad, but at least he left the best of him, his voice."
5,An Angel touched my Heart,An amazing voice talking from the true Heart of a human being gone far too fast. I hope this fantastic Angel is singing for the Angels up there now!
2,Not very good,"I own his first solo album (Je Deviens Moi (New Version)), which i bought while in Paris last year after hearing him sing on French TV in the Hotel. That CD is pretty good, or at least the first 6 tracks are.This new CD (La Voix d'Un Ange) is nowhere near as good as that one, not that the first was excellent, anyway.If you don't know this guy, then don't bother buying this CD. The arrangements are OK. The melodies are not very catchy, with the exception of the famous cover versions. His rendition of Con Te Partiro' is average: that song is too difficult for him - he should have left it to Sarah Brightman and Andrea Bocelli. The thing that turned me off about this album is that there are 2 or 3 parts where he misses his key...oh well."
5,great toy for my 1 year old,My 1 year old daughter loves this toy. When you open the crocodile's mouth it makes music or growls. She loves the sounds and loves to put the blocks in and out of his mouth. Highly recommend this toy!
2,Why did I rent this movie??,"Somehow the trailer got me to rent this film. I suppose if you were out of gas, had no cell phone, and you were stuck at a campsite in the woods, and help was not due to arrive for a day or so, watching this would be better that doing NOTHING. Bu it is sooooo boring I started skipping ahead half way through hoping there was some excitement, some action or SOMETHING.There are many, many films to buy or rent that should be on your list above this one."
2,Driving Bass Ackwards,"I know it is a road movie, but there is way too many shots of just driving for long periods. Other than that, there is not a plot. If you watch the DVD extras, you find that is the case. They made it up as they went along."
3,Double toe straightener,I feel that the toe straightener could be a little less flexible on the sole as it does not remain in place at all times.
3,Pedifix Double-Toe Straightener #P57,"I bought this for my mother who has problem with her toes crossing, which this helps but it would be a better product if there was a gel pad in the middle of the pad as it tends to rub there."
2,Seemed like a good idea....,"I recently found myself w/hammer toes from wearing shoes too small (my left foot is smaller than my right). I now know I have to buy for the right and the left is fine w/a little extra room. Since I'm replacing all of my shoes with a bigger size, I thought my toes would relax into the gap but they didn't. I ordered the Pediflix but I couldn't get it to stay in place at all. I'm just taping my toes together now, when necessary, w/moleskin. I still think my toes may relax but this product didn't do what I hoped. They did have fast shipping though and I might order another product sometime in the future."
1,Bunches up under foot,I wore it several partial days and had to take it off each time. It balls up under my foot and causes more discomfort than I have without it
3,mixed feelings,"It is comfortable, but, the skin under the pad was so water logged that I was afraid to continue wearing it."
2,No Effect,"I purchased two of the double-toe straighteners to straighten my second toe on both feet. They are slightly comfortable at best, but in order to straighten the toe you have to get the straighteners pretty tight, which in turn causes discomfort in both toes.Since using I've noticed no change in the overall straightness of my toes. I can only assume that any results that achieved from the straighteners will be temporary. They're cheap enough to where it is not a huge loss if they don't work."
3,worn-out too fast,"my toes have been giving trouble for a few years now. i'm guessing from not wearing the proper shoe size and/or enough toe space. out of desperation i decided to try this particular brand. i honestly did not expect them (i bought two) to help much, but they did. the elastic strap that you pull taught to straighten your toe really worked. the reason i gave only three stars is that after 3 days of use the pads started to disintergrate. another 3 days and the strap will brake loose. i'm thinking of making my own toe straightener but using a more durable pad; like carpeting or leather maybe!"
1,Not worth $7 - look elsewhere for a solution,"These are garbage. I would have given ""no stars"" if that was possible. I've worn twice. After the first wearing, the fabric (on the pad) was severely ripped from wearing. Almost as if I'd played basketball, soccer, and field hockey in them. Additionally, the actual shape of the pad doesn't make any sense in relation to the shape of the foot."
2,This may be a better fit for someone else,It is not taking care of what I needed it for. But that is what you get when you can't take the time to hold in your hand.
1,Toe straightener,I hate this product because I compared to the one I purchased from the podiatrist.The one from the Dr I could wash by hand & it stayed to gether.This one made a great presentation in it's packaging & yet when I wash it in the sink waterin a little lingerie soap it fell apart.
1,double toe straightener,Tried this on elastic on both toes moved so wasn't directly over joint where it needed to be to keep my toe down and tried walking and bottom pad moved about wasn't stable for my needs.
2,cuts off circulation,"In order to straighten my toes out, I have to really tighten the loops around the toes, which in effect causes the circulation to be cut off. My toes are only mildly crooked."
1,i threw mine away,Doesnt really do anything- you cant wear it in your shoes. It is very uncomfortable to wear even in your house. I think it was made for a $1 but sold at 500% profit. I would give it 0 stars.
4,Pediflex toe sraightener,I have used this straightener before. It has adjustable elastic so it may be adjusted for comfort. It does provide padding for the bottom of the foot. It fits best in athletic shoes because toe width is wider there.
2,Disappointed,"Purchased for an older relative who found this one too difficult to manipulate and adjust. She does have some difficulty using her hands for precise movements, so the item may work fine for people who do not have her challenges with dexterity and strength. It appears to be reasonably well made."
3,works ok,This doesnt have enough space under your foot.When you use both toes. The pedifix for one toe is better. See in picture how your big toe is sitting off the pedifix. It needs to have it cusions the big toe to. It is uncomfortable
5,Double toe straightener,"Trying to lose weight, I had increased my walking to 45 minutes every day and with increased walking I experienced pain on the ball of my foot. When I went to see a podiatrist, he identified a ""hammer"" toe on my right foot. He explained that a hammer toe causes the increased stress on the ball of my foot. With the use of the straigtener, I no longer experience the pain on the bottom of my foot. I have two that I use alternately, each one every other day."
5,It works!,"This is just what I have been looking for - a crooked toe may not seem like much of a problem, but it hurt and woke me up at night. With this little item, I have no pain and sleep like a baby!"
2,MY PROBLEM,"This product was exactly what I expected it to be. Unfortunately, it did not work for me. I have a size 14 shoe . There is enough elastic to hold both toes, but the base which is supposed to hold the toes in place slipped and twisted on my toes.The idea still sounds good to me , but one size fits all is a problem. Maybe it would work for a smaller foot."
1,Worst Product Ever.,"This product is worthless. If you make them tight enough, they cut the circulation off and your toes turn purple... If they aren't tight enough, your toes are still crooked. These aren't worth any money and any foot doctor that ""recommends"" these awful pieces of junk shouldn't be allowed to practice. Awful. Don't even try them."
1,Crooked,"I bought this to see if I could straighten a slightly crooked toe and ended up with a very, very sore foot after just one day of wearing it. I'll keep the crooked toe. At least it wasn't painful."
4,pedifix double-toe straightner,"My doctor wanted me to wear these for some time. I've had plantar fascitiis and metatarsalgia with the 2nd and 3rd metatarsal overloading. The product can be very uncomfortable the first couple of times, you've got to play with it. If your shoe is too tight, loosen it up a bit as well as the bands on the straightner. It gets more comfortable with time and I do feel some improvement along with all the other excercises my doc told me to do."
3,Pedifix Double-Toe,The product works good. My last shipment had 2 defective pads where the foam and fabric layers seperated after less than 1 day of wear. Usually this problem does not happen.
2,didn't work for my toes,"This is not the product's fault, but the product did not work on my foot. I have tried everything for it, including surgery and it did not work but probably would for most people. The transaction was outstanding and there was nothing wrong with the product, it is my foot that is the problem. Recommend for other people. Lois Leonard"
4,Good fit for a stem neck position!,"Mounted it right in front to keep my cell phone, which it barely can handle an iphone, but still works. I like it, it looks cool, a touch larger it would have been more functional, but either way, it's cool looking!"
5,Great little camera bag for bike,"My husband got this for his camera to mount on his bike. He wanted it handy and the clip mount works very well on his handlebar - the camera is on and off in a flash. The bag is well padded and well made but the dimensions in the listing must be for interior dimensions - anyway it isn't quite as big as they advertise. He simply trimmed away the divider wall inside and gained enough space for his Panasonic DMC TZ-4 camera (not a super compact camera, has 10X optical zoom so it's somewhat thicker than a 3-5X optical zoom camera). That modification gained him enough space for the camera. It's a nice bag and he really liked it and wanted it to work and it does! Will easily fit a flip phone and, most likely, a super compact camera."
5,A big topic of discussion,"I sat on a plane recently reading this gripping book, and the man next to me said, ""I've read that--you can't put it down."" We talked about Signorile for quite some time. Then someone in back of us jumped into the conversation. This same thing happened to me recently while I was on the beach reading the book. A lot of gay men are talking about Life Outside and the issues it raises, and that's a good thing. The author just hits on things in a way that is uncanny. It's not that he says anything you don't know. It's that he says it when no one else will, and he defines it in a way that you recognize, and you think ""Oh yeah!"" It's really a gift. He shakes you up and makes you flesh things out. I disagreed with some of it and even got angry a couple of times. That's a successful book."
1,Mindless drivel from a Chelsea clone wannabe,"Signorile chronically proves himself to be a tabloid gossip columnist who aspires to be perceived as an academic. Unfortunately, he just isn't smart enough, and his 'dissertations' read more like an eighth-grade language arts essay. One gets the feeling Signorile doesn't read or listen to others much - he spouts trite received opinion as though he finds his words profound."
2,Only One Good Match!,"The Battle RoyalAt WrestleMaina 2, several NFL football players decided to see if they could hold their own with the WWE Superstars in a Battle Royal. The likes of William ""Refrigerator"" Perry, Bill Fralic and Russ Francis did an admirable job, but in the end it was the master of the Battle Royal that came out on top - WWE Hall of Famer, Andre The Giant."
3,WM II. REVIEW!,"For the second annual event, the WWF took its premier event to three different locations- New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles.Highlights of this event included a steel cage match between Hulk Hogan and King Kong Bundy, an NFL vs. WWF battle royal, a boxing match between Mr. T and Roddy Piper, and the interesting WM debut of the phenominal Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts.Not exactly the best Wrestlemania but it is definetly worth checking out just for the sake of seeing some of your old favorites."
3,"Kind of in the middle PPV, but it does have Dynamite Kid!","WrestleMania 2. Live from three different locations. If you think that that is an extremely stupid idea, well, I can't argue with ya'. This event is actually a little better than WrestleMania I, but it still isn't ""knock you off your feet"" good. It's just, good. Maybe OK. It would have been better if the original plan of Bret Hart vs. Ricky Steamboat went down. But then again, Hogan was facing King Kong Bundy in the main event anyway, so maybe not (Jesus H. Christ that was a horrendous match!). But this PPV does have Dynamite Kid, who F'n RULZ! If you have never seen this guy, then don't talk to me (like you would anyways). This guy is so far ahead of his time it's scary. This is a very mildly recommended PPV, but don't expect to be stupified or anything."
3,"Not the best WrestleMania, but it had its moments","I don't have this version of WM 2, I have the Coliseum video version, which has all of the matches, none clipped, but it cuts all out all of the entrances except for the battle royal, and all of the interviews except for Piper and Mr.T. The event itself is okay, with the tag title match the best match. Hogan/Bundy doesn't have the drama as other WM main events, but the match is okay. The ending of the battle royal is great, with Andre kicking Neidhart out, then throwing Bret off of the top rope and into Neidhart. Everything else kinda drags along, but itwould get a a lot better with WM 3."
4,A BIG STEP TOWARDS THE BIG DADDY,"This was a big step over the first wrestlemania. Making a big specticle and production by having it in 3 cities and lots of starssome matches were slow like the boxing match , but the Piper prematch interview completley makes up for it. and Jake roberts vs. George Wells isnt gonna bring u out of your seat. But the all the title matches are done well. except figure out why one of the ring attendece keeps Bruti from making the save in the tag match. other matches like Uncle Emler and Adrian Adonis are fun even if not classics. Alsot he Battle Royal is a classic. Pay perticular attention to the great sell Brett Hart does when he goes in for the sholder block."
3,New Judy CD!,This cd is GREAT. If you are a Judy fanatic you will love this cd. All of these songs are avaliable in other cds though.If you are a budding fan this is a great package of songs. Personally I love ALL of the songs in this cd. If you have other cds with these songs it's not worth it. The sound is great. I HOPE EVERYONE THAT BUYS THIS CD ENJOYS IT. Bye.
5,Perfect for understanding Scoliosis,"This book was given to me as I was getting my scoliosis brace when I was 11 years old. It was perfect! It explained everything to me about what scoliosis is, and why it was important for me to wear my scoliosis brace. It was because of this book that I was compliant and wore the brace the prescribed hours for two years. Due to my compliance I never had to get corrective surgery. I would recommend this to any child or parent of a child who is recently diagnosed with scoliosis."
5,my son's first dbz toy,"Durable, good height, 2 sets of hands, great toy but the 1 and only problem is it can't do a kame hame ha but still my son's favorite toy so far is this goku/kakorat."
1,Gave me terrible stomach cramps.,"I was so looking forward to taking this for my arthritic back. When I took it, it soon started giving me stomach cramps. I will not be buying this again, and I just threw what I had away."
4,Good fights,"I would say the DVD is worth getting for the Vovchanchyn VS Kerr match. This was the beginning of Kerr's fall from grace, before this everyone thought him untouchable."
1,Poor Quality Collars,"The company is great. Shipped quickly. Price point was great. I would never buy another ARROW shirt. I wore it once, washed it...the collar puckered. I could see that happening on a cheap shirt..but these shirts are normally in the $30 range. It lived up to the name wrinkle-free, tho.I bought 2, wore and washed 1...sent both shirts back. It's hard to find a good shirt with collars that won't pucker after washing."
3,"June 24, 98 ~ Nippon Budokan Tokyo, Japan","This DVD contains an early Pride event, PrideFC 3. Obviously, MMA has evolved quite a bit since this event over 10 years ago. And this era of MMA, sometimes referred to as NHB(No Holds Barred) back then, had already done a big metamorphasis since the UFC debuted in 1993.For this particular event, most matches are ok except for Sakuraba/Newton, which is quite a scientific display of smooth groundwork. Bas Rutten is on commentary along with ""The Fight Professor"".Although the whole Pride organization no longer exist, you can still enjoy its legacy through DVD's such as these. In fact, rather than getting this DVD, I would recommend getting the Pride Legacy Vol 1 box set which contains Pride 1-5."
5,Getting back to the Best,"With the release of this single ( and I recommend getting the Maxi-Single ) R.E.M. is definitely getting back to the music that made them one of the greatest bands in the last decade or so.The Great Beyond has all the qualities that made many of the tracks on Green, Out of Time and Automatic special. It appears to be complex lyrically, but upon closer inspection has beautiful images and glimpses into Andy's life. On the maxi it is a pleasure to hear Everybody Hurts and in particular The One I Love performed live in the UK.I believe that R.E.M. have a great song here. Get it."
5,Classic Anime,"Classic Anime. A very good mix of humor, intrigue, fight scenes, and a very good plot."
4,I want that bounty money,"Everybody wants Vash the Stampede captured. He has the biggest bounty $60,000,000,000. But nobody can catch him cause Vash is not a human he's a plant same goes for his brother name Knives he's the bad guy who sent all his menions to kill Vash at least try. Vash doesn't seem like a tough guy he's crazy about women, he's too goofy and silly and he love's doughnuts. At times he can be serious when it comes to fighting. The world on this show is in the future with a desert planet that looks like the wild west. I don't know how anybody can survive with out plants and the sun shinning all the time. This show should have been named ""Vash the Stampede"" instead of ""Trigun"" cause Vashes name is so big."
5,"Trigun, that's all I gotta say.","Buy this. If you don't already have this series in some form, make sure you support this release so that Funimation will give Badlands Rumble the treatment it deserves. We must have all of the original cast return to dub it! Please funimation, you are the best so show it!Update: I've found a site with an article basically saying that Vash is the only character who MAY have the original voice in the movie. It's already been dubbed, therefore your purchase won't affect their decision at all. They clearly care more about money than the fans. Funimation, I'm grateful for your quality dvds, however you are slapping a lot of people in the face, as this series is special to many people,and hearing your typical FUNI voices coming out of these characters mouths is going to be like a punch to the gut. Sadly, I'll still buy it though, because I want to see it and I love Trigun. Just get Johnny Bosch for god's sake!"
3,"Decent story, but TOO LOUD","I read all the reviews and was really looking forward to watching this. To be honest, I have not been able to tolerate more than one episode (barely made it through that) - the soundtrack is TOO LOUD. It may be tolerable to teen- and twenty-something males, but neither my husband nor I could stand the loud music, and we had trouble with the speech (fast, and mixed lower than the music). Animation is also wanting - simple crablike scuttling instead of walking..."
5,Trigun (a hero mistaken),"Trigun is about Vash the stampede a donut loving, reckless, goofy, idiotic, sharp shooting, 131 yr old humanoid typhoon with a 60,000,000,000 double dollar bounty on his head. Vash is searching for his twin brother Knives who killed killed almost all the crew of their ship on the seeds project and was responsible for Rev's death also. Rev was the one who looked after Knives and Vash while on their ship and took care of them. But Knives read up on human history and found them to be inferior so now Vash is searching for Knives to stop him from destroying the world. The people who accompany Vash on his journey are Wolfwood(priest), Milly(insurance agent), and Meryl(insurance agent). I think Trigun is the best anime ever made for its comedy, action, and it keeps you at the edge of your seat."
5,Perfect,This Video collection of trigub was exactly what i wanted and exactly what i needed. The Condition was perfect and its cheaper then the older version of it
5,For any fan or anime lover: this is it,"Hello,If you're here, you probably love the Trigun series. If you are considering buying it or not, for $20-30, it's very worth it. I love this series and the reproduction -from Funimation is it?- is very good quality. There aren't really any extra features. The box art is nicely done and each CD features a 6 shooter chamber with a decreasing number of bullets as the CDs -4 CDs: numbered 1,2,3 and 4- come closer to the final episodes (it's a very nice touch). Also, the CDs are capable of playing via comp as well as other devices, so no worry there. Oh and if you're excited about getting this set a.s.a.p. it's not worth the extra cash for expedited shipping. I paid $8 I think, for a quick delivery and it still came just as fast... if not slower than the free shipping. Merely my experience, it may not be a universal phenomenon.So, this is a great series, at a great price, of great quality, with fun box art and neat CDs. I highly recommend it!Sincerely,BC :D"
4,Awesome!,"I was so happy when I heard about this release! I've been waiting for a release of the full collection and was about to start checking out dvd import sites. Then when I got my hands on it at the store & saw that it was picked up by funimation I got really concerned since funimation has the occasional tendancy of wrecking up properties they buy up... coughcoughDragonballGTcoughcough.gladly I was surprised that I could not tell any difference between these episodes and the versions I watched years ago. The picture is great! the audio is great! I love the goofy lighthearted packaging as well.I was expecting to see some special features though... music videos for the opening/closing credits, an interview or two, maybe even a trailer for the upcoming release of Trigun: Badlands Rumble or something.Anyways I was more than pleased with this purchase!"
2,Trigun = Not as good as everyone says,"Ok, this anime was really good when it first started out. I bought the first dvd, and I really enjoyed it. The first few episodes didn't take anything too seriously, and you didn't want to gag from some overly acted ""romance"" scene. Before I could buy the rest of the DVD's which I had originally planned I saw that they were showing this on Cartoon Network. I was happy about that becuase it gave me a chance to actually review this anime before I payed the $$$$ on the box set. After about 6 or 7 episodes it started to get really serious and repetitve. It was really unbalanced probably the most unbalanced anime I have seen. Vash has a whole bunch of problems and he doesn't want to ""kill"" anyone. This anime could have been alot more better. Maybe I am just thinking too much into it. ...."
1,WAAAAAY OVERPRICED,"why so expensive for such a mediocre anime i mean it was good but not THAT good the best episodes were the first 4 they were hilarious. the rest of the show was kinda ok not realy all that exciting and the animation was not that good in comparison to Bebop, any of the Gundams(except SD man that show sucks), Outlaw Star, Hellsing, Evangelion. the animation in this show got down right crappy sometimes like when there were explosions and guys were getting blasted away it looked like paper cut outs were getting blown away and the explosions were like 3 unblended colors. it just isn't half as good as the other shows i purchased in the past for sometimes over less than half the price."
5,Donuts for everyone,"I'm not going to go into reviewing this series per say because it seems to be covered well enough and....personal views very greatly.That said, I was really excited when I heard this collected set was being released and waited to pick one up. I've always liked Trigun not for any specific or anime geek-technical reasons. I simply remember this as being one of the shows I would catch every other episode or so on Cartoon Network late at night. It would help interest me into exploring further into anime titles. So Trigun has a special place in my heart....plus my hodgepodge mix of original and re-mix DVDs were showing their age. There isn;t really anything ""extra"" here if you already have a complete collection of re-mix disks. But I didn't and now I have a 5.1 disks with this. Cool."
5,reliable,"I was very pleased with the shopping time, it arrived sooner than expected. The packaging was also very good so my product remained unharmed!"
5,Knock-Down-Flat Out Amazing,"It took me just over a week to finish this 26 episode masterpiece and it was just that, a masterpiece. This breaks into my top 3 favorite anime series' as no.2 (number 1 being Cowboy Bebop and 3 being Hellsing). It is the story of an outlaw with 60 billion double-dollars on his head who is referred to as Vash the Stampede, Vash, or the ""Humanoid Typhoon"". But he really isn't bad at all. He just has a bad reputation because trouble follows him everywhere. He is joined by Millie and Meryl who are insurance reps. who want to get money from him for all the property he destroyed. Of course not intentionally. His evil brother Knives also follows him everywhere and tries to kill him. But Vash doesn't want to kill because Rem wouldn't have liked that. (you have to see the show to get what I'm talking about).P.S. - As far as content is concerned, this anime is relatively clean except for some sort-of offensive language, tense moments, and some very mild gore."
5,My Favorite Anime Of All Time,"I can't think of a single bad thing to say about this series. It is the perfect blend of action, comedy, and drama. Not only is it laugh out loud hilarious, it also can be dark and serious. Not to mention having Nicholas D. Wolfwood, THE coolest character in the history of the world, ever. The release of this box set is really a blessing, since there are eight dvds in the series and collecting them individually is a pain. I realize trying to convince you to buy over a hundred dollars worth of anime on my recomendation is ubsurd, so I suggest that you rent the first three dvds. If your not hooked buy then, you probably just don't like anime in general.P.S. I tried to watch a few episodes dubbed, but I couldn't take it. Please go with the subtitles"
4,Warning for all,"Just letting everyone know to be careful because some of the sellers for Trigun are advertising the complete box set, but that is a misadvertisement."
5,Triguns truth,"The truth about this action packed anime series is that you can really get into the series so easily it's not even funny!It has just what I like about anime.It's special in its own way;there was nothing like it exactly.One of a kind.It can't be just explained in words really,you'd have to see it for yourself."
4,Vash Rocks,"I'm not through the whole series yet, but this show is awesome! My order came in after only a few days of ordering and appears to be in good shape. The reason for the 4 instead of 5 stars is because one of the discs has a weird discoloration on the bottom and until I watch it I won't know if it affects the play."
2,...Not a fan,"almost totally non lethal , very cheesy at times and a uneventful ending .the best part is the church death scene it's touching but i would suggest just borrowing from a friend ...serious."
5,"Vash the Stampede, biggest badass of anime.","This is one of my favorite animes (fallowing evangelion and cowboy beebop) of all time. It is funny and light hearted, while finding away to get serious every now and than. Vash is one of the best anime heroes, he is very carefree and wants peace in the world, but he is constanly finding himslef in very compromising situations, with comic results. I got the 3 dvd version and it was just fine, the picture and sound were not messed up, and for people who dont want to spend $...+ for 26 episodes I recomend it. Those who were complaning about the quality just need to be less picky"
2,Great Anime...Iffy box set,I'm not going to go into the details of the show...this Anime is Great.This particular box set is kinda crappy though.I should have known since it was only 24 bucks.the case is fine 4 DVDs in 2 thin cases. the problem is the video quality sucks.the colors are faded and it looks like I'm watching it through wax paper.not only that but there is more than a couple spots where DVD starts to skip and seems to be unreadable for a few seconds.if your picky I'd pass on this one and get a better copy.funimation should fire the ppl that put this set together.
1,pathetic,"It's an o.k anime, but compared to Evangelion and Lain it's pathetic. It is basically about some fool who eats donoughts and walks around causes destruction while two people follow him and ""clean it up"". The protaganist is an excellant marksman and yet he never fires a gun until episode 5, which is pretty lame considering one of his arms is a gun and instead he walks around eating doughnuts. It's basically in thelame-o class with simple and pathetic animes like pokemon. Evangelion and Lain are complex, intrigueing, and enticing animes that always keep you coming back for more. Trigun is more the o.k this stinks, when is it going to be over type. How it got any fans at all is a mystery to me."
5,TRIGUN IS AMAZING,"I bought dvd after dvd of this series. It is an amazing story line with fantastic animation. Each character had there own history. This series is one the best I have ever seen. The action was amazing, and there was so much comedy that keeps things light. Each time you watch an episode you discover something new. Vash is a very interesting character and you are compelled to try to find out as much as possible about him, and he is also a very comedic character, completing each mission with a touch of humor. The life that Vash lives makes you feel sorry for him and what makes him act like that. Wolfwood is also very interesting character with him being a preacher and a great fighter at the same time is very exciting, his sense of justice is also very different from that of Vash, which makes them have a good but difficult friendship. I reccomend you buy the box set if you haven't seen the series, it is amazing."
3,Not as good as the books,"I used to love the Trigun anime series until I read Maximum manga. The differnce between the two are staggering. The Gung Ho Guns in Manga (some of them) were much more powerful than the one's in the series. Not to mention all of them weren't included. The series also makes Vash look like a wimp in the series. Compared to the mangas at least.Granted, if seen seperately they are both good and books always have room for more story. But if I were to recommend one it'd be the manga series wins hands down."
5,trigun,i love this anime vash is kool o even liked nickolis d. wolfwood but man it suckes that he dead in the show thow geat anime glade i bout it.
2,Great concept ruined by anime-cliches,"This series is a perfect example of classic anime silliness ruining what should have been an excellent experience. The series is beautifully drawn, the old west has a gritty feeling, and the scene is set for one of the finest westerns ever. However, the story can never stay serious for long enough to be convincing! The artist always feels the need to make Vash's eyes get really big and make his mouth take up 90% of his face when he screams. When he dodges bullets he looks like he's having some kind of seizure. Suspension of disbelief falls through the floor at that point. The finest anime are the ones that learn put humor in it's place. A gun battle is not that place.Save yourself the trouble and get Cowboy Bebop. The more ridiculous of anime art techniques are all constrained to one character in that show, which makes it much more bearable."
1,How can people like this anime so much?,"I think people like Trigun because they haven't seen anything better. I just finished watching it and it's horrible. The character designs are ugly, the backgrounds are drab and colorless, and none of the characters are interesting. Vash is the worst main character ever. He's only three-dimensional in the sense that he has one of three one-dimensional personalities: annoying wacko, whiny b*tch, and competent gunman. The first two personalities completely destroyed any interest I had in the third one. And he'll change personalities at the drop of a hat, which brings the viewer right out of the show to wonder, ""what else could I be watching?"" I'll admit the actual storyline is interesting, but there are too many filler episodes, and many questions are left unanswered.If you want to watch a good, well-established, anime series, try Cowboy Bebop or Neon Genesis Evangelion. Stay far away from Trigun."
1,pathetic,"It's an o.k anime, but compared to Evangelion and Lain it's pathetic. It is basically about some fool who eats donoughts and walks around causes destruction while two people follow him and ""clean it up"".

1,"not the worse, though not remotely decent","hmm....i don't know why so many people like this show. It isn't the worse anime, but it isn't even decent. i don't see how trigun is funny. It just has ALOT of lame jokes in it. If your looking for something funny, you don't have to put up with this, just go watch simpsons. watching Gary Coleman trying to run for govenor is funnier than trigun. trigun is about a guy with a gun so you would expect alot of action right? there is only a little action cuz the main character doesn't kill anyone and he always survives the impossible. The ending sucks because it comes so sudden and and the final battle is short and pointless. I'd recommend this if you are a kid 12 or under, but for anyone older, get a life don't waste money on this. It's not even worth the plastic that it is on."
4,Nicely packaged but bland collection of a classic series,"I've been waiting for a re-release of this series, and I'm glad to finally have it. Also, the art on the packaging is really something, with two movie poster parodies on the DVD cases and an emptying revolver chamber metaphor displayed on the disks. However, the collecting itself is feature minimal, with nothing but the episodes on the disks. The series often features late title cards, which appear after a short clip which sets up the plot of the episode. In a few cases this clip is missing."
4,Visually and intellectually stimulating social studies text!,"In the 90's I taught 4th and 5th grade in Baltimore, Maryland. I was so delighted with this textbook--with all of its stories and illustrations--that I just had to have it for teaching my own children.It is a lot like a good literature book with ""DK"" style illustrations. My male students used to be mezmerized by the full-page, full-color diagram of a continental soldier---I confess I was too. That's not all though, the book is very easy to use-for student and teacher alike.Far from being a dry,social studies text, this book has excellent photographs, illustrations, maps, diagrams, charts, time-lines, and primary-source literature.This book teaches social studies the way that children prefer to learn it----visually!"
2,"I got ""fingered""!",You see the straps in the picture.Well don't bother looking for them in the package cuz they ain't there. Useless w/o the straps.
5,Awesome melodic rock!,"This CD rocks! If you still listen to hair bands like Bon Jovi, Danger Danger, and Poison-BUY THIS ALBUM! The previous review was sent in during a moment of frustration. My apologies."
1,They do not return or exchange,"I bought the Alexander sweatshirt. The quality is substandard. The shoulders are off and the product is basically irregular! Although the company's statement shows that they accept returns and exchanges, after I received the item, I discovered that they do not either exchange or return because the item is considered a personal item (despite the fact that they have these items in stock)."
3,It's A Mystery Not Horror,I went into this book believing this was a horror novel; it's usually how the book is categorized. It's not actually a Horror novel; It's a Mystery loomed around the X-mas season. As for my personal taste; it was just OK
4,A 4 Star Review,"Thomas Altman, a pseudonym used by thriller wiz Campbell Armstrong, spares no expenses of his savoir-faire for this grade-B type of a novella about Christmas and the killer that roams a small town. Using a strong narrative and solid characterization, Altman creates an atmospheric tale that has a ""Halloween/Friday the 13th"" flavor to its overall delivery. As the title proclaims, BLACK CHRISTMAS is indeed a dark read; a sense of dread does stay ever so present as the reader gets caught up into the life of this troubled sheriff faced with a bloody Holiday season. The plot never ever looses steam, even when the culprit becomes more and more evident as the story progresses. But is it really who we think it is? That's what makes BLACK CHRISTMAS so much fun and a notch above these so-called horror/mystery/suspense sub-genres concocted into one novel. You'll definitely want to revisit Altman's turf once finished with this gem. This reviewer sure will.-----Martin Boucher"
3,Beware! MyWriting Lab Access Card is NOT Included!,"I ordered this textbook for my English class because my school was selling it for [...] and it was listed here for [...]. It was listed as (w/MY WRITING LAB)so I was VERY dissapointed when the book arrived without the MyWritingLab Access Code. I have contacted amazon to correct the error.The book is good. The Pathways Book was good too(the prereq to this one).I will still need to eventually order the MyWritingLab Access Code from the website for another [...] bucks so I am back to to spending [...] plus again which means I could have just got it from my school bookstore anyway. Luckly, I still have access to MyWritingLab for a few months of use, from the access card that was included in the Pathways book. Maybe by then I will have found something cheaper to get me thru the rest of the course."
3,Out of date now,"I purchased this book for my ENG 101 class, only to find out that a second edition came out and my professor required us to get Ed 2. (the first book was cheap! $4.00 on Amazon, only to have to go to the college bookstore and buy 2nd edition for $80!) I don't think there are too many noticible differences in ed.1 vs ed 2. As of this posting, I have a copy of the 2nd edition for sale on Amazon. I think it is listed at $25 now. Contact me if you are interested, though honestly, you could probably get away with using ed 1."
2,Terrible packing and no writing lab access code,"bought this book, and it came with terrible packing,( book was covered with a paper and tapes all over it, and when i opened it the edge of the book are wrinkled).Expressways: Writing Scenarios (2nd Edition) (Mywritinglab (Access Codes))"
4,80ies flashback.,"This was one of my fave albums when i was in my teens, and it's still a killer album.Stands the test of time..unlike the rest of their catalog."
5,Wrestlemania III,"The most classic Wrestlemania ever! It has alot of great matches like Ricky Steamboat vs. Randy ""Machoman"" Savage, Junkyard Dog vs. the King Harley Race, and of course Hulk Hogan vs. Andre the Giant. Now I know what the bad reviews are saying about how short these matches are and whatever but it doesn't matter, it's still 3 hours long and before each match, if you can remember, flashbacks are shown that explain how each superstar came into conflict and what led up to their classic battles. I love wrestling and this particular Wrestlemania was a birthday present bought for me by my parents to enjoy on pay per view. Loved it!!!"
2,Not National Mah Jongg League (USA),"To quote from page 6 in the book, ""Rules and strategies for a so-called mixed-hand variation of traditional Mah-Jongg are presented here.""Those who are playing with the 2002 card in the National League will not find much help in rules or strategies."
1,A bad copy of Hip Hotels,"Sure no pretence on the copy which is non existent, but the most disappointing feature is the fact that the images are weak , and in fact in some cases supplied by the hotels; as a result the book looks certainly more like a collection of bad hotel brochures. Why pay good money for that? Not withstanding the fact that it is doubtful whether the author actually visited the hotels. Not my idea of a useful guide. Obviously it is a commercial attempt to copy Hip Hotels, but frankly not worth it. In future I will just stick to the original..."
3,Depends on what your looking for...,"This book lacks information. It has virtually none refering to the hotels, just how many rooms and adress, and that's it. If you're looking for a photo book, then it's fine. It has some interesting photos and if you're into interior design you might like it. Not very useful for hotel choosing or anything else. Also some very cool spots are missing, but you expect that in every list."
3,An Awakening,"I am an Inclusional Aide for two children with Autism. I love my job and expend enormous amounts of emotional and physical energy daily. This book helped me to understand the incredible struggle and wonderful rewards parents of Autistic children realize every day. I specifically feel the financial advise for future planning is of the utmost importance. This book provides some realistic facts, many we may not want to face, but need to."
1,A dangerous and awful book. Stay away!,"This is a poorly written, out-of-date book which would be devastating to any parent of a child recently diagnosed with autism. It presents a picture of despair and hopelessness which isn't even accurate. Copies should not only not be bought, they should be destroyed."
5,A must read,"Dr. Powers has been a major contributor to the understanding of autism spectrum disorders for many years. The ORIGINAL book was one of the few available on the subject at the time of publishing, and while it is NOW outdated, it has been replaced by the current edition published in 2000. This edition contains much useful information that parents will not find elsewhere. I was, therefore, somewhat confused that the reviews for the previous edition are still on this website, as they really describe a different book, which is very misleading."
1,"A depressing, horrible book, read only after you've given up","Please, do not let this be the first book you read when your child is diagnosed. This book is depressing and includes no information about actually helping your child or dealing with the biological aspects of this disorder. This book assumes you have given up on treating your child's illness and that there are no comorbid disorders associated with the autism diagnosis, which is completely wrong. Keep searching, there is help and much better books."
1,I don't suggest this book,"I am sure the author didn't intend for this book to be depressing, but it actually is. It leaves the reader with very little hope, other than perhaps good placement in a residential home. Which is ironic, because the very last statement is that parents should have hope. Also, since it's an older book, the information is a bit outdated. I usually don't write negative reviews on books, but I had to be sure other parents of children with ASD knew to look elsewhere - this book is not a keeper."
2,A highly fictionalized account,"Although the author uses quite a bit of creative license in his tale of the events of the Mitcham war, the book is still enjoyable to read and gives a definite sense of the time period and location's culture. Having grown up in rural Alabama, I can attest that some of those cultural standards survive today.I think the characters were realistic, if a bit flat in places. The mystery was based entirely on the timeline of events and the author did a good job of keeping you intrigued in working it all out.I give this novel only 2 stars because the historical facts are few and far between, and due to the first chapter which cast a sour note over the rest of the novel for me. Animal lovers beware: you should either skip this first chapter, which adds little to the story, or prepare yourself for an overly detailed description of a main character drowning a sackful of puppies."
5,Wild on the Alabama Frontier,"Tom Franklin's novel, ""Hell at the Breech,"" has all of the elements of a good western: drunken gunfights, an aging but honorable sheriff, a wild posse ride, and a final bloody confrontation.What sets ""Hell at the Breech"" apart from more traditional westerns is, however, both its setting (southwestern Alabama) and Franklin's style, which reminds me more of Eudora Welty than Zane Grey.Like Peter Matthiessen's Lost River trilogy about the notorious Edgar Watson, who bullied people in the Everglades, Franklin's novel is based on a true episode in which a gang of thieves tried to establish their own violent fiefdom in an out of the way corner of America in the late 19th century.""Hell at the Breech"" not only has a fine roster of characters but a strong sense of place."
2,the color changed,I got 4 sets of the drapes and when I wet back and ordered 4 more the color was lighter! So now the valance is the same color as the drapes.
2,Darker than it Looks,"The picture provided is misrepresentative of the actual product. Althought the shape is accurate, the hue of the glass bowl is much darker than in the picture. There is very little contrast between the glass bowl & the metal fixture; something that is indicated in the photo. It also does not give off much light as only three 60 watt bulbs can be used. It's bright if the bowl is not installed."
5,AWESOME,Have ordered twice and always get cool pieces of jewelry! I RECOMMEND to anyone looking for fun jewelry and who like surprises!
5,so question,can I specify what kind I want? I'm about to get a surface piercing(2 actually) and I have a lip and belly button piercing. I don't know what I'd do with a eyebrow or tounge ring!
1,Miserable don't buy this garbage,"Shity belly button rings and eyebrow . No labret, metal hoops, cartilage or retainer.What a bag of trash stuff"
3,blah,Didnt read carefully and its whatever pieces they want to give you. All were unuseable to me. Not their fault. Were decent pieces if had right piercing. Were mostly navel rings in my set.
3,Eh...,"Received this product fast, and all 10 pieces were there. I was hoping to get something along the lines of the picture at the top, but I didn't. the only thing I got from that picture was 1 CBR, a few tongue rings that resembled the one shown there, a bunch of navel rings that DID NOT look like the picture shown there, and 3 plastic, flimsy eyebrow rings. BUT, I will definitely be ordering more from here to start a little piercing business because what I received was basic jewelry that I could use on customers, but not really myself."
4,Nice Stuff,"Shipping was pretty quick! Got my stuff within 3-4 days. I got nice jewelry but not enough lip rings inside..mainly nipple and eyebrow rings, 1 belly ring, 1 tongue ring, and 1 lip labret. I thought the horseshoe rings would be big enough for my lip but i guess not, just for other parts of the body. If i had at least 3 labrets then i would be perfectly satisfied. But other than that i recomemend to get this, especially for $[...] (a cheap price)"
5,Nice Jewlery,"Very fast shipping, it came a day before the expected date. I got a great variety too.I recieved 1 navel ring(14g), 2 tongue rings(14g), 2 horseshoes(16g), 3 labrets(1 14g, the other 2 16g), 1 eyebrow ring(16g), and 1 captive bead ring(16g)."
2,meh,"i recieved the item on time. I did not get what i wanted. Everything in the package was busted. I do not know how tiny plastic peices crack in half easily. I am not happy with the item. But, thanks for getting it on time."
1,Trudged along,"I didn't think this would be a bible study book! If you're not into reading bible quotes on nearly every page, bypass this book! Felt like I wasted an afternoon!"
1,Don't even bother!,"I LOVE Christian Chic Lit, & I even adored the prequel to this book, ""The Whitney Chronicles"", but Million Dollar Dilemma, was just ridiculous. I felt the plot was very contrived, and there was not a lot of character development. The pacing seemed off, and the storyline was just too bizarre. Now, sometimes it's fun to indulge in fantasy-reading, but as a reader, I sure couldn't ""just go along"" with it..... I love books that enrich my devotional life, but the scripture spouting seemed very forced, like the author said, ""Well, think I'll throw a scripture reference on this page.""I really did not connect at all to this character, Cassia. She was very flat, unseemingly naive, weak & had no personality.In fairness to Ms. Baer -I KNOW she is a good author, as mentioned above with her ""Whitney Chronicles"". I have heard from friends that other novels that she has written are equally as good. This was just not up to par.I recommend reading the Yada Yada Prayer Group Series."
4,A Really Interesting Find,"I agree with the previous reviewer that Dopper has a distinctive voice. The beginning of the Symphony No. 3 has touches of Mendelssohn to my ears, while the last half of the No. 6 is a little reminiscent of Carl Nielsen with a hint of Carl Orff. In between, meantime, we have an engaging melange of I-don't-know-quite-what. Whatever it is, it makes the journey from one end of this disc to the other quite enjoyable, with some memorable themes and changes in tone and orchestration that keep you on your toes. The other Dopper disc from Chandos, mentioned by the previous reviewer, is to me not half as interesting as the one under consideration, and if you've a mind to sample this composer's music, you should begin here."
1,It looks good.,The only good thing I can say about this is that it looks good. This is the worst money I have ever spent for anything. The first time I attempted to use it I knew I had bought a piece of junk. The mechanism stuck and I had to stop and try to adjust the lever. The multiple sifter did not let the flour through. A complete waste of money!
3,Good,"The cover for this CD holder is great. However, the folders inside which hold the CD's need stronger seals. Inserting the CD's tears the seal."
3,3 and a 1/2 stars,"Very good first LP. Instant classics like ""That's Rock'n'roll"", ""sounds of war"" and ""tired of me"". Wouldn't pay more than $13 bucks for it, but any Accept fan should own this. Pass over their 2nd and buy this."
4,Classic Metal,Early effort from Accept. A must if you are a fan. Raw and not as polished as later efforts but worth getting.
3,so aweful that it's good,"When I first got this album I was 13 and I never heard of accept,I just thought the artwork was cool.a woman with a huge chainsaw! I gotten rid of it but over the years kept going back and buying it again just to get rid of it again and why? udo is one of those singers you like or don't,quite bad in my opinion.and this album is aweful as well but it is classic music.lady lou,sounds of war,and that's rock n roll were the best tracks on the album,other ok songs are seawinds,free me now and tired of me. this is something all metalheads should check out but I wouldn't pay nomore than 10 dollars for it.and restless and wild is a good song,maybe the only song that accept have recorded that's really any good."
3,not as important as I'd hoped,I rely on reviews by others and found I was not as impressed by this work as other reviewers. Analysis of the assassination has come a long way since this was written.
2,Out-of-date,"This book could not be distributed in the US at the time it was published in Europe for obvious reasons: the author had seen a copy of the Zapruder film, which contradicts fundamentally the `findings' of the Warren Commission. The Zapruder film was not publicly available at the time.The copies available today are still censured: they create the illusion that the president's car didn't stop in order to give the snipers a better opportunity to shoot at the president.This book contains nothing new about the plot, which is debated in only a limited part of it.For a global evaluation of the JF Kennedy assassination I recommend the book `Deep Politics and the Death of JFK' by Peter Dale Scott.I cannot recommend this book."
4,"If you want to know the hows and whys, this is a good book","This book is required for the Culinary school that I attend and I have found it extremely helpful. As its title implies, it is for the serious student and a good reference book to keep because it identifies foods, explains proper handling, storage, and preparation tecnique, and also includes recipes. If you just want to throw together a recipe, buy a Betty Crocker cookbook. If you want to do it the professional way, buy this book."
5,A Wonderful Source on the Theatre,"When I saught out this book, I was on my way to writing a paper on what I found was the most important contribution the ancient Greeks have made to the modern times. I chose the development to live acting as the topic for my paper. A teacher of mine had recommended this book, and it had all of the right answers. It is extremely clear, and a background in the subject is not needed in order to understand it's content. I would definately recommend this as a book to use for any number of information-seeking opportunities which might come your way dealing with live theatre and its evolution."
3,"Nice at first, over time, appearance deteriorates","I got this soap dispenser as a Christmas gift to use in the bathroom. I loved it at first, but in the past month, (7 months later) I have noticed there is some kind of clear coating on it that is starting to come off. It is coming off where the soap has dripped onto the dispenser body. You can see the difference as it is more shiny where the coating is coming off.The part where the soap comes out works well and seems to be very sturdy. It would be a very nice soap dispenser if it wasn't for the coating coming off."
1,Avoid this disc!,"Whether you like ZZ Top, or not, this is a CD that should have never seen light of day. What was the point? ZZ Top's music has a real punch to it. That is lacking here. This is the first CD that I ever threw in the garbage after just one listen. I want a refund!"
1,An exercise in futility,"Having played RPG's for years, I had to check out this book for myself. I have heard about Pat Pulling and her ""crusade"" many times over the years. Well, I have to agree with Michael Stackpole.""Patricia Pulling's book is a monument to illogical thinking and innuendo. It is not sourced, though a bibliography is provided. Countless cases are reported with vague detail and pseudonyms so that no verification is possible for the ""facts"" they present. Most of the material printed is loosely rewritten from a host of BADD documents, or involves reprints of newspaper clippings. If not for its value in presenting ample evidence of Pat Pulling's incompetence, the book would be worse than worthless""-The Pulling Report 1990, Michael A. Stackpole."
1,DO NOT BUY,I dont know how to discuss this worthless book. What a waste of paper. The book has no redeeming value except that it burns quite well. Read Dr. Seuss instead.Nothing in Pullings book is really based upon reality. She makes up statistics. Search the internet for Michael Stackpoles defense of RPG's.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. You are better using your money by buying 20 year old cans of pork and beans.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK.
1,Bollocks,Has anyone written a book about incompetent parents who ALLOW their children to be pushed over the edge by boardgames or music. Or how about intolerant religious zealots who cry about the dangers of fictitious cults while turning a blind eye as their own clergy sodomize little boys.
3,Read with caution,"I haven't read this title yet, but I am interesting in reading it to see how insane this woman really was. I suggest that you read it in conjunction with: The Pulling Report 1990, Michael A. Stackpole which is available online for free."
4,Glad That They Remastered This One!!!,"I purchased ELO 2 on CD a few years ago and was really disappointed at the awful production. That won't be the case here as it is newly remastered. Outstanding songs on this one are Momma, Kuiama, and a spectacular version of Roll Over Beethoven. This is ELO before they turned to a pop/rock sound. These guys are classical rock at it's finest. I am so glad that they remastered this one!!! Thanks."
3,"OK, but not my ELO style","Being unfamiliar with nearly all of the songs on this CD, I trusted my affinity for other, later ELO works and ordered it up. Except for Roll Over Beethoven, I was underwhelmed. That's not to say that this is a bad album. On the contrary, the musicianship and production is top notch. It's just that this release was prior to the group establishing its later style (ala ""Face the Music"", for example) that I prefer. I suggest you listen to the sound bytes available on the web prior to purchasing this if you're like me and are only familiar with the later works - I didn't."
4,Mayer's Conflict Resolution primer,"A serviceable text for students and acolyte practitioners of conflict resolution. This was required reading for a Master's course, and I found it to be engaging, immensely readable, and applicable. Since it is an entry-level text, it covers broad approaches and does not offer much specificity to a particular field of conflict resolution (international diplomacy, social work, and business negotiations are all painted with the same brush). Still, it is a testament to the universality of Mayer's core concepts that his conflict resolution methodology loosely applies to all of these venues."
1,The Dynamics of Conflict Resolution,"I found the information to be less is then I expected. Everything is common sense, and to charge so much for a textbook is ridiculous. I am extremely upset with the author, and Amazon for selling such useless garbage."
2,Dynamics of Conflict Resolution: A Practitioner's Guide,I know others have found this a good resource but I found it very dry and tedious to read. I returned the book.
3,It's a firewall book,"Needed it for class. This book uses Cisco syntax. It's a decent reference, although it's easier to find information on an internet search. This book is not organized that well and has poorly named titles making it hard to search the index for specific information."
5,WOW!,"What a book...As a relative new comer to IT security I'm digesting all I can lay my hands on. This book by SANS Institute is a rare gem. It starts easy and escalates subject by subject. This is the kind of book where I read a chapter, think about it for a week or so, then pick it up for another chapter. There's just too much for me to blast through, and gather all the knowlege. I award 5 stars and I'm not even finished yet"
3,not as appears on the internet,I got 2 pair they both and the pearls on both of them looked like snow men.
2,Not as pictured... at all!,"I got these because I had also purchased the green peridot which I absolutely adore.... these? The amethyst looked almost ""bleached"" and the two earrings doesnt evne look uniform. Barely even purple at all... I'm a bit disappointed and am still debating if I should keep it or not....I rated it 2 stars just because Amazon does have an awesome return policy and customer service.... and the earrings are okay... just not as pictured and looked like I said... bleached.. =("
3,Simplistic,It's simplistic. I wanted something with pearls and real stones and this one fit the bill. My only dissatisfaction is that the pearls are misshapened and you can clearly tell where the center is still being rounded out - you can see these medium sized threads around the entire middle of the pearl where the oysters were still working on forming the pearl.
1,Low quality - not as pictured,I bought these as a gift and was very disappointed when they came. The pearls looked very pathetic and had a rings around them. (The pearls were not smooth.) I returned the earrings.
5,300 Hints to Make Parkinson's Disease Easier,This is an excellent and helpful book. I wish everyone who is suffering from this awful disease could have a copy of it to help them in their daily lives.
4,very nice celestial stencils,"This stencil set arrives in a laminated folder containing an envelope with three sheets of laser-cut designs. The description says there are ten designs, but they are selling themselves short. Many of the designs contain multiple images, and a couple of them contain quite a few. There are almost 50 stars of various sizes and styles; one large group of stars is set up as a border. Two suns (one elaborate and about 6 inches square, the other simpler and about 3 inches square), two crescent moons (one plain, one smiling), and three planets (and a couple of small full moons) complete this very nice set."
5,Makes history come alive for young readers.,"Joy Hakim clearly understands the subject, and the mind of her audience.In History of US, Joy Hakim skillfully assembles the most relevant parts of history, and presents them in a manner that is both enlightening and entertaining. History of Us is more than the tired recall of wars and dates; it explores the world and minds of people, and provokes questions and interpretations. Well researched, it provides a thoughtfully balanced view of complicated situations, such as the impact of Europeans on the Native Americans, religious expression and intolerance, economics and immigration, and a whole lot more.We used this award winning series as our curriculum guide for a year-long history field trip around the country, and an essential reference for our own website. Both of our kids, 10 and 8, could easily follow the flow of history, and understand the lessons that were presented.Comprehensive, without being exhausting, this is a great work."
5,As a student,"My 8th grade history class started these books back when they first came out in paperback volumes (in fact, I think our first couple were still hardcover) and I can honestly say we had a ball with these texts. I would sit in the car on the way to my riding lessons and just read them like regular books (my history teacher had to keep giving me the next ones early). I'm now a student of history in college and Joy Hakim's series definitely was part of the inspiration for my choice of major, because she proved that history didn't have to be all facts and boring outlines. It could actually be interesting and feel real. Definitely an excellent read for anyone."
1,Bad History book,"I teach 8th grade social studies and this textbook is the worst piece of garbage I have ever read. There is no relevant vocabulary, no glossary, and lacks important facts. It is unfortunate that trees were killed to write this horrible book."
3,Pretty good,"Written in a format that appeals to any reader, as in, a conversational tone, defintely improves their readability. The layout of pictures, photos, titbits of information, etc. prevent the child from groaning at yet more blocks of text at each turn of the page.The author is fairly opinionated, making bold statements that could cause the reader to think her word is final on any given subject in the books.I'd still recommend them for middle grades. At that age, anything that stimulates some sort of interest in history is miraculous! Thankfully more factual, less opinionated history books are read in High school, even if they are as boring as heck."
4,One star reviews miss the point...,"These are well, written, engaging books. Please, folks - don't sweat over the few inaccuracies... The point is to engage younger students, and discussions of fact v. opinion are part of the critical thinking process we want our kids to learn. I purchased these volumes for my daughter one by one as they were published. They sparked her love of history and she went on to AP US History in high school (5 on AP test) and is now an honors history major at the University of Texas. Hence the 4 star review... Oh, Joy, why oh why didn't you write the science series first? Then I might have a physicist in the family!"
1,Full of inaccuracies,"Her ""History of U.S."" is anything but, honestly. Just about every chapter has some historical inaccuracy or another, or at the least some sensationalist exaggeration. Her style of writing is absurd as well. Honestly, I'm sure her defense would be that it ""makes things fun and accessible to students"" but quite frankly, the level of sweeping, emotional phrases puts her on par with Stephanie Meyer (author of Twilight series). Really, perhaps Hakim should have gone for writing about sparkly vampires as well - the result would probably be just as accurate as any of her so-called history books, and then her insertion of her own opinion into everything she writes about would actually make some sense. History from a biased, emotional, inaccurate author who lacks any credentials in history."
1,Political correctness hits the middle school.,"Our 6th grader just finished using this series of books for his history class. We studied and read it along with him. The series is filled with mushy infomation, not clearly presented either chronologically or factually. Facts and historical perspective are completely lost amidst the heavy burden of political correctness. Like an artifact of today's education, we are planning on putting it in a time capsule to be dug up in the future so others will appreciate what the 90's were like."
1,The KKK was misunderstood?,Where did she get her information? There is not a glossary to check or index either. I don't like it.
5,Joy Hakim Brings History to Life,I used these books to teach my sons American History. They are very flexible to use and keep children and adults engaged. They are full of great pictures and lots of interesting sidenotes.
4,Loving history,"I have 2 teens who really do not like to read. However, this set really grabbed their attention and made history come alive."
3,Nice for the price!,"Nice product, better looking than the picture. I paid much less than they are currently selling for so watch for sales from this seller."
4,The best NHB promotion in the world!,"Matches are: Takada vs Mark KerrCarl Melenko vs Egan Inoue,Igor Vovchanchyn vs Carlos Barreto,Akira Shoji vs Guy Metzer,Nobuaki Kakuda vs Hiroki Kurosawa,Daijiro Matsui vs Carlos Newton,Sakuraba vs Ebenzer Braga,Naoya Ogawa vs Gary Goodridge"
5,Excellent clipper!,"I originally bought these for a friend because I was sick of listening to him complain about how his clippers were all worn out. He loved them! I watched as he cut one of our friend's hair into a military-style buzz cut. Its lightweight design and cordless operation made maneuvering very easy. The clippers worked and looked great! Sadly, the same could not be said for the man's haircut (that was operator error and NO fault of the clippers). I would recommend this clipper set to anyone, and would make a great gift!"
3,Great Ladies,This is a great CD if you like REAL cajun music. These are very talented ladies. Good listning and foot stomping music...
1,THE CD I GOT WOULD NOT PLAY SO I RETURNED IT,AMAZON IS SENDING ME ANOTHER COPY-AMAZON HAS BEEN VERY RESPONSIVE AND FAIR WITH MY PROBLEM. THEY ARE SENDING ME ANOTHER COPY AT THEIR EXPENSE.
4,A good buy,"I have had the steel bow for about 6 weeks now. It has helped me loose weight and my muscles are firmer. I no longer have back pain. Also it has encouraged my 6 year old daughter to exercise as well which is a good thing.I don't believe this device will increase your strength as effectively as lifting weights would, nor do a full body workout like weights would - but it is portable and quick and will make you fitter and stronger than you would if you did nothing. Which is important to me as I travel frequently. Definitely worth buying.Also it is much cheaper than weights or a home gym. And it can fit easily in a closet so not taking up much space in your homeI also use the larger bullworker - both compliment each other as some exercises are more effective with the larger device and some are more effective with the smaller device."
1,poorly made,"I received one of these as a gift and though I found the compact size very comfortable, I found this product to be cheaply made. When changing the spring I had difficulty removing one of the screws using a very short stub screwdriver. I finally got it out and was able to change the spring but I had to get a more substantial screw and had to re-tap the screw hole. Knowing what I do now, if I had to buy one I'd pass."
2,Skipp this and buy Isometric Power Revolution By John P.,"I can't use this thing. I like isometrics, but I get tennis elbow from the Bullworker. I just tried one rep on the chest press and I felt pain immediately. I would have only given this one star, but it is OK for doing abs work. I Have been using John Peterson Isometric workout for close to a year. It is a better program, and there is no equipment, and if the exercises are done right there is no pain. If your wondering yes I have seen grate results with my isometric workouts. Johns program is excellent."
3,Good quality but....,"The steel bow is smaller than the regular Bullworker but it is really well made and will last a long time.I just don""t think this type of excercise is really that effective.You can get toned but it really has its limitations."
3,Not as I expected,"When I was a teenager, I had the classic Bullworker that I loved. Thirty 30 years later, I wanted to impress my teenage son with it, but it did not happen. The first two springs are very easy to bow, the third one is si hard to even move in some exercises. Grade: C"
4,Powerful little workout machine,"This is a great product. But, use it wisely and as is recommended. It is light weight and convenient. It works if you work it, as recommended. Set achievable fitness goals and use common sense with the diet and exercise routine. The result is amazing strength."
5,Love This,"I use this when I`m on the road.Like its big brother,which I use at home,it works great with my arthritis problem.It not only builds and tones my muscles,it works on my joints.This keeps my pain at bay.I cant live with out this.Excellent quality too.This thing is bullet proof."
4,Wonderful Wibbly!!,"I bought this book because my 2 yr old grandson fell in love with another Wibbly book called ""Everyone Hide from Wibbly Pig"". Although this one reminds me of Jack and the Bean Stalk, it's simple and fun. I think ""Everyone Hide from Wibbly Pig"" is the all time best, but this is certainly a wonderful follow-up to that. ALL of the Mick Inkpen books I've purchased for my grandson have been favorites that we have read so many times, my grandson can 'read' them to me because he knows them by heart! Your kids will love his books."
1,"Great villain, horrible story","This play is truly sickening. The villain, Iago, is actually a fairly common person in real life, the kind of person whose greatest joy is seeing others in misery, who loves to turn people against each other and laugh. I used to work with an Iago. You probably did too. Shakespeare deserves a lot of credit for creating this villain. But the play itself is too much. As I'm sure you know, Othello's sweet wife Desdemona, well maybe I shouldn't spoil the horrid ending if you actually don't know it. Iago convinces Othello that his wife is cheating on him. Othello believes the wrong person. The Iagos of the world are very persuasive, particularly when they are smarter than the people they are lying to."
5,Perfect adult refresher...,"while the large font, short sentences and shortness of the book seem tailored to youth, I found this book very enjoyable. It's nice to have complex subjects explained AS IF to a child. Though I have studied lots of advanced texts, I found things in this book that I did not know. Even better, I found things explained from simpler perspectives that I had not considered. I intend to find the rest of the books in this series by the Rosen Publishing Group."
2,"Nice history, not much on how to play though","The chapters on how to play are very sparse, this is geared more towards people who want to make their own instruments, and want to know about the history of the instrument. He only goes over how to make four different sounds, which isn't very much.. I'm looking for a better book to learn how to play more..."
1,REM LOSES THEIR RELIGION.,"REM is so tired....every song is now a very slow, depressing depict on American life.There is no question this song sounds like every other drone out song they have produced in the last few years.What happened to the REM I remember, with Green, Orange Crush, etc....I miss you.Michael get off your Ego Music Mechanical Horse and start writing some real music.Why this CD is getting 5 star reviews is really beyond my comprehension....The single I give 1 star because it is only 1 song, the album is 0 stars because there is more of the same depressing trash on this CD called ""Up"" which should of been called ""Down"".The audience has spoken to their album did not even go GOLD (selling at least 500,000 copies), and this single never peaked above no.59 on the billboard singles chart....Thank god."
2,A dreary film with an intriguing gimmick.,"Although not a good film, this British SF effort (based on a novel by Charles Maine) includes one unique gimmick. The ""maguffin"" information is hidden 7 1/2 seconds in the future! But the rationale for this development is very flimsy, and it is only a side issue in the plot. Overall a dull film, with good performances from its two stars (both American), Gene Nelson and Faith Domergue."
5,Inspirational Page Turner,Very inspirational. I very much enjoyed this story of Ludmilla Javorova as an example of one who served in the underground Church. The dedication with which she has served the church moved me to consider my own calling to ministry within the church. She served long before she was ordained and continues to serve faithfully today.
2,Poorly written,"A poorly written account that is deceptive because just because a Bishop lays his hands on a woman does not mean she has been ordained. SInce the church forbids it, the ordination was invalid. History teaches that whenever women are ordained (episcopal church) , heterosexual men and families leave the church in mass numbers."
4,Good Case,This is a well designed case. The only reason i didnt give this case 5 stars is when you put the umds into the slots you cant see what they are.
2,No good in my experience,"This case is very cheaply made and flimsy. It arrived broken, but partially usuable still. The cheap plastic and springs used will break quickly if they actually do arrive intact.It will hold the games, sure, I am just used to using a higher quality, more dependable product"
2,Davey Crockett book,"It was listed as ""good condition"" and in my opinion it was poor...at best. I am giving it as gift and am embarrassed by the condition."
1,C.D. is BOOTLEG,This is a bootleg C.D. These posers have taken on someone elses identity and are attempting to make illegal money on the internet. In No WAY does this person have permission to sell this C.D.
2,damage,"To my knowledge it works okay, but the base of the dvd was highyly scratched up. When I buy something I usually expect it not to be damaged"
1,Poor Design!,"I received this as a birthday present, and thought that it would be really neat. I was wrong. It appears that the people at Nokia didnt really give this head set a test drive. When you are wearing the piece, the microphone is about 18 inches away from your mouth. Very hard for people to hear you when you are talking to them. Also, the cord from the microphone to the phone is very short, so you can't even put the phone in your pocket and keep the headset on to listen to the radio at the same time. On the good side, everything sounded very good through the ear phones(everything was a little loud for my taste), and when I held the microphone up to my mouth, people said I sounded crisp and clear--although holding the microphone kind of defeats the purpose of a hands free headset...I highly recommend looking into some other product."
1,WORST DESIGNED HEADSET EVER,"I have been the recipient of the following comments while ""using"" this headset - and experimenting with the mic held at various distances, even NEXT TO my mouth:""You sound like you're talking over a 1970s school PA system""""You sound like you're calling from Europe... in the 1950s""""I can't hear a word you're saying""""Speak up!!!""""Are you in a tunnel?""""GET A NEW HEADSET!!!!""...let it be said I wish for this product there were negative stars; because of this ""headset"" I now have radiating pain from my neck to my hand due to being forced to cradle my tiny cell phone between my ear and shoulder. I'm still trying to find a better headset that will fit this crazy Nokia jack and also work with the radio on my 7280!! Help is welcome!"
2,Only good for extreme beginners...,"I bought this book with the hopes that I'd save some time by not having to create my own network documentation templates when I started freelancing as an IT consultant. So I bought the more expensive consultant's version with editable forms.This book would be great for the beginner in a little company, but personally, I would be embarassed to present most of these forms as documentation to any of my clients! If you're experienced at all, I wouldn't recommend this book - especially since the consultant's edition as it is VERY expensive for what you get.If you're just starting out or haven't had to think about network documentation ever, then this will get you started.I commend the author for taking the initative in trying to come up a pratical manual for this, but for someone who has 23 years of experience, the author should have been able to produce much better/professional forms."
4,Everything you need to get started on your documentation,This book is everything you need to get started on your documentation for your customers. Karl covers the documentation you need to create to fully cover your customers networks.Don't expect to buy this book and be done -- this book will give you guidance and a starting point to create your own comprehensive documentation. You should take Karl's work and make your own documentation from it. You'll be able to save enough of your own time re-inventing the wheel to pay for the book and make a profit.
4,Fun movement for your kids,"I have 4 and 6 year old daughters. My 4 year old is especially active and she absolutely loves this video. Now she can exercise like mommy does! My 6 year old got a little tired doing this, but I'm glad to see her moving. I'd say my only complaint is that some of the movements go by so quickly. They switch from the lion, on to the seal, on to the fish, etc. in very quick segments. I think they could have extended that about 30 more seconds give or take. But overall, they love all the animal movements they get to do in the video. I recommend to all."
1,Kan throw your money down the drain!,"Be really careful of this one! We have been using the wipes for a few months and just this week we had a back log in the toilet. I was thinking maybe something else had happened and then the poor bowl couldn't take it anymore. The cost of the drain clearing was more then $150 USD! We came out with a grocery bag of kandoo wipes. I have only used 3 packs! I didn't flush more then the recomended amount and the backup happened at the end of our private line. If this is what they do at the end of three packs and a month or two, I can only imagine what happens to other people!Kandoo will be getting a bill from our home. Don't let it happen to yours!The product was a great idea for our son who was training. The marketing was perfect and we liked the orange packs scent. But overall with the misrepresentation of the product I have to flush this product down the drain....Ooops forgot, they don't flush!"
1,Without a Trace...should be without a picture.,It would not play in USA...got a message...wrong region. Couldn't figure out how to return it as the return address was smudged and there was no packing slip to facilitate returns. I like the serier....not this vendor....ever again.
4,"It's good this is getting more releases, even if it's not in stores","It's been five years since the release of season 2, and 8 since season 1. I suppose it's (and shouldn't be) no surprise that it's not getting released in stores, since that would be expecting too much demand. Still, being available online only is better than no release at all, right? And Season 4 is going to be released as well. Let's just hope the last 3 get released. I have watched every episode of the series, and it's a great series."
2,Without a Trace,"It is set in the wrong region so I am un-able to watch it. I haven't yet gotten this resolved.Thank you,CFrench"
3,Five stars for the production values and the cast but sometimes the stories are about annoying people.,"Sometimes the inane behavior of the missing is just too much for me but I can see why this show has a strong and loyal fan following. I liked some of the episodes of this season (the Cliffhanger 2-parter especially when someone who has walked in those same shoes still gives a little girl the wrong kind of present - take her to Toys R Us!) and was bored by some others (e.g. three in a row: Malone v. Malone, 4 and Penitence.) This season's episodes seem to be really about people whose choices I would never make. But it's still a good show with a great cast. There's something comforting about dense Anthony LaPaglia being on the case and doing basic interviews on behalf of the missing. Very Daddy Bear."
1,Wrong Item?!,"I ordered this item a while ago. It works in my camera, but it is not a usb. I don't even think that's the brand of card it was. I was disappointed."
4,Still a little fishy,"Let's face it, there really isn't a way to cover up the smell of fish. :o It doesn't seem to bother my husband or rift on him, but it does on me. So I think it's just one of those things that vary from person to person. What else can we say?"
3,"Hard to rate a supplement, but...","About the only way to rate a fish oil supplement is by whether or not it gives ""fishy burps"". This one does. A lot. And I love me some Dr. Weil. I got those because I trust him and if you take 2 it's got as much epa/dha as the Minami Nutrition ones, which are more expensive. But the Minami ones taste of lemon and they don't give fishy burps at all. So, I'm considering going back to them if I can find them cheaper than I originally did at my local health food store."
1,Disapointing,I was really looking forward to this book. I was expecting it to be very interesting based on the book description. I am now about 3/4 of the way thru and am having to force myself to finish reading it. It's very slow moving and I can't stand both the hero or the heroine. The hero is too dominant in a bit of a male chavunistic way and the heroine is to submissive (although at times she tries not to be she just can't make it work) and is too much of a whiner.This book had a good story idea and could have been so much better.
4,Good..but for adults,"This is a good book with interesting tips and ideas for teens and college age kids. While the book does deal with the topic of drinking and insulin, it is not in a ""lush/Greek chug"" kind of manner. I don't recall anything about pot in there (especially in it being OK) but I would agree that it is more of an adult read. Once you have read it,then pick what you want to discuss with your children about the ideas from the book. It is a realistic look at how teens and college kids handle life with diabetes. While you may dream and hope your child never wants to touch alcohol in college, will dilligently change out their sites and watch their BG levels, we all know that in the end they are all possibly forgotten when having fun with friends, under the stress of finals or what not. This book helps you prep them and yourself for ways around these scenarios and how to deal with them. Better to be informed than in the dark."
4,Really Cool is Really Good,"This excellent book has been a mine of information for both my adult daughter and my three year old grand-daughter. Both of whom are insulin dependent diabetics. Although some of the tips are specifically aimed at Americans, or those with insulin pumps, the main thrust of the book is for all diabetics and their families."
5,Happy shopper...,The book was in perfect condition and the shipping was swift. Would happily buy from again...
