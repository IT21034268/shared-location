2,Clark's shoes,These shoes have not lasted long. After a year the stitching has come loose. They are made in China. Clark's I have purchased in the past were made in Italy and lasted lots longer. I wold not buy these again.
5,Classy and comfortable,Bought these for my Dad and he loves it. High quality and super comfortable he says. The level of quality is evident with this shoe and the price is good with comparisons to other sellers and sites.
3,Great bands don't last forever.,"I love this band. But Annabella Lwin in her mid 30's doesn't have the power and youthful vibrancy that she did in her mid teens. You can hear her struggle to recreate that vibe, without complete success. Also they've lost their original guitarist, Matt Ashman, who'd contributed significantly to their sound.This album sounds like a fun live-show, and it's also very raw - unlike their highly produced studio albums. But the recording quality isn't great either - it all sounds muffled. They were imitating their younger-selves here. So if you're a big fan it might be worthwhile, but don't pay a premium for it."
4,admitted bow wow wow fan here...,"ok, so i admit that i probably like this album because i was actually at one of the concerts that was recorded. (sometimes i can even imagine i hear myself yelling anabella's name...) but in re-listening to it, i hear energy, enthusiasm, and lively sense of fun. the band doesn't seem to take itself too seriously, but they do realize that they have fans who are there for the music. anabella lwin sounds great which is impressive given that most of her original vocals were recorded when she was in her teens. the play list is a bit of a rehash of previous albums - but that's a given considered the limited amount of material the band put out in the first place. and in honesty, i'm not listening to bow wow wow 'cuz of their new material."
4,Beautiful photos and flavorful dishes,"The recipies in the book are easy to follow and I like all the photos. Not every dish is photographed, but I like to know how the food is supposed to look before I prepare it. I am new to Mediterranean Cooking and this book is a great place to start. The dishes are very flavorful and use everyday common ingredients."
2,disappointed,"I have the book ""a taste of Lebanon"" and I use it all the time, this new book had very few recipes that I would try, so I would not recommend it for good cooks. We love to experiment, and learn new ethnic recipes, but this book did not do it for us."
5,What a CD,For all lovers of pure carnatic music this CD is a must buy. Compositions redered here are rare known only to the Dhanammal family. None of the are by the trinity. The swaras and the kuraipu in the rudrapriya will knockyou down.. nadanamakriya is just out of the world.. for many people who cannot tell the diffrenc between mayamlavagowla and nadanamakriya here is an example of what nadanamakriya is. after you here this kanada you will not here another kanada.. trust me this one is fantastic
2,Good while it lasted,"My son received this as a Christmas present. He was enjoying it for a few weeks. It doesn't preform well in low light settings. About three weeks later, there were no words or icons on the screen. I visited the Mustek website and they didn't even list this camera as one of their products. So I called their customer help line (a toll call) and received no help at all. I was on hold more than I was speaking to the rep. He didn't understand what I was saying anyway. Needless to say the camera has been returned and we will be buying a different product."
5,Perfect...,Very nice camcorder .. I appreciate your offer .. great sale .. Thank you again for being so nice .
1,don't bother it with your hard earning money,"I got it in a week,and at the same day I returned it to Amazon. Now I AM arguing with Amazon why they would NOT like to give me a full refund for such bad product. It was the worst one I have ever seen in the digital camera field. I am not talking about the value itself on such price.I am talking about the quality of this product,particularly,when I found the lid of card-holder can't be closed at all. The LCD is awful too,although I even didn't turn it on. I can't believe how disappointing until I see it.Save your money.later, Amazon promised to give all my money back. So I am happy with Amazon service."
3,mustek a must for the megapixles alone..,"The DV 9300 has some really good qualities and a few not so good.image quality is fantastic. movies resolution great for the amount its costs.Movies are fomatted in the ASF mode but the quality is great.. When using flash taking pics flash lags behind shutter' also, zoom is poor... but for the price Ive found it Great.. 3 and a half stars.."
4,Mustek DV 9300 Digital Video Recorder,"Bought this camera for my 14 year old granddaughter as a birthday gift. She likes it very much, so much in fact, that she uses none of the other cameras in her house. Time will tell if it stands up to usage."
4,Great for a teenager,"I bought this for my daughter for her 14th birthday. She loves it, she takes it everywhere. She uses all the functions on it, camera, video, mp3. The only thing is we have not figured out how to download all her videos onto discs to keep for storage. We bought a 1 gb card to wo with it and she has used it endlessly for 6 months. Its a great purchase for a teenager."
4,Fun Camera!,"This camera is a lot of fun! It easily fits in your pocket, and takes fairly good pics and videos. The downside is that its very cheaply made so you have to be real careful with it. Also it's not very good in low light situations. Even with the downsides I find this camera to be a great buy for the low price,and is very convenient for on the go situations when you need to capture a spontaneous moment with a pic or video. Overall it gets four and a half stars from me!"
5,Tom Hamilton was right!!!!,"Tom Hamilton (Aerosmith, bass) said that he used the Bass Fitness book in the late 80s to prepare for Pump. In a month, I have gotten so much better due to this book. In addition to the claims on the cover, my timing has improved as well as muting strings. It also keeps me from getting in a rut. This morning I did exercise 56 and it was very challenging to where i could only get to 120 bpm-usually I can do 170. I have gotten a better understanding of the guitar neck as well."
3,Not what I expected!,This is not quite what I expected. It is a book of scales and warm up exercises.
5,Unleashing the Value of Supply Chain Management,"This article may be helpful to accounting and finance business people because it introduces the concept of supply chain management as way to create customer value rather than merely to contain costs. This perspective is not the prevalent way that supply chain management is viewed by most business organizations. However, the increasing commoditization of the goods element of many firms' products means that the services surrounding those goods often represent the most viable means of differentiating a firm's products. And the output of the supply chain management process is the service provided for the firm's customers. Accordingly, the value creation perspective articulated in this brief article should prove informative to many business executives and managers."
5,I wore it out.,"I cannot say enough about this CD....I absolutely LOVE IT!! It goes from my car to my work area...basically wherever I go, it's playing. Great background music but also a fabulous introduction to the most common mantras used in Kundalini Yoga. My CD is so overplayed and abused that I think I need to purchase a new copy soon. I also purchased the accompanying book and I suppose this is the only negative I have...I wish the book would have noted what track # on the CD for corresponding Set and the CD noted the page number of the set for corresponding tracks. I realized the book was probably published before there ever was a CD but it should be considered for future editions. Both the book and the CD are well worth every penny which was not much. I highly recommend these products. Sat Nam."
1,I should have listened to the other reviews,I didn't care for this CD at all. I'm not sure if it's the singer's voices or what. I would find it difficult to listen to this CD during any type of meditation.
2,Tail can be a choking hazard,"My son has always liked this toy, however the tail w/ ribbons can be a choking hazard."
2,Hyping spike,"I rated Spike as 2** principally because my daughter only cares about one of Spike's features -- the claw with the little beads suspended in plastice. As for the rest of Spike, she could care less, rather unlike the reviews from parents whose kids couldn't stand to be away from Spike. I do like the durability and washability features though, because we throw Spike around the crib and on the floor all the time."
4,A fun and educational set,"This is a nice, themed little magic set. Our son used tricks from this for a mini magic show he did at school and it was rather a success. The tricks were fun and educational, though some of them seem a mite tricky and may take a bit of practice. Most of the items in the set (paper cups, paperclips, etc.) are things you could find around your house. You could actually get away with just having the little instruction booklet. Thus my four-star rating."
2,Good... For Only 1.5 Years,"I got this microwave a year and a half ago. It worked well initially, heating items up faster than others. But last week, the microwave died on me, after only 1.5 years (which is very poor performance for a microwave- many have been known to last 10 years). The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because when it worked, it worked well. But I would not recommend this microwave."
4,Good,The product is good but it the light is not on when the door is open. It would have been really good if this option there. Most microwaves has this option.
3,A Panasonic at Reduced Price,"I gave this microwave a ""3,"" not because it didn't work as advertised, and not because it doesn't produce a wonderful final product, but because learning how to work it, and the difficulty of pressing the numbers for timing. I nearly ruined the outside of it by pressing too hard on one of the numbers before I learned that you have to hit ""STOP/RESET"" before you select your timing numbers. However, after I learned this ""secret,"" it became easier and easier to operate efficiently. I had a lower-wattage microwave without turntable before, for about 6 years, and figured it was time to get a new one, especially at this price. The Panasonic I bought has a turntable, and I no longer have to guess at the timing for my frozen foods. The ""hot-ness"" of the final product was a revelation - something I was not aware of with my old microwave. If you want a great microwave with turntable, then this should be your choice."
1,Poor Quality Panasonic,"This microwave doesn't meet the quality that you expect from Panasonic. I have owned mine for a little over a month and it's off to the repair center. It overheats and trips the 20amp circuit breaker. Overall, having mentioned the major defect, the unit is cheaply constructed. The door is flimsy, the display window light is too dim to read easily, and there is no light in the unit unless it is in operation. Thumbs down, I wish I had not purchased it."
1,"Nice if it works, but . . .","Now returning my second unit because heater unit stops working after a few weeks (note: Amazon did a fantastic job of processing the first return). Fed up with this model - obviously something is very wrong with this design. I mean, come on, Panasonic - Microwaves are hardly new!"
4,Good read,I enjoyed this book and it's four separate stories. Great CHRISTian romance. Excellent period descriptions.
2,The Golden Age,"I have heard good things about John C. Wright, but I certainly found this book hard to get into and gave up after 50 pages."
2,"Distressingly Anticlimactic, Needlessly Opaque...","..and slow as molasses. The jargony, overwrought prose of this debut novel might fool some of the people, but when you strip away the words that hang like too-ripe grapes, one sees that there is, in effect, no real plot. The Golden Age is vista after vista of astonishing sights and as vast as the ocean...if the ocean were about knee-deep. I kept thinking to myself, as I slogged my way through the first hundred pages - ""Tanith Lee already wrote this story twenty years ago, and she did it much better."" (Don't Bite The Sun, Daw Books)I found this novel an unfinishable disappointment."
2,Timothy Leary Lives,"This might have been pretty good if I'd been stoned when I read it. It's 10,000 years in the future and folks live forever if they choose and can do whatever they want...as long as their bank account is fat enough...and even the poorest of the poor seem to be living pretty good. Of course, people being people they still manage to screw up occasionally, but it doesn't matter since they just have their memories redacted and then they can go on living like the big screw up never happened. But what if they want the memory back? Oops, time to call in the all knowing mega-computers to figure out a plan to outsmart the other mega-computers that are cramping your style, er, memory. Maybe this book is just a acid trip put to paper. Maybe you have to be on acid to try to describe human life 10,000 years from now. Maybe you have to be on acid to enjoy it."
2,Dull and pointless,Imagine a couple of interesting concepts wrapped in enough ridiculous minute details and pointless characters. Or don't imagine it and read this book.
1,Totally unreadable,"Another of these SF books where the author thinks that SF is simply about making up obsure words and describing ""future"" sounding technology without any need for boring old-fashioned plot, character development, social parabole, internal consistency, and ... oh yeah readability.I'm sorry Mr Wright, but aligning 30 new made up words per page for the sole purpose of stuning your readers by some would be never-seen-before show of creativity gets boring very quickly. And the volume of random twists thrown in there solely for unpredictability, and without any sort of introduction or vague rationale is both very easy and lame. None of that qualifies as good SF.Another reviews describes the book as intellectually challenging. That's one way to put it. It's pure giberish."
2,"Overfilled with the details, philosophy takes a back seat...","The wonderfully unique and important message, and philosophy, of the protagonist takes a backseat to the superfluous, neverending details of the settings in this overlong novel. It needed a better editor.It is a masterpiece, no doubt, but I had to work to get through the descriptions of everything to the plot. I felt like a reader-archeologist digging for the plot and characterizations amongst the atmosphere and descriptiveness of the novel's setting. Bravo to the concept, thumbs down to the delivery and editing."
2,Boring Book,"I wasn't crazy about this book. Two-thirds of the book is wasted describing the ""World of Tomorrow"" and it does not really begin to have a plot until that point. Otherwise, the majority of the book rambles around and describes in excruciating detail the main character's decision-making process."
2,"Drags, drags, drags - then leaves you hanging","What a wonderful imaginatively described world - then it's wonderfully, imaginatively described some more, with lots of inventive, esoteric terms for mind states - and then some more description - and then some more - with little action, then less, then less, as we wander through characters' memories, philosophies, observations . . . You get the picture. Brilliant idea, poorly educated, and, worst of all, unresolved at novel's end - you'll have to buy another book, and after that one more, to find out the resolution. And I just CAN'T labor through any more florid descriptions. So, reluctantly, I say: don't buy it."
1,Software manuals are more readable,"Others who have called this jargony and overwrought are dead-on. The result is borderline unreadable, plodding and uninteresting. If the Dune books are the zenith of unravelling a complex knot of economic, cultural and technological relationships in a compelling and interesting way, this book is the nadir.The author needs to read and reread the New Sun books by Gene Wolfe and ""The Last Legends of Earth,"" the fourth volume in A.A. Attannasio's tetralogy for lessons in elegance and subtlety as applied to describing advanced technology.The old cliche, ""Ask the man what time it is and he tells you how to build a watch,"" is an apt description of how most will feel when trying to grind through this.Moreover, this book is representative of a disturbing trend of ""review inflation"" on this site and others. Soon every novel and musical recording on the internet will be rated ""four stars"" or higher."
3,It's OK,Works as described. However a bit disappointed for the following reasons.1) although after reasonable amount of charging the light is not so bright in the night.2) There is a small hole that's used to put out the cigaretts. When I drive it's hard to put out the cigaretts with it. I had a different kind of ash tray with better design in this regard.3) The capacity could be bigger.
5,Bite-sized stories in the style of Studs Terkel,"This is a great resource and a priceless record of the immigrant experience in America. Morrison and Zabusky collected stories in people's own words and sets them down here, so we can all see first-hand just how the USA came to be such a melting pot. Stories of hardship and pride leap off the page. A terrific book to wave in the face of people who don't seem to remember that we were all immigrants at one point or another"
1,just like the episodes ont not,this book has the three begining episodes.the first episode is when ash starts out on his journey then he meets misty than brock.BUUUUTTTTTTTTT THE BOOK DOES NOT GO IN TO DETAIL AT THE BEGINING OF ONE CHAPTER IT SAYS THEY HAVE A NEW FRIEND BROCK WITH OUT TELLING HOW HE GOT THERE.THIS WAS WRITTEN SO SLOPPY.I DO NOT KNOW WHY THESE USED BOOK PRICES ARE SO CHEAP.
1,Man! This is not good.,"There were no metaphors in this book, nor was it parallelled in any way to real life. I was not impressed at all. People would be much better off reading things like Dostoevsky or Hemingway. Little children, read Jack Kerouac's On The Road if you like Pokemon!"
4,i choose you pikachu!,"This book is pretty cool. it tells the story about Ash Ketchum and pikachu and a few of the adventures they go through. I think this book was mostly aimed at younger fans, because i read it really fast.i like this series because it's based on the t.v. episodes (well they actually are the real episodes).If you want your kid(s) to read a book but can't get them to, and they like pokemon this is a good choice."
2,pokemon book#1 review,The book was ok but it wasn't my favorite. I think they left out too many episodes and they didn't put enough parts in each episode they talked about. So Ididn't like it that much.
3,Frozen Beans!,"This book is ok. The story covers the original tv show, but it skips lots of parts like when Ash gets the Boulder badge. If you are a fifth grader don't buy this book!"
3,not tonight,"I thought I'd done this before ,anyway it came in good condition unfortunatly what was described as a ""large saucer"" really doesn't fit the cup it was to fit [broke the original] SO it's a bit ""wobbly"" but I can live with it , the fuss of sending it back isn't worth .itJohn barry"
4,Great Summary for those with an accounting background,"If you have an accounting background and need a quick reference guide to refresh your memories, this is a great book. The authors also provide practical tips in boxes to remind you what to watch out for in particular circumstances. In a nutshell, it basically cramps a few years worth of accounting courses into one very compact book.For those of you who do not have an accounting background, this book will not be for you since it does not go into any great length to explain any accounting concepts. It basically assume you already know your stuff and simply needs a refresher."
4,Only one thing missing . . .,"The only thing missing from this great book is more details on enlisted uniforms. The Regs concentrate on officers' uniforms, and explicitly explain that details of enlisted uniforms isn't necessary because enlisted men take what the Government issues them, whereas officers have their stuff tailored and pay for it themselves.However, there is more than enough to make this one worth the price!"
3,digital Nude Photography,this is a good book for any beginner that has a lack of tasteful ideas. I feel that it is worth having in your personal collection as a reference
2,"Beginner's Digital Camera Book, not about Nude Photography","This is basically a digital photography book which uses nude women for the accompanying photos. If the author had chosen to use pictures of puppies and children the book would essentially be then same. That said, it's not a bad book, although somewhat basic, on digital photography. If you are looking for a book on nude photography go elsewhere."
3,A Little Too Basic,"Overall, a great book for those new to photography in general, but a little bit too basic for experienced photographers looking to break into a new genre. I wish it covered more ground, had more examples of non-traditional lighting and more info on posing."
4,The Nude Review...,"Very heplful book for beginners in the world of shooting nudes. Great suggestions with regards to models, posing, lighting, camera selections, and much, much more."
1,Lousy,"I made the mistake of believing the synopsis on this book. It is actually lousy, filled with fourth rate poems. If this volume represents the best that Encore had to offer, Alice Briley did us no favors. Alyssa A. Lappen"
1,You've got to be kidding.,"While the designs in this book provide for unlimited color and pattern combinations, many of the pages have spaces that are so tiny you'd have to use something as thin as a needle to stay inside the lines. A pencil or colored pencil sharpened lethally, barely. Markers or crayons, forget it! You've heard of large print editions? This one's microscopic."
5,No problems!,Received it promptly and it was exactly what I expected and appreciated the convenience. It saved me a lot over having it installed at the dealership.
3,Gonna stick with Hot Shine instead,"Im always trying new products and Meguiars is one of my favorites. So when a new product comes out I am one of the first to try em out. Truth be told I am fairly dissapointed in this product. I dont want to go as far as to say its a bad product. It just doesnt carry much of a shine to it. It does last longer then Meguiars Hot Shine but the results dont wow me.Im sure its good for what its meant to be, which appears to be endurability and subtleness. But for me I need more pop ... which is the catagory this product is sorely lacking."
2,Nice shine but it does sling,"Not sure how some other reviews said this stuff doesn't sling. It is a gel and slings just as much as every other gel. No more, no less and I did apply it with an applicator. It does have a high gloss and looks great. My advice is to apply a very small amount, spread it evenly and wipe down the excess. It's a gel so waiting a few hours or overnight won't make a difference.Overall, i like the look but it def 100% does sling!UPDATE: it's now a few days later and I have had to clean the side of my car every day since applying. Tires look good but wow does it sling.UPDATE 2: Tried this 5 times now. Each time I used less and less product and applied with a foam applicator. Slings like crazy. Maybe I notice it more because my car is white but to say I get sling because I applied too much is not correct. Applied so little the last time you could barely notice."
4,"Good, not great","I'd say this product was above average, but not fantastic. It did leave a moderately deep black, and if you wait for it to dry and do a couple coats it lasts longer than most I've tried.It however doesn't give the same deep shine I've seen from some other products. For a daily driver though, this stuff is great and keeps your tires looking a step above the rest on the road."
2,all the same,"all these tire shine products are the same, look great when you put it on 2 or 3 days later you can't even tell you put it on, like flashlight batteries, everyone company tells you they last long, but they still stink."
3,geeze people,"despite the people that seem to have such a narrow taste in music that they cant see the artistic style or emotion this band spills out into its music. adema is an execellent band with really good songs. i want everything this talented band puts on the shelf. nevermind that i just download it all, thats not the point."
3,Shouldn't even be considered an EP,"I dont understand why Adema even called this a CD, it was two good songs (immortal and shattered). Two ... remixes for Freaking Out and The Way You Like It. And finally, a live cut for do what you and a radio mix for giving in. So you see, only one new song, a cover from another band(nutshell) and some other ... But, immortal is a kick... song."
3,It Was OKAY,"The first 2 or 3 songs on this album are the best, but it gets weird in Adema's own way. My fav song on it is ""IMMORTAL"" because it rocks harder than any other song besides ""Nutshell"". I just think they are the best ones. At least in those songs, this band is enjoying themselves and that is pretty nice to hear along with the hard, hard energy of the cd.The weird thing about it is that Adema were doing things their own way, and yet, that almost makes it better, but it still only deserves 3 stars because of the greatness of the opening of the album. I'd say it gets a B- for it's strong effort with being good. It tried very hard, but didn't quite make it. The closing of the album was my LEAST favorite because it's like they just gave up on the good songs...or something like that. It's hard to explain. I hope this was a little helpful for ya. Hasta Lombego!{or...however you spell that word}."
1,Puh-thetic,"Nevermind how horribly inept and unoriginal this band is, you really have to just hate this band for their cover of AIC's ""Nutshell"" that appears on this disc. It really is that bad."
5,Adema Next Linkin Park,Adema has only sold 500.000 copies making them gold artist.This cd i bought because i heard he was related to Me Or Johnathan Davis of korn.So I got it and Adema has became one of my favorites.Ithink Adema is a great band that has the potenial to be the best they just need BETTER PROMOTION.These guys came out i think in 2000 i never heard of them until saw there info on a korn website.This album is great its cool most bands dont do Eps and this ones great.Heres my rankings Immortal 10/10...Shattered9/10......Nutshell 9/10........Freaking out remix 9/10.....The way you like it remix 10/10.......Do what you wanna do live 9/10......Giving in 10/10........IM GOING TO GO GET THERE FIRST ALUM RIGHT NOW SO IVE GOT TO GET OFF OF HERE BUT I THINK YOU SHOULD DO THE SAME.
4,The Way You Like It,"1st off let me start by saying that this is one of the best Ep's I heard. I mean the new songs are very good. My favorite is the Alice In Chains cover ""Nutshell"" & ""Immortal."" This CD's not as bad as people are makeing it seem. The remixes are not that bad. In fact there better then some Korn and Limp Bizkit remixes. This Cd is to hold fans over til the next album and I think that whats its doing. This Cd is buy worthy depending on the price you get for. because the prices vary.But over all this a very original peice from Adema. Mark my words this band will be very big in the near future. So if you like Adema's Self titled album then Im pretty sure you'll like this.So buy the Ep and enjoy the music."
4,Often Powerful: 4.5 Stars,"This is a very nicely produced bilingual selection of Garcia Lorca's poetry. The bilingual versions give even non-Spanish speakers a glimpse of Garcia Lorca's languge. There is a good deal of impressive poetry in this collection. I favor the earlier and later poetry. Some of the poetry from the middle of Garcia Lorca's abbreviated life exhibits more dense imagery and language, making it harder to understand."
2,Pull out the superglue!,"My sister gave me these shoes because they were a lot smaller than she expected, even though she ordered them in her size (7). I wear a smaller shoe (6.5) and they fit me exactly. The shoes are cute and VERY comfortable (they actually feel amazing considering the height of shoe). I wore the shoes for the first time today at work, on carpet, and the sole of one of the shoes is already starting to peel off. Note that I did not wear the shoes from my car in the parking lot to the office. I put them on once I arrived in the office, and I sat at my desk for the majority of the day. I'll pull out the superglue, but it's still disappointing that I have to repair brand new shoes after only wearing them once."
2,These run REALLY small,"I was SO DISAPPOINTED when I received this shoe. I ordered size 7 and when the shoe arrived, I could not even slide my foot an inch into the shoe (I am not exaggerating). My husband and I were ready to swear that they sent me the wrong size (probably a 5), but the box and the shoe were, sure enough, labeled with a 7. Consider ordering at least 1 full size (maybe even 2 sizes) bigger in this shoe. RIDICULOUS!!!"
1,BAD,This was the incorrect item and the seller never contacted me to have it returned. I was real dissapointed with it
2,power adapter review,"I purchased this power adapter for a Magellan 760 Roadmate navigator. I also ordered the connector for the navigator at the same time. The add from your recommendation had no indication of unavailablity of the part. They, after a month still have not filled the order and without the item I cannot use the power adaptor.Carl"
1,Terrible.,"I lived in Barrow in 1988 and was on hand for the rescue effort, from beginning to end. Tom Rose had a great story before him but chose to ignore it and instead created a poor work of fiction. He used real peoples names but beyond that pretty much make everything up. The nicest thing that can be said about this book is that Tom Rose took the concept of ""literary license"" and multiplied it to 1000th degree."
4,The Fiftieth Gate,"The Fiftieth Gate is a 'journey into memory' integrating the author's parent's stories of the Holocaust and their survival with historical fact. He exchanges their stories for historical facts of the Holocaust, discovering that his mother is the lone survivor from her village.Baker searches to find out the events of his own background in order to find his own identity and family background. A totally honest and thought provoking book which allows its reader to wake up and realise the disasters of human hatred in Hitler's persecution of Jews. Very upfront and in your face."
5,Ensure,My father often finds himself without an appetite. He loved the Ensure Fiber. We had difficulty finding it in the store. A great way to meet his dietary needs.
2,Mucolyxir Liquid,"Unfortunately this product did not seem to be effective. My husband only used one bottle, but there seemed to be no positive change in his symptoms."
4,Barnes does it again,"If you're a fan of Linda Barnes and her Carlotta Carlyle protagonist you will enjoy Snapshot the fifth installment in this series. I listened to the audio of this book and have to admit that reading would have been much better. I feel the audio is to easy to get distracted from. However, I love C. J. Critt and feel she does a wonderful job. Snapshot takes you into the world of hospitals and medicine and secrets they may hold. Carlotta is taken into this world by her customer who later cannot be found. Snapshot has many twist and turns (which I enjoy in a novel). Several people who could be the bad guy, and our old favorites Mooney, Gloria and Sam make appearances. Although they are not involved as much as in the previous novels. Snapshot will not let you down if you are looking for a good whodunit with a great protagonist."
3,A little tedious,"I love the Carlotta Carlyle series, they are fast paced reads. This book was a little tedious with the hospital setting and way too detailed medical descriptions. The premise was odd but interesting. Not my fave but i enjoyed it."
3,fast pointe class,I only have seen the VHS version of this DVD. The problem with this tape is that she only demonstrates the barre exercises on one side so I had to rewind to do the other. The combinations are beautiful but the instruction is to fast and inadequate.
4,Guide to the Goth-Mages,"This book brings together all the ideas surrounding the Hollow Ones and tries to expand them beyond the 'Goth-Mage' stereotype. The book has plenty of information on history, philosophies, and rotes for the group.The book is a good resource for players and storytellers who want more information beyond the material provided in 'Outcasts: A Guide to Pariahs'. The information is useful and is presented in a clear fashion. The cover art is great and the new spells are useful. The only things I didn't like about the book are the templates. Most of them are based off of sci-fi characters.Despite it's efforts to show that the Hollow Ones are more than Goth-Mages, the group still comes out looking more Goth than anything else."
3,wash brush,I have a pressure washer for washing the car so I only using this item as a telescoping scrub brush which it works perfect as . I have a prime account and this item shipped free second day arrived on time . Over all a execellent buy 2 stars missing cause I never used the water attachment feature .
2,"Weak plot, characterizations. I still liked it.","I believe the reason romances get such a bad wrap is because of plot, characterization weaknesses. I felt like the author had something else to do and wanted to finish the story as soon as possible to get to it! The plot could have been so much more flushed out, and therfore, more enjoyable. What about the Cuba angle? Why have him go there if its not important to the story. He could have traveled to Minnesota! The characters had no depth and I never felt like I knew them. How did his sisters feel? For that matter, what were their names? Any nieces/nephews? What happened at the bridal shower? Did she have one? Did Jemery have any friends that would create a conflict for him? This story lacked significant conflict. Although, it had the seeds for it. There could have been so much more to this story. But what I really want to know is...is that Janet Jackson on the cover!!!!!!!!"
4,good fast read,"This was a ""cute"" story. It was a nice read if you've read all the other interracial books like ""no commitment required"", ""once in a blue moon"" etc and are looking for another book.The problem with the book is that you can read it in less than one day; being that it was only about 135 pages long and in somewhat large print.I had somewhat of a problem with the lead female crying so much of the time. The lead male did seam a little too perfect but I didn't mind him being so great.The story was overall satisfying because I wanted something that would make me feel good and like a good man is attainable.It was ms white's first book. I would like to see more from her and agree with the other reader, in that I hope she writes a sequel."
2,Shades of Desire,"I read this book twice. While Ms. White should be commended for exploring the topic of interracial relationships, this particular book lacked depth of the characters and the relationship. Jasmine seemed to be intrigued w/sex with a white man and looked for affirmation for her relationship from her friends and family. She jumped quickly into their relationship and the subsequent engagement and wedding went quickly without a true development of either Jasmine or Jeremy's relationship outside of sex. I think people who know about the trials of interracial/intercultural relationships would ask that authors steer clear of stereotypes and focus a bit more on the reality of interracial romance."
2,Nothing to rave about,"I remember reading this book and I have to say that I didn't like it at all. It was more like watching a soap opera that you can't stand. I thought it would be a great read because there are very few books that have interractial themes between black women and white men. And this book didn't do anything to exite me. If you want to read a good interracial book, try Sandra Kitt's ""Color of Love"" and Pamela Leigh Starr's ""Fate""."
2,i could have written this book myself....,"I found the book way too short and it sounded like something that i could write myself. The author could have made this book a lot better, but it was okay, not even close to great, but okay."
1,Too Rushed. Not very Romantic,"This story was not very capturing. It started off too fast. There was no building up of characters and the meeting and subsequent relationship between Jasmine and Jeremy was not believeable. There should have been more ""chase"" between the both of them so that the relationship built up to a climax so that you couldn't wait to see what would happen between the two of them. I was not very intrigued by the storyline, and I only finished reading it because I always finish what I start. Despite all of the lovemaking, I do not think it was a very romantic story."
1,WORST BOOK EVER!!!!,"I recently bought this book, and I must say, I found it terribly dreadful getting through the first chapter. The author is by far the worst romance writer ever! After meeting for the first time, the main character is ready to spend the rest of her life with Jeremy. Feeling arise much too early in the book. By chapter 3, after only one date!, Jermey is already meeting the parents. The love scenes are quick and lack any passion. The plot is weak, even for a 100 page book. Best advice I can give--Don't waste your time with this book. Better yet, stay away from any of this author's work."
2,Way to simple,"This is my first interracial book, and I found the storyline very simple and too neat. I hope for an intense romance with in-dept characters. I was very disappointed especially after reading the pervious reviews. If you just want to read something that isn't particularly thought provoking this is the book for you. However if you are an avid romance reader who enjoys a steamy plotline with great character development don't bother."
1,To Simple,"The best part of this book was the cover two very attractive people. However the chacters where not at all explored. They where so one demintional no depth at all . I mean within 134 very redundent pages these two meet fell in love and married so unrealistics. If I had to read the term why are you with this ""white Man"" again I would have earled."
1,Save your money,"I read this book in a day, but not because it was good. I read it quickly in the hopes that it would get better. The characters and the plot were unbelievable. The heroine was annoying and the story (minus the sex scenes) read like the novel was intended for teenagers instead of adults.I love interracial romances and wish that more are published. If you love IRs too, save your money and check out Pamela Leigh Starr's ""Fate"" and Seressia Glass's ""No Commitment Required."" Excellence begins and ends with these two authors' impressive works."
2,It could have been better,"Shade of Desire was missing something, it lacked agood story line. Jasmine was so eager to sleep with this man it made me sick. Being a black woman I didn't relate to this woman at all. The book was ok but it just lack that something. The story was over before it begin, we didn't have time to get to know the characters before they were sleeping together. Every thing moved too fast for me."
2,Cheesy,"The characters in this book move way too fast. It seems like they go from dating to getting married in about a week. Nice try though, and it's almost worth reading for the cheesy dialogue and situations."
2,Easy read but also easy to put down.,The story was a little choppy to me and I was as interested in it as I thought I would be.
1,Disappointed,"I waited a long time to read this book, and I was truly disappointed. It took me two hours to read and the characters had no meaning to me. Great subject matter, totally unfocused writing."
2,I really did not feel this book as a young black woman.,"This book lacked a plot, heavily. I think it would have been less drowsy if there was some adventure or even danger in the story line. Also, I find it hard to believe that she would have jumped into bed with him that quick. The black women I know, wouldn't. All in all I can tell that it was the authors first book. I hope she does better in her future novels."
1,This book seemed to be thrown together!!,"This book was really, really missing something. It lacked romance. I couldn't get past the first chapter. The first person viewpoint left me confused. It lacked true heart tugging passion. I saw every sterotype known to man in the firt chapter. I've read MUCH!!! better."
1,To Simple,"The best part of this book was the cover two very attractive people. However the chacters where not at all explored. They where so one demintional no depth at all . I mean within 134 very redundent pages these two meet fell in love and married so unrealistics. If I had of read the term why are you with this ""white Man"" again I would have earled."
1,Very disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this book. The characters were very weak and never fully developed. You could not really relate to either characters problems or issues. I would not even consider this book ""light reading"". Skip it!"
1,Not enough information,"I was a bit dissapointed , i know its my fault , i didn't pay to much attention to the tag that is not the color they show the one you are ordering, it SHOULD be the same thing you're looking physically the thing you're gonna buy!!!i saw this beautifull gray/orange stripes, and got GREEN /WHITE STRIPÈS.its very easy to put a picture of the product!!regards"
3,Useful for Book Reports,"I found the ending of the book to be somewhat exciting because it left the audience wondering whether or not Wanda would ever come back. The story is about a girl named Wanda who claims to have one hundred dresses, but no one believes her. She ends up moving to a different town and leaves her school. Throughout the story, there are two girls who go about trying to find Wanda. When they return to school, they come to find that Wanda had won the picture contest. Her picture was made up of one hundred pictures of one hundred dresses and when two particular students looked closely at the pictures, they found themselves in the dresses. I read this book for a book report and it isn't one that I would typically read however, I enjoyed reading it. I hope you also enjoy reading The Hundred Dresses."
3,This is a book about a not so popular girl and two bullies,This is a story about a little poor girl named Wanda that no one pays atention to.Also two girls that always make fun of her until a drawing contest wicth changes the story.
3,A Fabulous Book Review By Megan Cross,"This story was probably more entertaining than informing.I think the author was trying to make a point ""Treat others as you want to be treated.""I rated this book a 3 because I didn't love, but I did like it very well.There weren't any parts I believe needed to be changed.If I were going to write this story it would probably be the the same way.It was a good book.I would recommend it to anyone."
2,I thought it was boring.,"This month my class read a book called ""The Hundred Dresses."" I thought it was boring and slow moving. I thought this because the descriptions where long and involved. If this was on a scale from 1 to 5 (5 being the most) I would rate it 2. In the story, two girls named Maddie and Peggy tease a girl in their class. Her name was Wanda Petronski. They tease her about shoes, dresses and anything else they can think of. After Wanda wins a contest for drawing 100 dresses, she leaves school. Her father gives the class a note saying, ""I want Peggy and Maddie to have two drawings of their choice."" This leaves the two girls feeling quite differently about Wanda. The only fun part about the book was at the end when my class got to make 100 dresses out of fabric, paper, glue, etc. This made me feel quite different about the book."
2,So many dresses your eyes will fall out,It's about a girl who no one really likes. Everyday they ask her how many dresses do you have and she says a 100. No one believes her till she gives away all of her 100 dresses.
3,Bittersweet,"When I read this book with my children (5 and 7) they did struggle to follow the story at times. I found it to be a good story. Some have commented that the abusers ""get away"" with how they treat the Polish girl but I found it to be realistic. Her response to love her persecutors instead of demanding justice was a good response. I thought it painted a lovely picture of how forgiveness can heal, even when it is not deserved."
5,This book may cause tears!!,"Ron Clark mentioned in his book, ""Essential 55,"" that he reads, ""The Hundred Dresses,"" to his class to help his students understand and not allow bullying. This is a great book. I had tears and so did a lot of my students. This book is an easy read and easy to understand. The story helps-demonstrate to the reader that no matter how poor you are, you don't have to look or act poor.-shows the reader that a bully is not always someone that gets in your face and calls you names.-and reveals that watching someone being bullied without helping sometimes makes you just a guilty as the bully.This book has characters that appear real and reflect on their decisions. Please remember to have tissue!"
4,Read This Book it's the Best!,The book I read was The Hundred Dresses by Eleanor Estes. It was about a girl named Wanda who was being teased and handled it in a strange way. The book displayed Diversity when Peggy was saying that Wanda was poor. I liked this book because I learned a lot about teasing. By A.B.
4,Do you like dresses? This is the book for you!,"The book I read was The Hundred Dresses by Eleanor Estes. It was about a girl named Wanda who was shy and got teased. Diversity means Difference in language, dress, food, where parents and grandparent were born, and race, religion, are not only allowed but accepted as important. Diversity happened when Wanda moved here. She had a different language, she dressed different and she had no money. I liked this book because it is about how people don't like to be teased."
4,The Hundred Dresses Review,"The Hundred DressesThis is a great book! It is about three girls. Their names are Wanda, Maddie, and Peggy. Wanda lives up on a hill, and is not that wealthy. At school some girls tease her about having 100 dresses. Wanda said she does, but does she?I like this book because it tells you, if you like being treated nicely be nice to others."
5,this is a wonderful book,"I enjoyed reading this book again as I had years ago with my son. Bought it for a nine year old girl and hope she enjoys it as much. A beautiful, touching story with a great message."
1,This book was very boring,I thought this book was one of the most boring books I ever read. I usually love to read but this one was horrid.
1,Ugly Story,"An incredibly ugly depiction of a little Polish girl and her classmates making fun of her. Promotes the stereotypical ""Dumb Pollack"" without showing any betterment of the little girl's situation. I found this book very offensive. I had ordered it as a gift for a little girl, but this book is wildy inappropriate in that there is no moral resolution at the end. The tormenters get away with their harassment, and there is only suffering for the Polish girl. The only thing it would teach a child is that you can get away with being bigoted and rude to others. Too bad Amazon doesn't allow for a zero rating because this because deserves it."
3,It was GREAT!,"The story of The Hundred Dresses is about a girl named Wanda Petronski. She lived up on a hill called Boggins Heights. The story is about people teasing Wanda by asking her how many dresses she had and she would say, ""I have a hundred dresses."" when she only had one fadded blue dress. One day her dad pulls her out of class and decides that they are moving to the big city where no one would tease her. I thought it was a great book. It taught me that just because someone does not have a mother and is different that doesn't mean that they can't be good at anything. I recomend this book for kids ages five to eight because it teaches kids that you shouldn't tease other kids, and treat everybody with respect."
5,A Great Childhood Story,"Recently, in my high school Literature class, I was asked to read a short story and write a paper on it. While flipping through the pages of ""A Newberry Christmas"", I stumbled upon this story that I remembered from so many years ago (actually about 10) What a wonderful story that teaches us all, old and young, about the way we treat others and the results it brings."
5,The Hundred Dresses,This book arrived on time and was in very good condition. Thank you for your excellent customer service.
5,Great Second/Third Grade Fiction,"Wanda, who has no mother and lives with her father, wears the same dress to school but claims she has 100 beautiful dresses in her closet at home. She is teased by other students. Wanda moves away and the truth behind her hundred dresses is revealed. Is it too late to make amends?(...)"
3,The kids teased Wanda.,"Hundred Dresses There was a little girl named Wanda.She was lonely, sad , & quiet.When it was recess she went to a brick wall & leaned against it.There were two other girls named Peggy & Maddie.Wanda did not like getting teased by the other kids. Peggy was the most popular girl in the school & she was the most liked kid in her class. Maddie was thoughtful & shy.Peggy & other kids teased Wanda the most.Wanda's teacher would call on her and say, ""It's your turn to read !'' said Miss Mason.Wanda would not read at all & the other kids thought she was dumb or something ?The other kids called Wanda a hollar polock.Wanda had a hundred dresses all linded up in her closet. Maddie said ''She must have liked us after all ''I liked the book and if you read it I hope you like it !!!Allie T. age 9"
5,Beautiful Story!!,"This is a beautiful story!! It is about a little girl who immigrates from Poland to America with her brother and her father. She is met with some unkind treatment from students in her class. Eventually, they realize their behavior was inappropriate. I teach first grade and my students LOVED this story! It is a longer book and I had to read it to my students and I updated some of the terms but it was a great culmination to a unit on Poland. My students felt so badly for poor little Wanda in the story. This story is also an EXCELLENT book on bullying. The kids seem to understand the feelings of Wanda. It can also be a great addition to the 100th day of school for grades 1-6. My kids created 100 dresses and we displayed them in the hall. The boys and girls alike were eager to complete the 100 different dresses. Buy the Activity Guide too!!"
5,Great book!,"The Hundred Dresses is about Wanda, Maddie and Peggie. In the story Wanda is struggling to get some frends. One day Wanda says something in a effort to get frends. That follows her for the whole school year. Then something bad happens but I better not tell the story.I would recommend this story because it has alot of twists in it. I wouldn't recommend it because there are alot of people in it and it gets confusing. It also has hard words. People who are under eight shouldn't read this book."
3,A Hundred Dresses - Not,"I was really excited to find the book I thought I had read a dozen times when I was in the third grade in 1958. However, more than the illustrations have been added. This is not the same story and I think someone should say, words have been deleted and others added. This story has been revised and I am very disappointed.The reason I liked the story so much as a young girl was because I was a child who always befriended the less popular students. Often times, I was ""The Wanda's"" only friend. In the third grade her name was Hazel for me. I was disappointed with the changes to the story because the story meant so much to me. It was a classic in its own time for a third grader. I would like very much to read the original story."
5,A wonderful lesson for all colors shapes and size of people,"It teaches not to judge a book by the cover. Don't dislike others because they're different.Just learn to communicate, and you'll find that a dress can be yellow or orange, but it's still a DRESS!"
4,Read this good book it's the best.,The book read was The Hundred Dresses by Eleanor Estes. It's about a little girl who is shy and kind of lies. The book displayed Diversity because she wears what she wants to. I liked this book because it very serious.
3,"A book not just for girls, boys love it too!","This is a wonderful story about a young girl named Wanda.She gets picked on by two girls named Peggy and Maddie. Peggy is mean to Wanda all the time and teases her because Wanda says she has a hundred dresses. Maddie picks on Wanda too but starts to feel sorry for her. I think this story could teach other kids that have similar problems ways to deal with these issues.This book was funny, sad and taught me a lot of good lessons."
5,An classic that's endured,"I still remember the tears that trickled down my face--the first I'd ever shed over a book--when I read ""The Hundred Dresses"" in my 4th-grade classroom in 1959. I empathized deeply with Wanda but also with her tormentor too-late-made-ashamed. A moving book, more pertinent than ever in this post-Columbine era of heightened sensitivity to the lasting damage that can be done by children's teasing of the different. And a story beautifully rendered in both words and pictures, to boot."
5,Great book for young girls,This is a very sweet story about a little girl who was teased at school because she wore the same worn out dress every day. It has a good moral lesson and teaches girls that there are more important things than looking pretty on the outside = you need to be pretty on the inside too.
5,"A classic novel about self-knowledge, courage, and integrity","Maddie may be poor, but she's glad she isn't as poor as Wanda. Wanda is an immigrant. Her family lives in a bad part of town. And, every single day, Wanda wears the same faded, blue dress. When Maddie's classmates start picking on Wanda, Maddie is too afraid to stand up for what she knows is right. After all, as poor as Maddie is, she could be next.The Hundred Dresses is a surprisingly emotional story about doing the right thing--even when it isn't popular. The simple language of the story makes us feel Maddie's heartache about making a mistake she may not be able to set right. The Hundred Dresses won the Newbery Medal in 1945."
2,"Uncomfortable, and VERY large","Definitely try this shoe on first at a store to find your size, it runs extremely large, and thus your foot's placement is off which leads to it being very uncomfortable."
5,Happy Toes,"Great leather, great build quality, comfortable soles. I love Allen Edmunds shoes and these are no exception. I have another pair that I sent back to AE for refurbishment after two years of almost daily wear so you can be sure that they wear as well as they look!"
3,Buy Allen Edmonds in the Store Instead,"Amazon is great for buying books and music, but I would not recommend it for buying Allen Edmonds shoes. I (my husband) has purchased Allen Edmonds shoes at local retailers and prefers this brand because they are well-built and are made in narrow sizes. They usually fit like a glove. But this pair, purchased on Amazon, not so much. Although he is unhappy with his purchase, he is not sure that the shoes are at fault. The recommendation simply is this; if you want a pair of Allen Edmonds, don't buy them on Amazon. Go to a retailer, try the shoe on, walk around and then decide."
2,Sized too Big,"I have been successful ordering 11.5 wide oxford lace-up shoes from Johnston & Murphy or Bostonian for the last 10 years. I happen to be hitting a dead patch with zappo's and shoebuy in trying to find a new pair of casual shoes to go with the dockers, which is what I wear a lot, so I figured I would take a crack at these since they were cheaper than any other web site. The shoe is too long - I have about 3/4 inch dead space between my big toe and front of shoe - and the heel area is way too big. There is actually a bit of open space all around the heel. I assume the heel size will only change if I order a regular width, but my big toe is already pressed up against the side of the shoe, so a narrower size will get me in the situation I was in with regular sizes. Too bad, it is obviously a very nice quality shoe, but the last it is built on is weird (for me anyway). I may have to go to an AE store and have them figure out what last my foot is compatible with and then try to order online."

4,WoW Wow,Great box set loaded with matches! This is how a box set should be done. Give the consumers their moneys worth! YES Sir! there are plenty of matches in this set to keep you entertained for hours! All wrestling sets should have 4 DVDs in them! This truely shows Jeff Jarrett at his best!
5,great dvd set,"This is a great dvd set, I highly recommend it to any fan of pro wrestling past or present, I have found new respect for Jeff Jarrett after watching this."
2,not ready for Prime Time wresting promotion and its star!,"Until the recent arrival of Mick Foley...I've taken only a passing interest in TNA. Sting is of course a classic figure and Kurt Angle is the real deal but its founder Jeff Jarrett always struck me as a guy who's position was due to his well position as founder and not due to his charisma or wrestling prowess. This DVD set , which I purchased out of curiosity and to find out what I wasn't getting only solidified my opinion that Jarrett is a second tiered performer. I can't really remember any 4 DVD set dedicated to a performer in any field that is so second rate..I guess if Andrew Ridgley of WHAM fame released a box set of his solo work we'd have a comparison to this. Jarrett should be the wrestler that goes on to put over new stars instead of borrowing shtick from The Honky Tonk Man and putting himself over and over and over.With so many amazing wrestling DVDs on the market I can't recommend this set to any serious fan."
4,Awesome Product for the price,I thought of buying the blue tooth headset for a while the prices are so high and the quality is always compromised then I bought this product for 3o odd bucks I have been using it for 2months now no problem expect when it is windy it picks up th noise otherwise nice product for the product I recommend people to buy this one.
4,Great Headset,"Though this product is probably not the absolute best bluetooth headset, it is one of the best I have ever used. It is comfortable, great audio, and is a lot clearer than my other headsets. I would strongly reccomend this headset to most anyone. It has a fixed ear piece, so if you have a sensetive ear, it might not work the best for you."
3,Not Comfortable at all,"Pros:- Good Sound Quality- Fits tightly in your ear- Talk time is good- Easy to useCons:- HURTS YOUR EAR WITHIN 5 MINUTESOverall, for the price you can't beat it. However, it did hurt my ear."
4,"Good headset, value for money","This is a good product, sound clarity is good, doesnt feel cheap, connects readily to my Razr V3c. No disconnects and call drops. It doesnt hurt even if you wear it for a long time."
4,Not a bad value for price,The headset sometimes gets very staticky and I'm still trying to figure out why. The phone isn't far away for it to be distance even when fully charged. But if you ignore that it works pretty well for the price and the look is shnazzy too.
1,Delivery Problems,"Haven't received this item. Fedex says they delivered to the local post office, but post office says they don't have it."
2,Cheap but not so good,"I bought this headset to use it with my Blackberry Curve 8320. I also tried to use this with two different 8320s. Not only the sound was not good quality, the range was also really bad. Anything more than 3-4 feet if there is your body between the phone and the headset the quality of sound would go crappy/choppy.I also tried to pair this with my iMac and no luck. I can hear, but I cannot talk. The microphone was not recognized at all.So I don't recommend it to anybody."
3,keeping my fingers crossed,I had to replace this item 1 time before 30 days. I hope it will keep. My father says he loves it!
2,Headset for all Bluetooth Enabled Phones?,Plantronics Explorer 340 Blutetooth sounds good and looks good. Problem is my LG CU720 didn't find it. My sister's Samsung SGH-A707 also didn't find it. I'm not happy with it.
3,"sounds good, but uncomfortable & poor controls","I am not happy with this Plantronics headset, not because of sound quality (it has GREAT SOUND QUALITY) but because of the following three things:1- UNCOMFORABLE to wear. It loops over your ear (and the plastic is not adjustable) and to keep it on there it sort of locks on your ear stub (whatever it's called, LOL) and it gets uncomfortable after a ten minutes; otherwise it will fly off!2- Awkward and COUNTERINTUITIVE controls - I think it is poor design to have to hold it down for two seconds to make a call (using voice), why not just tap it? Two seconds is a long time when driving. Redialing - forget it, tap twice they say, but I only got the rhythm right a few times. Ending a call I have transferred it more than once to my phone by mistake.3- CAN'T PICK UP CALL-WAITING! The whole reason I have a headset is so that I can drive hands-free; I am not going to fiddle with the phone to accept another call.I used it with an LG VX8600 by the way."
3,"Ok, if you keep your phone in your pocket.....","Pros:*Great sound quality,rarely have trouble hearing the caller*Callers never complain of too much background noise*As long as your phone is VERY near, limited/no static*Pretty decent battery lifeCons:*Hurt my ear a bit at first...couldn't wear it for very long*HORRIBLE radius....I can't even walk 3 feet away from my phone without experiencing MAJOR static....very annoying*Weird, and difficult to operate controls. I'm a 25 year old, pretty tech savvy gal, and even I could never quite figure out the buttons on this thing...Overall...ok, but certainly not great."
3,it's ok,"This headset is clear on both ends of the conversation, it's ez to pair, & it works all the time (as it doesn't keep disconnecting like some headsets). The major problem is comfort--it's not."
2,When it works-- it is great,"I have used this for about 3 weeks and when it works, about 25% of the time it is awsome. But the other 75% of the time it is horrible. 75% of the time the person I am calling asks if I calling from inside a well or complains about lots of background noise. The background noise complaint, admittedly is when I am in my car but I have the windows rolled up and the radio off.Also sometimes calls are unlistenable on my end due to static.I always have the phone within 5 feet of the ear piece.This is my first Bluetooth headset so I don't know if others are any better. I bought this one to use in the car since soon my state will require such a unit while driving. This is not what I expected. Perhaps one with a mouthpiece that is closer to your mouth would be better."
3,Background noise was just too much,"The 340 is very easy to use and fits fine, however, the background noise for the people who I called was so extreme even in quiet areas that I had to return it. I purchased the 520 which has a background noise diffuser and I am much happier."
2,Below expectation,"Pro's:- quick set up- comfortable- average sound quality- hands freeCon's- will never reach 2 feet away from phone without making conversation impossible, due to hiss- charger connects poorly to headset, charging very difficult- the same button is used for power (on/off press) and volume control (up / down), making it easy to end conversation instead of adjusting volume- ear fit is cumbersome"
4,"So Far, So Good","The headset was delivered as promised and, so far, has performed well; I have hopes for it over the long run."
5,Great extract at a reasonable price,"The coffee taste is exactly what we hoped for. Previously we used to make strong expresso coffee for making cakes, the problem is the dilution that resulted ruined the cake texture. Now we add a little essence and we get full flavored coffee cake with the original texture my mother used to achieve. We bought the 8oz size to balance value and shelf life.Our experience with this supplier is outstanding, shipped quickly and after sales assistance is exceptional. We certainly recommended them to our friends and family and will buy more flavorings from them again."
3,Lightweight Intro to the World of Fakes,"""Museum of Hoaxes"" is a relatively short book collecting some of the most infamous hoaxes of the past 2,000 years. Everything within is given a similar, cursory treatment. That would be acceptable if there were more illustrations; I was surprised to see just how few plates exist in a book dedicated to hoaxes. Without illustrations, many of the hoaxes (such as the Chess Machine) are difficult to fully comprehend. The result is as superficial as a Saturday morning noncredit course at a community college.Still, I'm glad I bought the book. It *is* a fun read, and a good introduction to the world of hoaxing. I plan to lend it out to my students in order to encourage them to develop skeptical thinking. I expected more coming from the creator of the Museum of Hoaxes website, but the book succeeds within its own modest limits.For an equally poppy but far more comprehensive look at a related area, check out ""Too Good to be True"" by Brunvand."
3,Not Enough of a Good Thing,"I enjoyed reading this book, but I found myself wishing that it had more hoaxes and less background information. I ended up skipping the first page or two of each chapter to get to the interesting stuff - and the hoaxes are interesting, and inspirational!"
1,Not enough detail or organization.,"THE MUSEUM OF HOAXES is a book based on a website collecting a variety of tall tales, con games, fantastic stories and urban legends. The problem with the book is that the haphazard way the stories are put together and their general brevity works on a website, but are far from acceptable in a book. Very little investigation is done into the actual circumstances of each hoax and the prose lacks any variation or even a good sense of humor. The best thing about this book is that it might pique a reader's interest to investigate some of the stories behind these little glimpses into mankind's collective gullibility. Other than that, I can't find any reason to recommend this ""web book."""
3,this book...,.this book had too many details about blood in it.i got sick to the stomach. this book was really good except for that so i'd still read it if i were you.
4,a disapointing book,I thought this book was gonna rock but it was less than the average fear street book. (the average fear street book is 5 stars)
2,What a gay song?,"I really like the old jazz sound but i get annoyed with her oversinging every word. Plus, this song is so freakin' gay. Title of song Ain't No Other Man ok. I'm gay but i still wouldn't be caught dead listening to this average song. It's like the gay titled Hillary Duff movie The Perfect Man. Come on. Don't business marketing reps with fancy degrees know anything abou marketing a name to a tangible or intangible product. This song isn't that catchy anyways. I'll stick with Xtina's Beautiful Valentin and Peter Rauhofer club mixes from 3 years ago."
4,Very handy,"I bought this before a recent trip to Berlin and Vienna. It was very helpful, I'd pull it out before going in to a store/shop, find the phrase(s) I needed and then use my awful German on the poor people working there. The dictionary at the back was a big help as well and I appreciated that there wasn't a lot of talk about grammar and word rules; I wasn't try to discuss Goethe with the locals, just not get lost on the UBahn. My one complaint: not enough specific sections for going out to the theater/opera/concert or doing much of anything besides drinking and eating."
2,Doesn't wipe up water,"This barely absorbs any water, and doesn't ring much out when you try. It's like using a notebook to clean up a spill."
5,Truly Enlightening,"It's good to see an alcoholic turn their life around, and even better to read how they did it. D.A. Dickens has seen the worst addiction has to offer, and I am sure many addicts/alcoholics can relate to his manifold troubles. They would definitely be interested in reading how Mr. Dickens picked up the broken pieces of his life before going on to begin true recovery. Three books later, his progress is duly noted. I recommend this book for anyone caught in the cage of addiction."
1,A Waste of Effort,"Cendyne remarkets these drives so they seem to come from failed companies. Mine was noisy, never wrote, stopped reading 2 day after I got it. Cendyne support is only by email and has a long turnaround. The instructions were poor also."
3,Okay for budget users,"CD recodable drives are very useful and convenient. I still do not understand why people are making zip drives and such. This is the future. Also, the price is great. Most cost more than this. However, there are problems that lower it from the five star level. It only writes CD-Rs at 4x. New drives can write at 12x. At 4x, writing a CD takes over 15 minutes. That can be very tedious. Also, this drive is internal. Those of you without a lot of computer knowledge should NOT buy this. Internal drives are not too easy to install. You can have a professinal do it, but it costs around 50 dollars. That is unwise. Unless you know how to install, you should buy an external drive. If you do have the knowledge, you are probably more than a casual user-- get a faster drive."
4,No Problem Drive,After using this drive for 6 months I have to report not a problem has cropped up. Every disc I have tried has worked without a hitch. The enclosed Nero 5 software makes burning very easy. The documentation is sparse but all in all this is good drive.
1,Really not worth the Money,"For the price, this drive would be a good deal for any old system. The only problem being that it doesn't perform. It was easy to put in, but once it was, it just sat there. a good 4x drive should take around 15 min. to burn a cd, but this was more like an hour. If you plan on using the drive once a month or two, it would be fine. But any more than that and you might as well spend the extra money. This one would frustrate most users."
3,Sport Skirt,"Skirt was not made from a very durable material for the price and of course now its on sale. I wasn't happy with the quality, but daughter wanted to keep it."
2,Cute book. Strange ending.,"Illustrations are cute. Story seems a bit child-inappropriate with it being a love story. However, I like that it teaches that a yellow beaked penguin and blue beaked penguin make a green beaked penguin (color mixing and genetics), but then the green beaked penguin becomes insecure about it's beak color. This issue is resolved in a strange and unsatisfying way on the last page by the dad distracting the baby penguin with an unclear trick. Seems like a nice opportunity to embrace differences but the author missed it. I have not read the other books and wonder if that would have helped."
2,BAD,"This doll is ugly!!!But, that doesn't really matter because there are more serious things than that like,that this doll shows her stomach! Is that what you want your kids to learn, is that showing their stomachs is cool and fun? I think not!"
2,Barbie now has tattoos??,"My daughter wants this so badly for Christmas. She shows it to me each time we're out. I know ""Fairytopia"" is the next Barbie movie slated for release, but this doll surely pales next to the gorgeous dolls from The Princess & the Pauper. The doll has what look like tattoos, and she's not wearing a whole lot. I know it's supposed to be a fairy, but I'm not real excited about this new look. Even though my daughter wants this, I won't be buying it. Mattel, stick to what has worked - I sure hope your Fairytopia movie looks better than this doll."
1,TA!,"TwistedGrrl58 i soooo agree with you. Bratz are much better in everything....BARBIE IS OLD! No one likes her anymore.I luv Bratz; i have 5 PLUS a motorcycle and TONZ of accessories. Bratz have cooler clothes, and are based on teen fashion...So in conclusion, BRATZ ROCK AND BARBIE DOESNT!!!!!"
4,Great Fun,"My daughter loves fairies, and all things magical. This set of dolls is a great toy to help her imagination soar. I love the fact that the the concept for this doll hasn't been broken. Fairies and make believe are so much fun."
3,Undergraduate Course Textbook,"We've just finished at college from the first part of this book dealing with momentum. In this review, I am talking from undergraduate prospective. The book is not good for self study, as the book relays on a LOT of math, and a little given to explain the CONCEPTS behind it. Also, there is a lot of assumptions during the course of the book which sometimes aren't clear and not explained very well for undergrad.I had two professors, one of them has long experience in the subject, whom let the book easy to read because of the examples he had, the ideas behind the ASSUMPTIONS (very important in the book), and concepts behind the math equations. The other one lack the experience which led to view the book as the MATH course.All in all, if you have a good college instructor you'll enjoy the book. Other than this, I wouldn't recommend for self study. I would recommend Frank White (fluid mechanics) as I am reading it right now to fill the gaps."
1,A poor replacement for the original,The original BSL (red cover) edition contained a wealth of information and detailed derivations of each method. This new book is quite pathetic when compared to the original. Very little theoretical background and development is presented. Most of the useful reference material has been eliminated. Don't waste your money on this book. Buy the original.
2,not good for bachellor's students,"Very complex and hard to follow. Definately for a more advanced student. My professor made us by it because he is a grouchy man who thought we were trying to obtain a master's degree...which we were not. I hope to never have to see this book again, at least until I get through the basics."
2,"If you don't have Chemical Eng background, it is not good for you!!","HiI got this book in 2009 as it was required by a course I took. Unfortionatly, I bought later other fundamental books because this one assumes you have strong background specially in Chemical Engineering. If you have background other than Chemical Eng, this book is not designed for you. You'll spend a lot of hours trying to figure out how examples have been solved. You'll know that after you get some leveling from other basic books.For Chemical Engineers, this book is their holy one."
5,Get this classic,"The first edition of this book was published in 1960, and was an absolute classic in the field of heat and mass transfer and viscous flow. I had given up on getting it, since it was so old, when this 2nd edition came out. It's a good graduate level text, very readable and usable with a wealth of solutions for real world problems. Take the opportunity to get this book before it goes out of print again."
3,Hard to understand,"Sometimes this book is understand, but other times it just seems like it's written in a foreign language... Even though this is my major and what I'm learning, it's hard to muck through."
3,"review of wiley, will update after reading","I read the review about different printings and bought it from textbookamazing. I fully expected an early printing for that price, but amazingly! it was the 11th printing. 11 printings? do they have any editors on staff? I will write an informed review at the end of the semester"
1,Worthless good luck,This book is one of the most difficult ones to understand. Sequence is not good. I dont know why professors love it. It is definitely not undergrad level understanding. Good Luck!
2,Poor Book,"If you're an expert on Chemical Engineering, it would be a great book. But then, one wouldn't be buying a book about it. To try and learn from this book is impossible unless you can understand concepts of Chemical Engineering from reading equations. It is simply a big book of deriving equations. No explanations whatsoever."
4,Difficult but very good,"This book was very difficult to understand on first pass through for my classes in Fluid Mechanics. However I have used it several times as a reference and each time I read it I seem to get more and more out of it. Requires a very good undertanding of vector calculus, but the examples are very helpful and are general enough that you can apply the principles learned to other situations."
5,A classic text in a new edition.,"Having worn out my original copy, purchased almost 40 year ago,the new edition includes much new material presented in a clearand understandable format as well as numerous well chosen problems and examples. An essential reference to all thoseinterested in transport phenomena."
2,What should be expected from people who take Forty years.,"While the first edition was the seminal standard, I don't see how the second edition can be considered the same. First of all just look at the back cover, that's glaring. The numeraters and denomenaters in the differential expressions are reversed from what they should be. Such things make me hesitant to trust any of the rest of this text. If nothing else 40 years is too long for a single edition to be used. McCabe & Smith is about to come out with their 7th edition in since about the same time as the 1st of this one."
4,Good product,I gave this bed skirt a quick iron when I took it out of the package and it fit great on my queen size bedframe. It drapes down nicely and reaches to just a couple centimeters above the floor.Be careful when ironing not to iron the white part (the part that lays under your mattress and is not part of the canvas skirt material) -- this white material should not be ironed and you will burn a hole right through it!
4,Good for the price,"I bought this watch for my eldest daughter (9yrs old), she uses it every where she goes and never takes it off. She swims 4 hours per week, plays basketball and climbs often. It takes a bit of knocks, but as the old saying was...""It takes a licking but keeps on ticking"".Con:Only problem was that it appeared to have some malfunction in the begining, like abattery problem. I'm not sure why but the screen just kept going blank."
3,Take a lickin,Excellent watch and service and shipping was great.I would not hesitate to buy again..
2,not what I expected,This watch is bigger that I thought it would be. It is also very difficult to program. Make sure to keep the instructions!
4,Nice stool,"I bought this stool for potty training. The steps were a nice height. It's a very nice looking stool, it doesn't look all tacky or cheap like many of the plastic ones, or even some of the painted wood ones. However, since it was used for potty training, it took some... abuse, if you know what I mean. It doesn't look like it did when I bought it a few years ago. But, it still looks nice. In some bathrooms we have used it in, keeping the bottom step pulled out makes it big and interferes with the door opening. We actually just keep the bottom pushed in all the time. I realize in hindsight that the bottom step was not very useful for us. Our kids needed it for a very short time - the top step is low enough that they can climb onto it. The only thing I don't like is that it's pretty heavy, and the kids like to push it around between the potty and the sink, but it's a bit hard for them to move."
4,Sturdy stool,"This is a great stool. very sturdy and easy to use even for my 1 1/2 yr old. The only thing I don't like is that the bottom step slides back in easily, it would be nice if it had a lock function for the bottom step. Sometimes my little one has difficulty b/c the bottom step has moved. But compared to plastic stools, this one is great. We have two in our house and would purchase it again."
5,Just what I expected!,The footstool was just what I wanted. It was in great condition and arrived just 2 days after I order it!
4,GREAT FOR THE PRICE,"Great goggles for the price. They stayed clear all day everyday without fogging. The Over The Glasses feature would come in handy if I had glasses and the amber colored lenses were great for various weather conditions. One problem that I did have is that the goggles tend to slide down my face a little and rest on my nose, somewhat restricting my breathing through my nose. It wasn't unbearable though, just an annoyance that I can put up with. Overall I'd recommend them."
3,"Bolle X-9 OTG Goggle, Citrus","use it this winter , good goggles stayed clear everyday without fogging,when I wear this goggle full day have some discomfort on my nose"
5,Perfect for Eyeglass Wearers,"I have used these wonderful Bolle goggles all winter for snowblowing the driveway in winter blizzards (sometimes for hours at a time). They (and my eyeglasses) don't fog up, are very comfortable to wear, fit perfectly as described over my wide rectangular eyeglasses. Wish I had purchased them years ago! They are large enough to protect your eyes and face from icy snow and still look stylish. Good quality lenses and materials. Highly recommend them."
4,"Good product, good value","Product works very well. Would prefer more color options for both frame and lens. Price is also pretty fair, though not great."
4,OK but not perfect for night time,"I needed some OTG goggles for night time skiing and I thought I had found them with the Bolle X-9 OTG Goggles. They are really nice but I still couldn't see too well at night. My son, who snowboards, says they are fine....so they are his now and he uses them all the time. I went and ordered another pair of goggles, this time with clear lenses."
2,Too big for a small to medium woman's face,"These are affordable, and the construction seems good. However, they are way too big for a small to medium woman's face. Basically, with these on, I look completely ridiculous. (Yes, I know ski goggles are supposed to make you look *moderately* ridiculous.) As noted in the name, these are OTG - over the glasses. That's all well and good, but if your spectacles are fairly small in size, these goggles are complete overkill.Again, a perfectly reasonable affordable choice for a person with a large face and/or large specs, but for a small-faced woman with small to medium glasses, they're way too big. I returned mine."
2,Heavy and hard to fit,"I was dissapointed. For the price I expected better glasses. They are a cumbersome fit over my prescription glasses, and they fog up easier than I expected."
5,Looks good,I purchased these for my husband to use in his annual ski trip and this is the first year he is wearing glasses
4,"Too big for me, otherwise a very good product.","This snow goggles is perfect for OTG, GOOD for sunny day only. does not fog at all. If you wear this in cloudy day, the slope may seem all the same to you, the bumps are invisible to you. Do not wear this in cloudy day. The ability of preventing fogging is awesome, I snowboard all day for 8 hours. It does not fog at all. However, the size of this goggle is a little too big for me. I am 5'7'' tall Asian. Only a small part of my nose is exposed, it does not affect my breathing, just do not have a super good looking."
2,too tall for helmet use,Bought these to wear with my Red Trace II helmet and the goggles are too tall above and below the midline of the lens resulting in the helmet pushing the goggles over my nose. I haven't skied with them yet (would return if I could but I accidentally destroyed the box) but I imagine I will be bothered by the goggle pinching my lower nostrils. Ill try them this weekend and if I find the nose issue is unfounded i will consider adding a star. Even with no helmet I feel like a little motion will cause them to slip too low on my nose. No complaints otherwise. They fit over my glasses no problem and don't alter the position on my prescription frames. It seems there is ample room for a large set of prescription frames. Lens reflectiveness matches the picture for the citrus. They come with a carry case/cleaning cloth.
2,Cheap,"The lenses on these are nice, and it's a good feature for them to fit over any prescription glasses. However, these goggles are very cheap and broke within two days of normal usage on the slopes. The plastic buckle broke off. Would never purchase these again."
3,OTC goggles,"Quality goggles,, I would recommend, before purchasing, trying them on with your glasses. These can have a tendency to push your goggles into your forehead."
3,enormous --- and slide down nose,"Although I do not regularly wear glasses, I figured I'd check out the OTGs anyway. They are huge. They had a very large profile and are very wide. They also do not sit on my face well. If I put them up high were they feel comfortable, they fall off. Otherwise they end up sliding down my nose and definitely restrict my breathing.I can't make a recommendation on these since I do not wear glasses underneath, but if you do not wear glasses underneath, I would not wear these."
3,Way too big.,I figured since I'm an overall big guy with a big head those goggles would fit me right unfortunately it would appear those are made for an elephant cuz my face just drowned in them.
4,Dust bag does not work,This is a very nice tool. Accurate. Easy to hold. Good switch position. My complaint is the dust bag. The cloth bag does not open wide enough to let the chips in. P-C needs to improve the dust collection capabilities.
4,One of my favorite power tools.,"I was skeptical about this plate joiner after reading some of the bad reviews about it. I still went ahead a purchased it. Out of my collection of power tools I have found this to be one of my favorites. I am in the process of building kitchen, bathrooms and other cabinets around my house. This has been the perfect tool. It is easy to setup and change to the ""FF"" size biscuits. It is easy to adjust the size and depth. It is perfect for that "" ply. If I had to have any complaints about it would be that the dust bad gets clogged easy and that the small stock guard that slips doesn't fit in the case. Other than that I can not see anything wrong with it. I have had it for about over a year now. I gave this four stars because nothing is perfect.Porter-Cable 5553 No. 20 Biscuits (1,000-Pack)"
1,Parts Don't Fit,Don't buy this plate joiner!! A small but important part holding the fence in place broke (problem #1) and I went to Porter Cable to get a replacement part. Got one from a parts dealer (costing nearly $20 for a little plastic part) but it would not fit - the two screw holes were spaced too far apart and the part would not seat in the recesses in the metal flange where it needs to be firmly attached (problem #2). Got a second part from the authorized Porter Cable dealer with exactly the same problem. How can a manufacturer make a product and then provide replacement parts - replacement parts essential to the tool's operation - that will not fit??!! The tool is useless because Porter Cable can't do the easy job of making replacement parts that are like the parts on the original product!! BUY SOMETHING ELSE!!!!!!
4,"Great tool, except for the dust collection.","This is the first plate joiner I have ever owned. I'm getting lazy, and no longer feel like cutting stopped dadoes for splines when edge gluing boards. So what to do? Buy a plate joiner! After all the positive reviews on Amazon, and the recommendations from a few people, figured the Porter Cable is the one to buy. Overall, this is a solid tool. The fence is long, and sturdy, the plunge mechanism has close tolerances so there isn't any ""wiggle"" (that is a highly technical term), and the micro adjust is great. If only using the dust collection bag, good luck! The tube leading into the bag clogs up, and the wood chips wind up everywhere except in the bag after cutting a few slots. Hook it up to your shop vacuum or, for you high end folk, your dust collection system, and there will be no problems."
2,Not very accurate,"I had one of these. It is good enough for case work like kitchen cabinets but not accurate enough for joining stiles and rails or furniture work. The blade alignment of mine was tilted about 1/64"" from one side to the other."
5,It's easy & accurate,"The Porter Cable biscuit cutter was in use within 10 minutes of opening the box. The adjustments are intuitive, easy to make and accurate. After a few practice cuts this tool was off and running on the real thing. No I'm not a pro, just a hobbyist. This tool simply does the job it was purchased for nicely."
4,Excellent Tool,"This was my first of many tool purchases .... I read several reviews in different magazines and consulted with a few buddies that are wood working hobbiests. I came down to the Porter-Cable and a Makita. I went and looked at both models, there's no comparison. The PC has a better and easier elevation adjustment and it's easier to handle. I've built a captain's bed and two dressers with it. Accurate cuts every time."
4,Nice tool,First time ever used biscuit joiner. Works great. Very easy to use. Only thing wrong was that dust bag clogged too often.
2,plastic,"I looked at this plate jointer, and did not buy it. The angle fence rotates on a joint made of plastic. I don't use my tools much, but I keep them for a long time. Based on past experience, I will not buy a tool where a primary hinge is made of plastic."
5,re: makinsawdust review,"I have actually used the DeWalt quite a few times with NO problems described below. ALL of my panels glued-up dead-on...perfect. Frankly, the machine is so sturdy that I think it would be virtually impossible to get it to carve out inaccurate slots in any two pieces of wood.Realistically, even if the DeWalt (or ANY biscuit joiner!) was ""off"" by 1/32"" or so, it's a moot point. It's a standard practice to sand the panels after joining them together anyway, just in case you accidentally skewed the panels during glue-up. Once the glue is applied to both edges, those edges become VERY slippery and by simply clamping them, you could cause them to skew slightly. Therefore, you ALWAYS sand the final panels in their entirety to ensure that everything is flush. You would never notice if you sanded 1/32"" to get the panels ""flat"" or flush."
3,"Adequate performance, price is a little much","This unit is plagued by the infamous ""co-planer"" problem requireing a shim to ""correct"". It has not been much of an issue for me. The performance of this unit is not up to PC standards.Cuts are hard and burn often. Blade was cleaned and sharpened with no improvement.I still get reasonable results, but i'm sure a lower priced model would deliver the same quality."
2,Didn't hold up to Porter Cable Repuation,"I've had a Porter Cable router for years, it's a real workhorse and I love it. So when I was ready to buy a buscuit jointer, Porter Cable's reputation, as well as the FF buscuit capacity made it a clear choice.As another reviewer pointed out the pivots for the fence are made of plastic, and do not hold up at all. I've had my jointer for 6 months, used it to make 1 face frame, and put it away. I went to use it again today and the right pivot gave out - completely worthless. I'll have to wait and see if they'll send me the replacement part, or if they'll make me ship the whole thing to them (on my dime of course).It's a great tool when it works, but if it can't get through 2 jobs without breaking, it's a pretty expensive mistake."
1,Choose Lamello,I had the old style porter cable plate jointer and a friend of mine bought a new 557 and I was going to buy a 557 until I used his. The problems with the 557 is the open fence area makes it difficult to bisquit narrow with pieces. I had to use a plywood scrap under the fence to use on narrow pieces.My friends 557 has end play on the on the blade and this makes for sloppy bisquit slots. My friend also said that he has a difficult time keeping the slots all the same height from the top of the fence down to the slot. Over all I was not impressed. I sent and e-mail to Porter Cable but they didn't respond. I bought a Lamello Classic 2. I love it.
3,Was Very Impressed,"I was quite impressed with this tool at first. I have used the earlier version of this model as well as the Dewalt. This unit seemed quite well built and accurate. I have owned it for 8 months or so, but it hasn't gotten all that much use. I have probably used it between 1 and 2 dozen times with great results, until today.As another reviewer noted, the fence pivot pieces are made of plastic, and one deformed so badly that the fence isn't able to be pivoted using the lower set of angles. I am terrible disappointed in this part of the tool. So, its still under warranty, but I have to pay to ship it to be fixed. Sounds pretty shady to me. PC might have lost a customer if they don't take care of this properly.Also, as many have noted, the dust collection is mostly just for show without a shop vac."
4,Porter-Cable 557XXX Professional Plate Joiner Kit,"Bought this from Amazon a couple years ago. They had a rebate and credit card deal going on. This one replaced my Ryobi that I had for a few years. No comparison. But at twice the price, I guess there shouldn't be. The saw is all set to go right out of the box. The barrel grip is comfortable, cuts are crisp and clean and the motor is very powerful. Would have given this tool a 5-star if it had a better dust collection. Overall, an excellent joiner. If you need the face frame capabilities, this is the joiner to buy. Highly recommended."
3,Blade holder needs redesign,"The second day I owned the Porter-Cable Plate Joiner, the blade change screw became stuck. I tried WD40 and an extension on the Allen wrench that came with the joiner. The Allen wrence broke. I took the joiner to the local warranty repair facility. They were also unable to remove the blade. In fact, they damaged the retaining screw and the blade while trying to fix it. I had to leave the joiner with them for a week for repair. So I did not have use of the tool during the first week I owned it. On the good side, the repair was free and joiner does a good job."
5,Porter-Cable 557 7 Amp Plate Joiner Kit,"I love it! Product arrived one day before scheduled time (thank you Amazon) in perfect condition, no missing details or cracked parts. Also it has a nice-looking durable case, additional 2-inch blade, 5/32 Allen wrench for blade change, alignment plate for narrow stock and of-course dust bag. After unpacking, short adjustment and setup I plugged it... It made a perfect (#20) slot in which biscuit matches perfectly. Amazing... I recommend this device to all woodworkers on earth..."
1,Doesn't hold up.,Plastic pieces that guide the table break over time. Replacing them seems imposable now that Dewalt owns Porter-Cable now. Buy something else.
5,Plate joiner,"This is a high qualit tool. Once you get the hang of it, it will be very easy to adjust. It is extremly accurate!"
3,PC557 Biscuit Joiner Over-rated,After all the hype written about this joiner I was less than impressed. The FF biscuits require a blade change and the blade is difficult to replace. I skin my knuckles every time. Dust/chips are directed towards your eyes too. I always wear eye protection when using this joiner.
1,Junk,"I've had this plate jointer for a couple of months now, and I use it fairly often, but certainly not everyday but when I need it to work I need it to work. I have found one major weakness of this model when compaired to other brands: The pivots for the fence are plastic. Today during use the pivots bound up, and the little plastic pivots shredded, the upshot was game over until I can find replacement parts. Not what I'd expect of a ""professional"" grade tool that I rely on to keep on working so that I can keep earning the $$$, especially since I spent more to get this one. Shame on porter cable for such a weak design. Either spend less for the dewalt or more for a lamello, I wish I had."
5,AMAZING,i got this light bulb at petsmart 2009 ago and it was also the first time i got my python. This light bulb is still going strong and also the best one i had yet GOOD JOB !
1,Guarateed to Leak!!!,"I've gone through two of these, and both have failed. I 100% agree with both other reviewers. Terrible product. I've had the original repaired, then replaced. Wasted money hiring a plumber and buying replacement parts as well as a whole new faucet thinking the first one was a lemon. Please do not waste your money. It WILL leak within a year, guaranteed!"
1,a leaky mess,"I recommend this faucet to anyone who likes the way it looks,as I do, and does not need to use it. As long as you do not turn on the water, it does not leak. If you need to use this as a faucet, I do not recommend it. I leaks horribly and when I tried to get Kohler to make good on the warranty it would only send weird looking parts with no instructions. The plumber said it would cost three times the price of a new faucet to try to fix it and he said he did not think it would really stop leaking. I finally bought another faucet--but not a Kohler!!"
1,Disappointing,My wife loved the look of this faucet. We had it installed in our house five years ago when we were building our home. For the last two years the handle has been sticking. A plumber took it apart and found it had a broken part. Since we didn't have the receipt we are out of luck. We are just going to buy a new ( different) faucet. Has anyone else had this problem? We can barely even move the handle. Very aggravating !
4,McCracken and Wareagle enter the Hellfire once again!,"The Earth is in peril of destruction, and it's up to Blaine,Wareagle and a beautiful Russian assassin to thwart the forces responsible. The people of a small Colorado town must endure the visciousness of a sadistic Nicaraguan major. The town is small but plays a big role to save Earth!"
4,Solid performance,"I have come to really enjoy Jon Land's books. They are very entertaining. Not as cerebral as I would like, but again they are action novels. Really not intended to challenge your intellect but to simply entertain. In this genre Mr. Land is very adept."
5,Great Doll!,"I got this doll a while ago and it is wondful! Don't listen to the people who say she is so gross and ugly! And that 'Jadey' person, I wouldn't listen to someone who pulls heads off dolls! And yes she is durable because barbie's heads aren't meant to be yanked off! She is one of my favorite dolls and I would reccomend to anyone!(unless they pull heads off dolls)"
4,Listen!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Overall I'm angry that people said that this toy is ""Not fun to play with!""This toy is very durable,and pretty.People saying they're not durable is because they keep yanking heads and arms off!!!!Sometimes,Barbie dolls aren't just changing clothes,and combing hair!And besides,if you press the button on her back,the wings flap!!!Sometimes,you can make stories with different kinds of Barbies!Like what I did to my Barbies!Unlike others,I highly recomend this toy,it is NOT A WASTE OF MONEY!!!"
1,MOST STUPID,THIS IS THE MOST STUPID TOY I HAVE EVER SEEN.HER ARMS FELL OFF THE SAME DAY THAT I BOUGHT IT.
1,Don't use with Genesis or Sega CD!,"I bought 2 of these 1 for a Sega Genesis(gen 1) system and 1 for the Sega CD(gen 1) that attaches to it. The adapter puts out 850 mA of current and these 2 systems require 1200 mA each. The systems will have enough power to turn on, but have major visual and operational problems. These problems were fixed by using a Sega brand adapter. My advice is to buy the Sega brand adapter or at least one that puts out 9V DC 1200 mA(1.2 A) as listed on the bottom of each system."
3,"NES=okay, SNES=wavy",so i bought this because i had an extra snes and nes that i sold on Ebay with the regular AC adapters and this seemed like just what i needed for the snes and nes i was keeping. it works just fine with my nes but i dont think its delivering the right amount of juice for a snes because my tv picture was all wavy and not clear. my snes was never wavy with my nintendo brand ac adapter. didnt have a genesis model 1 to test it on so im not sure about it. maybe i just got a bad adapter out of the bunch but from now on im sticking to Nintendo brand adapters.
3,A little too small and velcro wears off,"I ordered this product over a year ago while I was in Iraq and running a lot. It was a little too small for my arm and had some tendency to slide down my arm, and the velcro had a tendency to come loose - especially with sweat. Making adjustments occassionally while running was a little bit of a pain, but definitely better than holding the iPod shuffle in my hand."
1,not the right fit,"my arm wasn't big enough for the band, needs to have a larger velcro band. had to purchase a different band."
3,Small people only apply,It does the job but I purchased it for my husband and if he flexes it pulls off because his biceps are too big... I would suggest this for smaller women.
1,"Weak, Low Budget - Don't Bother","We've used a dozen instructional videos as we've been learning ballrom dancing, and this one is by far the worst. It is low budget with very little detail and lots of confusion. The Nancy Hays dance videos are still the best."
5,Messages Beyond the Pages,"Messages from Jesus, A Dialogue of Love is truly inspiring. Although the chapters are based on Jesus' answers to questions in regards to Love, Nature, War, Healing and more, the messages resonant beyond the written words on the pages. So much love abounds from this book that the messages are easily taken to heart. It should be read by every man, woman and child."
5,A Rare and Special Life-Changing Book,"MESSAGES FROM JESUS by Saint Ta is a beautiful book you won't want to put down. Saint Ta poses questions to Jesus with the naturalness and innocence of a child. And the energy, wisdom and love that come through from Jesus are deeply touching, profound and unforgettable.Those fortunate enough to come across and read this book are receiving a rare gift.Karen Wylie"
5,I love this book!,A classic... they don't make them like this anymore.I read it every day in the 1st grade and recently purchased it again. It brings back all the fun of being a little kid who liked to play ghosts and haunted house!
2,"Eh,I wouldn't spend 11.99 on it","I have mixed feelings on ""Never Too Far"".Well,the great thing about this song is the lyrics.It is definatlly the typical Mariah Carey balad.However,Mariah does not sound good in this song.In the songs chours its like she is screaming in your ears.I also don't like how the song sounds.It sounds like every other Mariah balad.I can't stand the song ""Don't Stop""!!I can't even understand a word of what either her or Mystical are saying.The beats to it are horrible and it is an utterly rediculous song.My grade:Never Too Far/C+Don't Stop/F"
4,Never Too Far,"Personally,i like the song,Never Too Far.I was blown away when i first listened this song.It is a great ballad from Mariah.It is definitely better than some of her previous ballads,such as When You Believe,I Still Believe.You can feel the pain and heartache when you listen to this song.And not too forget,her amazing angelic voice that is shown at the end of the song.Dont Stop is an upbeat hip-hop song.I find it catchy and it is a new style of music from Mariah.I think it is far better than some of her hip-hop work in Rainbow.The reason i give this CD-single 4 stars is i dont really like Loverboy."
2,"""Foghorn Leghorn, Tweety Bird & Friends Vol. 3""","I've watched ""Crowing Pains"" and ""A Tale of Two Kitties"" (both from the '40s). They're on ""Cartoon Crazys 1"" and the MGM/UA tape, ""Tweety and Sylvester""."
5,Going back for more!,"This is a nice bag. Good size, larger than the bags I have bought from grocery stores and such. Feels like it could withstand washing unlike the store bought bags. Gave these as gifts, but I am going back for more."
3,"Good, but not great","I do like these bags. They work well, and four of them are just about perfect for grocery shopping for a family of four. The long handle is great, and the construction is good quality. My only complaints are; 1., the price. They're pretty expensive for a bag. I found after I purchased them that they're more reasonably priced on the manufacturers website, and they often have shipping deals. My other complaint is major. The first time I washed the bags, they shrunk to about half the size, and I did NOT put them in the dryer. I liked them much better before I washed them. That said, they do the job and I like that they're fair wage. From now on, I'll buy them direct from the manufacturer and not wash them until I absolutely have to."
1,False advertising,"The description indicates a 22"" over-the-should strap. That is not the case. Only a 6 or 7"" strap is the case so that it has to be hand held. Very disappointed, but not worth returning."
1,Very Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with the purchase of this product for the following reasons. The dimensions that are given are for the bag prior to being washed. In other words, the canvas was not preshrunk before the bag was assembled. The bag shrunk in size by over an inch in width and height. I have several other canvas bags, so I know how to care for canvas bags. They are to be washed in cold water and hung to dry. The canvas material used in making these bags was very thin and inferior. I would not recommend these bags, as I believe it is not a quality product."
1,Shrinks even when laundering instructions are followed,"I like canvas bags. I have lots of them and use them to carry groceries, books, hardware, clothes, etc. I've washed lots of canvas bags and never had one shrink. This Ecobags canvas bag shrank even when washed in cold water. Ecobags should have use preshrunk canvas.Additionally, the straps are not 22"". Mine are 9"" from the top edge of the bag to the middle of the handle which makes it more suitable for hand carrying."
3,Okey product,"It makes the water stains on my granite counter top lighter and less visibal, but does not make them gone after repeated applications. It has no effect on oil stains at all no matter how long and how many times I have tried."
4,Nice fan memento geared towards kids,"This is a short book that is written for children by Gaby. It is a nice, brief telling of her life story, and how she became a tennis player. Some family photos included. It is inexpensive, under $9.00, and a nice addition for a Gaby Fan. It is also a good little book for children, as she writes positively about her family and friends and lessons from tennis. Positive story about an athlete. Has some written exercises in the back for kids to try out about life, family, friends, and goals. Again, it's a book for children, but a fan of Gabriela will also enjoy it for the photos and to read her story."
2,Hardly world class for the price,"Cannot recommend this cabinet; though it is advertised as 'built to last a lifetime' it could not even hold up to standard shipping. It arrived broken already, before it was even used once or displayed. A closer inspection revealed shoddy worksmanship and equally sub par materials. Way over priced for what you get, and the cabinet would obviously not be able to stand up to use if you opened and closed it daily."
2,Savage Land,"I always enjoy her books. However, this book has so many errors it's hard to believe anyone reviewed it before it was published."
4,not as good as banana republic...or is it?,"I bought almost an exact replica last fall from Banana Republic. Liked the style so I decided to buy a cheaper version from urban outfitters. They both amazingly have the same texture almost, just a little different of a design. And most girls appreciate this sweater. So you have to have one."
3,A look into depravity,"This book illustrates just how far some people can sink in order to fulfill their own selfish desires. It's good to see that the justice system works.The writing in this book was not the best in that it was too redundant. That said, it was a quick read."
3,Special Book,"This book is very interesting but especially sad and very gory The writer does an excellant job with details and making sure all the information is infront on you, However he back tracks throughout the book constantly making you think did I already read this part?? However the story is good reading material if you like this sort of thing, However the book is difficult to follow due to the writer"
4,Reference Handbook,"This is exactly that, a REFERENCE HANDBOOK. It is not meant to be a study guide or anything similar to that. It is just the same book that you will be given when you take the FE exam. The purpose of buying this book is so that you can get familiar with it and use it as your reference handbook when you are studying for the FE exam, that way when you take the actual exam you will feel more comfortable with the reference material given to you and you will be able to find things quicker."
3,Just a Reference,"The NCEES Fundamentals of Engineering: FE Reference Handbook is just that, a general reference. Although it did give me a good idea of what to expect on the exam, it did not prepare me as well as some of the other manuals could have that my friends were using. If you feel you have a stong understanding of all engineering fundamentals and would just like to brush up on a few skills, this handbook will help you decide which areas you would like to review more in depth, but you will need to use another resource for the reviewing."
5,2 4 1,"I had each of these as a single disc, but lost my collection and have to begin again.To get these to albums together on one disc is a life saver. Thank you Amazon.com.Some may tink 'Groove People' is smaltzy, but I love the feel of it.And to be able to hear Someday You'll Be Old' and 'This Song Will Last Forever'My goodness, it's unmistakably Lou."
2,Smells Like Tobacco Smoke,"We bought this vacuum for dirty jobs, and for that purpose it should do ok. It performs better than the old Eureka it replaces. However, the unit was dirty out of the box, the frame is dinged up, and the unit stinks of tobacco smoke."
1,Not a wonderful vacuum,"I don't know how this vaccum works new but this reconditioned one that I bought from Amazon is useless. The vaccum works ok but the hose will not pick up a thing. It is loud and whines. I will not buy another ""Remanufactured"" anything again. Very disappointed."
2,works well....for a while,"I bought this because I had read some pretty good reviews and because the price was right. It worked really well for a couple of months and then just quit picking up. We returned it but got an identical model, hoping that one had been an anomaly. Four months later, here we are again - it just quit having any suction. sigh."
5,This vaccum rocks!,"I was leery at first of the low rate and it being refurbished. But, the vacuum is like new! Who could ask for more?"
1,"Ditto - clog, clog.","Seriously, just spend a little extra, do some research, and get a better vacuum. Mine clogged up, so I bought another, and the 2nd one clogged up too - and I don't have pet hair problems or overly used or dirty carpets. If you could clear the clog on your own, I wouldn't be complaining. After all, I know how to use a screwdriver. But the problem is, the places where it gets clogged, you can't access without destroying the hose. I change the bag regularly, so its not like its operator error or something. It gets clogged to the point that no dust, debris, or anything will ever reach the bag. This vacuum, for all intents and purposes, is disposable. Might be good for a dorm room where you can just throw it out after the semester is over because you don't want to move it. But if you're a real person who wants a vacuum to last for more than 4-5 uses, run away from this vacuum. Thanks!"
1,Doesn't Bother With Context,"The author like so many others lumped all Christian denominations and seeminingly monotheistic religions together as one. No, not all Christians are the same. Furthermore, the author took many verses in the Bible out of context, rather than choosing to see it as a whole, he instead sees it in pieces, as being contradictory, not bothering to take seriously WHY the Bible made certain statements."
2,Basic protection,"Basic virus protection which is hard, at best, to get updates. Virus protection is better the more you spend. I had 3 virus' down my system with this product on it.Don't waste your time here...."
3,This cd offers a good selection of standards,"First I would like to thank Mr. Short for the great songs that he performs on this cd. I have never heard some of these songs sound so good.For this cd Bobby recorded most of the tunes instrumentaly and threw in a couple vocals for good measure, which is fine with me.Bobby and his band did a wonderful job of reviving these old work horses. These songs were really played well.I would like to see Bobby record some more cds along this line. I would be the first in line to buy them.Recommendation: If you like smooth jazz this cd is for you."
5,highly recommended,"This instructional video learns how to use your D50. It shows you what aperture, shutter speed etc. mean AND DO. You can see it on your screen and that's a BIG advantage over a book that is way too static to explain and show the settings. You will learn so much more from this video than from any book about the D50."
5,"Great Quality, Accurate","Great quality map, made of tear resistant and somewhat water proof paper. I found this map extremely useful when I visited Death Valley."
3,UNDERWHELMED,"I saw these on food networks ""Unwrapped"" and couldn't wait to try them, I actually and thankfully signed up for an Amazon CC and got a 30.00 credit. So I didnt actually ""pay"" for these. Anyway, I was expecting the ""snap"" as advertised and shown on T.V. The only ""snap"" was actually a ""crunch"" of a LITTLE candy in the cookie. I was very disappointed. The flavors were okay. A very mild flavor not as I expected. A typical shortbread, not a lot of crunchy candy and over half of the cookies were broken in the package!! And about the packaging. I understood all the cookies to be in a cool paint can, apparently when you buy the sampler package they just come in a foil bag inside a cardboard box. If you only eat a few cookies the rest get stale VERY quickly. Well, One bite of each cookie was enough for me, Now I have 30.00 worth of cookies sitting in my cupboard. UNDERWHELMED and DISSAPPOINTED. Guess you shouldn't believe what you see on T.V. IMO"
5,Yummy!!!!,"At first I was reluctant to try these cookies but, now that I have, I can't get enough of them. A sales rep dropped them off at our office and then I was on the search to find them. Thank goodness for Amazon. The key-lime are my favorite. They have a nice light taste of lime and they are nice and cruchy. Perfect combination of flavor and texture."
5,insightful and fresh,kim carson is an undiscovered genius of american country music.her lyrics are insightful and fresh. her music reflects on her uniqueway of engaging life that is genuine and up tempo. the only thingthat is better than her recordings is to hear her live.
4,Great for small jobs around my yard,This was a great item it did all I could ask for for the price. I did add some weight to it as the dirt I was moving was full of clay. I would recommend this to anyone who needs to move gravel or topsoil. It took several passes to tear up existing grass and dirt. Overall it worked great and I no problems assembling or using it.
5,Great pillow!!!,We got this for my daughter for her 3rd Christmas. And she's now five years old and still uses it. It still looks great and works great! Love that it is a stuffed animal and pillow in one!
4,Never Used - Not Product Fault,"Purchased these clips to hang Christmas lights on the outside of my house without damaging the brick. I never used this product after I purchased it because the grout on my brick wall is flush with the edge of the brick. There has to be a setback in the mortar for the clips to work properly. Check your brick to see if there is room for this clip before ordering.The clip looked to be good quality and design, just did not work for my situation"
5,Good Quality But I Don't Know About EHD,"Really nice ratchet straps. The ratcheting mechanism is comfortable on the hands and easy to use. It's a thin strap and I would be leery using them for anything uh Extremely Heavy Duty, but will work perfectly for securing my Thule car top carrier, which is all I want them for. Finding a decent six foot ratchet strap is not easy, and these definitely fit the bill, especially for the price. I'm using them for an upcoming road trip, so I'll update if there are any problems, but I really don't foresee any. Five stars for my purposes.Edit 5-17-12: Straps worked great holding my car top carrier down on a 2500 mile road trip. Absolutely no complaints."
1,Far from Heavy Duty,"I was quite disappointed with these tie-downs. Described as ""extreme heavy duty"", these might be suitable for attaching a bicycle to a vehicle but they are too light and thin for use as motorcycle or ATV tie-downs. Now it's off to the UPS store to send these back to Amazon."
1,Item not as described,Description states straps are 2 inches wide. Just recieved these and they are only 1 inch wide. Haven't determined yet whether to return or keep them.
3,Follow the River,Great fiction novel based on hystorical fact. The ending was not accurate and was too dramatic. Indian would never have returned the child.
4,Good family movie,"Enjoyable. Especially touching for southwest Virginia area, since it was based on historical event there. Hungry Mother Park named for this heroine."
3,Attention ROC fans,Not a bad flick if you want to see Renee O'Connor in one of her earlier roles. Unfortunately she is not in the movie very long. Worthwile anyway. Entertaining made-for-TV movie.
1,Follow the River DVD,"Big disappointment if you've read the book... and I HIGHLY recommend the book! The book is on my top ten list, so go to the library or buy the book. Don't bother with the movie."
1,Not worth the purchase,"I am a huge fan of the book. I've read it so many times that some pages are taped back into the book.The 'Made for TV' film just didn't live up to my expectations. I never would have picked this cast, I wasn't impressed on how cut up and the acting was so-so.I found this film a huge dissappointment."
3,Must read Novel,"Movie does not come close to the novel. I was disappointed. I would like to see a re-make; an R-rating would be more appropriate to the true story. The novel was amazing, I couldn't put it down. The highlights were the birth of the child; the gauntlet took tremendous courage, leaving the baby was heart-breaking, but the most imaginable hardship was the journey back home. The movie gives no insight to the true suffering and sacrifice this woman made to get back to her husband. A must Read!"
2,Follow the River,Not a great movie...but okay. The actors are not very interesting...the acting is so-so. I would not recommend this movie for those who seek a lot of action. It's more like a Disney type film.
3,FOLLOW THE RIVER,"This is a great survival flick - and it really happened! Sheryl Lee is excellent as the proud, tenatious pregnant survivor of an Indian raid. Eric Schweig provides more than enough screen chemistry as her also proud, interested Indian suitor. If you liked Last of the Mohecans, see this true story."
3,Not Like The Book,This was a romanticized version of the book. Wish it had stayed true to the true story.
2,"Eric Schweig, The Only Reason To Watch This!","This was a horrible movie! If you believe what you see on Dr.Quinn, you'll love it. If you know better however, you will be very disappointed, as I was. Sheryl Lee overacted her way all through this film. I pity Eric Schweig having to share the screen with her. However, Schweig remains the only true reason to bare out this film. While his acting talents were hardly tapped by this ""The Olson Twins Survive an Indian Raid"" type script, he was the most believable character. This story, like Schweig, has so much potential in a film medium. Too bad Hallmark did this with it instead."
2,bland at best,"A Hallmark Hall of Fame production, this made for TV movie has about as much true emotion as a typical Hallmark card.The Indians are not frightening. The women, after being prisoners on the trail for days, look like they had just stepped from the shower in fresh clothes. They mostly happily smile at each other, except during the requisite Emotional Outbursts and Tellings Off. The escape lacks even a modicum of tension. The whole film drips Sincerity.Eric Schweig, a good actor, is wasted.The best that this film has going for it is that it is inoffensive. Just like a Hallmark card.Maybe the book will be better."
1,"Worst Vacuum I have ever had.....if I could have put less than a zero, I would have","This is the worst vacuum I have ever had. It never worked from day one. It didn't pick up very well at all. It smelled terrible during vacuuming, and afterwards. It left the whole house with a terrible smell. When I emptied it, it got dust everywhere.It was a big piece of junk. I wouldn't take one if someone was giving one away."
2,It did not make it a year!,"I liked it, it was easy to use & did the job....until after about 9 months of ownership (and LIGHT use) it started making a very loud noise and smelling funny. I took it apart & cleaned everything out but it did not help, the noise is coming from the motor. I won't use it in that condition, I am afraid it is going to blow up."
2,R.I.P. Bissell June 2005 - April 2006,"This vacuum worked well at first and it was great not to have to deal with bags. A few months ago the vacuum started smelling awful and got increasingly loud. We cleaned out the filter and the rolling brush which was a pain. Soon after, the belt broke and the rolling brush melted into the part that was holding it in place. It still has suction, but it doesn't help unless I'm only using the attachments. I called a service center and the parts would have to be ordered and costed more than what we paid for the vacuum. Needless to say, we're now buying a new one. It had a good run, almost lasted a year, but I did expect more from a Bissell."
3,Good for the money,"I'm pleased with the way it works. It picks up well and is easy to maintain. However, the main filter was scented. You have to wash the filter anyway instead of replacing it (very easy, very fast drying) and once I did that a couple of times the smell was gone. It is like an air-freshener, but I just don't like those scents."
2,not completely satisfied,"I used the vacuum 3 times when a piece broke. I called Bissel and they said to take it to be fixed, because it was warranted for 90 days. I said I had no papers, they said no problem. I took it to be fixed and it would have cost me almost as much as the vacuum, so I didn't get it fixed. Not Happy"
1,Piece of junk,I bought one of this junk from Walmart with higher price and the belt driving the little brushes for carpet cleaning broke after 3~4 times using.The sealing of the dust collecting compartment is another problem. You can visually observe some dirts were blowed out back into the air while you vacuum.Highly not recommended.
2,Academic and dry,"Dyer's book consists of a series of essays on topics ranging from why villages declined in England in the middle ages to changes in diet to gardens, peasant buildings and the peasant's revolt of 1381. Yet unlike the tremendous breadth and depth of Paul B. Newman's far more engagingly written ""Daily Life in the Middle Ages,"" Dyer's book seems to be as much about justification for why Dyer's view of life in the middle ages is accurate as about actual medieval life. This book is written more for the academic who cares deeply about sources for what is known than what is known itself, and the dry style and format (intro, argument, conclusion, and lots of footnotes, charts and tables) won't win many fans outside academia."
4,Read in bites.,"As the other reviewer stated, ELiME is typical Dyer, thoroughly sourced and thought provoking. Dry enough however to be read in portions over several weeks with your favorite libation.As to the other reviewer who commented ""...marketed to a general audience..."" uh..what?I think no one here is under the illusion any of Dyer's books will be recommended by Oprah's book club.As for dismissing sourcing, you do a disservice to those who labour over such time intensive minutiae. I'd rather have period sources that you can see, than contemporary supposition on 'facts' alluded to or gleaned."
2,Not too useful,"The phrases are rarely used except the most common which can be looked up. I constantly find words not listed in the dictionary, especially the things on restaurant menus. Its not completely useless but a bare to carry for its limited use. I would search elsewhere for a more useful book. If there aren't any, I guess this will do."
1,Not a way to learn the language,"It seems that Americans buy books such as these in great numbers. They are generally a waste of time. If one observes how most foreigners speak English when they visit us, we might try to emulate them when we go abroad. Italian is not a particularly difficult language to learn; there are many cognates with English....and Spanish and French. You will enjoy foreign travel so much more if your vocabulary can be extended beyond ""Where is the Post Office"". In fact, with laptops and e-mail, no one really uses the post office very much these days. Get some tapes and listen to them on your commute; take an adult ed. course, but these phrase books, which looked cute 50 years ago when post-war Americans started discovering Europe should now be considered obsolete."
1,unsatisfactory,"I received this after my trip and was told I would be receiving a return authorization, but I have not received it."
1,Mostly useless,I found the book very difficult to use and almost never had what I was looking for. The small dictionary in the back of my eyewitness travel guide was much more useful.
5,Perfect...it's all you'll need,"I love the Rick Steves Travel books so I bought this and the German language book to try out. I'm very impressed and highly recommend them. They're small and thin so they fit in your back pocket. The books contain just what you need - nothing more, nothing less.Easy to navigate and find the scenario you're in so you can respond or ask the right question quickly.So many other language book writers could learn a great deal from Rick's books.FYI for language book writers:- read Rick's books and imitate them;- we're on vacation - make the book small! That's right, not text book size!- and, we're not trying to learn to speak the language - we just want to avoid ordering bacon bits on our favorite gelatto. Keep it simple!Make sense?"
5,Great Travel Companion,"Very helpful, well-organized. Saw lots of people in Rome using the same book. Full of humor. Unfortunately mine was stolen in Rome before I finished the trip. I really missed it."
4,One GREAT resource- skip packing the others!,"We went to Italy know no Italian. I had been to Italy 10 years earlier and struggled with the language and the books that I had then were useless. I had tried to listen to some CDs prior to our trip but didn't gain much useful information at all. However, this little book by Rick Steves' was with us everywhere we went! It was extremely helpful when we were in small villages where no one spoke any English. I was amazed at how picking up a few words here and there with this book we could order what we wanted, find directions and get around. Rick also gives some light-hearted comments within the book that made communicating with these wonderful people even fun! My husband, not usually into travel books - would double check to see if we had ""the talking book"" with us... I recommend this book!"
4,You probably don't need this book,Having traveled in Italy extensively I find that an Italian/English dictionary is more useful than this combination. And smaller. Many Italians speak more English than you can speak Italian. I've used Rick Steves Guide books for years. They are great. Save your money. Don't buy this but buy an up to date guide from Rick.
3,This book's title should be changed,"While this book will probably come in handy for my upcoming trip to Italy, I am disappointed in the contents. While the title is ""phrase book"", the book is almost entirely just a list of individual words and how they are pronounced.This book would be much more helpful to me if it included more actual phrases that one might use while traveling, rther than just individual words. This is really not a ""phrase"" book."
5,Simple/quick study guide,There's just the basics for quick referencing that you'll need when traveling and there's more elaborate instructions for use once you get a handle on the language. Easty to use and extremely helpful guidebook
5,Prego...,"Now if you read this book, you'd know what that means (Can I help you. Do you speak Italian? Here it is). It's not a high school langauge class, but it's a lot more fun, and with some time you'll get pretty good.I think Rick does a great job is laying out the phrases that you'll need if you go to Italy. We're going in a few weeks, and it's really helping. Now if he could only improve the memory.The book is small, will fit in a shirt pocket. It's broken down into sections (basics, eating, chating, etc.) so you can focus in on a section that you need, master it, then move to another section. After you've been through it all, you can then start combining different phrases and make some great sentences. It's got a lot of mnaterial in it, so start early when you decide to use it.Thanks Rick, I actually feel that I can go into the Italian world and be somewhat understood. And, not to worry, I'll smile as I butcher the language, use my hands a lot, and laugh at the whole thing."
4,Nice Basic Start,"This is a nice way to start to learn ""By the Phrase"" Italian. Having just been to Italy, I can vouch for the generally friendly and helpful nature of most of the residents. Also, in most of the more popular tourist destinations, English is often spoken. So, if you were to work with this book and learn some of the useful, ordinary phrases, it would probably make a nice impression on the native Italians and would make you feel less like a clueless tourist. This book will not make you really fluent, nor will it teach you the real mechanics of the language. Keep in mind this a phrase based, quick start approach that is easy to read and should help the average tourist."
4,Great take-along phrase book!,"Contains the words and phrases you will actually use on a trip. Organized for easy, quick reference. Highly recommend Rick Steve's guidebooks as well. Have used them with great success in the past!"
2,It is rude in places,"In laundry "" It smells like a locker room is not really useful"". Under paying for your meal...""What if I wash the dishes""?The Italians will think you have lost your mind!!!One does not say ""I am full"" at the end of an Italian meal.This book must have been written for a kid on his first back packing trip to Italy.These stupid remarks take up too much space and much more useful phrases could have been included."
4,Great Help,"The book is small, but help - tremendous. With section on basic Italian skills the doors are open to any simple conversation. I liked chapter on eating and dining. English menus are posted everywhere but I like to understand a little of Italian as well."
3,Not pratical for me,"For me this book is not practical. When in Italy I would like to be able to look up Italian words in a dictionary to find out the basic meaning. The book is full of phrases that I wouldn't know how to pronounce, since I don't know Italian, and if someone was to respond, I wouldn't know what they said anyway. If anyone knows of a small carry along book that would be convenient to translate basic menu items and basic Italian to English and English to Italian, please list it. I know I should learn some of the local language when traveling, but haven't been able to remember or master them when I tried."
5,This will help me tremendously,"I am hoping to go to Italy later this year. This book is a MUST if you cannot speak Italian. It is easy to phonetically speak the words and phrases. It is categorized according to specific topics such as traveling, money, how to check into a hotel etc."
4,Rick Steves Italian Phrasebook and Dictionary,"It is a convenient, compact book that is easy to use. It is organized in a way that enables you to locate the words or phrases that you need by various catgegories."
4,The basics and then some,this book was very easy to use and gave me the basic information I needed to know to communicate the essentials. it also has more details that can help you converse (lightly) with others. very helpful when I remembered what I read (lol).
1,I have to agree with the majority here...,"I just have to agree with the majority of the reviews here: One of the worst movies I have watched. I thought that all of the other films I have seen that were based on Arriaga's screenplays--Amores Perros, 21 Grams, Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, Babel, The Burning Plain--were very good, some excellent, and all genuinely thought provoking, so I was really looking forward to this one. No such luck. As others observed, there was too much sex and it was pointless. The story was threadbare--whether Arriaga's own screenplay or the inadequate realization by the director is to blame, I have no idea--but, what was most maddening, there were enough little elements promising more than was delivered to make this film especially disappointing.Unless you are writing a thesis on Arriaga and are obligated to see everything that has his signature, don't waste your time on this one."
3,Wasting Potentials,"In the best tradition of Latino-American stories, two males and female enjoy each other ages, from schoolhood, or.More, probably, kind Gregorio, a self-mutilating schizophrenic, takes an upper hand being the Tanya's first and then got married her still fancying Manuel.A story of lust, love triangle and dramatic end, where flashing male-hoods might attract some audience additionally."
3,the night buffalo,a good movie with a good cast of characters. i enjoyed it but probably will only watch it once. not a movie i would re-visit over and over.
3,Seer might be more talented at writing books,"I only got as far as the first story when my dog, Harry got the book and destroyed, it. I felt the first story was an honest portrayal of how it is to be young and influenced by fear, and peers both."
2,Not Her Best,"When I saw this CD for sale on Amazon I was really looking forward to hearing it. Unfortunately, it is far from her best effort. The only other CD I have of her's is ""Yelling at Mary"", which is much better than this CD. This doesn't even seem like the same artist. Overall, I'm very disappointed with ""Wanderlust Diaries""."
2,A little too Klezmer-ish,"I bought this CD expecting to hear some old fashioned tamburitza style music, WRONG! This group of talented and accomplished musicians missed the boat on their interpretations of old Serbo-Croat songs. This CD sounds more like the Klezmer music at a Jewish wedding not traditional ""narodna"" style found throughout Ex-Yugoslavia. There is too much of screechy violin music remiiniscent of Hungarian czardas or Klezmer. Although very talented refugees make up this group, they should have stuck to the main theme of Serbo-Croat folk music."
4,good buy,"Powerslide is a good game, though it does take a bit of time to really get the hang of controlling it. The tracks are a lot of fun, but unfortunately, there aren't very many of them(if I remember right there's 8 circuits, one stunt area, and one luge run). Also, there aren't very many cars. Each car has different characters who drive them, which just means paintjob choices, and minor alterations to the height and frontend in some cases. Each character has a little bio that you can read, which is fun but, sadly, pointless.Powerslide is good, but it could've been an amazing game if only it had a more reasonable number of tracks and cars.It's good for killing a reasonable amount of time."
2,Disappointing sound quality,"Most disappointing. I have to agree with the 2007 review. I've listened to this recording both in this release and in its incarnation in the Essential Sibelius compilation, also from BIS. Heard over my reference-quality headphones, the string tone is quite annoyingly nasal compared to the vast majority of orchestral recordings even to other recordings from these performers (such as the Sibelius symphonies, also on BIS). Given the importance of the strings in Sibelius orchestrations, there are other, better-sounding recordings of these pieces that serve the music much better, such as the bargain box of the complete tone poems conducted by Neeme Järvi(Deutsche Grammophon)."
4,Superb first person blaster with excellent multiplay,"The N64's rapidly becoming king of this genre with games like Turok 2, Goldeneye and now Quake 2. This is an amazing PC conversion with the added advantage ( for those of us in the UK anyway ) that you don't have to run up a huge phone bill whenever you want to kill some friends. Everything that made the PC version great is here. Its fun,challenging,atmospheric and, like every great game, it has a rocket launcher. And thats just the single player game. Multiplayer is fantastic and shames the PC versions internet play. It's one of only a few games that even comes close to Goldeneye. The only flaws are the graphics aren't too impressive, even with an expansion pak and like I said, it still can't touch 007 but then again, there's no shame in being beaten by the best."
1,Quake has graced the N64 twice in a row-but parents watch out!!!-,"Quake II,in a way is like doom 64 except without the demons and such,is a really high grade N64 FPS,but it has it no no's details below.1)The violance is very high and the gore is too.2)There are dead partial eaten looking bodies in the first few levels of thegame.3)With the ambient sounds and such are sure fire way to make your average 3-year-old/easy to scare people wet their pants.note to parents: even if your kids beg like they've never begged before for this game,just say NO!!( even if they are 17 or older)signed sir drusel"
4,Frag!,"This game is great! Even though there are barely any levels to beat in one player mode, but multiplayer is just fun! It's a great game! The only bad thing about multiplayer is that you can't have computers to play with you."
2,Very UNsurprising graphics,"I had played Quake 2 on the computer before I rented it on the N64...expecting the graphics to excede those of the computer, but in actuality, they were rather mediocre. Now I'm glad I didn't buy it for the N64. The controls were rather dificult to learn as well (as compared to playing it on the computer first)."
4,"John Fahey, Guitarist",I listened to John Fahey when I was in High School and college. Haven't heard much of him since but purchased a CD. A fine bit of Classical Guitar.
5,Includes recipes and other creative touches of celebration,"A simply wonderful addition to New Age Studies reading lists in general, and Wicca reference collections in particular, Celebrating Celebrating The Seasons Of Life: Samhain To Ostara by Ashleen O'Gaea (a founding board member emeritus of the Tucson Area Wiccan-Pagan Network and Senior Corresponding Priestess for the Neo-Pagan prison ministry Mother Earth Ministries) superbly presents an informed and informative introduction to the ancient lore, metaphysical rituals, Wiccan symbols, and spirituality enhancing exercises associated with primeval celebrations as Samhain (October 31st), Yule (December 21st), Imbolc (February 2nd), Ostara (March 21st), and others high holy occasions in the nature worshiping seasonal calendars. Very highly recommended and enhanced with easy-to-follow Circle casting directions for groups and individuals, Celebrating The Seasons Of Life also includes recipes and other creative touches of celebration."
1,Hurt my babies tummy,Do not buy this product-could hurt your babies tummy. I gave it to my 15 month old for 4 weeks and she woke up at least 8 times during the night letting out a loud scream for the entire 4 weeks. A few times I noticed her legs tucked up tight to her belly. I couldn't figure out what was wrong. I stopped the vitamin and she went back to sleeping through the night instantly. You can imagine how terrible a mother would feel knowing that she was trying to do what's right for her baby and find out that it was hurting her.
1,TASTE HORRID!,My baby will consume almost anything willingly; he gave these a try for about a week and now refuses them. I tasted them myself and was horrified. They are super bitter and chalky and neon orange in color.
1,It is like orange flavored Polyvisol,Our doctor gave us Polyvisol and my baby hated it. I also tried it and I had a burning sensation in my throat after I swallowed. I found a great multivitamin but I wanted to add DHA so I ordered a bottle of Infant Care Multivitamin with DHA. I was very disappointed when we tried it. It has the same horrible flavor as Polyvisol but with orange. It is very bitter and gives me the same burning feeling in my throat.I can imagine to add it to orange juice but my baby does not drink it.Now we are going to give a chance to a bottle of Nordic DHA.
4,Great Multi for babies and toddlers,"This is just like Dr. Greene's vitamin drops. I bought this one because it has DHA also.My son hasn't breastfed since he was 3 months old, so he needs the extra DHA and vitamins.His formula has some, but, why not more. Now that he is two he can chew up vitamins, but esp. for1-2 year olds. Also the concentrated forms are better because the body doesn't have to break it downand is easily digested. Only downfall is that is too bright (maybe an orange dye). It has an orange flavor."
5,Great magazine for artists,"Interesting, trendy ad work presented in a very nice magazine. Definitely worth the money. My husband is a photographer and this is one of his go-to magazines for inspiration."
1,Stay away,"I checked this book out at the library, and it's full of blatant lies with no sources, the sheer number of quotes with absolutely no factual backing is simply astonishing, it attributes all manner of racist, bigoted, plutocratic, oppressive language to people who never uttered it.Truly a sickening piece of work by a sick mind, stay away, far away."
4,Interesting compilation of quotations made by liberals...,"This came as my gift for joining the Conservative Book Club. The author has assembled a vibrant collection of quotations... He makes it a sort of a guessing game trivia type deal. He points out the fanatical anti-family, anti-religion, anti-market, anti-western socialistic internationalist agenda. Hearing liberals in their on crude, behind the scenes frankness, unmasks their true intentions and their radically Marxist agenda. Moreover, he presents each quote with annotated commentary. I appreciate this unabashed paleoconservative way of putting things in perspective.. Its a break from the politically correct rhetoric of neoconservatives."
4,Covers more than just Lyme disease,"Although the book rambles somewhat in a story telling way, it covers useful information about a treatment option that many people with Lyme, CFS, FM, MCS, ADHD, Sick Building Syndrome and many other disorders that Shoemaker classifies as neurotoxin mediated illnesses may benefit from. I wish the book covered in more detail the exact methods and testing procedures that he uses, because from information I've learned elsewhere he does more than just test with the Contrast Sensitivity Test and give cholestyramine to his patients. But the book is a good starting point to learn about his theories."
3,Good beginning,"These guys have it in them, just hope they keep heading in the right direction. They have the makings of a really good group if they keep it up."
4,A must for every Star Wars fan !,"Awesome graphics, fantastic music, strong story-line, and most importantly, everything that the movies have : sandtroopers on dewbacks, jawas riding sand-crawlers, AT-AT's, etc.You won't regret for buying it. END"
4,Absolutely Marvelous,Much better than Shadows of the Empire. Good handling and fitting music make this game one of the best. END
4,"Rogue Squadron, the best of it's kind","the new star wars game, rogue squadron, is probably one of the best games I have played in a while. There is non-stop action, whether you're battling grounded imperial walkers, or chasing TIE fighters high in the sky. Rogue Squadron makes the perfect gift for any occasion. END"
4,This game is very good and I think you should get it.,"I think this game is pretty good. I saw screen shots from Nintendo Power and it think the graphics are very good, and when you fly away the music calms. When you get close to the action the music begins to go with the action. END"
4,If you like Star Wars you'll love this game!,"The graphics are supurb. You get to fly with all your favorite rebels from the movie. If you liked the 1st level of Shadows of the Empire, and wished there were more levels like it, then this is the game for you! JUST REMEMBER: You need a good 3D graphics card to handle the game. END"
4,Star Wars: Rogue Squadron,"This game is excellent, with a few exceptions. The first exception is the fact that despite the fact that there are 15 regular missions, not one of them is set in space. Every mission is set within the confines of a planet, be it in the upper atmosphere or skimming the surface. This isn't a crippling disadvantage, except some people like fighting in space. Ideally, this game would have both space and surface fighting. Another bad point is the lack of diversity in opponents. There are basically 6 enemies you'll run into - TIE Bombers, Fighters, Interceptors, Stormtroopers, Missile and Laser turrets. Thats basically it for opponents. Not that that is bad at all, it just gets boring after a while. Other then this, this game is excellent in all respects. A definate must have for any hardcore Star Wars fan."
3,Atari put out better games than this twenty years ago.,"This game has been a huge let down...The graphics are decent, but by no means superb. The AI does not exist--it's like playing some old arcade game where no matter how many times you start a level, EVERYTHING remains the same. If a Tie fighter comes out of the top left corner of the screen two minutes into the game, you can be assured that the same Tie fight will appear two minutes into any game until you beat that level. To make matters worse, the sound effects stink (what a waste of my good speakers!). In short, this game is nothing but a low brow, uninspired arcade fossile. If you want an interesting and FUN game, try Red Baron. I still have not found a game that beats it."
2,"Keeps crashing, and it's not my piloting","My computer has a vodoo 2000 and 96 megs of ram, yet this game crashes constantly. I was running alliancer with only 32 megs and the 4 meg video card that came with my Pc without this many lockups. Aside from that it's not a BAD game, alliance, Tie fighter and X-wing were all better, and I eagerly await starfighter for a good game with real strategy. And what is it with this game changing views on you randomly, like with the tow rope. It's like lucasarts is trying to be like microsoft and ""decide"" what you want."
4,One EXCELLENT game,"All I can say is WOW. This game is the best Star Wars game I've played. The graphics are amazing and the control(on the N64 version)are great. I've only played the Nintendo version, but I suspect the PC version is just as good. A MUST buy game!"

5,Corduroy is our favorite bear.,This book is very colorful and not wordy. I gave it to my 2 year old granddaughter for Christmas and it has become one of her favorite books. She loves to lift the flaps. We have read it over and over. This is a cute book for grandparents to get.
4,"Great Protein, Average Taste","This is a great source of protein. The taste of the bar is not bad, nor is it good, (it has a faint taste of peanut butter, it is nice and chewy). the taste is average. If you want a ""yummy"" bar, try the DETOUR peanut butter caramel bar."
2,Artificial sweetener taste means thumbs down from me,"I bought a box of the Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip, but I have to say that these bars really disappointed me. The ingredients look great on paper and the bar *looks* delicious from the picture on the wrapper, but the bar has a subtle but incessant artificial sweetener taste (from the sucralose, I'm guessing) that I can't stand. Sucralose is literally the second to last thing on the ingredients list, so I didn't think it'd be a factor in the bar's taste, but I was evidently wrong.I've been eating protein bars for 15 years now, going back to the days when they tasted like cardboard, and I can honestly say that I much prefer the taste of those old-school bars vs the taste of this particular Detour bar with it's ""fake-sweet"" undertones. I suppose if you're used to diet sodas, then you'll probably be right at home, but if you're not a fan of artificial sweeteners, be warned."
3,PROTEIN BAR,"Tasty, but a little sticky. Also gave me mass heart burn and indigestion....not sure why as most protein bars do not."
4,Fun movie,"Great movie, a lot of fun for the family. I give it 4 stars because there is some profanity in the movie."
5,Got to like this one .,Great one .Everyone kids grandpaw even the pets will get a bark out of this one .Took me back to when I was a kid worth renting .Or buying
5,Great movie,Bought it for my nephew and he is crazy about the movie. He was surprised to get it and he is now ready to go on the road...
2,A donkey with antlers?,"Mildly entertaining, but really, a donkey made up to be a moose? And a bull moose at that, supposedly protecting a calf (only the mother would do this) then carrying the boy off on his antlers--for a film purporting to be about wildlife experts, the wildlife scenes are just too silly and false. The scenery, however, is beautiful, good for city kids to see..."
4,Family fun,"We saw this movie years ago and were delighted to find it on DVD. Our kids enjoyed the movie tremendously and it was something we could watch when they were younger without having to 'edit' it, by our standards. The kids are adults now, and we still enjoy the movie!"
5,Love this movie!,"I can never find this movie anymore. Again, thank you, Amazon! It's a good movie I watched over and over again when I was younger. That didn't really change as an adult, I'm just saying."
4,"An enjoyable, interesting plot with well-done acting","I haven't seen this movie too often, but I really enjoy it every time that I do. Why? Because it is full of fun, adventure and mild comedy. The acting is wonderful, all of the three boys are terrific. However, this isn't necessarily a movie for younger children-it is geared towards pre-teens and teenagers. There is obscenities, implications, and alcholol use that isn't right for everyone.But, it is mad up for in the interesting plot. I don't know how much of this is true, but I enjoy it just the same."
5,Great all round film!,"I first saw this film in 1999 I loved it.The first thing that grabbed my attention was the 3 brothers and their relationship throughout the film and how it changes.The storyline with the youngest brother marshall was great.The film is like an adventure story,the type you would of loved to have gone on! Traveling,being young,free and inexperienced at almost everything.its a bit like a coming of age film,finding yourself etc.This all sounds heavy but its not,the film is filled with humour from the brothers and all the other characters,the animals are great and some even get in on the humour too.The music even grabs me,the whole thing is a feel good factor of a film,one I would recommend anyone watching of any age."
1,Family Film? No WAY!!!,"I bought this based on other reviews saying what a great family film this is. Hah! The language is foul. The early scenes have teens having beer parties ect. The rotten language is all through this film. The animals are so obviously phony that you'll laugh yourself silly. The acting is awful. The plot is boring. If you're looking for a beautiful outdoor wilderness film,I advise that you keep on looking...elsewhere.A Concerned Christian Mom"
1,Wild America,"I am very, very displeased. It is not March 31st, and I still have not received the movie. 5 - 15 days was stated for the movies arrival and currently, I am still waiting. The money was already taken out of my account... so I hope .. sooonnn.. I will received the movie so I can watch it."
5,Great!,The product came before it was scheduled to and in great condition. Great classic - good for most any age.
5,Just gets better and better,I had seen this many times and its still great! This movie has something for everyone from animal lovers and action lovers.
5,My favorite movie as a kid,i watched this movie at least once a week i loved it. This is still a great movie. I have not received this dvd yet
5,My 3 boys loved it!,"It has plenty of adventure without the bad language or half naked women. (shows like this are hard to find!) A little on the silly side- It is a fun, feel-good movie."
3,Not Bad,Okay so I wouldn't say this is the best movie I've ever seen. But I still really enjoyed it. I liked how they showed the relationship between the three brothers. Sure they picked on JTT but they still protected him especially Devon Sawa. He was more protective of him than Scott Bairstow. I liked the end and How JTT showed there father that they needed to find there own dream and the permission to follow them. So I'd reccomended it to Brothers and children 10 and Up. Sure The animals looked fake but It was still enjoyable.
4,Wild America,"Kids love this movie. As an adult I can nit-pick all I want, but the simple truth, is that kids love this movie."
1,Blum locking brackket,Broke within a year and customer service thru Omega cabinets is AWFUL. Dealer was no help at all. Stay with a good brand name.
2,Not whAT i THOUGHT,The book was not what is pictured. I have the one with the lemon on the cover ant thought that was what I was getting so a bit disappointed.
4,"Great, but do note the number of pegs!","This Geoboard is perfectly fine, but do notice that you are purchasing an 11x11 which means it has a gazillion pegs. Okay, not really a gazillion, but know that most math activities for young children are designed for a Geoboard that is a 5 peg by 5 peg (25 total). (Silly me, assumed the 11x11 was how BIG the board was, not the number of pegs...) Quality-wise, this is perfectly fine, while somewhat thin, and I assume will be useful some day. In the meanwhile, off to buy a 5x5..."
3,Very small.,"I was excited to order these blocks for my two year old. However, they are much smaller than I anticipated. Good quality, though."
3,Characters not engaging,"I love the Cat Who books, but this one just didn't ""click"" with me. Perhaps it was Qwill being away from Pickax and meeting a raft of new people. Except for Chrysalis, most of the new characters were stereotypes (uninteresting)."
3,Loose Ends,"I read the Cat Who when I need comfort food for the mind. The series is relaxing, enjoyable reading, but.....either I am too dense to understand, or the author leaves too many loose ends.In this book, for example, what was the meaning of the clump of yellowish hair found under the hunt board? And Lucy - the deceased's Doberman - who was taking care of her and feeding her? What role did she play in the mystery?I love the settings of these books. Maybe that is why the series is so -- for the most part -- comfortable. Now I want to visit Bad Axe, Michigan!"
1,That cat THAT was a leftie!,"This was my last book: I can no longer stand Mrs. Braun's leftwing, environazi diatribes! She started quite mildly, with the use of ""Ms.""--although for women known to be married or single--than evolved to perorations on smoking, economy cars and food. (I won't be there to see how long she'll allow Qwil to drink coffee!) She then started elaborating more, with the use of rainforest, wetlands, until this book, where the envirohippies are the good guys and the regular people are the bad ones. The climax is Qwil getting more and more annoying with his unsolved sentimental affairs--a man his age should have already solved his fear of marriage!--and his ultra-pampering of two ultra-egotistic cats. I got enough of her non-sense."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"I worked with Aileen Coleman in Jordan for about two years. I agree with the author's high view of her and the work she hsa done in the Middle East. Aileen is a fascinating and engaging woman who is full of many, many more stories like those in this book. What an honor and privilege it has been to know her and work with her! As of this review, the book is available only through third party sellers. Maybe Samaritan's Purse has new copies, if you're interested in reading it."
2,NOT GREAT FOR PET OWNERS,"I love carpet sweepers for a fast clean up and a way to conserve energy. The Ewbank Multi-Sweep is a solid, well built appliance. However, if you have pets, you will find that it takes more time cleaning the sweeper than it does to actually sweep the room. The Ewbank does pick up pet hair most effectively but emptying it is a bit awkward. You need to take a rag to clean out both dirt trays and then you need a small tooth comb to pull the hair out of the brushes and the wheels. To do a proper cleaning takes quite a bit of time. My old Bissell is easier to clean when it comes to pet hair and it does a great job.If you do not have pets, I would recommend this product because it is definitely well made and for small cleanups, it would suffice. For those who complain about appliances being made of plastic, unfortunately, these days, that's the norm. It's not great and plastic definitely does not hold up but, sadly, product quality is no longer a priority in business."
1,Dumps as fast as it picks up!,This broom just spit the dirt out as fast as it picked it up. Not worth even considering - I bought this first thinking it was the more expensive model and therefore must be better. WRONG!!! Fortunately Amazon took it back and I bought a Bissel unit at less than half the price that works fantastic.
4,It does a quick cleanup,"I was so pleased I received this product earlier than estimated from Amazon.com. The product itself is going to be fine. I purchased it for spot touch ups on carpet areas so I don't have to drag out the vacuum cleaner and it does a reasonably good job. For tile and hardwood, I don't recommend it, but then I use a swiffer in between vacuuming. I do find it difficult to clean out but simply make a mental note to vacuum out debris when I'm doing a regular cleaning of the home. Suits my needs just fine."
4,Good for use between vacuuming for a quick cleanup,"I'm glad I purchased this item as it is a quick way to clean up small messes without having to drag out the vacuum. I especially like the fact that it isn't using any electricity, so it is a genuinely ""green"" product! I use it exclusively on commercial carpeting and it works well."
2,Was not happy with the product at all,The information about the sweeper said you pushed the button on top and it would open the bottom flaps to empty the dirt. The button does nothing...you have to open the flaps by hand. I wish I had not purchased the sweeper.
4,Novice Review of the Classics,This version of On the Nature of The Universe is very high quality and quite readable for beginners like me. The translation is just modern enough to bridge the language of old to our modern conventions. I highly recommend this book.
2,"Great Book, Bad Edition [Penguin]","This is my favorite book. I've been through three different copies: a now out-of-print Classics Club copy, the Loeb Classics Library copy with the original Latin facing the English text, and this Penguin edition. The Penguin is by far the worst of those three. Among its faults is the fact that it's translated into prose, which makes for an easier read but in the end dumbs down the text and reduces it in beauty; and while the footnotes are sometimes informative, most of them I find insulting to both the reader's and Lucretius's intelligence. Go with the Loeb, or some other edition; chances are it's better than this one."
4,overall pleased with it.,product does what it says but most the time while driving it will flash and which is a dead giveaway that its fake...
1,Want real protection? Put a hungry pitbull in your interior.,"I purchased this a while back. And while it did it's ""job"" of blinking when the vehicle was rocked or significantly moved - does it deter? I highly doubt it. Another negatory: just the 2 sided adhesive that it comes with. After a hot summer day in the sun - you'll lose that adhesive and need to put on something stronger. It just looks unprofessional, it's a waste of money for an LED circus to go off and it's more novelty than security in the end."
1,JUNK Product,"Absolute Junk product, do not buy. Works when it wants to, needs to be in an area that receives ALOT of direct sunlight, LEDs are not that attention calling in the first place. Do Not Buy."
5,Perfect!,I didn't want to buy a professional anti-theft system because I can't trust anyone with my car's electrical system. This product does the trick. It's a good deterrent. I've owned this light for three years and it's still working like a charm. Highly recommended!
1,Worst Toy Ever Purchased From Amazon,I bought three of these for my two 6 year olds and my 7 year old. Every one of them arrived in abysmal condition. Strings everywhere... loose tuning screws that could not be tightened... and scratches. I could not believe that anyone would sell something this inferior. Shocking is an understatement describing this purchase.
2,cute but poor quality,"This is an adorable guitar and it's the perfect size for my two year old but it's made cheaply. The strings loosen after he strums it for a couple of minutes which means I'm retightening the strings each time he plays with it. I guess you get what you pay for (afterall, it was only $14.99)!"
3,"Low quality for the price, but the kids love it anyways","You could probably find this at a local flea market for $5....Regardless, my kids fight over it. The bridge fell out and I told them I'd glue it, but they don't seem to mind picking it up and putting it back into place over and over and over... Sounds awful, if you're buying it to join a band or play a real song, you'd better keep looking. Good play value, just too high a price for the quality."
2,Okay if you're tone deaf.,"I bought this item for my 7-year-old's birthday. It looked fabulous when it came out of the package, but won't stay tuned... the strings don't tighten. It'd be okay if it were a dollar toy, but for $20, I expect better quality. The good news is that my daughter has no idea that it doesn't work properly... she just thinks it looks really cool!"
1,Very cheap,"Bought this knecklace, but it was very cheap looking. One of the ""diamonds"" fell out of the heart already and has started to turn colors. Only a month old."
2,not very impressive,"If you already know about sport psychology, it says nothing new or unheard of. If you do ot know anything about that subject, it might be interesting to you. A bit dated anyway."
4,original,i bought for a freind who is a chaplin amongst christians and odinists....the spike for christ and the hammer for thor!
3,Nothing special,"I am a 42 year old female with extremely dry lips all year round - I have to keep something on them at all times (whether it's lip gloss or lip balm). As a result of my condition, I am constantly looking for a new product that can improve my dryness and when I saw this on Amazon, I thought that I would give it a try.Basically, you are ordering a SET of 6 individual lip balms with this product. They are advertised as Cocoa Butter, and it lists this in the ingredients, but this is only one ingredients in the list of standard lip balm ingredients (like Petroleum).I had hoped that it would have a great ""summer"" smell to it based on the Cocoa butter, but honestly, it has no smell at all. Regarding coverage, it's an average lip balm. It goes on thin and smooth - much smoother than Chapstick which always feels waxy on my lips. It doesn't last any longer than any other product that I have tried.In summary, I don't consider this to be any special and thus, do not plan to reorder it."
5,Great product at a great price!,"As a man who has always been troubled with dry, chapped lips. I tried all the other brands until i was at a Walgreens drug store one day and found these, on sale for a dollar, so i gave them a try. Needless to say my wife and i have been hooked ever since. Nice feeling lip balm w/o the shiny, sticky feeling of some of the girly lip gloss'. Apply once in the morning and ur good for the day. Absolutely none of that bad taste of chap stick. Walgreens don't carry them any more so i was glad i found them here. Good job Amazon. Two thumbs up!!"
2,Buy a different case,It is annoying to have to take the case off and get it back on. You need to do it everytime you want to charge it and put it on its holster or it won't fit on. The case ripped after a day as it is not durable or easily reusable. I recommend buying another case for sure and regret buying this myself.
3,This is LARGE PRINT?!!!,"I bought this Bible for my 84-year-old mother who is having difficulty seeing, and while the print in this Bible is larger than the print in a phone book, it looks like no larger than 12 point print--the same size as in a normal book. The Bible is the Bible, and the NRSV is a great translation, but I was really disappointed by the publisher's definition of large print."
2,"""Large Print"" May Mislead","Every Bible is a Good Book, so I don't criticize the content -- however, we found that the print was smaller than even the pew Bibles in our church. Therefore, I returned them, and continue the search for some very large print Bibles to be used by folks who have poor eyesight."
5,I'm happy,"I think that the other reviews cover it... I'm very impressed with the over all instrument and case. After about 10 minutes of setup and tuning I was up and playing. The only other thing I can recommend is replace the factory strings with a decents set of Martins... (Your fingers will thank-you...) Check out ""DerFest"" on Facebook you may get to see and hear mine one day."
3,Needs a set up to play well,I'm a guitarist but I have played a few mandolins. The Washburn M3SWK has potential but not right out of the box. The two I tried and returned had issues. the first one fretted out on the fourth string at the octave and the second one came with the bridge saddle broken.These were issues I didn't want to deal with after waiting for a week to get the mandolin. If set up properly I think the M3SWK will sound and play reasonably well. but there are plenty of other brands to compare with in this price range. I would suggest buying one from an online music shop that will set the instrument up before shipping it to you.
5,"Better than chess, more strategic than Mage Knight","This set is GREAT! The gameplay is REALLY fun. I had my doubts when I first saw them I thought that they were a little too out of proportion (They resemble the clone wars cartoon a little bit). But I decided to go with it. Here is my advice: If you don't want to get addicted/obssesed over anything, don't buy this. There is als a carrying case/game board, that is going to be released June 1, It comes with a Clone Seargent, and new rules for a capture the flag game. This set comes with Obi Wan, Darth Vader (Before he was in the suit), A clone commander, a Wookie Commando (My favourite) and 1 random figure (I got a clone trooper). It also came with a CD, which I haven't used yet, but I bet it's great. Wave 2 of Attacktix is also coming, It will include a new Republic Gunship, Dart Maul, and Jango Fett, plus any more! So hurry and buy a starter set before everyone else does!"
3,Attacktix Miss The Mark!,The pieces are poorly made and will not withstand the test of time needed for battling your opponents. Ours didn't even withstand the test of handling.
3,Vol.17: Oldies and Newies,"This volume opens with ""The Adventures Of Harry Chess"" by ""A.Jay"" (Al Shapiro), reprints from DRUM magazine from 1964-65. Fun, quirky, cartoony stuff! Other highlights: ""Virgin"", starring ""Jack Masters Private Dick"" by Joven; ""Coley Meets Doctor Sade"" by John Blackburn (one of his most bizarre episodes, this would have fit in an ""S&M special""-- OUCH!); ""Stud Stars"" by Sean (a pair of travelling guitarists ""play"" at a surprising venue); ""Murphy's Manor"" by Kurt Erichsen; and 12 more fun cartoons by Gerald Donelan (who gets both color covers this time out)."
3,Its a great game,"This is a great game, and easily teh best of the series, but I am tired of Lara Croft, and they need to innovate on this game a LOT more, because it is the same stale experience, all over again."
3,It's gripping at first but gets tiresome.,"TR3 really gripped me at first but it has come to irritate me after a few days of working my way through the levels. The imagery is great, but there area few bugs. What really frustrates me is how finicky the game is regarding the angle of a jump and whether Lara is one or two paces from the edge of the boulder she is jumping off. I bought the game to enjoy. Life is too short to spend another twenty minutes of it getting Lara across yet another stretch of water!"
2,The third installment of a tired series,"The Tomb Raider series has grown quite stale, and playing this new installment of the series just reaffirms the fact. The first Tomb Raider was decent, the second was lacking, and this one is basically the two combined with some new graphical specs here and there. And we all know graphics don't make the game, don't we? The game is basically set outdoors most of the time, with some temples here and there of pretty good size, but the sheer amount of frustration put into every level just isn't worth getting angry over. Whether it be the extravagant number of gunshots to kill something, or finding that little item on the ground to get you past the current area, you WILL get stuck and you WILL get frustrated way too much then it should be. I suppose Lara's trademark ""gravity-defying breasts"" keep this series from going down the drain by the large number of mid to late pubescent teens out there, but if you want a good PC platerformer, I'd look elsewhere."
1,get original now,"how many tomb raiders are there now? I bought this one and I think it stinks, Tomb Raiders 1 and 2 are much more fun, this one also makes Windows 95 crash."
3,OK OK......................,"Have you ever sat for hours playing one particular video game and you can never find out what to do? This is one of those games. Although it does hold a great assortment of fun weapons and great graphics, but it's hard. You don't just go around firing guns at everything. Although I did not like the first Tomb Raider either, only because many of the enviroments looked exactly the same though. They both are good games but if your not willing to put a lot of time into video games and just play for fun like me, your not going to like this one."
5,The best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,It is one of the best tr games.It has a well built story line{ok not better than tr4 but this is an other matter.It is very good.That's all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,The most over-rated series ever.,"To this very day I still cannot understand why everyone loves Tomb Raider so much. Aside from the odd improvement here and there, the games haven't changed vastly (I think Doom to Quake is vastly) at all. I find controlling Lara very clumsey, the 3rd person view not help. Plus, Lara does all the aiming so the satisfaction of blasting something's head off from a distance is non-existent. I found myself fart around half the time. Where's the fun in climbing up a rock face? I'm all for puzzles but I find these games boring and labourious. Oh, and Lara Croft is not fit because she's not real and if she was she'd fall forwards due to her massive mammaries. So stop ogling at your screen, you sad people!"
3,A bit dissappointed.,"I enjoyed Tomb Raider II much more. The TR3 is designed so you must buy the strategy guide. I don't see how anyone without massive amounts of time and patience could ever figure out some of the puzzles such as knowing the precise order to push numerous buttons - only one solution. I don't care for the many dark backgrounds, either. I definitely suggest playing TR2, though."
1,Not another Tomb Raiders?,"I thought this game would have been as cool as the other tomb raiders p.1 and 2. This one was a disappointment for me. Especially because the game keept crashing my computer. I do have a new computer, but the thing kept crashing it. I think Tomb Raiders 1 was much better than this one."
4,"Good, but not as good as","Good, but not as good as how to cut and paste, 30s edition. I really enjoy the newness and quirk of DJ Yoda's style, and so it's hard to go wrong with any of his albums...but his best is totally the 30s edition!"
2,Complex steps with poor cueing,"As an avid exerciser, I'd heard lots of good things about Cathe's videos. So I finally decided to buy this one. I was disappointed. She doesn't cue very well at all and just overcomplicates all the moves. Apparently ""advanced"" for her, just means ""complicated"". I've done step aerobics before and had no problems. I have other videos with complex choreography that I have no problems with. This one, left me not even wanting to bother with the entire video because I couldn't get the moves down between the crazy complex moves and the poor cueing that went along with it. Bummer, because I was really looking forward to it."
2,Clock lasted only 1 year,"I purchased this clock in February 2006, and it worked great for 1 year. This year the clock began to reset time to the Eastern Time Zone, regardless whether other time zones were selected. I tried different brands of batteries, and still the same problem. Now the clock won't work at all. I downloaded the product manual from the La Crosse website, to see if there was something I was missing. I tried the troubleshooting steps recommended, but without success. I do not recommend this clock."
4,Works - It's a Clock,"The back panel broke when taking it out of package, that is the packaging though not the clock. It is in working order and keeps one 'on time'."
2,Doesn't Work Well,Pros: The clock looks GREAT!Cons: Doesn't pick up the atomic signal in my apartment and is therefore a real pain to set up properly.
1,Bad quality,This is a horrible clock. It is not made well and does not keep accurate time. I will never buy LaCrosse products again.
2,Nice Looking Clock ......but,"Received the clock, installed new batteries and within a few hours it had obtained the signal and was working fine. Next morning, however, I found the sweep (seconds) hand had stopped even though the clock was keeping correct time (hours/minutes). I was able to tap it several times to get it going again but alas the sweep hand kept stopping. I replaced the batteries with a new set and same result. I ended up sending it back to Amazon for a replacement (defective). When the replacement arrived, one corner of the shipping box was smashed in and also the corner of the clock box also. Unfortunately, the clock was destroyed.....broken glass face and one of the hands was badly bent. Gee, I really did want the clock, but after two attempts, I gave up and sent the replacement back and asked for a refund."
3,Something out of nothing,"It's amazing how much of an aura of mystery the obscure Boba Fett has acquired in the Star Wars mythos. In the films, this character has about a half dozen lines tops, but the mysterious armor, demeanor and standing as one of the greatest bounty hunters in the galaxy piqued fans' interest.In ""Enemy of the Empire,"" we see Fett's first encounter with Darth Vader. Writer John Wagner takes a humorous look at some of the denizens of the Star Wars galaxy and we get to find out how Fett received that odd dent in his helmet that appears in both Episodes V and VI.""Enemy"" didn't win any Eisners (comics' highest award), but it had solid storytelling and art (even if the latter was somewhat cartoony). A nice, light read featuring that mysterious bounty hunter on an adventure that fits quite nicely in the Star Wars epic."
4,Fett vs Vader and awesome Cover art.,"This is a review of Star Wars - Boba Fett - Enemy of the Empire TPB, a collection of 4 issues of a wizard magazine comic - Salvage published Oct 1999 as ISBN 156971407x, Printed in Canada.This is one of the finest comic Dark horse has ever produced. It is beautifully produced with above average artwork, excellent inking and superior binding. I have sat and read through this comic many times and it has never fallen apart in my hands. The story is action packed, featuring a duel between Vader and Fett. Ken kellys cover art is a 5, the story is a 4, the inking is a 4. The artwork is generally a 2 and a 3 often resembling the comic strip style rather than the rich art we now see in later comics. There were 3 different illustrators with unequal results. But for 1999 this was awesome."
3,Not as good as I expected,"After getting ""Digital Photo Processing"" by Chris Tarantino and flipping through the pages, I was somwhat dissapointed. This is definately for an entry level digital photo enhancer. Most of the techniques are pretty obvious, and a few demonstrate an unprofessional technique and result. I was considering other titles in this series, but now, I think I'll invest in a different line of books."
2,Its a hit when it works,I bought this toy for my son and nephew. They both loved it . Mine unfortunately broke the second day. I believe the remote control got bent somehow. I don't find it very durable.
2,"Great watch, but can't set the time right...","tried every combination (not just me) but can't set the right time...probably have to take it to a store to take the battery out & place it back at an exact hour.the time could be changed only in quantities of 30 min.other than that simple matter, the watch looks great."
1,don't take in the water,I ahve always ben a timex fan and bought tthis for swimming. It fogged almost as soon as I entered the pool. Iam terribly disapponited in this watch...It is supposed to be waterproof to 40 meters and instead it fogged after being a meter deep and swimming a lap....
2,Didn't last long before leaking,My 11YO daughter bought this because she loves to know what time it is. She swims 5-6 times per week and the watch started fogging up after about 6 months. I'll look for another brand next time.
2,Basic watch,"The watch is great looking and very basic. It does not have the date, which I miss from my other watch, nor any bells and whistles. If you want just a basic watch that has the time, you will like this."
3,Meh,"After a year and a half of continual wear, the band on this watch cracked. I'm not sure how long I expect a watch band to last, but I showered it it very rarely, so I guess I wanted it to last longer than this. It's also pretty beat-up looking in general. There has been a white scrape on the face for months now and I don't know where it came from.I never figured out how to set the thing or use the stopwatch. I would just push buttons until finally the right time would turn up. I'd say it usually took 3 to 8 minutes every time there was a time change.Besides those things, the watch keeps perfect time. Just what I expect from a Timex."
4,Great book,"I have always loved this book since the first time I read it. It is so suspenseful and fast-paced. ""Twilight Eyes"" keeps you on the edge of your seat and does not disappoint. One of the best Dean Koontz books out there."
2,Let me explain as if part of the book Twilight Eyes...,"...That every possible item, each character, all emotions and every action is repeatedly examined in excruciating detail from all possible angles and then reiterated at least twice. That nothing is ever left un-spoken (or un-written). That the descriptions of even the most inconsequential events continue for page, after page, after page. That the character dialogue and conversational banter chatter on and on like a mountain stream endlessly flowing to become the mighty Amazon before dumping its long winded babble into an ocean of excessive words......If this was actually a excerpt from the book, the verb-age concerning TOO MANY WORDS would go on for at least 5 or 6 more pages...Get the massage?... No?... Then read the book. All will be explained... IN DETAIL."
3,Very Very long,This book was just too long and far fetched for me. It started out good but then it got kinda boring and the ending didn't really do it for me. I wouldn't recommend this book because because the whole idea of these creatures planing for a nuclear war and to take over didn't appeal to me.
3,"not scary, just weird",The fact that the goblins looked like pigs made the whole story not scary at all.
3,"Dean-o, you should have left well enough alone...",Word is that this was a shorter novel that Koontz went back and fleshed out. He should have left well enough alone. The book starts strong but descends into silly sci-fi about three quarters of the way through.
2,Good Idea .... Poor Execution.,"I'm going to keep this short and sweet...uh... alright sour. Dean Koontz is a second rate author, he can be lumped in with other successful hackhorror writers (King,Saul,Laymon) who cater to the blue collar mentality or better put, the easily entertained. This book like all Koontz's books starts off good ,wanes in the middle,and falls flat on it's face in the end. His books are so cliche ridden and predictable that I have to cover my eyes in disbelief and think the horror of it all. Read Clive Barker, Simon Clark, Phil Rickman, or anybody for that matter instead. HORRIBLY UNORIGINAL! would have been a more appropriate title"
4,I enjoyed it,Interting subject. Charaxters are fleshed out. Caused me to nail bite wondering at the outcome. I always enjoy Dean Koontz books.
4,Classic Koontz!,Let me preface this by saying that I'm a really big Dean Koontz fan. I noticed before I bought it that it wasn't as highly rated as some of his other novels. After reading it I can honestly say Twilight Eyes is right up to the high standard of his best novels. That's why I gave it a 4. Read it. You won't be disappointed.
5,Without a doubt one of his best!,"Twilight Eyes was my 16th Dean Koontz book. It was definetely one of his best. The story centers around a 17-year-old guy with the bizarre name of Slim Mackenzie who has a psychic ability called ""Twilight Eyes"". He can see the goblins, evil, monstrous beings disguised as ordinary, everyday human beings. After murdering his goblin uncle who was terrorizing his family unsuspected, Slim runs away to the Sombra Brothers carnival to work as a carnie. There, he meets and falls in love with a beautiful older girl named Rya Raines. Slim is determined to continue his secret war with the goblins, but is he insane, or do such things really exist? Where did the goblins come from? What are they trying to achieve and why?If your a Koontz fan this is a must, and if you've never read Kootz before, this is a great place to start. Other favorites of mine include Intensity, Watchers, Whispers, The Door To December, The Funhouse, Phantoms, and Hideaway."
2,"No, thanks","I just re-read this as an adult, 15 years after reading it as a teenager. What a difference that made! Hoo, boy, does Mr Koontz like the sound of his own keyboard clicking away.There's some actual genius in the basic idea; that the most loathsome of human behaviour is not actually human at all (I suppose we'd all like to think that). But there's absolutely no excuse for the convoluted, torturous stuff that passes for his dialogue.An example, if you like:""I can still feel you within me, your seed, still so hot inside me, burning. I'll take it to bed with me, curl myself around the heat of your seed, and it'll be like a watchfire through the night, keeping the bad dreams away. No graveyards tonight, Slim. No, not tonight.""YEAH, CAUSE THAT'S HOW PEOPLE TALK.Idea? Muted yay. Execution? BOO. BOO. BOOOO."
4,One of Koontz's best,"The main character lives in a carnival and he has the ability to ""see"" the true nature of people. He sees that some of the population are really not human at all but some sort of an alien porcine like race that are secretly conspiring to hurt mankind. The plot is Twilight Zone esque and that is what made it appealing to me."
4,Twilight Eyes: What a Canival of Terror!,"You'll be pulled-in further as each page turns.A great piece of writing; as it slyly weaves together the behind-the-scenes life of society outcasts together with believable goblins, and frail human sacrifice and caring.Get ready to take the slow roller-coaster of terror; suspense and drama before the decent, and be ready as the cutting-edge chills will whiplash you with no mercy to the final chapter!"
3,Very Good Action-Packed Novel,"We all know and love Koontz for writing what I consider gripping tales of action/thriller/horror that I need during sleepless Transatlantic flights. I mean, the action is great and he knows how to move it along speedily, but this is obviously not a masterpiece. It is, however, very good. The story of a genetic ""freak"" who can see goblins posing as humans with the intention of wiping us off the face of the planet is good.Because the action is of foremost importance in Koontz' books, everything else tends to suffer. Descriptions are superficial or nonexistent, and characterizations are minimal. What you get in return though it tons of nonstop action. Satisfying."
3,What is it about amusement parks and thrillers?,"This was the first Koontz novel I read, I was about 13 and was indeed thrilled by it. But looking back it's not so good a novel in my opinion. Perhaps because I didn't like the bad guys. Joel Tuck is a great character though and Rya's ideas on nuclear war are thought provoking."
3,Just too many words!!!,"This is one of Koontz' books where he shows the reader how he can fall in love with himself! He is a true wordsmith, I will grant him that. He can turn many a fine phrase, but that is the main problem in this book, he turns way too many. Long, long passages that started to make my teeth grind! About 450 pages that could've been done in 350. Ernest Hemingway, he is not. Darkfall, which I read just before this had much more action and was better paced. I have read a number of his books, some like Darkfall and some like this one. I will just try to be more careful when buying another of his books."
1,incredibly tedious read,I am ususally a Koontz fan but he can get irritably detailed on his details and descriptions. I could only make it through a few chapters of this particular tedium. Do not waste your time. Read a psychology text instead.
3,i like the book but how is the kindle version more than paperback?,"my title says it all i recently bought a kindle fire and am looking for books i read along time ago, but would want to revisit at a later time to re read on my kindle. Upon specifically looking for this book i was seriously disappointed to see that the kindle version was in fact several dollars more than the actual book and this makes absolutely no sense at all."
3,"Great start, mediocre finish....","I would agree with the harsh critic. Very cool idea, but not so very good delivery. The idea of demons hiding amoungst humans causing ""accidents"" and out and out murder was very cool. Mr. Koontz then kind of spoiled it by giving it a lame explanation. Mr. Koontz has a tendancy to avoid true horror in his books to avoid being pidgeonholed as a horror writer. Sadly, the best Koontz books are his horror novels. Darkfall, The Frankenstein series and Phantoms are some of his best work. Mr. Koontz should have stayed the course with the horror in this book instead of changing to suspense half-way through. That is why I give it 3 instead of 5 stars. Twilight Eyes is good, but not great."
3,Boring and slow. Trust me.,"Before this book, I had 3 or 4 Koontz books. I had loved all of them. Some people write and say this is the best book they read, just for the sake of getting their review in print. Either that, or they are younger and haven't read other books of Koontz. If they had, they would've seen what a dissapointment this was. It began good. But after a while it just got plain boring. I stopped when the first part ended. I haven't tried to read again. This doesn't mean I will stop reading Koontz books! Oh no. He has many great books. I will continue to buy his books until he dies. Maybe even more after he does (=o))! It's just that this book was too slow for my taste. And the only thing it did fast was get boring. Oh well.PS: I agree with that one guy. The love scenes played out like an erotic story."
2,Dissapointing ending,"I've read two of Koontz' novels. It seems he often comes up with an interesting premise, which in the scond half of the book is ruined by preposterous and anti-climatic endings. I felt the same way about 'Cold Fire.'When the true nature of the Goblins is reaveled in this book, I thought to myself 'is that all they really are?' My imagination had dreamed up all sorts of interesting ideas only to be shot down by Koontz' less than amazing imagination.Perhaps Koontz fans like these sort of endings, but they are not for me."
2,Twilight Eyes,"The main character, Slim Mackenzie, lives in a carnival and has the ability to see the true nature of people. He sees goblins posing as humans with the intentions of wiping out the human race. I loved the fact that Dean Koontz went into such detail when describing the characters. You really feel as if you can see them standing in front of you. Slim was an exciting and alive character; also Rya and Joel Tuck were great characters. This was a well-written and fast-paced book, but I found it very hard to buy into. When the true nature of the book was brought out, I thought to myself is that all they really are?I was disappointed with the ending."
1,A waste of my time,"This is a very thin plot padded with lots of sex and terrifying descriptions of goblins. As far as the story, it would fit in a magazine. I am truly disappointed."
3,"Fantasy mixed w/ movie ""Frailty""","I read this book in high school, a while ago. I remember enjoying it a lot. The writing was somewhat sophomoric, but considering the fact I was a sophomore I did not mind. The story is pretty cool, demons among us and all that, and the ending takes a surprisingly apocalyptic end. Mingled with tales of an Atlantean pre-human civilization I think it was a very original turn for Koontz who's books mostly seem to be so similar you can barely tell them apart. If you like Koontz, read it. It is a lot different from his later work, and I think the freshness of the story makes up for his still-budding technique."
4,Awesome,I love Dean Koontz and this book was very good. He has a way of keeping you on the edge of your seat until the very end of the book.
5,Awesome,"I am still currently reading this novel. I find it compelling, and it's one of the great books I've read. I recommend it to anyone and all of my friends. Dean Koontz has a great talent to write and also has a great mind. I suggest you read this book."
3,DIFFERENT..............,This book was alittle on the strange side. I still am trying to sort through all the situations and characters....It was alittle creepy but not even close to Koontz's other scarey novels. It was kind of slow in some spots. The word DIFFERENT..comes to mind..
3,A new record for me,"Amazingly, I started this dook in October and just finished it in July - why did I not finish it earlier or just abandon the book? It was just good enough to keep going, but not good enough to keep me reading or reading other books while trying to continue. I always have a dilemma with Koontz. Some of his books are excellent, some are absolutely awful - Twilight Eyes falls in the middle. The premise is good, yet not executed as well as it could have been. Koontz is talented, yet this book illustrates Koontz's tendency toward what others have called diarrhea of the mouth - where he just rambles on and on about things that really don't help the plot. Though this is not some of his better work - I will continue to read his books."
5,"Had me ""seeing"" goblins hehehe","Funny, I borrowed this book from my sister and read it cover to cover in about 5 days....I read it while working at an atmosphere sorta like the carnival in the book, so it made my day at work more interesting (working at a fair, watching lots and lots of people walk by daily) The action is great and I like the sex scenes too....I really like the idea of deamons in mens clothing and skin......I think I may have met a few of mr koontzes goblins when at around the time I read the book I had a little stint at jury duty.....lets just say the judge and a few of the lawyers were giving me the chills after reading this book....room full of ""goblins"" hehe....I STRONGLY suggest that Mr Koontz make this book into a movie....or TV series....If you are reading this Mr Koontz please make a movie on this book, it would rule!well thats all, Im not intensly critical because Im easy to please.....and I have an open mind :)"
4,Quite the page-turner!,I love this story! I just finished reading it about an hour ago and was on edge with every page. It's an incredible story of good triumphing over evil and love conquering all.
4,a workable art o fiction,it was kinda droll starting out but after i got past the first forty or so pages it started to take off. and i mean it really took off! koontz really kicks ass! i will be reading more of his works. thanks mr koontzs
4,Very Good...but not Perfect,"Very good slicer...however, not 100% stainless steel...it is also chrome plated."
3,Leifheit made in China,"Leifheit Pro Line Stainless Steel Egg SlicerThe slicer I expected, was German made Leifheit. This is a heavy, casted metal, coated by thin layer o stainless steel coating( may peel in time).Wire cutting the egg, must be cleaned very carefully, may snap. I wish Amazon would state Made in China."
2,Only the wire cutters are stainless.,"It's okay, but I was disappointed. Only the wire cutters are stainless. The Slicer is chrome. I didn't want that because I knew it would start to show rust marks if I didn't dry it completely each time."
4,eggselent,I'm happy with my purchase. This slicer is solid and works great.I made egg salad and sliced the eggs in both directions and it was fast and efficient.
3,Egg Slicer,I received the Egg Slicer and one of the steel wires is loose (the end wire). I didn't expect this from a quality product.
5,The best egg slicer I've owned,"I went through a number of egg slicers, only to fine that the wires broke or bent and THEN broke in relatively rapid fashion. One year, I went through 3 slicers. When I took the time to do the reaearch, I found the Leifheit and am now in bliss. It is substantial and the wires are durable. My only problem with it is that you need to gently wash the wires immediately after use or they are difficult to clean. If you put it in the dishwasher, you probably wouldn't have that problem but I hand wash mine. I highly recommend this product. I'm buying one for my sister today."
5,Heavy duty,"What else can I say? It's a high quality egg slicer. It can slice my eggs either direction, which is a must for me, and I can slice many olives at once when I need sliced olives. Haven't tried anything else yet, but I have faith that it will give me lots of great use for many years. Well worth the extra money."
1,Very Disappointed,"I purchased this CD because I was one of the original ""towns people"" when it debuted at Manhattan School of Music in 1969-70. The website said that all of the cast members were listed on the CD. I was NOT listed, however, I still have the original handout, where I am listed as a cast member.Needless to say, I am very disappointed.A ""Townsperson from the Piper of Hamelin"""
1,Get a spray instead,I found this stuff to be horrible. I'm going to get a lube spray instead. Not sure why they'd even sell it as a gel.
5,One important tip,"With this simple and inexpensive adapter I installed the HDD from my deceased IBM NoteBook in my desktop PC in minutes.One tip: the NB drive needs to be configured as a slave by jumpering a couple of pins - a label on the drive shows which ones (not sure if this is the same for all NB drives but I suspect so). There was no jumper included with the adapter, but when I opened up my desktop PC there was a suitable jumper on the socket of main HDD. Transferred this jumper to the designated pins on the NB drive and the system booted faultlessly."
2,IDE Converter,"I bought a laptop HDD to IDE converter. I got what I paid for, the terminal connectors did not survive and I had to directly wire it to the power supply."
1,garbage,"This item is garbage. I tried every jumper configuration possible without shorting it to ground via the dreaded ""never do this"" position. I could not get the drive to be recognized.The item arrived in a box full of bubble wrap but no directions.The item is so cheap that it's not worth returning. Still, I can never get the 3 hours I wasted on this thing back so it was kind of an expensive failure. It didn't destroy my hard disk though and it still works fine in the laptop."
2,Does NOT fit any Dell laptop hdd,"This item definitely does NOT work with a Dell D610 harddrive. Pictures are worth a 1000 words, just not the kind you want to hear! Good thing Amazon makes returns easy!"
4,Cheap way to get the data.,"Works fine. It is a cheap way to get the data out of laptop harddrive.Now, if you don't mind spend just a little more money, they do sell case with usb connection that shell the laptop harddrive.I think they cost like $25-30.But since I only need to use it a few times, I save some money to be used else where."
4,Does exactly what it is meant to do!,This is a simple good product. It converts a 44-pin (laptop hard drive) to a regular IDE. CablesOnline shipped the order so fast. If you have any questions they are very knowledgeable and eager to help.
5,"Great product, fantastic seller!","I bought this as part of a set of the ""Van Gogh"" Moleskine notebooks as a present to an oenophile couple who was traveling through the Mediterranean. They love the fact that they can keep track of different categories of wines in the small notebooks, along with the ability to keep some of the wine labels in the signature Moleskine pocket in the back. The product itself is superb, and I've been a personal fan for a long long time - highly recommended.Furthermore, the shipper (""Moleskine Books"") really went above and beyond what I would have expected. They were pleasant to work with, quick to respond to questions, quick to ship, and really courteous from start to finish. Awesome product, awesome seller, I'm looking forward to ordering from them again!"
3,Terrorists,This was a movie about a true story. Even thought I like Angelina it was hard to watch. You know how it turns out so you have to work through the emotions and sadness which is the main theme. It is gritty and heart breaking. Good acting and characters but very hard to watch. I rated it a three because I like more uplifting movies. If you don't know the story then you may want to watch it but it is a downer.
1,Snooze fest,"If you suffer from insomnia,then watch this movie.I watched this with my wife and even she struggled to make it through to the end.highly overrated."
2,A Mighty Bore,"Although this movie was well made, the subject matter was really boring. I mean, Marianne Pearl and her supporters basically got nowhere in their search for Daniel Pearl. They didn't know where he was being kidnapped so they couldn't even rescue him. Most of the info that they got about Pearl was from the captors themselves. They were the ones who sent photos of Pearl, etc. Throughout the movie, all we get is: ""Did you see a foreigner in front of the Village Restaurant?"" Boring. There needed to be more drama and tension. I don't consider winding up in ""dead ends"" to be drama and tension. That may have been the way this story was, but then why make a movie out of it if it's going to be this boring. I can see why this movie bombed at the box office."
3,"MICHAEL WINTERBOTTOM, OPUS 16","*** 2007. Based on Mariane Pearl'sA Mighty Heart: The Brave Life and Death of My Husband, Danny Pearland directed by Michael Winterbottom. Angelina Jolie earned a Golden Globe nomination for her performance. Daniel Pearl, a journalist working for the Wall Street Journal, is kidnapped in Karachi, Pakistan. The film relates the events taking place until Daniel Pearl's tragic death. Apart of the always necessary task to relate the death of a journalist, I don't see what Michael Winterbottom had to say with this film. In terms of cinema, A MIGHTY HEART will not leave a durable trace in history. Already forgotten."
4,Based on True Story,"I enjoyed watching this movie, which is based on the true story for the search for journalist Daniel Pearl by his pregnant wife, journalist Mariane Pearl.This movie is really well acted by the entire cast and very well-written. The movie is nicely paced from start to end.I enjoyed the fact that we don't see the actual kidnapping, nor does the film show the violent, brutal way in which Daniel Pearl's life came to a tragic ending. Instead, this movie focuses on the efforts to find and rescue, Daniel Pearl, by his wife Mariane, along with the help of many others, before Daniel Pearl is killed by his kidnappers."
4,Moving story of Compassion despite terrible circumstances,"Enjoyed this movie much more than I thought I would. Since I didn't know if I would enjoy this, I watched the Special Features section about the making of the movie beforehand. This gave me a sense of the intimacy the director wanted in the movie, the personal contact actors had with the characters, particularly, Mariane Pearl, and their commitment telling her story well. It also made me appreciate how incredible a person Mrs. Pearl is. As a result, when I watched the movie, the intensity of the movie was balanced with a warmth and loyalty by the characters (and actors themselves). Although the movie originates from a terrible act and experience, Mariane's wisdom and the actors' heartfelt intent makes this a movie about rising above the fray, about compassion and seeing the world at large. Highly recommended."
4,Honoring,"I don't like Angelina Jolie. I don't know why exactly but I just don't but with this movie she really gave a good performance and changed my mind a little bit about her. I cann't review Marian Pearls book so I should have read this first before watching the movie.I could feel the pain and cry Angelina gave to this caracter. I found her performance beautifull, real and from her heart. She could have been nominated for an Oscar. I really believe this.This movie should have gotten more publicity in the Netherlands. I feel it hasn't and slipped a side as we want to know and learn more about this great journalist Daniel Pearl and his wife Marian.This movie will definitly be honoring him and will be remembered by everyone and for his son Adam."
1,"Choppy, Boring & Poorly Acted",This movie had terrible editing. It was so choppy you don't know what is going on. The acting is awful. It was hard to follow with all the bizarre character names. There are too many scenes that do nothing to enhance the story.The sound quality is so low I had to keep rewinding and turning volume up to hear it.The movie was so bad I couldn't finish it.
2,"A great Disappoint, too",Read the book. Don't bother with this movie unless you have a couple of hours to kill. This even was a tragedy but I didn't feel that with this movie. This movie misses the mark. .....read the book.
1,A Mighty Heart,I sent this video back to Amazon for credit a week ago because it would not play in my DVD I have not been contacted as of yet if they are going to give me credit. I purschased it on HD and was not aware it would not play on a regular DVD.Thankspatricia
2,Not good,This movie was so hard to get interested in... It was not one that got ahold of you at the beginning... I was very interested in the story but not the movie.... Dont waste your time or money in my opinion..
2,More Holes Than Swiss Cheese,"It's very difficult to put out a 4 CD history of Bluegrass music and leave as many gaps as does this compendium. There's some great music here, much of which isn't Bluegrass at all, but old-time Country Music (e.g. Gid Tanner, Uncle Dave Macon, Charlie Poole, etc). But Bill Monroe, The Stanley Brothers, and Flatt & Scruggs account for 50+ cuts. There isn't a single inclusion by Reno & Smiley, The Osborne Brothers, Jim & Jesse, The Country Gentlemen, Lonesome Pine Fiddlers, Jimmy Martin, Mac Wiseman and others, however. I gave the collection two stars because the purchase price was so low as to make it worthwhile for someone starting out a collection."
4,Insanely good book for abs,"I've been using the exercises in this book for a couple of weeks, and it's crazy how much better I feel already. Granted, it's only been a couple weeks, but these exercises just feel more right than most. The more beginner-style exercises aren't terribly difficult; the critical thing is to keep focused while doing them.My major gripe here is that there aren't enough photos. It's one thing for them to describe the exercise, and quite another to see it. On the other hand, if I'm thinking about what I'm doing, I can figure out what to do.I'll update after I've been using this for a while. For now, though, I do like this book."
1,Bizarre book,"This book has about as much to do with abs as a book on stamp collecting. From the bizarre pictures of a guy doing strange contortionist exercises on the edge of a pool and then in the pool to the useless plyometrics exercises to the ""repulse the monkey"" and ""power slide"" exercises, I found this book utterly useless and, quite frankly, a joke. Don't bother."
1,Extra Cheese,"I bought this CD because this band is from my home town and I've heard good things about them.I hate to have to bash my own city but if these guys are the best Vegas has to offer I don't see much hope for our Rock Scene.This band is no different from most of the other bands you hear on the Nu-Rock stations.It reminds me of 70's bubble gum pop.Sure some of the songs are catchy,but in a David Cassidy sort of way.The singer sounds like he should be working on the Vegas strip as a Cher Impersonator instead of attempting to sing in a rock band.The Drummer is Boring.His style is Rigid,and it lacks soul.The Guitar players riffs are Flat and uncreative. Every song is about a girlfriend,or breaking up with a girlfriend...Nothing special here.It's todays Glam rock, nothing more...Save your cash."
4,"Of several books on PSpice on my shelf, Herniter's is best.","Written as an academic lab manual, it works as well for a small business designer, as I am. It's both a tutorial and reference for PSpice ver 7.1 that's included, but is applicable also to PSpice ver8, especially if you contact the author's Web site for his excellent ver8 support materials. I'm looking forward to Herniter's next edition."
3,Of moderate use,"If you want some basic strategies, information and advice, this is a useful reference. But if you're looking for nitty, gritty, details and technical information on city building and the interation of all the elements of the game, the internet is still the only choice."
3,A Man Betrayed,"This is a point of clarification about this movie and those who are looking for the JOHN WAYNE version of 'A Man Betrayed'. There are two different films called 'A Man Betrayed'. If you're looking for the one with John Wayne, you want the 1941 version. This one - starring Edward J. Nugent and directed by John H. Auer was released in 1936. I have not watched this movie personally but wanted to make sure that you knew the difference."
1,Misled,"I ordered this book because I wanted to get some old John Wayne movies for someone. It comes up under John Wayne movies, however, now that I got it I see no John Wayne referral or info at all. There is a John Wray and it is directed by John Auer, but no John Wayne. Unless he has such a small part he's not even mentioned on the cover?"
5,Liturgy of Hours,"I just purchased the full set of The Liturgy of Hours. If you don't know how ""to pray as we aught"" this is the answer. To think that you are joining millions of others who are praying the Liturgy at the same time. What a powerful prayer. I read the other reviews prior to purchasing the full set. I am so glad I did. If I hadn't been aware that there was a learning curve to reading the Hours I would have been very frustrated and would probably given it up as too hard. It definately does take some insruction to use it. Because of this I bought several books of instruction in the Hours. The very best is ""The Divine Office for Dodos"". What an outstanding book! If you are new to Hours you need to get this book also. Don 't mess with any other book."
3,good but not great,"I use the LOH daily. However I find grail translation idiosyncratic and the american bible unnecessarilydifficult. I keep a copy of the RSV catholic edition handy to read the psalms.For some reason the grail translation does not like the word "" righteous "". Whenever the word righteousshould be used they throw in the word ""just"". Maybe they thought this was easier to chant? or maybe thiswas another way of throwing in the ""social justice"" dogma even when it is inappropriate.On the other hand the LOH has a number of great readings from the bible and the church fathers.The poetry section is especially good. It is a handy way to say your daily prayers.I just wish they would have used a less bizarre translation of the psalms."
4,Liturgy of the Hours,"It was pretty good, the product is in excellent condition, but it came with an outdated guide :("
5,"A Deacon reviews the ""Prayer of the Church""","This four volume set is used by Catholic clergy and lay people throughout the world. It contains Psalms, Old Testament scriptures, New Testament Scriptures, writings of the early Christians, disciples of the Apostles, Church Fathers, Saints and Catholics who lived throughout the 2000 years since the time of Christ. Many Christians other than Catholics use the ""Liturgy of the Hours"" to enhance their spiritual life.I recommend all four volumes whole heartedly."
5,Excellent for daily use,"I'm not an expert on this, but it seemed like this was a very goodedition. Yes, I would recommend it to others."
5,Liturgy of the Hours...,my mother's copies were tattered and torn and when she received these copies she was thrilled...thanks for all involved in helping me find them...
2,"OK, Product but not as good as I expected.",The circles were sprayed on and smugged and the anttenna's would not stand up as protrayed in the picture.
1,never recieved this item,"After several attempts to order this item, and repeated failures of the retailer to deliver it I was forced to cancel the Amazon order and bought a similar product from a local retailer"
2,Better Don`t Expect A Miracle,"We had light colored granite installed in our kitchen earlier this year. Just one day (and already three oil stains) later we realized that those had not been properly sealed by the seller/installer. First I tried a poultice of potato starch and acetone, then the kitchen torch. Both definitely brought a huge improvement. Of course I wanted to get rid of the stains completely, so I purchased this product. Sadly it did not make any further difference. At least it did not make things worse, which was a real fear. Seeing how slowly the solvent evaporates you better have nerves of steel. From reading through the reviews here it seems that the folks having the most success using this product are those with darker counters. We have now sealed our counters with SenGuard. It`s supposedly a one-time application. After three months of heavy duty use I would give SenGuard ten stars. I wish I had done some more research before installing granite."
1,Doesn't work,"After reading all the positive reviews, I had high hopes for this product, but it simply did not work. There are some ring stains on our marble countertops (from dishes, bottles, etc), and I wanted them out. I applied this product to the stains and left it to dry for 60 hours... and nothing. I couldn't believe it, so I reapplied the product to the same area and 58 hours later, still nothing. What a waste! Save your money."
1,stain remover,"I was very hopeful that this product would remove an oil stain from my new granite, but it performed poorly. I ended up using a home remedy of flour and peroxide which worked very well but took 4 applications."
1,Be careful!,"I know this product got great reviews but I had a bad experience. I have a light counter, I think it is called white fantasy. I have a huge oil stain on it and tried Stonetech. Not only did the stain NOT come out but worse yet it literally discolored the granite around the stain. I now have a white ring around my oil stain making it stand out even more. I am very disappointed in this product.Be careful and spot test first!"
5,AWESOME!!!,i am a big fan of r.l. stine fear street sagas. i have been reading the series and i have read 1-10 and am waiting for 11 to come in the library. I got it oder! i have been ordering them for ever now and they are all great! the book is about an evil spirt living in an innocent young girls body! it is a total must read!!!!
1,Not Worth the Money!,"I agree with the last comment. It looks as though some students got together to shoot this. Not professional at all, and you'll learn as much as you would at a hardware store."
4,Good book.,"Most of these ideas will cost you to do, but if you have the budget for it, you will like this book."
5,So good I SOILED myself!!!,"I'm listing to this cd right now and holy speakers batman, I want to start a happy dance right now!!! These songs are so much more fun to play than the ones in method books. My favorite tracks are Faire and Bagtelle. I can't even imagine being able to compose music like this. Andrew York is my friggin' hero!"
1,This book could be harmful to a reader's faith in the Bible.,"I bought this book in our local Catholic Shop which just recently closed its retail business. Today when I read the back cover about the author being the Executive Director of Monastic Interreligious Dialogue, I was concerned that this book might be too modern. I got to page 27 where the Garden of Eden is referred to as myth. I did not like that. Then I paged through the book to see if the book was still worth reading, but saw on page 127 where reference is made to the ""myth of the Archangel Lucifer."" I do not consider the stories in the Bible to be mythology. I will have to throw this book away since it could cause temptation to doubt faith."
4,The Journey of the Inner Life,"This is a book that focuses on the inner journey that we all take with God. The book premise is that thoughts do matter and how we deal with them is important as we proceed in our life's journey. The author offers several ways and techniques to get through negative thoughts, ideas and moods. These have a way of focusing us on self, where the real journey is outward toward the other."
4,sleepy and liquid,"It took me a little longer to get into this cd than ""Watch it happen"" but now it's one of my favorite albums. The title track, What sees the sky and To Keep things moving are a few of the standouts. I find my mood dictated by music sometimes and this one always evokes that warm fuzzy feeling of the end of a deep, satisfying sleep."
2,Same old simple melodies blended with emasculated voice,"It took me about 30 seconds to realize that this album offers really nothing new. Its borrowed blend of soft guitar and angsty voice evokes Belle and Sebastian, Beulah and slow Death Cab for Cutie. I am not against repitition or influence, but it seems that it is most easily excused when flattered by something new. This album certainly doesn't bring anything like that to the table. It should appeal to the angstish, I am different crowd, but if you don't see the irony in the ever increasing movement of ""emo"" music you need to listen more...Buy something else"
5,Rivera Primo Mechanical ignition advance unit,"If you run points or electronic ignition with a mechanical advance, sooner or later you will want to rebuild or replace this unit. The Rivera Primo product ticks the boxes - it is well built - better than the original, it is US built, and the springs are slightly firmer than oem (full advance at 1800-2000 rpm as opposed to oem spec of 1400 rpm) - providing a slightly smoother power up and a slightly snappier power down - which the grey beards will tell you is the best of both worlds."
1,Depressing,"I got this book for my son at a garage sale because his name is Ben and the title sounded promising. This book is horrible. Ben is a lonely boy who asks for a pet and his cruel parents deny him this pleasure as well as giving him no rational explanation as to why he can't have a pet. At one point Ben gets sick and the doctor tells him that he has a bug. Ben, the fatalistic child, proclaims that ""it has come to keep me company.""I will now kill myself.In the end he is allowed to feed a pigeon crumbs on his windowsill and decides that this will suffice. This is a tale of a child with a broken spirit. After I read this to my son I thought ""what is wrong with this author?"" The title page says "" by Anne-Marie Chapouton, Translated by Andrea Mernan."" I get it now, it's French."
1,Mean Parents!,"Ben does his best to ""find"" a friend (pet) despite his parents objections. The book goes through pages and pages of Bens parents rejecting his various requests and compromises for a pet. Ultimately Ben has to be content with feeding the pigeons that land on the ledge of his bedroom window. A no point in the book do Ben's parents give him an explanation for their no pets rule. The book could have been so much better if they had given him a reason: allergies, a landlord who doesn't allow pets, etc. Instead the book presents Ben's parents as heartless and Ben as a very lonely and depressed little boy."
5,Remarkable story of heroism and bravery!,"After reading this book I was surprised to learn that Ramsey had been awarded every medal except the Medal of Honor. Why this honor was not bestowed on this hero is hard to believe. His exploits are almost unbelievable but surely led to MacArthur's return and victory in the Pacific. In view of recent movies about WWII, this would make a great movie. I could hardly put this book down. Great story - well told!"
5,great book,"As a person who has read well over a 100 books on WWII, i have to say this book ranks in my top ten. The story is rich and full of adventurism ... truly a epic tale, and highly recommended. After i was done with this book i had a need to research the life of this man, as i needed to know more ... not to many books leave you with that taste in your mouth."
4,Interesting read,I had the pleasure of meeting Ed Ramsey and his wife Racquel on a cruise last summer. A very interesting gentlemnan. He had many stories to share with us and the rest of our table mates. My take on his book was that it was a way of letting go of the horrors that he and his comrades endured. I would recommend the book to the young that have no memories of this time in our lives as a nation.L. De Bold
5,this is true,"I have seen underground first hand that this is true..KEITH..way to go for wanting people to know what really goes on, even if it is a risk!!"
1,Don't waste your hard earned money!,"I bought the vinyl version of their self-titled debut album Boston in 1976 and thought this group had made one of the best albums of our times. I couldn't stop listening to it. In fact, as soon as the CD version was available, I purchased the collector's version, or Gold CD, and continue to enjoy the music to this day. ""More Than a Feeling"" is a classic and their debut album appears to be impossible to follow with an encore. I thought this group was going to be the next great band and compared to the Rolling Stones and Beatles. Boy, was I wrong! ""Don't Look Back"" was a good album but fell short of their debut and greatest production, ""Boston"". If you haven't purchased ""Boston"" yet, you won't be sorry.My advice to you; purchase the groups first two albums, ""Boston"" and ""Don't Look Back"" and stop right there. The rest of the albums are a waste of time and money."
1,I HATE IT!!!,"Boston's first 2 cds rocked! They were so awesome, they had awesome vocals, awesome drummer, awesome everything. But now they hire new people and change their style and it doesn't sound good at all! If you want a real good Boston cd then buy "" Don't Look Back."" That is their greatest cd. I am a huge Boston fan but I hate this new stuff. I am a fan of the old and better sound of Boston. If you wanna see a good review about Boston, then click on "" Don't Look Back."" I will have a review there."
5,BOSTON IS BACK,"If you are a TRUE fan of Boston you will love this new CD. With a mixture of the Classic sound and the addition of Kimberly Dahme this cd is a winner. I have been a fan of boston from the first album to Corporate America. Tom Scholz has come through once again. This man is a genius. This cd has a musical texture and blend un to it's own. Come on people it is time to step out of the box and embrace this new and refreshing sound of Boston.For those who think Boston is through, tell that to the hundreds of thousands of fans that will be at there concerts next year."
2,Disappointing,"Not sure what went wrong with this album. If you listen to it, you can hear all those great elements that make Boston so great. A female vocalist was added to the band, and actually her voice is amazing. However, I think that there has been too much change to the group, with added members and song writing coming from some of the new members. The production is ok, sound quality etc. I think the bottom line is that the songs, and some of the arrangements, are just not very good. The only song on this album that really sounds like the Boston we all know and love is the first track 'I had a good time'. I was expecting more after waiting all these years for a new album."
5,A Good CD,"Come on, did all of you really expect this cd to sound the same as all Boston's previous releases? If so, why did you even buy it, just go listen to the other 4. While it doesn't sound like all the previous Boston music, that doesn't make it a bad cd. If you like to hear the same old music over and over again, don't buy this cd. If you like talented musicians playing good music (which you must if you're a Boston fan), buy this cd."
1,So...Where's Boston?,"Truth be known and it's imprinted all over this cd...This sounds more like a band who has totally lost its distinct musical identity. This entire recording sounds like a cross between Electric Light Orchestra(ELO)- ZZ TOP - Steve Miller Band circa the late 1970's-early 80's when all of these bands were all over the radio airwaves and charts. Tom Scholz screwed up when he walked away from his original band members years ago - especially BRAD DELP - who he's reinstated here for the obvious. I'd much rather listen to Brad's incredible 1991 cd with his then band RTZ(Return To Zero), which is where the real Boston members wound up, minus Scholz. This is pointless noise."
1,Wacko's serve it up!,"Ah, to go back to 1976 and re-live the first album release again!Sorry to say, what we have here with Corporate America is a cleverly hidden way for the tree huggers and P.E.T.A. crowd to slam their message across to all of us out here that remember the ""Boston"" of old after making us wait eight years. All one has to do is open the c.d. case look on the fold out on the left side and what do we see? Shoot with a camera, not a gun, P.E.T.A., the list goes on.I have yet to hear any of this ""new"" garbage on any major radio station in the L.A. area. Save your money and your time. Grab your old Boston and pretend it's the 70's again.I took my c.d. to the skeet range and nailed it with my Remington 870 at 25 yards. I'll be sending the pieces to a real rocker. Ted Nugent. This effort just plain ""Sucks""."
1,HORRIBLE...simply Horrible!,"I've been a big Boston fan for years. Their first album was one of the first that I ever owned. In spite of missing Brad Delp's vocals, I even enjoyed ""Walk On""....""Corporate America"" ...! It's an uninspired unimaginative mess, something that you wouldn't expect after all of these years. Why can't Tom Scholz ... loosen up and play some Rock? I could go on with a track by track analysis of this mess, but what's the point? It's just not worth the time for me to write and you to read. By all means, stay far away from this ...! Too bad it's not possible to give this a zero or negative rating."
1,I waited 8 years for this?,"The first track is the only song that resembles Boston. In all honesty, these guys should have hung it up after ""Don't Look Back"". The CD is scattered and eclectic, with none of the great guitar and vocal harmonies of old. The pseudo dance beat on one of the songs had me reaching for the remote, if not the eject button. Perhaps a whole CD of Brad Delp's vocals would make it more appealing, or a reunion of the original line up. This CD will eventually end up in the used bin for $.99 and still not sell. How do I know? Mine is already there."
1,Sorry---not the Boston songs of old,"I took a chance and purchased this CD before reading any reviews or listening to any samples. After all this is Boston, and I love all of their music, until now. This CD is absolutely terrible. There are no songs in the spirit of Smokin', Cool the Engines, Long Time, Don't Look Back, or any other Boston favs. I cannot believe how bad this CD turned out, and I am disappointed that Tom and Brad would take our money. Just my opinion, though!"
2,Very weak effort by a legendary band and visionary,"I've been a huge Boston since the late 70's and still know every song on their debut album by heart. But, this entire album is overproduced, schizophrenic, contrived rubbish. There is little coherency in the song writing, the vocals, and the stumbling, not-at-all-clever political commentary. I agree with another reviewer on the topic of why have anyone but Brad Delp sing? He IS the sound of Boston as much as Tom's buzzing Les Pauls through his Rockman/Marshall rig. So he can't nail all the glass-breaking notes anymore - big deal - his voice is pure mercury. Fran lacks the soulful timbre that makes Brad's voice one of the best in rock history. Though, I am sure Tom Scholtz satisfied some artistic vision with this release, it is an album that will be sighed at by Boston fans and laughed at by others. I'll keep my fingers crossed for the next one sometime next decade."
3,"Hated it at first, but then realized its not terrible.","When you expect something close to the the first three records, you initially say to yourself this cd sounds like Jefferson Airplane's song ""We built this city bla bla crap"". I also hear remnants of Queen chorus lines, etc. But after a couple of listenings, Boston can be heard in there somewhere. So its a hit and miss. Some songs are good and some are bad, but I agree with another critic who said there is alot of crap out there, this is above the heap of crap. This cd is light listening for the summer time. If your a Boston fan, skip the political messages and try to just enjoy."
1,Totally Lame!,"I've been a BOSTON fan for 20 years and love their first 4 Albums(Yes I thought Walk On was alright)But, this is just ridiculous. There is only one good song in the LP and that's ""I Had A Good Time"" I actually like the song alot, but that is it. The other songs are as exciting as watching grass grow in the winter. It is so uninspired. Mr. Scholz needs to stick with Brad Delp and go back to their musical roots. That means those killer hard rock guitar riffs, and melodic guitar solos. A couple of years ago a rock station from here in Dallas did a live interview with Tom Scholz. It was a live feed from Dallas to Tom's Hideaway Studio II. During the interview Tom ran his guitar through his ROCKMAN amp and HYPER SPACE PEDAL. Man Tom played some totally awsome stuff. If only he would have lay down those guitar riffs to tape, and used them for this album, it would have made a huge difference."
1,"If I could give it a zero, I would","I loved Boston I. I loved Don't Look Back. I loved Third Stage. (Walk On...eh...) But, listen, Tom...take your tree-hugging liberal crap (and I'm talking about your latest music, not just your political views) and flush it down the drain in your famous basement. This is one of the worst albums I have ever purchased in my 43 years on Earth. If you care so much about Earth, don't put out this kind of crap!"
1,I Had a Good Time...returning this CD,"Tom Sholtz and his Cosmic Cosmo Crew have created what is arguably the cheesiest bunch of ""songs"" on this planet. Chester Cheetah must love this one. Wanna do it again? NO!"
1,Don't waste your ears!,"I love the old Boston. Brad Delp is usually awesome.But... This should not even be called Boston. These are lame songs compared to their first 3 albums. Boston should pay me $14.99 for the 40 minutes of my life I wasted listening to this junk. The music might be decent if it were presented under a different name- but no way does this represent the same band that invented such timeless classics as the first album. They need to hang it up, if this is all they have to offer. Buy some ""RTZ"" instead- at least Barry Goudreau remembers what a ""Rock and Roll"" band is."
1,WORST ALBUM EVER!,"In spite of the fact that I am completely enamored with Tom Scholz's political views and scathing review of ""corporate america,"" I am sorely disappointed in the actual MUSIC. I really wish he had dedicated the rest of his life to the rescue of little furry animals that I confess I like to eat. I sure hope that he is donating all the proceeds from this album to such deserving organizations as Greenpeace, Audabon Society, PETA, Earth Liberation Front, and most notably - the People's Front of Judea! Too bad I can't give this tour de force ZERO STARS... honestly."
2,I didn't think it could happen...,"I've been a huge Boston fan for many years. I have every album they've ever made and eacho of them is a favourite of mine. Then.... I started to get worried when they released their greatest hits album. Two previously unreleased songs contained on that album were junk. I never though it was possible to call a Boston song, even two Boston songs ""junk"". Those two songs had me worried for 5 years about what this new release would be like. In one word, ""garbage"". A new backup/lead volcalist Kimberly Dahme is impressive and I'd love to here her solo, but she's not Boston. Fran Cosmo's son is now in the band and he may or may not have talent but he's definitely not Boston either.I never thought a band that was so good could sink to this level. I would have given this one star except for the fact that they're Boston and Boston's worst is better than most other bands' best efforts."
2,Not what I had in mind,"If you're looking for Boston, they simply aren't here on this CD. It seems as though they lost the ""sound"" they are known for. My recommendation is to pick up the original Boston albums. Even RTZ was so much better. At the very least RTZ captured the sound we all love.Sad to seem them go. Try again guys."
1,Like Enron Boston's Corporate America Goes Bust,"I have heard the new Boston album and was thoroughly disappointed with virtually every song. I am a long time Boston fan and as hard as I tried to like this album, it left me feeling as throw away as Enron's corporate pension plan.This album lacks the same spark and imagination of their previous albums. The new members of the band do not ignite any spark to this album with their contributions. For as long as it takes Tom Scholtz to produce albums I would have thought he would have come up with a much more worthwhile effort than this. It's too bad. I was really hoping for Boston to come back and kick some serious rock and roll butt, but not in this case."
2,corporate america,"I have read a few reviews of the new boston cd and have notice a few of you saying you miss Brad Delps voice. For anyone interested in hearing brad at his best get your hands on a copy of Barry Goudreau's solo album. It was reissued by Razor & Tie in 1996. Brad sings lead on six of the songs and Barry does a fantastic job on guitar. All are great and sound like a Boston release. It was originally release in 1980, it also has Sib Hashian playing drums & percussion. Brad also fronted a band called RTZ from 1991 to 1993 both albums are very respectable, definitly worth the money. Check these three out you will not be dissapointed! As for ""Corporate America"" i do not like the drum programming or the way the vocals seem to get lost in the background. There are some redemable songs here, the reason for the two stars, but just not a strong effort overall."
2,Can't decide if the title is supposed to be irony or not.,"How the mighty have fallen. This is easily Boston's worst album, and Walk On was pretty tough to beat. Middling, mid-tempo rockers with faceless robotic vocals, broken up by a few twee power ballads. Boston has never sounded more generic and dare I say, ""corporate"" in their entire recorded history. If Brad Delp is actually singing on this album, he is so buried in the mix as to be unrecognizable. About the only interesting thing is the addition of a female vocalist, which adds a touch of warmth to this normally testosterone driven band. She is underutilized, but I give Tom Scholz credit for trying something different.If only the overall album hadn't been so uninspired."
1,Umm.....What happened to these guys?,"I'm not sure where the great rock band of the 80's went to but they are no where to be found on this cd. I guess if you're into N*Sync and groups of that ilk you might like this watered down pseudo pop cheese fest. However if you we're expecting anyting even close to their first two cd's, look elsewhere."
2,A couple of good songs...,& some that aren't bad. The one good song is I Had A Good Time. More Delp vocals. Try reaching out to Barry Goudreau as well. Stick to power rock. Get rid of the blonde too. Although very hot... unnecessary... & why the Comso father/son duo thing?
1,Tom's lost ...,"The first two Boston albums were made by a real band with a real drummer and a real bass player. This is the big difference with what Tom's been doing ever since Third Stage. The Boston Sound ( at least to me)is not only the Rockman ! ""No synthesizers used"" used to impress us, but ""no other musicians used"" is a lot less convincing. Use it all, Tom, and think about the words of ""Spirit of radio"" by Rush:""all this machinery making modern music can still be open-hearted, not so coldly charted it's really just a question of your honesty"""
1,Tom needs to retire,"Interesting to note that in the musical world of such a total left-winger like Tommy, all attractive women are addressed as ""mama."" Let's face it folks, this band (or more specifically, Scholz) has been on a linear line downward after, say ""Don't Look Back,"" and ""Korporate Amerika"" is not worth your hard-earned cash. Even a marginal effort like ""Walk On"" would have 2 or 3 tracks of interest. Not this one...time for Tom to hang it up..."
2,Quo vadis Boston,Where are the powerful voices and crying guitars of the recent years?One of the greatest bands of the late 70s on mid class level - it's a shame.After eight years only nine new titles - I guess Tom Scholz ran out of ideas - this is an abuse of the name Boston to make some money. Something like this without the name Boston would probably not have found a producer or label.
1,Wasted Money,"First off I can not even give this album a ""1""Is it just me or does this album sound like Boston has been de-nutted? This album has no balls at all. I did not think they could make an album as bad as Third Stage.....I was wrong!I hope none of the procedes of the [money]I spent on this turkey went to any of the WWW.Web sites that the boys and girl of Boston needed to share with us on the inside cover.This is what happens when you don't eat red meat!I had to go out and buy the new Ted Nugent Album just to get my head back on straight!Sorry Boston and don't try again please!"
3,I really liked some of this.,"Boston's 5th studio album in 26 years ""Corporate America"" #42, is better than I ever thought it would be. The good timey single ""I Had A Good Time"", is a fantastic rocker. I also liked ""Stare Out Your Window"", ""With You"", the first female vocal by Kimberley Dahme. (Almost sounds country). And the 70's vibe of ""You Gave Up On Love"". This is the last Boston album to date. Since this release Brad Delp has died. I just don't see Boston doing anything without Brad. (But I could be wrong)."
4,"a different Boston, but still the Boston sound","With Corporate America, Tom Scholz anti-established himself right of the recording business. He's so anti-corporate that he can't even get his music released anymore. Too bad, because even though he only puts out an album a decade the sound is till there. Corporate America has a mostly new Boston lineup (and the last with Brad Delp RIP) and a fairly different sound than previous releases. But, it still is unmistakably Boston. And that's good thing to me. The new female bass player has some lead vocals which are way outside the Boston norm but the songs are good. The title track is the highlight of the CD. I think most fans of the band will like this album - I do. Get it while you can because I don't see ""corporate america"" pressing any more of these discs!"
3,Totally Different,"If you like classic heart thumping Boston, this is not the album for you. Overall a decent album, it takes you in that different direction that they talk about. There are a couple of songs that will make you feel the old stuff, but basically a mellow album."
2,Dishwater,"A weak and tepid attempt by a once-decent band to reach beyond their short legacy. Instead of sticking with what brought them to the charts, this album takes an abrupt and puzzling left turn. Although some will enjoy this CD, the band should have thought twice, three times, maybe four time before releasing this one. Better yet, let well enough alone."
1,8 years to produce this??,Do not buy this. It is garbage. Brad Delp is not utilized enough and when he is his vocals are not very audible. Tom Scholz is just out to make a buck on this CD. He put forth no effort and just wants to collect his money.
4,"Growing up, older and wiser...still a good listen","For those fans looking for an album that's all 'classic' Boston sound, you won't find it here. Tom even states in the liner notes that he didn't want to do yet another album like that. What you will find is guitar work that is definately Boston mixed with a variety of other influences, which is to be expected 27 years after thier initial release. I think their 1976 debut albums is one of those great albums that somehow remains timeless and I loved both of the follow-ups as well. The sound on this album took a bit of getting used to but if you leave your preconceptions at the door and give the material a chance to stand on it's own, I think you'll enjoy it. Change and growth is a good thing...it's natural....and yes, I'm old enough to have been a big fan of theirs since the beginning."
4,21st Century Boston,"The current Boston team is keeping current with issues that matter, and writing quality music to back it up. If you liked Boston from the beginning, this will be a treat. Incidentally, I'm from Massachusetts, so admittedly, there is a cultural bias here."
1,"Try it ,you might like it","Contrary to alot of reviews i'm seeing online, i have to say that this recording is growing on me. Anyone who is a true Boston fan and has had their bowels shaken by that seismic live organ sound should find this collection of tunes enjoyable. I think this is a very transitional time for Scholz and his present crew. They are exploring some different avenues of expression and I say more power to them. There are a couple of moments here that leave one bewildered,like The title track....that disco pulsing rhythm has got to go Tom! And the ""stare out your window tune"" is like a blatant oasis rip off. My favs are (of course) the songs Brad delp sings . The ballad Kimberly sings is a beautiful song and i think her inclusion into the band is a bold and intersting move.And for all her detractors.. that song aint country. Its just a great song.I cant wait to hear what they do next.The main thing is..Boston lives on...All hail tom Scholz!!!"
2,disappointing,Well yes I have to admit this CD is mediocre even for a fan.Why 3 singers? Why is one of them a female country singer?There are only 2-3 really Bostonish good songs here.Couldn't you give the fans a little more than 10+1 old song live version?If this is your first Boston CD please check out Walk On that's real music.
3,"Interesting and diverse, but.......","There is definitely some excellent song writing on here, and 1 or 2 songs get me going. But there are several things not right. First, there are too many different kinds of music and they conflict with each other, the album just doesn't flow. It goes from rock to pop to country. With You by the new Kimberly is very good but it just doesn't belong on this CD. The album is way over produced also, too much extra crap thrown into the songs, sound effects that are annoying and are not music. As someone else mentioned, it's a great CD to listen to while folding your laundry, that's about it.I don't understand the whole Corporate America theme also, the song is not that good and it's hard to hear what the vocalists are saying. If you want an album that effectively conveys a message about corporate america and contains good rock music, then go with Tom Petty's The Last DJ. He did what Tom Sholtz tried to do here, only about 10X better."
3,Disappointing release,"Overall, Corporate America is not up to what I've come to expect from Boston. I think Walk On is one of their best releases (in spite of who is NOT singing--get over it people), and was expecting more of the same, if not better. Not even a extended instrumental on this one. It is interesting to hear a female vocal on a Boston album--she's quite competent but it will take some time to get used to. Boston fans will definitely want to get this one, but don't set your expectations too high. After seven years, they could have done better. I'm hoping it will grow on me with more playings."
1,Corporate America Flops,"First of all, I am a huge Boston fan, but this album does not do justice. I am extremely dissapointed with the songs. I think the mix sounds muddy and the drums sound fake ( a common complaint for all Boston albums since Third Stage). The fact is Boston is as much Brad Delp's vocal harmonies as it is Tom Scholz' guitar and song writing. Unfortunately, there isn't enough of either on this album. Finally, why are all the environmental wacko comments on the inside cover of the liner notes? Could it be because some people wouldn't buy it if they were on the outside?This album is destined to be found in quantity on e-bay and at your local used CD store. Cheap!"
1,I hate this CD!,"Not one listenable track on here. The entire album is one big flop. Get one of their older albums if you want to hear Boston at its best, not this political propganda nonsense."
1,Not Very Good,"This is by far the worst of the Boston albums. Ironically, it's also the most expensive. That's because it's so bad very few were sold. At least Walk On had a few good rocking tunes on it. This thing is all lightweight trash. The song With You is not even Boston. It's some gal singing along with a guitar and it can't even be classified as rock. If you like Boston a lot then go ahead and buy this, but just be warned it's not even close to the first two albums and far weaker than Walk On, which wasn't that great either."
2,"Good music, jarringly bad lyrics","I got this album used on a whim, just to see what they'd done. The music is mostly solid - great crunching guitars, power chords, harmonies, etc. Some of the songs are just not Boston, though - I normally salute expanding one's boundaries, but some of the songs just don't make sense to me. And the lyrics, good god, the lyrics. It's really hard to listen to them - they're so bad. Political rants mixed with the cheesiest vapid lovey dovey lyrics this side of Frampton. It's nice as a brief reminder of how great Boston used to be, and inspiration to put that on instead."
2,From Boston to Nashville,"To steal part of a tired phrase, this is not your father's Boston. Tired is also how many geezer rock Boston fans like me will feel after about the first 3 cuts. The CD starts off promising with the first track - I Had A Good Time. Brad Delp's vocals are as strong as ever here and on the title cut, then he is relegated to bench backup duties on practically the rest of the CD. Fans yearning for the sophisticated, ableit packaged Boston sound of yesteryear will continue to hunger. Clearly, Tom Sholz is influenced by the folksy sound and stylings of newcomer Kimberley Dahme, a good talent,but a CD over-produced in this direction. The result is a hodgepodge of ballads and political message tunes with an odd country, discorock and daresay hint of folk, topped off with a sprinkling of Boston purist driving harmony guitars added as an afterthought. Buy it used and be prepared to put in under the tree this year for that Secret Santa who doesn't mind ""music that grows on you""."
2,Corporate America Dissapoints!,"Tracks 1 and 5 are the only ones I cared for, the group instead of rocking with a CD that you can typically listen to every song bombed on this one. They change lead singers every other song, styles change throughout the CD. Also the lyrics do not match the music well and flow like most boston CD's do.Gave this one a VERY LOW REVIEW 2 stars for only 2 ""decent"" tracks on the entire CD. The remake of the ""living for you track is even bad!""Boston Corporate America = *Sigh* I think I wasted my money on this one."
2,Hi I'm Tom Scholz and I am out of ideas.....,"First let me state that Boston is one of the greatest rock groups ever. While I am a big fan, Tom Scholz should realize when one is out of ideas to quit while one is ahead. Fran Cosmo is acclaimed to be a great vocalist by Tom, but I find his vocals to be subpar. He whispers his singing and the CD is mixed by amplifying until it sounds more like Brad Delp (Hello...use Brad Delp...one of the greatest singers ever)Instead Brad is delegated to backup and harmony vocals (what a waste....). The CD is produced very well, but there aren't many of the trademark Boston hooks from previous works.I gave it two stars, but I'm being very kind. If you're looking for Boston, don't waste your time and go listen to previous releases."
1,Very Disappointing!,"As great a musician Tom Sholz is; I don't understand why he made a CD like this. Why can't he use a ""full band"" on the entire album? I think there are only 2 tracks that use a ""Real"" Drummer! Why no Bass player? Why all the Goofy ""photographs""??"
3,ODD MIX,"""I Had A Good Time"" is a good track. The rest of the first few songs are marginal at best, and ""With You"" just does not belong.The second half of the CD is the best. More like the BOSTON I personally like. The live cut of ""Livin' For You"" (originally on the ""Walk On"" CD) is a killer live tune. Overall, a good CD, but BOSTON should have done better. Kick out three or four of the first five songs and replace them with better material and this would have gotten four or five stars. Go for it if you are a BOSTON fan, but be wary of the mix of songs. Excellent production values as customary from Mr. Scholz and the cover art (front, back, and disc) is exceptional, also indicative of BOSTON releases. Don't wait so long for another release guys, but you can definitely do better on the track selection.How about a ""live"" CD, or even better, a live DVD? Based upon the ""Livin' For You"" track, it should be awesome.Best Wishes!"
4,Some awesome music here; albeit different.,"The song ""Someone"" is so good that it alone makes this CD worthy of a purchase. I think the band artistically did very well here.""You had a good time"" is a great way to start the CD. It is a rocking hit hit hit!!! ""With You"" with female vocalist does seem out of place on a Boston CD but the song is a good one, especially after several listens. Overall, the more you listen to this CD, the more you like it.""Someone"" should be a number 1 song if it sees airplay, which I doubt it will since Corporate America has ruined radio, and I don't mean this CD."
1,Like Enron Boston's Corporate America Goes Bust,"I have heard the new Boston album and was thoroughly disappointed with virtually every song. I am a long time Boston fan and as hard as I tried to like this album, it left me feeling as throw away as Enron's corporate pension plan.This album lacks the same spark and imagination of their previous albums. The new members of the band do not ignite any spark to this album with their contributions. For as long as it takes Tom Scholtz to produce albums I would have thought he would have come up with a much more worthwhile effort than this. It's too bad. I was really hoping for Boston to come back and kick some serious rock and roll [butt], but not in this case."
2,GET RID OF THE PROGRAMMED DRUMS!!!,"Having just read some of the other reviews, I am stumped. Are we hearing the same things? I have been a Boston fan for years, but this CD just doesn't cut it for me. With a couple of exceptions, every song contains electronic (or programmed) drums. Nothing kills a groove like a drum machine. Also, the songs don't seem to be on the same par as previous efforts. I gave this CD a close, fair hearing, and then I put on their 70's debut. NIGHT AND DAY. To me, this sounds like a demo tape done on a four track recorder. No offense to Tom, but WHAT HAPPENED?"
2,Where is Boston?,"I still get chills listening to Boston's earlier stuff - This CD produces very few chills. Brad Delp is virtually unheard on this CD - even on the songs he sings he can barely be heard. The other singers appear to be doing a Brad Delp inpersonation. There is just enough Boston sound on this CD to make you want to hear more, but unfortunately, at the end of the CD, your are woefully unsatisfied. This is not a Boston CD. Tom, change the name of the band so others wont get suckered into buying this CD."
2,Goodbye Boston,"At least Boston is consistent... consistently going downhill. Is it living in the past to say that Boston peaked in 1976 with their masterful debut album? Sure, there are always going to be people who argue that bands have a right to move forward as they see fit. Fine. But how is Corporate America in ANY sense moving forward? Boston was popular in the 70's and 80's because they carved out a musical niche for themselves, and then wrote and performed music better than anyone else in that niche. Now, with Corporate America, they try to carve out new niches for themselves (alternative and country?!) and fall flat on their faces. I would have no problem with Boston updating their sound and making musical progress. After all, quality is quality. This, on the other hand, is a desperate (and failed) attempt to stay current. Rest in peace, Boston. You were a great band in your heyday."
1,What the ...,"Save your money!!! If you really must hear this kind of garbage, find a teen ager and borrow their N'Sync CD! I can't believe they even released this with the name Boston on it! It vaguely reminds you of ""old Boston"" but with a Backstreet Boys beat and feel to it.Long story short... avoid this one!"
1,Tells you about corp america...stinkola,This album was released in 2002 and from the first track down to the last...stunk.This piece of junk should be used as target practice{even that would be wasting a bullet}This heap of junk sounds like it was mixed in a crawlspace somewhere in the pit of New York.I had a good time was painfull as hell.YUCK! I love Boston I wish they would make another one like Third Stages..At least that was traditional Boston.You guys are great...but Corp America.....ass wipe!
1,Minus 1 star. What happened to boston?-they suck now.,"Well,when you come down to it now,Boston is only Tom Scholz.Brad is longer with us,[Rip]and the rest of the oringinal lineup is missing.dont get me wrong,I loved Boston's first two albums...you cannot get any better than those...but nowadays Boston sucks.for me Boston died when Tom released Third Stage.maybe he waited to long between albums to release another one? thats my feelings on the matter.third stage was okay but really not enough to make me keep the disc.I traded it for something else I think.first two albums are keepers though and my opinion,if you want see Boston in all their glory then,check out the first two albums and the rest,I wouldn't even give 50 cents for...."
4,Very Good Album and A Great Tribute To Brad Delp,"I just picked up this album following the very sad news that Brad Delp committed suicide. Ironically, the song, ""I Had A Really Good Time"" sounds like a farewell to his fans four years before his untimely passing. I think ""Stare Out Your Window"" and ""I Didn't Mean To Fall In Love"" are very good. The rest of the songs are good. I do think Fran Cosmo is a welcome addition to the band. It is a crying shame that Boston is no more. Brad Delp, Tom Scholz and Barry Goudreau were reportedly going to go on tour for a reunion this summer. Now that will never happen. RIP Brad Delp."
2,Not what I expected,I was anticipating another rocking album with lots of great guitar work. Unfortunatly that is not what I got. There was too much acoustic guitar for me. It sounded more like a generic boy band than a refined rock band.
4,A Welcome Return!!!,"The yet again long wait for a Boston release has arrived. The newest cd by the seventies rock legends ""Corporate America"" is a well balanced disc.The first track ""I Had A Good Time"" with the very recognizable sound of Tom Scholz's guitar and original vocalists Brad Delp vocals takes me back to 1976 again. It's a very rocking song.I also liked the title track ""Corporate America"" a mix of the old and new sound with Delp and Fran Cosmo of the ""Walk On"" release sharing the vocal duties. I like the message of the song and it also one of the many rocking tunes on the cd.I like the addition of third vocalist Kimberly Dahme who does an acoustic track ""With You"" and also does vocals on ""You Gave Up On Love"". Both are very mellow tracks but I liked them both.Give these veteran rockers a listen, it was well worth the wait!"
4,5 albums in 27 years!,"why o why does tom scholz have to spend so long making each boston album.the instantly recognisable multi-layered guitars are back as are the impeccable production values that boston aside in their field.this album is more akin to third stage than their debut and as such it is more reflective than walk on which got a little bit too close to heavy for heavys sake at times.welcome back boston,but please dont leave it so long next time."
3,Let's Hope the Tour is Decent - This CD is average.,"I'm a huge Boston Fan, and wanted this new effort to be everthing 110 yrs in the making should have made it. ... Some of the Boston trademarks are here, but the sounds quality is not up to today's current digital standards. New Kid Anthony Cosmo shows signs of becoming a good writer. Gary Pihl only plays on the ""Live"" version of ""Living for You"", why is that? The song Corporate America has some meaning, but where are the hard driving party songs Boston is know for? Maybe one or two of these songs is good enough to be on ""Third Stage"". I expect this CD will be bought only from DIEHARD Boston FANS. No Hit Singles, doubtful if it goes platinum... Maybe they can do a LIVE in Concert DVD, play alot of old songs, let BRAD sing most of them, and reward all of the old fans. ..."
3,Not a bad bunch of songs but....,"WHY does Brad Delp get the shaft by singing only 3 songs? I dont want to hear Kimberly Dahme, I definitely dont want to hear a deadly concoction of acoustic songs from thefather-son ""Cosmo"" team. Im being a little too hard; Im just biast. Brad Delp is a great singer, dont substitute his tremendous talent for a bunch of so-so vocalists."
2,It Was Free,I signed up to win this CD on a radio stations website. I won't own it if I hadn't won it.
2,Corporate Bomb,Whatever happened to the real Boston? This used to be my favorite group but Im not sure what Tom Scholz is currently thinking or where his music is going. The only high point to this CD is some of the guitar licks. Please oh please when will the real Boston come back??
4,It's Still Boston,I agree this is not the best album that Boston has ever put out. But how can you beat the original. It's practicly impossible. I would give this album 5 stars if it was not for the one or two really slow and not so boston songs. Other than that the album rocks.
3,Boston of now,"I was excited to hear of the release of another cd by one of, if not the best, rock bands ever. The disapointment set in on track #4. Boston does not need a female singer, talk about Corporate America. The rest of the tracks are ok with tracks 1,3 and 9 being the best. This album is alright but not all I expected.See you in another nine years boys."
1,Had to clean my ears out first,"Ok, this has to be a mistake. I thought I was reviewing a BOSTON CD. I just cannot believe what I am hearing. This might be the worst album I have ever heard since that Desmond Child crap from the 90's. But what do I know, looks like INXS is trying to do the same thing, find a chick lead singer and re-invent themselves.WOW,"
1,Horrible,"This is the worst music I have ever heard.The band use to be great, The first two albums were alsome,third stage was good, walk on was ok, this one is pure crap.Don`t waste your money on this band, they have forgot what rock is about."
2,what gives?,"Am I listening to boston here? Half the album sounds pretty good but the rest is [weak]. 8 years between cds and they can't even come up with enough material to fill an entire cd? what's the deal with the live song? Also the push for vegetarianism is a bit much. I mean come on, how many rock fans out there are going to put down their beer and brats and pick up some tofu(not that it [is bad] it just can't replace the real thing)? Not me. This band will drift into oblivion if they continue to put out cds like this."
1,(EIGHT) years for THIS ? ? ?,"What a sorry effort this is. Production quality is weak. Drum tracks are off beat and sound like ..., vocals are weak.For BOSTON fans everywhere, if you wish to stay a fan, DO NOT buy this CD. However, if you must buy it, compared to their past works, you'll lose interest quick.What a shame to see such a great band just go down the tubes.Also, all the enviromental and PETA ...that's in the liner is not what the fans are interested in. It's the Music!!!!Just wish it would've been included in this CD."
1,How could you let us down Tom?,"I have been a die-hard Boston Fan since the early days. I always waited for each new album with great anticipation. I buy them without any reservation and pick out the right time to debut and savor the newest Boston creation. This was the biggest disappointment I have ever had in an album purchase. I would gladly pay someone a dollar to take this thing off my hands if they paid the shipping. I would gladly volunteer to get a root canal than to further taint my fond memory of this once respectable band by listening to this new album twice. The political literature about PETA, anti-meat, and anti-gun propaganda is insulting. Entertain us Tom, even wow us, but don't tell us what to think or how to live. That is not your role!"
1,Boston? Bawston? Not!,"Tom Scholtz needs to go back to the drawing board. Looks like we need 10 years in between releases here.. Only two tunes sound like Boston. ""I had a good time"" and ""Corporate America""- the rest is Gahbage... I also can't believe there's now a female in the band... I was disappointed BIG TIME! And I'm from Boston!"
1,Give me a break,"I've been a Boston fan since the mid 70's. I don't recognize the sound on this album AT ALL except for some of Tom's guitar style. Hey, you may like this or you may not, but it is NOT Boston. It really irritates me that they would serve up this stuff under the name of a band that started almost 30 years ago as a ROCK band. This sounds like some kind of alternative/new age thing. Again, if you are into it, great. If this is where Tom and Brad are at these days, good for them. Pick another name for the band/project and get after it. I wish you the best. But again, this has nothing to do with the Boston that I grew up listening to and it is a complete rip off to market this as a Boston album. George Lynch tried to market a rap album as Lynch Mob a few years ago. Whats next? Maybe Sting will record some Gregorian chants and call it a new Police album. This kind of marketing BS STINKS! Keep your money and keep listening to the first 3 Boston albums."
1,NOT BOSTON OF OLD!,"Please don't waste your money. This not the Boston of old. They have been replaced by a bunch of tree hugging wanna be song writers. The only good song is an oldie. I was sadly disappointed. Take my advice, and save the money for something more worthy. Really sad Boston, was expecting much greater things from a once great band."
4,Boston Still Kicks Out The Jams!,"After the long dry spell of no Boston, I listened to this CD six times trying to find a reason not to like it. I found none. Boston is the band that the one-hit wonder bands of the 80s-90's wish they could be: Still producing an incredibly powerful and unique brand of music after three decades.Any real fan of Boston will enjoy this CD thoroughly. It combines the perfect fusion of their classic melody with a bit of modern experimentation. Not every cut fits neatly into the 'Boston sound' but that's the genius behind this CD. Scholtz & Co. have delivered a fresh sound while staying true to the band's roots.For those who compare every recording on the planet to Boston's debut album and can't stand the slightest deviation, you won't like every song. For those who don't mind a bit of experimentation this CD is every bit as good as any Boston production.What was true about this band in 1976 is still true today: ""Listen to the record."""
1,Laughable!,"Ha ha, this album is hilarious. Doesn't sound anything like Boston's early, glory days. It's a mixture of really bad songwriting and singing. Some of it sounds like it's band that's a male version of Abba, with them told to really embarass themselves. Then there's the song ""Turn it Off"", which is angrier and heavier, but still sums up how the listener should approach this ""album"".Lame, foolish, syrupy, lite-rock in the poorest way. Sorry folks, this is bottom of the barrel stuff..."
1,Do Not Purchase,"This is CD is as bad as the 1994 release of Walk On. This CD is awful. For anyone who is a long time Boston fan, you will be disappointed in this CD. I cannot believe this took 7 years to produce."
1,"New title: Don't look, Crap!","If they played this cd on death row, prisoners would bypass the appeals process just to avoid listening to it one more time. All the magic of the first three albums--gone. In this case, live in the past."
1,again I wonder why in the digital age a cd will cost 50 dollars,why oh why are the record companies doing this. There is no reason a cd should cost 50 dollars. Its digital..storage is nothing...reproducing is what a dollar...
3,Not what I expected.,"Ordered this hoping it was similar to other Boston albums. This one has a whole different style, not hard-rockin' like the earlier releases. As for the seller and the transaction, was perfect."
3,this cost how much,this cd is different it almost like they had stuff left over from third stage and some new stuff that kinda sucks.cant believe they put their name on this much less released it. Of coures nobody ever heard of it and they pust there tree hugging agend in the packageing.
5,"Gospel according to Moses, The: What My Jewish Friends Taught Me about Jesus",This book was recommended to me by a Presbytarian Pastor in New Zealand who rated it as one of the best books he had read on the subject of Hebraic thinking.I agree 100% with his thoughts ... and have since purchased 5 of these books for friends... and a close friend in Israel has downloaded via Kindle to her Ipad.A must read to understand the thinking of those that wrote 'Our Bible'.
5,Profoundly insightful,"I couldn't put this book down. I read it at the perfect time for me. I've studied and taught the Bible for decades from a Christian viewpoint, but I've always been drawn to the connection between Judaism and Christianity. This curiosity has led me to spend more and more time in the Old Testament, or Tanach. This book is the account of another Christian Bible student with a similar attraction to Jewish thought; however, Dickson went directly to the source and attended regular study sessions at a local synagogue. Through this book I have been stretched intellectually and spiritually in ways that are brand new to me. My resolve to learn more on these subjects is stronger than ever. I've even signed up for Hebrew lessons at a local synagogue. I am excited about the possibilities of future spiritual growth as I dig deeper into the Scriptures revered by Jesus and his disciples."
4,a good series,This was an enjoyable book in the series and I would recommend it to someone else. Nothing special but an easy read.
4,good read,"I bought this book for my 10 year old. Not one of her very favorites, but she did enjoy it."
4,Absolutely fascinating!!!,"I loved the history and details in this book, i enjoy her writing and have no trouble losing myself in her books. the trouble comes with trying to put them down!"
4,good read,"Jack takes medicine to help his heart, or so he thinks. Instead he finds out rather unexpectantly that the medicine represses the warrior stone in his chest and he is now a chess piece in a game he never intended to play.This book is filled with what is now the norm cliché for YA books. Unknown hero in small town suddenly has powers- his nerdy friend and sporty friend cannot be told the truth, but his ex-girlfriend tries to sell him to the highest bidder and his new love interest is not everything she pretends to be. That being said, this book was published in 2007- meaning it was written before that and a lot of what is overdone now was not then. Additionally This story had tons of people to keep track of and some such as Linda came and went quite easily in the story."
4,Spectacularly Written YA Story,"I thoroughly enjoyed this YA book--from the beginning, the narrators are relateable and engaging, and I was hooked by the end of the first chapter. Chima's story of a small-town boy whose life is unexpectedly interrupted by magic is engrossing, and the rest of the book flows well as Jack not only comes to terms with his magical abilities and the dangers that he faces, but also with the realization that trust can't be given lightly and people often have more reasons and motivations than are first obvious. The story is well written and wraps up the loose ends and majority of questions introduced early on, while leaving an obvious door for the next book in the series. Perhaps the only criticism is that the end is too predictable--that being said, I still enjoyed reading through to the last page, and would definitely suggest this book for anyone who's a fan of fantasy."
5,Brilliant,"I loved this book so much. I have read it several times and even suggested it to my teacher to read to my class. I got many of my friends to start reading it and they loved and got their friends started on it. Overall, Cinda did an amzing job on this book and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone."
3,Fun book,"Please stop complaining that this isn't as good as others of this ilk. It stands on its own merits as fun and exciting and a nice escape. My 13 year old nephew, with whom I enjoy sharing books, recommended this and loves the series. He is an avid reader and loves adventures with wizards, dragons etc. It also kept me interested from the start. Enjoy this series"
4,The Warrior Heir,"The begining is really boring but once you get past it, it becomes really exciting. Could not put it down."
4,Good Book,"Part of a three volume series: I have read the first two (The Warrior Heir and The Wizard Hier) and have pre-ordered the paper-back edition of the third (The Dragon Heir).I quite enjoyed the first, as the interest and action kept did not fade after the beginning, as occurs in many books.The second was a bit more limited in scope and character interest, but good enough that I am awaiting the third with anticipated pleasure."
5,An Adventure...,"This book is filled with adventure, love and romance, Battles, and all the things that normally go with a fictional book.It takes place now in mondern times, it tells of a boy who was ment to be a wizard but was made a warrior. There are people trying to kill and kidnapp him.al in all it is a tremendously awesome book"
3,"Not gripping, but not boring","The Warrior Heir is your typical fantasy book. A young man finds out he's special. I don't want to make it sound like it was lame, it wasn't. I would give it... 3.5 stars.This book had romance, good conquers evil, and adventure. It didn't ""hold me on the edge of my seat"" but it didn't put me to sleep either."
4,The Warrior Heir,"Great book for teenagers and adults. It moves along a little slow with some great action, but well worth the read!"
2,i was SO intrested but it failed to carry,it would have been great if it wasnt set in modern time and warriors werent such and endangered species. and if jack trained with a rose and had boundry fights with the rival rose. and was more likeable. sorry for ranting but when i picked up this book thats what i thought it would be.
3,Just Fine,"People are all over the place on this series and I can understand why. The characters are serviceable, the plot is pretty ordinary and the writing is reasonably strong. A lot of it is predictable, and some of the details just come in out of nowhere. However, there are some nice creative touches, and there is nothing particularly offensive or annoying that crops up. So, it just sort of ""is"" and would be a just fine choice if options were limited.I read this first volume, but have not sought out the other two. It seems that this would be a good choice for a reader to try, and if the characters click, then one could go on to the rest. If not, well, this volume is just fine."
3,Dreamer design stroller infant insert,"Good quality, made well. However, we were disappointed with the product. It did not give our infant twins the full body support they needed, especially at the neck & head. We still used receiving blankets on the sides and under their bottoms for the extra support. We were hoping to not need the extra receiving blankets anymore and just use the inserts, were definately expecting something better."
4,Good product for the baby jogger,My son is still too young to really use his baby jogger for jogging. So I bought this infant seat to use to push him around the neighborhood. He loves being able to look out at the world.
3,Head still rolls,"This product is well-made, but my daughter's head still doesn't stay supported when she naps. I am thinking it may work better when she is older and bigger and sits in a front-facing carseat."
2,re-occuring theme,they were cute enough when I got them. great for casual wear with jeans. they broke in a little over a week. seems to be the re-occuring theme with anything from silverspeck. I have begun avoiding any jewelry they sell on here.
2,The first movie was almost as bad as the second,"I actually purchased it to see the rape scenes that were mentioned in the reviews that I had read about it. Well, I've seen better and the ones in this dvd don't ever come close. One star for each movie which makes a total of two."
3,Malibu High/Trip With Teacher,"After viewing both of these movies I feel that they could have been better. 'Trip With Teacher' was a better movie than 'Malibu High' possibly because I enjoyed it more. At any rate, they were both about what I expected them to be."
1,Low budget,"both movies on this disk are rubbish. Poor quality transfer, poor quality sound, poor quality acting, script, etc."
4,"Pretty good, and I keep getting it","I've had three versions of this watch in the past three years. I like the style and the colors a lot. The water resistance is great, and the display is a good size and not too cluttered. The only problem I've had is that the strap tends to break every year, but since it's not that expensive, I've just been replacing it with the same style every time."
4,Great Watch with Reasonable price,Great watch with reasonable price. The watch was a little small for me but ok for my children. They love it.
4,cool watch,"this is a really cool watch. it is hard to program, but works really well.it is really good looking. i got one last christmas and it still works"
2,Band broke first wearing!,Band broke with first wearing; almost impossible to set-instructions that came with watch didn't correspond to the watch. I'm sending back ASAP-can't bellieve this watch was rated so highly!
2,blue face plate falls off,"I bought this watch last year and the blue decorative face plate falls off in time. It also happened on a different Timex watch I bought at the same time. The watch still functions, but doesn't look too cool anymore."
2,Below Satisfactory,"The watch is quite lightweight and comes with good features. However, I think it is very hard to use. You have to hit the buttons just right and for the certain amount of times to change anything. If you lose the directions, you will never remember how to change it. It took me over 6 months to change it. I had many people try to alter it, but it was to no prevail. Additionally, the watch is not very water resistant. I went swimming a couple of times and now I hardly see the time due to the water.I would recommend paying more for a lot better watch. For this was a waste of money!"
3,"Good watch, bad wrist band.",The wrist band is the only thing I don't like from Timex watches. It is easy to damage and difficult to find a replacement that is always expensive
4,A great and fun golf game!,"Wailae golf for N64 is the only golf game on N64 and I think it is great! The graphics are ok, but once you get beyond that you will see that it is very fun. If you have friends then have them play with you because multiplaying on this game is the best! If your a golf fan, get this game or do what I will do and wait for mario golf."
3,"""Borrowed"" from original author","Both books the Legend of Three Trees and the Tale of Three Trees are a ""plagierized"" versions of the ORIGINAL story written back in the 1950's by Helen Frazee Bower. It is called God's Trees and is in a book of children's stories. It was written for her grandchildren. That is ME!!! It is so sad to see all the ""stolen"" versions out there today that give her no credit!!! But at least her story and the great message behind it are all over the world."
3,"Great book, but came damaged","Wonderful story, kids loved it. The book did not arrive as described. It worked for what I needed though, so we are keeping it."
1,Parents Beware: Don't Be Fooled,"This book starts out as a seemingly benign book about how trees grow, but quickly devolves into their use in ancient torture devices. Inappropriate for children!"
4,scary,"I like how you can keep picking an ending. It's scary but not too scary. My little brothers think it's very scary. I started reading this book in grade one because the teacher had it in her room, then my Granny bought it for me so I could finish it. Now I'm in grade four. A long time to remember a book isn't it though?"
2,Not a good piece of literature,"I got this book from a friend because he knew I liked to read and thought I would enjoy it. I found it was poorly written and unbelievable. It's fun to choose your story and make your own decisions, but it gets old after a while. The first time you read it you might like it, but it gets less fun every time you read it again. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone over 10 years old."
4,Great reminded of youth group songs in the 90's,"This album contains a collection of songs intended to be used in youth groups back in the Nineties. Amy Grant used a variety of Christian Artists, Michael W. Smith, Susan Ashton, Wes King and others. The songs are quaint but bring back the simplicity of simple songs sung to the Lord. The only people who will appreciate this are those who experienced these songs in their youth ministries."
4,Nice product but more involved to install than advertised,"Westinghouse has made a great little remote here that works as promised. However the description on their own web site neglects to mention the need to install an electronic module inside the fan. They also don't state which fan models (In their own Line) this module will not fit. We bought a Ceiling hugger model and there was no room indide the fan for the module, it had to be located in the junction box above the fan. So while the fan control works great and as described there might be a bit of work involved wiring and installing the communications module."
1,Sensor too big for Westinghouse fan,"I purchased two of these remotes to go with two recently purchased Westinghouse fans thinking they would be easily compatible, not the case. In both cases the sensor was too big to fit in the housing unit of the fan and I was unable to use them. The directions alternate installation suggestion of on top the motor housing doesn't even seem feasible since you would then have wires exposed, not a very classy look. I am working on returning mine for a refund."
3,Ceiling fan and light remote control,Good product. Only it did not install like the pictures said it would.The fan I bought this to go with was a small ceiling fan for a small room.The remote pack would not fit in the fan as the directions state. I hadto come up with another solution. Was kind of a pain! IF you order thismake sure that it will fint in the fan.
5,Works Great,I already had a unit inside the fan and purchased this hoping it would work. I put in the batteries clicked the light button and bam! the light came on. I held the button down and it dimmed. Worked great. Pushed the speed buttons and that worked too!
3,I thought the book ..,may have had a later publishing date than 1970. I should have checked if it was updated in the 90's or later before I bought it. It is 40 years old now.
3,It Was... Alright..,"I was expecting a more in depth history of how they met and how they got started. It mentions it sure, but doesn't really expand more on ""we met in such and such town and started pickin"".It does have alot of good music and interesting archival videos [which i wish there were more], but as a documentary it doesn't really hit the nail on the head like it should. It's an alright buy for someone who really likes the New Lost City Ramblers I think, but even for those fans it's not worth 22 dollars."
4,"Nobody Listens and Meanwhile, Women Die","Childbed fever killed women in enormous numbers before the significance of bacteria in the travel of illness was discovered. This book discusses the work of one physician to solve the mystery of puerperal fever, and why it was that hundreds of women would die if they went into one ward of a specific hospital, but only a few would die in the other ward.Sometimes the language used is a bit too clinical for the average reader, but the puzzle being assembled is a fascinating one. How Dr. Semmelweis was able to connect the dots using such rudimentary evidence is nothing short of genius. Sadly, the doctor's own behavior and attitude caused him to be largely ignored. It wasn't until many years later when the calm, methodical Dr. Lister came along, that things finally began to change. It's an interesting, infuriating and investigative story - one that is well written and well worth the reader's time."
4,A very good read,"Starts with a bang, and then presents an almost-classic illustration of the daunting challenge faced by scientific data when it threatens long-standing tradition.The Doctors' Plague: Germs, Childbed Fever, and the Strange Story of Ignac Semmelweis (Great Discoveries)"
4,Good Color for warm skin tones,"I like this color , it looks good and it's not brassy , I have it on automatic order now."
1,didn't do anything,"I tried using Garnier Haircolor #80, Butternut, on my light brown hair and it did not work at all. My hair color didn't change after using the dye. I guess I'm glad it didn't turn orange or bright yellow, but it also was a waste of $8 and an hour."
4,excellent product but can be inconsistent,"I've purchased Cleartone coated strings several times. After being totally delighted with a few sets that lasted for a long time I got one that I considered not up to the level as the others. I went back to Elixirs which never showed me any inconsistency. If you haven't tried Cleartones however and you want to experience the best, give them a try. They are more expensive than Elixirs but in a life time, they are worth the few extra dollars to find out if they do something special for you."
3,The Proof is on My Fingers,"Whenever I played with traditional strings, my fingertips would turn green. This was because bare metal would react with the salt and sweat from my fingers and oxidize (similar to the Statue of Liberty). This corrosion causes the strings to become duller and worn out. The defining feature of this product is the coating which is meant to prevent moisture from causing this reaction. Therefore, your strings last longer. Traditionally, the coating has reduced the sound quality of guitar strings. However, this product is wonderful! For the first 3 days the strings sound strange. But after they stretch out a little, they sound perfectly fine. My fingers have stopped turning green; proof that the product works! I must warn you that it only extends the life of the strings by 2 maybe 3 times. (instead of the advertised 5) There are some great product videos on their website. [...]"
4,No Bones to Pick here.,"I can't help but think of this series as Harry Potter for younger readers. It does have certain qualities that the Potter-world lacks. While there are horrible examples of adults, there are several more examples of parents and adults really trying to take an active role in their children's lives. And while Charlie Bone is the title character he isn't the epicenter of these books' universe, there is more more team playing going on.In this book, several new characters are introduced but only explained in the breifest of detail. I would have loved for more background information on Alice Angel and Billy Raven's guardian. Billy is a key player once again, and a new ally is gained through Ezekial's botched black magic. Probably one of the best twists in the series.A very quick read, but well worth it. I think these books are just so enjoyable."
3,A let down,"This book is on a whole quite good. The idea for the plot is well laid out and has great potential but as one continues reading the part of the ""Castle the of Mirrors"" is relatively small, and not interesting. Also Jenny Nimmo has confused the readers by creating to many charecters of the same likeness. Such as Lyell Bone, Mr Pilgrim, and Albert Tuccini.So overall a good book but not as good as the other three."
4,"When Charlie Bone Gets Older, He Aspires To Be Harry Potter","Call me a sheep. I'm as big a fan as the next kid of Harry Potter on the edge of my seat awaiting each new installment. So while I'm waiting, it was good to find Jenny Nimmo's Charlie Bone and the Invisible Boy. Another boy going to another school not solely comprised of wizards, but with enough of them to make it seem so. While the series may seem clone-like, I still think it's fantastic for the slightly younger wizard in your household. They're much easier to read with simpler story lines, but still have enough pull to keep the youngster enthralled.This is the fourth book in the series which also includes Charlie Bone and the Time Twister, Midnight for Charlie Bone, and Charlie Bone and the Invisible Boy."
4,Exciting and Magical,"Charlie Bone and the Castle of Mirrors is about Charlie helping Billy escape evil parents. It is filled with fun,mystery,magic,and more. An easy read for ages 9-12. Other books recommended if you enjoy this one are the other Charlie Bone books."
1,Review,"All of the ""Children of the Red King"" books have the same theme, ""Save person from evil Yewbeams and Bloors,"" and this book also follows the theme. This gets a bit annoying. Also the author continally gives the readers a hope that Charlie will find his father, but that never happens (and I expect it never will). Also too many new characters are introduced, and it is very awkward that Olivia ""suddenly"" has a talent. I liked the first three books, but this one is disappointing."
2,"The ""Bad Apple"" of the series","Now, before the ""Castle if Mirrors"", I was a big Charlie Bone fan, I could not wait for this book to come out. All of the other books had unique interesting plots. However by the time Nimmo got to this book, she lost her touch. For example, this book had way to much ""Harry Potter"" take offs, which you could easily find if youve read both books and paid even the slightest attention. Also so much of the information in this book was completely pointless and overloaded (unless she plans to use it for her later books. And what was really corny was the whole new thing about one of the characters who has already been in the other books has just suddenly gained a power. Anways, readof you like, but I don't know if it will be worth it."
3,easy read..more the same,"more of the same. If you liked Harry potter, you might like these. My daughter didn't because she didn't want to read more about a boy that finds out he can do magic. And goes to a school for kids like him. more of the same. but still a cute story."
3,"Excellent for its time, now dated.","The ideas in the short stories are a bit dated, yes, but I was actually referring to the fact that most of them have been collected in newer, later short story compendia so there is an excellent chance that you've already read a good number of them. Gibson's work, of course, is well represented, as are Greg Egan and Bruce Sterling. One of the few short stories written by Neal Stephenson is in this edition, also. It is easy to see where he began to feel out the structure of the model <u>Snowcrash</u> from this particular story.For the reviewers who have been complaining about this book, it's a collection of short stories about hackers of various kinds (computer, code, intelligence, even DNA) and not about [ha,cr]ackers as the media usually portrays them."
1,A nice book,"I think all of these books that are hacker/phreak based like bruce sterling's ""the hacker crackdown"" make us look like criminals that should be locked up in top security prisons which we are not of course the feds make it look that way I can beleive they would nab us for hacking a goverment site and they always get put back together so why do we get nabbed and put in the clink if everything gets back to normal you should read this book and many others and they will all say the same things that we are criminals you decide for yourself and read it"
2,Not the Original Mop Refilll,"Those expecting to find the original Quickie mop refill 0553 will be disappointed. Quickie no longer makes that refill, and instead they offer this cheaper version (made in China) that has an inferior sponge and plastic connections. It will work, but the sponge is not of the same quality as the original. Even online ads that show the old metal bracket and metal wing nuts do not actually have that model. They are using old photos and descriptions that no longer portray what they send."
2,Not the same quality,"The mop replacement is not the one shown in the photo. The one in the photo is sponge, with a metal spine, and metal screws. This is exactly like my old mop refill. On this new mop replacement, the spine is plastic, as are the attachment ""screws"". I haven't used it yet, so I don't know if the new plastic version is going to work as well as my old mop."
3,As advertised,"The book was exactly how advertised, new. I would've given five stars but I paid to have the book shipped within a couple days and it took almost 2 weeks. It wasn't acceptable to me. So, I'm giving three stars which I think is generous."
2,Racial Posturing,"The critical praise of this book is shockingly inapplicable. Presumptuous posturing is it's M.O. Speaking not only for ""skin pirivileged"" whites, but speaking for other racial groupings as well. (In contrast, this is where, Steele's appropriate sense of humility comes in.) This work falls apart once the p.c. hierarchies of the most oppressed are deconstructed. I.E. class is never a very important issue, althoug he obliviously contradicts himself on this. His arguments are not supported by hard examples but by a subconscious acceptance of racial essentialism, meaning monoliths about ""whiteness,"" ""blackness"" and ""white skin privilige."" He is not only mistreating the wounds but misdiagnosing and ignorantly caricaturing the patients. This would not be so bad if it were done in well intentioned and earnest misunderstanding. But a well-placed and, yes, priviliged, educational elite ""Oughta"" know better!"
5,"Sleek and cool, perfect size","This blends well in our modern style apartment. We didn't want an old-school white or wood one, so I'm glad I found this one. Nice price, perfect size, just right."
1,cute idea,"i really wanted the fisher telescoping pen but decided on this one for the price, i have rotring pens which worked very well but this one is junk it looks nice but the telescoping part (in out of the refill) is very tough to manipulate & it does not always go back in all the way.i will be getting the fisher pen soon, the only pens i use now."
2,Needs a lot of Fabrication,"I ordered the Gibson 615571 Stainless Steel System (1990 Short Box Chevy PU). The pipes were all bent fine, but one seemed to be too short. It caused all the brackets to be off position, and all had to be modified. I needed additional steel and a welder to install. The brackets/clamps in the system are not stainless steel. Also, stainless pipes seem to be more rigid and require all the joints to be tack welded or the pipes will twist at the joints (all brands seem to do this).This was not my first install but it was the worst."
5,Have a problem? Let's fix it...,"I've very much enjoyed Simon Brown's other books on feng shui but was still surprised how much value I got out of this one. The bulk of the book is spent giving solutions to very specific and common life dilemmas interspersed with short pieces on the basic principles of feng shui. I found it easy to identify and remedy what in my home was going in a direction I didn't want to go. I previously had been strengthening compass directions that needed compensating for, instead. I also learned alot about the balance of yin and yang and how fundamental this balance is to moods, life tendencies and choosing which solution to implement. An easy to read book with lots of nice visuals."
1,FM useless and controls hard to work,We got the player and charged it up. There was no problem loading music onto it. However when we tried to listen to the radio station we usually listen to when out for walk we could not get it. Only one station would come in clearly where we normally could get dozens. We also had trouble switching from mp3's to FM and then put it into some mode we could not seem to get out of. Rather than fight with it we sent it back.
1,Beware Mobiblu Tech Support!!,"I own the 1Gig version and decided to buy the 2Gig version for a friend. My 1G cube had some kind of internal malfunction which required it being sent to Mobiblu Tech Support. They fixed it promptly and it has since performed flawlessly. The 2 gig model refused to load more the 1G of unprotected mp3's. I sent it in along with a detailed description of the problem. They returned it saying they had verified its function. It had the same problem, holding no more than 1G. Further attempts to contact them by email were not successful. I think they had their email filter ignore me. I will never buy another Mobiblu product even though I like my FUNCTIONAL cube. I was within the 30 day window, so Amazon took it back. Caveat Emptor!"
4,Sounds and works great,"I've had mive for several years now.Works great, sounds grea.Works on XP and VistaBecause its so small with limited and multi-functional buttons it can take some skillto get used to how it works.People are still shocked by the sizeAmerican Science and Supply sells a matching external speaker - creates a two cubic inch boom box"
1,Never received the product I bought,"I got a different product of the one I ordered. I contacted by email Unbeatable since December 3rd, but they never got a RA to return the product . Later I got a call from I believe to be customer service asking me for my email to send instructions (which was weird because in their files they already had it). I kept on looking for the email, but never found it.Write them another email, no answer yet.So I am stuck with a product that I do not want.Does anyone wants a bottle of Nirmala by Molinard eau ? Because I wanted Les Feminines Nirmala by Molinard."
4,LOVES THESE !,"These are SO comfortable and true to size. One thing I didn't like is that they crease in the front on top, in center, pretty badly (about a 1 inch crease). They are very nice looking sneakers though and extremely comfortable that I can deal with the crease."
2,Skeecher's no lace the greatest,"I had bought a pair of the white no lace Skeechers. When I saw the tan ones at Amazon and even cheaper than I paid, I jumped at the chance. I only wish for them in black & brown."
2,not good,its not interesting at all it gets boring and the girls are old so not a lot to see if you want to buy the movie for the sex scenes...And if you want to buy the movie for some other reason i dont see another reason to buy it...
2,A major disapointment!,"While most people expect wonderful things from Peterson guides, this CD set is sure to let you down.It's is very limited in the number of birds it covers. And the recordings for each bird are minimal at best."
1,Boooorrrrrrrrrrrring (a student's review),"The book is boring to me. If people read it and liked it, I wouldn't care. It's what I think. It's just another dumb book about heroes, blah, blah, blah. I've read a million books like it. Boring!"
5,Great starter for chapter books!,"This is a great set of books for children who are past the ""easy"" reading books and need to move on, but not at chapter book level. My son loves this series. He couldn't put it down and laughed through them. I wish there were more Ricky Ricotta's books written. Highly recommended!"
4,Beautiful Voice -- Some Great Songs,"I first heard Gretchan Harris driving home from work, on a rainy day. Her beautiful voice and kind spirit shown through in the live broadcast I was listening too. So, I had to get the CD, with most of the songs I heard, SIGN OF LOVE, was that CD. I really like the more folky tunes, like Communion. Some of the up tempo stuff could use some work, but overall this CD is a real treasure."
3,Black Ice,"I had heard many things about this memoir, and they prompted me to buy the book. Upon reading it, I did not find the memoir particulary challenging, nor was it particularly well written. While it is clear that the writer expressed her experiences as an inner city black in a historically all-white prep school, her account did not ""go"" anywhere. If the point of the book was merely to explain how difficult the whole experience was, then so what? It was no differentthan that of similar memoirs. I did not come away with any sense of admiration for her, nor pity either. The popularity of another memoir, THE GLASS CEILING, which contains frightening accounts of a dysfunctional family had more of an impact. That memoir spoke of actual survival, children's survival. BLACK ICE paled by comparison, and there exist other works which detail survival in prep schools with more drama and impact."
1,not very postive,"Lorene Carey's book, left alot to be desired. THe racism inside of the pages is either subtle or seemingly imaginary. I beleive she did experience racism, however not to the degree of less fortunate African Americans. Little things to do with racism that could have been mistakenly perceived are what she concentrates and is enraged about more so then her rape. Though her rape was under odd circumstances she doesnt seem bothered by it as much as things that should have held less pain from."
5,Book,Got this for a college Women Studies' class. Also can be used for general reading. Very good book & highly recommended for students interested in African-American history.
4,Good book,"This book is interesting, and the author actually spoke at my school (Temple University) which was awesome. She goes into detail within the book and leaves you guessing."
1,this was one of the worst books I have ever had my hands on.,From the start of the book you basicly knew what the whole plot was and it was one of the biggest waste of my that I have ever done. And the only reason that I finished this book was that it was requerd reading for the class I was taking.
3,Black Ice Review,"The author of Black Ice is Lorene Cary. This book is mostly about racism, and a young girl named Lorene being highly educated] and working with whites in a restaurant. I think anybody older than twelve and up will enjoy this text; Black Ice was mostly talking about Lorene's childhood.This book was quiet interesting. In order to see if a book is going to be good, read the reference page. If its interesting then read the first page. If you not, ask for assistance.This novel will be a good book for fifth graders. It will help them know more about the past between blacks, and whites. It will help increase your vocabulary, and give you more history out of the story. By a chance, you will probably enjoy reading Lorene Cary's autobiography of her childhood life."
3,"Certainly a good book, just not my type.","I have to say, Carey is a good author, but this work was slightly boring, and ""cheesy"". Not a book I would tell a friend to avoid, but also not one I'd tell them to read right away. If you are looking for a high school growing up story, this is probably a good choice for you."
3,I Could Relate To An Extent,"An okay book that sort of bogs down as it goes on. I guess I got tired of the self-reflexion after awhile. I had gone to a racially mixed high school (not a boarding one, however), so I could relate to some of the author's experiences."
1,Very bad,"This book is horrible. The writing is badly done, and it is so drawn out and boring. It felt like one hour to read one chapter it was so bad."
1,Dull and confusing...,"I recently finished reading the book Black Ice, and did not understand what the whole point of the book was. i also had to write a report on the book and you dont have any idea how many hours i spent and headaches I had trying to find some plot the story.a definite ""dont-read-unless-you-have-to"" and a big disappointment.I am a big reader, and I have found few books boring, but this book was a clear exception."
4,Great old Classic,"This is a great classic, one that I have tried to find for a long time. I did consider it a bit pricey compared to other old Westerns on sale, but bought it anyway. No regrets."
2,M.,"I be very sad about this release!Yes i was searching along time ago,too.Yes it is a great classic one.Yes it is great, that's release,but the picturequality is in someparts really bad.And why are a b/w-release???Information for all Randy Scott-Fans!This movie is in ""COLOR"" filmed,too!!!And the quality it's better.Also the titles:1.The Nevadan,1950,c/bw2.The Cariboo Trail,1950,c/bwI think it goes better.""All Scott-Fans send a message to Warner""For this price, were the best release ,the right thing for all customers!!!"
2,"Good Basics, But No Coverage of Threads AT ALL","The coverage of WinSock basics in this book is quite good, but the book has an Achilles heel - it's sorely out of date, concentrates on the 16 bit model way too much, and has NO THREADED EXAMPLES AT ALL (async winsock work is covered entirely with message-based calls, on the grounds that this approach is portable to Win16 - like I care about that anymore).If you're interested in threaded Winsock work, then wait for a new edition or look elsewhere. If you're still writing for 16 bit Windows then (a) this book is fine for you, and (b) you have my condolences."
2,Outdated,"This is a Winsock 1.0 primer. There is a hastily-written ending chapter on 2.0, but it is far too brief.In short, this book was a disappointment and is badly in need of a new edition."
4,Very good winsock guide & reference,"This is one of the best programming books I've read! In the six months since I've bought this book and read through it, I've managed to program my own winsock wrapper class & functions along with a Win32 client-server app, based mainly on code and principles from this book. The included examples do need a bit of tweaking to work on MS VC++ 4.2, 5.0, and 6.0; and the executables included are mostly 16-bit apps; but the code itself is extremely useful."
5,The best Winsock book for every programmer.,It simply covers all the topics you need to understand before writing any Winsock application. I wish Microsoft will add the comments from this book to their MSDN and Visual C++ help file.
2,no good examples,"This is the most frustrating programming book I've ever read. It explains everything and shows how it works. Great, now how do I use it in a program? After explaining sockets, there are no examples how to use them until pages later. By then, it's be through so much, I can't understand how to do simple things, not to mention the pseudocode everywhere. I'm a self-taught programmer (good books) that now teaches high school students to program, yet I can't get a single thing from this book on how to program."
3,This book is not the best choice,"This book is poorly organized; if you have read alot of textbooks, this book might annoy you. On the other hand, the author knows what he is talking about, and covers MANY things. I've decided to go with the book ""Winsock 2"", seeing as how its reviews are favorable."
4,"A very explanatory text, but none of the programs compile",This is a very good book for a beginner in the network programming world. But it has some drawbacks: none of the examples in this book compile with the Visual C++ 6 compiler. The author of this book used the old calling conventions (win3.1) in the code thus making it useless for programmers who do not know how to program in Win16.
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Rose Rico, Rebel. A very alliterative monkier for this overly desiredheroine. Despite the covers and title there is very little to no overtsex in these books. This is more about Rose breaking away fromcaptivity, gaining friends and allies, and seeing what she can to do tostrike back at the alien sex fiends. (not the band, however)."
1,Left out,"This book is entirely subjective. As an educator in N.Y.C for many years, there are excellent outstanding schools that are totally missing from the author's accounts and terrible schools that she rates highly. It is totally unreliable for parents."
4,"A good, fast cooking grill!","I'm a bbq and grilling fanatic! I recently purchased this grill from a local home improvement store (they didn't have any in the box so I got the display and saved about $40 off of the retail price and didn't have to assemble anything - I know, I know - I'm blessed)!This grill is a nice one. I give it major ""kudo's!"" The only complaint I have about it is that it cooks very fast (which is better than it cooking very slow). But that's what grilling is; a faster method of outdoor cooking than bbq'ing - so I really can't complain.I can easily fit 3 slabs of pork spareribs (what other type of ribs ""truly"" exist) on the grill at one time although one of those slabs has to be cut in half.If your looking for a sturdy grill with a large cooking area, this is it."
5,Not so hard to assemble after all,"It may be that the company has reworked the instructions, but we didn't find this item too hard to assemble. It takes two people because of the size and weight of the pieces. As with all directions, it really pays off to read them all the way through before starting. However, the instructions could be improved if they included a complete parts list (there is a list, only of the small parts - bolts, nuts, washers, pins). Our biggest issue: the hubs that are supposed to keep the wheels on the axle could use improvement - they just fall off. Not an issue if you don't plan to roll the unit around much, especially when it's hot."
5,Awesome Modern-gothic horror tale,"Clegg's NAOMI is one of the best books Leisure has ever published. Fast paced and exciting with no filler, not to mention some very ghoulish imagery, which is something that has been missing from many ""horror"" novels lately. ....A must read for real horror fans."
1,A dull tale of a haunting.,"Naomi dies under the rails of a New York subway train. Or does she? Jake, Naomi's childhood friend and, apparently, her one, true love, goes to look for her. Something is dug up in yard of an old building being restored. What does this have to do with Naomi's death? Frankly I did not care enough to find out.Evidently Douglas Clegg's novel was an e-serial, which explains the fragmented and inconsistent narrative flow of the novel and how it seems more tease than actual terror. It's a literate piece of writing, just not scary enough for me."
2,I want to like Clegg . . .,"But I keep running across his worst books.I'm a big horror fan, and I keep coming back to Clegg because other authors recommend him. His prose and characters are beautiful, but there is no action, no real point to the two books of his I've read: Naomi and Nightmare House.The positive reader reviews he gets puzzle me; I am just bored by what I've read so far. I like to read, and Clegg comes across as a likeable person through his writing, so I'm sure I'll give another of his books a chance. I just hope the next one is better."
2,Kinda hard to get through...,"While reading this book I felt like I was underwater, meaning that maybe there was a good story there above the surface, but I just couldn't reach it. It was boring and the plot was very disjointed. I had no connection to the characters and there was absolutely no action whatsoever."
4,Good tale of witchcraft,"This is not as good as other books by Clegg, but mysterious, dark, compelling with tragic characaters who must redeem their lives. Witchcraft plays a major role here. The book is very gothic and dark, but that's Clegg's style: he's better than anyone out bthere in creating such dark fiction in horror and human tragedy."
2,reads like a first draft,"This novel rambled on aimlessly and the writing was poor in spots. I had recently read his NIGHTMARE CHRONICLES, which I thought was very good, and I expected much more from this author. I only got about 90 pages into it before I gave up."
3,Not bad,"A collection of interesting stories but many ended in ""not guilty"" verdicts, more due to lack of evidence. Whodunnit is pretty obvious to the average reader on many occassions. Other crimes are really strange, some really are mysteries..."
4,This album is slightly addictive,"I try to avoid the phrase 'whiskey soaked"" when describing a singer's voice. Not because it is not a great description only because it is slightly over used. However it would take someone far more clever than me to come up with a better way to describe Rocky Votolato's particular quality. It's smooth and unnervingly effective. When he sings he sings stories of Jack Daniels, past loves, and mistakes. The melodies are incredible, but simple. There are more than a few that are so lovely and spot on you may have goosebumps. I can't get enough of tracks 2, 3, or 11."
5,"Extraordinary work, explaining the real meaning of Judaism","I borrowed this book in a public library. Had no big hopes, but was curious. How wrong I was. I practically devoured it after reading a few pages. Rabbi Borowitz has the special talent of knowing how to explain in simple words very complicated philosophical concepts of Judaism. Besides he does it in such a candid manner that my eyes went wet several times. Believe me, if you want your child to understand the essence of Judaism, this the book to give him/her as a gift. The title is a bit misleading, no matter which is your denomination - Reform, Conservative or Orthodox, even if Christian, this book will bring you the warmth of real ""menchlichkeit"" - how to become a decent human being."
3,On liberal judaism....,"Though it is a short book, it gives one a good description of Reform Judaism. This book shows the evolution of this form of Judaism and how many times it's changed. Sadly enough, though, it paints the picture of a confused religious view that lacks consistency. This book would arouse one to possibly explore their cultural and political associations, but lack a lot on the spiritual side."
1,Save your time and money,"The was the dumbest book I ever read, a waste of time, paper, and money. I love the '50s, and I love cars, so I thought this might interest me. There is a weak plot here, and it is impossible to feel anything for any of the characters because they are not developed. The character of Claire Hathaway makes no sense at all. Morris was really stretching it for some substance, especially near the miserable end. No wonder it was in the $1.98 pile at Barnes & Noble's"
2,Was falling apart from day one,"I really don't reccomend this bouncer. We bought this bouncer for our third child and the previous ones were much better. The covers that snap over the rubber feet constantly fell off and were missing within a week or so. It does adjust back and forth, but one of the angles where the bars meet is cracked and almost completely broken. We have to adjust one side at a time with quite a bit of force, and sometimes can't tell if both sides are adjusted the same. The music/vibrating box is no longer on ours because the fabric is ripping and tearing in that area. My daughter loved the music, so that was a plus. She seems to enjoy it, but it's really starting to look rough. The toys are nothing special, so my 4 and 2 yr old took off with those a long time ago. Maybe better for someone who doesn't frequently use a bouncer."
4,No missed dinners!,Pretty yet practical too. two positions made this bouncer usable even when our baby was newborn. we just move it from counter top to table top. Our princess is 4 months now and she's loving the toys now.
3,nice but has problems.,"My 3 month old loves this. We bought this before she was born, it is cute, easy to wash, BUT the feed do move all over the place, if you don't put the vibrate and music part in just right it does pop off, you have to put it on before the seat cover. the worst thing is I hate how when you pick up or lay baby down the crinkle of the directions on the back of the seat, it is a Kids II flaw in desingn as our rock in comcort boppy travel swing does the same thing! Over all it is good value for the money, but has some problem you should be ready for."
1,UGH,"I received this as a gift, and kept it though I thought it might not work too well. Once my little girl arrived, she hated it. The seat jut sinks in in the middle and she just looked VERY uncomfortable. There is no head support, so I would NOT recommend this for an infant. The toy bar broke almost immidiately, and if you have children you know, it would be nice to be able to grab it by the toy bar and move it (without the child in it of course). I bought the Pretty in Pink Calming Vibrations and it is much better, I just have one complaint about that. My son constantly snatches off the toys (velcro) and hides them around the house!"
4,A little more trust would have been nice.,"This is a good book - nice, solid character definition; good hero; good heroine; lots of dialouge; good plot.So, what kept it from getting a five star review? I really love it when characters in books I'm reading trust each other. Now, don't get me wrong, I don't expect Catherine to trust her new husband right away. They are, after all, perfect strangers.But over and over again, Gray proves himself trustworthy. Over and over again, he shows his strength tempered by compassion. And over and over again, she underestimates her husband.Of course, she eventually trusts him and tells him her secrets.All in all, though, this was a good book and a great debut novel."
3,a good read,"this is a good book - a solid 4+ stars without the Kindle issues... what I didn't enjoy: The last line of each page was missing - too much thinking involved with that, made it difficult to enjoy the read!"
3,Am I getting jaded?,"I bought this book on the strength of the Amazon community reviews...famous last words.I read lots of romance novels. And this one is 'good' but, five stars? Hmmmmmmmm. The plot has good moments, and the writer is creative, but still...I can't put my finger on it, but I was able to put this one down with no problem. My criteria for a 5-star read has to be that I didn't want to stop reading. I didn't have that feeling with this novel -- and I could wait to pick it up again too. Maybe I thought it was too melodramatic. It felt like I'd met this hero & heroine before. If I were grading it like in school, I'd give it an 85 out of 100, or a B+. So, yes, I think it's good, but it's not the gripping, emotional keeper that other reviewers described, at least not for me."
3,Review on Review...!!!,"Just want to put a few things straight for record....as the reviewer on this book says..""azad's religious bias against Parsad and Patel..."" so how would u rank R.Gaandhi's (the author)book, ""a religious bias against muslims""....??? i wonder..!!Mr.gandhi has tried to challenge the narration of events he was not even present at. Whereas Azad has narrated his biography and story of his own life, and i dont think anyone cannot deny as to how closely alligned Azad was to the front line/mainstream politics of India in his time. The only evidence, if any, against Azad could be brought from his contemporaries."
4,This guy can sing!,"Jeff Scott Soto, owner of one of the most powerful pair of pipes of heavy music EVER, released his best solo effort with this album. Assembling a fanastic line up (including Journey guitarist Neal Schon, this ialbum is just amazing. THere is a general eighties ""feel"" to it, but it does not soung dated at all. The songs are well crafted, the guitar solos will leave you breathless. There is the obligaory power ballad (""If This Is The End"") but that's not a total waste, because is has weight int it.This album is one of those albums that you will enjoy from the first listen."
4,The quality certainly isn't lost in the translation here.,"As if Prism never happened Soto delivers a quality hard rock album, wrapping his pipes around worthy tunes. An extensive enough world tour accompanied this album and rightly so. The first few cuts, Believe in Me and Soul Divine are good rockers, while Soto's balladeering instincts don't take the record over.I'm not going to go into a track by track thing here as there isn't much point, suffice to say that the guy has achieved a balance between rockers like the title cut and softer numbers that wasn't the case on Prism. Good production values, packaging and another disc with a bonus video track on it for a little added value. The continued presence of Gary Shutt is another plus for this relese and shared writing credits with Neil Schon, Gary Shutt and other guitarists perhaps show that Soto works best when he works with others.Quality release and a good buy for fans of melodic rock especially and general music fans too."
4,Rock Solid Effort !!,This album took me by surprise but from first listen it blew me away !. If you like a classic hard rock feel with big vocals and guitar you will not be dissapointedThis allbum is bang for buck. Play on 10 !
4,My wifes's new favorite CD,"My wife is a HUGE journey fan. As a result, when Jeff stepped in as the new singer for the band, she was very interested. Then she heard the single ""Believe in me "" and wanted to hear the rest. Now she is hooked. Never comes out of the CD player!"
5,My 9 Month Old Niece LOVED This Book!!,"At age 9 mos. my little niece LOVED this book. She would sit on our laps and listen and smile at each page. She has plenty of books, but this is the one she chooses most often."
5,15 Month Old Loves It,My 15 month old son just loves this book. He walks arounds saying La La La when he wants us to read this one to him. I highly recommend this one.
4,It is a nice read,"I just bought this book few days ago and my daughter loves it. She enjoy reading it with my husband and I. This is not the best one we have ever read, but it certainly is very nice. A must buy!"
5,Another favorite!,Sandra Boynton continues to shine in this bright and funny children's book. I have purchased many of her books and my grandchildren continue to choose her books over other authors. I purchase her books as gifts to new mothers. The rhyme and rhythm of her books makes it easy for infants to enjoy.
5,My babies favorite book,"My 8 month old baby was given this book recently, and she just loves it. She enjoys it so much, she will let me read it to her again and again. She just sits and smiles at the animal sounds. It really grabs her attention. She's able to focus on the pictures and sounds, so it's a great introduction to books and reading. This is a great beginning book for parents to read to their babies."
4,"Good, but not our favorite","Really, you can't go wrong with any Sandra Boynton book; they are the best. I am leaving this review for people who are trying to choose, since we now have accumulated quite a few of her books. This book starts out great, reading with Boynton's signature sing-songy rhythm, but abruptly falls flat at the end. Our favorite Boynton books are the ones that facilitate the most interaction: Snuggle Puppy, Horns to Toes, and Belly Button Book. Happy Hippo, Angry Duck is a great book to read when your baby is cranky. Our bedtime favorites are Pajama Time and The Going to Bed Book."
1,Uninspiring,"When I saw the 5 star rating, I thought I just have to get this for my 11 mth old son. He has no interest in the book at all when we got it. I am so disappointed because I can see why my son is disinterested. The pictures are nothing great, they are the usual farm animals. My son has other toys and books related to animals and the sounds they make and those are by far much more interesting.I bought another book by Sandra Boynton "" The Going To Bed Book"". That too was a disappointment. I guess I'm too afraid to buy another Boynton title soon.Good Night Moon by Margaret Wise Brown and Pat the Bunny by Dorothy Kunhardt are stellar winners by far and all time favourite with my little one."
3,Could confuse kids,"A great story about animal sounds. Most of the sounds are accurate, however I have a problem with the 3 singing pigs...would they really sing ""La, La, La""? Would a child recognize Boynton's use of rhyme and really ""get it""? I think not...I'm having a hard time now, when I took my son to the farm and he was saying ""La La La"" at the pigs...while all the other kids were saying ""oink"" or were more accurately making a snorting sound. Their parents looked at my son as if he was not as smart as their genius kids who knew the proper pig sounds.Thanks Ms. Boynton...thanks a lot."
1,My kid hates this book,"It's probably a fine book, but every time I pick it up she starts screaming, ""No, no!"" So I really have no idea what it's about."
5,Entertaining,"Entertaining for a 5 month......i like the pictures of the animals.....actually, all of Sandra Boynton's book appeal to me and my LO......it never gets old"
4,Moo LA LA!,My LO loves all the noises I make when I read this book to her. Watching her is more fun than reading the but! Very cute story!
5,Oink?,"Oh my, the cow and sheep seem to have it right...but what about the pigs? This divinely witty animal-sounds book had my own babies in stitches when they were almost too young to look at the pictures.The rhythmic cadence of the words (always a grabber for the very young), the simple wording, the silliness that can be enhanced by mom or dad's tone of voice when reading aloud, and most of all, the use of the word ""you,"" bringing the child into the story, combine to make a treasure of a book.Oh...did I mention Sandra Boynton's incredibly endearing pictures of animals? Rendered in bright, beautiful colors on sturdy, indestructible pages, they are worth the price of the book. I'll bet you anything you sneak one more look long after night-night."
3,A GOOD ONE,I like this one. It's much longer and many more things to talk about. Multiple animals help to draw interest of my 20-month old baby. We use it every night.
5,Simple and adorable.......,Simple and adorable.......Moo Baa La La La ...Love this great toddler book....I bought for my daughter because we are always making animal sounds for fun with each other!~
5,so cute,"Such a cute little book. Sandra Boynton is a fantastic illustrator and author. I've never come across anything by her I haven't liked. I have never run across anything in her books that could be considered offensive or unsuitable for children or anyone else. Boynton' s books are always a good, safe, and adorable choice."
4,Cute book,"I like that the book goes over animal sounds and is a bit silly (pigs saying la la la!) My son is slightly interested in it and likes turning the pages more than anything right now. I think it's good to read to children, no matter how young, but I think 2 and up would get the most enjoyment out of this book."
5,very cute book,my little one loved this! it's perfect for attention-getting with its bright colors and pictures and for chewing (both of which are essential things for moms looking for something to entertain)
5,Moo-Baa-La-la-la,"This is a fun, lyrical book to read aloud. I've been giving it as gifts since my son was born almost 20 years ago."
5,Moo Baa La La La,This is an excellent book for the young ones that are just starting to be inquisitive about their surroundings. It helps them learn the different animals while they can touch the book and laugh and giggle along with you!
4,Moo moo,"I love this book - it's a fun, quick read and I love the author's sense of humor. My daughter is 2 1/2 and is a little luke-warm on the book, but I love it."
5,favourite book!,"my daughter had a copy of this that she loved so much! It was read and loved until it fell apart. We got her a second copy for her second birthday, and it's still a hit. Great rhymes, great illustrations. a classic"
5,Moo Baa La La La,"Love all Sandra Boynton's books. Love this one, too. Fun to read and even more fun to sing. Don't mind reading it over and over."
1,lame,"Was very excited after reading these reviews. When I skimmed the book, was not impressed, but figured my 2 yr old may enjoy. Not the case, he kind of looked at mea as if to say "" and then what happened"". Must say that the art / color was very nice and the stock / binding quite sturdy and well made. The story seemed to be missing something."
3,"Fun, and cute","I bought this for my 20month girl. It's not her favorite book, but she'll pick it up once in a blue moon for me to read to her."
1,Very disappointed,"I was so blown away by the effusive reviews on these books that I bought both full sets for my 17 month old grandson and one set each for my other four grandchildren, ages 18 months, 2 and 3 years, to give as Christmas presents -- all these children have many books and are read to on a regular basis. I was very disappointed -- I wish I had my money back!! The 17 month old bats the book away with his hand when I pick it up to read to him -- he will only listen to a bit of the ""Doggie"" book because I make all those tiresome dog ""barking"" sounds. The pictures are so simplistic -- a few sketchy lines -- that only the 3 year old can make sense of them. I have noticed that all the children are drawn to pictures of real photo-looking pictures of children and animals. and they all love Margaret Wise Brown because the words and pictures are something that they already know about and recognize. If you want books that children will love to read over and over, look elsewhere."
5,The best book!!,"My son is 13 months and loves this books- and all of her books. They are perfect for his age and they totally captivate him. He laughs out loud and the silly things in her stories. He loves these books so much that when he his screaming his head, we pull out this book and he immediately stops and smiles."
5,A must-have for baby's first book,"My first son wanted this read over and over four years ago. Now, my two year old cannot get enough of it! After all those readings, it STILL gives me a little chuckle. I believe the sing-song-y nature of the prose is what appeals. With the last line, ""it's quiet now, what do YOU say?"" I point to my son's chest. After only a reading or two, each of my sons began to point at themselves when coming to that page. It was also an excellent way to introduce animal sounds."
5,Loved by the Whole Family,Sandra's books are my 1 year old's favorites. My 4 year old loves to read them to his little brother as well. Very cute.
5,The kids love it....,"I must admit, if I was rating this book on my opinion alone, I'd probably give it three stars, but when I review childrens books I rate them on whether or not they hold my granddaughter's interest. My two and four year old granddaughters love these books. This is one of their favorite. We all have it memorized. Probably a good five star toddler book is one that you read over and over and over...."
5,Daughter LOVES this book,My 18 month old daughter absolutely loves this book. We do not own it but her daycare does and she is always bringing this book to me to read. One of her favorites!
5,A must-have!,"This is a wonderfully fantastic book. My 18 month-old loves it. We read it at least 3 times while she's on the potty. :) As soon as she sits on her potty she asks for the ""Moo book"".I read the lines and she says the sounds that the animals make! It's so interactive that it makes her relax and go-potty. :) To say we love this book is an understatement! :)"
3,"For Boynton, not bad.","Of the four Boynton books my son received for his birthday, this is the only one that may be spared from the trash can. The illustrations are okay, not great. The book is the standard, ""cow says, 'moo'. Sheep says, 'baa'"" book, with the one CONFUSING exception of some singing pigs, followed by oh, wait, no, no, no, pigs say 'oink'. This is also the only one of the four books with a pretty good ending, the animals ask ""what do you say?"". Pretty cute ending, that's what might save it in our house, but the rest of the book is just on the low end of okay."
5,This game is awesome,"Everything about this game is awesome, especially the part in which Mario falls asleep when you don't move him for a while. Pure genius!!!"
5,Best Platform game,"I rented the Nintendo 64 just so I could play this game. It was amazing. Very engrossing, awesome graphics, and very fun. It was definately worth it. I would not want to have a Nintendo 64 without this title. Anyone who has a N64 should play this game. It's definately one of the *must have* titles."
5,one word--classic,"When this came out, I remember spending most of my time for a week trying to beat the game. I did, I loved it, and I sold it. I'm now kicking myself for ever getting rid of it--even though there is no replay value in that the story and game stays the same, you always want to return to the classics at some point. Especially if they rock like this one does."
4,cool,"What a great game, I like it alot. The only problems I found were:1: It gives off way too many hints to how to complete a puzzle or beat a boss(EXAMPLE: On the first time you fight Bowser, he says ""Can you get behind me and grab my tail? I think not!""2: Moving around is kinda stupid because Mario can't move to the different direction fast enough and he slips on the floor when he moves.Other than these flaws, this is a solid title that deserves to be in your collection."
5,All Time Platform Champ,"Super Mario 64 was one of the first games for the Nintendo 64 and to this day is one of the best. Mario 64 is the be-all and end-all of 3-d platforming. Mario has 120 stars to collect in many different worlds. Mario swims, flies, jumps, runs and crawls. This game is immense fun, and definitively replayable. A masterpeice by Shigeru Miyamoto."
3,An Adult that Has Trouble With This type of Game,"My kids really enjoy this game, especially my 5, 8 and 11 year olds. My teenagers played it until they mastered it and now leave it alone. I personally had trouble devoting the time to it necessary to learn enough to enjoy it at all."
3,Eh I guess it's okay,"Okay this game is the reason they created difficulty settings. Some of the stars are just plain infuriating to get. And it has the exact same plot as every other Mario game. OMFG Bowser stole Peach whatever shall we do?! Get an ugly princess or something! And where the hell are the king and queen anyways?! The hats were also poorly implemented. The Flying cap is hard to use, the metal cap is rare, at best, and the computer can still see you when you use the invisible cap. They should have stuck to the 2D side scroller. And also where is Yoshi?! The fact that in later levels the edge of the map is always a bottomless pit is also frustrating."
3,.......A kinda boring game.....,"I own this game and have only played it a couple of times because it really is very boring. It's only a one person game, and it gets really old after awhile (if you know what I mean). But if you live alone, and have A LOT of times on you're hands then buy it. But if you're purchasing it for a young child..... DON'T! They won't like it at all. It's very hard, too. But hey, if you want a very, extremely, hard chalenge... then good for you! BUY IT! But my opinion is.... IT'S BAD! Mario Cart is a much better game. Bottom Line: Don't waste your money."
3,"Fun, but sloppy controls make it hard.","The game is fun, but simple tasks can be very hard thanks to the sloppy controls. If you die, you start the level all over again. I spent three hours Trying to collect the 8 red coins of cool. cool. Mountain. The sloppy controls kept me sliding of mountains, causing me to start all over. I don't recomend it for younger children unless they dont mind messing around in the first few levels."
1,"fun game, didn't work",The game was very fun until it stopped working about 3 minutes in. I would like a new game cartridge
5,THE BEST GAME I EVER PLAYED!!!!!!!!!,"This is my number 1 Mario game! The game has great graphics,awesome storyline and super good music. The levels are a bit challenging but still fun. Go buy this game but like I said on other games don`t buy this game at that ridiculus price! Go get this game at game-x-change or at a flee market. Happy hunting:)! P.S. you want to hear some facts about this game? If you think that you need a memorycard on this game you don`t,you can play this without a memorycard. This my last fact. This game is the funest game ever for the n64 sireously. If you think I`m lieing do a google search and type is super Mario 64 the best game on the nintendo 64. Thats all!"
5,A Certified Classic!,Super Mario 64 brings back a lot of memories when playing this game. This is a must have for all those who had this game growing up. Love all the sound fx and music also.
4,GREAT GAME!!,"great graphics, good gameplay. if you want a challenging game, get this one. its kinda hard, it'll keep you busy for a couple of weeks."
1,Be careful who you buy from,"This game did not work. It was a gift for my friend, so he did not tell me until some time after I gave it to him."
2,Disappointing...,"I'm very disappointed with this game.It takes forever to beat and the graphics aren't good.I expected much better of this game.Heres what i think:graphics:4/10sound:7/10gameplay:6/10difficulty:10/10story:7/10Only if you really like mario games get this one.Otherwise,forget about it."
5,Super Mario 64,The kids play this game at least once a week since they've had it so yes its worth the money
5,This game is perfect.,This game is excellent....this game has state of the art graphics for its time....and it still looks perfect now in 2008...you must own this.
5,"Excellent,but","Okay,the game is very addicting. The sound,graphics,gameplay is all great! But I discoverd something else funer. Super Mario 64 DS. That game is way better. This game is good but that game is something you can't keep your eyes off. Remember when you finish the game and eyerything to do and ther'es nothing left to do, well this DS game has mini games. They are very addicting and fun! You can draw on this as well. The adventure mode takes longer folks. You can play as Yoshi,Luigi,Mario Wario. In The beginning of Super Mario 64,you could just walk in. But thwe DS version is different. You have to collect a rabbit to get in. There is more room's in this castle too with more levels. Instead of collecting 120 stars. You have to collect 150. If you don't have enogh money for a DS and the game but have a N64,dust off the original and have some fun. Or go out and buy your DS and game. Get whatever. You have to play this though. If you don't think I'm right,then you will be sorry."
5,Super Mario 64,I think the game is very exciting. I think it's the best game I have ever played in my life. My dad and I both got 14 stars together. Thank you for making a good game.
4,Great game,This game is really good. The plot is a bit tired but with all the levels who cares. I think if the levels had harder bad guys and a bit more extensive plot that the game might be a fraction better. Overall it is a good game.
4,"Very entertaining, and also a bit chalenging.","I would highly recommend this game to any N64-er. It's challenging enough to keep you from getting bored, and it's also very entertaining. Granted, it does get a little too challenging at times. It may prove difficult to achieve all 120(?) stars. But a little hint from any free online guide will quickly solve any snags you run into. I do not advice purchasing this item from this venue; it's a tad bit expensive. You can go to any game exchange store, and buy almost any N64 game for usually $10 or less. But I do recommend this game!"
5,Good game if your a fan of Mario,I didn't use to be into Mario or Kirby but now I like them both as much as I like the Legend of Zelda series I still have many more games to purchase based on those 2 characters. But I think SuperMario 64 is a great story game a killer for the old games meant for the gameboy. So enjoy!
4,this is a MUST have,"first and best game i got 4 n64 (other then donkey kong64 wich is a really good game to)its really long and challanging and thats wut i like about it cuz its not one of those games that u beat in a hour like luigis mansion for gamecube, in all there are 120 stars but i only got 70 cuz thats all u need toface the last bowser wich is rainbow bowser and u have to throw him into 3 bombs to kill him but after u beat him the games not over cuz u have t get all 120 stars so the cannon in the front yard opensand i shots u to the roof and yoshis there and gives u 100 lifes ,dont think im jokin i know wut ur gonna say how do u know that if u only have 70 stars?its called i went over my friends house and he had 120 stars .so wut im saying is this game is a MUST have"
4,Pretty good,"I think this was one of the first Nintendo 64 games made. Mario has come a VERY VERY long way since it first came out on the NES. It has heaps and heaps of levels, which means it isn't an easy game to finish. I have had it for almost 3 years, and i still haven't finished it! However, it is a very enjoyable game."
4,Give Me A Hint,It's Impossible once you get 70 stars and go up the endlass staircase and try to beet bowser it is impossible once you through him into the bombs 2 times it is inpossible to through him into a bomb again me and my brother have both tried to beat him for the past 2 months. You through him twice comes back up onto the island starts jumping and having a hissy fit and then brakes half of the island off. can u give just the slitest hint how to beet him
4,Love the game and in decent condition,Little corrosion on inside of game. Scraped it off and it worked fine after that. In decent condition and plays well. Satisfied.
4,A classic in its own regard...,"Super Mario 64, the game that helped launch the Nintendo 64 machine, has become a classic since its original release in 1996. Super Mario 64 introduces the gamer to a truly three-dimensional world of the Mushroom Kingdom, and is a great start for a beginnning Nintendo 64 player. Smooth and solid gameplay involves the collection of stars from a variety of levels including desert, ice, grass, and fire areas. Once the game is finished however, it quickly loses its replay value. But there are enough objectives in Super Mario 64 to keep a gamer playing for hours"
5,super exitment,"Super Mario 64, a game filled with exitment. Collecting super stars on many different levels, beating them to open different sealed doors in princes peach's castle. I think super mario 64 is my favorite video game out of all of the video games I own."
5,super mario 64,"I love this game so much! The graphics aren't that good considering the standard of video games now, but it is still so fun to play! Great for all ages!"
5,Motove operandi,"Didnt work for the first 5 tries even with blowing the cartridge, but then I used my super duster spray, working like brand new."
5,"It's a bird, It's a plane, no wait... It's Mario","(...)My favorite thing about this game is the hats u find, they can make u fly like a bird!!! That's my alltime favorite thing about this game!!! I like other things about it to, but I just dunno how put them into words... I have played so many video games it's not even funny!!! So trust me, I know my video games well!!! (...)Bye!!!"
2,takes to long!,"this game takes to long to beat! and some levels make no sense like ""blast away the wall"" you havwta shoot at a random wall a smash it makes no sense how would i no to do that? yopu have to get 120 stars and ive had this game for ever and only have 60! i think you should think twice befor ordering this and dont order it for kids that dont have patience and have no time to finish it because it gets borin fast."
1,I still can't beleive this wasn't my first N64 game.,The absolute greatest mario title of all time! Mama mia!
4,Enjoyable but disjointed.,"I enjoyed the illustrations and their captions and I learned a great deal about shawls, shawl making, the ""paisley"" pattern and Paisley the city. While this thin book appeared that it would be an easy read, I found the chapters rather disjointed from each other making the transition from topic to topic difficult."
3,Not so great,"The movie itself isn't so great. Honestly, the only reason that I bought it to see the footage in the movie that was filmed in Centralia, Pa. before most of the buildings were torn down. I recently became interested in the history of the Centralia mine fires, and wanted to see how things used to look there when buildings were actually still standing."
4,hardware good; software -- needs improvement,"I bought this about 2 years ago for quite a princely sum and have had a pretty good time using it. The resolution is satisfactory, but the main problems are:- very grainy image at the pixel level; adjacent pixels are often jarringly different from each other in color; averaging them over an area produces the correct result, but with loss of detail(especially with people's eyes). Since I like to make large size poster prints, this is a problem for me. Shouldn't affect anyone working with 11"" x 17"" or less.- Software that removes blemishes from the image softens it too much. I've just given up on this ""feature"" and instead use the Photoshop rubberstamp tool to get rid of blemishes and scratches in the negative."
3,Nice Read,"Nice style of writing, good characterization and dialogue that was realistic and flowing. The author was able to weave a tale that had me crying at one point and laughing at another. So why three stars and not five? Well I honestly found the plot a little bit simplistic. The conflict between the main characters, Cathryn and William, is based entirely on William misjudging Cathryn's morals. William felt betrayed by what he thought Cathryn had done, and Cathryn became a victim once again. This ""misunderstanding"" (that is putting it mildly) kept them apart for more than half the book, when just a simple question on his part, or a brief explanation on her part would have cleared the matter up very quickly. It was easy to guess, after only a few pages, what had happened to Cathryn, and I found it frustrating that it took William half the story to reach the same conclusion.I loved Ms Dain's style of writing, and if the plot had been a more complex the book would have been a definite keeper."
4,A Very Nice Love Story,This is the second of Ms Dain's book that I have read. I enjoyed this book much more than Tell Me Lies. The story seem to flow better. The Heroine and Hero were believable for the time period. In fact the hero show great compassion when the story of the heroine is finally revealed. Although I suspected what was goig to happen the unfolding of the story and the steps he takes to solve the problem do the author credit. I would definetly read the book again.
3,It improves once get past the cover and the first chapter,"England, Winter 1155. ""Nineteen years of war had taken its toll on William's holding ... field were broken wastelands of scorched earth ... there would be no corn this winter"" (pg.1). Of course not! Corn is a New World crop that never existed in 12th-century England! I have to say, I put the book down after reading the 1st page and it was months before boredom forced me to pick it up again. I'm glad that I did. The plot is driven and, once started, I couldn't put it down. Tsk to Ms. Dain for poor research, but give her 10 pages and she will entertain you."
1,Not Worth Reading,"The initial chapter drew me in, with the imagery, and hint of an exciting story to come. The book did not fulfill its potential, and the writing deteriorated after the first chapter. This is the first book I attempted to read by this author, and will be the last."
1,"Thin, very thin",When I started this book I was expecting a Malorie Blackman adventure. I was disapointed. Half of the book I was wondering what the fuss was about... and the ending! So corny and obvious!
5,I love this book.,"I am so happy with my book. I love it! The recipes are so easy and afforable. The homeame rolls are out of this world, love these. I"
2,make-a-mix cookery,"Make-A-Mix CookeryCover had been folded and was bent and creased. Also, book was fairly well used with writing in several places. Thought I had ordered a new hardback."
5,The best in mix 'cookery'..,"I purchased this book because I like to have things made ahead; I'm always working or watching the grandkids. Too tired to come home and make a big meal. With this book, I can have bisquits, cornbread, cookies, soup, in just a little bit of time, simply by using the mix plus add-ons, like an egg, water. So quick and easy. I highly recommend this first book. Have made a lot of the mixes and use them a lot."
2,Wildlife of East Africa,"After leafing through the book, the cover came right off the spine. I will have to glue it back on with super glue. I book for $17.00 (incl. shipping) should not come apart at first try. Very bad workmanship.G. Schaefer"
4,Great intro book,"Took it to three parks in Tanzania and used it to identify or learn more about wildlife spotted during the safari. Covers mammals, birds, reptiles and trees in sufficient detail without much bulk. Great photographs."
2,Disappointed overall,"I bought this on the strength of previous reviews, but I am disappointed and will probably return it. No range maps! No real distribution information at all. No sizes! No tracks for mammals. No Swahili names. Teeny tiny print that you need a magnifying glass to read. The information is not really organized at all, but just strung out in one long paragraph, so you need to hunt through to find specifics. The photos are of varying quality...some not very good. Over 2/3 of the book is birds...I plan to bring a separate field guide for birds, so I didn't really need the bird section. Very few insects or reptiles. I suppose if you want an all-in-one book with a little bit of everything, it may be useful, but for my purposes, not so much. Its too bad there wasn't a preview for this one, or I would have know these things up front. I'm going to try this one for mammals, which seems much better organizedPocket Guide to Mammals of East Africa"
1,wildlife east africa,i am aware that my order was for a used product but the book was scribbled in on virtually every page
2,Better books out there,"We bought this book and National Audubon Society Field Guide to African Wildlife. The Audubon book was much better. I regret purchasing this book - I feel as though it was a waste of money and suitcase space. We only looked at this book to compare it to the Audubon book to see where this book was lacking. This book is slightly smaller than the Audubon book, but not enough to justify purchasing this one instead of the Audubon book."
4,Concise field guide,"I found nice reviews on Amazon before I purchased this book. What makes this field guide different from most is that the animal/plant discription and photographs are located on the same pages, so it easy to use, no seaching through different pages. Concise, easy to carry, and lightweight for use in the field."
5,Filled with photos and info!,This book was super! The photos and descriptions helped us relive our trip to Africa. It helped so much in identifying all of what we saw! Getting the book from Amazon was quick and easy. Thanks Amazon!
4,Confusing ending,"This movie is about a poor villager in a poor village trying to get into the Guinness book of records by riding a bicycle non-stop for almost 6 days. Along the way he becomes enamored of a pretty acrobat in a local circus. She spurns his advances because she's only interested in money. Near the end of the ride, she see's something in her Tarot cards that bodes badly for the cyclist's future, and tries to stop him, but she's not in time. When he reaches his goal, there's a big celebration in the town, but the cyclist collapses and is carried away from the crowds by his friend and trainer, accompanied by the acrobat. He appears to be dead, or maybe he's just too tired to respond. They raise him into the air on a balloon, and he seems to be alive and responsive, if not awake. The movie ends, and leaves me confused as to what has happened or will happen in the future."
5,Exactly what a true fan expects!,"This is a must for all true fans! I have watched it 7 times in a row and can't get enough of it. It's almost like being part of making the album. If you ever wondered what the origional title of ""I Missed Again"" was, you will get a chance to hear a bit of the origional demo tapes. If you want to hear ""Hand in Hand"" being played backwards on a track of ""Tommorow Never Knows"" this is it! There is so much detail! Hugh Padgham, the Engineer, sits with Phil and plays back individual tracks from the original tapes...and they explain how it was done. Includes guitar by Eric Clapton and strings by Ravi Shankar! It even has a previously unrelaesed full length music video of ""If Leaving Me is Easy"" as well as a clip of Phil at the piano doing ""Plaese Don't Ask""...so emotional he almost cries! If you want the standard music videos watch VH1. If you want to really know how one of the greatest albums of the 20th Century was put together, GET THIS DVD!"
3,Little Music,If you are looking to find out all about Phil Collins and how he became a star then this is what you want. If you buy this DVD hoping to be treated to a great concert then absolutely forget Face Value
4,A Classic Album,"This DVD is another in the Classic Album Collection Series 2. Made in 1999 and including interviews with band members who helped make the album into the hit is was. Phil Collins is my hero , but dont be fooled this is a quality doco.Covering most of the songs from the album and one that ended up as a Genesis track written originally for Face Value.This version includes a great version of If Leaving Me is Easy which was cut from a live concert in Dallas 1995. Phil spends some time explaining how tracks got made , how musicians were chosen to play and has some rare home video footage. The closing sequence is the drum part to In the Air live in Paris 1997. A classic album and a must have for any Phil Collins fan."
1,This isn't what you think!,"Beware! This is only a documentary. While the product description implies that songs are ""included"", no complete song is performed on this DVD. Don't expect, as I did, that this is a compilation of music video performances of the songs on the great album of the same name. It's interesting for Phil Collins devotees, but does not really contain uninterrupted performances of the music."
3,Not my cuppa tea!,ANOTHER documentry type dvd...shame really.... forget this one....more talking than music content!
1,"This poster is NOT 11""x17""!!","I had an 11""x17"" picture frame that I wanted to hang on my wall so I ordered this poster to put in the frame. I was very disappointed when the poster arrived and I discovered that the real measurements of this poster are 13""x19"". I now longer can use this poster for my frame so I am pretty annoyed."
5,beautiful,This book is one of my favorites. I keep it next to my bed and pick it up whenever I'm feeling down (and even when I'm not). No matter what kind of day I'm having there's always something in it that I can relate to and makes me feel better. No matter how bad I feel I always end up hopeful when I read from this.
1,Overly simplistic and inane,I found this book to be a patchwork of genreric Eastern philosophy attempting to bring solace and hope. I say attempt because I found its teaching rather inane and certainly too simple to worth practicing. Avoid and seek out better enlightenment. This is a case of you get what you pay for.
2,Seriously overrated.,A nice little book filled with overworked and obvious little sayings. Enlightenment for 10 year olds.
1,Terrible,Item sucks lasted about three months and seems came open and started leaking exhaust fumes and making noise....Don't buy it.
2,Dull and colorless,"I did not find it interesting, what I had been looking for (some information about the people there I was looking for) and for a book of Architecture and Gardens, I would have liked some of the pictures to have some color. I will be returning it."
5,Roy Orbison Definitive Collection,"Track Listings:1. Oh, Pretty Woman2. Running Scared3. Falling4. Love Hurts5. Mean Woman Blues6. I Can't Stop Loving You7. The Crowd8. Blue Bayou9. Borne On The Wind10. Lana11. Only The Lonely (Know The Way I Feel)12. It's Over13. Crying14. Pretty Paper15. All I Have To Do Is Dream16. Dream Babe (How Long Must I Dream)17. Blue Angel18. Working For The Man19. Candy Man20. In Dreams"
2,very confusing,"the track listing shows 2 disks, which is why i selected this item. i had it shipped to my mom for Christmas, and when she opened it, there was only one disk. going back to the item description i now see that it says ""1 audio disk"". however, now that the CD package has been opened, i have no recourse with Amazon. caveat emptor. webmaster? grrrr, Amazon.....grrrr."
3,set your expectations correctly,"something that everyone should consider before a purchase of this class of lower-end ""camcorder"" ... you get what you pay for. internally, these are essentially digital photo cameras that have had slight optimizations for digital video. they are not high-quality video recording devices with high-quality optics. don't expect your videos to look like the latest movie blockbuster.if that isn't acceptable, pay 3-4x more for a real camcorder. as for other models in this price range, read the reviews. they have the same complaints as you see here. not that the complaints aren't valid, it's just that you must consider what you're paying for.if you're looking for something that will record sometimes jerky, sometimes blurry, often poorly lit, but nonetheless endearing video of your kids birthday party, etc, then you're on the right track here."
1,Don't waste your time,I returned this camera after trying very hard to like. Picture quality (movie or still) is totally unacceptable. I did not even get one good still picture. Forget about indoors video or still. The falsh and video light are useless. The overall quality of the camera is low.
2,Documentary For Pavarotti Fans.,"I enjoyed this video the two times I've seen it but agree with Maltin that it is for Pavarotti fans and does lack depth as a documentary of western opera visiting the far east. The Chinese students were really a delight and it was fun seeing someone from China speaking fluent Italian! The occasion was taking Italian musicians/singers to perform La Boheme in China and Pavarotti singing in the Great Hall of the People in Bejing. If you are a Pavarotti fan, you'll really enjoy this video. Otherwise, it's probably a one time viewing for most people, even opera buffs. Refreshing that Chinese people, in the city at least, are familiar with western opera and like it. Seeing a short clip of Pavarotti perform in a Chinese opera was also a novelty. He travels with quite an entourage!"
2,watch out for splinters,Within 24 hours of use one side of the cedar split in half and fell to the floor. The vendor was good enough to send a replacement. The hangers do have a firm grip on pants which is great but they're pretty cheap quality and tend to splinter.
2,No win 7 support,"This items was awesome until it started crashing all sound devices when it was plugged in. Skype, Winamp, Windows itself, anything that played a sound would crash after using this speaker phone. There are comments that talk about getting this thing to work with windows 7 but they are for installing it only. Getting it installed is not a problem, keeping it running is. So now it is not used at all. Logitech needs to get off their butt and get some Win7 drivers for this because it is an awesome product and I would love to be able to actually use it."
1,Not so good,"Major issues with audio quality. Audio would cut in and out on skype and video conferencing. I tried installing different ways but was not stable enough to use. I tried on Vista, XP, and OSX."
2,"Would be nice, if it worked in Vista.","The QuickCall USB does NOT work with Windows Vista, and after talking with support, I was told that there are no plans to. Back to the store it went.Windows XP ONLY.UPDATE: QuickCall now does support Vista. At the time of originally writing this review (May 2007), there were no Vista drivers. Thanks!"
1,Does not work on Mac,"Since this product was only $13, I thought it would be worth a shot to see if this would work on the Mac. Unfortunately it doesn't work at all."
1,Surprisingly Bad,I was surprised that a product from Logitech could be so bad. It provides no echo cancellation whatsoever. This makes it worthless for any VoIP or videoconferencing applications. I returned the product.
1,Too many conflicts with my computers,This product would be great if they would create a software that didn't create conflicts with my operating systems. I have Win7 on one laptop and WinXP on my desktop. I had to disconnect this for good on both computers as it was causing my systems to crash! Blue screen and all! Searched for updated drivers for compatibility purposes and non to be found. Others also have posted issues with it as well.
5,Great Buy!!!,Works very well with Skype. We use it in our meetings on skype across 4 facilities. All four facilities have this and it is way easy to install and setup. Definitely saved me some bucks.
4,Works better in XP than Windows 7,"I bought this device when I was still using Windows XP and I thought is was great. When I went to Windows 7, I was disappointed to find that is really was not supported. The drivers work and it is fine with Skype, but the CallCentral application does not work on Windows 7 and the volume control and those buttons for mute, etc. do not work. However, I still like better that anything else I tried."
2,Didn't work very well on a Skype Call,"We bought one of these and tried it out on a Skype call. The remote Skype user was able to hear the conversation in the room quite well and the device picked up all parties around the table clearly. However, it was a bust when the remote user (who was using earphones and a microphone) tried to talk. The remote user heard very choppy audio during the time he was trying to talk and had to turn is receive volume off to avoid being distracted. It's sort of like you need a ""push to talk"" handset. I've concluded that this device doesn't do full duplex and does conversation ""turnaround"" very poorly. We are taking it back for a refund."
2,"Most often this device works, but often enough I get crackly or swirled sound.","This device works most of the time quite well. When it does get hung up, the sound quality is only enough to discern that someone is speaking to you; reconnecting the device sometimes corrects the issue. I didn't have these issues with WindowsXP, I do have issues with Windows Vista and Windows 7."
3,End of Life Product,Works well if you can get it to work in any OS other than Windows XP. OSX/Linux support from Logitech is non-existent.
4,Quickcall,"Nice internet speaker phone, large and well made but somewhat limited to the services it works with."
2,Great idea but no cigar,"I thought this was such a great idea. A completely hands free phone alternative. I use Skype for business calls and wanted a speakerphone so I can use the computer as I carry on a conversation. The problem is that it is extremely difficult to find a good balance between the microphone volume and speaker volume. People could not hear me clearly, I would cut in and out, or there would be an echo. All kinds of trouble. The only way to fix it was to purchase a headset which I plugged into the speakerphone, so now I use this set up instead of the speakerphone functionality. At least I found a work around without spending a lot of money on a new phone. But it would have been so much better if the speakerphone would have performed as advertised..."
2,Disappointed,When I received the fuel pump module I noticed it was covered in green dye (the kind they use to mark connections to make sure they don't miss anything). Looks like they spilled about half a can in the bag and didn't bother cleaning it up. While cleaning it to remove all the excess dye I discovered that the casing was cracked on the bottom. Not what I'd expect from a brand new part. Fortunately the casing was good on the old part so I just swapped them out. This is the only reason I went with 2 stars instead of 1. I don't think any of this had anything to do with Amazon so I will continue to shop there but I will not be purchasing anything more from this supplier.
4,This is good!,"No, this is power pop. Is it Big Star or Shoes, i.e. the best of the genre? No. But it is definitely a worthy additon to your power pop collection. Check out the allmusic review - I find it to be accurate."
3,POP WITH A LITTLE ROCK!!!!,"This cd could have been a little better i think.My favorite tracks are Say The Same For You,Plaything and All These Years.Say the same for you and plaything have got the rock feel for sure.I've got this on album actually.I got the album when i was like 9 or 10 and i'm 40 now."
2,This is NOT Power Pop,"I bought this when I read elsewhere that it was true Power Pop, and was excited that this band had elements of both the Rascals and the Raspberries in its personnel. But this sounds nothing like either--and it certainly isn't power pop. Cornish and Danelli, both of the Rascals, and Bryson, of the Raspberries, were not the primary singers or songwriters of their original bands, so assuming a new band with them in it would sound anything like their old bands is a big mistake. This music is tepid, very emblematic of the late seventies. Frankly, what I felt like I was hearing was a so-so imitation of The Little River Band, and that's not power pop, not even remotely. It's ""pop"" for certain, but very little power. It doesn't ROCK. Stick to the best of the best, the Beatles, of course, and those four Raspberries albums. Accept no substitutes!"
4,good all around kmk album,There have been beeter KMK albums but that being said this one is really good. Like most reviewers said they have changed their style to a more kingspade sound but thats not a bad thing. The beets are really good and the lyrics are good with the exception of D-Loc on most songs. Either he isnt putting as much effort into writing as he used to or he is running out of things to say. He has some good verses but about 50% of the time he is rambling about nothing.
1,Awful !,I just got this cd today. What a dissapointment. Do NOT get this album. I've owned all of KMK's cds and comparing this to Royal Highness or High Society is like comparing piss & vinegar to jack & coke.Get High Society - KMK's BEST album
1,I used to think...,"yea...i hate to be a negative jerk but i used to think Kottonmouth Kings were insanely talented...i was in love with their style of music, free thinkings spirits, and overall talent and love for their fans.. Ive progressively watched them turn their heads to fans and become more and more consistently commercial. its sad to me. this album is highly dissappointing from its repetitive lyrics ""yo wheres the weed at, tell me wheres the weed at??!!"" ..right down to its lack of flow, the worst being ""this my club song""... im not amazed that this album sucks though..they were better when they were freedom fighters and wild and free rather than LiL Jon wannabe's. Sorry to offend any fans reading this...i apologize..i WAS once a fan too."
3,Not bad for the kings.,"I have been a big fan since royal highness. After saint left the group i was worried. Then they dropped high society and i was blown away. The next was hidden stash 2, then rolling stoned which those three albums had the kings at the top of their game. The best beats the best raps everything was banging. The next release was fire it up very poor album in my opion. After that came no.7 a step up from fiu but still not quite there. With this release the have stepped back into the style that they are at their best in. A solid release for sure s step in the right direction. If your a fan of the older kings then this one is for you. Ive been down for the crown for years and will stay down with crown till im gone."
3,Some great standout tracks,"There is a mixture of some great songs and some really dull songs on this cdGood songs:Wheres the weed at - good fast paced song about weedKeep it Kali - Good slow chilled out song about there lifestyle in ""Kali""Bong Toke - Classic song about taking bong tokes. Slow and really stands out from the rest of the albumNeva Stop - Great fast paced song with some emotion into it. Great chorus. Its about how they are never gonna stopNo Regrets - Old school sounding song, like it should be on Hidden Stash 2. Slow but not chilled out slow. Its about how they live life to the fullestDo the Math - Best song on the cd in my opinion. Fast paced and a great beat. Daddy X really stands out on this one.Koast II Koast - Good slow chilled out song about all the past yearsParty - Great verses but very highschool sounding chorus - ""a party, a party, we're going to a party"""
3,Interesting social commentary,"The film seems to be about the film maker,rather than the music. If you are hoping to see and hear some of the great artists of our time you will be disappointed. Granted, there are great clips of Jimi Hendrix, the Doors, Jethro Tull, and a spine tingling rendition of ""Let it Be"" by Joan Baez, but this film is basicaly a documentary about the trials of putting on a music festival. Most of the music is used as a background to the concerts troubles, or as an artistic backdrop to the director's rather chaotic style. It's worth seeing more for it's social and historical perspective than it is for it's musical content."
4,Here's Why!!,"I could almost feel the corporate swine looking at the crowd and saying ""What revenue potential""!! Highlights include Kris Kristoferson spooked by the crowd,(""I think the're gonna shoot us!)and incendiary Townshend during ""Naked Eye"".Watch this video..You will have NO doubt about why ticket prices are $75 per seat today!"
2,Half a Song?,This release makes uneven performance cuts and ommisions. It is disappointing and should be amended with more material or released in a multi-disc and more complete version.
3,kinda disappointing,"Depending on whether your interest lies in viewing this as a historical document or as a concert video you will probably be either less or more disappointed.I was expecting something more similar to Woodstock in which you were able to see the artists entire performance instead of edited versions of the songs.I could have done with a lot less of disgruntled hippies and more music.Some of the performances were great(The Who,Moody Blues,Miles Davis,ELP,Jetro Tull).Others were mediocre,most notably The Doors.Even Hendrix was not as good as in days past.So much for the hippie utopian dream that was portrayed in the Woodstock movie."
2,Don't Buy this for the Music!,"While the label lists many great acts and many great songs, 85% of them are cut off less than half way through with footage of whiney hippies complaining about such a minor cause as a fence around the show! sheesh This is a great documentary to illustrate how immature the youth movement of the 60's was. The DVD is littered with stoners acting like a fence was the last vestige of freedom. All I kept thinking was ""show me the music""!If the music wasn't the point of the movie, why list the songs on the back of the DVD? Why immortalize the juvenile behavior of both audience and promoters (or ... if you must ... why charge for it)? Had I seen this hippie ""Bitchstock"" before buying ...I would have declined."
1,Don't buy this video,"Don't waste your time with this video. The best performances were cut down to nothing. This DVD my be worth 5 bucks, but I wouldn't pay more than that for it. Save your money and buy another movie."
3,Where is the rest of the concert?,"A good film about a sadly bad organized/guided concert, courtesy of Mr. Ricky and Co. One thing I can't understand about this sort of films about MUSIC festivals is that music sometimes is cut down to show the events that surround the concert. For instance Miles Davis appears just 2-3 minutes (!!!) with his 1970 line up; Jethro Tull is clearly edited; Emerson Lake and Palmer appear on the former Laser Disc edition just a couple of minutes, later the company added Rondo, but where is the rest... By the way once again the european DVD has more music than the USA one (where are Family and Taste second track)."
3,"the last, the largest, it could be better","For those of you who have seen the Woodstock movie, you loved it so much, you wanted to see what happened next, some new faces and not the least, Leonard Cohen, ELP first appearance, The Doors, it seems even better but the result is a bit dissapointing. The isle of Wight was more for the money than Woodstock. Some were kept out even if only one outta then of the crowd payed. We don't get the feeling that we're there with them as in Woodstock and the footage isn't as good but it is enjoyable, you can see some great performance, especially from Pete Townshend. If you don't have seen Woodstock, see this one first and then Woodstock, better keep the best for the end."
2,only 5 mins of Alvin Lee/Ten Years After!!??,"..whats all that about? I'm putting this crap on eBay first chance I get, I'm totally disgusted at the editing ,not because of how it was edited at the time of original release, but because they have not extended the songs to there original length . Ten Years After's 'I cant Keep from crying' with extended guitar solo from Alvin Lee, was nearly 20 minuites long and they put barely 5 minuites of it on here. This could have been made into an extended package, like most reissued/remastered concert footage has been . There is little enough footage of Ten Years After&Alvin Lee out there, yet Jethro Tull's full Isle of Wight 'full' 1 hour set has been released on DVD . Nice remastering, shame about the footage."
4,Isle of Wight,There are some great gems in this DVD. I purschased mostly for the Free performance since the complete Free Isle of Wight DVD has not been released. I was dissappointed with the very short clip of ELPs very first public appearance. I was impressed with Taste who I was unfamiliar with and I believe that was Rory Gallagher leading the band. All-in-all a good historic DVD with Jimi Hendrix and the Who.
3,Good But Not Great,"The film of the Isle of Wight festival is a good film as far as looking at the dying days of hippiedom. However, the main flaw I see in the film is the fact that many of the performances have been heavilly edited. Among the songs that you do not hear full length versions of are ""Rondo"" by Emerson, Lake and Palmer, ""I Can't Keep From Crying"" by Ten Years After and a blistering live rendition of ""Alright Now"" by Free. If you don't mind the heavy editing of these songs then I do recommend that you purchase this film."
2,Disappointing DVD,"I recently happened across this dvd & bought it despite the various negative aspects of the reviews. I wanted to see it because I was there for the full time in 1970 (my friends & I paid to get in). After viewing the dvd I have to say that Lerner's focus & the majority of the dvd doesn't nearly reflect my experience at the festival. While we were aware of some minor conflicts with the folks outside the festival grounds, it never affected us negatively. My memories are of great music, little sleep, great music, meeting fantastic people, the great music, altered states of awareness (it was 1970 after all) and great music. Unfortunately,this dvd doesn't show much of the reason most of us were there---THE MUSIC! Accuse me of rose-colored remembrances but Isle of Wight Festival was one of the most exciting & pleasurable events of my life & this dvd doesn't come close to reminding me of it."
3,bueno pero...,"la filamción de la bbc es impecable.Pero hay demasiados peros:se respira un mal ambiente en el festival con el tema de las entradas y la gente que no quiere pagar.Las actuaciones son cortas y muchas no duran ni 30 segundos.de todas formas hay que destacar a :the doors(the end),joni mitchel(woodstock),the who(naked eye),joan baez(let it be).en resumen esta mejor woodstock"
3,WHERES THE COMPLETE FOOTAGE?,"WHY PUSSYFOOT AROUND? WHERE THE HELL IS THE REST OF THE CONCERT? I ALWAYS READ IN BOOKS ABOUT HOW GREAT THE SETS WERE, BUT IN THIS CONCERT ITS ONLY 1 SONG FOR ELP, FREE, RORY, DOORS, THE WHO, ETC ETC.. I WANT TO PAY FOR THE WHOLE THING. WHAT THE HELL? DOES ANYONE KNOW IF THEY ARE GOING TO RELEASE AN ENTIRE CONCERT OF ISLE OF WIGHT????????? PLEASE TELL.... JRSPASSION@ MAILCITY.COM ~~~~THANK YOU."
5,greatest festival ever,This is documentation of the greatest festival of all time. It gives all sides of the festival. You will not be dissapointed when you buy this!
3,misleading,"Great Movie, but one thing is dramatically wrong.This was not Jim Morrison's last stage performance with the Doors. It was 12/12/70 in New Orleans. So for all of you who thought is was his last...sorry!"
4,book in bad shape,"the book is not in ""good"" condition--it is very worn out and has highlighting on every page. Other than that it was a smooth transaction."
3,Not bad for an attempt by British based artists.,"This is not as bad considering British based artists are new to the recording idiom. I have to disagree with the fan from Cardiff. Salsonica's contribution is by far the most original. The arrangements are outstanding and the production could equal any international recording; it is danceable and catchy, and the singing isn't bad either.It has been a massive hit in the clubs in London fan from Cardiff is obviously a novice. Roberto Pla's contribution is also worth a mention."
4,Pretty Good,"This was a very unique item. Fans of the series will enjoy it. At times some of the tracks seem out of place when out of the game, but that's more than made up for by the many powerful and classic tracks that these CD's have. The first CD is more techno-inspired while the second is more operatic. It's good music to do push-ups to or to drive to. Especially the first track of the first CD."
4,"Alex, my friend","Alex passed away 2 years ago and I was priveledged to have been a friend of his, a member of the art league with him, and an occassional student at the art school he began. He did many fine paintings tho unfortunately not all of his best are illustrated in the book. I would hope someday that his friends and compatriates could publish a comprehensive collection of all his beautiful work. His work is quite striking to see, especially on the backdrop of a show when you can see his style in contrast to other's. It is definitely reminiscent of the Great Masters, painting in the old style which not many artists have mastered in this modern era. He was a wonderful man, a good teacher, and a great artist and we all really miss him."
5,Couldn't put this book down because I kept getting answers..,"Michael McCann has packed lots of the most challenging issues that any married woman has with ""her man"" in an entertaining manner.My wife couldn't put this book down when she was reading it in the bedroom...I should know because her end table light stayed on for a couple of hours when I was trying to sleep. She kept poking me and telling me to listen to ""this one..."""
3,This is not a book about cross stitching,"There were some darkly crafty goings-on in the house in West Bloomfield Township, MI, just blocks from the Police Department. This is one of the most unsettling true-crime books I have read, expanding the horrific answer to the Shadow's question: ""Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men (and women?)"" This sadistic duo is right down there with Homolka/Bernardo. Carol mixes the unthinkable - sadistically torturing and murdering her best friend in the basement, with the mundane - going upstairs to wake up her young children and get them ready for the schoolbus.Author Fred Rozen unfortunately imitates Ann Rule: He keeps telling the reader how ""beautiful"" and ""handsome"" the perpetrators are. Read of their deeds, look at their pictures, and judge for yourself."
1,Dry and riddled with typos,"I had never heard of this case and was interested when I picked up the book. When I saw the massive size of the font on the pages, I wrongly assumed that it would be a quick read. I struggled to get through this story as Mr. Rosen, even for a true crime author, has done so little showing and all telling, that the prose was dry and hard to stay interested in. The editing and typographical errors meant the book contradicted itself in places. Not a satisfying read. I'm glad I only paid fifty cents for it."
2,"""Needle Work"" needs work...","I was disappointed in this book, although it had the potential to be a good book, it was spoiled by the author's style of writing. To me, it's almost like he's trying to revive the 1940s detective story in the first few chapters. I especially disliked the use of phrases like ""flashed the tin""--where the heck did that come from? It wrecks the author's credibility, makes him and the police look downright silly, makes light of the fact that a woman had died, and treats it all like it was a B movie or a cheap detective novel. Wait a minute, let me check...nope, it says ""true crime"" on the spine.... Though I must give credit where it's due, once you get past the first few chapters, it becomes more serious, realistic, and gets down to business."
4,John Boy and Billy Another Winner,"I can't remember a John Boy and Billy CD that doesn't pay for itself many times over with laughs. Rough Cuts is no exception and this one was priced ""good to go"" and the used CD arrived on time and in good shape. John Boy and Billy have been around for years and do a good job of protecting their ""intellectual property"" so I hope to collect them all. Rough Cuts is a nice addition to the library."
1,These guys are racist and homophobic,"I have listened to the JohnBoy and Billy radio show. Their humor is tasteless as well as racist and homophobic. They are so bad that they were banned from public television. Sadly, they have yet to be banned from radio and music stores. Don't buy this cd."
2,Napa Valley Style,"This is NOT a very good idea to buy if you are looking for decorating ideas. It was not at all what I was hoping it was going to be, if you are building or decorating this ""style"" of house."
3,Worth the money. A couple of good homes for inspiration,"OK, its not a home run, but its pretty good. If you are building a home in the tuscan or californian tradition, you will find some inspiration here. There are some great outdoor rooms as well. What it really makes you want to do is move to Napa!!! Great ideas for exterior details on tuscan homes and casual yet elegant structural details. Worth the money, get it."
2,Good cover photo,The photo on the cover and the home in the book is the only part of the book I enjoyed. The rest of the pictures were lacking. It has not been a book that draws me back to look some more.
2,Not a book on Discipleship,"Is hardly a book on discipleship. But more of an expose of modern christianity that is full of people who live in disobedience. Not a bad book, but I was looking for a book on discipleship. It is an overview of gospel doctrine. He thinks that by educating the lukewarm christians who may happen to read this book, they will change into disciples. How nave! It is not for lack of knowledge. This book can be retitled: A Survey of Today's Modern Lukewarm Christianity. He attempts to fix it by re-educating and defining the gospel, church, and discipleship in light of politics and history. This is an academic, history book, not Christian living."
3,Not again,"This book is disappointing. In my own estimation, it is simply another attempt by Brazos Press to define discipleship through the grid of pacifism. I guess this shouldn't be a surprise given the publisher's extreme preoccupation with Stanley Hauerwas. Lee Camp's proposition (sorry to offend you post-modern types) that Constantine and present day rulership in America are somehow similar is off-base. Last time I checked, Bush wasn't excuting people for not becoming Christian, and to confuse this with the issue of America's War on Terror or any other recently fought war is absurd.I'm not endorsing bad evangelical thinking, and I know there is plenty of it, I would simply like to see Rodney Clapp of Brazos Press give Paul as much attention as he does Jesus (also they've seemingly forgotten about the Christ of Revelation). I have yet to see a respectable treatment of Romans 13 from this division of Baker. If I'm not mistaken, the canonicity of Paul's epistle is part of our Christian heritage."
5,"THIS IS IN A WORD ""GREAT""","This is one of my all time favorite dvds. Gilmour's guitar playing is as good as Clapton. I know it is basically acoustic guitar but it is simply mind blowing work. Everything about this show is excellent. I love Pink Floyd and I sure am glad that I found this one. Roger Water's ""In The Flesh"" is still my favorite in this genre but this is a close second. Don't miss this one!!"
3,"Despite poor quality, still an interesting video","This video is split up into 3 parts: Part 1 A concert featuring mostly About Face songs but a couple Floyd with Nick Mason on drums for CN. The camera work is kind of cheap here but nonetheless I find it to be a much more intersting show than Delicate Sound of Thunder. Part 2 A couple of music videos for Blue Light and All Lovers.. Part 3 The reason I got this..entitled ""after the floyd"". it starts with Dave watching a TV with the Wall movie on it during ""ABITW II"" and then goes to interviews with Nick Mason, Pete Townshend, etc.All in all, it's for the diehard Floyd fan only."
3,Dissent with the High Ratings,"I don't agree with all the hype about this DVD. The concert seems flat. Selection of songs was fair. I don't think David put much effort into this. Dolby 5.1 is only for crowd noise. He didn't play that long. The only reason the DVD was longer is because they added music from another concert. When compared to Roger Waters ""In the Flesh"", (5 Stars), this DVD is poor. It appears Roger put much more work and effort into his concert."
2,A MASTER AT WORK,No whistles or bells here - just pure talent. To watch and more importantly hear David Gilmour is absolute pleasure. I wish I was there.
4,where is pinkfloyd in 2003.?,"After several times watching my two favorite artists [ Dave from DVD""David gilmour in concert"" .and Rogers's ""In the flesh""].I have a feeling like a kid sitting in a midle of a divorced parents . both are so great, but wasted so much on something that nobody want to. Anyway, this DVD is a great one to have. It contents some amazing acoustic sounds that seems lightly opposition of ""Sound of thunder"" & "" Pulse"". Hopefully one days. we have the true, reunited Pink+Floyd. [ Just the HIGH HOPE?]."
4,incredible,"Forget any of the bad reviews. The ONLY reason I gave this 4 stars and not 5 was because I didn't want it to end!!!!I loved every second of it... I will admit the fact that the 2 guest singers read off of a piece of paper. Other then that I could not get enough. I've been listening to Floyd since about 1978 and love Gilmour's guitar. His guitar, his vocals and the song list are just incredible.After reading some of the other reviews I was a bit worried about what this might be like and I will tell you I am very glad I bought this. The ""spare digits"" feature alone was worth my money.. it was the first part I viewed... but once I watched the whole thing I couldn't wait to write this review to say........ if you don't like this then you just don't understand!!"
5,Gilmour does it again,"There is no denying the talent and profciency of David Gilmour as a guitarist and performer and through this DVD he proves it again.The concert is mostly played on acoustic guitar which sounds amazing considering that most of the Pink Floyd songs are just layers and layers of electric sounds and melodies.The stripped down version of Shine On You Crazy Diamond is brilliant.The choir backing Gilmour is amazing.I got goose bumps listening to the girl playing the celo, she added such a delicate and beautiful touch to High Hopes and Je Crois Entendre Encore.Special appearences from Richard Wright and Bob Geldof as well.Over all a mind blowing performance."
4,Still one of the best guitar players around!,"I found this dvd of David Gilmour to be a vital addition to my floyd collection.David still plays and sings just as well as he ever has!If you are looking for a heart pounding high energy concert in this dvd you may be disapointed,but if you enjoy a very well played and layed back concert from one of the greatest guitar players,from one of the greatest bands,THAN YOU WILL LOVE THIS ONE!!The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it left me wanting MORE!!as in another hour or two!"
4,Nice acoustic versions of Gilmour/Floyd classics,"David Gilmour does a fantastic job performing his classic material acoustically. I was amazed and impressed to hear him pull off ""Shine on you crazy diamond"" without the help of a full band. The stage setting is nice and the sound quality is top notch. If you like Pink Floyd and especially Gilmour, you will enjoy this disk."
1,Pretty grim,"I've loved Pink Floyd for years but don't expect to find anything but a very weak cry from the past on this DVD. I give it one star because Gilmour showed up but, beyond that, I can't think of anything redeeming to say about this DVD. If you're looking for Pink Floyd or even the David Gilmour of days gone by, you'll be sorely disappointed by this recording."
1,"milking the 1,000 uddered cow","floyd's 3rd and least effective frontman (barrett is 1st and waters is 2nd)once again trots out ""the hits"". after viewing this i have become un-comfortably numb..."
1,Another Pink Floyd dissappointment,This performance is mediocore. There is really nothing outstanding about it. Gilmour's own material is boring. His Floyd music is uninspiring. No real light show or special effects. Not worth the money.
1,The worst DVD I've ever bought,"Why can't people admit that they have bought something terrible? Four stars...five stars.....for this DVD? Didn't they seen Roger Waters ""Live in the Flesh""? It's not a shame. I bought something terrible too. The only star for this dvd is for the woman on the cello who did a great job!!!!!!"
2,Fat bloated grimacing has-been.,"I know I am gonna offend a lot of Gilmore fans, but let's face it, Roger Waters at least has been keeping physcially fit. The first thing that came to mind when I viewed this was, ""Gilmore has really let himself go."" It looks like he has spent his free time eating donuts, ice cream, pasta and McDonalds. And to add insult to injury, he plays wearing an old shabby t-shirt.I mean, if you are bloated and overweight, try to at least compensate and put on a decent shirt. It is painful looking at his grimace through his fat face. David, I respect your talents as a guitar God, but please get in shape or your gonna die early and not fully appreciate what you have accomplished in life."
5,"david gilmour in concert, DVD","Absoultely fantastic. Almost as good as being there, only withbetter seats. Truly a wonderful musician and timeless. His musicis soulful, and thought provoking. A MUST for David Gilmour fans and fans of Pink Floyd alike."
4,The legend continues,"I was a little hesitant on buying this dvd until I popped the dvd in and listened to it the first time. When I heard ""Shine on you Crazy diamond"" I was almost sadened by what I was hearing. I thought you gotta be crazy David, doing this to a Pink Floyd song but after you get past the first couple songs the album truely opens up. I personally start the dvd on the 4th track and the next 5 songs are pure bliss. Also, David uses the acoustic guitar on all the songs but does use an electric guitar as well for many of his solos (in which he just jams out as you would expect him to). At first I thought this was going to be a major disappointment but there are about 5 or 6 excellent songs on here which make it well worth the money. I bought this DVD 4 days ago and have already listened to it about 8 or 9 times."
4,Pink Floyd Unplugged,"For Pink Floyd and David Gilmour fans out there, a note of caution: this concert has no lasers, no pyrotechnics, and no giant inflatable pigs. In fact, there's just David Gilmour, his acoustic guitar, and a few musicians. Nevertheless, the scaled down sound works for this selection of Pink Floyd songs, some covers, and a (surprisingly) few Dave Gilmour solo pieces. The additional performers - a cellist, an oboist, a small choir, and a pianist, among others - help lend a fresh feeling to the old Floyd standards, but it's the covers and solo pieces such as ""Hushabye Mountain"" and ""Smile"" that really shine. ""Je Crois Entendre Encore,"" from a Bizet opera, and the Richard Wright song ""Breakthrough"" (featuring the artist himself on piano and vocals) are worth the price of the disc alone, but if you need more there are some good extras and bonus songs to add icing to the cake."
5,IGNORE THE ONE STAR REVIEWS THIS IS A CLASSIC,THIS IS A GREATDVD FROM DAVID GILMOUR AND IS VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.DISREGARD THE ONE STAR REVIEWS.
5,David Gilmour in Concert - Live at Robert W.s Meltdown,"I love it, specially ""Dimming Of The Day"" - besides that most the program is Pink Floyd unplugged. Only the windscreen on David's Vocalmike is awfull."
2,Not what you think it is...,"First - I love David Gilmour...and believe he was more the 'sound' of Pink Floyd than Roger. Upon reading reviews of this DVD ""David Gilmour in Concert 2002"", I bought it over the more expensive Royal Albert Hall DVD. Mistake. This one, though a quality performance, is not ""Pink Floyd re-visited"" and has ZERO songs from his first two solid albums from back in the 80s (David Gilmour and About Face). It is a bunch of slow, 'On an Island' type songs from I don't know where and multiple versions of PF songs that all began to sound the same... I had to fast forward several times. The redeeming feature of this DVD is the Extras. The DVD is 'only' $10, but I don't see myself ever watching it again so...not worth the money."
5,Great all around!,"I have had this concert since it came out and thought it would be great for a small father's day gift,even though i was late.It was indeed!David Gilmour is fantastic,the setlist awesome,the price was right and it got delivered in a few days.Great job!"
5,thank you,My husband is going to love this christmas present thank you so much for the prompt shipping.
3,More Gilmoure,"If you like Gilmoure, you won't be disappointed. This concert is more of a single, I want to do my thing concert. It works in a much different way. It's raw Gilmoure. Worth the money."
5,Amazing!,"I had seen clips of the concert on one of the music channels on satellite and I just had to have this DVD. Not being a big Pink Floyd fan or having any of the CDs, seeing the clips got me interested in perhaps giving the music a second chance. I kind of strayed away from the music because of the imagery of the movie ""The Wall"" and the psychedelic culture associated with it. But as I watched the DVD and saw David Gilmour with an ""older and wiser"" stage presence, I saw the music in a whole new light. From old standards like ""Comfortably Numb"" to an excellent orchestral version of ""High Hopes"", David Gilmour puts a whole new spin on the music that was popular in years past. This DVD is strongly recommended for people of all ages who enjoy wide ranges of taste in music. This is coming from a twenty something that gave it a second chance."
2,Too bad we can't pick our relatives,"The reviewer from GA has the plot description. In this book Lucius is a businessman and Katrina is a book illustrator. I find that I dislike Ms. Neels' stories when the nasty, and in this one the sister is nasty, relatives are catered to. Not only that but Katrina loves her despite the sister's selfishness. When I read Betty Neels' books with this type of relative I just want to scream. If that doesn't bother you, give it another star."
5,Betty Neels Books,"I love every book that I have read so far by this lady. The theme is mostly the same in each book, doctor with a nurse or a plain Jane, but the story is very good and just so pure and simple that it give the reader a good feeling for having read it. Just wish that they were all on Kindle."
3,Save your pennies for a new edition!,"I bought this looking for another source of nutritional info for the pregnant and breastfeeding moms I work with. I did see the 1990's publication date, but hoped that there would still be good info available. While the look back was entertaining and somewhat informational, unless you are wanting to do a comparison with the current information, this isn't worth the purchase. Save your pennies and get the most up-to-date book on breastfeeding you can."
1,Auto Parts Giant,"Do Not purchase from Auto parts giant Store. It took them almost a month to ship the item. It was not the original brand I ordered and in the end it was not even the correct item for my car. Now they will not return it because it is an Electrical item. Their customer service is terrible, the guys that work there do not care about you the customer!!! They practically laugh at you because they know there is nothing you can do about it."
4,Collectible -- not book,"The Univ. of South Carolina Press facsimile of the ""Trimalchio"" galleys is worth owning if you're a serious Fitzgerald junkie, and Bruccoli's comments are (as always) enlightening, but buy the Cambridge edition if you actually plan to read the text -- the pages are looseleaf and about 24 inches long (like the galleys, presumably), so it doesn't fit so well in a backpack or on a bookshelf."
5,Adult Milk Carton Costume,"The costume will be the hit of the party if your man is comical.... it is easy to move around, It is more of an adult man size but can be stuffed with paper for a smaller frame."
1,too big,I was so excited to get this item for halloween this year...unfortunately it was so big! my face doesn't poke out of it and I'm disappointed that I can't wear it!
3,It's okay,"Not as good as their Ultimate Destroyer album, better than the new abum Evil Power.It has some horsepower, but Carnage is a mostly forgettable record, no where near as awesome as some of their other stuff (i.e. Ultimate Destroyer). Still, it is better than their latest output (War Metal Battle Master and the regrettably named Evil Power). Lair of the Minotaur are a solid metal outfit overall, but their recorded work has a tendency to be hit or miss. This one is mostly a miss. To me, there are no standout tracks to be had here, just tiresome chugging with an occasional sweet riff.This is not a terrible album, nor is it essential."
4,Yummy!,"I bought this for my sister for christmas...she loved it, but was afraid she'd eat all of it at once, so she took the box to work. Within 1 hour, it was finished by all her interns!"
5,Stuck in the Greatest Idiocy Ever,"These are first hand accounts of men and women that lived through the first world war. It is all there--loyalty to your fellow soldiers, cowardice, indifferent heroism, terror, and the feeling of apartheid from home and family. The most striking rememberances I took from the book were the white feather incidents--where white feathers were given to soldiers out of uniform on leave in England by young women as a goad to get to the trenches."
2,Product review.,The author has other materials I have found better. This is not what I was expecting from this product. You can find more clear info.
3,Interesting video,"This video was made by Master Liang Shou Yu in conjuction with Dr. Yang. Although Dr. Yang is in the video the primary focus is Master Liang. Even though Master Liang is said to be highly skilled I felt that his and his student's demonstrations of the techniques were very ""airy-fairy"", demonstrating very little intensity and power."
2,"100% demonstration, 0% instruction.","Extremely disappointing. All most of the commentary is either introductory or theoretical. None of the commentary is done by the persons doing the demonstration. There are no pauses in the demonstration.If you are expecting something useful from Liang Shou-Yu, you will also be severely disappointed. He never speaks, and almost all of the demonstration is done by students. His only demonstration is of the matching routine.I gave it two stars instead of one, only because of the limited demonstration value. Unfortunately, I will now have to spend hundreds of hours going frame by frame in order to dissect the movements.And I'm sorry, but when you spend $40 buying a DVD, the ""you have to buy the book too"" excuse just doesn't fly."
3,Fun way to practice vocabulary,"This is a fun little book, an interesting way to test your vocabulary when you are bored with flashcards. If you enjoy crosswords and know some latin, this is the book for you! I found that the problems did not make the best use of latin, though, and I did not like the author's use of anagrams- it was sometimes difficult to tell when they were being used. Overall, I had fun with it, and I think it helped my vocabulary; it was certainly a nice change of pace from the usual bookwork. Still, I would recommend it only if you love crosswords."
2,"Too much word puzzle, not enough Latin","I was slightly disappointed by this book. I like to do regular crossword puzzles, and I love Latin! This book--in spite of the title--isn't really a crossword book, but rather a word puzzle book. It also plays with the Latin, using anagrams and little word twists. I think it would be a lot of fun for someone who just loves all different kinds of accrostics and other word puzzles, and also knows a little Latin. If the Latin is your thing, this isn't the book for you."
5,A Classic.,"This movie should be seen by everyone. The performances, the adaptation of the Scopes trial story, everything about this movie is just great."
1,Kinsler = Genius,Just kidding about the one star...Mr Kinsler is the greatest teacher alive and he writes like an intellectually superior Darwin...
2,This is NOT a Webkin,This was listed with all the Webkins.. It is NOT a webkin at all. It is just a stuffed animal.
4,cute,"smaller than i expected, but i love it, its the cutest and softest ferret stuffed animal that i've seen."
3,You get what you pay for,"The toy arrived with a hole in it, you get what you pay for! If it weren't for the hole I would have been very pleased. The ferret is adorable!"
5,AURO PLUSH FERRET,I ORDERED THIS FOR MY SON.WE HAVE 2 FERRETS.IT IS BEAUTIFUL AND I WILL HAVE TO ORDER ONE FOR MY SELF SOON.
5,Addorble,"My little one cant seem to put it down. Its very soft and feels silky, my older 17 yr old wanted to play with it also, lol....."
5,Ferret Rocks!,This ferret from Aurora is just the right size for travel or for just hanging around on the desk when doing homework.
5,Fixed it,I was having surging problems with my 1994 4.3L s10 blazer. This valve is the right size and fixed the problem instantly.
5,Great cd,noteworthy collection of songs by a great songwriter. and very well done album. have enjoyed J.J. Cale's music and singing for many years and this is a composition of some of his very best.
5,The Epitome of Comfort,"These shoes are the comfiest things in the world! I have the brown suede in 7.5, and I can't even begin to explain how much I love these shoes. I use them mostly for class and for running errands (two things that require plenty of walking), and my feet haven't hurt a bit. It's like they mold to your feet the more you use them. Also, these look great with pants, skirts dresses.. You name it.I've had mine for about a year now, and they look brand new. I've never gotten them wet though, but I think they'd hold up pretty well. If you're worried about that, you could try using a protecting spray on it. My only complain is that the laces sometimes get untied when I'm walking around, but that's nothing a double knot can't fix. :D"
5,Great for beginners who want it easy...,"If you want an easy introduction and you're short on time and energy, then this is a nice introduction that quickly gets you up to speed on some basics...don't expect to be given a difficult work-out here."
3,Interesting with lots of details,"This short interesting book gives insight into the day to day lives of scientists stationed in Antarctica as well as explaining some of the types of research that is done there. Overall, this is an excellent book. It only left me with one burning question - who on earth is Daniel?? This is not a good first choice if information is needed to write a report about the continent itself. But for additional information it is a wonderful choice."
2,Short Life Span,"I bought this to use for my video camera and cell phone charger. I was able to use it, very well, for about 3 weeks. Then one day I bumped it, not hard enough to even dis-lodge it from the cigarette lighter socket, then it quit never to work again. I replaced it with one from Radio Shack and bought the extended warranty. I have had no problems since! This is a good product and worth it's weight in gold, but buy one with an extended warranty."
2,Vector Inverter,Had for about 9 months. Worked fine to power a cell phone but then it started to smoke. NOt sure I would purchase another unit. Looking for a more powerful unit.
1,BAD PRODUCT,"I bought one of these and my mother bought one. Both of these smoked, hissed, and put out a noxious fume when used in our vehicles. One was used in my mother's Prius and I used mine in my Explorer. My mother was afraid that it had fried her computer, but luckily it did not. I'm so glad she warned me because I had bought it to charge my son's Nintendo DS in the car. This is a horrible product and it does NOT work."
3,"Once you listen, an obvious talent","It's a good CD, and she was obviously a talent, but because I'm not familiar with much of her work, the music did not 'grab' me. At least for right now, it's not a CD I would put on to listen to straight thru."
2,WEIRD!,"Ash, Misty, Brock, and Pikachu are invited to a party on a cruise ship. Cool, right? Not!It's a team rocket trap to steal their pokemon. It's another pokemon adveture."
1,Pokemon Sinks,"I like Pokemon but this book bombs it! This covers the Tv show as the first book and the third. Big whoop, Pokemon are talking. I suggest don't buy this book if you are in fifth grade or fourth."
2,"Copout ending, and only stimulation, not active engagement.","This is a review for the video. In conclusion, I agree with most of the other reviewers. However, I do declare that the video (and I presume the book as well) has a highly unsatisfying conclusion. West has written numerous volumes of Pokemon literature, and has made quite a bit of money. After reviewing some of the videos, I feel safe in saying that most of the material in the plot is a concoction of disappointing puns, a G-rated sense of adventure, all topped off with an American impersonation of Japanese culture. I'm glad to support any literature that encourages children to read, but after an episode like this one, I am questioning whether this material develops Any intelligence in children, or only prevents declination of an already low standard of aptitude."
2,Battery with NO ACID is no battery at all.,"I received a plastic container, with electrodes with the shape factor of a motorcycle battery. It was heavy with lead and lead oxide cathodes and anodes.I had no electrolyte.It did not come with Sulfuric acid at 1.25 sg.It did not come with any electrolyte, water or anything.Just try and buy sulfuric acid at your neighborhood hardware store. Or try and get some from a battery dealer, especially after buying that battery on line.A battery is a boat anchor if it has NO ACID."
3,"Not Bad, But Not Great","Bought these to attach a license plate to my rear windshield. They installed easily and stayed on the plate. Unfortunately, after about a month of our 90+ degree weather, they started to lose their grip on the windshield. I'd restick them and they'd put for a week or two, but then it would happen again."
1,Do Not Buy,"I bought these specifically to attach my license plate to the inside of my front windshield. The suction cups are made from hard plastic... how these are considered ""suction"", I don't know. I had a different set before these that were flexible and rubbery, and had a GI Joe grip that kept my license from falling off my front bumper (I gave them away as a birthday present to a good friend of mine). I've been looking for an alternative ever since, and I have to say, these Cruiser Accessories Suction cups are terrible. Look elsewhere."
3,Well-written romance with a peculiar conclusion,"I found the book well-written and well-researched in terms of historical authenticity. The most enjoyable aspects of the book for me were the vivid descriptions of the different circumstances of each girl's life and the skillful way the author described their romance coming together. However, once their love was consummated the plot took a very strange turn and I felt that the ending of the book was completely out of nowhere. Suddenly I felt like I was in this sort of 'lesbian separatist' fantasy from the 1990's. However, that may be some people's idea of a happy ending, so... yeah. And in terms of their relationship, it does have a happy ending."
3,Sadness in Cuban Music,"I bought this DVD after watching a live performance of Luis Frank and Soneros de Verdad in NY this last weekend - it was a blast! The performance was world-class and the ""yankee"" audience was hyped. While this DVD may have historical significance, it is nowhere close to exemplifying the joy and rhythm of Cuban music and the skills of this group of musicians. While the songs are classic and the individual performances technically excellent, there was no joy among the members of the orchestra nor any smiles among them. This was likely due to the health problems of Pio at that time, who is no longer with us. To make matters worse the audience, when shown, was not inspiring to the musicians and either deaf or simply uninterested. Luis Frank and the Soneros de Verdad are world-class performers and musicians. This DVD should not be viewed as a proper representation of their talents and their present work."
5,HIghly Recommended,"I have the original version of this book as well as the newly updated version and I have only praise for the reprint. Besides telling the wonderful story of a girl (the author Elizabeth Corbett) growing up at the historic Milwaukee Soldiers Home in the 1890s, it also is illustrated with historic photos of the various places mentioned as well as some of the old soldiers. I can not recommend this charming book highly enough and the reprint does Miss Corbett proud."
4,Swedish-retro stoner doom....??????,"There are so many ways to describe this stuff that I'm just going to call it what it is, ""Rock 'n Roll"", and this one is a rocker for sure. It's very 70's hard rock inspired with lots of jams. For some reason the Swedes seem to do this well and a lot because many of these bands seem to hail form Scandinavia somewhere (Sweden,Finland), although we have our share of ball busters as well, some of which I am going to mention. I honestly enjoy most of these bands so if you are a fan of Witchcraft, BigElf, Spiritual Beggars, Earthless, Kyuss,and so many others than this will not disappoint. Rock 'n Roll is NOT DEAD!!!"
2,Waste of money,"I must be crazy considering the other reviews, but I found this a total waste of money. We bought six of the DVD's and used three and only couple of times. Both my son and I find it boring. Yes, it is educational, but other than use of bright colors, I don't find it entertaining. I could not keep my son in front of the TV when I turned this on. To my opinion, even though this is separated into themes, you just get for the most part random words, makes you want to buy all of the DVD's. We ended up finding a free signing dictionary online and always looked up a word we needed and then tought our son. That worked great for us, his signing vocabulary was growing very fast. He could sign about 50 words after 2 months of learning. He was 15 months when we started. He is a two year old now and speaks very well, we don't sign as much anymore, but still find it handy. I just don't find these DVDs helpful very much, considering the price."
3,"Interesting, but a little dry","There were some interesting facts that were well explained by Henry Lee: what blood spatters can tell you, the difficulty of determining the time-of-death, and the importance of collecting evidence in a careful manner. Of the 5 cases examined, I was most interested in his treatment of the O.J. Simpson case. I used to have the opinion that O.J. got away with something, but after reading his account, I can understand why the jury would have reasonable doubt. The book got a little dry in parts, but was worth reading."
3,Dr Lee's Great but I won't buy from ... again.,"This is a very enlightening book.The cases are similar to those on CBS's ""CSI"" shows.I would recommend this book to those who enjoy these shows...."
5,Gravity and Vacuum,"I think that should have read ""no gravity (in the the vacuum of space)"". Sometimes they use shortcuts in editing. I hope this clears things up. Could an eminent scientist make this mistake, or just his literary editor?"
3,Maybe forensic science isn't all that interesting.,"I couldn't make it through the entire book. Sorry. Too much detail to keep my interest. Henry Lee made me realize that forensic investigation means spending hour after hour cataloging every speck in a crime scene when 99.99999% of the specks are probably irrelevant. Hey, I didn't want to be a crime scene investigator. But anyone who thinks they do should read this first. By the way, I'd rather see the profession portrayed this was rather than in the CSI television series, which is totally absurd."
3,"Interesting Subject, Poor Execution","The forensic science covered in Cracking Cases makes for very interesting reading. Dr. Lee covers such subjects as the handling and preservation of a crime scene, blood-spatter analysis, and DNA analysis.Though Dr. Lee is obviously one of the foremost scientists in his field, he is not a thrilling writer. He spends too much time on background issues of the 5 cases profiled here, and not enough time on the actual forensic issues. Also, his writing can become tedious, especially when he takes out time to shower praise on those who helped him with his cases.The coverage of the subjects is basic, and can be understood by anyone. And, despite the drawbacks, the book reads fairly quickly, especially if one is interested in this subject matter. Recommended for all those interested."
1,Confusion,"The quote attributed to the writer on pg. 9 (as pointed out by a previous reviewer) concerning gravity not existing in a vacuum begs so many questions, most notably, ""WHA!?!?"" If the writer is this confused concerning basic physics, how can his expert testimony in a courtroom be worth anything?"
3,Revision,"I would like to revise the evaluation I wrote yesterday. On further reflection, I think I was too harsh. The clumsy writing that so irritated me on first reading is spotty and, I suspect, related to the dual authorship of the book. The overdone praise of police, prosecutors, etc., should have been heavily edited by Prometheus Books. The editing was as inept as some of the writing. To be fair, the scientific sections were good and the sections on reasoning from evidence revealing. Three stars would be a more reasonable rating."
4,Kings of Convenience- Versus,"Think Everything But The Girl, but seriously without the girl. Think, an equated mix of acoustic based tracks with subtle electronica. Think Kings of Convenience- Versus. This album features some fresh remixes by the likes of Andy Votel, The Four Tet, Bamboo Soul and Royskopp the latter remixing the opening track ""I don't know what I can save you from"" reminiscent of Alison Moyet's ""Only You"". The songs are taken from the duo's album Quiet is the New Loud, however it seems that this album is getting more audience approval as a result of it's listening able factor. It is a perfect hybrid of relaxing yet upbeat tunes and melodies that will have you singing along and tapping your feet with this Norwegian duo, who are everything but Tracy Thorn."
3,Not the best done movie but still a must see.,"We knew about Mexico's bloodshed & Martyrdom of many lay + priests but the event is easy to forget somehow.We saw it with our kids: teaches history, church history, showcases the courage of many men/women & of course, Padre Pro and his family.Honestly, I will probably not see it again but am glad to support its production through my purchase plus I am grateful for what it taught my kids about LOVE.Spanish language - English subtitles"
2,Good straps,Got them in the mail today too bad they were open and already used still good straps kind of disappointed though
5,One of the best La Barranca albums,"This album left me with my mouth opened. The violins and cello arragements add a good *plus* to the album.""Denzura"" is an album where the *progressive* term applies 100%: The songs are written with such a feeling, and music is complex. I'd say that if you want to hear the most psychodelic part of La Barranca, this is The Album.If you liked Providencia or El Fluir, this is a must have.For any non-mexican, this is a great album to hear if you are interested in REAL rock made in México (not those others bands like Maná that fool the people by saying they play *rock* while they actually play pop)"
2,Sayman Salve date expired,This item was purchased in 2011 but when we received the item it had expired in 2009. It was right on the box. Bought 3 and they all said the same. This should atleast be stated in description. Be careful when you purchase an item that would have a date and ask.
3,Not the scent I remember from childhood,"Lux was the brand of bath soap I grew up with, but it disappeared from the U.S. market. When I found it at Amazon, I had hopes of once again indulging an old nostalgia for the scent of Lux, but the manufacturer changed the formula and the fragrance. Still, it's a decent product, so I'll use it, but I'm sorry it doesn't smell like it used to."
4,"Structural Equation Modeling With Eqs: Basic Concepts, Applications, And Programming (Multivariate Applications) (Multivariate A",The book is here and came in quickly.
5,WHEN WILL WE SEE YOU????,"The lady can chill.Beth Hirsch,one of my favorite singers,is on the of being BIG.She is forever being compared to Beth Orton or to Joni Mitchel.Her voice is much more sultry.Her music and lyrics while lacking some of the punch of Joni Mitchel is true to todays dilemmas and joys.""Idols and Titles""has the unique musical talents of Black Dog and Custom Blue.They present an interesting array of musical backgrounds-complimenting but never overpowering Ms Hirsch's soft melodic tones.The resuling album is a GEM.The only problem is she never tours.She should be great."
4,Beth Hirsch - Titles And Idols,"Beth Hirsch, folk chanteuse, dips once more into the electronic pool. Having previously worked with Bang Bang and Air, she now turns to The Black Dog and Bluesound to provide the atmosphere, and do they ever. The Black Dog help craft ""I Know Why"" into an enigmatic stunner, ""Nest Sensation"" into a sexily angular, ""Until I Met You"" into a romance with machines, and ""Who Said"" into a simple and gentle heartbreaker. Bluesound take a more traditional downtempo approach, but their results are no less impressive: ""Ordinary Life"" hums with quiet sadness, while ""Titles and Idols"" swirls around itself. ""Hindsight"" sings with beauty. An album that shows how limitless electronic music is and how well it complements different styles of music."
5,Absolutely fabulous.,"I won't try to add to the superlatives that the other reviewers have written. This has rapidly become one of my favorite albums. I do have to say that I think the author of the liner notes missed the joke on ""Can't Afford To Leave My Man."""
4,"Great performances, terrible mastering","Urania has butchered these precious old tapes--fine recordings, from the sounds of it--by aggressively de-hissing the entire program, resulting in overly dry, lifeless, slightly warbly sound.The issue date says 1999, a shock since I thought the record industry learned its lessons about dehissing in the early '90s. The back cover says ""ADD,"" as if they remixed and went to digital (the middle ""D"") instead of analog for a fresh master. In fact, these recordings are from acetates. If they'd had multi-track recordings to mix from they probably wouldn't have left the recordings in mono, and they wouldn't have had any excuse for dehissing in the first place.The music's great, though--the performances vibrant and incredibly ""together""--just don't expect much from the sonics when you buy."
3,Bought this book for my career library,"As a career management coach, wanted this book for my library. It has been helpful to me and several clients."
5,"Excellent addition to the ""Classic Albums"" series","I've never been a big fan of The Who but I do enjoy behind-the-scenes peeks at the creation of major projects, in this case the 1971 Who album ""Who's Next"". Not as much attention is paid to the album production itself as to the story behind Townshend's creative struggle to realize his ""Lifehouse"" theme, another concept that would entail an album and movie.The ""Lifehouse"" project ultimately fell by the wayside and ""Who's Next"" was what was left.Townshend, Roger Daltrey, and John Entwistle are all interviewed for this piece. There is a substantial amount of archive and performance footage of the band, as well as a few minutes of Townshend discussing and recreating the synthesizer sounds he created for the early parts of ""Baba O'Reilly"".Even if you are only a casual fan of The Who, I believe you will find plenty to enjoy on this DVD."
3,If you are a Who fanatic you'll dig it,"I'm a fan of the Classic Rock DVD series. The two best titles I have seen are the Fleetwood Mac ""Rumours"" and Elton John ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" titles. This installment about The Who's ""Who's Next"" album was a bit of a disappointment to me. It's more about the background of the album than the recording process as in the FM and EJ discs I mentioned earlier. Too much filler and too little insight to the actual recording of the album. I was very excited to get this item but rather let down after viewing it."
1,too much talking,"I was expecting to see the full songs in their glory. Instead, it was interrupted by boring old farts talking about the technical details of the songs. I was expecting to see baby o Riley, but all I kept getting was some prima donna messing things up. Why didn't they keep the chit-chat between the songs instead of during the songs. I liked the Join Together song on the top-of-the pops at the end becuase it was not interrupted. Sorry, but it was more frustrating than enjoyable. Who gives a toss about the background to the use of the synthesiser ? Let's just hear the songs !"
4,The turtle is a crowd pleaser!,"This is a great little toy. A friend got it ""by accident"" after she heard about my twins obsetion with peek-a-BLOCKS, but it was one of those GOOD mistakes! My 8 month olds have loved it since they were 6 months old. Its great for being able to put them in, and take them out. Soon my 3 year olds ""tought"" my 8 month olds how to make it work by pushing the head. It was fun for them, their first peek-a-round toy, which eventually lead to more, (just like peek-a-blocks we now have MANY peek-a-rounds and their playsets, the gumball machine, and the jungle)SO this was the first peek-a-round toy and my kids still enjoy playing with it now and then. The few gripes I have are that there is only one song, and it doesnt spin for too long, but it is still a great toy!"
2,twirlin whirlin turtle,"this toy is great, except for when my 6 month old had his hand inside (holding on to the lip) and the turtle head gets pushed down the balls went to the side and got his fingers stuck. his finger was purple and we had a hard time getting them out. otherwise i like it i just am not sure how safe it is. i am still keeping it for now and watching him careful with it,but if it happens again i am taking it back."
2,Didn't interest my 14 mth old,My then 14 mth old got this for Christmas last year and has barely played with it. He loves the balls but he loves any type of ball. It is cute but isn't very interesting.
3,"Fun, but very little replayability.","I highly enjoyed this game, but found that little changed if you choose a different Dimayo to play after finishing the first game. Still, I had fun and for the price I paid for the game, you can't beat it."
5,I Enjoy Throne of Darkness more than Dungeon Seige,"I haven't gotten back into my Dungeon Seige game yet since I started Throne of Darkness. Although it is not quite as easy to play as Dungeon Seige I enjoy it much more.As I am learning kenjutsu at my local dojo, I find the feudal Japanese setting and weapons much more interesting. It is even annoying in its realism - your weapons and armor have a durability factor and must be repaired or replaced frequently after battles.This rates near the top of my list of favorite video games of all time: along with Chrono Cross, Chrono Trigger, Dungeon Seige and Vanguard!"
1,Disappointed.,I bought this for my boyfriend and he never got to play it. The disk wasn't playable when it arrived.
3,So so.....,You move from one place to another (Zzzzzzz). The combat takes place too rapidly to interact with. I like the Japanese influence but gameplay is rather boring. You move your guys.. click on the enemy.. they kill them.. you move on. Whoopeee!You're really better off saving your money unless you really like Japanese stuff. I'll give it three stars because the graphics don't suck.
2,Boring,"Just another Diablo clone with a twist, you get a whole bunch of characters. You can teleport them in and out of your dojo to the battlefield so they can heal or fight. I just couldn't get into it. Played it a few times, then put it away."
1,Bring a book!,"Okay, perhaps I'm a tiny bit spoiled by having played all of the Baldur's Gate titles, expansions, etc., but I found this game to be really, REALLY slow. I often found myself reading while the daimyo healed my characters. The characters would be healed, then hacked to bits within 3 minutes, back to the daimyo to begin the cycle anew. Geez! I agree with a previous critique, the sorcerer is worthless. I do however, like the little dance he does when he dies! While creating new types of armor is slightly interesting, it really drags after a time.I recently saw that Amazon now has this title is cheaper than what I paid for it."
1,ratings,"I have NEVER played this game, but if you like your characters played by a computer and not have the ability to plan your battles, by all means get this game. I hated Dark Stone and Vampire because of this horrible feature and died repeatedly."
2,'Thin' Bracelet,"The 14K Yellow Gold Bracelet I ordered came on time and in perfect condition. The product itself however was not what I expected. The picture they give is a little deceiving. The bracelet, although is the stated 7 in., is very thin. I did keep it and will wear it at times even though you can bearly see it. I wouldn't recommend it."
4,Non-touristy things to do ...,"One of the enjoyable things about this book is that for the most part, they're all things to do and places to go that one has never heard of. I bought this book about 3/4 of the way through my stay of one year in Yokohama (just south of Tokyo), and I regret that I couldn't make more time to do more of the things in this book.If you're on a whirlwind tour of Tokyo and/or Japan, you can leave this book at home. But if you'll be in Tokyo for even a week or more, I highly recommend trying the tea ceremony, seeing some minka, meditation, going to a public bath, etc. These are activities many Japanese people don't know about or don't take the time to do often. Moreover, they're activities that very few tourists (read: gaijin) do, so it is more of an enjoyable experience in my opinion.Great book for those who enjoy places off the beaten path ..."
5,"An ""off the beaten track"", insightful book on Japan.","As an adventure tour operator we look for new information all the time - and this is one of the best travelling books I have ever come across - it is fun, informative, and slightly whacky at the same time. If you have never been to Japan it will inspire you to go - if you have been before it will bring back the memories and inspire you to return."
1,Do you speak Japanese -- if not DONT BUY IT!,Dont buy this book unless you are fluent in Japanese bc almost all of the activities involve some knowledge of Japanese. Even if an activity does not need Japanese most of the numbers no longer work! Forget his book -- get Frommers -- my bible!
3,Great cast,"Amazing acting. Pretty place, Suspended belief is essential. So many distinct characters seemed a little hard to wrap,and hence not to be thought about, but simply to feel and see."
2,Evening,Evening was a good movie. It was just a bit long and a bit depressing. The scenery and the acting were beauitful.
5,The 'Evening' of life...,"Get ready for a good cry. This story will pull at your heart as we experience an elderly woman's trip down memory lane, lamenting over lost love and missed opportunities. A single weekend changes the entire course of a young woman's life and she grapples with 'what might've been' during the 'evening' of her life. Haunted by the memories while on her death bed, she manages to find peace with her choices when an old friend helps her to see that she truly did live 'a good life', and that's the best anyone can hope for.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
3,Could of have been ALOT better...,"First off, period pieces are my favorite types of movies (i.e. Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, the Piano). And this film seemd to be right up my alley. Considering the all-star cast, I expected this movie to be alot better. The movie was very underdeveloped to me -- while watching the film, I felt there should have been more background information concerning the character's pasts and relationships. While the acting was great and the clothing was lovely to look at, there is something just absent from this movie, and I cannot quite put my finger on it... I am glad i rented it and did not buy it..."
3,"What Is Past, Present and Future?","When a movie is not presented in sequence, one has to be careful that the skipping from Past, Present and Future is clear and concise. In this movie, this is not always the case and , if not paying absolute attention, you can get lost very easily. This is the story of a woman who is dying who utters a man's name on her death bed that none of her daughters recognize. It is their curiosity as to just who this man is. If the movie just stayed with this theme, it could have had so much more merit than it did. However, there is the added factor of drugs and possible suggestions of hallucinations on the dying person's part to muddy up the story plus the added conflicts of the daughter's lives into the mix to really make this a very disjointed movie. It is an interesting film with very wellknown actresses in it whose abilities are sorely tested to keep the film on track. This is a movie worth seeing but it doesn't take any prizes."
1,Don't Waste An 'Evening' On This...,"Sure, a great cast. A great cast without a script, and actors that have zero chemistry, in their scenes together. One of the few films in recent memory where I can recall leaving a theater and hearing everyone complaining in unison, and they all said the same thing: NO STORY.(seriously, I could hear groans in the theater and exasperated sighs with every bit of dialogue that came out....we were bored stiff. I couldn't wait for it to be over. For all the hype over Vanessa Redgrave and Meryl together again? For five minutes, at the end of the film, in a scene that begged for beefing up and more words. I was certain Meryl's character showed up to smother Ms. Redgrave with a pillow, and get the whole thing over with."
2,I just don't buy it,"The only reason I'm giving this movie two stars instead of one is that it has potential and a good cast. I think the actors did all they could with the material they were given, the problem was...there wasn't much material to go on. What I had the hardest time with was the character Harris. He is the love interest of three of the characters, and thus central to the story but he has the personality of a door! It made everything else fall apart, which is sad because the story probably had something more potent to say.To end on a more positive note, I was pleasantly surprised by Hugh Dancy. He really made me feel for Buddy, and I still want to know what he was going to tell Ann."
2,Sappy,"The main reason I wanted to see this film in the first place is because of double mother/daughter casting (Redgrave/Richardson and Streep family). More that anything, I wanted to see showdown of acting abilities by a younger generation. While Natasha Richardson knows her place in the film industry and deserves her place next to her mother, I cannot say the same for the younger Streep. As you can tell, I do not even recall her first name. Other than her mother's likeness, her acting is bland. The plot itself is slow moving and multi-layered plot that probably works well in the novel fails in the movie miserably. To be fair, if you liked ""Notebook"" and other similar movies from the same genre, you would like this one too. If it was not for the (female) talent of the casting in this feature, it would be hard worth mentioning it. Good to see only if you wish to satisfy your own curiousity about the cast."
3,No chemistry - with anybody . . .,"I too wanted to love this movie! But from the get-go there was no chemistry, with anybody - especially between the central character, Ann and supposedly love of her life, Harris. Patrick Wilson as Harris was just painful to watch - he showed as much passion as a flounder. And Hugh Dancy just was not believable to me as a lost soul drunk. And I usually love Claire Danes - but she was just ok in this film. I think the best were Natasha Richardson, Toni Collette and Mamie Gummer. I gave three stars for them and the setting."
4,Evening,"My wife asked me to buy this movie to give to our sister-in-law. My wife loves the storyline and has watched this movie on tv so many times, she wanted to share it with a family member. It is one of my wife's favorite movies."
2,Seemed Unfinished,"On her deathbed, Ann (Vanessa Redgrave) reflects on her life through a series of flashbacks. What might she have changed? Her listening daughters wonder how much was true, and how much is drug-induced rambling, while dealing with difficult choices in their own lives.This movie has moments, and the premise (how much choices affect our lives and how much does it really matter in the end) is interesting, but we never really get to know the characters because it jumps around so much. I found the ending to be really disappointing...I'd have liked Ann to pass on some of her wisdom in last words to her daughters. The ending felt more to me as if the director looked at his watch and realized his two hours were up. Only two stars."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I purchased the said movie purely on reading about the storyline and thought it would be interesting.I started watching it on a DVD player while flying from one destination to another which was just over an hour's flight and only saw a small portion of it, so on arrival at home I proceeded to watch it all again and was fascinated from start to finish.Wonderful cast of actors and very well portrayed."
2,Disappointed Ending,I enjoyed it right up until the end. The end was so blunt and disappointing I don't recommend this as it is too long a movie to have an ending like it did.
1,Combo HD DVD and Standard DVD issue,"This two sided disc promises a HD and Standard DVD. When trying to play the HD side the disc could not load, I was able to load and play the standard side and loved the story. Great movie!"
3,very good condition,"For an old book, I had to look twice to make sure it was not a recent publication. Nope, it was old. But in remarkable condition & clean as a whistle. Impressed."
4,Supportive shoes,"I am a supinator, so I need a cushion shoe. These are very comfortable and give a good level of support without causing me to turn my feet over. I think they run a little wide, but it also feels good to have the room in my toe box. This is my second pair of these shoes, and they shipped free from Amazon."
4,"So Far, So Good","I bought these shoes because I was in dire need of new tennis shoes. Last time I bought a pair was about six years ago, and they were also Asics. So, I have to say, since they lasted me six years, I was extremely happy to find another pair. So far I think they're great. Wonder what the next six years will bring..."
1,"Lightweight, not quality","I paid good money for this product, but when I opened the box, it was lightweight plastic. Even the ""glass"" is plastic (clear acrylic). I have not put it up yet. I hate to slam USA-made products, but this one was just not up to snuff. I think it is going to be too flimsy to last, or to even try using. It will probably end up in my garage sale. Waste of money!"
