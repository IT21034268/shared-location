5,.....woah.....,"I just finished listening to Aenima about a half hour ago. This is trippy. I'm not sure what I listened to, but it was cool. I never knew what to expect. And the cover and subsequent interior freaked me out, but in a good way. For music that'll blow your mind, get this one."
4,Great Album,"Although not as good as Lateralus, this album is awesome. The popular tracks are probably the best ones. All powerful, with full viens, ready to explode! There is some filler in this album which is why I didn't give it 5/5. Definitely a good album to own. A bit different in style than Undertow and Opiate, which were more stright up edgey rock'n'roll. Aenima and Lateralus get less technical in the guitar work and get more artsy and moody."
5,"""I need more. Nothing seems to satisfy...""","Tool is an AMAZING band, and each and every one of their albums is an utter MASTERPIECE (you heard me). As the headliner says, I need more Tool, so I bought all of their albums. The only bad things about Tool and their albums are that Maynard James Keenan sometimes can hardly be heard over the background music, but with the incredible drums and guitars, that's hardly a problem.Buy all of their CDs, and listen to true works of art.Oh, and BTW, Kudos to Eggplant. His reviews are what got me onto Tool in the first place. Thanks a million, man!"
5,Tools Best,"This CD was undoubtedly the best one Tool had. I liked nearly every track on this CD and three of the songs on this disc were played regularly on radio stations during its release.While undertow really only gave us sober as a great tune,Aenima offered about 8 quality songs (I thought).Tool has not been able to duplicate it success since.If you enjoy tools style also check out Perfect Circle.The first album by them is a great one also but takes a few listen throughs to adjust to the more mellow style (well with most songs)."
5,Blood loss is no bad thing.,"Ahhhhh, Tool. The first time I heard this album was on a walkman, and, I'll be honest with you; It scared me. Not in a ""oops, I pooped my pants"" sorta way. More a ""CHRIST ON A BIKE WHAT THE HELL IS THIS!!!!!"" trip. Stinkfist brutalised me, and I gigled when I discovered that Maynard's voice could have existed at any point over the last 5000 years. It is ageless. Powerful yet soothing, I cannot convery the emotion, the succour in his thorax. Ahem. The rest of the album got me too, making me cry and laugh simultaneously. I really don't know what to say other than BUY THIS NOW. It is amazing, whatever genre of music you claim your own."
5,gets better with every listen,"This is one of the most fully-realized works that I have ever heard. Musically, Tool seems to be acutely aware of the traditional ""rules"" of the genre, because they break every one of them on this stellar event. As far above and beyond the rest of the pack as anything released in the last 10 years. I would say that this is the sound of the future, but more likely this is just the sound of the band - there is not a simple formula to extract and replicate their sound. While the darkness of the lyrics and the complexity of the music likely remove some listeners from the equation, this is what music should be - digested as a whole, this album is simply untouchable."
5,I have 2 things to say.,1. This is my personal favorite record of all time.2. People that write a review saying how they wasted their time with this album are complete idots. Why waste your time writing a review if just the music was a waste of your time?
4,my opinion,"I would like to make a announcement to all people who hate or love tool! First, yes i'm a fan of the band but that is not why i'm here. I'm here because if people do not like this band then why are they on this sight writing negatives. My opinion is that they are negative themselves and are jealous because there bands do not sound like them."
4,"man, i cant get enough of this cover","The first time i ever heard of this cd, i was when a friend of mine called it ""the best cd i own"" I dont think that this is the best cd i own, mainly because i own a lot of amazing cds, but i do think that it is incredible. If you heard Schism on the radio and liked it, you will like Aenima. I should warn you that it is a tad bit more hardcore and loud that the material on Lateralus, but that is why i like it. It would be hard for me to pick a favourite song on this album, because they are all so good in different ways. For example: Die Eier Von Satan is the most creepy (even though it is just a brownie recipe in german!) Hooker with a penis is the moist angry and so forth. If you are unsure about buying this cd, let me assure you that you will not be dissapointed! The cover art itself is guaranteed to give you hours of fun."
5,More than just an Album...,"While it is usual for most people to look for mosh-tastic thumping drumming and chugging riffs in metal albums, Aenima goes way beyond that clandestine view. This album is less music, more an experience that has to be heard to be believed. From the etheral opening to Stinkfist to the mind-bending epic of Third Eye, the album creates a mood that is rarely equalled on such an album. The guitar and bass work is delicate, tending almost towards ambience in places, and Maynard James Keenan's voice pierces into your brain like a drill, with intellectual and thought-provoking lyrics. Incredible."
5,can't wait for the new one,"tool is incredible, stunning, aureally they can't really be compared to anything else, Aenima is amazing it's uniqueness and message"
3,Bought it for 1 song,I bought it for Die eir von Satan. Thats the song that sonds like a hitler raly but its actually a cookie recipe for weed cookies.. I dont know about the rest of the album. Could really care less to be honest.
3,TOOL / aenima,"bought this CD for my husband who is a big metalhead & when asked if this is one you have & said not yet was happy when got late B day present & stated that this was on his to buy list also he,s heard most tracks on this liking title song due to the ( learn to swim ) referance in it reminds him of the can,t run w/big dogs then stay on the porch T shirt he has after listing to whole CD said this was a sick a*# CD & all metal fans should have one in thier stack if you a type o negative fan your luv this this sick lil puppy!"
3,A mixed bag,"I have to tell you, this CD takes a while to get used to. BUt once you do, you will see the good in this CD. Maynard's voice is unbelieveable, and songs like ""Eulogy"" and ""Stinkfist"" are just examples.But this CD has it's downs also. The music (guitar, bass, drums) is below average. Plus there are too many dumb interludes (A track full of static is just an example).I give this CD 3 1/2 stars. Try it before you buy it."
5,Best Album,Tool is the greatest band! Everything ties together very well and Maynard's voice is so suductive and emtional. It has so much feeling in it and it is the best music you will ever listen to!
5,If you don't give this 5 listen to it some more,"Music nowwadays is going to hell, al this crap about 'getting low' and 'shaking it like a salt shaker' is crap tool is a great band anf Maynard is a great vocalist ig you think they are ""too dark"" or ""too in depth"" for your likeing then don't listen to them but don't put them down while your listening to that other crap out there nowwadays that the artists who sing them don't even write. This cd is excellent and gives Lateralus a run for it's money it may take awhile for it to sink in but when it does you will understand why it deserves 5 stars"
5,Perfect,"There is only one way to describe an album such as this one, and it is perfect. To put Tool in a genre that includes lesser bands is sacreligious. They are all together something totally different and unseen before."
4,Tool kicks,"This is a great CD to get started liking tool with. I first got into tool after i saw A Perfect Circle with Nine Inch Nails(another [cool] band only slighty better than Tool). My dad had had Aenima and I ""borrowed"" it. I was blown away. I could not believe how ... cool it sounded. The songs are extremely hard and long. The CD's title track is one of the best on the album and is on the longer side. It's over six minutes long but it's totally worth it. But the coolest song on the album is ""Intermission"". Which is a little breather from the hard rock tone of the alubm so your head doesn't explode. The coolest line from the album is from ""Eulogy"" in which maynard says""You said you'd die for me the, why you were surprised when you heard your own eulogy"". That's great. A Great addition to any hard rock CD collection."
3,Good CD but Amazon sent a cracked case.,"CD arrived damaged which would normally not be a big deal. But the case has a special viewing feature.Tried contacting Amazon for a replacement, but was not easy to do. Basically had to send the one I got back and pay shipping. Not cool as why should I be penalized for a defective product.Anyway the music is still great."
3,Who cares,"i think tool fans need to accept that not everyone is gonna go ga-ga for tool. i've listened to tool and apc they're all right but to me cuz im not a fan it sounds like one long song. know one can tell me its cuz they're lyrics are to complicated and i have to digest they're songs. my favorite band is pink floyd(first time i tried to listen to shine on you crazy diamond i thought it sucked now i love it) so i know complicated kick ass lyrics and they really experimented in music like the beatles. im sure if i listend to this album a couple of times i'd like it cuz i like all types of music, but im pretty sure i'd wouldnt get pissed if someone said they suck. just cuz ppl dont like tool doesnt make them idiots who only like stuff like blink 182 and GC. maybe they were expecting more like a heavier led zep or pink floyd""et tu, brute?"""
1,Different does not mean better!,"Tool is WAY overrated, and nothing is original here. Tool borrows techniques that many other bands have already done, and tries to come up with music that is supposed to fool the listener into thinking the stuff is original and groundbreaking! That would be O.K., IF the music stood on it's own. Nine Inch Nails did the same thing, and look at them now. Their '15 minutes' is over... way over. Tool will prove to follow the same pattern. Here today, gone and forgotten tomorrow. You can fool some of the people some of the time, but..."
5,"Spine-tingling, Melodic, Poetic, and harsh. Great Album","After Opiate and Undertow, TOOL released this Album in 1996. Tool is a different band to say the least, with poetic lyrics and many adult references, they are the kind of band some narrow minded poeple are offended by. After listening to many of the tracks, I came to the conclusion that this a fantastic album, with a spine-tingling metal ferocity that is unrivaled by any other band today, some songs start out slow but by the end turn into metal-filled barrages like Hooker W/a Penis, Jimmy, Eulogy, and Pushit. Maynard uses his voice more as an instrument then anything else, pushing the album to new hieghts. If you've never heard of TOOL, this is a great album to get started with. From its poetic lyrics to its harsh, eye-bulging metal expression this is one of the most original and deep albums I've ever heard. Give it a listen, and you shall be rewarded"
5,Maybe you should go back a few years...,"This is a great album, no doubt about it, but really, Undertow is so under-rated (no pun intended). There are under 20 reviews for that album, but almost 160 for this one. You must look deeper for true artists such as these 4 men."
5,Tool: Number One Band in the Land,"INCREDIBLE!!!!! This is the only word I can use to describe TOOL. I have seen them in concert a number of times and they are the only band that sounds better live than on their album. Plus, with Tool you can't really say you have a favorite song because every single song they sing is great. Most people see the outside appearance of Tool and think they are evil. B.S. They are just different, and thats good for a society that always seems to comform to what everyone else is doing. Give TOOL a try and I think you will see why I enjoy this band so much. The more you listen to Tool, I guarantee you the more they stick to you."
2,"A couple OK songs, but too artsy for me","I bought this on the recommendation of a friend, and I wish I would have borrowed it from him first. I will admit, there are 2 or 3 good songs on here, but even those are too artsy and weird, and it isn't an organic weird, it sounds forced. I think, personally, that if you don't like at least 75% of a CD within the first couple of listens, it isn't worth it. I've listened to this about 100 times trying to let it grow on me, but I still think it is not that good."
2,Come on it's not THAT great.............,"There's GOT to be someone out there that doesn't like this band. Aenima has two good songs - Die Eire Von Satan and Stinkfist. The rest of it is average heavy radio grunge, nothing more. These guys are out to shock rather than musically impress. To me, if you've heard one of their songs, you've heard 'em all. It amazes me that people consider these guys ""deep and emotionally moving"". I find them fairly one dimensional; a band like Mr. Bungle outclasses these guys in originality AND depth by light years. It also amazes me that people call this band ""metal"". Every song from Undertow and Aenima is the same riff played in a different time signature. Then again, this is the nineties, the only decade that's musically WORSE than the eighties. With so much garbage out there, no one from this unadventurous generation is motivated to explore groups that crush this sorry band and no one wants to."
2,Inconsistent and way overrated,"This is probably one of the most overrated albums of modern times. Tool are not bad musicians but they tend to make a mess of albums - and this is their biggest mess of their career. Of the 15 tracks only 8 are songs while the rest is senseless filler segments sandwiched in between songs.Aenima actually starts well and the first songs show some progression from their debut. However the first filler starts on track 4 and here the album turns into an extremely difficult and frustrating experience. The other songs aren't as strong as you again struggle with more filler. Things pickup with ""jimmy"" and the title track before the entire album drowns in endless filler and noise.Had Tool stuck to the no-nonsence format of their debut we may have had a good album.Critics and fans will equate this to genious but these people are the first to be fooled by gimicks and concepts that often mask musical blandness."
5,One of the best rock cd's ever made...,"I regard this cd along with Nirvana's 'Nevermind', Marilyn Manson's 'Antichrist Superstar', and Nine Inch Nails' 'Downward Spiral' as being one of the best rock cd's ever created. Every sound is beautifully placed, making one of the darkest, most amazingly harmonic walls of sound ever built. Almost a modern day, darker version of 'The Wall' created with odd, yet meaningful intermissions between the songs. Every person in this band is exceptionally talented. Maynard, of course, has an amazing voice, backed by one of the best drummers and bass players alive. Truly a masterpeice, and i would reccomend to any person who likes the darker side of rock and roll."
5,Who is the Pink Floyd of our generation? The reviewer below me asks,"Radiohead.Aenima and Tool are both great though, sure you can disagree with this review, but it's fact.For all you people who say Tool is the Pink Floyd of our generation, have you even heard 'Kid A' once? I own all of Pink Floyds albums, and there is much more similarites with them and Radiohead than them and Tool."
4,Best hard-rock band today?,"Perhaps the best hard-rock band today, all of their albums to date play like a pretty respectable ""Greatest Hits"" , churning out one 4-star rocker after another, interupted by only the occassional 5-star doozie. Hall of Fame sure-shots, making all of their albums almost mandatory purchases. Yeah, that good!"
5,Opinions Don't Fall Here,This is a masterpiece of art. If you really don't feel this than your taste buds are roasted. There is nothing close to this. Nothing so save your agruements. Listen to it over and over you might grow your buds back. This is all fact by the way. For fully developed brains only.
5,"Not just ""heavy metal""","Though I agree that the musical quality of this album is phenominal and actually inspired me to pick up the bass, it must be said that this is not just some hard-rocking, head-banging orgy of instruments. Everytime I listen to this album I pick up something new. It is something of an aural illustration of Jungian theory, traveling from the ego through the shadow, toying with the anima, and finally discovering the self. This is intellectual poetry juxtaposed with riveting riffs, unforgetable tonality, and extraordinarily intricate drumwork. Aenima leaves nothing to be desired save a few reference books on the unconscious mind and a heavy discussion on choosing to accept what's found in the shadow."
5,How could you possibly doubt tool?,"I've been a tool fan since right day Aenima came out. I was like 8 at the time and i stole the cd from my dad. Since then Maynard has been my idol ever since, with his warped in-depth lyrics, the solid rythum in EVERY song, and obscure artsy aura that surrounds maynard. I can't say aenima is my favorite tool album, but only because i love every album, every song just as much as the next one. Tool is my all-time favorite band. But i'm also not some stupid kid who says ""I love tool so you should love tool"". But i will say ""You like metal, but you dont like tool. Give me one good reason why not."" Every one has their right to like differnt music, but if you honestly call youself a head-banger you have to at least respect tool for what they are."
5,This Is Good Music Right Here,"Tool is one of the best bands that gave metal a darker feel to it. This CD proves it. Maynard James Keenan's vocals can creep even grown men out with this sick release. ""Aenema"" will give you chills down your spine. ""Stinkfist"" is also a classic. ""H"", you can't go wrong with that song. ""46 and 2"", also a classic. Other great songs are ""Jimmy"", ""Hooker With A Penis"", ""Eulogy""...the whole damn album is good! Pick it up at your local record store, as you can't find it for download on Napster or iTunes."
5,Music for the mind definitley.,"Tool are a band that has a very unique sound, extremely unique.Not only is it unique, its interesting, the musicianship is flawless and very detailed.The good thing about Tools music is that it opens up your eyes for what music can be. Tools songs are'nt just usual songs. They take detours in sound, build ups and stop start thrashes of guitars.While the actual songs on this record are all good, it is quite annoying to have a record like this with so many interludes of noises and static etc.Surely interludes of interesting instrumentals or electronic sounds that keep your ears open would have made this record alot better than it is.In other words - ""It should be about the music!!!""But the standout tracks make up for it.Tool is'nt Metal.I'd like to call it physcodallic experimental thrash/hard rock if I may.This is some of the most interesting music you will hear."
5,The greatest CD of all time.,"When I bought this CD I had only listen to one of the songs that was on it, and was some what worried that I wouldn't like the album. After I had listened to the entire CD I was moved. The songs on this CD are all enchanting. The lyrics actually say something unlike most songs today which just consist of a few verying love themes. This entire album rocks in fresh style that only Tool has. This CD has been in my CD player for over a year now and I am not tired of it yet. If you like rock you must buy this CD."
4,Original,"mike ellis, what you need is someone strong to guide you, like me. I'll open your eyes and blind you with my light, let me lay my holy hand upon you. you were born deaf and blinded and born to follow. thats cool mike, but dont bash tool, you'll surely go to hell.anyways aenima is second only to opiate which is an awsome and rhythmical album above godly standards. if you prefer angry music pick opiate and undertow, if you want something a little more meaningful than mike here, pick aenima."
5,TooLs best CD,"This is my favorite tool album. I like most of the songs except the filler tracks (with an exception of ""Intermission""). This is one of my favorite CDs and I recomend it to anyone who likes real music (not limp bizkit).Favorite songs: ""Eulogy"",""46 and 2"",""Aenima"",""Stinkfist"".PEACE"
4,"the actually songs deserve 4.5 stars, but the filler shouldn't have been on here","tool fans suck. they take everything i hate about prog AND pop and combine to make this uber-annoying person that i picture as a early 70's looking version of peter gabriel that shops at hot topic. imagine gabriel with that stupid reverse mohawk trying to convince you that KMFDM is actually a good band.i really wonder if all the people that gave this 5 stars actually listen to all of those annoying tracks that aren't songs every single time. i get it, but as they're completely seperate entities from the actual songs themselves they were made to be skipped. which i do. if i didn't have to skip them this would be 5 stars."
5,Stay away!,"STAY AWAY from this product of sheer genius, it's highly addictive!!! There should be a health warning on this, not a crappy warning against ""explicit lyrics"". What is that anyway? Ever watch MTV these days? No, me neither. Bummer, could've told you about the you-know-what ""artists"" showing y'all how to you-know-what fully dressed and in groups...Back to ""Aenima"": bought it the day it came out and it still is my favorite album. Maybe it's my ONLY album? Uhhhmmm, nope. Hardly."
5,Breakthrough in music history,"WOW!! What more is there to say about this album. Solid the whole way through never puts you down for one second. Great combination of lyrics and instruments.This cd has taken rock to another level, a level in which most bands will never reach. The guitar will leave your heart pumping while the drums will get you out of your seat and then of course, MJK's screams and sings his way into your head. Awesome cd cant put it down since the day i bought it in 96.TOOL ROCKS!"
5,Uncomparable,"TOOL is undeniably one of the best bands of our time. i could not believe seeing these 1-star reviews... TOOL is not for all people including metalheads because it uses more abstract lyrics and the complaints i have heard is that the introduction to some songs are too long as well. This cd is arguably TOOL's best release up to date. Some of these songs grew on me immediatly ,and some i found growing on me even a year after buying the album... try reading some lyrics, the songs do make alot more sense... those who say TOOL is not hard must listen to that incoherent death metal that i cant even understand. Maynard's voice is an extremely unique, and melodic and i cannot of anyone who could ever possibly replace him. this cd is definetly in my top 10 of all time. i reccomend this to anyone who LISTENS to rock music"
5,Best Album of all-time.,"Nothing will ever be better than CD. Nothing can ever eclipse, not in a million years. This album is so grand, not even the sun nor the moon could eclipse it. Screw discussing the experimental portions or the segue tracks or the fact that all the guys in the band are extremely talented (which they most certainly are), just realize how GOOD this album is. It has unbelievable amounts of energy, emotion, technical work,, emotion, intelligence, beauty, etc. If I had to have one CD to listen to until the day I died, it would be nima. Without a thought. Without a doubt. BUY THIS NOW OR LOSE OUT!"
3,weird and depressing...,"...but strangely enticing if you're in the mood - or you're a juvenile deliquent. Either way, like all of Tool's work, this album hardly differs from its predecessors in the elaborately constructed shock value that's demonstated through dark and troubling lyrics. Shall we say Keenan has issues? One glance at this and previous albums can answer that question. However, it's interesting to note that with each successive release the central message seems to be getting increasingly lighter and even a bit positive. Has Keenan found the light? Not with this album. Try Lateralus for evidence of that."
3,Good but overrated,"I think Lateralus is much more intelligent, complex, mature and beautiful than Aenima."
3,Too much gibberish,"There is some good material on this album, the actual songs are pretty good, but there is a lot of tracks that are just nothing. Some rants in German, babies crying, although it was supposed to add to the overall mood of the album, they could've been done without. The lyrics and vocals are good and the drumming is excellent, which is a standard for tool albums. Don't complain that this album is bleak and depressing, thats how its supposed to be. This album has its moments, but they are far and few between."
4,Aenima doesn't touch the brillance of Lateralus.,"Nevertheless, this cd still kicks major a**. Tool is one of the few respectable bands out right now in the current music scene, so you owe it to yourself to listen to them if you enjoy rock music. I do recommend you buy this and Lateralus, but I would pick Lateralus over this any day. This is still an great album, however, it suffers from some muddy production. Overall though, this cd is a must own for Tool fans, and it was even better for it's time. Go out and buy this and their newest album, Lateralus, you won't regret it."
5,I sent more money.,"I can really respect a band that cares more about their messages than their music. You can instantly hear that Tool is angry, but these four are angry for very good reasons. Just open your ears, your mind, and you heart and you'll begin to feel it. Think about the feeling and understand it. Understand it and go on with it. Do it... and there you go. Tool is all about being your own person, building upon what others have built for you but all the while looking at The World (and the non-existant) with an open, experienced, but not grudgeful mind.Buy this CD (or ""Lateralus"") if you're ready for SOME kind of change in the world, even if it is only one person being different. Join the revolution of the mind."
5,Yet another style of album for the always expanding band,"This album, like all of their other works, presents songs that also posess a very literary quality to them. In this albumn for instance, the song 46&2 represents a yearning to change into something better, something that could have been. Tool has to be one of the best bands that use not only the lyrics tell the story, but the music as well. I just hope they come to Pittsburgh on their tourBill Hicks, another dead hero"
5,Still one of the best....,"When I first bought this album about 4 years ago I despised it. I tried and tried to get into but couldn't. Then recently Lateralus came out and it quickly became my favorite cd. So I came across this in my collection and gave it another chance.It only took one listen to get hooked this time. The minute Eulogy was over I said ""Damn what the hell was I thinking not liking this album before?"" First the bad, I really don't like the filler in this album (Useful Idiot, (-) Ions etc..) they seem to take away the feel of the album. The only little skit that's listenable is Intermission, quirky and good that one is.Now with the good, the songs are jaw dropping amazing. All the actuall songs are great. There isn't one that I want to skip. I only wish they would've removed all the ... skits and put in a couple more songs. If I had to choose a favorite song it would have to be H. The lyrics are some of the best I've ever heard."
5,genious and divine,"I cant explain the impact this album had on me. The more i listened to it over the years, the more layers unfolded. On the surface, every track is listenable with strong textures and rhythms. The subject of the lyrics are kept subtle while Keenan treats his voice as a compliment to the instrumentation. I learned alot about music as a teenager just from listening to Aenima. Colors, dynamics, brilliant organic form, and raw emotion are the essence of this album. A true classic and belongs in everyones music collection."
5,Tool just plain ROCKS!!!,"I never liked any hard metal until hearing Tool, and I love all the songs on this CD, even the tracks that aren't songs. Although it might not seem like it, I found some deeper meaning to some of the songs I love."
1,Worst Album Ever,"...a tuneless, self-pitying, white-noisy, and completely pointless piece of wankery."
1,Overrated,"I bought this album, having listened to so many people rave about it, and to be honest, I wasted money I could have flushed down the toilet.Just another overplayed, overrated band, that has nothing new to bring to the table."
5,$price of CD$ times the number of years you live=aenima cost,This is the 4th time I have purchased this CD. They need to come out with an indestructable version of this album. I take very good care of my CDs but I have worn this out yet again. I have heard this CD over and over and at any given time I can pop it in and not get sick of it. This is undeniably THE masterpeice of the 90s. Recent studys show that listening to Tool's Aenima can actually improve your IQ. Rumors report that Maynard includes subliminal messages in this CD that make you want to listen to it over and over again. Statistics state that 47.2% of the people that have purchased this album have purchased it more than once....hmmmmm conspiracy? Can Justin Timberlake hold a note/scream for 30+ seconds? Maybe someone should clue in TRL...
5,Amazing,"Extremely high quality colored vinyl. Silent (unlike many other tool vinyls i own). I am speaking of the quality of the vinyl, the content does not need any explanation."
2,not for the tool fan,"this album is pretty boring. paul, the old bass player, is gone, so the heaviness and intensity of opiate and undertow are sadly lacking, replaced by a more commercial, acceptable sound."
2,"Very frustrating, pointless rock. WAY overrated.","I've heard many say that Tool is a great band, especially 'Aenima'. OK, my curiosity was finally peaked enough to go out and borrow this release, and listen to it 3 times. I guess it is a matter of personal taste, but I am with some of the previous reviewers who disliked it, even after a few listens. And I love hard rock and metal. Tool is a band that seems more concerned with creating sound effects with their instruments, as well as darker chord progressions. The end result is very dark and angry, but not musical nor groundbreaking in the least. If you really like good music, do NOT waste your money on this disc! It is indicative of how rock music has declined in quality over the decades."
2,not exactly their best album,"very disappointed. Undertow is still my favorite. This album is overplayed too much, because it is their first album in years."
3,NOT THAT GREAT! >:-{,"This CD just didn't do it for me. It pisses me off that I depended on all these other people's overall rating. Don't be a fool and be fooled. The only good song on this CD is the first one and maybe the title track, MAYBE. Just be careful what you choose. AND THERE'S TOO MANY LONG INTROS TO EVERY SONG!"
5,Ignore Nick Bertollo's review,"First of all, MTV has far from shoved Tool down anyone's throat. Second of all, you mentioned the only good reviews of this album were coming from kids, or ""sheep"" as you referred, well I am a major Tool fan & this is (in my opinion), one of the best albums ever recorded and I am a 32 y.o. female. In fact, every Tool fan that I know personally is over the age of 30 - and there are a lot of them. SO unless you have done your homework, and you know the facts, maybe you should stay far away from reviewing albums over the Internet. Don't quit your day job, that is, if you're old enough to be employed.With that said (heh heh) I strongly suggest all of you to at least give this album a chance. Listen to it twice, if you don't like it, put it away, give it a week & listen to it a third time at high volume while reading the lyrics. I can't imagine any serious rock fan being dissapointed."
4,Great,"TOOL is a great band, don't get me wrong, but I wish they would get with the program and release all their albums in MP3 format because I don't want to spend a bunch of money on CD's when I can just download it onto my computer and be done with it, that is my only complaint."
5,Which is the best Tool album? Too hard to decide.,"In my opinion, this and the magnificent Lateralus were 2 of the best albums put out in my lifetime. Naysayers need to take their complaints elsewhere. Yes, Tool is dark, complicated, and maybe even a little pretentious, but that's exactly what they set out to be. If you don't like these qualities, please don't rate them based on it."
2,eh.,"If your only interest in buying this book is info about show dogs, you're in good hands. If you're just looking for info about the dogs as pets, about half the book is relevant. Maybe. Well written and informative, but a little too rah-rah. The dogs seem to do everything but walk on water and heal the sick. There's definitley a void of information about health problems and downsides of owning one.Great for owner and showsters, but not for people looking for general information about a potential pet.Unless you're really into looking at pictures of canine orthodontia."
3,A fun read.,I do not agree with everything this author states. Overall I think this to be a well done book.
4,Invicta really needs to improve their manuals,"The chronograph ""consecutive times"" and ""intermediate time"" functions, as described in the instruction manual, do not work. Ether my watch is defective, or, which is more likely, the manual is incorrect, and this watch features only a simple start-stop-reset chronograph.The center sweep hand operates only in the chronograph mode. Otherwise it stays at the 12 o'clock position. This may give an impression that the watch has stopped, when in fact it still runs. Look at one of the little sub-dials instead.This is a battery-operated watch. It looks pretty good to me. This is my second Invicta, and so far I am satisfied."
3,Bodacious Friends,"All T&A - no plot. Each of the girls tells you about themselves, then they loose their clothes. Nice striping!"
4,Desperation and opressive anguish!,"Usually, we don't have the chance to feel with such level of crudeness, the unbearable reality that uses to happen in Africa. Claire Dennis shows us a film with certain documental atmosphere, the terrible destiny that awaits for a French family owner of a coffee plantation, who is surrounded more and more until levels of struggling, the intoxicating opression of a political regime, that practices the common game of populism in order to create expectations around thousand and thousand people who expect to improve their horrid social condition.Dennis handles with firm hand this harrowing script, plenty of compelling stress and tragic finale, when you are not capable to perceive the light at the end of the tunnel.Isabelle Huppert (an artistic French patrimony) as always, shines with radiant splendor in this formidable and certainly not easy to watch movie.Don't miss it."
3,Nightmare out of Africa,"A languid and slow paced film most likely to appeal to those with an interest in political/historical dramas. This one covers a violent conflict between wealthy French settlers and the indigenous peoples of a poverty-ridden African nation in the throes of a revolution for self-rule. Actually, neither side in this conflict is presented in a sympathetic way. But the movie itself will be of sufficient interest to viewers attuned to geopolitical changes and upheavals."
4,A poetic picture,"This film handily surpassed everything I saw this year--pure poetry in cinema. When a ragtag group of child soldiers emerges from the jungle brush to a melancholy jazz-like tune by Tindersticks, I could not help but think, These are the true Lost Boys. Shot for shot, Claire Denis' film blew me away with its composition. Rarely have I heard so much spoken in imagery alone. The only time the movie may have dragged for me was when there was dialogue."
1,This is NOT the Badlands w/Jake E. Lee,"I was surprised to find a new Badlands album -- only to discover that it is NOT the ""bluesy hard-rock"" band that I know and dig. I didn't even listen to the album: I opened it, saw a bunch of Swedish names and pictures of skinhead musicians -- definitely NOT Jake E. Lee -- and returned it! I don't know how this band is able to use the Badlands name, but if you're looking for Badlands w/Jake, this is NOT it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Too much varied subjects for such a small book!,"A group of Matemathical Researchers of several Universties of the World, disciples and friends of Professor James Serrin (one of the best developers of ""Rational Mechanics"" along with C. Truesdell, W. Noll, N.A. Toupin and R. S. Rivling just to mention a few), compiled some of their works in a book to honor Professor Serrin for his 65th birthday. Even when the book's content is interesting since deals with Nonlinear Analysis, it lacks the ""Classic Approach"" of the Continuum Mechanics that just Professor Serrin could impregnate to it. At the beggining of the book a list of J. Serrin's papers is shown as well as an unique paper of him at the end of the book which is not enough to me by considering the title of the book. Now I am aware that I misunderstood the second title of the book: ""Papers for the 65th Birthday of James Serrin"" which I thought it meant: ""Collected Papers for the 65th Birthday of James Serrin""."
1,Poorly Made,"After the first year or so of working well, we have had to send it back to L.A. several times at our cost for repairs and they never get it right! It may work for a month or so, then it is the same problem or a new one. It is too highly priced for the product that it is. I was told when I bought it that it was sterling silver, but in fact, it is not as confirmed by a local jeweler!!"
3,It's a guide for further reading,"This book contains reprints of articles on sewing. Each article is only 2 or 3 pages long, and that includes one or more photos or illustrations, so the result is not too much detail. Use this text as a guidebook--if you cannot grasp a particular skill--by reading this book--look elsewhere for more info., more detail, more illustrations--you'll know what to look for. Further, each writer is telling you how they do it. Yes, there alternatives to their way--like using a ruler and a ""French Curve"" when tracing patterns; you can buy some ""bias tape"" or you can make your own--stuff like that can only be gotten by reading everything you can get your hands on! That's if you had no one to show you how to sew."
3,Poor value,"There was little in here. An example on feet is 'use your instruction manual and experiment!"". Well if the machine came with an instruction I guess I would and somehow I did not buy this book to be told to use the manual. Instead I would recommend The Complete Guide to Machine Sewing (unfortunately Amazon has this has hard to get :-(, or Sewing 101.The one thing that this book did teach me was about pattern copying and it is very thoroughly indexed. Still nothing is very in depth and you can get this level of information from practically any source (Readers Digest Guide to Sewing)."
3,BEGINNER,I just think this book is a must-have for a beginning sewer. Very complete with excellent photos. Should be included in Home-Ec classes. Do they still have Home-Ec classes???
5,Its a battery - it works,"This is a battery that replaced my worn out Plantronics battery after several years of daily use. It was easy to replace and works. Holds a charge like it should and kept me from spending another $350+ for a new headset unit, well worth the $$ considering I am used to the headset and it works, so the logical step was getting the batter replaced."
3,"Good singing, but...","Despite the very good singers, this CD's are disappointing because of1 - The low technical quality of the recording,2 - The full recording of the very long and numerous interruptions for applause,3 - the absence of a libretto.Maurice Meneguzzi"
4,"No pros, no cons","It feels almost the same with the comic ""GS Migami"". The picture quality is good, the motion is smooth. The problem is - the plot does not suprise any person who is familiar with this type of story. Also, the music does not help much.If you have nothing else to do, it will be nice to watch this - and you can forget all of the contents the next day."
4,"Fun, if not fabulous, comedy/horror series","""Phantom Quest Corp"" is a great little series. There is nothing particularly original about it, nothing particularly outstanding. However, there are plenty of laughs, a nice soundtrack, and some decent stories. The animation is good quality, and the characters are fun. The stories represent the comedy/horror genre rather well.This DVD is a good value, and worth picking up. ""Phantom Quest Corp"" may not be the crown jewel of your anime collection, but it is a good thing to pop in around Halloween when you need a chuckle. Recommended."
3,Where's the rest?,"I love this series, and only wish there was more to it. I would rate it a 5 star if it weren't so short. Otherwise, it's great. If you don't mind being left hanging, then you should watch it."
3,Mindless Fun but not much else,"The DVD was entertaining, but I can't really say the characters pulled me in that much. Not enough background on any of them to make me care. Some of the fighting sequences and humor were good, but nothing really memorable. I doubt I'd watch this again.Although you can certainly do much worse thanPhantom Quest Corp - Perfect Collection, I'd recommendDevil Hunter Yohko Complete Collectioninstead. Yohko's family has a long history of fighting demons, you learn enough about the characters to like them and the battles and music are terrific."
4,Fun but more is needed,"I too bought this as it was [inexpensive] and sounded interesting. Loved it. It is too much like an appetiser, though.Something other reviews have not mentioned, is that the DVD is dual coded region 1 & 4. There is also another extra on the disc (I got to it by searching for track 3, but I'm sure there's another way). It is a 20 minute extra with introductions for the characters and ten minutes watching the (Japanese) voice actors at work and play. It's titled file 0!"
3,Phantom Quest Corp...,"I first saw this series when I was just getting interested in anime. I was browsing through Hollywood Video and it caught my eye. I figured ""What the heck. Might as well try it.""Phantom Quest Corp. isn't the BEST anime that I've seen, but it isn't the WORST. It is funny and I do like it. I don't care if other people say that it's the worst anime that they've ever seen. I liked it and I bought it.It does have its moments; but, then again, doesn't every anime have its moments as well?Phantom Quest isn't a type of anime that I would say an otaku MUST OWN. It's more of a 'if you like it, buy it' type anime. And so, once again: I liked it, so I bought it. ^_^"
4,"Don't Let The Name & Price Fool You, It's Good","Every now and again a good series gets released and goes relatively unnoticed. It's a shame, but Phantom Quest Corp will undoubtedly get passed up for a few reasons. First, the name (which is a literal Japanese translation) simply sounds dumb. Secondly, the price point it was released at makes it appear to be a b-grade title, which it certainly isn't.The set of stories that comprise Phantom Quest Corp are funny, whimsical and can withstand multiple viewings even if they are rather episodic. What complements the stories well are the great extra (omake) material and the animation. PQC's animation is crisp and detailed OAV quality work, not that cheap television-grade stuff. The quality and style of the work more or less gives this series its distinctive irreverent flavor.My only complaint is that, to the best of my knowledge, they never made any more PQC episodes. This is a great obscure title that I highly recommend."
5,Definitely Hilarious,"This show is definitaly one of the funniest anime series made in a while, yet one of the least known. It was only four episodes, yet each one had it's quarks to them, from an anemic vampire, to a group of greedy monks working to shut out the Corporation. The only thing to dislike is that it was only four 30 minutes episodes long. One can only hope that perhaps with the flood of TV series remake of older OAV series, the Phantom Quest Corporation could get some more of their oldball cases.Rating 13 and up: nudity, violence, sexual situations, and occasional profanity."
3,Wonderful Speculative History,"Colin weaves a vivid tapestry of the medieval turkish world. This story is an engaging story of a female slave using her wits and charms to survive and ultimately win the right as the Sultan's consort. Her mastery of political deception is diabolocal and her revenge sweet. Her son takes the throne but it was not of the Sultan's blood - thus ensuring the fall of the Ottoman Empire. This was all Colin's speculation, but who knows the truth may not be so removed from this afterall.Great & Wonderful."
2,What Happened on Kindle?,"I recently got this book on Kindle, and I admittedly don't understand how they digitize the books for this program, but I was shocked at how many typos and mistakes were riddled throughout this Kindle version. It was definitely to the point of distraction for me. I thought surely it was a one time thing, but when I got the follow-up, Seraglio, I think that it may have had more mistakes. Male/Female pronouns were wrong, names of characters were wrong- again, to the point of distraction and beyond.While the story (ies) were interesting enough, these mistakes made me feel as though someone had passed the task of digitizing the book onto their child in junior high school for extra money or something, and I found myself focusing more on that. Maybe the paper version is the same and the fault lies there, but I find that very hard to believe."
1,Poorly written,"Disjointed, bad ending. I kept reading hoping it would get better it did not. Very disappointing. Don't waste your time."
5,Colin Falconer is great,"I am an avid reader - and all of Colin Falconer's books are great. I particularly enjoyed ""Fury"" and ""Dangerous"". They have real history with fictional characters, and all his books are different enough that you can read one after the other."
5,Made well!,"Looks cool, made well, I would not recomend you connect it to your drumset as you can hear it when you hit other drums, keep it seperate and it would be fine."
2,"A little bit more than who's who, but definitely not how they achieved greatness","Simple arithmetic and you know it's stupid to expect much from a 227 content book that attempts to tell the success stories and forumlas of 55 business leaders. Definitely everyone of them deserves its own biography instead of an average 4.13 pages. So I had lowered my standard before I read it. Still I had been quite disappointed. All passages were columns published previously on IBD written by different reporters that not only the writing style but the focus on individual leaders fluctuated much between hard data/history and success formula, primarly on the former. I am sorry that I could gain little knowledge/insight (that I really wanted to learn ""how"" they succeeded) during the reading. I felt even worse after reading from the previous reviewer that the content had been available on the net. In short, please give this book a pass!"
4,Great stories,"ESPECIALLY FOUND THE SECTION ON OPRAH WINFREY INTERESTING. AN SMOOTH, EASY, INTERESTING READ. LEARN SOME OF THE GREAT SECRETS OF THE PROS. WE ENJOYED IT."
3,A nice tale about Pike's career,"It was nice to have story about the predecessor of Kirk, and it was somewhat good. However, I think that Jerry Oltion could've done a lot better with it."
1,Buyer Beware,"I was very mislead by this description in the other review:""This particular collection includes the first of the Kane stories:Skulls in the Stars,The Right Hand of Doom,Red Shadows,Rattle of Bones,The Castle of the Devil,The Moon of Skulls,The One Black Stain,andThe Blades of the Brotherhood.""As it turns out, this ""collection"" only includes one story - The Skulls in the Stars.For your money, you could do better than $2 for one single story. I'll be more careful from here on."
2,Not Worth The $$,"The scent wears off within half-hour; not worth it. Also, the diffuser is upright only in vertical outlets; so if you have horizontal outlet next to each other like this: [o o], you have to use an electrical thingy so the outlet is in the vertical position, but that makes it look a bit cumbersome. Going to look into buying the Fan Fuser that a friend recommends."
1,I only gave it 1 star because Amazon won't let me rate lower,"For years I thought Highlander 2 was the worst movie ever, but not anymore. This now rates as the worst movie I have ever seen. Watching the plot unfold was almost painful, as it seemed to make stops at as many stereotypes as they could cram in there. Maybe they didn't want to take the time to write real characters so they relied on exagerrations. You have the ""Hey baby"" guy at the club (who tries to get the girl into bed by leaving her alone on the dance floor at her showing the slightest hint of interest) you have the dirty old man at the golf course, you have the sleazy biker, the Something-About-Mary-ish gross out jokes (most of which are unfortunately not even remotely funny) I could go on and on. I'm not sure if the characters were supposed to be ditzy and shallow or if that was just a result of bad writing, either way I couldn't care less what happened to them, I just couldn't wait for the movie to finally end."
1,the Stupidest thing is more like it!,All I can say is Why was this piece of crap even made??? I'm soooo glad I didn't pay for this thing and saw it on cable but Geez! This is humor?? for whom I ask. Sure as hell not for me.
1,A bad one,"I always love Western movies, but this one is an exceptional case.For the girls, they are ok! Doing just fit their roles. However, the story .... a big problem. It makes me feel the Director rushed to end the story.Especially the dancing scene in the Chinese resturant. It's really awful when they sang sth "" ...""Not funny i think..."
1,Sluts go on a road trip!,"This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen for all the reasons that other reviewers have mentioned -- toilet humor, raunchy innuendos, and women who act like juvenile ditzbrains. Perhaps the most unnerving thing about it is the attitudes presented by the female characters, that bumping nasties with strangers you meet in bars is something to keep you occupied until you finally find ""the one."" What a terrible message for young women. What a terrible message for men. That the film ended with a ""true love"" situation was perhaps the most unrealistic aspect of the film. In the real world, the hunky male character would have boinked Christina (Diaz) and called it a day. But he sure wouldn't have married a woman who acted like a stoned 15-year-old!"
1,"Embarrasing Piece Of Junk, Don't Waste Your Time Or Money",I was embarrassed for the actress's involved that is how bad it was. The movie is nothing but a series of crude jokes. All it does is make all three women appear trashy! I think they were trying to make an all female version of Something About Mary. They failed.By the way I liked Something About Mary. Men may enjoy this far more than women.
1,Bad (as in bad bad not good bad) movie,"This is a not a good movie. Although there were some funny scenes such as the Ladies' room scene, the movie attempts to be funny by copying scenes from ""There is Something About Mary. It is very awkward.I like Cameron Diaz. She has evolved to an entertaining actress since I first saw her in the movie, ""The Mask"". I am sure she has a lot of script offers. It mystifies me why she accepted the script for this movie."
5,HILARIOUS,"For anyone who is not afraid of looking sex right in the face, this comedy is roll-around-on-the-floor, 'I hope I don't pee my pants,' hilarious. It puts comedy into utterly embarrassing & inconvenient moments of life & dating...and does a great job. This is definetely a good movie for girl's night in...just be careful not to chock on the popcorn while laughing!"
2,A Sour Attempt,"Although this film provided the occasional chuckle (which can be counted on less than one hand), ultimately it proved to be a huge disappointment that insults the audience's intelligence. Diaz plays the commitment-shy party gal who knows she can get all the guys, and ineptly throws herself in romantic pursuit of a man she just met because he might be ""the one.""Furthermore, I fail to understand the appeal of Ms. Diaz and her ... costars,(Christina Applegate and Selma Blair), why they would agree to such ... sight gags is a mystery. I am a fan of Parker Posey, and figure she must have been temporarily insane to agree to this. A wannabe Farrelly brothers film, which is ultimately a cheerless exercise lacking any wit or humour. Did the word plot become obsolete in these people's vocabulary??"
5,LOVED IT!!!!,"I watched this with one of my best friends, my partying buddy. We could relate to so many scenes. Yes, the musical numbers were over the top but, I have not laughed so hard in quite awhile! I showed it to my husband and even he had a good laugh from it!"
4,A Really Great Time,"If you noticed, most of the negative reviews of this movie were written by men. I have to tell you, my friends and I really enjoyed it. We laughed all the way through.I refuse to say that this was a ""chick-flick,"" but there were many jokes that only someone who has tried to walk on grass with spiked heels would understand.It definitely had a few scenes that were...hmmm...eyebrow raising. But I go to the movies to have fun and that is what we got."
4,Surprisingly Funny,"What a happy man I was to have watched this film! I thoroughly enjoyed this film from beginning to end. The story line is typical chick flick but it's boistered by the comedic talents of all three women who are in this film: Cameron Diaz, Christina Applegate and Selma Blair. Casting these three lovely ladies in this film was a smart move. The handsome Jason Bateman's rising star is in here too!Like most people, I am really picky when it comes to comedies. I will see almost any sci-fi flick but when it comes to comedies, I'm about as picky as you get.I personally think Christina Applegate stole this film from Cameron Diaz. Why Christina Applegate is not in more movies, I will never know, she is down right h-i-l-a-r-i-o-u-s. The road trip and bathroom scenes are worth at least a passing viewing alone. Not to mention the church scene and the last scene of the movie.I love it when a movie can make me laugh this hard! Watch and enjoy!"
1,Some giggles but mostly gags...,"I rented this movie when it first came out in 2002. I didn't like it. I just thought it was gross and quite frankly, a bit boring. My two best friends however think its the funniest movie, so they convinced me to watch it again because they thought I'd enjoy it now that I'm older. I did laugh a few times, but again, I just didn't care for it. Christina Applegate is really the only one who made me laugh. She's great. I'm not a Cameron Diaz fan at all. She just annoys me. And its not that I'm a prude either. I like American Pie and The Girl Next Door, ect., but I just can't get into this one. I think you either love it or hate it, and I hated it."
5,THE ULTIMATE CHICK FLICK!!!,"This is a fun movie of girls that have turned the tables on men and enjoy the upper hand for a bit but then Christina (Diaz) realizes she's ready for more than just fun in her life! Great laughs, good story line, and a very fun movie to watch! One of my all time favorites now!"
3,A Must See RENTAL!,"This film could have been so much better and it tries way too hard to gross out the audience just to get some laughs. The only saving grace of the film is the always charming Cameron Diaz and the surprisingly hilarious Christina Applegate. There are a few laugh out loud moments such as the Dry Cleaners scene with a stained dress and Selma Blair(who is less annoying than usual in this film) and the movie montage sequence involving a fashion show as the girls dress up like characters from Pretty Woman and Grease. Other than that, most of the jokes I rolled my eyes in the stupidity of them. If you want a film that you can just go and have a good time, then this is the film for you, but if you're expecting a great comedy, then forget about it. The plot is predictable and besides Christina and Camreron there is no chemistry between the actors, even between Cameron and the man she falls in love with. This movie is definetly a rental, save your $10."
1,Save your money!!,"A one star rating is too good for this movie. It's awful!! It tries too hard to be another ""Something About Mary"", a movie I loved. The comparisons to ""Bridget Jones' Diary"" are an insult to that movie, which I also loved. The endless song and dance routines try to be campy but are really just annoying. One redeeming note was watching Christina Applegate who was probably the only good thing in the movie. It's too bad - cute idea for a movie gone really, really wrong."
1,"Awful, awful, awful","I was looking forward to a fun piece of film, having enjoyed past works of Ms. Diaz. Was I ever disappointed! I could not believe that this film was penned by a female writer. And that she thought her screenplay was an accurate portrayal of women. I don't know *any* women as immature and foolish as these three. And if guys buy this load of hooey are they ever gonna be surprised.Bottom line: don't waste your money."
2,Something About Mary 2,"More .. Cameron Diaz dancing around in her underwear, and more old people talking about sex. This movie should have been titled ""Something About Mary 2"". A few of the jokes were funny, but most just made you groan. If you like gross-out slapstick like Something About Mary this is for you. If you like long set ups with punch lines that make you groan like Meet the Parents, this one's for you too."
2,Nasty Movie,"Nasty is the best way to describe this movie. I'm no prude by any stretch, but I was shocked at how raunchy and stupid this film was. Except for the dream sequence, the movie was like a decent romantic comedy when Thomas Jane (Mr. Right) was on the screen, which wasn't often enough. I first saw him as Mickey Mantle in the film 61*, and he is gorgeous and a great actor.Too bad this film had to go so far in the gutter."
1,Just plain awful,"I guess by now I though most people would be tired of the same old stupid plot encapsulated in a stupid comedy. This movie is a perfect example of how Hollywood can simply put out a piece of junk, tell the public it's good, and the public will buy into it. I haven't been this dissapointed in a movie in quite a while. No imagination, no real plot, just a bunch of low grade light porn moments. Having Cameron Diaz parade around in her bra and underwear just for the sake of all the guys with a crush on her is, unfortunately, enough to sell a movie. If you like stupid, unwhitty, grotesque humor, this one is for you, otherwise, keep looking."
2,The Grossest Thing,"This movie was a dreadful collection of vulgar sex jokes and scenes. I was very disappointed, since normally I am a Cameron Diaz fan."
1,Waste of my time.,I dont understand how anyone could have possibly enjoyed this movie. It was boring. The plot was [bad]. It was tasteless. It was stupid...IT WAS A WASTE OF MY TIME AND MONEY! ...
1,WORSE MOVIE EVER (EVEN FOR A CHICKFLICK MOVIE),"I wanted to see this movie because Cameron Diaz was in it, but it turned out to be a complete waste of time. There was not even one good laugh in the entire movie. Diaz and Applegate seemed very shallow and the story had no appeal or common sense at all.If you want to see comedy, then watch ""There's something about Mary"", ""Not another teen movie"", or one of the Jim Carrey's movies."
1,Perhaps the worst movie of our time,"Awful, horrible, disgusting. This is simply one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It is stupid and I can't believe these good actresses ever let this movie come out.Don't walk, run away from this thing."
4,"Should be called "" the funnest thing""","Very funny movie, great movie to play on a get together night with friends, DVD was in good shape at a good price"
2,Funny....for women,"I saw this film on tv one day and I thought it was decent. Both Diaz and Applegate are beautiful and talented but I dont really watch chick flicks alot. It has some funny moments but from a guys view, its not that great."
4,Excellent Hip Shaking Dance Music,Does anybody recognize any of the songs that were played during the dance club scenes?
1,Astounding,That three such talented actresses would agree to star in this piece of dreck. Astounding.
1,THE WORST MOVIE EVER!!!,"This is the WORST... movie Hollywood has ever produced. This is worse than ""Battlefield Earth"" and ""Swept Away"".You will be embarresed for the actors/actresses. Unclever dialogue, unfunny vulgarity, projectile vomitting. ""The Penis Song"" scene is ABSOLUTELY UNWATCHABLE. The charecters are completely unlikable. You will spend most of your time pressing FFWD on the remote to end it as QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. Don't waste your time. Believe me, This DVD isn't even worth using as a drink coaster. A PIECE OF GARBAGE 100%."
1,The Crudest Thing,"How did they every come up with a title like ""The Sweetest Thing""? Another reveiw said PRUDES BEWARE! I am not a prude but I do not appreicate sick and perverted humor. I thought 40 Days and 40 Nights was bad. That was mild compared to this piece of [material] they had the nerve to call a movie. If this is all that Hollywood can churn out we, the viewing public are in big trouble! Churn is correct. That is what my stomach was doing through most of this so called movie. My husband and I sat at home and watched it this weekend. We kept looking at each other wondering when the comedy and romance was going to emerge in this swill. I ended up fast forwarding through the parts I could not bear to watch any more. At least I was not trapped in a movie theater where I could not fast forward and escape the huge chunks of this mess of a movie. Viewers beware! PU!"
1,The pits.,"This movie is awful. I don't say this because I object to the raunchy humor -- I don't. But this is a perfect example of today's Hollywood, in which they cast actors who have little or no innate sense of comic timing. Sure, these women say their lines and do (supposedly) funny things, but they are not comediennes -- and it shows...painfully! That problem, combined with the slapdash, thrown-together storyline, makes for one terrible film.Selma Blair, the most talented of the three leads, unfortunately will never live down the film's oral sex scene. It's too bad, because she's a pretty good character actress. But from now on, this humiliating scene will be an indelible stain on her resume.This film insults the audience's intelligence. We all can do better."
1,Not much sweet about this one,"It appears to me like they were trying to take advantage of the Sex in the City type of situational hype, but this one is a disaster from the start. The comic gags (falling during the wedding ceremony, getting blasted in the bathroom, etc.) just aren't very funny and I'll laugh at almost anything. When this was in the theatres I think 10 people saw it and if Cameron Diaz wasn't in it the number would have dropped to 3. No problem with the actresses, just give them something better to work with. If I want to watch Sex in the City I'll turn on the tv. Also, the unrated warnings all over this are odd since I didn't see anything in this one that would be unrated material. It looks like Cameron Diaz is using the same movie selection advisor as Gwenyth Paltrow. It's hard to believe that this looked good as a screenplay. Why would she choose to make a movie this bad?"
4,"If you liked ""There's Something About Mary...""","If you liked ""There's Something About Mary,"" then you will appreciate this movie. It was very unexpected, though I did laugh at some parts. Other parts, where they're singing in the restaurant, I did not understand where that came from. Let's just say it was a very interesting, yet predictable movie."
5,The female version of 'American Pie',"This movie is a combination of 'Bridget Jones Diary' and 'American Pie'. It's partly a romantic comedy, but there's some sight gags and semi-crass humor involved as well. I found it to be very funny, but if you don't like this kind of humor then you probably won't enjoy this movie. Cameron Diaz and Christina Applegate are perfect onscreen together, totally believable as best friends."
5,hilarious,"I love this movie. The comedic performances were outstanding; cameron diaz is always great, and I think jason bateman tends to be underappreciated in a lot of his roles. look at arrested development. he's brilliant."
2,AKA -' The Raunchiest Thing' - Not for Everyone,"This movie is not for everyone. Although the actresses do well enough with the material, the material itself isn't so great in the first place. So, break it down:If you like three grown women acting as crass and raunchy as post adolescent boys in a frat house, then go see this movie.If you mistake disgusting musical numbers for humor, then go see this movie.(...)While some may feel this film contains vulgar humor, I found it contained no humor at all, and was just vulgar, period."
1,A disgrace to film,"I found this movie not only to be unbelievably degrading to women and men, but incredibly offensive. I'm sorry, but nobody wants to hear a man, let alone a woman talk about their genitalia and sex escapades constantly, as the characters do in this film. The plot is tired and repetitive, the script undeniably forced, and the jokes limited to fart and sex. The writers go to far in this film, and end up going backwards. The director and writer go all out in attempts to portray women in a different light, but succeed only in creating three, let's face it, unchaste (and that's in polite terms) morally corrupt women who try to act as men, but end up looking like desperate porn stars. One star, and I'm being generous."
4,"A ""Chick Flick"" that a Guy can like!!!","Simply, this movie is worth buying. F-yeah!Miss Applegate, I STILL love you. ;^)"
4,Cameron Diaz is hillarious in this gross-out comedy.,"Don't go renting this movie expecting a nice, squeaky-clean romantic comedy. It's Not. It's a gross-out, wildly hillarious, fart joke of a good time. Christina Applegate is absolutely hillarious as Diaz's friend. Diaz also proves that she can hold a starring role. Selma Blair really isn't in the movie a whole lot, but her scenes are pretty funny. This movie is not for the faint at heart. Jokes include a song devoted to the penis, a glory hole, a pierceing in a bad spot, rotten chinese food, and a man's bathroom. Be sure to check this one out if your a fan of ""American Pie"" of ""There's Something About Mary!"""
2,No audience connection,"I have no doubt that there is a story here, but the flow of this movie doesn't really want to let the story come out. The basic premise is two people find each other when they least expect it. In this comedy, the story is driven by one character's quest to find this love before it is too late. Hijinks ensue.What can go wrong with this? Comedy is largely driven by the seemingly unconnected episodes of our lives, but in this movie, the unconnected episodes just seem to distract. How does a song-and-dance number fit in? An unfortunate incident with the braces also seems out of place as it doesn't seem to drive the story at all. Selma Blair is a good actress, but her role in this film doesn't seem to mesh with the others.There are some funny moments, but they are few and far between. I would not recommend seeing this movie. The story doesn't connect with the audience at all."
2,It is so bad it is just bad.,"This movie tries so hard to be outrageous and funny, it is just bad. I usually enjoy raunchy humor (ex.There's Something about Mary, American Pie) but this was just stupid. Occasionally it might make you smile a little and leads you to believe it may get better, but it never does. It just doesn't work and they try to throw in so many wild scenes that it just pulls you out of the movie. The only reason I didn't give it one star is because I did somewhat enjoy a couple of scenes and it had somewhat of a plot-although it did veer from it quite often. I would definately recommend not spending any money on this movie. If you want to see it borrow it from someone or check your cable stations."
3,A raw comedy about girls in the city (but not New York),"Think Sex and the City turbo boosted with scatalogical humor and raw comedy and you have the template for The Sweetest Thing. A party girl in San Francisco named Christina falls for charming Peter one night at a club. They connect and that should have been it. Enter Christina's 2 rommates who help her find Peter again at his wedding to someone else! What follows along the way are alot of ""Something About Mary"" style jokes and irony in a romantic comedy that pushes the envelope."
1,It just doesn't get worse than this.,"It really is a pity that there is no 0 star option. This movie is one of the most ill-conceived ventures to have graced (or disgraced) the screen. It's like one of those bad comedy routines where the comedian just won't get off the stage, but worse, because you can't throw eggs at your television. It's not just the script. It's not just the timing. It's not just the acting. It is an entirety that is worse than the sum of its parts, and, while I realize that I have presented little analysis in my criticism, I simply had to write a review. I could not stand by and let humanity suffer any more than necessary at the hands of one of the most worthless pieces of cinema ever known. I will grant it this, however. I am a reformed person after seeing it, because I am now convinced that I have glimpsed my own personal Hell, and it would be watching this movie over and over."
1,It Doesn't Deserve One Star!!!,"First of all let me state, that I do enjoy low brow humor in various movies. I loved the original Scary Movie. But this movie rarely made me laugh. My wife rented it and as the movie dragged on for what seemed like days, she looked at me sheepishly and admitted, ""This movie really sucks!""The acting was forced and terrible. I can say with some confidence that this did not further the career of anyone associated with this film. Whoever wrote the script, hopefully used a fake name. The laughs came so rarely, I forgot it was a comedy. And as a movie that tried to have a heart warming ending, it committed the greatest sin. ""Sweetest"" did not make me care about any character in the film.Save your money, don't rent, don't buy, don't even waste your time. Turn off the television and stare at the blank screen; it would be more entertaining than this movie."
1,A total waste.,"First off, do not get me wrong - I am no prude. I love well timed quickly edited comedies and a few good potty or bodily secretion jokes are often lots of fun. This movie however went way off course. I love the cast and concept , but the direction, timing and editing are so flat that none of the jokes really works. You can almost here the director say ""now mug shamelessly for the camera and look cute"" and the camera stays in place- for a long time. The girls almost look like they are waiting for the film to stop rolling. Really - a sad spectacle."
2,The Sweeeeeeeeetest Thing,"Ok the first time i saw this movie i laughed a couple times but thought it was horrible, i then heard my best friend that goes to school in another state watched it like everyday so i gave it another shot and its actually quite funny, i musta been in a...mood when i watched it the first time, chick flick or not by category, this movie is a laugh."
4,too goofy,"The sweetest thing is a cool movie. It can be funny, but it also can be dorky. I moved out of state from my bff when I was 17. We grew up together. Now we are in our late 20's and we still keep in touch. We've only seen each other once after my move. Watching the Sweetest Thing makes me wish I never moved out of state and our friendship was just as close and goofy as this movie. I'm jealous for all of those close friends out there. I've never made a close friend like her."
4,Finally a girl movie that is honest!!,"This was the best girl based movie I've ever seen. Its honest and real. That might be why it is offensive to some. Its hilarious. I recommend a bucket of popcorn and your closest friends while watching this movie. My husband even thought it was great. He was shocked at times, but laughed anyways."
3,The Sweetest Thing,"This movie is strictly for fun.... not made to be serious or even believable. But if you watch it for this reason alone - fun - it is a good time. Parts of the movie can be embarrassing for some people, so think before you go.All in all, my fiance and I enjoyed it very much and laughed a great deal."
1,"THE WORST SUPPOSEDLY ""GIRLIE"" MOVIE OF ALL TIME","Three things I learned after watching this movie:1)Cameron Diaz can't act and shouldn't be allowed anywhere near a multiplex2)Christina Applegate needs better material, because she, actually, is a decent actress3)do NOT rent a ""girlie"" movie with a label that says ""raunchier version with NEW footage Too Hot for Cinemas"" - this means this ""girlie"" movie is really for guys and/or women who enjoy watching anorexically skinny women singing, dancing, and driving a car in their underpantsTherefore, this is NOT a ""girlie"" movie - so ladies, keep looking"
5,My favorite movie of all time!!,Hello. My name is Jaime. I am 18 yrs. old I think the sweetest thing is one of the best movies I have seen. It widely explains the day of and average girl. Its hard to find the right man so when a women thinks she might have him she will go to any extend to get him. This movie makes mejust wanna get up and dance. i love all the music in it i am hoping to find the soundtrack somewhere. I hope a lot of people enjoyed the movie as much as i did.
2,Funny but no story,"The actors did a very good job in turning this meaningless movie to a funny one. You will remember the jokes but I bet in 15 mins into the movie you'll feel sorry for yourself. Nevertheless, the dirty jokes are funny."
1,Not as Advertised,"I have had good luck in the past with Amazon, but this order was not as advertised. There are 3 versions of this DVD out there and the one I was sent was not as described or pictured. I was looking for the longer version that has the resturant segment in it where all three girls sing, dance and others people join in.Live & learn I guess."
4,Not perfect but still funny,"The Sweetest Thing follows a few weeks in the lifes of twenty-something friends Christina, Courtney and Jane as Christina tries to track down her perfect man Peter with Courtney accompaning her and Jane's messing around with her stupid but cute re-bound guy. There's a lot of dirty humor which isn't usually found in a ""chick flick"" and a lot of unbelievable situations, but it's still a fun movie with plenty of laughs...Makes me want to grab my friends for a road trip kind of movie."
4,Disgustingly Funny,A Great Comedy That Not Only Made Me Laufgh But Made Me Want To Keep Watching. It's The Story Of This Girl That Meets The Guy She Thinks Is The Love Of Her Life. Except She Only Met Him For Like Ten Min. Good Movie With Some Great Fun For Comedy. Good Adult Humor.
3,"ROAD TRIP for feminists, but guys will enjoy it too","After all the guy oriented gross out comedys in recent memory (AMERICAN PIE, ROAD TRIP, VAN WILDER et al) comes one written by SOUTH PARK's Nancy Pimental in which it's the girls turn to take the comic low road. Starring Cameron Diaz, Christina Applegate and Selma Blair as three none too bright girls who decide to take revenge on guys who have treated them like dirt they (predictably) set out on a cross country road trip to catch the creep responsible. There are amusing bits along the way featuring an amorous biker and a memorably funny rest-room eye gouging that has to be seen to be believed. The three leads are good, but the movie veers uncomfortably between whimsy and gross outs at times. It's still recommended, if only for the scene where some guys are spying on Applegate getting her breasts groped in the womens bathroom."
1,A disappointment,"I love Cameron Diaz, but I think this is the worst film she has done. Very bad writing, and unfunny jokes."
2,This is 1 of the worst movies around!,This movie was soooooo boring i was miss led by the title thinking i was going to get a good movie about three single girls but instead i got a got a movie that was terrible. Its all about cameron diaz walking around in her underwear or if not that in some skimpy little out fit making everyone want her. Every scene has something discusting.
2,This movie is stupid,"The Sweetest Thing was a waste of time and money. If anyone gave me this script to look at, I would say something like, ""This is a joke, right?"" Cameron Diaz is a very good actress, so I don't understand why she would waste her talent on mess like this. Don't buy, rent, or borrow this movie from anyone."
3,Previews Are Misleading,"To see the previews for this film, you'd think romantic comedy, fun for the family right? Not so, definately NOT a film for anyone under 16. Although there is somewhat of a romantic story line in the plot, the film revolves almost entirely around sex sex sex! The girls in this movie are [very amourous] and live the american stud's dream life!Although it is a funny movie if you get the sexual inuendo's and can tolorate an off color sense of comedy, to those who embarras easily, stay away or you will be as red as a lobster!"
2,Its just 'ok',"If your buying it because it is organic, ok....but dont expect any miricles for scalp itch...for what it is SUPPOSED to be treat. Helped me 0 with that...I ended up getting relief from Demorex extra strength. Good luck. I have MAJOR scalp itch problems."
1,Absolutlely Worthless!!!,"Unreal, I read the other reviews and thought this would be good for me. The editoial review said ""New York Times ""Don't leave home without STREETWISE"" OK, has to be good right? Honestly, this is just unbelievable, a map with about 10 cultural sites, 6 or 7 hotels and the metro map inset (you can get a printable metro map online at stm.info). Sheesh, what a waste of money."
2,Not for street riding,"These might make a great addition to a costume or maybe work great for off-road riding, but I warn any fellow riders looking for street-riding goggles to look elsewhere. These essentially eliminate your peripheral vision to a point where riding in any traffic would be extremely dangerous. Save your money and your life, look elsewhere."
5,Love them,These are so comfortable I never minded wearing them for long periods of time. They pretty much lived on my head for a week. Very breathable. Never fogged. Good vision in the periphery. Helped me get through multiple dust storms. I would buy another pair if I lost them.
3,Too small for my big head.,I have a pretty large head. These look like kids goggles on me. There is no way for my eyeglasses to fit inside either. They seem to be built pretty well.
5,Great value,"I wear glasses, and these goggles fit right over them, and fixed the problem of the wind causing my eyes to water."
3,Dirtbike Goggles,Item came as advertised. good quality. Fit over glasses. Used with contact lenses. The anti-fog vents allowed dust to enter - not too comfortable with dirt in my eyes/contact lenses.
1,Junk,"No way these could be over-glasses goggles. Poor construction, terrible fit. My dog's Doggles are a thousand percent better product."
5,WONDERFUL!,"I needed over glasses goggles for Burning Man - and these did the job! They helped me through the dust storms and it was super easy to switch out the lenses on the fly in the middle of a white out at night! They were super comfy, especially over layers of Playa-fied hair and scarves. I will buy another pair in a heart beat if I ever lose or break mine!!"
3,Too Big for Small Face,"I'm a smaller female and these googles were much too wide for my face. Air came in the sides and they pushed down on the tip of my nose, so I returned them."
4,Surprisingly Good!,"Wow, for a BBC mini series made in 1981, I have to say this was pretty good! Sure, the special effects were extremely hokey and pathetic, but hey, when you have characters named Ford Prefect, Zaphod Beeblebrox, Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz, and Slartibartfast, the cheesier the FX, the better! The translation from the book(s) to the screen was very well done, keeping with Douglas Adams' orginial intent. Much of what was shown in the film was very close to the book, and the acting was convincing. Even though it is about 3 hours long, it captures only about 2 and a half of the 6 books. We find out what the question to the ultimate answer is, and we're left to imagine the rest. There were many things I wish they would have shown in the series, but time is quite constraining. For what they had to work with, they did a decent job. I highly recommmend this if you can get your hands on it."
1,wrong item,ordered 1980 video with simon jones. received different video. my fault for never returning wrong item.
5,Love This Pedal !!,The DW made Double kick pedal is one of the most responsive pedals I have bought yet..the cost on this pedal is dirt cheap for the performance you will get from it. it has an adjustablecam and also separate adjustments for each pedal for how much tention you prefer on eachpedal.. This is the best pedal on the market for the price by far.
4,Good Pedal...Good Price,I bought this pedal for my practice kit and it works very well. It's a perfect pedal for developing your double bass chops and I would recommend it to any drummer.
4,Overall looks great,"Well this is the first socked set I have owned so I dont really have anything to compare it to. I couldn't order this directly from amazon as they do not ship tools to FPO/APO address. So I ordered it from the Auto Alley, they shipped it the next day and it got here long before the estimated arrival date. This is small and compact and light. The sockets seem pretty durable but I haven't used them yet. If it turns out to be durable I would buy this again for a friend. The only reason I gave it a 4/5 is because i havent use it yet."
5,MUSICIANS AND SONGWRITERS WHO LOVE BRAZILIAN MUSIC,THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF WORK. IT DEMONSTRATES BEYOND THE SHADOW OF A DOUBT THE GENIUS OF CARLOS ANTONIO JOBIM. WHO EVER LOVES BRAZILIAN MUSIC! THIS CD IS A MUST HAVE!
5,Good,"This is a great cd and will be in your cd player for months. Flawless to the untrained eye but to a tribe head it might have some holes. If your like me and ahve heard every tribe song then you start to think, well why'd they put ""we got the jazz"" on instead of ""Lyrics to go"". Also Q-tip's hit at the end kinda doesn't fit in to well and if they wanted new stuff they should have put on the great song from ""the Love moment"", either ""Like it like that"" or ""common ground"". and it was shocking ""Excursions"" wasn't on there. Still i enjoy the cd very much and shouldn't be ignored at all, but if your willing to spend a little more i would get the 5 tribe cd's and and get ALL the good stuff, because there is many more great songs then the tracks on this cd."
5,great collection,"I love this collection, but I think i got an edited version. in jazz (we've got), does anyone else have some parts edited out?"
4,Good Compilation But Missing Other Wanted Stuff,"Why Isn't Mr. Incognito included. Excursions, Words Spillin off my tongue, and even Push it along??? Im a big ATCQ fan but im disappointed... Nothing in it would make me pick this up.. This is a great album for people who never bought any or all ATCQ albums... WHERE CAN WE PICK UP MR. INCOGNITO? Im glad i got this as a promo"
4,Great for the young ones.,"A Tribe Called Quest's Anthology is a GREAT overall veiw of the collection of music distributed through the years. I only rated this CD with 4 stars because it doesnt completely posses the fullness of an anthology. I am 16 and I purchased the CD after reading about the ATCQ classics mainly, The Infamous Date Rape and Steve Biko (Stir It Up) which unfortunatley are not here. But all in all everything else is on point. Electric Relaxation, Award Tour, and the clever Bonita Applebum make up for the shortcomings and extras like, I left My Wallet in El Segundo, Senerio and Find Away top off the Anthology. So overall this CD is worth the money."
4,Tribe Called Quest - Anthology,"First up I give this album a 4.5/5 for the fac that it has REAL hiphop beats and good lyrics. Real hiphop, they stayed true to the sound. I just didnt give it a 5 since im not the biggest TCQ fan and of that style. But all these emcees spit hott lyrics in this album. Tracks like ""Keep It Movin"", ""Hot Sex"" have ill beats. This album does have a real jazzy sound to it, which im not the biggest fan of, but its more of a unique style, and they deserve props for trying new styles. So overall this is a really good album, and worth getting.My Top 5 Songs1.Buggin Out2.Hot Sex3.Oh My God4.Luck Of Lucien5.Keep It Movin"
5,One of the Best Hip Hop groups in History,"Man, I loved this group!!!! They are ono of the best hip-hop groups ever!!!!!! I remember those songs like ""Award Tour"", ""The Jazz"", and my personal favorite ""Electric Relaxation"". I don't know why these brothers broke up, they were too talented! I like this greatest hits CD, because they got all of their best. In my opinion Midnight Mauraders was not only one of the best hip-hop albums ever made, but one of the greatest albums ever made in any genre. That whole CD was just full of good fun vibes and energy. A work of art indeed. This Anthology is even just as good. Phife Dog and Q-Tip were a true dynamic duo. You will never see a combination like that anymore. I recommend this CD to all music lovers."
5,Classic,I've been recently getting back into old school hip hop. This CD is a classic and a must have. So glad I bought it!
4,Check out the Japanese Import!,"It's sad to really see ATCQ putting out an ""Anthology"" album. However, this US release is really good. Tracks like ""Steve Biko (Midnight Muraders)"" should've made the collection, but they finally re-issued ""If the Papes Come (it's a really rare find!)"" which is pretty satisfying. On the japanese import CD that I bought has all of these tracks comes with one additional track which is the phattest ATCQ composition EVER MADE...""Mr. Incognito"". If you are an old school ATCQ head, you should know the track."
4,"Why on earth is ""Vivrant Thing"" on here?","Really, if you want a crash course in ATCQ, then pick this up. But if you already have all of their albums, then there's really no point, unless you wanna check out ""If the Papes Come"" (which is kinda hard to find anywhere). There are some really good songs on here from all of the albums with the exception of the weak ""Find a Way"" from The Love Movement. Although many fans will complain about their favorite songs not being on here (like ""Ham n' Eggs"" or ""Show Business"" featuring Sadat X, Lord Jamar, and Diamond D), this collection is pretty good. But why did they tack on the too-too-recent Q-Tip solo, ""Vivrant Thing""? (Both that song and this compilation were made in 1999.) If anything, that song shows how commercial the Tribe members have gotten up until that point."
3,2nd CD=Fluff,"For a Quest fan looking for a true anthology, get a better Greatest Hits album. The second CD of ""Anthology"" was not worth the extra few dollars..."
4,Go tribe!,"While I am a Tribe fan, there are some things wrong with this CD. Where's 1nce Again? And there are three filler songs on here(tracks 13,14and 15),but otherwise a great album by a great group."
3,Weird cut,"I'll have to dissent from the chorus of adulation: this t-shirt has strange proportions. I wear small; my Gap t-shirts and both my merino base layers are small and fit well. This one though is fine around the body core but the sleeves are a bit short and worse, it's very tight around the neck. Sadly it has to go back.Another thing to note is that it's pretty thick, feels a bit like a sweater. I put it on the scale - 0.57lb; for comparison my Redram/Icebreaker long sleeve weighs 0.44lb, and it's not the thinnest wool t-shirt either."
5,Very good,"Warm and comfortable. Product performed well. No itch. Was used for backwoods camping in Canada, in late October. Price is good value for merino wool."
2,not as warm or comfortable as expected,"I live in michigan and wanted a great everyday base layer. I am 6'1"" and 160 lbs. I run and bike and usually wear medium clothing. I purchased the medium (Regular - not tall - it was $30 more!) and the sleeve lenght was a bit short but OK since I was wearing it underneath. I liked how soft if felt, but it was a bit tight at the neck and the colar seems be just a bit uncomfortable around my neck.The only other good base layer I own is from louis Garneu - and it is 1/2 the thickness of the minus 33 and it is warmer. I was disapointed with the warmth of this base layer, I read good reviews, but I found it was not warmer than a good fitted cotton shirt.THe packaging and box it comes in are very nice."
5,Good Base Layer,"This product exceeded my expectations. Living in the southwestern United States, the temperature doesn't get as low as the colder climes of the country, but being a midweight layer, it is perfect for the winters here. I'm 6'5"" and about 350 lbs, and the 4XLT is long in the arms, but perfect for the rest of me. The wool is soft, and when combined with a top layer, it cuts the wind out and keeps me warm with a cotton t-shirt down to about 30 F.I highly recommend spending the extra money to get a good quality base layer. The wool is not itchy, it feels soft and comfortable. It's a multiday wear for camping and hiking, and is of good quality sewing.I highly recommend this product."
5,scuba diver woman,"I am a cold water drysuit diver in Northern California. I bought a pair of Minus 33 top and bottom to wear under my drysuit in 45-50 degree water. They are awesome! I do layer with another thermal shirt, but when everyone else says they are cold, I am quite content tempature wise. Thanks for making such a great product, hope you will market more to scuba divers."
5,great shirt,100% wool sure keeps your body temp perfect. Especially when you have 100% silk underneath. Too bad it could not be made in USA.
5,Light and Comfortable,"Warm and not itchy, this shirt is a good first layer on the any run or outdoor activities you are doing."
2,Too itchy,I may be one of the only customers who does not like Minus33 tops. Unfortunately the top was prickly and itchy for me. I tried to like it and feel comfortable but it was just too prickly feeling.I have the bottoms which I like though.
4,Super comfy but not as warm as I hoped,I do really really like the shirt. Very comfortable and looks good on its own. I typically wear this under a sweater so that I don't need a bulky overcoat. Other reviewers imply that it is as warm as a sweater which I found for me was not true even though this is a midweight and I am not generally a cold natured person. I will try a heavyweight wool base shirt next.
4,One of my favorites.,"This is a deeply flawed and highly entertaining Stonewall pastiche. It is told through the eyes of ""Matty Dean,"" a small town boy recently relocated to NYC to discover gay life. He finds that gay life in NYC isn't all he'd cracked it up to be, and is arrested, disappointed at a gay rights demonstration, shocked by the rules and regulation at ""gay friendly"" Fire Island, and ultimately finds himself caught up in an historic turning point. La Miranda is a (here comes the big CLICHE) tour de force performance, and worth the price of rental/admission/purchase. The clicher: The songs of The Shangri-Las are used as a framing device. Love it!"
5,Excellent storyline presents the historical Stonewall riot,"With its excellent fictious storyline, this film tells the truth about who fought back against police harrassment in the very real Stonewall riot in New York City in 1969. This is the event credited as the start of modern day Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgendered political advocacy. It is also the reason most major U.S. cities celebrate Pride at the end of June despite the oftentimes overwhelming heat.The outstanding quality of photography and editing gives this film the power to take you back in time with images that will replay in your thoughts long after the final credits. After 18 years of awarding ""Harold and Maude"" as my favorite film, ""Stonewall"" now has first place. It is the best gay-related film since ""Parting Glances."""
5,Thoughtful & Imaginative Read for Everyone,"A perfectly wonderful read. I picked up The Dog of Knots, found myself transported in time and place, and, when my journey had ended, I felt enlightened and thankful.This book touches upon so many emotions...the love of family and friends, the pain of loss, the anxiety of impending peril, and one remarkable unifying element...the simple and basic compassion for a tired old stray dog. Ms. Kaplan has shown us that humanity is both precious and everlasting, despite all of our religious and political differences.Deep in symbolism, rich in characters, and a story that has you enchanted from page one. The perfect 'family' book."
4,Straigth Niceness,"This CD will grow on anyone. It has the feeling of back in the day when lyrics meant something or could be a form of expression meant to catch jokes. Plus the original style of the wordplay, this CD is a must have."
1,Glucose Syrup (Tapioca) as Main Ingredient is a put-off,"Having had MANY candies for coffee before, I tried these to see if it was a little stronger tasting. It was, but the texture is a bit odd, and the goop in the middle is just disgusting. Glucose Syrup as the main ingredient should have made me stay away. These won't be back on the shelf at my house again. You want better coffee candy without the corn syrup crap, try Kopiko."
5,My favorite,I love expresso coffee and this candy is just like extending my coffee drinking into the afternoon. The mix of dark chocolate and expresso is perfect.
4,The Modern Lone Ranger,"Most of Jackson's stories are very entertaining and captivating. He certainly put his life on the line to protect our citizens from the evils of criminals. My only criticism was his over glamorizing himself in the movie, ""The Good Old Boys"". Also, it appears his bragging of his heavy drinking was not a good example for young men who look up to the Texas Rangers as a role model."
3,The story of one man's career in the Texas Rangers,"A very entertaining story and very interesting at first. This is basically an autobiography and there are a lot of first person observations and opinions. The book starts with his early life and how he happened to join the Texas Rangers. It then shifts to a number of adventures he had tracking down specific people and solving crimes. These stories were the best part of the book. As the story progresses it gets more and more personal and towards the end loses continuity as the author complains about the influence of people with money, politicians, and other unfair facts of life. I am not sorry I bought the book, but I wish the author had stuck to the format and the type of content that made up the first 60% of the story."
5,Awesome!,My husband enjoyed this book! He said it was awesome and very interesting. He loves reading about the Texas Rangers. Amazon has a great selection for readers! I have bought three different books and so far they have been a great buy!
4,The Last of the Texas Rangers,Having met Mr. Jackson in person and being familiar with areas he writes about made this a special reading. Enjoyable reading. An interesting look at how the West is still being won through the eyes of one of the great present-day Texas Rangers
1,One Ranger : A Memoir,"Ordered in June ,never received it.Watch out for pijocky , They won't give me an answer.Have not heard a thing !Ken"
5,Get to know a Texas Ranger!,"If you love Texas History and the Rangers, you will not want this book to end. I felt like I was sitting on the front porch, listening to this man tell me his story personally. I laughed with him, cried with him, and experienced his years of keeping Texans safe.This book may not be a literary work of art but it is very special and gives great insight into the life of a modern day Ranger. Joaquin told his story and held nothing back, for good or bad, and his honesty was refreshing."
4,Things change,"Earlier reviewers have given a good run down on this book. It's about a man, nothing more, nothing less. He just happened to be a Texas Ranger. Not just any Ranger, but I'm sure he would claim to be just another Ranger. Mr.Jackson's reputation preceded him; I'd heard all the stories. He was the baddest of the badasses, the Ranger's Ranger. Reading this book one sees how the man changed. The Zavala election, where all he did was enforce the law; not kowtow to the anglo power structure. He will tell you all he did was enforce the law, but he changed that county and the state. Having now met Mr. Jackson and read this book, I too have changed. Maybe the stories were true, maybe they were not. But this I can say, Mr. Jackson is one hell of a man."
3,Needs more detail,"Although this book provides a foundation for a new table top war game, it does not contain enough information to describe a ""Toy Battle System"". The first in the Giant Monster Rampage series, I expected more details on the system mechanics and options for play.This book was followed by Giant Monster Rampage II, which I have also reviewed."
1,Traci Christian get's on my nerves,If there was any crime that TMC has committed it is impersonating an author. I feel like a sucker for buying a book to hear someone whine about Dr. Laura. This is coattail riding to the fullest. Buy it for your in-laws if you don't want them to come around anymore.
1,Self Rightous Drivel,"I bought this book thinking it would show a different perspective. What it showed was the most mindless self centered drivel I have ever read. I am sorry I spent money to support this ""author"""
1,Poorly written,This writter wants to get something off her chest so she writes a book. It was hard to follow her logic. She just assumes others think like her. Not a good read.
1,Stupid Book,This book is a joke. It's just Traci trying to come off as a moral superior. Don't waste your money
1,Hate book,I don't know why the author wrote a whole book attacking someone elses view. Not a very nice thing to do.
1,Filled with errors,The author tries to use a type of logic but it does not work. I think she just hates Dr. Laura.
1,Making money off someone famous,"This book was full of mindless dribble. It was not interesting, even though Dr. Laura's name is in the title. Her name is hardly mentioned in the book. The author uses Dr. Laura's name to sell the book and then goes on and on about absolutely nothing. If the author had something worthwhile to say she would not have needed to piggyback off Dr. Laura's fame."
1,Dr. Laura's Critics Sponge Off Her Popularity,"This author has nothing worthwhile to add. Basically the author is jealous of Dr. Laura's success and this is a transparent theme throughout the book.best use of book: if you have a table with 1 short leg, use it as a prop.can I get a refund?"
1,Annoying,"Traci M. Christian is a self-promoting, annoying person who thinks she knows everything and represents the only intelligent opinion. I think the title of this book says something about her politeness and tact."
5,Refreshing opinions regarding Dr. Laura's authoritative view,"In my opinion, the author does an excellent job of presenting alternative view points without bashing Dr. Laura personally. The issues the author addresses in her book are important to everyone, but especially women. Unlike Dr. Laura who only allows for two classifications of people (those who are totally good because they accept her opinons and view points without question and those who are totally bad because they question or even disagree with her view points) ""Dr. Laura Gets On My Nerves"", leaves room on the continuum for other opinions, options, and beliefs. It is a book that most everyone will enjoy reading."
3,"Targeting a new audience with computerized,robotic sounds","[...] As for the album,Vocalist Paul Carrack is still in fine form,as is the songwriting of Paul Carrack,Mike Rutherford and collaborator B.A. Robertson,but the album's arrangements are the problem.Clearly attempting to target a new,younger audience,we get a totally computerized,programmed,robotic dance music sound with scarcely a trace of Mike Rutherford's guitar or any actual hand-played instrumentation.Lots of synthesized burps,stutters,noises etc. do a disservice to the songs.No wonder the group's U.S.A. label balked for a year before releasing it here.The group's unreleased in America 1999 album ""Mike & The Mechanics""(A.K.A. ""M6"") was superior.Buy it instead."
5,The bonus DVD played just fine for me...,"It is true that the DVD is in PAL format, but my Toshiba SD3805 DVD player played it just fine, while my 5-year old Toshiba player gave back a ""Not NTSC"" error and refused. I also had success playing it in my computer using PowerDVD - no problems at all.The movies are very ""interesting"" - kind of like modern art for music.Also note that the music on the DVD is just straight 2.0 stereo just like on the CD - they didn't go all out and make a 5.1 remix that would have been AWESOME. Oh well, it's still great."
5,Mike And The Mechanics 2004,"It is great to hear The Mechanics again. This album is an import and did cost more but it is pretty amazing. It has a bit of Techo sound to it. I really enjoyed the last album, ""Beggar on the Beach of Gold"" which was pretty non-existent in the USA. This album is better in MHO and will appeal to young people who have never listened to the Mechanics."
2,The Worst Mechanics album,"What a disappointment. The heart of the Mechanics is the songs and the two great vocalists. Paul Carrack is a good singer but the songs here are weak. Only 8 real songs as one is an instrumental and there is nothing very catchy that stands out. Also very little guitar on this record. It sounds like an experimental recording and not a very good one. A sad way for Carrack to bow out but the new ""Road"" CD brings them back to a more traditional sound."
5,Another Excellent Carrack/Rutherford Project,"I can sum up this CD in a few words. Overall - Excellent. M6 and Rewired definitely among my list of ""must have"" top CD's. Great song writing, singing and production. Very natural energy flow and melodic structures. It grows on you and definitely holds up when revisited. The bonus DVD was also excellent! I can't wait for the next Carrack/Rutherford/Robertson collaboration!Kerry GordonToronto"
5,great,"Got this watch as a gift for my brother, he loves it but it's just a little bit too big for his wrist but all he had to do was get a couple of links taking out."
4,"Good watch, but.....","This watch is nice. It goes with my business casual very well. Only downfall is that I wish this was a screw down crown because sometimes it gets snagged or bumped and the crown pops out stopping the time. Thus requiring resetting the time. It is very infrequent when this happens, otherwise a very nice watch. Keeps time great!!"
2,best looking pos i have ever seen,so..... i get the watch looks like a million bucks. wear it the first night frigging bezel pops out twice through the night. there is nothing worse then having to set your watch twice during your date. full refund
4,Invicta Pro-Diver quartz,"This is a beautiful watch. I was going to purchase the automatic version, but couldn't pass up the price. Overall quality is very nice, and it has that ""solid"" feel of a fine watch. I had looked at a Rolex weeks before buying the Invicta, and I have to say, the resemblance is amazing. The value is really hard to beat. The only glitch has been the loss of a few minutes occasionally- which required me to reset. After doing some reading on Invicta quartz watches, I discovered that very often the batteries are not fully set in thier mounts- thus causing erratic performance. This has not occurred lately, but I plan on having the battery checked/replaced soon. I will very likely purchase another Invicta- probably an automatic. Amazon continues to provide excellent service."
2,terrible with water,"this watch is not made for underwater activity. I already returned the first one i bought from amazon because the ticking was sporadic and then the one i received allowed in moisture and now the face has water drops inside. this is a terrible watch, i would just spend a little more a buy a better quality and avoid the disappointment and frustration with this watch."
1,warranty useless,"Very disappointed! I washed my hands and the""diving watch"" fogging badI called the company and they want $28 check for shipping back to meplus $15 will cost me to send it to them,I bought the watch $53I garranty!If ""INVICTA"" does not change there policy to sent new WATCHand get broken one back at no cost, they will be bankrupt soon.Customers do not care about the BRAND NAME any more they want good product."
1,Not water resistant - False Advertising,"Anyone claiming to have this watch with a screw down crown is lying and just copying from other reviews. This watch arrives with the 8932 number on the attached tag, but on the back of the case it clearly says 8932A. Why? Who knows? This watch was purchased specifically due to its claim that it is water resistant, it clearly states in all advertisements that it has a screw down crown. It does not have a screw down crown.If you look around and read through the reviews you will see again and again, people who actually have the watch realize it does not have a screw down crown.This means if water is splashed near the crown, it can go right into the watch body.Do not purchase this watch if you intend to ever get water near it. It is not a diver watch by any stretch of the imagination."
3,At the moment very pleased with my new watch,"I am just receiving my watch. Beautiful. It has exactly 37mm as advertised, which is more than enough for a kind of watch like this, remember that it's not a Vidalia Onion. The crown doesn't screw at all, so I am a little suspicious about water resistance. Very well packaged and very easy to adjust the band by yourself. I hope to enjoy it. Because of the crown, I don't give full stars, but for the price I paid at Amazon, 3 stars is good enough.Hi there, this is just an after review. I would like to know if anyone has really tried the watch on the water. Thank you. Aug 30th, 2012"
2,"medida diferente del reloj,y falta peso del reloj en la descripcion","el reloj pone que tiene 39mm,y resulta que tiene 37mm,es demasiado pequeño para ser de hombre,y le falta poner en los relojes el peso que tiene completo,es importante a la hora de elegir."
4,a little small,"a little small but good for this price, in all it is worth to buy for those who love exquisite watches"
4,Good price,"Satisfied with the purchase. Its my first time going for Invicta watches and I am satisfied with what i got so far. The size is wonderful, its just the size i want. I am 5.11"" athletic build btw. I would definitely recommend this watch."
3,It is ok for me,"It is ok for meI think the price is good for the quality,I will use the watch every day."
2,got time?,"The watch was decently priced, looks good, but doesn't keep the correct time. What the heck? If I really used it as a dive watch I'd probably already have died from lack oxygen."
2,Look up a Rolex Submariner,"This watch is nothing but a copy. What on Earth is the point in buying a fake Rolex that doesn't even say Rolex on it?If you want to impress your friends, go to Chinatown and get a real fake Rolex."
2,dont get cheat by seeing the image,i saw the image and thought it would be looking very good.. but when i got the parcel and open it i dont have any words from my mouth. i was very disappointed. so plz be careful in choosing cloth accessories in amazon or any other website. because it will be good once we wear it and check it out.
1,too many Invictas,I will never own an Invicta. Too many models and too many variations of the same model. Invicta has oversaturated the market and there is nothing special about owning one. Too common. I like how Seiko and Orient only have 2 or 3 color schemes of one model of watch.
1,STOPPED WORKING AFTER ONLY 3 DAYS!!!,IT LOOKS GOOD BUT IT JUST DOES NOT WORK....I MEAN THIS A CHEAP WATCH BUT STILL INVICTA QUALITY USED TO BE GOOD FOR ITS CHEAPEST WATCHESTOO..... I DONT KNOW PERSONALLY IM TIRED OF INVICTA'S DOWNGRADING QUALITY. LOOK FOR ANOTHER WATCH.
4,Very Nice Daily Watch,If you work in a corporate environment this is a very nice elegant yet inexpensive watch to wear daily to work. The movement is smooth and the watch looks great overall. Solid but not heavy and the face is clean and easy to read - I really like the magnified date window inset.
1,Invicta 8932 or 8932A,"Right out of the attractive box the watch's sweep hand stuck around the 25 min mark. I might have to replace the battery, but certainly have to replace two links on the band. Why should i have to contend with that. Why was this watch marked 8932A. Was it because the sweep hand would stick at the 25 min mark? I don't know. I'm sending it back."
1,Received Watch is Not Brand New,"I received my Invicta 8932 watch today (May 15, 2010; ordered on May 7, 2010). I was shocked to discover that the watch is not brand new: There is no protective cover on the watch band and no little yellow Invicta tag attached to the band. The watch itself was not even inserted correctly in the box: The yellow sponge block is supposed to be bounded by the watch band; instead, the entire watch was placed under the sponge block (i.e., after opening the watch box I did not find the watch immediately. It was hidden under the sponge block). All these evidence suggest that the watch is either a customer return or someone has tempered with it.I have bought several Invicta watches from Amazon so I know in what shape a new Invicta watch should arrive. I am very disappointed this time and the experience really hurts my trust on Amazon."
2,A watch not for me.,The watch is smaller than specs. and is like a woman with bad reputation...............I return it.
5,Great watch for the money.,Fit and finish is great. The glow in the dark lasts a long time. Seems accurate so far It is still spot on with my cellphone. I really like the glow in the dark dot on the second hand. The all stainless construction is another reason I bought it. Base metal cases and I don't work well together.
4,Like the watch,I bought this watch for myself as a replacement for Model 5107 which I broke the stem on. This watch has a smaller face which I didn't like. I bought myself another very similar one with a larger face and gave this one to my dad. He loves it! Win-win!
2,Metal Needs Better Finishing,"The watch looks great. It mimics the classic Rolex Submariner design and is very inexpensive. When I wear it on my wrist, I can feel that some of the edges on the case back, lugs and bracelet poke my skin especially when it slides slightly up and down my wrist. Next time, I'll spend a little more to get a watch that's more comfortable and go for a more established brand."
2,Very poor quality.........,I purchased 4 of these watches as gifts however the build quality is very inconsistent and not up to gifting quality. The Cyclops on all 4 watches was in a different alignment. 2 had case blemishes. The endlinks didn't match up as I would expect. Even at this price a Fossil watch is a much better choice in my opinion.
2,Invicta watches,"I ordered three Invicta Watches last Christmas, and everyone ofthe bands have broken. The watch itself has done all right, but the bands are really cheap."
2,Breaking watch pins! Not a screw-down crown. Reasonable value.,"I bought this as a cheap alternative for daily wearing, to avoid any damage on my far finer Tag diver watch. The watch looks and wears well, but it's noticeably less solid feeling than my tag. For $60, I think it's a great value. The only real problem is that the item description says ""screw down""; it's actually push down, without any real screwing involved.--UPDATE--The watch band broke about 5 months after I purchased it. It was $10 to fix. You get what you pay for. Changed review from 4 stars to 3.--UDATE--The watch band broke again in the same place, right where the chain attaches to the main watch body. Marked it down to 2 stars. This may be happening because of my lifting at the gym, but it never happened with my Tag Heur so I think that it's a design flaw of some kind."
2,Beautiful watch - but quality control is a bet,"I got one of the failures; the screw crown wouldn't tighten, and the second hand wasn't aligned to the hash marks. Since I didn't use it I can speak to the accuracy, but just out of the box it's gorgeous and a nearly perfect dive watch (thanks for the design Rolex). At the price, if you get a keeper you made a heck of a deal, but you're taking your chances. I still gave it two stars, if you get one that works right you'll give it six."
3,"Unfortunate for Amazon, Very nice watch.",Purchased this watch to dive with and unfortunately the watch does not have a screw down crown as stated in the description. If you're just going to wear it as an everyday watch I think it will do fine. I can't comment on the water resistance component because I returned the watch.
5,Excellent choice,"I purchased this watch a few weeks ago as a first-anniversary gift for my husband. He absolutely loves this one. It's classy and elegant but not too pretentious. He wears it every day and says it's really comfortable. We still have to take it to have a few links removed, but after that, it should fit him perfectly. My husband is very picky about watches; he can't stand heavy or oversized faces and wide bracelets. The size on this one was perfect for him. We're both very happy with it. It arrived precisely when I was told it would and in perfect shape. Also, this was the cheapest price I could find it for online. Overall, we're very pleased."
1,Can't loose the crown,I bought an Invicta 8932 and nobody could loose the crown! That was so firmly attached to the body of the watch that I have to use pliers to switch the crown to be able to pull it and adjust the date and time. But it works fine. I gave 1 star but the clock deserves 4.
1,1st piece died and second piece has slow movement.,"My first piece just stopped and without a warranty it was a goner. This second piece from Amazon was okay for 10 months until it slowed down. I replaced the battery but after a week, it again slowed down. I bought the batteries the same time as the watch. It should have lasted longer. I am ordering newer batteries before I send it for my 5 year warranty repair."
3,"Decent, but you get what you pay for","I'm a watch enthusiast, and to be honest, when I saw the cost of the watch as opposed to the way it looked and was described, I wanted to have it instantly.First, it's a decent watch. It's well made, and generally decent. However, it doesn't come close to the quality of the Swiss timepieces it emulates. I've found that the battery operated watch loses time fairly rapidly, 5 minutes in about 3-4 months. It has a clear watch face and is good looking, but it is nowhere near the class and style of a Tissot, or a Titan.You get what you pay for!"
4,Not a Screwdown crown! it's push pull!,"Am I missing something here? The crown on the invicta watch that I received was a push-pull, but when I look at the older comments, there are people who say it and confirm that it's push pull. Did invicta change the crown on this watch recently? overall it is a very nice looking watch, the band seems a little loose and flimsy, but nothing that would make it seem like it would break on a whim."
5,loved it,this was a gift for my dad and be absolutely loved it! it's elegant and manly lol. it's a great product.
5,Very nice :),"I bought this for my fiance and he really loves it! Its high quality, packed well.Adding and removing links is difficult, but not impossible."
2,Disappointed,I ordered this watch as a gift for my son who was graduating from the police department who wanted the Invicta watch. When I got it I noticed the second hand on this watach was very loose and moving by itself. I could not give it to my son and I was very disappointed that I had to send it back. I just thought this watch was a better made watch.
1,JUNK JUNK JUNK,"I received this watch for my birthday. It was bought two months in advance so it could no longer be returned to Amazon. (Nice policy by the way, we will never be buying ahead again.) It worked while in the box. The minute it was placed on my wrist to actually wear it it stopped. It would restart again and run but it basically does what other reviewers have said. It stops at times and just keeps lousy time.I bought a junk watch from ebay from China for $4.95 including shipping and it hasn't missed a beat. Outperforms this dud. hate this watch with a passion AVOID AVOID AVOIDDO NOT BUY DO NOT BUYBTW Invicta wants to charge $25.00 for me to ship their broken piece of crap back to them. HA"
1,Lost Money awful,"good AfternoonI bought this watch for my husband and never served from the first day was late and stopped my husband was trying to work but it was impossible, I regret buying this watch."
2,Invicta Mens 8932,I wasn't impressed with this watch and have returned it. Stupidly ordered it with out reading the numerous bad reviews. Like many of the reveiws i later read the cyclops on this watch wasn't straight and it felt cheap. (guess you get what you pay for?) Bought a Seiko SKX007K insted which I love.
1,Invicta automatic watch doesn't keep time after 18 months use,"I bought this watch hoping that if I paid more my watch would last longer. After less than 18 months use, this watch looses hours and is no longer reliable. Invicta wants a check of $28 just to receive the watch (parts extra) and for that price, it is better to purchase a cheaper watch- it will last the same amount of time. I am very disappointed with this supposedly ""good"" brand."
5,"Great clock, Muy buen reloj","I bought this watch invicta because they are quality products, and before I bought a Prodriver very good, I like this model because it looks like the Rolex, but at a very low cost and good quality ..He comprado este reloj invicta porque son productos de calidad, ya anteriormente he comprado un prodriver muy bueno, me gusta mucho este modelo porque luce como el rolex pero a un muy bajo costo y muy buena calidad.."
1,Worst. Watch. Ever.,"This is the worst watch I have ever owned. It doesn't keep time worth a damn, and the day function never works. I will never buy another Invicta watch."
2,It's OK,I've always liked the Rolex style but never wanted to pay the Rolex price. Found this at a discount and went for it. It's light and doesn't feel very sturdy. As such I didn't trust it could hold up as well as my REACTOR or Timex Ironman so I returned it. This might be a good starter for a young man but I wouldn't put it in as grown-up watch collection.
1,Nice watch when it works,"I got this Invica Men's 8932 watch, but fron the time I took it out of the box it would stop everyday.I finally took it to the watch repair man and he fixed it. It seems to be a problem with many of these models.I think Invicta and Amazon ought to be ashamed to sell this watch knowing it has this defect."
3,Looks nice,"Looks like a rolex. Accurate time keeping not a strong suit, seems to always lose 5mins over the course of a month, so always need to readjust the time."
2,Stunning.......but not reliable,"This is a beautiful watch.....well designed exterior, polished stainless steel, just a great look. That is where the praise ends for me. After about a week, the watch lost about 35 minutes of time overnight. I was really bummed because I really wanted this watch to work out. It is just very attractive. If you are on the fence like I was after reading the reviews, I would choose something else. It has some kind of design flaw with the quartz ""motor"". I ended up returning the one I ordered. I won't be ordering anything from Invicta again. Amazon should really consider NOT selling this watch with all of the problems others have had."
2,"Beautiful, but!","I am returning this watch today. Sorry to do it because it is a handsome timepiece. Several problems: the crown when it's pulled in the adjustment mode seems very loose and this make it somewhat difficult to set the hour hand precisely.Also in the adjustment mode the hour hand is actually loose and flops around a little when I turn the watch.This is probably nitpicking, but the quartz movement gains several seconds a day. Really no big deal, but I had several quartz watches that were much more accurate.In any case this watch is going back today but I ordered another Invicta, trusting I will have better luck with it."
1,Not a diver's watch!,Crown does not screw down so contrary to Invicta' claims this is not a diver's watch.Amazon's return policy is brilliant and there was no argument about replacing the watch.
1,Poor excuse for a watch & poor service,The watch stopped within the first 30 days and I should have returned it but since it started up again I kept it. It stopped frequently and the last time it stopped I could not reset the time because the stem had fallen out - sent it in for service and Invicta wanted $126 + postage to repair. I told them to keep the watch.
3,Average daily watch,"It is cheap feeling, and you notice it when you sent the time. it looks good, but is a little small. It is a decent watch. Nothing special."
2,Too small!,"This is one of several Invictas I've purchased, and I've been pretty impressed. However, this model is so small that it hardly qualifies as a men's watch--and I'm a fairly short guy. I've seen watches this size advertised as ladies' models.The second problem with this watch is the clasp. It almost takes a pair of pliers to loosen the safety clasp. While it's nice to have a tight fit, when you can't take the watch off, it's a problem.Timekeeping is fine, and I still recommend Invicta watches to others. But unless you're a really small guy, this watch is simply too small for wearing. (You could, however, give it to your wife or girlfriend;)"
4,Very good watch,"It's an elegant watch, small 38mm of diameter, cheap and good quality.Pros:- Elegant- Cheap- Small (38mm) and beautifulCons:- Quartz- Very simple, just show the day, not months, chronometer, etc.- The light at night is very poor."
4,Nice affordable watch,"Invicta's 8932 is a very classy-looking watch for the price. Dial is smaller than I hoped for, and the watch is not too heavy. Construction quality appears to be good, apart from the clasp which seems a bit flimsy. I've owned the watch for a week and it keeps time very well; I hope it's not too early to tell! Bottom line: Great looking dive watch that goes well when a dress-up look is needed."
2,Not pleased,I bought this watch as a gift for my husband for Christmas. Two days after I gave it to him it stopped working. Thinking it my be the battery I changed it out for a new one. That did not work. Now I have to send it in to have fixed. I was so disappointed. It is a beautiful watch but I will never buy one again.
1,didnt like it at all,"watch is ugly , made cheaply , and for 50 dollars that is all your going to get , is so small the watch that it looks like a womens watch , the bracelet is horrible , imo waste of money do not buy"
5,invicta men watch,"First I feel hesitated to buy it, then after I read the review I tried it. It's worth it. It is a good watch so far. Runs well, accurate time compared with atomic wall clock. Recommended."
3,"Case diameter is 39mm, not 43mm like the 8926","(EDIT: Amazon now has the specs correctly listed at 37mm diameter.)Amazon's description is wrong on the case diameter. I bought this watch and the 8926 automatic thinking they were the same size (43mm with crown). Not so, this watch is quite a bit smaller on the wrist, not as heavy(no automatic movement), and the unidirectional bezel is much more loose and cheap feeling.The model # on the back of this watch is 8932AThe 8926 is a MUCH nicer watch and has been on sale for 70 at various times."
1,Bad Product. Not water resistant.,"The product description says the watch is water resistant up to 200 meters (600 feet). However, I use this watch for around 1 and half month and water has gone into the watch already. I didn't wear the watch to swim or take shower. I just use it normally and sometimes I wear it when I wash hands. How dare they say the watch is water resistant?"
1,very dissapointed,"first watch got water inside the first time I got in the pool. The replacement did not run properly, some times run behind and some times it just stopped altogether."
2,Reliability in Question,"I received my watch yesterday. My expectation on the looks was right on. I like it but I am writing this review to inform all that the watch was not working properly. It was interesting that all the reviews on this watch did not indicate its realiblity from the get go. It would stop intermittently and would lose time. I would need to reset it and it would start again. I am not sure if it is the battery or... I called Invicta but after 15 minutes on hold, I decided to just ask for a replacement from Amazon instead. Wish me luck on the replacement, I like the looks but I would like a working watch too."
5,Why I ike my INvicta wristwatch,Very fine timepiece. I like a good sized wrist watch and this is just the right size without being heavy.I also did not want a watch that had several other functions than telling time - and this one fits the bill.
5,Nice Watch,"I bought this watch for my brother, and he says he loves it, he even threw away his other watch. For the price I would say it is an excellent deal, however do not try to compare a quartz Invicta to a Rolex or Omega"
2,Keep looking,"I bought this watch a few months ago and would not recomend the product. The feel is cheap, band and clasp very light and hard to unclasp."
2,Invicta look vs. feel,"This watch was one I wanted as a backup for my Rolex GMT-II that needed a bracelet replaced. I had another Invicta previously which was very nice, waterproof, heavier bracelet, etc. That's what I thought I was buying with the 8932 model. Unfortunately it is not as heavy and the face is slightly smaller. My fault for not truly measuring. The actual one I found at SAM's Club for $109. I highly recommend it and made the purchase for myself (as backup). Quality is fine, just the weight and face size is smaller than I expected (for less than $75 one cannot complain - I would rather have had the $109 model from the start)."
4,good price,"A very pretty Watch for men and a gread price, an de deliver was very fast . Five day to my door in chile"
1,piece of crap!,"This is my second (and last) Invicta watch,the battery had to be changed after about two months,after about 3-4 months the band broke,and had to be repaired.I rarely wore the watch,as it was supposed to be my ""good watch"",my $40 casio has held up 3 years with no problems,and the battery is guaranteed for ten years,it also has a similar band.My advice either buy a cheaper brand that you can just toss out ,because it will be too much to repair,or step up quite a bit in price,for something else.Even tho there is a warranty,they still charge you at least $28.00 to ship it to and from Invicta,(half the price of this watch)I am going to smash mine with a 22oz. hammer and at least get my moneys worth out this watch."
3,clasp too tight,Its a nice watch...the only thing I have an issue with is the clasp is too tight. Its to tight to take off...feels kind of cheap.
4,Handsome and functional,"The size and weight of the watch are perfect for what I need. The price was reasonable. Durability TBD. The time and sweep second hands are easy to see and read. Seeing the numerals and hands in the dark... I have had better.What I don't like, the date numerals are hard to read unless you are right over the magnifier window in the crystal. At an angle, forget it. Also, I need to remove a link for sizing. I have fully adjusted the clasp adjustment, but it is still too sloppy. The huge manual does not provide any clues for sizing the band. I am not able to pop the pins in the band to remove a link. The pins in the clasp were a breeze. I suspect I will have to add the cost of a visit to a watchmaker or jeweler to the cost of the watch.MAK"
4,"Excelente reloj, acabados perfectos. Un poco pequeño","Excelente reloj, acabados perfectos. Muy elegante y fuerte. Un poco pequeño, esperaba fuera un poco mas grande. Lo recomiendo."
5,beautiful watch,"if you like a classic design, solid construction this is it. I have had it for several months now and its definitely a winner. Also, price is unbeatable."
1,FAKE FAKE FAKE!!!!!!!,i was soo happy that there was such a nice watch and it looks real but its not. the price itself is a rip off these are watches are made in hong kong if real they would come with a certificate saying its real sooo mad and mad at amazon for letting fake watches be sold.
2,"Pretty, but pretty useless",This is an attractive watch with a comfortable heft to it. If you want a fashionable watch with diver-watch style this is an ok route to go. With regular wear it will probably last a couple of years before it breaks.However:1. The quality of workmanship is shaky2. The band clasp is of very low quality metal3. Do NOT trust this as an actual divers-watch. It will leak and you will die.
2,"A Good Start, But Lacks Depth","I bought this book on the strength of the Amazon reccomendations.If you don't know anything about XDoclet, or you don't like working from the online documentation, then you need this book. But if your a real world working developer who is hoping for a quick, detailed jumpstart then you will be disappointed.I feel the book starts well, but quickly becomes superficial and only addresses easy topics. For illustration, consider that entity bean relationships get less than two pages and a weak example. In comparison, ""Enterprise Java Beans"" by Monson-Haefel devotes a whole chapter to entity bean relationships.I feel this book would be much improved if the Blog example was more fully developed and the source was available (as O'Reilly does).As it stands, I'm still poking through the sample code provided w/XDoclet and creating small test applications to see what is generated. Too bad the book didn't answer my questions and save me some time."
5,XDoclet in Action is a must-have for all Java developers,"Manning has done it again! XDoclet in Action is a must-have for all Java developers. Craig Walls and Norman Richards have toiled long and hard to create this masterpiece. ""All you need to know about J2EE, you can learn from this book"". Each chapter is not about code generation, it is about solving problems we face as Java developers. If you are frustrated by the duplicate manual work you face in your development efforts, XIA will help. My favorite quote from the book: ""Don't generate what you don't understand."" - this shines through in each section, as each technology (EJB, web, JMX, mock objects, Hibernate, etc) is presented accurately and clearly first as it stands alone, then the problem of the real-world enter the picture, followed by the solutions XDoclet brings to the situation."
5,"All cool stuff, serious book to serious Java developer","When reading one of the reviews about this book before buying, I hisitated a little due to someone made it ""down"". But where is the other option. I got this book and started reading it...I cannot put it down. This book is really good one if you are serious J2EE developer and if you've been following up with most of cool Java technologies. The writing style and techical part of this book should be a model for most of those books about J2EE. This book helps me brush up J2EE from frontend to backend, with a lot of little trick and details I cannot get from XDoclet's website.If you are J2EE developer, a serious one, you must get this book! It not only helps you create code, but it creates thoughts!"
4,Memorable Music!,"I can't get these songs out of my head! From the first moment I heard Andy Hopping's CD, I was singing along. His music and voice are soothing, toe-tapping, and...yes, full of heart!-- Mary"
2,Could have tweaked a whole lot more,"2 1/2Like the poor man's UNKLE, Tweaker employs multiple guest-spots and generates just enough ""diversity"" to keep things from becoming lobotomized. Compositionally, this plodding techno has the songwriting finesse of a teenaged experimenter, getting by on enough production to barely even be deemed average."
3,pretty good,This CD was at it's best when there were vocals. It had too many instramentals. I've had it a few days and I've narrowed it down to about 5 go to songs...3 of which are fantastic. Could have been better.
3,It's ok...,"This movie is good. I liked wehn the limbs got blowed off real good. If there was a better movie, then I gonna see real good, uh huh. Yo yo yo, that was phat. Guarunndeddttedd. When da bombs , killeded da persons, that was real real good, uh huh. Yahoo!"
4,Comprehensive Ghostwriting Guide,"As a Certified Lifewriting Instructor, I am occasionally hired to capture the memoirs of clients who want their stories preserved but are unable or unwilling to write them. Ghostwriting by Andrew Crofts was the most comprehensive guide that I have been able to locate, and I especially appreciated Chapter 6-Contracts--Do You Need Them? This book is a MUST for serious, career ghostwriters."
4,"Family, friends, and war","The young men go away to war but family and life still goes on.The story shifts from one era to another to give the reader an idea of how a veteran feels while at war and again when they are back at home, many years later.This is a story of the effects and the memory of war and the lost innocense of young men. The sadness that stays with a war veteran during his daydreaming of fighting and fear.A very worthwhile book to read.A lot of different emotions and outcomes are entwined through this story of family, love, and war."
3,A brave effort that doesn't make it,"The first three quarters of this book are excellent, if a bit difficult to follow due to time changes and information that is left out for later. But overall I liked it. The last 1/4 is a bore. The same emotions repeated and the same family interactions with no one really growing or changing. Everyone resigned to the status quo. The mother is particularly unlikable. No way for me to know if the WWII stuff is accurate. I wasn't alive."
5,"I've chewed this gum many times, but used?","Nothing against the product, but it does bother me that there is a link at the top of the page for me to buy it USED. ;)Does your chewing gum lose it's flavor on the bedpost overnight?Andy in Alaska"
3,Too slow....then too fast. Difficult read.,"Long, unnecessary first half, with too many chartacters and point of views. The first part of the story is a step by (unecessary) step of the first half of Ladd's & Laurette's lives. The setting could have been portrayed in half the time, and the author should have delved into the guts of the plot much earlier on. The character development (after all that) still seemed vague. But when the story really did start to ""kick"", with a bitter Ladd (Sutton) returned home, it became interesting, but the ending was aprupt and sudden and very anticlimactic. It had such potential! A very difficult read and no gratification. The author should have done a little more editing to perfect this story."
2,Scandelous Miss Ryan,"I am a long time fan of Nan Ryan's. However, her new book The Scandelous Miss Howard, falls short of her usual caliber. The story line is an interesting one, but she fails to put much depth into her characters, or into their interaction. I am just disappointed at how similar this story parallels that of ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" by Alexander Dumas. Right down to the map to the stolen conferderate money. Not very original."
4,"2"" Cervicle collar","this is a comfortable collar, and is as stated. very reasonably priced. adjusts to fit well. i am a woman and this collar was just the right height for my neck.i am pleased."
5,Comfort,"I bought 2 of these, one for myself and another as a gift after i pinched a nerve in my neck. They help stabilize neck area. The part that touches skin is 100% cotton, making it very comfy and non irritating to skin. Great value too."
4,Support,"Good Support, to big though. It is to still to get in a circle for neck. But does support back, just sits across my face. Does relieve neck stress."
5,Carex Cervical Collar,I am recovering from major cervical fusion and the collarI was sent home with from the hospital had already lostit's ability to stay closed after 6 months. This one is waybetter and probably much cheaper as well.
3,I need a firmer collar,If you need a softer collar this is excellent. Its a good one for sleeping but I needed a firmer one for daytime.
5,Good Value,"I have cervical stenosis and use one of these while sleeping. It has stood up well to several washings (just make sure you mate the strap surfaces before washing,l they will hold). No color dye nonsense to worry about. Good value for the money."
1,Too stiff for sleeping,"I got this for sleeping on flights because I'm sure many of you know, a constantly dropping head is annoying and painful. However, this was too stiff (uncomfortably so) for sleeping. It was also too high for me (3"" from collar bone to chin)."
5,Capoeira plus,"I enjoyed the more modern rhythms to the great berimbau ones. There was a lot of roda-ready capoeira music. I like to work out to it. My friends and I think its great for the jogo because it has a nice pace, and its makes you wanna move."
5,A awesome soundtrack!,"After I saw the movie I had to get the soundtrack and the movie was so awesome, It would be cool if it was a true story."
4,Early TVA History,"If you ever want to know about how great TVA is and how it got it start and its struggles, this is the book. It really put thing in perspective about TVA in its early years.Its really a shame that in today's society, this idea would not work. TVA is really for the people and by the people from day 1."
4,good for you and good for your camera equipment,"This filter is great and I leave it on my camera 24-7. When I need to switch to a polarizing filter, I just screw that filter on and leave the haze-2A on. Not only does it keep your pictures crystal clear and crisp, but it also protects your camera. I do think it does affect your pictures more than the Haze- 1 filter as far as blocking out Uv rays, but for this price, it's worth it. Great to protect that expensive lens or even that inexpensive lens on your camera."
5,Brilliant - Tool is pure genius,"Beautiful. It is impossible to say whether it is better or worse than AEnima or Opiate. Undertow is an excellent album by an incredible band. Tool is amazing, with burning guitars, chilling vocals, and fantastic bass and drums. They are very talented musically and this album is very deep and has a lot of meaning (AEnima has even more). From the opening, the sharp ""Intolerance"", to the 10+ minute monster ""Disgustipated"", this album is a must-have."
3,Captain crunch,"3 1/2In many ways a precursor to what is largely considered their masterwork, Undertow simply does not have the melodic heft of its successor, but as far as stricter power-chord, crunch-driven affairs go, rarely had the language sounded so appealing, if repeating."
4,pretty good,"This one is probably tool's 2nd best CD. I'd recommend aenima before you get this one, but this should definitely be next on your list if you don't have it already. Sober and swamp song are both pretty cool. All the other stuff is pretty good too, but not as good as some of the songs from aenima. All in all, it's definitely worth spending money on, so I would definitely recommend this one."
5,A BREAKTHROUGH ALBUM OF TREMENDOUS CIRCUMFRENCE,"It was with the introduction of Tool's second album, ""Undertow,"" and the accompanying video for the song ""Sober"", that most fans first became aware of the band. On this album, Tool introduced an unorthodox sound that was is in its own right a genre of its own. This is probably Tool's heaviest album to date, with its metal influence showing through very clearly. ""Undertow's"" sound is primarily rhythmical, featuring powerful, snakelike beats, accompanyed by the soft, yet explosive vocals of Maynard James Keenan. ""Undertow"" was received with a sigh of relief in a time when radio stations where oversatured with Seattle grunge and its many imitators. This album is a must have for the record collection of any seriouse cutting edge music fan."
5,THe Best?,Some people say this is Tools best I would say that its between this and the masterpeice known as AENMIA.Undertow has more of a hardcore feel to it than Aenmia. The first song Intolerence is a great song and so is the next one Prison Sex. Sober the third song is addictive and has a powerful message. The next song Bottom features guest vocals by none other than Henry Rollins.The rest of the songs are just as good as the ones I mentioned but im too lazy to talk about them although Swamp Song and Disgustipated are defnitly worth mentioning. If your thinking about geting into Tool but not sure what album to start out with I recomend Undertow and once you get sucked into the wonderful world of Tool go buy Aenmia.
5,The first LP from a brilliant group of musicians,"In the years since Undertow, no band has ever successfully imitated Tool's sound or ideology, but that's not to say that none ever tried. The last album with original bassist Paul D'Amour focuses more on the guitar-based rock of Tool of yore, rather than the quieter, prettier, more manipulated, deadlier-sounding emotional progressive metal they're writing these days. Maynard Keenan provides vocals ranging from a whisper to a guttural scream, and Adam Jones, Paul, and Danny Carey do their best to keep up. This is also probably their most radio-friendly and accessible recording, lacking the 9- and 10-minute dirges and bizarre instrumental noise-tracks of later masterpieces Aenima and Lateralus.Standout tracks here include Prison Sex, Flood, Sober, and Bottom. If you're a fan of Tool's later work, you may or may not like this album, but if you're a fan of Tool's later work, it's probably because you were already a fan of Undertow."
4,Nice,"This is probably the darkest Tool album in their catalog. To me, Maynard's vocals on this album sound like he's suffering instead of moving with the music, and this compliments the emotion of the music perfectly. Songs like Prison Sex, Disgustipated and the ""hit"" Sober are all about emotion and sadness. This is the album that got me into Tool, which are my favorite band of all time. I guess I could thank the idiot that broke my heart and got me to hear Sober a billion times."
4,Not as good as Aenema....,"..But still excellent. Tool never cease to amaze me, with their strong and emotional songwriting abilities every song is a hit. One of the only bands still worth listening to."
5,Tool is the best hard rock band around,"I saw Tool play about two years ago in Wash. D.C. The show was one of the best I've ever seen. Maynard had painted his body completely blue on one side and the other was painted white. Words can't explain the performance they gave. I know this has nothing to do with the album Undertow, but I don't care. The album, which I've had for many years now, is one of my all time favorites. It's is definetley a great album. I'm wondering when they will put out a follow-up to Aenima, and possibly if they will be touring again soon. Somebody fill me in."
4,good but sometimes too fast,"I think that this is a great album with a lot of emotion behind it's lyrics. But I also think that the beat in some of the songs is too fast. The best songs are Sober, Swamp Song, and Disgustipated."
4,worth the money,"This review is from someone who only has 1 Tool cd, so if you're a huge fan, you may want to look at another review for deeper insight. I was in college when this cd came out, and 2 songs that still play great today are ""Sober"" and ""Prison Sex"". These 2 songs made the purchase worth the money for me, while the rest of the cd is ok. If you buy the cd, make sure you play Prison Sex really really loud!"
5,the best,"tool is by far my favorite band. their style is like no other bands. the lyrics are so deep and have meaning behind them. all the songs are great but crawl away, sober and swamp song are the best. any one who loves rock and metal should buy this cd. every musician in tool is so unbelievable. being a musician myself i apreciate their talent. one of the best cds ever!"
5,This is definately the best band yet!!!!!,"This is a got to have cd, it's packed with awsome lyrics and a good vocalist to back it up, what really gets me to like tool is the ""fact"" that the band never gets old, the cd's seem to change every time you listen to them they are so packed with mind boggling lyrics and head rushing guitar riffs that you hear something new every time you hit play, so i recommend that you buy this cd and the other two (opiate,and nima)"
5,CD is Unmatched!,"One of the best cd's ever! It may take a few weeks to understand, but then it's unbelievable! Tool is one of the most unique bands out there. Notice that all Tool's albums and EP's are 5 STARS! You must have this cd in any rock/metal music collection. It deals with religion, emotion, mentality,and is also humorous. The Undertow videos are awsome too. This cd is for anyone who doesn't mind thinking a little."
4,just my kind of music,"tool is a band that truly has their own sound. Undertow is nothing short of exceptional. this CD, like all tool, has to grow on you . I know no one who liked tool on their first listen."
3,"overrated, but not bad - 3 1/2 stars","this is, in my opinion, tool's weakest album, but it's not bad. it starts off strong with ""intolerance,"" ""prison sex"" and ""sober."" it slows down a little for the mediocre ""bottom"" but gains momentum again with the pretty good ""crawl away."" but then it's back down again with ""swamp song.""this album's weakness is tool's tendency to get ""bogged down"" with the song structures. some of this was intentional due to the subject matter, but just because a song is called ""flood"" or ""swamp song"" doesn't mean you should feel like you're hearing it from inside a swamp! they should have added more interesting parts to the songs like on aenima (my favorite tool album) or even made them straightforward hard rock songs like on opiate.so.. 6 great songs + 3 OK songs + 1 song that's not even a song (disgustipated) = 3 1/2 stars."
5,My all time favorite band,"Well maybe reading the heading you would see that Tool is my favorite band and good reason why, they came out with Sober and I was hooked.Well many people might label Tool nu-metal simply because Tool came out near the start of nu-metal but Tool came out 2 years before. Another thing is, it doesn't sound a thing like nu-metal. no rapping, no downtuned guitars, and no self pity lyrics(read the music first). These songs are very psychedelic and hypnotising, the type of music you can get lost to. Maynard James Keenan has a voice that Vilo Varnis(whatever his name is from HIM) wishrd he had his style, voice, ability to freak out people, and his popularity in and respect in the metal community. Adam jones has some killer riffs,"
5,Tool.....noone else compares,"Tool came into the music world in the 90's when i was young. I first heard Tool and thought the lyrics were terrible. When entering my teen years, the lyrics fit into everyday life. This cd is one of the best if not the best 90's metal cd. Each song includes a complicated musical arragement that no other band compares to. The Undertow cd is a great cd to just sit back and listen to. Adam Jones (guitarist) explores the songs of drop tuning to a B. While the bassist may use simpilier bass lines the fluidity of the bass is amazing. Danny Carey (drummer) is by far the best drummer on the scene, anything from double bass to hi-hat properties are taken care of. While Maynard (lyricist) is hands down the best singer as far as dynamics to his voice all the way to his ability to scream at the top of his lungs and still sound great. OVERALL Undertow is a great Tool Cd, and i suggest all the other Tool cd's as well. None will dissapoint you."
3,what an album!!!!!10 stars,I love this cd and all the songs.Get blown away by sober and prison sex.It will really blow you away.ROCK ON .........hi mom:)
1,"Its boring...Realy, boring.","Your a tool if you like tool...First of all, i dont know what posses kids to wear korn t-shirts, mudvayne t-shirts to real extreme real concers in the first place ?! Tool's music is just plain horrible,boring,unspering,no-talent and is not difirent then your paparoach,korn,avril, & the list goes on & on!For good talented music do not search for tool or any nu-metal band or cd in the first place--go else or better ? Search my music and maiby you'll learn about talent music."
1,Paxil Lovers,"Music for the paxil overdosed and misguided. A little talent in the drum department does not mean this band is progressive. After I heard this I thought I needed paxil. I honestly cannot believe King Crimson opened for this garbage. I guess they thought they could ride the coattails of this popular band. Yes, millions can be wrong including pedroza, daniel aka pebozo."
5,Truly amazing,"Tool should not be classified as a rock band. They should be classified as an orchestra. The song writing in this album, I feel is bordering on (and i'm a violinist) the Mozart level. The way that they weave and twist the guitar melodies, drum beats, amazing vocals, and underlying bass rhythm is beyond me. Each song is a masterpiece, a journey. That's not all, the album as a whole, feels like one large, well, opera. Each song is perfectly placed, This cd was designed to be listened all of the way through, no shorter. The listener is taken on a journey as they flow through the truly original songs. And nothing is repetitive. Everything is in sync (no, not 'nsync). All I can say is that if you want to hear what a really true metal band sounds like, a band with amazing talent, a band that has the song writing capabilities with the likes of Led Zepplin, Lennon, and Metallica, all in one, Tool is what you need. If you like this, Aenima is even a more must buy."
4,Tool with more of an emphasis on metal,"If you are trying to get in to Tool and found nima and Lateralus to be a little too wierd, than this is perhaps the album for you. It has it's out there moments (disgustipated anyone?), but for the most part, it's very good, agressive rock/metal. Sober was the single, and I'm sure most have heard it at some point, but the hi-lites of the album for me are 4, Swamp Song & Flood, which all wouldn't have been too out of place on nima.I personally rate both nima & Lateralus above this album (I prefer the strangeness of them both, along with the longer tracks and increased sophistication of the song writting), but this is where the egg of Tool was really hatched, and it certainly hints at what is to come."
4,Raw,"Again, another brilliant Tool album, but I suggest not getting the earlier albums until you have at least listened to Lateralus.This album is more raw than either AEnima or Lateralus,in that there are more wicked guitar riffs and less experimental sounds. But, again, be warned, homophobes; there's a lot of very suggestive m/m lyrics in here. The best track by far is ""Bottom"", followed by ""Prison Sex"" and the hilarious last track ""Disgustipated"". The only reason I gave this album four stars is because of its brevity...I had come to expect more from Maynard and Co. when it came to album length."
4,Very Good But Somewhat Repetitive,"In an age when metal is saturated with boring rap-metal [bands](e.g. Limp Bizkit, Disturbed, etc.) and bands who think being""hard"" and ""heavy"" guarantees good music when infact it does not (e.g. Slipknot, etc.), it's nice to see a band likeTool. The music is loud, yet melodic and the lyrics are angry, butinsightful and intelligent at the same time. Maynard is a verytalented singer while Adam and the rest of Tool showcase theirmusicianship. Tracks like ""Intolerance,"" ""PrisonSex,"" and ""Sober"" are Tool at theirbest. Unfortunately, the album begins to get a little monotonous aftertrack 6 or 7 as Tool doesn't seem to move away from their long, dark,and hard formula. The last track ""Disguspiated"" can be seenas either experimental greatness or a failed attempt at beingexperimental (I'm leaning towards the latter). Despite itsshortcomings, Undertow is still a very good album and Tool is a verygood band. Give this one a listen."
4,great cd,have been trying to get this cd for awhile love tool the reason that i didnt give this four stars is the case was badly broken but it still had a great looking cd and the insert wasnt beaten up to bad but watch who you get it from.
1,fake undertow vinyl,"so I get all excited & order the Vinyl album Undertow from the greatest band in the Universe, Tool.come to find out, this is a fake copy or something. It is a piece of crap & came w/ 2 discs.in short, total rip off. do not buy the undertow vinyl"
2,Borefest,"Sorry, this album didn't do much for me. Maybe because i heard the magnificent Lateralus before i heard this one. Now when people criticise Tool for songs sounding the same i'll know why. It's because of this album. The songs on this album are generally strong but thier is a real samey feeling about every one. The guitar's are in the same key in every song and they drag on for 6 minutes. Every song has the same angsty mood. I suggest you get Sober off the net and spend your money on Aenima or Lateralus rather than this mundane affair."
2,Binge and dirge,"Mediocre at best, but ""Undertow"" is far superior to Tool's later work. Torture victims from future albums will say: ""Wow! There are actually songs on this one!""I enjoyed some of it, and I would sell it to a store when I wanted to be rid of it, whereas I would chuck ""Aenima"" out the window of my car on the interstate and shout ... as it spun away. I guess that's a good thing."
2,Eh... it's...kinda okay...,"I just don't understand the appeal of this album. When this debuted, I picked it up on a whim, and hated it immensely, causing me to ignore Tool entirely for the next howevermany years. After finally listening to the excellent Aenima and Lateralus, returning to this actually removes the bias I once had, but that doesn't mean this is any good. Almost totally devoid of their later prog sound, I get bored almost instantly with their 'crash and yell' style of alt rock/metal. Somehow, I sat through this whole mess long enough to pick out a few sunspots. The drumming is decent, not on par with their newer sound, and the song Prison Sex, however obvious, isn't too bad of a song. Otherwise, the spoken portion of Bottom is incredibly stupid, and the meandering Disgustipated makes me want to tear my hair out in blood soaked clumps. I can't believe the praise this album recieves when Tool's future was so much brighter. Even Opiate was slightly better than this."
3,Undertow - By Tool,"I have really enjoyed several of the songs by Tool on the Undertow album. Not quite as many good ones as the 10,000 days album, but a very good album. I am sure some folks might like all of the songs. Just my opinion. Thanks"
5,Second Best Tool CD,"This CD is way better than Aenima however it still lacks what Lateralus has. This CD is creative, and if you buy the old version with a black CD tray lift it up there is a hidden picture. The best song: Prison Sex."
4,undisputed best Tool album,"I've never been a big fan of Tool, mainly because most would consider me ignorant, because I don't really understand the music. I do listen to them a lot though and I'll admit it is very very good. Undertow, I'd say, and apparently others would too, that this is Tool's best album. I like the songs on this c.d. much better than the others, and overall, I think they are better musically. Any music fan should buy this album."
3,"Tool's first LP, awesome.","Undertow is an amazing flat out Progressive hard rock which some called it alt. rock...whatever though, the band's hit song Sober was a big hit from the band and with Adam Jones's art work also got them high on the Billboard charts. Undertow was certified gold in 1994 and Their song Prison Sex struck up a whole world of censorship the song has nothing to do with the words in the song, its more like a Maynard/metaphor lol. Overall Undertow is a great Tool album."
3,Great Album,"A very powerful album for its time, Tool broke new ground with this album. The first few songs are the best. The album seems to taper off towards the end and gets a bit repetitive. Henry Rollins adds a few great words in the song ""Bottom"". If you like Sober, then you will definitely like this album. It rocks! If you don't like Tool's ""Artsy"" side, then get this album or Opiate. They are both more traditional sounding rock...but with an edge. A razor-sharp knife edge."
5,"A great Title by a Great Band, TOOL does it once again.","An album by Tool. That is all you need to know to buy it, but this is better than expected. From the boys who brought you Aenima, here is something you can't help but love. Tool has made something for all you people who are into any kind of punk or rock. Tool shows us once again why they will live on."
2,Great music but a bad pressing.,"I absolutely love Tool but I somewhat regret buying this LP. The light weight of the vinyl leaves me unsatisfied. Also, the labels look like they were applied by a three year old. The labels were sloppily pressed into the record, cut/torn and don't even feature any artwork (a little boring to look at)."
4,Maynard has a different style,"This CD is great...I learned about Tool through Rage Against the Machine (the best band in the universe.) I really like how Maynard sings, it's quite different than hearing Zach de la Rocha scream. I also think the humor is great. Buy the CD and you'll know what I mean."
2,Give it a miss,"This debut from Tool is overrated and is not as interesting as their other albums. The songs and vocals drag on in a repetetive and way and the is little going on to keep me listening.However, tracks like prison sex, sober and bottom are the best they have written - these display more dynamics and variation. Another strong point is that there are no ""filler"" segments like on ""aenima"" between tracks to distract you."
2,learn to swim...please,tool is boring to me i cant stand them except that one song learn to swim and the new one placabeo or whatever the hell they named itwhy do they have to be so damn complicated with choosing names dammit
3,TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.............,"I first heard about TOOL from a friend, and heard the song ""Sober"", and from there I fell in love with TOOL's sound. I expected the sound to be similar on the whole CD, but I was disappointed that many of the tracks sounded just like Tight Leather 80's music. Sober is by far the best song on the album, but the rest of the CD doesn't have much meaning. There lyrics are very powerful, but the music does not fit the style of the lyrics. I am really trying to like TOOL and relate with all the great hype about them, but just can't find it."
2,the one I liked the most?,"The riffs are good and simple with low driving bass lines, and the drums are decent, the pictures in the album are pulp fiction to me and the song ""sober"" is probably the most offbeat and power-ridden song on all their albums. I gave the album 2 stars because of my doing research into their band and found out that they are a bunch of intellects-- they are way too smart to be in heavy metal rock prog... blah blah blah. Ultimately I threw the album away."
2,Tool doesn't make it,"This is probably their best album, and it's still not that great. Why would anyone rather listen to this instead of ""Rein in Blood"" by Slayer, or ""Overkill"" by Motorhead, ""Number of the Beast"" by Iron Maiden, ""Kill 'em All"" by Metallica, ""Back in Black"" by AC/DC, or ""Masters of Reality"" by Black Sabbath ?? Sorry, but Tool are 2nd level musicians only."
5,Read the whole series,"When I picked up the first book, I wasn't sure. But as I got into it, I discovered characters who became real and had some depth, which surprised me. It surprised me because the books are full of action, fighting, details of an alien world and race, and I expected a page-turner without a lot of character depth. I was SO wrong.While you can read each book alone, you really should read the entire series and grow along with Prince Roger."
4,Quite Enjoyable,"Is this a great book in the sense that Frank Herbert's Dune is? No. Did I enjoy it more than books 3 and 4 in the Dune series? Yes. In fact, I had thought this would be the most enjoyable of the Prince Roger series, and, for me at least, it did not disappoint.Perhaps, as others here have said, some of the plot could have been better, but some of the characters more than made up for it. During the girlfriend rescue, for instance, there's this guy who keeps quoting movies and such. The only horrible sequence that stands out in my mind is when Roger does his meat-cutting routine. I liked the knife-wielding Rastar. His star-shaped meat shouldn't have been bested by Roger's octahedron-shaped meat."
1,A Mess,"Hard to say how these two authors could have gotten so far off track, but they did. Decent enough first three book's plot scatters off into subplots, tedious space battles orchestrated for mysterious purposes, mutinous Marines rallying behind a ""Prince of the Blood"", and the escape of a dimly seen evil personage. By far the weakest of the series and hardly a credit to either Webb's or Ringo's skills."
2,We Few has FEW things to recommend it,"This series has taken us to The Mountains, The Sea, The Stars and now The Pits.This is (in my humble opinion) the poorest of this series by Weber. I happen to be a Weber fan (which tells you that I don't mind some fluff in my books) because I like to be entertained and not have to focus too much on leisure reading.This book struck me from the 3rd or 4th page as just a way to finish a book and make money.Bad characters are TOO bad - action sequences are good, but that is this book's ONLY redeeming value.The things the BAD PEOPLE do is just beyond common sense and thebasic premise that a bunch of retired Veterans could take over a Galactic Empire is beyond LUDE-E-Crus if you know what I mean.I WOULD NOT purchase this book if I knew then what I know now.I own every book David Weber has written, but I would have skipped this one. I recommend you do so.Thanks for reading."
3,Good but could have been better,"This is a satisfying end to the series, but it was also the worst book of the series. Maybe the authors got run down after three volumes of action. It seemed to me that they wanted it to be over, and they were going to make it happen. They needed to resolve the tension between Roger and Nimashet, but they did it in an abrupt and unbelievable manner from the way they left things at the end of the previoud volume. They also inserted some tedious elements. Why is it that successful authors think it's o.k. to use their characters to lecture their captive readers on the authors' philosophy? We got long, unnecessary, and out of character discussions on comparitive economic systems, male-female relations, and even video gaming. Give me a break and stick to the story."
3,Decent book,It is a decent to good read. Some parts are better than other. However the style is not really David Weber it is more John Ringo. I have also read a lot of Ringo's books. I get the feeling that John Ringo did most of the book. Read some of the Posleen War series and you will see what I mean. I am not saying this is a bad book but it has become formulaic compared to the first two. In fact this book and March to the stars with some editing could be combined and make a much better book. Not really a fan of the ending either. It is like they are trying to draw this out into a series rather than tying up some story lines. Roger has almost become a caricature at times of the man he became. The way the book ended means there will be another. I just hope that they rethink the direction they are taking Roger quit dragging out the series just to publish another book. If you have new ideas for this world great but the term jumping the shark comes to mind and I think that is a danger here.
4,Very Entertaining,"The plot is very easy to follow since the first pages helps readers catch up on the previous events in the series.However, the ending was very abrupt, unless there are other books after this."
3,Limping to the finish,"A very average book with a very average conclusion. The end of the Prince Roger series runs out of gas with Roger's attempt to retake the throne. An overly long setup drags into the plotting of ex-soldiers on Earth. An obligatory space battle wherein the usurper escapes, and a deus ex regis showing Roger every nook and cranny of an impregnable fortress do not provide a satisfactory finale to a series with great promise."
2,Satisfying Installment,"While I found this to be a very satisfying conclusion to the three books that went before it, I would like the authors to continue with the series taking up where Roger is confirmed on the Throne of Man. I was left wanting more of the Throne of Man's struggles with the Caravazan Empire, the rebel military forces and expecially the play of the reluctant rulers of the Throne, Roger and Nimashet."
5,We Few Wins,"A satisfying completion (maybe!) of the Prince Roger saga. Ties just about all of the loose ends up, setting the stage for an Emperor Roger series if desired. Great space and ground combat action. Attention to detail on organizational and tactical matters. Very satisfying read---emotionally stirring (for this old sailor) ratification of ""Duty Honor Empire"" for both the Basik's and the Emporer's own."
3,Ringo Good - Weber Not,"You can certainly tell where Ringo stops and Weber begins. Fast paced action then excruciating, mind numbing useless detail of a boring Harrington want-a-be space battle. Almost like Weber cut and pasted from other novels to meet his contractual obligations. A real shame as it detracted significantly from the fast pace of Ringo's style."
5,A good resource book for Episcopal altar guild trainees,"Although dated in its perspective, this little book is a gem of information. It has a great deal of information packed into it. The reverent and practical aspects of altar guild membership are addressed. It gives suggestions for guild by-laws, prayers, and a very nice glossary. I wish it had more diagrams, including altar linen care, but for the price it's a bargain."
5,Choice songs fit for any age,The writing is soulful and the mix of music and poetry racks your mind. DJ Sae 1's master mix is phat.. and Erin's singing style is sultry and smooth.
5,"A very fine, beautifully composed trip-hop masterpiece","Lush vocals, edgy unpredictable sounds, this album outshines virtually every trip hop album released in the last few years. The vocalist is wonderful, the arrangements sublime: the overall sound created by Leomoon will carry you away..."
4,Tiger Blues Band-review-Big City Blues-Mark A. Cole-Dec 2001,"Long Island Bluesman Mike Manne and his band Tiger blues Band is hot locally.Manne pushes his Fender and Gibson guitars,and carries the vocal load.Michael Manne shows his Blues axe adeptness,and the band is guilty of aiding and abeting him.Put the new Tiger blues Band platter on and sit back and relax for some New Yorker Blues.Deciding to do a batch of well chosen standards and covers,Manne and company do their best to set any place aflame."
4,Galaxy SIII Cover/Case,"I like the case, color is good. The hole cut outs line up perfectly. The button indentations for the volume and power are a little too firm for my liking. I ended up cutting out the button indentation on the cover for the power and now it is EXCELLENT! I left the buttons on the volume side as is because I found I accidentally hit those anyway and the design of this case actually prevented that. I can still adjust the volume when needed. And now, with the power button portion cut away, it is an excellent little case."
3,navajo textiles:the william randolph hearst collection,"very nice book, especialy for good photograph with yarn detailes.i can get very interest information of the golden history."
5,The best bib we've ever used,We have tried a lot of different bibs from cloth to vinyl to rubber (like the Baby Bjorn bib - our daughter wouldn't even let us put that one on). This is by far the best bib we have ever used. We buy them for all our friends as maternity gifts. It combines the comfort of a cloth bib with the practicality of a rubber bib with catch pocket. You can easily wipe food off the vinyl front or just un-snap it and throw it in the wash. Even after two years of folding and unfolding the plastic still hasn't cracked. The only reason we had to buy more for ourselves is because our puppy thought it was a great chew-toy. Any other bib is just a second-rate substitute.
4,Best mess management option on the market,"I have tried many bibs and this is the best option I found. It catches all, liquid or solid ..., well. I like this smaller one than the big one even for toddlers. The pocket for this small one stays open better than the big ones. When we are outside, we can also put small snacks like cereals in the pocket for the infant. The only down sides I would mention is the outside harder to clean and the corner of the pocket will break but only after many use which I would say already got my money worth on the product."
4,Good for headache relief!,"As a chronic neck pain sufferer I bought the still point inducer in hopes of finding something that would release the tension in my neck and help restore its natural posture. Although the inducer didn't help in that area, I was immediately impressed by its ability to reduce headaches and for an overall relaxing experience. One kind of strange thing about the inducer - if you lay on it for a long period of time (>30 min) you will experience scalp numbing. Overall I would recommend this product as an alternative for headache relief."
2,SLIPPERY!,"I really wanted this to work for me. Unfortunately, the material is just too slippery. My head slides off no matter what surface (floor, bed,) that I try to use it on. Too bad, and back to using tennis balls that have been taped together. It may work for you, but it did not work for me."
2,just ok,I think this item is too soft to really have a beneficial effect. Two tennis balls in a tube sock work better...
1,Don't bother,This item was a total waste of money. You can't get it on the right spot and your head just rolls around.
2,What's the use?,"Very uncomfortable. Wish I hadn't spent the money. It certainly does not do what it is advertised to do, for me, anyway."
1,Two tennis balls in a sock,"My PT recommended the tennis balls in a sock after I went through weeks of PT for neck arthritis, and still had bunched muscles and headaches. Same concept, much cheaper, and less squishy, according to the other reviews here.The spot under the skull at the top of the neck is a great place to reduce muscle tension, though, if you are suffering. Give this gizmo or the tb's a try. Good luck."
1,"""soft"" means flat!","This thing is hollow and flattens out like a pancake! I assume the ""firm"" one is solid? Otherwise this is worthless!"
4,looking for a firm still point inducer,"This is a good product. It really helps relieve stress. However, I am looking for the firm version of the product. My masseuse has a firm version and it is amazing."
4,Still Point Inducer--Really works,Our PT told us to order this to relief headaches. And it really really works. I sit with the base of my skull leaning on it and I can feel the pressure release!
2,"Too small, ineffective","I was so excited to get this item. The idea is to simulate still point, but it's far too small for an adult head and it slips when placed properly. I'm very disapointed. I am an LMT, one of my areas of focus is Craniosacral, I would not reccomend this product."
5,headaches take note,"I was suffering from a rare occurance of a headache and remembered my recent purchase of the still point inducer. I used it for 4 minutes and had wonderful relief! It looks inocuous, but headaches don't stand a chance!"
3,Still Point Neck Relaxer,"Tried this product and found that it helps on occasion, however, it is uncomfortable to use for a long period of time."
2,Didn't work for me,"I know there are some folks who love this product. I'm pretty sensitive and found it uncomfortable to lie on. Others felt it was too soft, but I found it to be too hard. I'm better off with two soft tennis balls in a thick sock. They're easier to position, and I can adjust the pressure by varying the thickness of the sock I put them in. Just my two cents."
1,Synergy,"The reviewer previous to me mentions nothing of this dvd. Here's what you should know, Never, and I mean NEVER buy anything fron ""Synergy"" videos. They're brutal in their tranfers and that's why the price is low. Be forwarned."
2,"Good movie, very poor Quality","Good Movie, bad bad quality sound & picture. if you don't mind that you'll enjoy it! it was a good flick."
5,Make your own professional beauty products....Naturally!,"I have been so inspired after reading this book to make my own cosmetic products! Infact, I have already made quite a few products for family and friends (after owning the book for not more than a couple of weeks) and they all love them. There are so many different recipies covering a broad range of therapuetic beauty products, from milk baths and nourishing face creams, to foot lotions and body scrubs! Plus there is also the flexibility to alter the recipes to suit your own preference, for examlple choosing the carrier material for a paticular skin type when making facial exfoliaters. It is nothing less than rewarding to make your own beauty product which are as good quality ( if not better ), and less costly than professional products on the market. And the only negative comment I can say about this book is because I live in Australia it's very difficult to get some of the cosmetic ingredients in small quantities (but I'm working on it )."
3,---,"I almost ordered this book thinking it was a companion book to ""Natural Bodycare: Creating Aromatherapy Cosmetics for Health & Beauty"" by Julia Meadows. It is not. It is just the paperback version of that book.Beautiful book, well written, but doesn't supply all the pertinent information."
5,Great filter,"Installed this on my PT Cruiser and noticed about an 8% increase in fuel economy and also a little bit more ""kick"". Why keep throwing away paper filters!"
1,this filter is low quality,"If you use a filter on a quality lens .Buy a quality filter.This one is not,"
3,tainted by poor production,Groden would have done well to have a professional narrator do the commentary. It would have been more powerful that way. I'll leave it at that. Sometimes it's just a hoot!..Also the music sounded a bit on the homemade side too and also made me laugh at one point. But....lots of great photos and films. 21 films...who knew?....
2,Disappointment on video quality but NOT the Content!!,I have disappointed because of bad quality of DVD. It's Mastered from a used VHS casette. You can see even head distortion on bottom of the screen. Beause of bad quality it didn't made any difference than other videos. I have a download from internet that shows JFK Centered and it's crystal clear picture. I can manage it frame by frame. Other cameras are showing the incident incomplete. I think some one cencored the film rolls. Why they sell DVD in VHS quality. Let them sell cheaper CD version instead.
2,Tedious,"Bland! I purchased this in hopes to gain a more in depth understanding of what happened that fateful day in American history. The films all show without a doubt that the shot came from the ""grassy knoll"", but fail to provide any more interesting information than that. The voice over is lifeless and useless. Save your money on this one. However, any idiot that still believes the government had nothing to do with the assasination should be made to endure this one."
3,Nostalgic,"Contains some interesting footage from various people who were there that day in Dealey Plaza filming the motorcade. Fun to watch if you're a JFK conspiracy buff, or just interested in getting a more complete perspective (film-wise) from those people who filmed the event. The bonus feature, ""The Last Two Days"" is enjoyable, and gives you a nostalgic feeling for a time long ago past...."
2,Another Film to see,"Now here is a film that I had the pleasure of attending a private screening for in LA that will blow your mind!! It is a film which is based on new evidence (which was discovered) in the JFK assassination; this evidence was discovered shortly after the film was complete.It is an amazing film, very well written and directed.I have ordered my copy and anyone who is interested in JFK and the theories behind his assassination should order this film.http://www.amazon.ca/Frame-Mind-Carl-T-Evans/dp/B001M45O90"
2,jb2448,"Classic case if you want it to be there, it is!These guys see things that are only blurred blowups.Under there theory all of humanity is to blame.Such BS!"
5,An important documentation of treachery,"What is the nature of men who justify treachery when their power is threatened? Have they learned that people living in fear are easily controlled and willing to tolerate erosion of their human rights? Dr. Stanciu Stroia suffered hellish mental and physical torture rather than compromising his principles. . . . ""My Second University"" is an important documentation of treachery in our time and deserves wide distribution in libraries, universities and government archives. As crimes against humanity are subject to more exposure, we shall learn about human behavior and find means to improve it. . . . Thank you."
1,It's an elephant without feet,"The product image on the website is old according to the customer rep in BrandsOnSale. The delivery doesn't come with the feet, and the manufacture doesn't provide the feet, and BrandsOnSale doesn't take return because of this. So use your judgement before you buy it."
2,Good camera - except for red eye,"Happy with the features, functions, and performance of the camera in all except one area. The red eye reduction function is useless. I'm aware of the physical reasons behind red eye, and undertand it can never be completely eliminated. But most of the photos I've taken of friends and family are absolutely terrible when it comes to red eye. I had a compact Pentax zoom 35mm before this, and the red eye reduction with that camera was outstanding. Cannot undertand how many outstanding reviews I read about this camera with any mention of it's weakness in this area. If you ever plan on photographing someone's face, look for another camera."
4,Excelent camera but with few issues,"I have this camera for couple of weeks now and have taken more than 100 pictures. It is an excellent camera, though I have not taken prints yet, but I have seen pictures on TV & computer. Takes excelent movie. Whatever people are saying in the praise are 100% correct. So Why 4 stars??? There are few issues that I have encountered so far, which may not be of any importance to you, but are to me:1. It does not imprint Date on the picture. You can get the date printed on the prints, but that is possible through Canon's ZoomBrowser EX program. which means you need to buy a photo printer also.2. When viewing picture, you can zoom into the picture, but can not take a snapshot of any region. You can do this using any software, but that is an extra headache.I have seen Sony's DSC-P9, and it does both and is also an excellent camera."
5,Excellent camera,"Aloha thereBought this camera before Xmas here in the UK and have found that the camera is working perfect. This is my first digital camemra and I like it. I especially like the video recording that it can do. It's quite good. I have not yet learned all the fuctions of the camera, but so far it's been very good.I have researched for 3 month on digital camera's before I decided it should be this camera... I also bought a 256 mb CF card from crucial.com.It works perfectly. The only thing I have for this camera is the battery time. Another reason why i bought it was becuase you can dive with it and that is so cool. Imagine Thailand...Anyway, I can recomend it."
1,photo,I never recieved the camera that I purchase. There no explanation why the seller send me the camera.
5,This is a great CD.,The songs on this CD are well written and professionally done. She is a great artist and all of the CD's are great.
5,Selena: dreaming of you,"Whether it's the upbeat Latino rhythm or the awesome vocals by Selena, this CD is a definite winner. Through the thirteen tracks you will be swept away to a little bit of Mexico by the truly unique mix of Spanish and English. Starting with the Spanish classic, ""Amor Prohibido"", with the light tempo and the tale of a modern day Romeo and Juliet that is beautiful and heart wrenching. Or the sad sweet romantic tale in English about a young girls first true love, whose story is almost parallel to that of Selena's love life. Although Selena knew very little Spanish, after her first press conference for the CD into the Anglo market, which she achieved with ""Dreaming of you"". Which is still the only primarily Spanish album to debut as number one on the Billboard Pop Charts. Although Selena was killed by an ex-employee in 1995 she will always be remembered for her incredible vocals and unwavering dreams for this CD."
2,Great Music- Very Poor Sound Quality,"Selena deserves better than the poor sound on the recording. It's over processed, grainy, and edgy sound; absolutely awful. It sounds like a very bad mp3. It's almost unlistenable on a high resolution system."
5,Great availability,My daughter is taking Spanish and was introduced to Selena via a movie of her life and tragic death and loved her music. The CD was not available locally so I checked Amazon. My daughter was thrilled to receive it for Christmas and also that the lyrics were included in both Spanish and English. I think it will help her to learn and retain the Spanish lanquage better and longer.
5,The World is missing a great musical talent in Selena,"I've seen the movie ""Selena"" a million times and the music never fails to capture my imagination. The world lost a great musical talent who could have done even more to bring nations and cultures together. She was definetly the next ""Gloria Estefan"".... Selena, we all miss you."
5,Everyone is still Dreaming of you Selena!,"I saw the movie and absolutly LOVED it. Then my mom told me it was a true story. Next thing I knew my best friend got ""Dreaming of You"". Well now I know every word to the song ""Dreaming of You"". It is a beautiful song. I wish I had know about her before she died."
2,R.I.P,Selena Had A Alright Voice but Her Energy on Stage is Where Her True Talent was.The Music Here was trying too Hard To Cross-Over.I COuld Fall In Love was a Good Song.She Was Working With Full-Force on A Bigger Cross-Over but She Never Got the Chance To Really Shine.But She Left Her Mark.
2,HI,"SELENA IS A REALLY GOOD SINGER,BUT HER CD IS MOSTLY SPANISH. I LOVE 2 OF THE SONGS, THATS Y I GAVE HER 2 STARS."
5,Beautiful music,Selena captures any moment possible. Anywhere from Romantic to Exciting. One of my favorite artists even until this day.
5,This is more than a 5 Star Cd!,"Yes we all know Selena had enormous natural Talent but never forget she was a wonderful human being. I met Selena in 1991 when I was 10 years old. She was such a nice person she was kind and listened to my Mom as she told her how much we liked her music. She raised money for schools and for the communities in need and urged kids to stay out of drugs as she became a spokes person for ""D.A.R.E."" SELENA DIDN'T DESERVE TO DIE!Espacially at such a young age (23)She had movies and crossover albums ahead of her, the world was going to see and enjoy every part of Selena the Latino Community had been enjoying. She was happily married she was never out there beeing A slut or a hoe( Like other latina artists out there) Selena gave Latinos a good reputaion and she will never be replaced or forgotten."
2,Selena,"I just Love Selena, shes the best singer! it's just so sad she passed away in March 31,1995 we all wish she could still keep singing, but she is in our hearts for those who love her. And her music was just so beautiful I love all her cd's. So Buy her Cd's Now!!!!"
2,Poor show,"Vanguard Visionaries is an extraordinarily disappointing series, given that the label is being so stingy with its offerings. The label has an excellent roster. If they wanted to publicise their archives, they could have been a great deal more generous at this price - or else offered it for $6 or so. It's also disappointing that Vanguard is ignoring some of the wonderful stuff in its archives and focusing instead on meaningless releases of this variety - the ""greatest hits"" by the same artists, on the same label, are a much better deal."
1,Factory Rejects? Counterfeits?,"The packaging and the cartridges themselves look just like the ones from the local drugstore, but don't be fooled. A new, genuine Gillette blade glides smoothly and cleanly over my face, while these blades feel as if I'm scraping my face with a metal rasp. (Fortunately, I had a genuine cartridge available so I could make an honest comparison.)I don't know whether this is a counterfeit product, or factory reject Gillette blades, but take my advice: don't buy it!"
3,Gillette MACH3 Turbo - Not that gr8,I feels its is not the same Quality that you get in a shop. The blades do not seem to be as good as a orginal one.
1,Absolute Crap,"I have been using Gillette razors for some ten years now. I started with the Sensor and when that went the way of the dodo, I moved to the Sensor Excel. Those worked fine. Excel blades are now going up in price and at times are hard to find. Time to move on.After hearing rave reviews of this razor and people I know that like it, I decided to pick it up. It pulls at whiskers. It misses spots. I have grown accustomed to the missed spots and will go over them several times only to find out, after I have cleaned up, that the blade still did not catch those spots. My skin is quite sensitive. These blades are not.To add insult to injury, the blades cost a pretty penny more than their predecessors and they dull much quicker(straight out of the box).Don't buy this."
2,look cheap,I just got my shoes now. I haven't worn them yet so can't talk about that but these shoes came with visible dark orange or yellow glue on them holding the strap design on the side in place. I bought them for work with possibility of wearing them at other times but the way they look I'm not ever gonna be able to wear them anywhere else. I don't even want to wear them to work. I still don't know if I'll send them back.
4,"Great humor, only it isn't funny","I finished Miczak's 'Inside Justice' in a couple of hours. It's a short read, but full of humor. I do have to recommend this book. The author gives a lot of tips about the law that most of the general public aren't aware of. He speaks generally for New Jersey, but it's pretty much true to form every where. I hope to read more from Miczak in the future."
1,There are better books for Dental School Admission,This may be a great book for applying to medical school however there are many better books on the market for succeeding in applying to dental school. One particular book that I found very useful was the Ultimate Guide to Dental School Admissions. It was very through in explaining the application procedure and dental school admission requirements in applying to dental schools as well as useful information about dental school interviews and how to write a dental school application essay. You can find the book at http://www.predentalinfo.com
3,"OK, but...","I love Iceland. Been to Reykjavik just twice -- once on an Icelandair ""add a night"" deal coming back from London, and once on an Icelandair Valentine's Weekend package, during Reykjavik's worst blizzard in 15 years, or so the locals told us.The book is OK; as others have said, the Reykjavik info is pretty slim. Between this and the Insight Guide (great pictures), you'll be just fine -- but, man, I wish Rough Guide had a Reykjavik book."
2,A bit sterile...,"Being a Lonely Planet devotee, I was actually quite disappointed with this book. No more than the most rudimentary information, even about Rejkyavik, was presented. This made actually deciding what to see in Iceland particularly difficult - everything was listed, but there where no subjective judgements as to what was the most worthwhile use of a traveller's time and budget. And budget is a very important thing to consider when travelling to Iceland, as it is eye-poppingly expensive.There are some interesting anecdotes, and the pictures are lovely, but real guidance was lacking."
4,"Good, but there are better Travel Survival Kits","Just returning from a two week trip from Iceland everything is still fresh. This book is good. Compared to other guides on Iceland (I don't know about Greenland or the Faroe) this is the book. The content is essentially complete and correct. Lots of usefull tips and good-to-know's inhabit the pages.But, ... IMHO all this is just the high standard of all Lonely Planet publications. Compared to Travel Survival Guides I have used before, this one seems to be less clear, sometimes almost chaotic. The order of the chapters is a mystery to me. Also sometimes we had difficulties finding places mentioned in the text on the maps.Overall however, when you're going to Iceland: buy this book."
5,Good Comprehensive book!,"This book covers not only the basic's but the ""insiders"" view and tips. Lonely Planet has a way of detailing that most other books don't."
4,Not that bad......,"I thought this was a good little anime. I enjoyed it a lot. It does have some drag along the way on the story, but they are just small little drags (Like some conversation). The animation is simple but it does look good. I would say that it is a good addition to any fan of anime, that likes the sci fi genre. The story is good, not perfect, but good. (There is a small little love story in it, so cute) Once again, it's not that bad, it's pretty good."
4,"It lacks the menus and features all DVD's have, but the Anime is still so classically awesome!","I gave Green Legend Ran, a four star because it was not composed properly, there are no menus, no special features, no scene selections, and no Americanized soundtrack to Green Legend Ran. I, of course, enjoyed watching twice to three times a month or so, but the facts remain that it was ill-composed for what DVD discs have in common, the interactive menu's and such!I am obsessed with the English vocal version of ""Tears and Rain""!In my day, Soundtracks were complete and their tracks came straight in order of the movies progression. DVD movies now, have menus, special features, directors cut's, scene selection menu's, etc.!I am rating this DVD a 4 star because I enjoyed the animation, the character design, and the story. But I left a star because of the lack of interactive features all the DVD movies have!"
4,good enough to get,"not bad I think, I bought this because it's long...about 140min I think... so it's cheap $$/min ... story has some drags, but overall its nice to add to your collection. It's not a bad title...it's ok. But get Lodoss War first...that is really cool!! I just wish they release Miyazaki's stuff on DVD too!!!!!"
5,What is going on here,"I read one review of this movie that was good out of 5 I dont understand this, ever scince I saw this on the SciFi channel I loved it. Now that I have a DVD player, I can watch it uncut and subtitled! This has great animation, a great story, etc etc (I could go on) Watch this movie!!"
3,What anime isn't cool?,"After seeing this I wasn't surprised that I liked it, most all anime is awesome, good storyline { its about the same as most anime} but still cool."
4,Memories revisited,"Two greats bands performing well known favourites. The Snader telescriptions contain a wealth of music - some of it has already appeared in various edition e.g. the Storyville label. The Ellington band includes most of the well known personnel with Willie Smith replacing Johnny Hodges and Louie Bellson replacing Sonny Greer. Performance is generally great, but one would have expected a few more smiles from the participants. Particlulary Willie Smith is very sombre. The Hampton band performs with more enthusiasm and as expected Hampton himself is showcasing his various abilities on vibes, drums and piano. Good fun!!!"
2,Not as good as the others,"I actually found this book kind of hard, and difficult. I really hated how it started and ended. I really loved all the other ones but in a sense, if you read the other ones you sort of have to know what happends but it will kill you to get there. I really did not enjoy it. :|"
2,By far this band's weakest effort,"Great White never put out a bad album--except for this one. I bought this in 1994 when it came out. I had enjoyed the very underrated Psycho City from a couple of years earlier and expected more of the same. Well, I was completely thrown for a loop by the fact that it was an entire album full of ballads. What always made Great White ballads--especially the legendary ""Save Your Love""--stand out was that they were surrounded by quality rockers. The lack of energy and hooks on this album was very disappointing. I sold the album back after a few listens. This experience almost kept me gun shy from buying the 1999 effort ""You Can't Get There From Here"" by these guys. Fortunately a friend lent it to me and I found out that it was a much improved effort. I have six Great White albums--but this one is certainly not one of them. The only album I have heard by this great band that I would not recommend."
1,erreur...à vérifier,"J'ai acheté le cd à $23.99, qu'elle ne ft pas ma surprise, il n'y a pas le cd Live in Anaheim pourtant il est mentionné à l'endos du cd.J'en conclus que c'est une fausse publicité.Très Très decevant...donc je lui donne 1 étoile"
3,Great White - 'Sail Away' (Zoo Entertainment),"Notice that on 'Sail Away',the band is trying to recapture their formula that put them near the top of their heap in the '80's.A major downfall for them is it didn't fly.However,both long time and new fans JUST might like what they hear on this disc.Vocalist Jack Russell is in fine form as the rest of the guys are too,as for their playing.As for the tunes,there are some good ones,like ""All Right"",the bluesy ""Mothers Eyes"",""Gone With The Wind"" and ""Livin' In The USA"".If you're looking for an outstanding lp like their 'Once Bitten' or 'Hooked',you won't find it here."
1,Self centered and outdated,"One could rewrite the book on half the pages- just take out the outdated references, the self-centered self-apraisals of the author plus the party-dialogues. Then- after you reduced the webpages listings to those that still exist and took out some of the too basic checklists- you might have a tool worthwhile spending $ 15 for. I was somewhat surprised that such reputable publisher would put its name behind such a book."
2,Not bad if you are at the VERY begining....,"There are some good ideas for those at the infant level of an internet presence. If you have already started, don't bother with this one. The format is very much like a school book which make navigation easy. No need to read from front to back."
5,I wouldn't have missed it for the world.,"There is a freshness about this work-in-two-media. With the rendering (and rending) of the artist's soul there is also, thank goodness, the reassurance of language-like a bridge over it's troubled waters. As a word person myself, I am particularly facinated by the picture part of the work, but also by the interplay between the two.The essential candor of the visions demands from the artist an equal openness in the text, so that the two potentiate each other, so to speak, like the gin and vermouth which become something else in a successful martini. It is powerful stuff.And then, too, William Blake, a master in two media, comes to mind. The probing and the sharing of the inner workings of a human being are about as intimate as one can get, aren't they? And yet, the artist's own determination to give an honest portrayal allow the work to transcend the wrenching experience of it's raw, very raw materials.I wouldn't have missed it for the world."
5,A riveting read with drawings to match,"Drawing It Out is an intimate and inspirational account of the author's one-time experience with the drug LSD under controlled conditions, and how that experience led to dramatic, life-changing events portrayed in the book, not only in words but in 61 of the author's powerful drawings.Her story is riveting and offers an unprecedented graphic look at how a contemporary woman's personal transformation unfolded over a period of 20 years. The author reveals the hidden processes of the unconscious mind as she navigated her way through painful relationships, emotional pain, loss and death.Not only for those interested in the therapeutic value of psychedelics, but for everyone interested in personal transformation through the power of art and the human spirit."
5,The Cramps,"This was actually the first Cramps cd I ever got and now that I own the rest of their cds this one has always remained my favorite. If you are new to The Cramps this would be a great album to start with. They are hard to label - part punk, rockabilly, psychobilly, surf, and just plain rock n roll all thrown together. Lead singer Lux Interior died in 2009 and the band called it quits after a career lasting more than 30 years. This album originally was released in 1986 and contains some of my all-time favorite Cramps songs. ""The Hot Pearl Snatch"", ""What's Inside A Girl?"", and ""Can Your Pussy Do The Dog?"" are my top three songs on here, but this album is really solid from start to finish."
5,"If you don't dig this album, you can kizmiaz....","Hands down, the best and most solid Cramps release EVER! Breaking away slightly from the straight up rockabilly sound to incorporate some surf tones only enhances this already great cd. We also find Lux not as dark and sinister; instead acting up in a fun and playful way with songs like Chicken, Cornfed Dames and Can Your P*ssy Do The Dog? . These songs show the direction the band would pretty much follow for the next several albums. Other highlights however are the songs Kizmiaz (Lux and Ivy's swooning duet) and What's Inside A Girl? (which shows Lux's admiration for serial killer Ed Gein). In all honesty though, there's not one dull track on this album! If you don't already have this one, why the hell not?!"
2,Okay Garment Bag,"Much bigger than I expected and the nylon feels a little cheap. Although, for the price it does the job!"
4,decent garment bag,"This is a decent garment bag for the price. It's not a heavy weight bag, but I only needed to protect (and hide from my fiance) my wedding dress on a flight to Mexico. The bag protected my dress coming and going and is still in very good condition.My only complaint is that the bag is a little short for a full length wedding dress with train. I had to push the train of my dress into the bag. Not a problem though, as I had it steamed when I arrived at the resort.Definitely worth the money!"
5,Good Quality,Very happy with this garment bag. I used it to carry my wedding dress overseas and the bag was easy to fold and very easy to carry. The nylon is a bit thinner than I expected but it didn't cost much and the quality of the bag is very good.
3,good sized bag,"This garment bag is not made of the best quality material. It seems like it may rip easily if used a lot. I am only storing my wedding dress in it, so it works well."
4,Perfect for my wedding dress,"I got married abroad and didn't want to have to lug the huge garment bag my dress came in. I had trouble finding one long enough, but not incredibly wide at the bottom. This bag was perfect and fit both my dress (which was full, but not huge) and my husband suit!"
5,Exactly what I was looking for,"I have to carry my work clothes in the car along with me to change in to after my daily workout. I wear pants a lot, so I wanted a bag that's long enough to let me protect pants without having to fold (and wrinkle) them. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this bag considering its reasonable price. Additionally, there's a zippered pouch at the bottom that's big enough to hold shoes and other loose items. I've drug this bag through snow, and it's withstood my dogs tromping around on it in the car. It was exactly what I needed."
2,"Not for music, really.","Ehhh, It's just not worth 80 dollars, if you made me tell you how much I would have paid for it, maybe 45-60. Maybe. There is a constant hissing in the background, and music is worse. When you hear the cymbals of your favorite rock band, it hisses worse still. And of course the overall sound quality is not worth 80 dollars. I have been forced to use other headphones just because of how awful these things are. I would just get a regular Blue tooth headset, or REAL headphones, or ear buds. These just are not ready for music yet... Other than that, you can tell these are of high quality, they are good headphones, just not for music. Maybe phone calls... The mic works VERY well. It is a cool feeling to walk about while talking on skype.Wirelessly."
2,Poorly designed headband,"The good electronics in this headphone are ruined by the cheap, poorly designed headband. I purchased this product because I wanted bluetooth wireless headphones, with noise cancellation, in a folding design to replace my Sennheiser wired headphones. The bluetooth in these headphones works perfectly - easily and reliably pairing with my Sony iPod transmitter. The headphones charge easily from a mini-USB connector and the battery retains its charge for a good length of time. However, as noted in other reviews, all of the products good features and negated by the headband, which is cheaply fabricated and poorly designed. After only two uses, the headband refuses to stay open and is therefore extremely annoying and uncomfortable. The bottom-line: STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT."
4,good but forget the noise canceling...,love the sound and convinience. Range could be better. Good battery life. Noise reduction adds more noise then it eliminates. Have tried two sets and both have the same issue with poor/no/negative noise reduction. Use them w/o the noise reduction and you will love them too. Only other problem is they don't automatically connect (like my other bluetooth devices do).
2,Arrived unusable,"Apart from having a general appearance of less quality than its price might suggest, This item arrived without the proper dongle for charging. In place of the dongle which would allow charging from either AC or USB it contained a dongle of a different type."
2,Wonderful for a little while .....,"I bought two pairs of these, so that we could listen to the TV whilst working out ...... they have now both broken, a week from each other, and I cannot get them to work any longer. I have tried everything to fix them, but to no avail. When they worked, they were fabulous, but I have now found them extremely expensive to only work for a couple of months. Very disappointed :("
4,Bluetooth headsets,There will always be a problem when the warranty doesn't last a year. The product never does either. But while they worked they were good. Everything was good about the headsets except durability.
2,Try something else,"I usually don't find myself writing reviews. However, I feel the need to save people some of the drama with these headphones. The issue I have is not a defect.... it's just how the product was made. I have bought 2 pairs of these and both easily lose reception with the phone it is paired to. I keep the phone in my pocket and still manage to lose the connection. I've gone back to using the uncomfortable Best Buy store brand bluetooth stereo headset... they keep a better connection and last waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay longer. As for the ""noise-cancelling"" the only cancellation comes from the fact that the headphones do a good job of covering your ear. Save your 8 hr battery life by turning off the noise cancelling... it's not doing anything."
1,Don't Spend the $,"If all it were trying to do was to be a bluetooth headset it would be okay and the sound would be okay. But it tries to be a microphone as well, and the sound quality is abominable. Add to that the fact that the microphone picks up EVERYTHING WITHIN TEN FEET and you have a useless product."
4,"for the price, they work!!!","first, for this product, all went well. had them in less than a week. secondly, they do what they were designed to do. wasn't looking for the perfect audio experience, just wanted to ditch the wires at a reasonable price. this product was it. works well with the sony bluetooth adapter. easy to pair and operate. money well spent."
3,i913 noise cancelling headphones,"i bought these and they turned out to be the wrong item; not the merchants fault, mine since i thought these would have a transmitter to attach to my stereo. the company took them back, and i ordered the i903s which are what i wanted, and they work great. well made and well engineered. good sound. reccommended"
5,Excellent Informal Reading Assessment,"I am part of a special resource room team servicing several schools in Region 3, Queens. All 12 of us use the Silvaroli as our choice assessment tool, measuring decoding and comp. skills for our annual reviews. The assessment works best when you know the child or have worked with him/her and know if this is a usual performance or not."
2,Not too impressed,"I got this book because of the good review here, but i must say that i was not impressed by this book at all. The details are too sketchy even for a review book. Some of the stastistics are diffrent from standards such as the ECA and NCS studies.It has great potential as book to use as framework and using another book like kaplock/saddock to confirm facts or expand info."
3,Great content but poor functionality with kindle for my pc app,"purchased this for quick brush ups when interacting with ever curious psychiatry residents.found it's paper relative (2003) to be extremely helpful during my own prior residency training.while the content of this e-version (that i've been able to read) is excellent and very easy to read, i have been unable to get this book to stop crashing my kindle for pc app on my windows 7 (64 bit) computer.amazon customer service was top notch (as always) and refunded my purchase. they also provided step by step directions to resolve the issue; however, the book remains buggy.hoping they provide a technical fix so i can enjoy this book on my computer in the future.once the bugs are fixed, i expect to re-purchase and upgrade the review to 4 or 5 stars."
3,Decent but not fantastic,"I used this to help with re-certification. I used the first edition for my original boards. This version is OK. It is certainly thorough enough to assist with prep but it is extremely text driven (i.e. lots of narrative paragraphs). Would be better for me with more diagrams, tables, or outlines. The questions are relatively weak in my opinion so this text would need supplemented with another question bank, etc. Overall, I am still glad I bought it, but will likely rely more heavily on the material I received from a board review course."
3,Cramped out,"I'm convinced that the Cramps are undead -- they really don't age, and they claw themselves out of the grave every couple of years to release another weird album. This album is pretty much the same as their previous few -- very good in places, but uneven. About half the songs are good, but the other half sound tired and wasted. The Cramps were a little better when they sang more monster songs and strange covers and less deviant sex songs, but nevertheless they can still be witty and entertaining. ""It Thing Hard On"", ""Like a Bad Girl Should"", and ""Wet Nightmare"" are funny enough tunes to justify buying this record if you're a Cramps fan and want to keep your collection complete. However, if you're just getting into it you might want to buy some of their earlier stuff before trying this."
4,Scratch & Sniff Music At Its Finest!,Russ Meyer meets Dick Dale! Makes me want to round up cattle in a Cadilac
2,"Great band, mediocre offering","The Cramps are one of the greatest bands of all time, but this manages to be a below-par offering from the godfathers of Psychobilly. There is nothing new offered on this album, and all the songs sound like rejects from the debut. In end, this is a fun listen the first time, but it isn't as memorable or affecting as the group's earlier works. You probably won't take it out of it's case more than once. However, it is 97% better than anything else on Epitaph."
2,Boring and repetitive,"This book barely held my attention. The stilted dialog would leave me wondering what the point was, it certainly didn't build character. And the suspense wasn't very strong. I really started caring less whether the ""mystery"", if you could even call it that, would be resolved. I think readers would be better advised to look elsewhere."
4,I have to admit this is my favorite workout,Its a bit easier than I need but I just double up the routine and it seems to work fine. Out of all the tapes I own I like this one best!
1,"Tape will not rewind, have to run it backwards, takes forever","It came promptly and it plays fine, but it will not rewind, just sits there. Have to put it into play mode, reverse and it takes a very long time to get back to the beginning of the tape."
2,I thought Simmons was supposed to be good for the klutzy!,I found this tape very difficult to follow. Simmons gives little or no instruction and no warning about what's coming up next. Poor photographic direction makes it difficult to see how the exercises are performed.
4,Mother inlaw,I look all over for this for my mother inlaw. She love Richard and was happy that I found it at a great price.
1,workout?,"I thought Richard Simmons would offer a good energetic workout. I would recomend this product to the elderly or people with physical conditions, I on the other hand got more of a workout walking to the mailbox to get this tape. I stood in front of the tv for about 15 min's waiting for them to start the actual workout I then started fast forwarding looking for the workout. I never found it. I then took the tape out and put another one in. If you are looking for a good workout I would recommend you look elsewhere. Sorry Richard."
3,Richard and his Dance Club,"This DVD is different .It has a stage and a band and at the end of each song, Richard prances up to the stage like a teenager to applaud the mediocre band.choreographed and without Richard's usual directions on the exercises, it would be very difficult for one to follow up, especially someone too obese to be as agile as this dance video displays."
3,Good for Seniors,This is perfect for those of us who don't move quite as easily as we once did and even for those who do. It is fun and easy and you do indeed work up a sweat.
2,great-grandma,"I have 5 RS tapes and I liked this one the least. It was his first and he has improved each subsequent ""Sweatin'"" tape. Yes, you have to struggle the first few times to get the steps but I expect that. I would have preferred the workout was longer, which is why I prefer Sweatin' 3 & 4."
2,Good... but a little disappointed!,"I don't consider myself in the greatest of shape... to be quite honest, I'm quite overweight. I haven't been in the habit of exercising regularly, so I thought a little bit of good ol' Richard would do the trickWe (my college roomie and I) started with Sweatin' to the Oldies 3 and LOVED it! We do that one all the time! After finding the first STTO tape somewhere, we decided to give it a try. While it was fun, we really didn't feel like we got much of a workout. The songs are shorter and the moves more repetitive... I'm hoping the STTO 2 tape is better. :-/"
1,Sweatin' to the Oldies,The tape is blurry; appears to be copied too many times. I paid for a new edition.
2,Eh,"This is not a good tape for younger people or those who have some background exercising and being fit. You just don't get a work out if you are. However, if you're bigger and do have a full range of motion then this is a good starting point."
1,disappointing,"It is hard to hear the commands, counting etc. over the loud music. He does not seem to have a pattern to the movements...one might be four counts another 12....one cannot hear in order to follow. I was very disappointed."
5,Swinging with the oldies,The music was great and makes you WANT to dance with it. Enjoying the flashback to the oldies as well as dancing with it.
4,I lost 135 pounds....,"I began with slow walks around the block everyday. At first only 10 minutes, but working up to 30-60 minute walks. Then one day I put in an Oldies tape and started dancing.These tapes appeal to me since I always have enjoyed dancing and wished I was better at it. Well, when I dance alone I can PRETEND I'm the best dancer eve. ;) Good music and cheerful banter helped motivate me. As I lost weight and need to kick up the routine I added weights, speeded it up, picked up videos to alternate with......It's been 2 years now and I still enjoy a week or two of Richard's videos when teh weather is rainy or when I just feel like giving my mood a push up.I really enjoy seeing real live people working out in these videos. Female, male......Obese to average, muscular to flabby......It makes me feel good to be working out with other normal appearing persons."
5,TERRIFIC!,"I am amazed that some reviews and some of my friends complain, whine, they can't follow, boo hoo. I go one way he goes another. After playing the tapes a few times you pick it up. Just go with the flow. Have fun! I lost 30 lbs already. Am 70 yrs old and was able to get off my high blood pressure pills. People crack me up. You don't have to do every step. Laugh, have fun. I am indebted to Richard Simmons. I always hated to exercise and I get up 6:00 every morning and play at least 2 tapes! Thank you Richard. Kathryn Sommers-Meek, San Diego"
3,"Good tape, but not my favorite of Richard's","Richard's tapes are a lot of fun to do once you learn them, and this is no exception. However, I prefer a longer routine. (This is only 21 or so minutes aerobic.) And Richard doesn't do mirror cueing on this tape. But it's a good place to start for Beginners. Beginners be aware that there are a lot of knee lifts that will wear you out the first few times you do this routine. The up side to this is that you will build strength and stamina quickly and be able to move on to his other aerobic tapes that are longer and just as much fun (if not moreso). I'd say this tape would be too easy for Intermediate or higher exercisers."
1,Poor translation (too formal for a kid),"I'm always on the hunt for Spanish-language and/or bilingual books for my Spanish-dominant child. I was so disappointed to receive this. The translation from English to Spanish is very ""formal"" which means long and complicated Spanish words are stand-ins for the simple, kid-friendly English words. Not fit for a toddler but maybe a child closer to ten years old?"
2,a little predictable,"Heller's novel gave our language a new term, but the popularity of it should be tempered by its overriding flaw--it's contrived. But go ahead and read this book for entertainment, though I don't believe you will learn much or perceive insights into war, institutional behavior, etc."
5,Great resource book,"This book is an excellent resource book. It is like a cookbook for gardeners. It's a how to, where to plant book for beginners and experienced gardeners. Plants don't shy away from me now at the nursery. I'm not hearing ""please don't pick me"" anymore. My yard is begining to be plant heaven instead of plant cemetery."
1,Southern living,I was very upset because I didn't order it. It was to hard to return. Although I would have liked it otherwise.
4,The Southern Living Garden Book,"Arrived sooner than expected. Brand new. Great discount. Doesn't answer my every question, however, meets my expectations.Smooth process. Satisfied customer."
5,The Great Garden Book,"A friend of mine let me borrow her 1998 edition of this book, as a transplant southerner I need all the help I can get. I found every plant I have in my yard, most have been given to me by friends. I didn't know some of the names or anything about the plants except the little info that was shared along with the plants. This book is wonderful and well worth the cost, I would recommend this book to anyone living in the south! The pictures are lovely and the information is great. It covers everything, the other sections about compost, planting, ect have also been of great assistance. If you buy this book or give it as a gift everyone will really enjoy it!"
5,I couldn't be without it!,"I bought this newer edition to replace the older, much used, much loved edition published in 1998. I couldn't be without this book! I go to it constantly for information on culture, cold hardiness, etc. I like that it includes information on Tropical South, Coastal South, Lower South and Upper South zones. I can sit for hours just reading the plant encyclopedia! I'm sure this edition will be as well-worn as the previous one. A very useful book for the southern gardener!"
5,Great book!,My wife is an avid gardner and I am always on the lookout for a book such as this. It is very comprehensive and full of good information. She loves it!
2,A difficult read,"Unless you are both a music student/professor and a diehard Jethro Tull fan, I fear that like me you will discover this book is likely to be very hard going. Allan Moore is both and that style permeates the whole analysis of this 1971 breakthrough album by Tull.The interesting thing about the 33 1/3 series is how variable and eclectic the variety of writers are. The thing that hits one most about this specific book is that unless you really know the album inside out and Tull's greater musical history, you are hampered from the outset and the greater part of the book proves pretty unfathomable. Every song gets dissected with a musical surgery analysis that drains any desire to go and listen to the album further and the numerous footnotes to other books, articles and websites (including a fair number by the author) leaves you wondering if you have ended up in some heavy version of a music pseuds corner.One of the least enjoyable of the series I have read so far!"
5,Unforgotten is an awesome compilation of AP's best music!,"This is the best thing Agnes Poetry has given us yet! Their early work included amazing, heart-felt songs like Walking in The Rain and Leaving, which were previously only available on their early CDs, Unrest and Forgotten, which were great music, but with poor sound quality. This double CD set brings back all of those old favorites, but with a much improved, ""remastered"" sound. The songs are not remixed, so you can hear your original favorites, but the sound is much cleaner, so you don't have to adjust your controls with every new tune, and it is much easier to hear and understand the lyrics. The sound quality of Unforgotten parallels or maybe even surpasses that of Leave the Light On. A MUST for any Agnes Poetry fan or fan of techno/synthpop music. I couldn't be more thrilled that Agnes Poetry is heading to California, where I can hear them more often!"
5,Whoa,"Yes this is worthy of all 5 stars. This compilation is truely a treasure. Every song, in my opinion, is a masterpiece. If you own the original albums already you should still consider buying this because the sound quality has been greatly improved from the original versions. Like the other reviews say, if you're a synth-pop fan this is a must have. If you're new to Agnes Poetry this is the perfect place to start. 29 glorious tracks!Favorite songs disc 1: Catch Me If You Can, Until(mystical), My Reward(oh yeah), The Dreamer(magical), Walking In The Rain("" ""), Pseudo Joy, Leaving(classic).Favorite songs disc 2: I'll Be Your Oracle, Inspirational(whoa), The Last Time, I Hear, Painted Melodies(the Leaving of disc 2), Harmony(whoa again), November(my favorite instrumental), Drown(slowed down taste of what's on Leave The Light On).Thank you. Buy this it's well worth it."
5,Something Different,"I bought this album somewhat blindly based on Internet recommendations. I was hoping for some new quality synthpop music, and that's what I got. Although I can't say I like every song, the good ones (and there are quite a few of them) are very good.I'm impressed by the subtlety, depth, and strong melodies of their songs. At times they seem pretty heavily influenced by groups such as Depeche Mode and Erasure, but they also clearly have their own unique sound. One thing that especially impresses me in some songs is their vocal harmonies.Again, I find some of these tracks better than others, but there are so many and such a large number of good ones that I consider Unforgotten definitely worth owning."
5,Wonderful!,"This is a great addition to any collection. I was so happy to see that Agnes Poetry had put together a cd with all of their greatest songs. If you haven't heard of Agnes Poetry before, download the free mp3's that are offered, then decide about the album.Some of the older songs are really great and heartfelt, although the newer music is great as well. In the newer songs you can really hear the band developing their style and talents and making even better music than before. That is saying a lot as their first works are already wonderful!This is truly a band who deserved to be ""discovered""! They have broken up, but Rannoch and Randon are making music under the name of Adom9. So, get this album while you can!"
5,The Bible for Maths Teaching,"This book is an excellent aid for all maths teachers and students alike. It is full of explainations and investigations that are possible to use in a class setting. Teaching Mathematics is also great for recreational maths, posses interesting problems with clear explainations. If your a Maths teachers, buy this book."
1,JUNK,"Don't waste your money. This is the type of book that brings in money by capitalizing on the latest craze but offers no current insightful information. Better to check out websites such business2, wired, redherring, etc."
2,not as good as The Small Business Guide to the Internet,The Small Business Guide to the Internet: A Practical Guide to Going Online is the only book I've read that gives the prospective online business person an actual list of attributes a business should possess if it is to be successful online.
3,Just the Basics!,I expected more from such a well known professor from Berkeley. The book has the basic information on its first part and some (101) borrowing practical examples of something already done by some people.
2,"Boring, Repetitive, Non-productive","I read this book for an undergrad philosophy course, and found it pretty worthless. The individual submissions tend towards repetition, with an over-emphasis on defining terrorism, and not much justification for the strategies they propose to combat it. Generally, however, the essays just don't cover much ground, and the discussion helps no one but professional philosophers. Any one with a practical interest in combating terrorism, be they military, political, or in any other field, would find the book unhelpful.The Chomsky and Sterba submissions are interesting, but others, such as Philips', are just plain weird. Philips' solution to long-term terrorism is to give in to the demands of fundamentalists, and take our society backwards to meet theirs. It would be a scary thought if he could actually argue for it well. Teachers, please don't assign this in class, because in addition to the above mentioned problems, its also very boring."
4,Terrorism & International Justice,"This book investigates the root of terrorism and the reasoning behind it, while exploring how the civilized world can deal with it within just and moral boundaries.The authors of the various chapters attempt to illuminate differing views about the reasoning behind such acts. However in most cases, the invesitgation is quickly halted and satisfied in putting the burden on the Western world. In like manner, and in a fairly passive approach, the book downplays the significance of the religious roots that has been at the core of so many wars over the past 1400 years.It is difficult to find common justice to deal with the terrorism problem on a global scale when the motivating force that initiates the problem is to the contrary of that justice."
5,excellent book for young listeners,"This beautifully illustrated book is a simple story of a girl's imaginary journey in her toy boat. The small amount of text on each page not only keeps kids interested, but encourages them to ""Read"" the story themsleves. My very active two year old will ""read"" this book aloud over and over. And better yet, she can't stop talking about boats and lighthouses. I highly reccommend this book."
1,"A good laugh, this book is a joke","This isn't a science book, its a religious book disguised as science. Anyone with some knowledge in a subject can present their distorted views in a positive light and prove that 1+1 doesn't equal 2. I've seen plenty of works like this. The only people who fall for it are those who are ignorant in the first place. If you have some knowledge of the subject you can quickly see through the malarkey.Evolution does NOT have to be at odds with religion. Just accept the fact that god created the universe and all its physical laws. Earth is also his creation and it formed based on how he created the universe. Evolution from simple to complex scares some. Just accept it. God is a lot smarter than we are. We cant deny his laws because we are afraid of them or don't understand them.Ignorance is not bliss. Learn."
4,Great as a gag,Great as a gag gift. Although my friend I bought it for said her cigerettes got stale after sitting in the donkey for a while... I will still make her use it everytime I see her!
1,Not a bowl,"Attention marijuana smokers! This item is for storing and smoking cigarettes. It is not a bowl, but it should be."
5,Thermacare Heat Wraps,These heat wraps are excellent for reducing pain from sore muscles and can be worn for 8-12 hours of warm relief. I totally agree with the previous reviewer that they are better than advertised!
4,"Slow to warm, but great once it does","It seems to take about 10 mins or so for the thing to really warm up, but it really stays warm once it does.Great for sore muscles and also cramps. Like the fact that it's portable and doesn't take a great deal of space.Only problem was really getting it to stay where I wanted without holding it in place. Overall, highly recommend for the occassional stiff neck and shoulders."
1,Didn't work,"Perhaps there is a reason these are on sale for half off? Three separate packs were used out of my box -- each became only slightly heated. After applying the first wrap, I couldn't tell if it was working or not; that's how un-warm it was. That's why I opened another. This one felt warmer, but it never became hot, or even warm enough to cause any relief to the sore, crampy muscles. I would not purchase this product again, and in fact, tossed the unused portion of my box in the trash."
5,Mom of 2 in Rochester,"This is another of our family's favorites. It's filled with fun songs with intelligent lyrics covering topics from the solar system to divorce to veggies, and of course, libraries! (My father liked the veggie song so much we had to get him his own copy!) This album will take you many, many miles."
5,Afterwords,"This is a beautiful book, inside and out, very powerful and moving. The contents are both specific and universal, packed with wisdom and wit. These spare, delicate, charming poems deliver a mighty wallop, and illustrate, once again, how our deepest experiences can be transformed into art, rather than confession. You will not regret this purchase."
5,"Sophisticated, deep, beautiful music.","OK, I admit, I adore Play. One of my favourite albums ever. But if you have never heard PLay: The B-Sides, you are missing out. ""Sunday"" is a wonderful song, with great, lighter sounding dance drums, great piano sample, and superb synthesizers. ""Whispering Wind"" is a dip into Moby's dark side, but not like he did in Animal Rights or ""Machete"" (on Play). Spirit has the BEST drums ever for any genre of music; it is a must hear. Has drum'n'bass, ambient, hip hop, dance... A must have for anyone who loves Moby."
4,"Not the 1969 original, but still solid","This version was recorded in 2004 to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the original hit. If you read the text of the newspaper in the artwork it will tell you the reason they thought it was necessary to re-release ""Something In The Air"" as a single. Since it has been so long since I heard the original I can't really make a decent comparison, but this version sounds fine."
3,Good introduction to player skills and roles,"This book is a good introduction to the roles of the players and the skills they have to learn. It would be suitable for someone new to playing rugby and wanting an overview, or a spectator wanting to learn more about what they are watching. There probably isn't enough detail in the descriptions for players wanting to improve their technique.The book is loaded full of colour photographs of rugby players in action, mostly from New Zealand domestic matches and international matches. One thing I would have liked is more diagrams supporting the text (even in exchange for some of the photos). There are hardly diagrams at all.The text is well-written and easy to understand."
2,"pretty book, but...","lots of nice colour pictures, but a little basic for all but the absolute beginner."
5,Stupendous,This is deffinately the best book you could purchase in the name of Rugby. It is deffinately worth it and then some. I have atleast 45 books on Rugby and this is deffinately the best book.
4,world war II hits hard,"The second book in the third volume of Powell's monumental series (Book 2 of Autumn).This is the first time that World War II hits hard at the main characters, with family members falling to the bombings of London.Similar to the first book of Autumn, direct conflict is limited to hiding behind black out curtains during air raids."
1,No Japanese Language!,"I love this movie, but it is a simply atrocious to release a Japanese movie on DVD without including the original Japanese language dialogue as an optional audio track."
1,I hate this thing.,35-80mm.... horrible distance. not worth getting ever. get a 50mm. colors are horrible. not sharp. plastic lens. Just dont get it. you'll never thank yourself for purchasing it.
3,not what I expected,this lens is very slow. it captures the light very well and is great when taking pictures of adults but not ideal for kids.
4,Cheap but pretty good,"You just have to understand this lens for what it is and what its limitations are. It's not an L, no IS, no USM. It's an old lens technology; my lens was a remnant of the old EOS 10s film camera but it's an EF mount so it fits my new t2i.It's best for still photography or portraits with good lighting; not for sports. My photos of the orange tulip shows surprising results.What was pleasant was the lack of CA or purple fringing. Canon has CA that needs to be corrected post but this lens doesn't need it.Do a search about a macro hack for this lens. Then you might change your mind about this cheap but capable lens."
2,Product incomplete,The lens was fine but what upset me was the missing caps. I recieved the lens with no cap for either end. I was disappointed since this was not stated in the descripiton. It seems to be a standard peice of the lens espically when shipping.
1,Overpriced with too little content.,"The word ""workbook"" in this context means that the majority of the pages are blank and you're supposed to come up with your own ideas. The approach that is outlined recommends spending 22 weeks to focus on the areas of workload, control, reward, community, fairness and values.This workbook is good for setting up a long series of meetings so a group can claim to have addressed the issue without having to actually make changes to their organization or environment. If you'd rather address a problem than pay it lip service, this book is not for you.Death March by Edward Yourdon gives a much better overview of the issues around burnout, but is primarily focused on a software development environment. The Dilbert Principle by Scott Adams is far more insightful about organizational problems leading to burnout than this workbook and has the benefit of being entertaining."
1,Does NOT work with induction,"The seller claims that this will work with ""all ceramic, electric, and gas cooktops."" Not true. It will not hold a magnet and does NOT work with induction. I hate wasting my time on returning items due to false advertising."
4,"BOC rockin' it live, but the producers dropped the ball!","Blue Oyster Cult shines on every track here, from cover tunes to originals. This could've been THE live party album from the boys. Unfortunately the production work made it sound very 2 dimensional. Watching and hearing these guys work live is an experience, and their performance was flawless. ""Buck's Boogie"" is always a lot of fun, especially down near the front where you can see these guys work! ""Last Days of May"" is done with all of the mystery it always has, and ""ME 262"" is the best (only?) WWII rock ever. A must have for any BOC fan."
4,MY FIRST EXPERIENCE OF THE BLUE OYSTER CULT,"I spent a time in high school trying to figure out who was who in this band, which made the listening even more satisfying. This is B.O.C. at their best, live. Albert Bouchard(co-founder, drummer, vocalist, songwriter, multi-intrumentalist for B.O.C.) said that this was his favorite of all their albums. HARVESTER OF EYES and THE LAST DAYS OF MAY stand out as anthems of the ages."
5,The best BOC album,"This is a really, really good album.Critically panned when it was first released, On Your Feet stands out today as a vastly underappreciated classic, and by far the most consistently excellent recording by a band whose three-decade career produced gems of astonishing brilliance (""Don't Fear the Reaper"") as well as heaping piles of excrement (any song co-written with John Shirley).As with every succesful BOC effort, the element that stands out here is Buck Dharma's incomparably musical guitar playing. The entire album consists of extended jams showcasing Dharma's virtuousity and utter mastery of the riff.On Your Feet captures BOC very close to their creative and commercial peak, when every album improved on its predecessor and the band's potential must have seemed limitless."
4,Dinosaurs and a New Earth,"I love these crazy plots. Dinosaurs are appearing and disappearing in central London. How and Why? The Doctor is called upon to answer these questions. And of course to save all of mankind. After all, anyone can solve a simple little problem like dinosaurs in modern London, but if all mankind needs saving it takes the Doctor :)A fun read, the Doctor has Sarah as his companion in this one and the fine folks at UNIT to provide an assist. As with all these novilizations I have read so far there is lots of action, but not a lot of explanation of the thoughts in people's minds that drive these actions. Also as with all these I have read so far it is a quick fun read, a couple hours of enjoyment.The end could be taken as a bit preachy, but you can just take it at face value and you have a satisfactory conclusion to a fun story."
5,Exactly Right!,"This rackmount rail system was exactly what I needed to mount the UPS. In my opinion it should have been included with the UPS but that's another story.This rail system is rock solid. Easy to mount, sturdy and stable."
4,Unique among creationist tomes.,"Doctor Shedstrom's polemic can be disregarded. Whenever someone uses invective of that nature without giving credit to the thought, depth, or breadth of a book...then we may safely chuck his view for being off the rhetorical map. Young earth creationism is alive and well and Shedstrom's ilk should take anger management classes so they can discuss the pros and cons of creationism without hyperventilating. Is Kelly's book without flaw and inspired by the Lord himself? No...but it is still a damn good work."
2,Infuriating,"I have not read too many books by Christina Dodd, but the ones I had read prior to Rules of Surrender were wonderful. This book simply made me angry. Our hero has been off with the bedoins in the Sahara for 13 years or so and has adopted their annoying male chauvinism. I found nothing lovable about Wynter and could not figure out what their love or attraction was supposed to be based on. What are we supposed to see in him? Charlotte does not seem to like him and yet decides she's in love with him. He was overbearing and seemed to browbeat her into submission. He had awful opinions about women and their subservient roles and second class emotions. To top it all off, the love scenes were all coerced and read like rape fantasies . . . definitely off putting.I did not enjoy this book. I spent the whole time reading it expecting her to slap him and yell at him, which never happened."
2,Save your Money,`Rules of Surrender' was just boring. I enjoy Christina Dobb current series check those out and leave this one alone! I would suggest instead The Lost Princess Series by Christina Dodd or The Royal Brotherhood Series by Sabrina Jeffries and skipped this series.
1,AWFUL!!!,"This was probably one of the worst books I have ever read...The one reviewer that said that this did not involve rape is seriously deluding themself. Just because someone doesn't fight, no means no. Perhaps I am being a little overzealous, but when a woman gets hauled off to a tent and has her clothes ripped off by a domineering barbarian, I don't care - that is gross. I found myself actually pitying the heroine for being so weak. I only finished this book so that I could give it a proper review. It wouldn't be fair to not finish it and then rip it to shreds. I will never read another novel by this author and she has nearly turned me off of the whole historical romance genre forever. Horrible book!"
3,"Cute, but not one of her bests....","I was so looking forward to getting my hands on and reading this book. And when i did i was delighted by the context and the characters. The novel started out well, i fell in love with charlotte from the first page, and equally with the children. Wynter was a diffrent matter. I really liked him at the begining, but gradualy started to dislike him. The reason i gave this book a 3 star is because of the ending. I was very disapointed with it. It was cheesy and unbelievable. If it had been written better i would have really enjoyed this book. It's a cute story, but the ending is too predictable and corney, but up till then it've very entertaining."
3,A somewhat disappointed reader,"This book was a very good read. However, it did disappoint me. The hero acted too much like a confused little boy too often to be appealing, he also could have used a little more attitude.The conclusion to the extortion problem was unexciting. But I did enjoy the end of the book."
2,Disappointing,I was really excited to read this book but once I started it I was soo disappointed...Charlotte may be a Miss Priss but Wynter is such an arrogant jerk. He belives that he is the bases for her whole existence and that without him or any man she is nothing--that really bothered me and I never cared what happened to the characters because of that---
1,DULL... How in the world did this book get a 4 star oveall??!,"One of the most boring romance novel I've read this year, maybe in 2 years. I like this authors more recent novels, which are filled with wit, humor, passion and engrossing plot.This book, *sigh* Take my word for it, skip it!....Heroine is boring, cold... book is filled with words like discipline, dignity, equanimity, manners, whats proper whats not, dragged on and on..... just boring as hell. Who wants to read about a dull, up tight governess who has zerop sense of humor? Add a hero who says the dumbest things that are just roll-your-eyes silly, you get a romance book thats very hard to finish reading. Not to mention these two seems to have zero chemistry.THIS book was a waste of time."
3,Romance Reader Junkie,"This is a good read, but not an ""I can't put it down"" or ""laugh out loud"" or ""swipe those tears"" read. Ms. Dodd is a very good creator of interesting characters, but they didn't have very much depth in this work. And, honestly, I don't expect incredible depth in romance paperbacks, but I do want a character to hook me. Wynter almost did. He was very close, but his chosen wife just didn't develop enough to carry off his quirky, romantic ""King & I"" part. I will continue to read Ms. Dodd's works because she is a very readable author."
5,Another great book from Christina Dodd!,"I had previously read The Runaway Princess by Christina Dodd, and was impressed. I hit my local used bookstore and bought That Scandalous Evening and Rules of Surrender together, not suspecting they were connected. What a pleasant surprise to have the Jane/Ransom/Adorna story continued! I read Rules of Surrender in two days, and enjoyed it. However, it wasn't as good as some historicals I've read, in that Charlotte seemed somewhat muddled in the last half of the book, like she didn't know what to do with herself. I probably would have hit Wynter by that point.Anyways, if you read this book, I would also recommend reading The Runaway Princess. It is the story of Danior and Evangeline, the Sereminian royals. Also a great story!!!"
5,Loved It!,"Just finished the book. I agree with some of the other reviewers that the hero is pompous, but it is all a part of the desert culture that he spent his formative years in. After all, don't most men think women couldn't live without them. The victorian era was very repressive, and the author shows that at heart Charlotte is just as wild as the hero. I hope the author completes the series and marries off the remaining ladies. The story that was set up at the end of the book is very intriguing. Would make a fantastic read."
1,Dodd or Dudd?,"I was surprised this book turned out to be a dud. Christina Dodd stories are usually entertaining, full of wit with lots of romantic tension. This story lacked all of the above. The hero had no personality. I pictured him as Tarzan, especially on how he spoke and thought. He did not believe a man could love a woman based on his early teachings with the desert nomads, so you can imagine the anguish the heroine had throughout most of the book since she loved him. She should have been named Jane. Now, all that was missing was Cheetah the chimp, though I do not think his humorous antics could have saved the novel."
3,Not as good as Rules of Engagement,"I picked this book up because Rules of Engagement was great. I was a little disappointed. After putting some history to rest, there is no reason to continue the struggle in this story to keep the two characters apart. Charlotte has found herself a wonderfully perfect man, and yet she remains unbelieveably unhappy because he hasn't uttered those 3 little words. I love to read funny bickering between the characters, but Dodd made Charlotte sound patheticly vapid in her false notion that words speak louder than actions. Dodd took a admirably strong and independent character and turned her into a shallow child by the end of the book. I'm still going to buy the 3rd in the series, though!"
3,I liked this book,I liked this book but it isn't one of my favorites. I was a little annoyed with the hero. Maybe it's just me. I have read the entire governess series and this is important to the story line.
1,Disgusting,"Romance is a guilty pleasure of mine. This book - literally - made me nauseous. Essentially rape in the guise of romance and marriage. I was willing to follow along until the ""hero"" forced himself on the heroin, her body's response making it somehow acceptable even though she said no and fought and cried after their marriage. I skimmed the rest of the book hoping there was some sort of redemption, but no."
1,Oh this was just awful!,"This book was really terrible. I didn't like the hero at all, and didn't like the heroine much better. The hero was ridiculous with his bone-headed ""adopted"" eastern cultural views and his daily habits. The governess just silly. The attraction between them made no sense at all. I can take some very creative plots and this could have been pulled off it the characters had somehow been made believable instead of just caricatures."
2,Not her best work,"I really enjoy Dodd's writing but found this particular novel unsatisfying. The storyline had so much promise, but I saw little character development and little growth. I kept waiting for something, such as the heroine to use her backbone, or for the hero to become enlightened but came away disappointed. Don't bother with this one unless you like your heroes to be chauvinistic. I read this after reading book 2, Rules of Engagement which I suggest getting from the library. I am not going to bother with the 3rd book. Life's too short to waste."
3,Not the Best,"I'm not going to go into the details of the story, I'm sure the other reviews have said it all. My reason for the 3 stars was the fact that I found the hero to be rather hard to like. As most stories go, he had the true ""alpha/macho man"" thing going on. But it becomes frustrating to like a character that doesn't believe in showing affection for the opposite sex. I guess my whole thing is that I much prefer some of the other books in the Governess Brides series."
3,"I guess (1) 64MB Card is better then (2) 8MB cards, huh?",I purchased what I thought would be (2) 8MB Playstation2 Memory Cards but what I received was (1) 64MB Memory Card. I would assume that the 64MB card is better than the 8MB card but a little clarity should be given to the advertisement so people won't be expecting one thing and receive another.
4,We love Bunnies by the Bay!,"We absolutely love the Bunnies by the Bay buddy blankets. My daughter received one as a gift when she was 9 months old and developed an almost instant attachment to it. She's now just over 2 years old and can't go anywhere without it (to the point where we've bought 3 back-up bunnies so that we can rotate them in the washing machine etc.)They're so soft & adorable, plus they're not too big so they're easy to tote around. We couldn't live without them!!"
2,Underwhelmed,"Even though I'm sure that measurement details were given, I was disappointed at the size of the little blanket. I would not have paid $24 for it had I seen it ahead of time. Also, inside had the information that a portion of the sales would be given to support Chinese orphanages. My heart goes out to children in these circumstances anywhere, but we do have many here in the U.S.A. Inasmuch as I purchase regularly from Amazon and have not been unhappy with any item before this, I will not complain."
3,Love it but expensive to keep replacing!,"My son loves his Frog buddy blanket and I have to admit that it is really cute and adorable. But there's one problem - it is not cheap! We have two (one in the crib, one in the wash kind of thing) and they both look so worn already. He loves to chew on them and they are so ratty and no matter how much you wash them they still don't smell fresh! I would love to just buy him two new ones and get rid of the old ones but at $24 each that's not going to happen. I wish that I had bought him a cheap lovey in the beginning as most of my friends did and they just replace them every few months at a fraction of the cost. If they halved the price I would give this 5 stars and keep buying them!"
2,Nothing like my original Bunnies by the Bay Blanket,"I received a Bunnies by the Bay blanket in pink for my daughter when she was a newborn and at around 5 1/2 months of age she became very attached to it. I decided to buy a spare so that I could rotate them during bedtime and she would have two that smelled and looked the same in case one was lost. I received this one from Amazon and it is nothing like my original. It feels like a cheap knockoff. The velour and satin are thin and synthetic feeling, the bunny is not stuffed as full and the ""fur"" is not as soft. And... the pink color that was inside the bunny ears washed off after being put through the machine once!!I recommend that if you didn't buy your first Bunnies by the Bay from Amazon, you don't buy your replacement here."
4,Different than our other Emmit,"We have a 2010 Emmit who is our daughter's favorite buddy, so we bought another one, and they are slightly different in three or four ways. I don't think she knows yet, but eventually we'll have to get another newer version so they are the same and she won't know. They are very soft and cute, but the biggest problem is that the synthetic fabric STINKS after one round of her sucking on it. It's not her breath- she's only 9 months and still has baby breath- it's the fabric mixed with her saliva that causes the smell. Other things she sucks on don't smell, so it has to be that synthetic fabric. But, my daughter is in love, and Emmit is very soft and cuddly, not too small that he gets lost in the crib, and not too big that he takes up too much space in my diaper bag."
4,Blanket,A good companion for my daughter. She attached to the bigger version as her blankie so now we have the buddy to go with it.
3,Stick with it,Be patient with this novel. In the begining you are inundated with new charecters and sublots every few pages. It reminds me of watching news coverage during some kind of widespread disaster. The network cycles through 10-15 different locations involving different perspectives and personalities in a very short time. You only glean enough information to realize that the situation is FUBAR; you can never fully relate to any one particular situation or its' human element. You don't empathize with the people in this novel for that reason. I found myself not wanting to invest any more time in this book; there isn't a single character you root for. I am glad I trudged through. The final third of the story is quite good. You've become familiar with the cast and Brunner moves seamlessly from one event to the next.
4,Death By Garbage,"Ok, I agree with the other reviewers who say this book is an important work that has a strong socioenvironmental message, but don't let that put you off! It is also a gruesome rollercoaster ride of violence and horror with some of the best quality kills presented in literature. The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse ride roughshod across America and the rest of the world! Buy this book and enjoy the ride with them! (Not for the squeamish, however-I guarantee that you will never use your microwave again!)I would have given it five stars, but Brunner does get a bit preachy and full of himself in places. If he makes you feel guilty, just remember to recycle so you can sleep at night."
3,The world didn't end like this,"I read this in college, and it was profundly disturbing back then. It was easy to believe that an ecological catastrope that would destroy the world -- driven by the unintentional actions of millions and unstoppable even by the heroic actions of a few heroes. But twenty years after reading it, the world looks much, much better, and it is difficult to take this particluar apocalypse so seriously. Many of Brunner's visions in his other novels have weathered the 20 or 30 years since he wrote them quite well, but this one really hasn't. ""The Sheep Look Up"" was well written for its time, but is probably unreadable today."
5,Whose prediction do you believe?,"In the early seventies, science fiction writers wrote about buying bottled water, no-drink days on public water supplies, smog warnings in large cities, and drug resistant bacteria ravaging hospitals with what used to be innocent infections.Most of these 'radicals' were lampooned, and placed in the same categories as Star Trek, and Buck Rogers.John Brunner was one of these crackpots.He predicted a day where the consumption of organic foods became fashionable. He predicted a day where you might see traffic jams lasting hours which would shutdown large cities. He predicted days where medical waste would close the beaches of Southern California.All of these overly-sarcastic and ridiculous visions of the future have come true.This places us at the beginning of _The_Sheep_Look_Up_.This book should be a must read for everyone over the age of 14, to help us as a society understand the seemingly innocuous consequences of consumerism."
4,Brunner dates his novel about 75 years too early!,"Brunner tells of a future -- the 1970's -- filled with environmental horrors, the reemergence of obscure diseases, and a vast eco conspiracy. Change the date to 2050 or so and the Sheep world can be real. Interesting that the Cape Cod fisheries are about dead; ""dead"" diseases such as TB have re-emerged as antibiotic resistant! Not to mention newer viruses such as ebola, marburg, rift valley, HIV, etc. The book is still relevant. Although the US focus on the environment during the last 30 years or so has helped slow down its destruction, there aren't many other countries doing the same."
4,Predictive and Interesting with Minor Flaws,"I really enjoyed this book, and read it for the first time about 40 years after it was written. It was a little hard to get used to the style of it at first but I am glad I did. All of the different characters from all sides are understandable, relatable, and real. The story is real with some minor flaws. The only things I kept thinking about were the lack of inflation (everything seemed to cost the same as it did in the 70s) and a couple of other things with the technology. But overall I thought many of the things in the book had already happened a bit which made it scarier and more interesting. The measure of good sci fi I suppose. I recommend this book."
1,A good one to miss!,This seems to be my week for bad films; and this one was one of them. This is really a good one to miss.
4,Sounds good to me...,"I'm very pleased with this item. I wasn't expecting Bose equivalency at these prices, but what I got was miles ahead of some other more expensive items I've owned. Very good sound, with adequate, if not fabulous, bass. It's attractive as well -- I'm a sucker for electric blue lights -- and unlike some other systems, it's got a display you can actually see in the daytime. I've read a couple of reviews that said there was a hum out of this unit, but you couldn't prove it by me -- mine just sits there without any extracurricular activity that I'm aware of. And as far as damaging the unit by yanking the doors open manually when there are warnings all over the unit and the manual not to... well, ""Doctor, it hurts when I do this."""
3,"Decent,but...................","Outstanding sound for a small box.AC adapter is very bulky,especially for a small area.Time display must be manually hit when the unit is on. CD works well, but again must open door with a manual button. Room for improvement."
2,want printer problems?,"If you are looking for a printer that is quick and easy to use then DO NOT buy this printer. I have used many printer/copier/fax machines for years and have never had any problems using them, until now. This machine is so unreliable when it comes to switching functions on it. Sometimes it will work and other times it will take hours to work. They probably aren't all this way, well I hope anyway. But I am very hesitant about owning a BROTHER again. I would have given it just one star but the one thing I liked about this item is when it actually works the quality looks great."
3,Wow! Not Bad...,"Much better introduction to those of you who want some definitive Stabbing Westward. Nothing here for the long time fans, but artwork is nice..."
3,Strap Color,"The Lupahs are definitely unique watches - you really have to appreciate the style to like them. The rectangular shape could be misleading though, dimensions are a lot bigger in real life. Also the color of the strap on the Amazon listing is not a good image. It's a lot more bright orange once you get it out of the box. Search the listings for Lupah Lorica strap, and that will give you a better idea of how bright the strap is."
2,Not good,"My daughter wanted a man's watch for her birthday, so this Invicta watch was perfect because orange is one of her school's colors. Anyway, a knob fell off only one hour after she put it on to show off. We never could get it to work. I think the battery was dead. The box it came in showed age also. I sent it back and only received half my refund because I kept the backpack that came with it as a bonus."
2,Trash Removal,"OS 10.4 seeks to be all things to all men, thus it contains many MB of no possible use to most users. It needs to include a purging program to remove trash. Fonts in foreign languages, translations (how many people in the US want to convert classical Chinese to simplified Chinesw), printer drivers for printers that the user doesn't have consume a great deal of space. This book needs to be far more aggressive."
1,"This is ""Fluff"" or ""Gunk"" for your bookshelf","This book is sparse on substance. Most of it is is filler. I have net to find anything that is a useful. A subhead on page 17 sums it up ""It's Psychology, Not Just Technology!"". Almost no technology, in this case. I was looking for discussion of unnecesary speed sapping processes that sometimes get going on under OSX. The book doesn't even mention processes."
5,Beware listing error,"These are the best lures I've ever used, but beware on Amazon's listing, they have the photos mixed up for the Firetiger and Rainbow Trout patterns - I found out the hard way when I missed it and ordered the wrong ones by accident."
1,Sensational,"I feel this book is overall a sensational one and the writer seems to focus on the most negative aspects of the Columbine tragedy. It seems to be more of a recount of all the headlines the newspapers had. Spent way too much time debating the 13 verses 15 victims. The fact is 13 people did not have a choice about dying that day and 2 of them did. I personally know some of the victims families and the writer did not do very good research on some of her facts. There are a lot of people willing to talk about Columbine who just want there 15 minutes of fame. They did not know the people they talk about. I wish the book was not a ""religious one"" but rather a secular one. I have read the books on Cassie and Rachel and they were excellent. This book seems more to be sensational, negative, and tries to wrap up some sort of spiritual spin on it. Though I did not disagree with many of the things written I do feel that the writer overall just wanted to make a buck."
3,Not the most original goa,"Some might think this is awesome, but that's the reaction that most dance/trance fans experience when they first hear decent goa music. Compared to its competition, Sun Spot is not the most original of goa, the songs have slow horizontal progression and lack the intelligent and furious variations that you get from Infected Mushroom's B.P. Empire nor does Dark Soho possess the impact and force of Juno Reactor's Labyrinth. In a lot of ways this is a bit of a lazy album with songs overly long for the ideas they present - which arent all that many."
1,tic-tacs=bad stomach ache...period!!!,"I love tic tacs...I love that they are only 1 1/2 calories, and that they are just so minty!!! (or orangy, or cinnamony, depending on the flavor). However, if, like me, you eat all 72 packs of mints in the same day (HEY!!! THey are so addictive, you have no idea!!!), then you will gain many calories, have a horrible bitter taste in your mouth, and have a stomach ache that you in NO way can get to sleep on. Just say NO to tic-tacs."
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! -[...],"Why do I keep watching Vince Vaughn movies? Some people find his stuttering, fast-forward speech, and gravelly voice endearing, however it gets on my last nerve. Add to that a strange story and a talented, yet underperforming, cast to the mix, and it was a recipe for disaster. The story is really stupid and full of plot holes, no one wanted to go, but Vaughn gets roped into it and they all go? Everyone's getting divorced, than they dance and are in love, than they argue and are getting divorced, enough is enough! This movie sucked! It wasn't funny, it was weird and predictable, and stars Vince Vaughn...who should never play guitar hero in public again!"
5,really fun,watched it several times with friends and family. hope a sequal is made. good movie for couples/adults to watch. not recommended for children.
5,Couples Retreat loved it,I just finished watching Couples Retreat with Vinve Vaughn and I loved it. I laughed a lot during it and found it be very entertaining. Its a great sit back and relax feel good movie that is beautiful with its scenery and the cast was perfect.
4,Movie,Great movie. Very funny. DVD arrived without a problem and on time. I would recommend this comedy to anyone who wants to watch something funny.
2,Not funny,"With a few brief exceptions, this movie is just not funny. Silly concept with a lame, contrived execution and a cliche happy-ever-after ending. ""All star cast""? I think not. Yawn...Not recommended."
1,Hollywood out of ideas,"Vaughn, Anniston, Favreau, Stiller, Owen Wilson, Diaz, Sandler et al just keep making the same movie - for about the last ten years. If you have a number of movie channels and flick back and forth you can just watch one big whole steaming movie of over-acted Freudian-Jewish-liberal moxie"
2,Funny but not a gut buster,"I found this movie only mildly funny, It would have been really good but it wasnt, given its all star line up, location and story line. If your willing to invest in a half hearted chuckle movie.. Then this is for you. If your looking for a look back on it and say ""that was totally awesome"" then you better go look for something else."
2,OK,All the really funny moments used in promotional ads. I could have waited to see this one on HBO. Slow and lazy
3,"Screw the critics, it was fun","What do you expect going into this movie? It was entertaining, a little silly, with likeable characters and stunning scenery. If you like that description, you'll enjoy it. Note that there's some rather adult subject matter, though, so it's not for kids."
1,Not as pictured,"I personally love this movie. I picked this one because it says it comes with the digital copy. Yea, not so much. I'm werally pissed that it doesn't have the digital copy and will be returning tomorrow."
3,Laughs and guffaws,Good viewing for a Saturday night with your sweetie. Several laughs throughout the picture.There is a good message for your marriage in the end.
3,Could've Been Better,"Being a Vince Vaughn fan I was going to buy this movie without seeing it first. Boy am I glad I didn't! I thought this was going to be funnier than it was, and I was left disappointed. I thought Wedding Crashers and Four Christmases were hilarious but this one didn't even come close. I'm glad I saved my money!"
1,Ridiculous,The movie was bad enough - but being forced to deal with ridiculous iphone ads and BD-live nonsense etc before even being allowed to watch the movie is simply unacceptable.
3,"Silly, Silly. Silly","If you like silly, then this is your flick. I would not say it was all bad. I certainly did laugh out lout a few times. I do like Vince Vaughn even though if you watch one of his movies then you know his character, he is always the same. I noticed he wrote, produced and directed this movie. More power to him for choosing this visually stunning location to have his movie made. This film in blu ray does make you feel you are there."
2,This movie was really bad,The movie had a lot of potential to be a great comedy. But the entire time it seemed like the set up to a joke that never has a punchline. It's like you're all set to laugh but the laugh never comes. I chuckled a few times during the movie but mostly it was depressing. I also didn't like how all the wives in this movie have 6-pack abs but all the men were fat. And the one of the old fat guys goes to a party with young hot girls and they're all over him. You can tell this movie was made by men.
2,Pathetic Vince Vaugn vanity project,"I knew I was in trouble when the opening credits rolled and Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau were listed as the writers. This is another of those unfunny vanity projects that sound great at the pitch meeting but fall apart in the execution (See: Tropic Thunder). Everything was packed into this movie to ensure marketability except funny, well-paced jokes. And I liked Vince Vaughn in Wedding Crashers and Dodge Ball. Jason Bateman better watch that he doesn't sink his comeback by making these losers."
4,decent movie,"fairly funny movie. i rented this to watch on my Kindle Fire while on a plane trip. it kept my attention, didn't require much thought. very light, and i enjoyed it."
2,this movie couldnt make up its mind..,"I like romantic comedys, I like serious films, I dont like these two mixed, this movie takes you from what is suppose to be funny scenes to serious scenes with little transition between. I felt like i was on a bad-comedy emotional/serious relationship rollercoaster watching this movie. It had a few funny moments, but alot more dry moments.. I was expecting alot more."
2,Skip it - not funny,"This was a terrible movie... and it's not funny. I'm not sure why some reviewers ""laughed throughout"" unless there's some chemical enhancement ongoing. There weren't many jokes and few situations were funny. Maybe some find facial expressions hilarious and don't need much else. I don't categorize it as comedy or romance. I'm extremely disappointed in Couples Retreat, especially given the cast, and wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
2,Vince Vaughn Going Through the Motions,"No, this isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, and if I had never seen the previous Vince Vaughn flicks (Swingers, Wedding Crashers, Four Christmases, etc.), I might have been impressed with his witty banter with Jon Favreau, but given that I have seen Vaughn's earlier films, Couples Retreat had none of the required punchiness to carry the film. As other reviewers have mentioned, it was extremely predictable. Despite my past support of Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn, this movie has me thinking twice about bothering to watch any of Vaughn's future films, similar to the effect that Funny People had on me regarding Adam Sandler's work."
1,What a disappointment!!,"I loved Swingers and I love, generally, whatever Vince Vaughn. But this movie is horrible. Not even funny. Oh god, it was sooo bad."
2,Forgettable I think.,"I expected to like this despite the bad critics reviews. I liked ""The Break Up"" even though a lot of people didn't because they found it uncomfortable to watch Aniston and Vaughn fight, this was like that only not as funny (IMO of course). It started off ok but went nowhere. I guess this is what they mean by forgettable because I watched it a week ago and I can't remember what I disliked so much about it, just a waste of time I guess. If there was half stars I'd give it 2.5 because there were some funny parts... I'm rambling again."
1,"A major disappointment, what a shame","I was destined to see this film, in spite of all the bad reviews.. but If I can save ONE person the disappointment and total waste of one hour and forty minutes of their life, I will consider this review a success.I had been looking forward to seeing this film for a long time and I guess that lifted my expectations. The cast and previews also had me thinking I was in for a great ride.It was a struggle. There was only one scene that was remotely funny. The paper-thin story line is stretched out laboriously and the editing and production look at best amateurish.I love Vince, but I think its over."
2,poor choice for me,"amusing in spots, but not especially good. i watched it with my finger on the fast-forward button, anxious to have it over!!"
1,Not worth the time,"I love comedies, and I love ""dumb"" comedies. But this movie was horrible from the first minute until the credits. I found it depressing and outrageously unbelievable. I'm only sorry that I watched it all the way through rather than turning it off!"
5,Couples Review,Excellent cast of characters in this Tropical Love sick comedy. Vince Vaughan Jon Favreau are a completely insane in their relationships and how the other cast members deal with their shortcomings. Jean Reno as the counselor of Relationships with his support staff are hilarious.
2,Disappointing for a Vince Vaughn film...,"I'll just start off by saying this is the worst Vince Vaughn comedy I've seen. Not that I'm trying to put it all on him, because I think the writing and directing were probably the culprits, but I made an effort to see this film because he's one of my favorite comedy actors and has played some great roles. But this movie is more than forgettable, it just ain't funny! I thought the movie tried too hard to be visually funny rather than delivering funny lines per say and for me it just didn't work. Sure there were a couple of chuckles here and there, but basically the movie was very flat and sappy at times as well.Final Grade: C-"
2,"watch it if you don't have anything better to do, but it will be precious time lost!","You can glimpse the plot of the movie from the title, it is exactly what it says, only completely lame with over-the-hill actors getting richer while wasting our money! I wonder why some people think empty acting can be funny. What happened to smart jokes, even silly jokes that will leave you breathless? Having Vince Vaughn in this movie is a total insult to him; another example how having funny people in a stupid movie doesn't make it funnier!"
2,Boring and you've seen the funnies already,Unfortunately this is one of those movies where most of the funny parts you saw in the trailer. Vince Vaughn has a couple of good lines but the whole movie itself was rather boring and dull. I guess this was supposed to be romantic comedy but there have been much better ones as it doesn't quite go well in any direction. My advice? Just stay away. Much better movies to spend your time on.
1,Just Bad,"I love Vince Vaughn, but this was just awful! The plot of the movie was of no interest and I did not have one good laugh. I was actually rooting for the movie since Vaughn directed it, but I ended up being very disappointed!"
1,Don't Use Amazon Unbox,"The movie was great, that is, after we rented it from Blockbuster. It never finished downloading from Amazon, so we had to go out and rent it from someone else... and get this... NO REFUNDS even when it doesn't work! Better read that small print... I will not be ordering any more movies from this service."
1,Horrible!!!!!,"I try to think of myself as someone that can recognize a decent movie, and this movie sucked! Maybe...2 or 3 funny parts and that's it. Great cast, horrible writing...whatcha gonna do?"
3,So-so,"This film was mildly entertaining. I must admit that even with my long term fondness for Vaughn and Favreau, I still had a hard time enjoying this production. Reno was most entertaining as were several other supporting actors,especially Peter Serafinowicz who was brilliant."
3,Entertaining,We watched this movie in flight and it was pretty good. Kind of hoakie at the end though. Not necessarily kid appropriate because of language and behavior.
3,It was okay,"Overall, I enjoyed this movie. There were some boring points, when I could find myself drifting off into some other land, but what I liked the most about it was the fact that it still made me laugh without going overboard. It is possible! Sure, there were crude jokes, but they didn't show any extra body parts that really didn't need to be seen. They went as far as ""I hold some tension in my upper thighs"" and then stopped. It still made you laugh, but it didn't make you cover your eyes.I like Vince Vaughn and Jason Bateman, so I personally enjoyed this movie, but I recommend you rent it and don't take people's words on ""It's so great, you should buy it!"""
1,COUPLES RETREAT is nothing more than a SLEEPING PILL!,"Sadly, I bought this movie because I ASSUMED that Couple's Retreat would be FUNNY. Oh boy was that a bad assumption. Lesson learned $20 later! :( Just because VINCE VAUGHN was funny in Wedding Crashers doesn't mean COUPLES RETREAT is funny, too!If you walk away with anything from my review then I hope that you take this advice.....ALWAYS read other people's reviews before watching, or worse yet, buying a DVD because more often than not, other people's reviews are pretty much spot on!My advice: SAVE your money...COUPLES RETREAT is nothing more than a SLEEPING PILL!"
1,GMS,This was definitely not what I thought it would....I thought it would be a real comedy....it was a bit amusing but definitely not a comedy....this is one movie that I would not recommend as a comedy....the only way I could describe this is as an unusual drama....
4,Cute and funny,Cute and funny movie with great a actors. Loved the entire movie. A little far fetched but good to see at least once.
3,Good overall movie!,"I liked the movie but it just took too long for the plot, in my opinion to play it. Once it did, the movie was over. It was a good movie overall if your watching it with your wife but I would recommend some popcorn and soda to help stay awake."
2,Pretty much stanks,"No laughs, lousy script. Not even the visuals are very interesting. I really wanted to enjoy this because I like Vince Vaughan, but he has nothing to do. Neither does anyone else. Don't waste your time. A piece of current Hollywood product."
4,A Great Comedy for all couples on date night!!!,"My husband and I are huge fans of both Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau. When we heard these two actors where going to be in ""Couples Retreat"", we knew we were going to laugh the entire movie. As the movie starts, the viewer finds that each couple is having problems in their individual marriage. However, Jason Bateman's marriage is the one marriage that is heading toward divorce. Jason Bateman's character and his wife's character convice the other couple's to go away on a vacation with them to this retreat where they promise each couple that they will get to have all the fun while Bateman's character and his wife will undergo intense relationship counseling to save their marriage. Bateman and his wife's character are unable to afford the trip without the other couple's going because of the group vacation rate. When all the couples get to the island, the laughs start rollin. I hope you all enjoy!"
1,all couples should retreat,Such a stupid movie. There was only a small amount of humor...good humor. The story line was unrealistic. Who would go to a couples retreat for your friend's marriage and to save them money?? Just a bad movie that if cleaned up could be better...at least 1 star. It is not a family movie.
1,Couples Retreat,"This movie was extremely disappointing. Boring, predictable and unfunny. For a movie with incredibly beautiful women spending most of their screen time in bikinis to be boring - now that is difficult to accomplish, yet this movie managed to do it."
1,Hugely disappointing,"After enduring funny clips on the commercials, and being really in the mood for a good comedy, I went out and got Couple Retreat and was sorely disappointed. The funny clips seem to be the only funny parts of the movie, and the star cast does nothing to revive a weak story line."
1,Wow I was even surprised at how bad this is.,"This is so bad. The plot is sooo predictable it was laughable. My wife and I placed bets on what was going to happen. I won when the ""Gang"" split up to look for Trudy who obviously went to the other resort. My wife won when Shane's wife came back to him. We both won when everything works out for all. The product placement is over the top in this. Apple, Fruitloops, Guitar hero, Sandals resorts and many more were irritatingly obvious.I was glad to see Kristen Bell (From Hero's) But her talent is wasted in this lame script.If we didn't make a game out of this We would have turned it off 30 min in. Still wish I had."
4,"i was so ready to NOT like this, but i did!","OK, so it isn't the best film in the world... but, honestly, it was just silly fun.keep your expectations LOW, and watch it for date night with your sweetheart.it DOES give good stuff your couples to talk about, and real life situations that many of us experience- but we just don't get to go to Bora Bora to work it out!"
1,The Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen!,"I didn't have much in the way of expectations for this movie, so it wouldn't have taken much to elicit a laugh or two from me. Instead, however, I ended up witnessing the single worst piece of trash ever to be considered a motion picture.It was as if the pathetic attempts at comedy were written by a ten year old with a crap sense of humor. The Guitar Hero scene?! Are you kidding me?! How in the world did this ever get released to the big screen? It is not even worthy of direct-to-video.Seriously, avoid this at all costs, you will thank me."
1,Nothing original about this comedy.,This movie was bordering on boring with only a few laughs to keep you from falling asleep.
2,Predictable,"Very predictable plot. Rented the DVD and spent most of my time fast forwarding through out the whole movie. A major waste of time, talent and money. They too were probably more concerned about hopping on jet skis instead making a decent movie. Just pass on by..."
4,I know my Truth! I liked it - Blu-ray features are worth it,"Right off the bat, you need to be in a relationship to see this movie or have friends that are in relationships. This isn't swingers or some movie made for just guys. It is a relationship comedy.That said, I liked it. While most reviews here will give you the synopsis or the opinion, let me mention some of the features of the blu-ray disc. They, of course, have outtakes and how to make a movie in Bora Bora, but one of the features that is totally worth the purchase of the Blu-ray is the couples counseling outtakes. The director literally didn't yell ""Cut"" for some of the comedians/actors that came in for the counseling scenes. It is hysterical. Most of the main cast couldn't keep straight faces. I wish they kept these scenes in the movie. The counselors are great.So if you liked the movie or are looking for a decent Blu-ray with some good features, get this movie."
5,If you go to San Francisco..........................,"So many books about rock 'n roll are letdowns because they speak in generalities about the music without informing the reader of the circumstances that shaped it. SUMMER OF LOVE is an exception; it's a well-written, engaging chronicle of the music and the players in the Bay area from 1965 to 1971. Selvin lets history speak for itself, so you get the glorious and the ghastly with no punches pulled. The impression one is left with is that, whether you think the Haight-Ashbury thing was wonderful, tragic or a load of P.R. hype, it certainly was like no other scene and it left a lot of fine music in it's wake. A good one."
4,Rich and detailed.,"As rock is now redundant and is the classical music of the 20th century, I have been seeking out the great rock music of the past. Following a recent trip to San Francisco and Haight-Ashbury, I've been getting heavily into West Coast sixties psychedelia/hippy bands (although I was only 4 in 1967). This book was a great read and helped me understand the scene in more depth. I quickly gave up on keeping pace with the vast array of characters and players in this book and focussed more on the bands, the scene, and the events. This book is a must for any lover of rock music and is an important detailed historical document. Feed your head."
5,Must Read,"For as long as I can remember, I've been entranced by the music of Janis, Jerry...all the greats. Though I wasn't able to live through these crazy times, ""Summer of Love"" transported me back in time...almost to the point where I felt I was actually there for some of the madness. Joel Selvin definitely delivers with the true stories of the rises and falls of the likes of Janis Joplin, The Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, and many more. This is a must read for anyone with a true love of the peace/love time period."
3,Defective,"One of the 4 bottles had turned bad. It should have been obvious to the packer because it was a cloudy yellow color, unlike the other 3, which were blue.Too much trouble to report and return."
3,Not complete at all,"This book is NOT a companion to the box set recordings that feature all of Johnson's songs and alternate takes. This book has a partial arrangement every song, but not every take. The arrangements are not complete, and varies from song to song.There is not much guidance on playing, just the transcriptions. This may leave many people puzzled about how to approach the tunes, especially with using a slide and the alternate tunings and fingerings.Take a look at some of the other books available. Robert Johnson: The New Transcriptions is a much more complete effort, with accurate tunings and capo positions. Robert Johnson: At the Crossroads is a prior editon of the same book, and may be found a little cheaper."
3,ALMOST Complete,"None of the songs are complete. They don't contain any outros which leave you hangin'. They don't have all the lyrics. They don't have any of the capo placements. I don't mean to be entirely negative but they shouldn't advertize the word ""complete"" in the title if it's not. I love Robert Johnson's music and I was anxious to learn the COMPLETE songs. Instead I only learned the intro and the first verse of each song from this book. I've had to figure out the capo placements and the rest of the songs by listening to his cd which is extemely difficult and the reason why I bought this book in the first place."
4,WOW reminds me of Street Fighter.,"I am amazed when SNK made this game because it's 2D like Street Fighter. I like the way the fighters are designed, and It suppose to be a great new game. Anyway I also wanted to ask anyone this? can this be played on the XBOX 360?"
4,Still Valuable Collection of Essays,"This collection of essays came out in 1984 and is a little bit dated in light of more recent work on Rand. While the collection contains a couple of clunkers, it contains at least one real gem: J. Charles King's ""Life and the Theory of Value,"" the best refutation of Rand's ethics I'm aware of."
4,Canon's EF 28-80mm f/3.5-5.6 II Lens...,"Very Likely Your First Lens Will Be This One...They Are Incorperated Into Most Of The Canon Kits Available Today, And Why Not?...It Features The Most Popular Focal Lenghts...From Wide Angle To Telephoto, This Zoom Lens Gives You The Best Of Both Worlds...The Apature Is Kind Of Limited, But For A Starter Lens, This Is Great..."
3,not bad.... but you should consider paying a little more,"I, like most people, got this lens when buying a kit. Unlike one review, I found this lens to have excellent optics. While not quite like a Nikon lens, the quality of pictures the lens produces is more than enough for most users. For the past 4 years, I have thouroughly enjoyed using it. Unfortunately, something is not ligning up on the connections between the lens and the camera body and the camera is unable to read/set the aperture on the lens, therebye making it impossible to take pictures. I have used other lenses on the body, and they work fine, so I'm assuming it is a problem with the lens. Consider paying a little more when buying a lens... in the long run, it might save you money."
5,Very happy,"It was exactly what they said, brand new in the pkg and got here in great time! I would defiantly purchase through this company again of I got the chance."
3,ehhh...ok..,"I got this lens with my camera. It was great to learn on, but as soon as I learned a little bit about cameras and lenses I realized how mediocre in every way this lens is. It's worth the $59.99 price tag if you are on a tight budget...but if you can afford more do it. I've posted 10 or so pics taken with this lens in the product images. Slapping this lens on a high quality dslr is like putting Steve Buscemi's face on a super model..."
3,Holding a charge,"Can't complain about the price!! However, I am disappointed in the ability of the battery to hold a charge. I have pretty consistant phone use so I know how long a normal charge should last and this battery only holds a charge for about 2-3 days (I use my phone very little). This is less time than the battery it replaced. This may be a fluke but based on this performance, I wouldn't buy another one of these. Otherwise, good shipping."
4,works fine,"arrived ahead of schedule, appears new, works like new. I've bought from them before and will again."
3,Great toy until it breaks,"We got this toy for our daughter when she was almost 1 year old. It was great - songs were cute and not annoying, and the gears turning were cool to watch and she could pull out individual gears and see how that affected the movement. However, after only a few months, the toy stopped working intermittently. It would play songs, but not rotate. With some tweaking, we could get it to work on and off, but you never knew when. Finally, we just gave up and now it's just a piece of plastic with removable gear parts. When I ordered it, the price was $16, now it is $25 on Amazon and I feel like this is too much to pay for only a few months enjoyment. I'm ordering the Hasbro version to see if it fares better."
4,A rockin good time CD,"I have heard of Tommy Castro but this is the first CD I have brought from him. I have to say that I really enjoy this CD. There are some good rockin blues-rock songs such as "" If You Ain't Lovin, You Ain't Livin"", ""Blinded In The Face Of Love"". We also get some good down and dirty blues as "" Dirt Road Blues"". John Lee Hooker makes a small final appeance on ""Guilty Of Love"" even though I think his part was to short and could have been more instrumental to the body of the song. That aside, this is a great CD for fans of blues and of rock alike"
2,Disappointing,"I guess Tommy Castro was bound to hit a clinker sooner or later, and this album is that clinker. I had yet to be disappointed by any previous album, but frankly, this one hits so many sour notes you can safely pass. Only two songs, ""I Don't Want to Make That Call"" and ""Shakin the Hard Times Loose"" come close to capturing the energy of his previous albums. Even the buzz that John Lee Hooker would be on the title track is a disappointment. Hooker mumbles one sentence.If you only have one or two of his other albums, you'd be better served buying the recently released compilation. Tommy Castro and his group usually rock, but this album sinks like one."
3,okay,price is the most concern to buy this one and it's okay for my first DSLR. Good starter telephoto len.
5,Just as Advertised,Great lens. I gave it as a gift; just as advertised. This is a basic lens for any serious photographer or just someone having fun with photography. Thanks!
3,Update,"This is an update to my previous review. The unit arrived a DOA as previously described. The new unit arrived and seems to be working fine. I would rate it a four star but the DOA counts as a -1 star no matter what (works as described though there is some minor learning curve and the handle could be better suited for use off the table, its primary allure).Again, a good device."
2,Great idea - poor engineering,"I am a teacher, and I use a technology based instruction model (computer projector instead of chalk). The Gyro-mouse has it's potential, but the rechargeable battery life is poor. The keyboard similarly has it's problems. I would characterize the keyboard as flimsy. It's a nifty product at first, but it's lifespan is limited. It is not designed for serious use."
3,gyration mouse,This was a great item until it stopped working one day. I changed batteries and re set the receiver but it didnt help. I tried to contact the company but got no response. I finally sent it back to them for repair but it was refused and came back to me. All in all it worked for less than a year. Once they fix the bugs and get better customer service it should be a great item
1,"Ultra Mouse MISSING THE ""ULTRA""","Before Gyration Inc. can compete in the Mouse & Keyboard arena, they must learn to design products that are COMPLETELY in sync with Windows! I even took extra steps in downloading all drivers needed from the Gyration Website, but this slick and very design driven package still couldn't give an ""Ultra Performance"". The Keyboard would sometimes read and sometimes not...and the mouse would force Windows to crash! It's too bad, I wanted it to work. I guess I should stick to the ""Old School Products"" with more experience."
3,"DOA, though after a couple of replacements it is fine.","Showed up dead on arrival (receiver not functioning at all, tried it on at least three systems - ME, 2000, desktops and laptop).Customer support was friendly enough but they cannot raise the dead.I'll try a return and update the review once the replacement arrives.Update:I realize I have been remiss in not updating the review.After a couple of initial mis-haps (DOA and then the mouse died a couple of months later), the product has been working great (over 2 years of use). I think the idea is excellent, the implementation is novel and still novel even three years later. Amazon will not let me update the number of stars and DOA's are not forgivable in my book but it does seem as though they have worked out the bugs, at least in the one they shipped me.DP"
1,Fragile hooks holding on keys; poor customer support,"Hooks holding keys on keyboard are extremely fragile. Customer support has no replacement parts and says ""too bad, buy another keyboard""."
2,"2.5 stars. Good, but not worth full price","Well, after reading good reviews for this book, I bought it hoping for the best. And was disappointed to find a story with a weak female character, sexual tension and attraction that is non-existent between characters who supposedly fall in love, and a ludacrious ending that had me sitting back in my chair going, ""What?!?"" WHITE MOUNTAIN starts off strong, but the lack of character in Isabella and the secrets revealed at the end are a joke. Don't get me wrong, the idea/concept is great, but the final product left something to be desired.McCall's STORM WARNING is a beach book worth the effort. Get it instead."
3,"Good, but not great","This was a pleasant, readable book.It has a little bit of everything: mystery, romance, science fiction, cold war spying.I read it on the train, which it seemed perfect for, something to do that doesn't take up much space and keeps you quiet.It does drag a bit in some places, though.Some of the insights into how the cold war has evolved into modern international relations are intriguing.The ending has a nice twist, but I won't tell you what it is."
4,White Mountain,"White Mountain by Dinah McCall is an excellent must read. It leaves you on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen to the characters. When my boss handed it to me to read at work, I was sure that I wouldn't care for it but it was fantastic. And I am so glad that it had a happy ending where two people found each other. It was well written and the part about the Indian had me guessing until the end. Excellent reading."
3,It's O.K,"Some of Fiona WALKERS books are really really good, others are mainstream/a little boring. This one falls into the latter. Lucy is very gulible and times frustrating. Her family are interesting. Her boyfriends a looser and her next door neighbour is nice. There are some good moments in this book but then it goes back to a little boring, overall though its readable and at times very enjoyable."
2,DISAPOINTED,"NO SUBTITLE OR SCENE SELECTION.AMAZON SERVICE WAS GOOD, BUT THE MOVIE LOOKED LIKE A BOOTLEG.MOVIE I WOULD NOT RECOMEND THIS MOVIE. IT IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY"
2,Nothin' Special,"I am a huge Matrix fan, but I was disappointed with Animatrix. I went out and bought it the first day because I thought it would be great. My friends and I watched it together and were not impressed. Kid Story and Detective Story are the only two I really liked. Kid Story tells the story of the kid in Reloaded that is obsessed with Neo, so it is good to know the story behind him. Also, many of the stories tell a lot of the background info of Matrix, which is interesting. This video is something all Matrix fans should see, but don't buy it. You probably won't want to see it more than once or twice."
2,The Animatrix Gift Set (includes soundtrack),This animation is a mini series of different views of the Matrix. The series are like various examples of how the Matrix function. It could be interesting for the animation and matrix lovers. However i do prefer a single movie rather than short different series.
5,a great introduction,"Anyone interested in learning about Zizek should read this book. It is lively and accessible, a perfect way to get acquainted with a daunting thinker who writes faster than most of us read."
1,"not calming or relaxing, instead it raises your heart rate","this would be a nice recording if:1. the bowls weren't all being rung at once, then stopped, then suddenly starting again, which can actually startle a person.2. there was no 'reverb' sound, which in this recording, creates a 'beat'. this beat is very faced paced. it sounds a lot like a racing heart beat. so if you are trying to relax, but you hear this racing beat, it actually causes you to feel more anxious, and for your heart rate to go up. obviously this defeats the purpose of listening to Tibetan singing bowls for meditation!I heard it once and won't be listening to it again. I wish I hadn't bought it, to be honest.Nada Himalaya by Deuter is the only other Tibetan singing bowl CD I have, and I like that one much better ( it is actually calming and peaceful)."
2,Nope,I was hoping this would be more like Way To Katmandu by Karma Moffett. This wasn't very calming and it was boring at the same time?
1,Aggravatingly Repetitive,"I bought this CD to help me fall asleep, based on the raving reviews here. I am thoroughly disappointed. This recording is extremely boring... unimaginative, unmusical, and uninspired. Mr. Iobst's 'meditations' are So repetitive that I find them very agitating, Not relaxing. That said, I do find the sound of the resonant bowls very relaxing, and I would certainly consider a recording by a different artist."
5,Effective for meditation,"This is my first Tibetan singing bowl CD and it started to activate my 3rd eye chakra fairly early into my first serious listen. I put my stereo on volume 4 and used headphones. It made my forehead, hands and feet buzz and it was slightly uncomfortable on my forehead. I am somewhat used to the hands and feet vibrating, but not my forehead. The vibrational qualities came through the CD quite well and the sound is clear and wonderfully played. I only have one bowl which I play, but it cannot deliver the same kind of range."
4,Simply beautiful!,"This is great for just plain relaxation, or for use in deeper meditation. I am not heavily into Buddhist chanting, ""singing"" bowls, etc., but every now and then a truly nice piece comes along. This was one of them. I don't know what else to say about it beyond that - it's just plain soothing. But do NOT try to listen while driving {{grin}}."
5,Wonderful resonance!,"This is a neat cd. I like to listen to it after a particularly busy (stressful) day to help calm me down so I can breathe more easily again. This cd definitely does that. A bowl is tapped, others are tapped, and the sounds just run together in a slow resonance that is allowed to taper off at its own pace before another sound is started. It definitely has a calming effect after a whirlwind type of day - it just lets me kick out of gear and coast."
5,Yes,Most astounding CD. Induces deep meditation and healing.Take a mental journey as you relax and re-awaken your chakras!Just fantastic.
2,Mmmm... Coal Tar Extract... (drool),"I first came into contact with this when my roommate had some in the shower. I looked at it. It was deep brown in color, much like tobacco juice, and equally vile. I beleive the stuff must have some wonderful quality that justifies its existance, but I have yet to find it. I imagine an Herbal Extracts scenario with a woman showering in the rain; glueing her hands to her head and screaching in agony rather than writhing in extacy.Smelly and something to hide from guests. I give it two points just cus I'm nice and I feel bad for it."
1,He sucks,"He can't rap on beat, he can't keep a steady flow, he can't tell the difference between similes and metaphors. He just sucks."
5,Sickest lyricist out there,"with lyrics such as:""I turn on the sink, to rock to the rhythm of the water drops that come out, then i freestyle continuously till the whole New York reservoir run out""chino xl is truly the wittiest and sickest mc alive. although his beats may not be the best, listening to his lyrics is truly an amazing experience. if you want an mc with raw lyrical talent, chino xl is definitely something you MUST have."
5,it's a shame,it is a shame that this man is not signed to a major label he is one of the most overlooked emcee's out there and He is on my 50 greatest mc's list
2,Meaty but Overly Ambitious,"The author attempts a very ambitious mixture of spy thriller, domestic drama, and moral treatise. The book is most successful with the personal narrative regarding the protagonist's marital history. These passages ring true and have emotional depth. Particularly striking in their impact are several poignant and evocative family memories that made Dawson likeable and accessible. The spy thriller aspect, however, is routine (aside from the well-researched history), with seemingly obligatory lurid scenes that undercut the moral message. While the moral views expressed are astute, they are relayed in a jarring and stilted way that does not arise organically from the story. Judicious editing could have averted some of the awkward transitions into morality talk interludes."
4,Kraft and Dichter very good; Neidich misses point,"This recording is worth owning for the fine Kraft interpretations. He captures the intelligent, well balanced neoclassicism that Pulcinella represents. Likewise, Mischa Dichter's musicianship and pianism is always satisfying to hear. The disappointment on this recording is the Three Unaccompanied Clarinet Pieces. The first movement is okay. The second movement is approached with little of the humor or contrast that is required, and (to my surprise) Neidich is not always technically clean. The point of the last movement is entirely missed in a frenetic performance that is humorless and shapeless. Get this recording for Kraft and Dichter."
5,best blade for the buck!,"If you have anything less than a Benchmade Nimravus for a fixed blade combat knife, you are wrong! Great blade, 154CM steel, grips feel good. It's nice and thin and fits well in the hand, also very light weight."
1,terrible,"Well, I would rate the item, but seeing as how I never received, it that is a bit difficult. Amazon told me I did not give a valid address. However it is the same address I used to have all of my other mail delivered to. So now I'm a few dollars in the hole and I still have no book."
5,Mother Mary's teachings for the New World,This book is a very inspiring book and give a lot of information about the spirituality of a human being. It gives spiritual uplifting and give spiritual meaning about the real sense of our existence in this world.
1,Mary used falsely,"This book is not in keeping with any Biblical or traditional understanding of Mary or Christianity. The author takes the image of Mary and incorporates this with new age ""self"" focused spirituality. While this is the author's right since this is a free country, I think this book is very misleading as it appears to be promoting traditional Catholic spirituality. It focuses on the ""god"" within us. While this is part of Christian belief in God it is much too ""self centered"" to be a full and complete spirituality. Definitely new age."
5,Quite a bit of hard to find information here,"I have Connell's database book, and his other Microsoft Book on Coding Techniques. So, I purchased this book because I was so pleased with the other 2. This is excellent. If you wish to build a control - he covers both client and ASP.NET. And if you have a really good idea for a control, he goes into several advanced licensing techniques. Probably my favorite chapter is on encryption. I can see why Microsoft wanted Mr Connell to write another book. He has a keen sense of knowing what readers want and can explain his thoughts with crystal clearity."
3,Okay book,"Goes very deep into building .Net controls including some licensing models and some encryption. However, it doesn't talk much about the why of coding. John Connell just tells you how to do it. He does not explain why you would use certain methods or components.So, if you wanted to know the ""whys"" of coding, this book is not for you."
2,Not particularly useful for ASP.NET programmers,"The book had no real vaulable informaiton for an ASP.NET programmer. The book similar to this, written in C#, is so much better even if you have to translate the C#. I do not recommend this book if you're working in the ASP.NET environment. I can not speak to WinForms and this book, but the C# book will work fine for both environments."
1,What does it contain?,"I'm with the first reviewer. For a long time now, i'm trying to find this book's table of contents. It's not in MSPress site or anywhere else. I'm really sick and tired of shallow or no books on .NET Controls and the amazon reviews are also misleading these days. May be there is not much going on at Redmond after the initial fluff , i guess ;)"
4,"For beginners, it can be a pain.","I am a beginner. I heard great reviews about this particular lens. However, for a beginner, it takes some getting used to. I find myself reverting back to my 18-55mm kit lens for ease of use. I know that I will get better at taking shots with this lens because with its f/1.8, it can take better pics in less light. I have a newborn baby and I don't want to use the flash on my camera, so this lens (after I get used to it)is going to be the lens I use in the house."
4,Took Great! photos for the Price.,This lens took great! photos for the money you paid for. this is an above average lens. If you have money get the L class lens.
1,flaw,"Had to return the lens as it had a flaw inside the glass. It was chipped? right in the centre of the glass lens inside. It did arrive quickly and was shipped and packaged great, but the product was defective."
5,Perfect Lens,"This lens is absolutely PERFECT. It gives me exactly the look I want out of my pictures, it gives me a crisp subject w/ a very shallow depth of field. So far I've used it for an Engagement Session and a Senior session, and I've loved the pictures that I got using this lens."
5,Great affordable lens. Must have!,"This lens is absolutely beautiful. Great for low light conditions. I haven't stopped using it since! Done several photo/video shoots with it and it's holding up well. If you want a cheap, crisp/sharp lens, this lens is for you. Every Canon DSLR owner must have this lens in their collection at least one time in their life!Edit: April 23rd.The Lens has fallen apart months ago due to crashing into a bus post lol; but was able to put together. Recently, the lens fell apart trying to take off a stuck filter. Able to put it back together but seems like I've stripped the gears so now I'm off to buying a second. Great lens other than plastic build. I might keep the ""broken"" one to use manually or as back up."
5,cheap amd fast,"The canon 1.8 50mm ""Plastic Fantastic"" is cheap, light, and fast. The 50mm is well suited for portraits. Quality glass in a cheap plastic housing. A good value for a prime lens. (Focus is not USM). Highly recomended if you can't afford $325 for the f1.5 0r $1450 for the f1.2"
3,Canon EF50mm F/1.8 II,"Pros:1. Cheap I got for $118(including Tax + shipping)2. AutoFocus is very nice and fast.3. Picture Quality is good.4. very portable and light.Cons:1. Build Quality is cheap( cheap Plastic is used), when you tap on lens it sounds like empty can.2. The Autofous make sound so if you are doing video it will be recorded.Suggestion to canon:Kindly upgrade the plastic quality a bit even if it cost extra $20 per piece."
4,Nice starter portrait lens.,This lens creates some very nice images. The focus can be erratic occasionally but most of the time works nicely. Body is plastic. So far no problems here but it's to soon to say.
5,love the fixed lens/great vendor,"This lens is great for the money. It is a plastic body, but the lens is still the Canon quality we love. So far, i am quite happy with the lens. Using a fixed lens brings me back to my photographic roots. As for the Vendor.... AWSOME!!!!! got the lens quicker than expected, very easy to do to business with."
4,Works better then it looks.,"If you just bought a Canon SLR/DSLR with a standard boxed zoom, this is a very inexpensive upgrade that will give your camera much more flexibility with lower lighting situations. I was concerned with the Gray Market flag, but really there was nothing to worry about. I received the lens fast and in perfect condition. I would recommend buying a 52MM filter to protect the lens. The lens is small and light, and presents your camera with a rather underwhelming appearance, but the nice pictures you will get, especially with a lens at this price point will make up for it."
4,It responded to my expectations,"I am satisfied with this lens, but it has the limitation of being a fixed lens luminosity compensated for this inconvenience. Good lens. It has given me good results in low-light environment, is what I expected."
4,Disposable,"But it, use it, throw it away when it breaks. It makes great images and has great glass for the price. One of my favorite lenses, most of which are L Series..."
3,too tight,"quality of shots is ok , but one thing i observe . it is too tight when you insert on camera slot compare to other lens ."
1,Great product but really BAD delivery service choice,"This product was a bargain that feature very great bokeh or shallow depth of field. I'm using this mainly for videos which works wonderful.Now the downside and it's mainly the poor choice made by the seller or Amazon which was to choose USPS as the shipping carrier. Really terrible choice. USPS did not bother to deliver the product to your house or even try so beware! If they know you live all the way down the block, those lazy ass usps bastards will not bother try to walk all the way down or even in unlocked gated community."
5,Great for gluten free baking,"I bought this to make waffle sticks for my food allergic son. We LOVE it. Gluten free baking tends to be more successful when making small things (like mini-muffins vs. a regular sized muffin). I used my standard gluten/dairy/egg free pancake recipe and added a little extra oil (about 1 Tbsp). They came out GREAT. The whole family enjoyed them. The little dipping cups were great for holding the right amount of syrup without too much waste.I make a whole batch, break them into sticks and freeze. They then toast up quickly straight out of the freezer in a wide slot toaster. Great for an easy, quick middle of the week breakfast!I also found it easy to pour just the right amount of batter, unlike our round belgian waffle maker. Make sure to spread the batter with a spatula before closing the top. That makes it easier to tell if you've poured the right amount."
1,"I loved this product, until it broke","I loved this product. It made great waffles, but then it just stopped working. Of course, the 90-day warranty expired two weeks before. I only used it about 8 times. I probably won't buy a factory reconditioned item again."
3,Breakfast can be fun,"My kids love the waffle sticks this makes. It took a while to a hang of the right amount of batter, so there were quite a few that weren't quite up to snuff at first. The recipes included are very tasty. The leftover waffle stick freeze and reheat well which can make for a good breakfast on the go. All in all a nice little item if you like making waffles on the go."
3,a reference rather than a book to learn from,It's not a bad book for someone who already knows the stuff. It explains the details but not the big picture. It's great to came back to after you have understood the ideas. I'm a correspondence student and I find it preposterous that the more difficult the math the less instruction is offered.
3,Different Editions and an Errata,"I just wanted to point out the following:* The reviews dated prior to the year 2003 refer to earlier editions of the book. The current (3rd) edition was rewritten extensively.* A list of corrections is available on the Internet. The review guidelines discourage posting URLs, but an internet search with the keywords ""stewart galois theory errata"" should find the location. You need a postscript reader to view the errata, but a free one is available online."
1,TYPOS!! (plus some more major errors),"Some reviews mention typos. This book has so many typos that it is certainly not useful as a tool to learn Galois Theory. I had this book for a class in Galois Theory and there is at least one mistake for every page. (some mistakes more than typos in fact)I cannot be more sure when I say ""do not purchase this book"" If you do, you will regret it. Sorry I can't type more, but I have a final in my Galois Theory class that I have to study for... the book is NOT helping.Cheers"
2,Many mistakes spoil the book,"If you buy this book, be sure to find the half a dozen(!) pages of errata. Then reserve a few hours to go through almost every page to correct the many mistakes. Be warned! This book could have been very nice if it weren't for the many mistakes."
4,The Second Book of Baritone Solos,This is my favorite baritone book of the series. The repertory is very usable and not as obscure as tjat of the other books.
5,As advertised,"Cookware is excellent. Nothing sticks and have washed them in the dishwasher with no discoloration. Seems to perform at least as well as miscellaneous Calphalon, Cuisinart and All Clad we own.Update: After owning and using it for two years, still very pleased with it. Holding up very well to dish washing and the use of appropriate plastic cooking tools."
3,Good quality but...,And the but is this is still very vulnerable to have the non stick surface scratch and eventually wear off just like most other non stick cookware. Nice marketing ploy. I don't want PFOA's in my cookware and I don't want aluminum just underneath the surface because it is toxic as well. You have been warned.
1,Todays Concept,Todays Concept did not deliver my order by the promise date and did not respond to inquiries until I cancelled the order. I reordered through a non Amazon vendor.
1,Save your money,I have used and tested this watch on a compass course and real world. I had nothing but problems out of it. The compass almost never gives correct bearings even when calibrated the only thing it will do accurately is tell time. Money is better spent on a Suunto or Casio pathfinder.
1,A lecture not a book,"I am an admirer of this author: his brilliant insights, the warmth and humanity he brings to his studies of important ancient Jewish works. I thought I was buying his study of the Pharisees. Instead I found merely a lecture on the subject. It still had some great insights but I was disappointed. This pamphlet needed a subtitle: ""A lecture given ... ."""
5,Powerful!,Craigs music is powerful and delightful. My wife plays the CD at social gatherings for friends and family. I play the CD during my meditation time at home. I recommend every one get their hands on this wonderful CD. We love the entire compilation. Thanks Craig.Carlton & Violet Thompson
5,Relaxation Music,"This music is very relaxing. I listen to it whenever I am stressed, and it calms me down almost instantly. I hope there is much more to come."
5,There is Always a victim in Love.,"Fatal Love is one of those rare book that while delving into science fiction style themes seems to be closer to the present day reality that the fantasy it walks among. With gaming, 3D role playing becoming more and more common and replacing the movie going world rapidly Fatal Love gives us an interesting story where truth and fiction mingle with unimaginable consequences. Though out of print Fatal Love is certainly not out of style. Teen runaways, adultery and it's consequences are just a few of the themes that run through this unique entertaining novel."
3,Plastic closure plugs,This unit is spoiled by the inclusion of two cheap plastic closure plugs instead of conventional metal plugs found on other boxes.
4,Prolifica historia,"A mi en lo personal me fascina la manera tan creativa y el pensamiento tan suelto que tiene Vargas Llosa. Esta historia llena de aventuras que van desde lo mas insolito hasta lo puramente ordinario, no puede ser otra cosa que el resultado de este maravilloso autor, para mi es una de sus mejores sin quitarle puntuacion a sus otras obras por supesto,En su narracion logras sentir las aventuras que giran alrededor de la casa editorial, las tardes narradas son facil de palparlas y las mil y una peripecia para lograr las notas del periodico.. Formidable!"
3,término medio,"Es un lente complejo, es económico, la construcción es solida, los resultados son descentes con buena luz, pero con poca luz es muy deficiente, pues no es muy luminoso, se debe tener muy buen pulso o utilizar un tripode. ultimamene lo estoy combinando con unos lentes macro que se colocan frente al lente, son como lupas y he tenido resultados interesantes.Lo he usado en el rango de los 70mm a los 200 mm para retrato y da buenos resultados, más de 250mm ya no es bueno el resultado.Olviden usarlo en esposiciones de 1/30 o 1/40, la falta de estabilizador se siente mucho, y las fotos salen subesxpuestas, además no enfoca muy rápido. si esta pensando en un lente de este ranfgo, creo que le vendría mejor un 55-250 que viene con estabilizador de imágen y esta por el mismo rango de precio, y si tiene buen presupuesto, les recomiendo el fijo 300 de la serie L, de lo mejor de canon."
2,Its autofocus is very bad in indore operations or Night operations,Though its not a bad deal for 99 + 6$ yet this is not for professionals.
5,great value at the right price,"wonderful optics at the right price and . the service was fast, better than i expected. this was the first time i purchased anything through amazon. the relationship will continue."
3,useless without a tripod,I tried it inside the building without a tripod and most pictures were useless because it doesn't have Image stabilization. I'm planning to sell it on ebay.
1,Canon's Worst Ever,"I have been photographing professionally for 36 years and virtually all 35mm in my inventory is Canon, so I am more than aware of the quality optics which they can produce. However, this is patently the worst lens I have ever seen Canon roll off the assembly line. Even at the higher shutter speeds (1/1250) and on a tripod as well, this lens lacks any degree of sharpness.Do NOT purchase this lens unless you're an absolute Novice and will be photographing the family pet romping in the backyard. Save you money and go with a higher-end model."
4,Great for What it's Suppose to Do,"This is a ""cheap"" telephoto lens for a ""cheap"" camera but both are excellent if you remember not to expect too much - it works great for what I need it for but have to remember I'm not going to get wonderful shots with movement, especially sports and other action shots - for the price of the camera and the lens I'm very satisfied - in fact, very, VERY satisfied - if I want something professional I'll have to spend a lot more money - would recommend the Canon Rebel EOS and this zoom lens to anyone, novice or pro - just don't expect to have Sports Illustrated quality photos . . . and remember to hold it as steady as you can!"
2,Not really a very good lens,"This lens is inexpensive, and it shows in terms of poor image quality, among other things. Unless you simply cannot afford something better, I would stay away from this one. I had it for a very short period of time before I got rid of it. Then again, at the price it is being offered, one cannot have too much grounds for complaint."
4,Canon Zoom Lense,"The Canon EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 III Telephoto Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras does pretty much everything I wanted it to do with the exception of taking action shots. It's a little slow for shots with a lot of movement. However, I recently took a head shot of my Drum Horse ""Oreo"" at the state fair from about 30 yards away and I was in awe of the result. I have since blown up and framed the shot and now have it hanging in my office. The pros for this lense far outweigh the cons."
3,Its a good starter lens,"Pictures in low light conditions were not that good, pictures at mid-range were ok, I could take better portraits with it than zoom shots.My cousin dropped it once(rolled off the car seat); the drop broke off the AF/MF button. I have still been able to use it though it has trouble auto focussing."
1,Just awful. Skip this lens.,"Returned it in 2 days. Just awful. Poor focusing and lots of hunting for focus on my Digital Rebel. Slowness made every shot underexposed. Lens mounted to the camera losely, so you could wiggle the lens. Lens gave error 99's on the EOS.Avoid this product.Update: Purchased the Canon EF 75-300mm f4-5.6 IS USM Telephoto Zoom Lens and it is absolutely wonderful. Worth the extra money for better glass, Image stabilization, and faster focusing."
2,Save Your Money,"I purchased the 75-300mm for a trip to a NASCAR Nextel Cup Championship in Homestead, FL. I was mostly disappointed with the lens from the beginning. The lens is not very sharp, feels very cheap, and the autofocus is slow and hilariously innaccurate in low light.I packed up and returned the lens about an hour after I got off the plane. I am going to save my money for something sturdier and with a better maximum aperture.I suggest you do the same."
5,Excellent value foe the moola!,"As of this writing there is a major retailer that has this lense for under $100.00, anyway this lense is excellent. People scream it has no IS, etc... It doesnt need IS unless you are shooting at very low shutter speeds in low light, and if so why are you not using a tripod? I took this out today for a test drive along side my 55-250mm IS lense, and this lense competes just fine with its IS cousin. Seriously unless you just have $$$ to burn on L lenses, grab this one today, especially as if you hurry you might be able to ""target"" that sale price that is under $100.00. :)"
4,Useful zoom lens,"Here is a zoom lens that produces good photos, but not as good as I get with my Canon 28-105 mm lens. I am overall satisfied with it and USM is a definite plus. However, do not expect astonishingly clear pictures from this lens! And you really have to use a tripod to get the most out of it. I do not carry this lens out most of the time in the camera bag because it is rather heavy. Buy it only if you need the zoom. I have experienced no mechanical or optical problems with this lens and therefore quite satisfied."
5,Telephoto lens,"I use this particular lens for surveillance work and it is a must in the P.I. Field. Very effective with clear results...and the best part is that you're far enough away that the subject can't here the shutter,lol."
4,Nice product,"This lens has been a nice complement to our Rebel XT. Fast focus and nice zoom range. Highly recommended. However, for indoor photography at high zoom, the built-in flash on the Rebel XT is not strong enough, so be forewarned that you may need to buy a flash as well..."
2,Worth every penny,"This lens is cheap, and for a reason. It won't focus sharply when the aperture is wide open, so it's hard to get shots with a narrow depth of field but sharp focus on the subject. Its high f-number means you pretty much need sunlight or a tripod to avoid camera shake, and forget about action shots unless it's full sunlight. It also has very bad chromatic aberration; this may be corrected by a UV filter, but I haven't tried it. It shows purple halos around dark objects when they're set against a bright background.The lens does have very nice autofocus, though. It's very fast, especially after it's found the general distance of your subject and it just has to make minor corrections for different shots.Overall, this is a good lens for learning to frame shots and use a zoom lens, but its quality is low and it's not good for much more than learning."
2,"Great budget lens, but the picture quality is terrible.","Pros: VERY cheap telephoto lensThe amount of zoom is greatIt takes clearer pictures at lower zoom than higher zoomIt matches my camera?Cons: VERY cheap telephoto lensTruckloads of chromatic abberation! (see the uploaded picture of the squirrel in the tree)Fuzzy pictures at full zoom ISO 800 (Canon T2i)Other Thoughts: In my opinion, the EF-S 55-250mm f/4-5.6 IS is a much better lens for the money. It may not have quite the zoom, but there is almost no chromatic abberation, and the image stabilization make it 300% better. Make sure to do your research on both lens to find the right one for you."
3,There is a time and place for this lens.,"You can lose a ton of shots using this lens. It is not sharp at 300, though you can get some nice shots and a decent depth of field if you are taking a portrait.It is a good lens to learn with, but if you are looking to get really clear crisp shots using this lens, you are going to be disappointed. It is definitely worth it to get the 55-250mm for however much more."
2,Poor image quality,"I bought this lens on a killer clearance deal after missing an opportunity for some nice shots of a coyote. I just wanted a simple lens for an occasional wildlife snapshot. The image quality was so bad, I took it right back to the store. It is unlikely my expectations were too high, as I love my Rebel XTi (400D) kit lens, which is considered one of Canon's worst. I picked up a Tamron lens of similar focal length and have been reasonably happy with it. I'd steer clear of this one unless you just want an SLR to look cool."
4,tacocat,good quality lens at a resonable cost. great for use with a tripod. if not using a tripod you should invest the extra money and the lens with the image stabilazation.
5,canon ef 75-300mm telephoto zoom lens,I am not a pro so when I wanted to buy a telephoto lens there were a lot of choices. After a lot of thought I decided to go with a less exspensive lens and I have been happy with the choice so far. The one problem that I have had with it is indoors using the flash. This causes the worst red eye I have ever seen. I have taken a lot of shots so far and I am happy with it.
4,I like it a lot,In the short time I've owned the lens I've been very pleased with the performance of the lens. It's not perfect but very good for my needs.I take a lot of pictures of birds this lens allows me to shoot from a range where I don't scare the birds.
4,amazing lens,this is an amazing lens but it miss the stabilizer. on this type of lenses you for low light shots any small move will destroy the img
2,"It's not a good lens, but a good value for a beginner.","The lens is an entry level lens and would be well served to have IS built in. But even in ideal conditions (good lighting, fast shutter speed, tripod mounted), it is still a subpar performer. The images aren't crisp and sharp and the colors are a little flat. It does allow for a nice enough bokeh (background blurring) when taking photos of someone 15 feet away or so. Generally that isn't easily accomplished by the 18-55 kit lens.Good photos can be taken with this lens... but more photos will be lost due to blurring or simply not being crisp enough.If you are on the fence as to whether you will use your DSLR, then this may be a good option. If it turns out you really like it, then invest in the 55-250mm. If you are starting out and you KNOW you will like it, then invest in a 55-250mm from the start."
4,Good Lense,"I have not use this lense fir many picture, I use it for about 5 pictures. It took good quality pictures, ease of use"
5,This lens is awesome,"I recieved this lens a few days ago using it with my digital rebel xt and for the money this is worth every penny. The shots i took with it are super. For anyone who has a canon digital slr and does not want to spend 500-1000 for a lens, this is the one to add to your camera bag."
3,get something else if you can,"I bought this a few months ago and I already want to upgrade. I'm using it on a T2i and I get decent results, but like everyone says, IS would really help at those longer focal lengths. I'm going to start looking for the 55-250mm which looks great. This lens will get you started in telephoto photography, and I've even made some decent photos with it, but having to shoot at f/8 all the time sucks. Focus speed is decent but it has a very long way to go from infinity to 3 feet and it will hunt back and forth sometimes which makes me want to throw the lens off of a speeding train. I also think one reason for having a tele is to capture detail of something in a tight frame, and at 75 to around 250 this lens does an okay job, but at 300mm the detail gets lost, even it you get good focus and are stopped down. Bottom line, get something else."
5,75-300mm,"Got a great picture of the moon with this lens! I do wish it had stabilization, but for the price you can't beat it."
4,Not a bad deal for the money.,"I can not afford the best in the world from Canon and this lens is what I expected for the money. It's not like my best lens when it comes to feel, quality and construction but, for the price, it's a good deal. You must be careful when installing it on the camera becasue it doesn't ""snap"" in place like the kit lens. Just make sure it's on and all is well. The picture quality is good and crisp. the colors are good so over all, I have no complaints. I have a 55-250 and bought the 75-300 for a little more zoom and am happy I did."
4,Great lens,"A great product for the price. The lens is ""fast"" enough for almost every application, and the wide zoom range lends itself to most situations. It is compatible with the Canon system and works in the auto-focus or manual-focus mode. I am pleased with this product."
5,Canon EF 75-300mm Zoom,This lens works very well with all canon cameras. It is particularly good for action shots of sports and bird watching. It is OK for floral closeups but op for a macro lens if possible.
4,Great lens for a good value - use a tri- or mono-pod though,"The Canon EF75-300 is a good lens for the price. Canon quality is really good, and pictures taken turn out great if you have used a tripod or monopod to hold the camera steady. I will say if you don't frequently have something to steady the camera on, it will be hard to keep distance shots crisply in focus. The extra cost of the IS lenses (image stabilization) is a lot to bear, but may mean the difference between a great shot and a missed opportunity."
2,Save the money for a better one !,Have had this lens for a couple of months now and I now regret that I did not do enough research before I shelled out a couple of hundred bucks on this one. The lens is really soft even when really stepped down. Planning to sell it off as soon as I can do it to go for a better telephoto lens.
3,Can do without it,"Here's the deal: I have an 18-135 mm EFS AF IS Canon lens, which provides for a decent zoom. I would say its quality is better than this one (from all the reviews I've read).I was considering getting the 75-300 for the added zoom only, but decided to run an experiment. I took a picture with my 18-135 lens with the best possible settings at 135mm. Then I cropped the picture to get the equivalent of what the 300 would have given me. Even zooming in in the pictureI got me pretty good results. I haven't tried the 75-300 as such (they have a pretty lousy return policy here) but I can bet it will give me no better results. So I saved myself $150."
3,Canon EF 75-300,"This product has no ""Image Stabilizer"" feature. It is not important if the lens has USM and there is no need to be EF-S type."
3,Good Starter,"It's a good starter, but you'll run into a lot of trouble at night.If you have the chance to use the IS version of this lens, I strongly suggest it.Consider buying a tripod or something similar unless you have a very steady hand."
4,Budget lens that kicks butt,"I've had my Canon Digital Rebel with the kit lens for six months and have finally purchased the 75-300 f4-5.6 III USM, and I love it. Yes it is a budget lens, but it does not feel cheap, and it does everything you would expect of a lens of this category. I almost purchased a Sigma, but a phone call to the local camera shop convinced me to go with this lens instead. I am glad I did. I've shot handheld and used a tripod. I usually shoot many more than one shot at a time (who doesn't) so I am not bothered by the occasional blur my heart beat causes. Outside it is fantastic. Inside it works just fine at 75mm. It is what it is, a great lens for the money - worth every penny."
3,Worth the Price,"This may not be the best lense out there, but for the price I believe I'ts a great value. I plan to use this lense on a tripod, with a remote control switch. With the camera on servo.It's a Canon lense, and they are usally known for quality. It just depends on what you plan to use it for, and what you expect of it. For the price my expections were exceeded."
4,Excellent Lense,"I bought this lens for my Rebel 2000 camera and have been very pleased with the results. I never use autofocus, but the AF feature when I played with it was very fast and accurate. I got the best pictures by using an all-around 800 Max film with this lens."
3,Depends on your expertise and budget.,"Most experienced photogs wouldn't waste their time with this lens, but for a newbie or someone on a limited budget, it is fine. It is best in good lighting conditions, but you may have to fiddle with the aperture and ISO in low light. Then it will be grainy, anyway. And it won't really bring in the subject from very far away, but no 300mm will. So don't expect stunning nature photos or NASCAR photos from the cheap seats. The images I posted are from 50' away from the subject at most (Cedar Waxwings) and they have some grain even at ISO 100, but most people think they are decent enough. Anyway, it is a good way to get into a longer telephoto on the cheap. Enjoy, but understand its limitations."
3,"Ok for the money, but there are better options...","This lens is a popular entry level zoom. For the money you get a pretty big zoom range and ok quality in good light. For a little more you can get the EF 100-300 f/4.5-5.6. The 100-300 features ring-type USM which allows full-time manual focus--that means you can adjust the focus manually without switching to manual mode. Also the focus is quicker and quieter without rotating or extending the front element so the use of circular polarizers is easier.If you can afford the extra money, I would recommend the 100-300 as a budget telephoto zoom. If not, this one is ok but not good."
4,It was good enough for me.,"I have EOS Revel T1i, and very very beginner. That being said: I have 10-22mm ultra-wide, and 18-55mm standard zoom, and they are both fine, but I just wanted a lens that goes above 55mm.So here it is. I do not have any complain about the picture quality so far, I just wanted to see what 300mm is like, and its definitely a different world, and I am happy to know that. USM is pretty nice too, so you may want to spend a few more bucks on it to get it. My standard zoom lens has standard motor and its slow and noisy. Anyway, I got what I expected, and again, I am happy."
3,"great value, but you will desire more shortly","well, everyone needs one.. and for many (including myself) this is the first step in the telephoto road. yes, the value is there, and for the casual photographer that ""just needs a telephoto"", this will work out.what you will soon discover is that with a aperture of 5.6. you will get some blurred shots as the sun goes down (or indoors). you will also find that the clarity and resolution at full zoom just isn't there upon close inspection. my brother and myself took the same photo several times. I was using a 300mm prime, and he was using this lens.. the difference was amazing. even I didn't think it could make that big of a difference going into a prime lens. the image was easily 3 times the clarity and resolution on cropped images.now, don't fret, for the average point and shoot crowd, this will be a very nice step into the telephoto world, but if you are like many, you will be saving your change for the next lens after about 6 months."
4,great,"typical canon lens awesome use great pics, good low light, and animals looking for more as well and now one"
2,Not bad for a novice user,I bought this along with my Canon XS as part of a packaged deal in 2008. I have used this lense about 4 times. I like the reach but that's about it.Sorry but this lense just doesn't do it for me as the focus is slow and the images are just not sharp. Honestly if you want something I would suggest the 70-300 usm or even the 70-200 f/4 L. The build quality on this lense is cheap. The focus ring is small (obviously most of the users will be using autofocus anyways). The filter does move whenever you focus (not good). There is no image stabilization either.I wouldn't recommend this lense unless it was pretty much free.
5,Magnificent,The operation of the lens is spectacular and the cost is very low. The quality of the photos I can take now is great. An excellent product.
5,So glad I bought this!!,I am so glad I bought this lens. I have a smaller lens that came with the camera when I bought it. The pictures turn out so much better with this lens at a distance than with the small lens. I am going to put this lens to good use on vacation.
2,Cheap works ok until it breaks,"These lenses have an inherent problem. All of a sudden you get a message that the lense can not communicate with the camera, ( Clean your contacts ) well clean your contacts all you want it will not fix the problem. The problem is internal in the lense. The good news is you can send the camera off to Canon with an estimate repair cost of about $ 130 dollars, the bad news for a few dollars more you can buy a new one. Bottom line do not buy this lense buy a better one for a few hundred dollars more, in the end you will get much better pictures and it will work much longer then the year mine did."
4,Fast Pitch Softball photography,"I read all there was to know about this lens versus the more expensive lens with a auto focus stabilizer. For outdoor sports, which is why I bought this lens, it works great. I have had very few blurred photos, but that could be operator error. I have been taking photos of fast pitch softball and some baseball and love the photos I am getting."
3,OK Lens - good for price,"I was a little disappointed in this lens for my purposes. It just wasn't as sharp as I wanted. I returned it and spent the extra for the 70-200 f/4L and am much happier. That being said, it wasn't a bad lens at all. If you don't want to spend the extra, or just like snapping shots for your own enjoyment and not to publish, it would probably be fine."
2,A Paper Lens,"While this lens has an attractive price tag, this lens has serious trouble with sharpness. Only at high shutter speeds (1/250 and above approx.) or with a good flash and middle apertures (f/8 to f/22 approx.) does it deliver sharp images. Horribly slow autofocus. I am already saving to buy and L-series or the IS USM version."
3,good quality missing and important feature,"i bought this lens so i coulld take picture of performers up on stage or of people playing sports, my problem with it was that unless you are using a tripod and a remote there was no way to operate this lens at its maximum focal poitn without blurryness on the picture caused by even slight movement of the camera such as pressing the shutter button, i would recommend people pay a little extra for the canon 55-250mm with IS, which prevents camera shake and makes shots that much easier"
4,basic tele lens,Provides a good basic addition to the lens collection that can be used for everyday school sporting events as well as other outdoor activities requiring some distance from the action.
2,Question,Dear allcould u plz help me to know if this product is suitable for my camera or not?My camera's model is Canon Rebel XS EOSEf-s 18-55 ISplease help me before I puy it!
1,Damaged!,I bought this item a few months ago but i didn't use it then...!I started using it last week and the results were surprising and shoking!I didn't get any decent fotograph-I was so mad that i didn't try it right away when i bought it...I paid for something i can't even use...
2,CANON EF-75-300 F/4-5.6III TELEPHOTO ZOOM LENS,"WAS NOT IMPRESSED WITH THE QUALITY OF THE PICTURES,THIS LENS HAS NO STABILIZER FEATURE MAKING IT HARD TO USE FOR A BEGINNER,GO AHEAD AND PAY THE EXTRA FOR ONE OF THE CANON LENS THAT HAS THE STABILIZER FEATURE,I HAVE ALREADY SOLD THIS LENS AND GOTTEN THE BETTER LENS,"
1,Kids Toy,I feel very strongly that this product shouldn't even be sold except maybe as a toy.I don't think you should have to use a tripod to get a clear picture but with this lens it seems like you almost have to.I wasted my time and money on this and lost a few bucks for shipping along the way.
1,Worst lens I ever purchased,"The price should have clued me in, but this was--without a doubt--the worst lens I ever purchased. I used it twice, and sold it off to purchase the 70-300 IS in its stead. The price of this lens should tell you something: don't buy it!"
1,horrible support,"cannot tell if lens is okay because of horrible canon support for rebel t4i camera. did not work upon receipt, support says send it to them for replacement, they tie up purchase for weeks, then they say they will send refurbished. $1000 for refurbished camera! canon support is horrible, insulting, condescending, ran me around in circles and hung up on me. imagine its the same for all canon products. products too expensive for me to get this kind of treatment and too many other good cameras out there."
4,Excellent Lens,"This lens was everything I was expecting and more. For my price range and photography level, I couldn't ask for more. The zoom worked quite well and is even better than the lens I had for my old 35mm. Auto-focus takes about a second longer than my standard lens, but speed is not an issue for most of the things I photograph. Great purchase for a novice photographer looking to get that picture from a little further away."
1,Canon Lens,"I am not happy with this product because one of the contacts on the lens will work for a few minutes then I keep getting ERR 99.I have tried to contact CPHORSE several times with no reply.It seems like this is common with this seller.He doesnt't want to have any returns.I now have to send the lens to Canon Tech Center to get fixed, which i am very unhappy about."
2,Tough for sports,"An OK lens for shooting fixed objects and panoramas, but the autofocus is frustratingly slow and almost impossible to use on moving subjects. Limited utility of this lens may explain why it is now often found at fire sale prices."
3,"Good lens, but check out some others","This is a solid telephoto zoom for the amatuer photographer. However, the Canon EF 75-300 USM is a tad quieter, is exactly the same optics, and is often sold on Amazon at the same price as this lens (normally there is about $30 difference).The only drawbacks with this lens is the zoom control, which could be smoother; filter rotation to the front (but that's standard in this price range); lack of lens hood (and Canon is very pricey on this accessory); and poor warranty length.A nice upgrade would be Canon's EF 100-300. Similar priced lenses to look at include the Tamron / Promaster 70-300. Both have longer warranties, include lens hoods, and focus closer. Both are a bit nosier than the Canon lenses."
3,it's ok,"As far as lenses go I'm not an expert by any means. But I would say if you can afford $100 for a lens then these are pretty good. But I would recommend saving up or footing the bill for a more expensive one, as you get good shots with this, but I think they could be better. I have a T2i and the shots I get from this are decent, but I have a feeling could be a lot better with a higher quality lens. It's good for the price."
4,image stabilization,just remember that at this price there is no image stabilization. So bright light and fast shutter speeds are called for. a good lens none the less.
4,Just What I Expected,"This was a great purchase at $150. I bought it to shoot amateur pictures of family at youth football games. The images are sharp across the football field on a sunny day, I use the Canon monopod and recommend it. It's 75-300mm so I have to switch out lenses to take pictures of people standing close to me. There was a 28-200mm lens but it was much more expensive and I like having the extra zoom."
3,Nice but...,"The lens is good for the price, but it comes with one problem that it drains the battery a lot faster because it is motor based zoom. Good for amateurs, if you have more money go for Canon EF 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM"
2,"Go for the 55-250 IS, for a little more money it delivers much better results","I own the 55-250 IS and I've been using it for a while. I borrowed this lens the other day just to test it, and it was terrible in comparison. Soft, no IS, noticeable chromatic aberration over 230mm. It is better than it's predecessor (the II) but still not a good lens. go for the 55-250 and you won't regret it."
4,Good lens for the price.,This was my second lens purchase as a beginner photographer. It hasn't let me down and use it often.
1,"Very blurry, cannot get a crisp image with this lens","I bought this lens to capture my college graduation from a distance and I am very disappointed in it. The photos are very blurry, even though the camera was on the correct settings. In full daylight, I cannot get a crisp image with this lens no matter what I do.I suppose the old saying holds true: ""You get what you pay for"" except that I didn't get even that much with this purchase."
1,Can also,"I suggest that you buy with usm lens. This lens does not FangDou, pat vision is very easy to fuzzy. I regret that I bought"
1,telephoto zoom lens,"I bought this because the reviews said it was great for taking sports shots at a distance. It takes to long to focus and can only take one picture at a time, which loses the action shot. You cannot take any close range pictures as it cuts everything off. I have to keep changing lenses if I want a team picture or if I want action pictures. Need to find 1 lense to do both jobs."
4,Great!,I have been long over due for adding a new zoom to my camera collection. Love the lense and waiting to see the results of my first shots!
4,Great next step...,"Well, I bought the Digital Rebel, and wanted to start to play around and learn about different lenses. I saw this Canon Zoom lens at $175, and jumped at it. Very happy with it - it really has allowed me to take more types of photos than ever, and it's got me more interested in trying different lenses and photography in general. Good sharp pics (by my eye) and for the price.... great value."
3,the lens...,i have two small-ish scrapes/scratches on the lens. so far it doesn't seem to bother the image yet. but i'm not happy about them.
3,75-300,"Good lens but if yu don't have macro on it, it is not going to help much. You really have to go far away to try to capture something. When is time to use to verticly for a nature picture (as example) you cannot do it, because you have to go far away (verticly)and how to do that? from your second floor?. Pay a little more and get this one with Macro."
2,You get what you pay for,Check out the reviews on web. One of them is at [....] The reviews suggest this lens is of rather poor quality. It may be better than nothing but other Canon lenses do a much better job.
2,Great portrait lens,"I am a non-professional photography enthusiast. I purchased this lens for the specific purpose of shooting indoors at long range without a flash. As long as I lean on something stable, and take my time focusing, I can get maybe 2-3 out of 10 shots in focus. This is due to the lack of an image stabilizer, which is why the price of this lens is very affordable. The same lens with image stabilization runs a couple of hundred bucks more. This lends is great for nature photography in outdoor light (preferable bright) with a tripod, and taking portraits, which I love to do. I am now investing the extra few bucks in another lens with an IMAGE STABILIZER (Canon) for indoor use at long range. If you are looking to shoot sporting events, or indoors at long range in dim light, invest in a lens with image stabilization. Otherwise, this is a light lens that takes fairly clear photos in natural light or indoors with a flash. Love Canon products, and love Amazon!"
4,good lens,"great lens. im new to slr cameras. so i dont know how a real expensive lens is for comparison but i get sharp pictures with this lens, Im using a canon t2i"
4,A grat lens to have in your lens case.,"I'm just a beginner in photography, trying to capture great moments alongside my 18 month old daughter, this lens captures those up close happy girl smiles and laughter from across the room without snapping up the clutter of the dreaded background of a messy room for all to see. Plus it'll work great with my new digital camera that we decided to invest in alongside it seems the rest of the civilized world."
5,best pics i ever took,The best pictures i have ever taken of my kids are with this lens. The best shots are the ones you take when nobodys watching. With this you can get soo close up and not distrub a thing.
4,Disputed Lens - I Like It,"I'm giving this 4 stars because it's pretty much exactly what I expected. A good entry level telephoto lens. I've used this lens both with a tripod and without, and I really haven't had a problem with blurring at the longest focal length - you just need to plant yourself somehow, hold your breath, and think about what you're doing. This is at ISO 400 in full sun. I wouldn't recommend 100 without a tripod.My biggest gripe would be that the manual focus is almost impossible - it grinds hard and forces big jumps. But so far, this hasn't come up.Is this the best lens? No. Is this the best lens for the price? Absolutely. I'd recommend this lens to anyone who wants to add a telephoto to their kit but doesn't want to drop $400. If you've got the bucks, go with the IS. If you don't, this is a very good glass."
4,Great lense on a budget,"I am on a budget college student who picked an expensive hobby! I've been looking for a decent zoom lense for an offordable price for awhile and decided to give this one a shot. I can honestly say that I am not at all disapointed. Although you cant compare it to a $500-700 lense with IS ;look at the price. If you are on budget like me and looking for a decent lense, this one will get the job done. I found that at 300mm it get a little blury if you dont use the tripod, but still this lense give an exceptional images. I love to go to a park and sneak up on birds, very happy with the quality. I hope my experience help some of you. My advice is do a little research because what is good for other people maynot be right for you. Happy shooting!"
4,A Pretty Good Item for it's Price,"Look, most of us are amateur photographers. We usually don't have the bank to get a $5,000 lens or even a fifth of that. But, since we DO want to play with our photo toys and enjoy them - we can def benefit from reasonably priced items like this one. I am able to get some AMAZING sports shots of pitchers with my Canon 300D. If the lighting is low and the object is moving fast, your not going to get the BEST shots, and you'll need a tripod just to get a still image. As long as you know the limits of the lens, its a great value for its price and function"
5,Great zoom,It performs well very well for the price. I use the lense a lot since purchasing it. I love it.
4,Canon EF 75-33mm,I am ajusting and learning how to use this lens and where to use it. For example I wish I would have known to purchase a flash with this lens especially for night time use! This is my inexperience. Because of my inexperience I can not rate this lens appropriately at this time. The pics that I have taken (not at night) are awesome and I am enjoying the learning process.
2,you get what you pay for,I will be returning this lens. Unless you use a tri pod you will not get a clear shot
4,A good lens,Probably not the best lens out there but for the package price I got it for I really like it; the auto focus struggles a bit but manual focus is great.
4,Canon EF 75-300mm Zoom Lens,"I am thrilled with this zoom lens! Since I want high quality wildlife shots, this is perfect for my needs. I have some difficulty with it auto-focusing, but when it does, it is a beautiful shot."
2,Terrible Lens,I hated this lens so much when I was a photo major. I bought this to have a cheap telephoto lens with my camera. I ended up selling it to a friend. This gave me shaky photos on a tripod while using a cable release. It doesn't get much worse than that.
3,ok,"The lens is cheap, that's great because if you take advantage from it, you'll get a great images. But its very demanding, al least you need to use a tripod and good light indeed."
5,Excellent!,"This product is excellent! I received it fast, which added to my pleasure of using it, but I have no complain whatsoever about it, and would recommend it to anybody who does photography."
5,canon EF-75-300 f/4-5.6 111 lens,The lens and price was great! Having fun using it on my rebel camera. It really brings in far away scenes. I'll really enjoy it taking fall pictures.
3,move up one more small notch,"This lens has been around for a while. It's good value for the money, but there's better lens in the Canon line that won't break your bank either.You want to move up to the lens with the same description except for one thing, it will say USM. Those are the motors that autofocus uses. They're quieter and they work better. There are people that cite problems with autofocus. If you're buying this lens, you are probably using it on a body that is more limited in controlling the AF.But buy the other lens for about 30-40 more."
3,Long Focal Length on the Cheap,"Go this along with my Rebel XTi 18-55 kit. Not bad. Great lens for action, sports, or wildlife. You can also create great depth with this one. Wish the aperture would open up to 3 at least. I shot hockey for an assignment and really had a tough time, I got my shots, but I could've gotten more with a larger ap. Will upgrade on this in the next couple years. They make a 70-300 USM with IS that I will replace this with eventually, but for right now, this is nice to have in my case, just in. . . case."
4,Love it!,"Overall I love my new lens. It took some time to get used to the intricacies that using it involved but it took some great pictures of our family trip to Yellowstone. It is slightly heavy and sometimes hard to hold steady, but the final product is good."
3,Good starter.......,"This is a really good starter lens, limited sharpness, but you pay for what you get. For the price, GREAT................"
4,My first telephoto lens,"I just bought my first SLR and quickly realized that I needed a telephoto lens for the type of pictures I want to take. I didn't want to spend a large amount of money on a practice lens and the price for this one was perfect. It's a really decent lens for the price. A tripod is a must when using the maximum zoom (perhaps that is the case with all telephoto lenses?). So far, I've taken some really nice shots with this lens. Overall, I'm pleased with this purchase."
2,not what I expected,"I worked with this lense for about six month now and must admit, its not the quality I would expect from canon. its hard to get sharp pictures as soon as you try to photograph moving objects. pets, kids, outside flowers in the slightest wind, aso ... no chance to get satisfying results.my EF 75-300mm-lense will soon change its owner - and a new lense with IS will be part of my gear."
4,Useful Zoom Lens for Most outdoors events,"I find this to be an overall useful lens to have in my SLR Bag when I am out and about -- going to local events, and even for trial runs at photographing specific projects. Although not fast on the AF mode (it is far better to focus manually when you are photographing Wildlife -- especially Birds) ... it does respond well enough when you are awaiting that 'perfect' moment (you have the patience to wait for -- like with landscapes). This is one lens that I keep in the bag all the time. Eventually ... I'll upgrade to the IS version, but for now .. a good economical alternative to use in the meantime."
3,Written for a Miltary Audience,"This books gives a concise overview of the law of armed conflict as taught and trained in many western militaries. It traces the rationale of the law of armed conflict in holistic manner under the auspices of Just War. The author gives special attention to the concepts of jus ad bellum (right to war) and jus in bellum (right in war). He goes on to give the foundation of where these ideas came from in Western thought from Plato to the Geneva Convention. He goes on to explain how these concepts apply in modern war against non-state actors and terrorists, the use of nuclear weapons as well as well an officer's role in persecuting just war and the role of the United Nations. The intended audience is military students and people involved in defense policy; particularly in the American view. If you want a more in depth study of these concepts, read the primary sources he lists or find a different book."
1,Ethics Lite,"It would be best to skip this book and instead purchase Regan's Just War. While well intended, this volume is merely an overview of the subject and a superficial one, at that."
1,Academic Potboiler,"This is a simple, and simplistic, attempt to review the nature of war as regarded by philosophers and ethicists. It may be that it was written so that the author might offer his students, in an ancient and ignoble practice, an intellectually slim volume as the text for a course. If you need something to lead you to primary sources, this might do. If you want an original take on this subject, or even the hint of perspicacious commentary, look elsewhere."
2,"""Wrong Sized Shoes""","I searched very carefully for a suitable pair of canvas shoes { ""Boat Shoes"" if you like.).I was delighted when they arrived - until I tried to pull them on.I am an English size 8, and these American things certainly are NOT. I should have realised that they would have been different.Postage back to you is prohibitive, so I am lumbered with the darned things.I have never been happy buying stuff from America.Dr. Nigel W.Ashworth."
4,Nifty!,"I like this little radio a lot! Along with my hounds, it's always my close companion when I do carpentry and exterior improvements on this property. I like that it's safety yellow so I can find it easily when it's sitting with tools and supplies (unlike a black radio). I like hand-crank feature so I don't have to run out for new batteries when I'm pinned down on some project. I left it out in the rain one day (Doh!), but it worked just fine afterward.Only minor complaints, and really minor: (1) the antenna is a little flimsy; (2) the SW reception isn't that good."
5,What everyone needs,The product did not require as much effort as others I have used before. The radio runs for better then 20 mins. with just a half minute of cranking and the fine tune adjustment is a big help also. The Grundig FR200 is perfect for the outdoors person and/or those who deal with power outages.
4,Good Overall,"Could be built a little sturdier, but a good overall product. A little tricky to learn to tune at first, but pleased with my purchase."
2,Only for AM/FM,"The AM and FM parts of this radio work adequately, although the sound is very tinny. The shortwave does not pick up anything but static in an urban environment."
3,"Great Idea, but Crank stopped working","Still OK on batteries and very efficient, but lasts only a few seconds on the human power."
2,Don't expect much,"I have the FR-200 which I purchased through Amazon.Don't expect much.The antenna will break and when you try to buy a replacement you will not be able to use Eton's web site to do it becuase it does not work.When you call Eton on the phone they will tell you that the antenna is ""back ordered"" and you should call in about 45 days.More crap from China."
5,Great Pproduct,I purchased the Grundig radio for my husband. He loved it. He plays with it like a kid in a toy store. It was a great gift and the right gift for him.
5,Nice Emergency radio,I found the radio had very good reception. It also charges very quickly with the turn handle which at first seems a bit tight but charges the radio faster than others I have tried. The light is very bright and can be seen for quite a distance which I found out when I had it turned on at our camp outside and actually had to turn it off because it was too bright. It has become my camp/emergency radio.
4,great product,"It's a lot smaller than I expected, but that is a good thing. The charge lasts surprisingly long and the reception is excellent. It should come in very handy if the power goes out."
4,Emergency radio,"The Grundig FR200 is a highly useful item to have around the house - a small insurance policy against the moment when natural or Man generated disaster threatens or strikes, you need to know what is going on and power systems are down. The hand crank guarantees access whether you have batteries in the house or not. As to voice quality: The Grundig has reasonably good sound quality and makes for agreeable listening in untroubled times."
5,Tried and tested during Hurricane Ike,"I've had the Metallic Blue Grundig FR200 radio since 2006, as part of our Hurricane Preparedness Kit. I live in Houston, and finally got to test this emergency radio when Hurricane Ike hit 11 days ago. Still have no power at home, but this radio has great reception; the LED lamp is bright and illuminates our family room. Running on AA batteries, it keeps us abreast with what's going on the past 11 days."
4,Simply a must for emergencies,"It does what it says and if your looking for a good emergency radio, this is it. I have two for emergencies and everything I have tested on it works just fine."
3,Good but not great,"The reception is strong and clear on AM and FM, but virtually non-existent on shortwave. That's fine, because I didn't plan to use the shortwave feature anyway. Build quality is average.The dynamo crank is cheap and I suspect it will break at some point. Following directions EXACTLY (90 seconds vigorous cranking, no flashlight, low volume), I was able to achieve between 20 - 30 minutes of use time. Nowhere near the 40 - 60 minutes specified.I got mine on Ebay for $27.95. That's about what it's worth. It will go into my emergency kit and who knows, maybe someday I'll be glad I have it."
3,Color,"We have a few FR200's and have no complaints about the radio itself - for the price it's excellent. However, when I purchased the ""Yellow"" radio, I received an Orange radio instead (which I haven't found listed anywhere). Even the Amazon product detail section shows 2 distinctly different colors - Yellow and Orange. Don't know what's up but Orange is not Yellow."
5,Emergency radio,This radio is great. The reception is crisp and the light is strong -- a necessity when it is the only light source.
5,A great emergency radio,"Have you been caught without power and no batteries for your portable radio? This crank-up radio will give you all the emergency information you need while hiding in the basement - or on a camping trip! It is well designed, with the antenna and wind-up crank fitting close to the body of the radio when not in use. An excellent item to add to anyone's home!"
5,A must have for your safety,This is the type of gift or personal item that is so important. Just buy them for the people you care about. Unfortunately we don't always remember to stock on the emergency supplies. This is a great product.
1,I got a dud!,"I'm very disappointed. This item died in the box itself. Neither the light works, nor the radio (any band), either off the built in dynamo, or the optional alkaline cells. The only thing that shows signs of life is the charging lamp, which lights up on the dynamo being cranked.This item was gifted to me, and now I learn that Grundig/Eton do not have any service centers in India, or even Asia. So I will have to try and repair the thing, if possible, shipping it back to avail of the ""guarantee"" not really being much of an option.As I said, I'm pretty disappointed."
3,crank radio,I was not totally impressed with this radio. It is staticky. havent really put it to the test yet in a power outage so it should be okay.I did see it elsewhere for $10 less.
5,Emergency Radio,"This radio is sold under several brands, and is good for daily use as well as for emergencies because it picks up signals from a longer distance than most radios. The wind-up feature is more fun than utilitarian since three AA batteries will power this little gadget for days. I am put out that the radio did not come with an AC adaptor, and I refuse to buy one at the high prices now charged for them. I think Radio Shack started this consumer-unfriendly trend of selling incomplete products, and Microsoft does the same through its Vista non-ware."
1,Who are the interpreters?,"I'm all for sensuosness, and particularly for sensuous baroque music but, how can I buy a cd without knowing who the interpreters are? The previous reviewers do not enlighten us punters any further. In fact, both reviews are fairly vague and unspecific. I think I'll give this one a miss."
1,Incorrect information in Baby Names around the World,"In the lists of names from Scandinavia, Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Iceland about halv of the names are not first names. Many ""names"" are unknown as names and words at all. There are a lot of surnames. Ola is not a girl's name, but a boy's, and Bodil, Inger, Mette and Valborg is not a boy's name. Kari is not a typical Danish name,but a Norwegian. Also some misspellings.For other languages I find that Charles is German, that Che is Spanish for José, Ivar is a variant of Ivor og Ivo, Yves is a French form of Ivar. Van (p. 381) and Von (p. 383) are short forms of first names. Mac is a Scottish first names for boys. All this do no correspond to my information from other sources. In the lists of German, French and Spanish first names there are a lot of surnames. But may be all the surnames in the English-list also is used at first names for boys?"
3,Later day Limeliters,This is 1982 Limeliters without Glenn Yarbrough. Some of the classic Limeliters songs are different because of this cast change. I prefer the earlier versions but these are pretty good.
3,Good collection of songs not on their regular albums.,"This is actually a good collection of songs not used on any of Asia's regular albums. I can't believe the quality of some of them. I would've thought that they would have been on the regular albums and not on a collection of unused songs. ""Moon Under the Water"" is a great song with some great keyboard playing from Geoff Downes. ""Don't Come to Me"" is a great song and one of Asia's best. ""Obsession"" is good. The album ending instrumental ""Armenia"" is great. Archiva Vol. 2 is much better than the first Archiva volume. Worth a listen, there are some great songs on here."
3,Grade C,"Asia's second volume of Archiva is not near as good as the first one. Vol. 1 had a lot more songs that were good and only a couple that were bad. Vol 2 has 3 good songs OBSESSION, RIGHT TO CRY & MOON UNDER WATER. Rest of the songs are average or below. Production this time seems rushed, and a lot of the song do not have the Asia feel to them. Big complaint is that this time you can see the cover, BUT it's the same cover as Vol 1, juet with Vol 2 on it instead."
1,yech,This book was terrible. By far one of the worst books I've ever read. The story is bland and he manages to make even the greatest tales of arthur boring.
3,"""You squashed my favorite Beatle!""","""The Chase"" has to be one of the strangest Who adventures ever! It almost seems to be a variation of ""The Keys of Marinus"", with six unconnecting episodes of the TARDIS crew being ""Chased"" throughout the Universe and Time. It's very silly, but at the same time extremely enjoyable. The Daleks themselves come off very well(nice to see the intro to the Supreme Dalek). Peter Purves play a great American tourist, and even better as Steven. The Haunted House episode is the nadir of the adventure, and Maureen O'Brien proves that she might be worse than Dodo(she is given some of the worst lines and the worst deliveries in this story). Hartnell is excellent as he shows his emotions when Ian and Barbara decide to leave. There is posssibly the silliest Dalek line in this one:""Am Totally Immobilised!"" And as for the Mechanoids......"
4,Really good,I had heard the cut I'll fly with you on the radio mixed with the last cut.. blah blah... and I fell in love with the beat. I decided to use it to write my new novel. The beat carried alot of intrique with it. But unfortunately the CD mix was not like the radio. I was disappointed but not dismayed. It was still worth my money and I can work with the music. The cuts are all different enough. I once went to a rave..watched the door..hehe. And all the songs were the same. I couldnt' tell where one trance left off and another began. But this CD was different. I could hear the smooth transistions and it was a great listening experience.
3,"A good, but thin, primer","Virtual Music is a solid primer, an introduction really, to how music came to be put on the web as a discrete medium. He begins with a brief history of the development of the type of ideas needed to make the conceptual leap to technology, then describes how particular artists, including himself, made music that is specifically for the medium of the web. The accompanying CD has examples of all the music discussed.What the book is not, however, is any kind of set of instructions for how to make music for the web. Duckworth is very specific in not touching on this topic - that's up to the musician. That's not a fault, but a focus. However, the book is rather thin, there is much more history to describe, and much more discussion about each topic. The writing is serviceable, nothing more. This is an important part of contemporary music history, and Virtual Music competently lays the foundation for filling that gap."
1,Dont make the mistake of watching this trash,"What a horrible waste of time. Even for a low-budget film, it was terrible.Worse acting than you would find in a high school drama class."
3,Works well but be mindful of Senna,"I had been diagnosed with IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome) many years ago, but had not had any symptoms in over a year. After beginning a new diet (and getting constipated from said diet) I tried this tea before bed. The next day I awoke with crippling stomach/intestinal cramping and diarrhea. It lasted for several hours the next morning. This reaction, apparently, is fairly typical for people highly reactive to Senna, a main ingredient in the tea which gives it the laxative quality. For those without this reaction the tea does wonders, but be weary if you have regular diarrhea or have been diagnosed with any intestinal problem/illness including IBS, diverticulitis, or intestinal inflammation. It will clean out your intestines, but it will do so quite painfully."
2,Cramping,"I have a sensitive stomach. The first time I tried this was around 4pm. It took 6hours before it kicked in but once it did, I was up all night. The cramps were so bad I swore I would never use it again. I took loperamide to ease the discomfort and frequent trips to the potty."
1,NASTY!,"I just drank the tea. It smells and taste nasty. I tried my hardest not to throw up, thinking this is normal. But, I did end up throwing up everything. My head is still spinning, I do not know if I am having an allergic reaction to the tea. But I know that I do not recommend this nor will I ever take it again. I am so sick right now."
5,Rage of 1710 -- Music that inspires your soul,This is the best collection of classical music from that period that I've found. They are well knows pieces that touch the very heart of anyone that cares to listen even if not a classical music fan. You will love it. Hard to find and well worth purchasing as you will play it all the time. Beautifully done with instrumentation from that time period.
2,Wrongly labeled,"I love this product, but it's not 2.8 oz. and always gets taken away by airport security staff. The long, thin can also makes it difficult to put into a quart plastic bag. And finally, the nozzle clogs and there's no way to clear it. Hot water and safety pins do nothing."
5,"What Goes Around, Comes Around!!!","What happens to a husband, who has taken his wife for granted for soo long? The answer lies within the pages of this book by Mr. RM Johnson. I love stories where the main character, who thinks he has it going on soo well that he forgets the one person who has stood by his side throughout. Nate, the main character and the millionaire (hence the title), who is married to Monica, a wife that has been his friend, his lover, and confident. However, when Nate finds out that Monica cannot bear his children, he no longer wants to be married anymore (can you believe that?).Therefore, he devises a plan to hook Monica up,(yes, I said hookup-that's what it is)so that she will commit adultery and leave him in peace with all of his millions. You know the plan won't work as planned, there wouldn't be a story, a story with many twist that will keep you wanting to read more and more until you finally get to the end."
4,Pacing myself,"I have read a couple of R.M. Johnson's books and have enjoyed them and so far, this one is no exception!! I can usually finish a book in less than 48 hrs, but I am trying to pace myself. I am only on chapter 36 and I can't wait to see what happens to Nate. I can't believe the methods he is going thru to divorce his wife to keep his money and divorce his wife. I feel sorry for Lewis. I won't give away anymore, but I will say this...you will not be disappointed in this book!!"
4,You go boy!,What some people will do to stroke their egos. Both husband and wife were at fault and need to just start their lives with each other all over again without the games.
4,Games People Play,"This was one of our first reads from our newly established bookclub. We thought it started out slow but picked up and kept you going. It was an interesting plot. The message we received from it was that when you're in a marriage/relationship, you can't play games with people's hearts and minds because it will backfire on you. Just be straight-up and let the dominoes fall where they may. Players get played and haters get dissed.AFTERWORDS BOOKCLUBDenver, Colorado Chapter"
4,GOOD READ!!,"When I first saw this book, the title did not catch my eye and when I read the jacket I was not interested, thought it was predictable. A friend recommended it to me and was glad. It was a really good read and I enjoyed it. I will be giving his other books a chance."
3,O-Okay,"This book wasn't all its cracked up to be.I mean Nate is a succesful businessman who wants a family but later finds out that his wife can't have kids.She lies to him about being pregnant because she knew how bad he wanted kids.He comes up with a trifling scheme.Nate is selfish and even though his wife lied he had a hard time forgiving her.Marriage is suppose to be for better or worse but Nate's character...at first I felt sorry for him but the more I read about him the more I felt sorry for Monica,his wife.Overall it was an ok read."
3,Page Turner,"This book was pretty predictable, a little unbelievable, but had a good plot. If you want a easy read, I recommend."
4,Be careful what you ask for!,Plot: Pretty decent!Rising Action: Unrealistic!Climax: Highly Unlikely!Conclusion: Makes you want more;*)~
2,Read this if you don't expect much from the books you read,"I have liked RM Johnson since his early books featuring the Harris men.This book, requires a person to suspend disbelief.A faithful woman, suddenly after ONLY 1 week of no sex, just has to have it with a guy she just met?Nobody ever mentions the possibility of a surrogate? These are wealthy educated people?Thats exactly whats wrong with this book. Anything that might subtract from the fantasy storyline, the writer just ignores it. Hopes his reader doesn't expect logic or reasonable storylines.I still bought the sequel to this, again based ON RM Johnson's past performance. That book is even worse!!"
1,An Insult to Any True Reader's Intelligence,This has got to be the most juvenile book I have ever read! The story line was utter foolishness. The plot was absurb and I can't believe he had the nerve to write an epilogue at the close of the romp!! Bad with a capital 'b'! There is probably not one word that has more than 2 syllables and he attempts to give the main character educational credibility by assiging her an MBA....but she works as a manager in a men's clothing store. Who gets an MBA and works in a clothing store??? The male main character has to be the most asinine depiction of a husband. When hs wife can't have a baby he paints the nursery black...dumb dumb dumb!
3,"easy read, but.....","I've had this book for several months but finally had time to read over vacation. It was an easy read but some points are not quite believable. For instance, this educated Sistah, married to a millionaire and worked in a retail store (why?), slept with a Brotha and didn't know exactly where he worked or how he `really' made his money (ya'll know how nosy we sistahs are).. AND don't you think she would have remembered what was in the pre-nup and not put all that in jeopardy! And finally, leave one lying man and go to another lying man, with a drug addict/ hoe for a baby mamma... hecky naw!"
2,What? Huh?,"Sorry, but I could not connect with the voice. The title and cover piqued my interest, so I bought the book, but the writing is sooooo simplistic and amateurish. Where were the metaphors?I expected to hear the voice of an established 40 -plus seasoned man/female, but instead I felt Iike I was reading a young adult book.2 stars one for the title and one for the cover."
4,Very Good 1st Book,I have to say that RM Johnson knew what to do in writing this book. You think you know what is going to happen but then you don't and it just keeps you wanting to read more. I'm still waiting to see if there will be a part 2.
2,Boring,"This book isn't holding my interest, nothing different from any other fairytale, drama written book. Not Happy, Not a page turner, and I would like a refund."
4,Great Read!!!,"I absolutely loved this book!!! The characters of Nate, Monica, and Lewis were very well-developed. The book had everything: sex, love, and betrayal all intertwined in a well-developed plot. The mark of a good read for me is when I don't see the cliff hanger and ending a mile away. ""Million Dollar Divorce"" had me guessing and intrigued until the very end.I would have rated this book ""5 stars"", and hence my only criticism is that the author, RM Johnson, should have researched the field of female infertility more. There was one sure-fire option for Nate and Monica to have a child (i.e. a donor egg) that the author does not treat. Of course, this is a technical detail and I enjoyed the book just the same.This was the first RM Johnson novel that I read, but it will not be the last!!!"
4,Great Read!,Just as I titled this review this is a great read. This book made we want to read again. If want a page turner look no further. This is the first book that I have read by this author and now that I have found him I will make sure he stays within my radar. The reason this book is so good is because the characters just jump off the page....You know them...You feel them...they were very well developed. The leading lady Monica wasn't perfect by any means but you still felt sorry for her. This book allows you to get in the heads of these characters as they fall in love and seek revenge. Looks like there might be a part two in the future....I certainly hope so as it took me weeks to get these people off my mind....Great Read!
3,Easy read...,"The book was an easy read, I read it in short time. Money, greed, selfishness, the overwhelming themes all came to the forefront in the end...and the ending was a bit predictable...I am in a book club, so book discussion guide questions would be a neat idea for the author to include in future books or on his website."
3,Not all that,"Wow...i just finished this book and I am glad that I finally did. It tooke alomst 3 weeks to do it and ill be happy to just to pack it away. I really dont know what more to say about that story was just not that good to me, The only person I had any amount of respect for was Lewis,Nate was a monster and I just found Monica to be pathetic. I will still read his other books though because The Harris men and Harris Family were excellent reads."
3,"Strong New York flavor, spicy characters, weak plot...","Denis Hamill writes excellent New York scenery and gives his supporting characters plenty of juice. Bobby Emmet is an effective protagonist, but suffers from the ""Superman Syndrome"": the toughest hombre on the block, the last honest cop in the corrupt city, the man every woman wants (including his ex-wife...give me a break). Denis, give this guy a handicap, get him hooked on some painkillers or something. Fast paced, but the plot has holes in it you could fit Dennis Franz through. I haven't read ""Throwing 7's"" yet, but I will. I think Denis Hamill's best stuff is yet to come."
2,Movie of the week,although it was interesting and fairly well written I thought the ending was an absolute cheat. It was almost as if the author was tired of the whole thing and just wanted to end it as quickly as possible.As I read the book I could just about imagine who he had in mind to play which character in the movie. Too bad...this could have been so much better.
2,Not bad - a pretty good story but too many flaws.,"The storyline for this novel has potential, however, I wasn't thrilled by the way it was delivered. The dialogue contains cliches and ""clever"" one-liners - I felt that the basic story was intriguing enough to deserve better dialogue. The revelation of the originator of the three-quarters scam was utterly predictable, as were many of the plot twists. Bobby's daughter, Maggie, was a sweet addition, but completely unbelievable as an adolescent computer hacker. No one could be that intuitive and well-adjusted. It was somewhat difficult to keep track of the ancillary characters thrown in here and there, for what seemed to be an effort to lend depth to the pension scam. These underdeveloped characters only succeeded in providing additional opportunity for sometimes tiresome vulgarity. It's unfortunate that the predictable plot and weak dialogue tarnished what could have been a fun mystery novel."
1,"Smash, Bang and KaBoom","In a world torn apart by the detonation of a nuclear device above Seattle, Jessica Alba stars as Max a genetically engineered Super Hot Soldier on the run from her maker. Clad in black tight fitting clothes this ""Dark Angel"" embarks on missions assigned to her by her mentor and cyber tech terrorist buddy against the opressive and corrupt government. Oh and by the way did I mention he wears glasses and is in a wheel chair?Action packed, full of explosions and breaking glass, plus a bonus ""mad at the world"" black lesbian, this show will have you recongnizing every genre cliche you've ever seen.For you own well being. Avoid!"
3,Dark Angel - Season 1,"Due to my mistake I purchased this DVD believing that I would be able to view it on my DVD Player which wasn't the case due to Region Codes. Apart from that I received the products quickly, they were cheap and it was nice to re-watch Dark Angel as I was a fan when it was on tv."
2,it had 2 cracked discs,I love the show but doesn't matter if i can't watch it. The first two discs don't play. I know it wasn't on purpuse
4,Still Surprisingly Watchable,"When I bought these DVDs recently, I wasn't sure if I would like the series as much as I did when I watched it on television. Happily, I still think it's smart, funny, and thrilling. The characters are very likable, and it doesn't hurt that they are also very attractive. The stories are very exciting and make you want to keep watching episode after episode.A few of the lines are a little dated, of course, but that's reasonable, I think, and there's not so many of them that you notice. In all, an excellent sci-fi series that sadly died before its time, just like its successor, Joss Whedon's ""Firefly."" Thanks again, FOX."
5,A hopeful Customer,"I loved the Dark Angel TV series, it was an awesome show. I found it very discouraging when I heard there wasn't going to be a third season. I hope that this DVD will become availible soon. I would greatly advise that the person who reads this review next will make a review of their own."
1,Great Viewing!,"Even if you are not a big sci-fi fan, you will still enjoy Dark Angel-The Complete First Season. Besides having an impressive plot concept, the first season of the show gave us a look at some interesting personal interaction between believable characters. I liked the second season for the way it developed the story line, but the first season was better done over all. Whether or not you like science fiction, you will get hours of enjoyment out of this box set of the first season of Dark Angel."
3,"Too little, too late","I loved the show when it aired. It's just ""stale"" now, with too many episodes dragging on and on...yet too much happening in others. More time should have been spent on the little things in the movie that were soooo interesting (the betting, the money, the bar tricks, the lifestyle) There was no good pace for the show, but for a discounted price, this isn't bad. I already have a 'copy' but would probably buy at this discount. I'd love to see the special features (Commentary is the only one?) but 2.0 surround...yuck.3 stars for not being released until 2005, 2.0 audio, and nothing extra except commentary on the pilot."
5,Dark Angel Series on DVD,"Dark Angel has been a hit since the series premiered on primetime tv. My family and I have been watching it and except for a few scenes in some episodes, i think it's a series everyone regardless of age can watch.The DVD of Dark Angel is naturally true to the show and should be watched by everyone. I love watching again and again each scene and episode of Dark Angel. Teh DVD is definitely a surefire way to get Dark Angel particularly after the show has been cancelled.While we're all hoping for the network to bring back the series, we can tide ourselves over this loss, which we all hope will be temporary, until the network brings back this great show. It's the tv-series worth more than its production cost and the DVDs are to be treasured. We surely got more than our money's worth."
3,South African Dark Angel Fan,"Dark Angel is an excellent series - it fascinates me that FOX has cancelled it. Why on earth??? Surely its bringing in money, because the fan base is huge, and international. In South Africa, I watched every single episode until I left (mid-way series 2), and now that I'm in the UK, I'm desperately trying to buy the DVD, but no-one has heard of it! (Poor lost souls).Dark Angel rocks, and there better be some underground plan for the fans to find out what actually happens between Max and Logan after ""Freak Nation""!"
4,"Dark Angel , very satisfied","I was very satisfied with the first season of dark angel that I purchased. I liked the fact that the whole concept of the genetically generated characters made the possibilities of what they were capable of doing and becoming endless. The acting was good and the Sci-Fi was as advertised. I quickly followed that purchase up with season two. In all that I have seen Jessica Alba in, I liked her in this the most."
5,Need Dark Angel DVD!!,"I love Dark Angel, and was very mad when it was cancelled!!!So i and all of the fans very much need and want this DVD!Please release it, the show is wonderful. I love it how it takes place in 2020 and that Max, Alec, Zack and the others are genitically engineered. It is so original and interesting!"
2,"This ain't ""Alias""","Having becomed addicted to ""Alias"" after viewing the first 2 DVD sets, I decided to try this. What a disappointment. The acting is merely passable -- usually flat -- the dialogue is peppered with cliche urban expressions (What's the dealio?!), and each 45 minute episode ends with a tired moral. My greatest disappointment? That I lost the receipt for the second season set and can't return it."
1,I want to like this show..,"Jessica Alba was doing grl power way before Jennifer Garner and she is cuter, post apocapyptic Sci Fi should be a slamdunk and wow - 6 DVD's in Season 1 so you can't say they didnt get a chance to get this right - BUT, i just can't get into it, is it the acting, the narrative, the basic premise of the show? beats me, but its missing pretty much everything that makes for a good dramatic or comedic series, and it does try to do both. If I could draw one parallel from the cinema, its Tank Girl - its got a modicum of style, a painfully offbeat demeanor, no substance and a grandiose vision, but Tankgirl was over in a couple of hours - did i mention Season 1 was on 6 discs? I wish Jessica lots of luck whatever she's doing right now because she is talented but this was not a good showcase for her and if you listen to the director's commentary you will conclude that talent was not overabudnant at every level of Dark Angel."
3,Could have been better.,"I had high hopes for this show. The premise was great, they chose an actress who personifies Max in Jessica Alba, and they had a great storyline with Manticore. But damn, the supporting cast was terrible. Apart from Logan, everyone else was boring and useless. This show had so much potential and it shows because the fans who started watching it at first got bored and eventually the show was cancelled due to bad ratings."
1,Deserved Cancellation,"Awful and stupid junk about a supergirl and her wheelchair bound boyfriend (THAT sure was clever!). Alba can't act out of a paper bag, and the writing is cheesier than a Lifetime made-for-TV movie. Stupid junk, undeserving DVD release."
1,Appealed To The Ghetto Fab (and Their sad Wannabes),"Fox Network in all of its devilish ways puts tacky bits of sleaze such as this series on its network while it cries about the lack of morality that shows like this present in Amrika on its Fox News Channel.This show was silly and was meant to appeal mostly to those same people who've drove down the stock value of Cristal just by praising that brand.Jessica Alba is one very overrated nontalented nonactress. She's cute as far as that breed of urban American latina goes (and this is saying much for the girl).Show also made fun of white women once when Alba's black friend said to her ""Let's get out of here, there're too many flatassed white girls.""Can you imagine if Buffy said to her friends or the girls from ""Sex & the City"" said to each other... ""Let's get out of here, there are too many fat & mean black girls here""?There would be an uproar!"
2,Dark Angel IS A ...,This show is nothing but a bad ... of a far superior show - BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER. The writers of this show don't even come close to giving Dark Angels audience the kind of excellence that Buffy's writers produce. Don't buy this ... go out and buy one of the 3 Buffy seasons that are out on DVD so far they are superior products.
1,Why?,It is not fair that this t.v series has already been out on DVD and it was on way AFTER Charmed!!! This show [stinks]! Charmed should be out on DVD instead. I don't recommend this DVD at all!
5,SHA-BAM!,"I loved Dark Amgel, so it only made sense to buy the action packed DVD! After being deprived of Dark Angel for so long, i didnt realize how much i loved it. It absolutely blew me away!!"
5,Answer: none more country,"There is nothing at all wrong with chronicling a man's decent into madness. That is a classic story line for many a great country song and Dale Watson just happens to know what it's like to dance on the other side of the dance floor. Not many people do.To paraphrase the sage Redd Foxx ""I feel sorry for people who don't drink, do drugs or go crazy. Because someday they're going to be in a hospital bed, dying, and they won't know why."" Years from now, when Dale looks back, he won't have that problem. He might have just lived the greatest country song."
5,Thank you Dale,"Not many people are able to share such personal experiences, so eloquently. This film draws you in and leads you on a journey. It has you asking the very same questions about your own thoughts and beliefs."
4,Crazy Good.,"Dale Watson's brutal honesty about what must be the black hole of dark moments in his life is what makes this film worth watching. Not many people have the fortitude to display themselves as openly and nakedly as this Texas music man does. Zalman King does a nice job of letting the story unfold naturally and quietly building to Mr. Watson's most jaw-dropping revelations. If you are interested in the intersections of trauma, art, country music, and love, this is a must see."
1,High sounding but hollow.,"All Sound and Fury, SIGNIFYING NOTHING. A concotion of various Indian philosophies with a bad self induced, shortsighted vision."
1,ex brahma kumar,Dadi Janki is in fact a horrible women whom I've known well for a number of years. She enjoys hero worship and believes everyone deserves to die a horrid death as a result of their ignorance unless they are a part of her organisation that are enlightened.This book is just a cynical recruitment drive to get more members for her cult in which you will be stripped of all your worldy possesions(money).Please avoid and dheed the warnings of someone who's life was ruined by these people.
5,Great Gift for everyone,"After reading this book I start giving as a gift to friends and relatives included some close patients from my office where I practice Dentistry but also have a good relationship with them. I have been found they are very thanks to me especially if they are having any problem concerned to a relative close to death that they have to face and help. Thanks to the book I get thanks from them. Dr. Claudia Rangel,D.D.S"
4,This book was my favorite birthday present,"Well, I had read the author's other book Companion of God, and then never came across another book by her. My father knew this, and surprised me with this one. It is just as good, though I like the drawings in the other one better. The chapter on Humility was amazing - what she said was so different than anything others have said, how it is a source of strength and safety and freedom from the influence of others. I have given it to several friends who have read many ""new age"" books and they felt it was more authentic and uplifting than most. I hope she keeps writing...!"
2,Opportunity missed!,"Pity that Randy made a real mess of this music!Foster wrote such wonderfully melodic songs, so why does Randy think he can improve on the melodies, as he tried with Old folks at Home, and others?And that backing! it was more suited to the jungle, than the South - with those rhythms, bongos and pan pipes.Foster fans will need to keep looking, I'm afraid.But Vanwarmer fan will probably be happy, as the sound is excellent and it is a nicely produced Japanese CD."
1,Zumdahl and the Chemistry of Money-Making,"Every day, I see Steven Zumdahl wearing a pricy Italian suit to class. While other professors choose to be more discreet, Mr. Zumdahl prefers to live the Hollywood lifestyle. And the funny thing is, he can. His subpar chemistry book is purposefully filled with errors each and every edition for the sole purpose of cranking out a new edition in a couple of years. For, Mr. Zumdahl is a smart man. He knows that a new edition means buying new books at a price ranging in the 90-100 dollar range, which, in turn, means more profit for the Chemistry money-making machine. Why not buy a decent Chemistry book written by somebody who is concerned with helping people learn Chemistry rather than looking sharp in his Armani suits."
5,Fast delivery!,Book arrived quickly just in time for my son to have it for school! Great condition! Nice to be able to find textbooks for inexpensive prices!
2,No thanks to you!!,"In college, professors expect students to learn on their own, so the students basically rely on their books. At Penn State, there is a 60% failure rate for people who take an introductory Organic Chemistry class. I wonder why?? Because they use this book!! I flunked Chemistry, no thanks to this book!! They should make better ones."
1,Chemistry,I have not received this book! I am quite disappointed in the length of time for delivery. It was ordered over 5 weeks ago.
2,VAMPIRE COSTUME VERY CHEAPLY MADE,"I bought this for my grandson as a Christmas gift because he likes to play dress-up. For the price I paid, it was cheaply made and not much to it."
3,pretty but knotted on arival,"Its a nice necklace, it was really knotted up on arival as the other reviewer stated, so I wasn't surprised. The stones hang a little off-center, but doubled it looks ok. Stones are beautiful though."
2,"Pretty, but!!","The necklace arrived today. It may turn out to be rather pretty, if I am ever able to get untangled. It arrived in a mixed up ball. Amazon did a poor job of quality control. It is so bad that I'm not sure it wasn't done on purpose."
4,swiss diamond cookware,"I've had a set of Swiss Diamond Cookware for nearly a year. I love this cookware! It cooks evenly and is extemely easy to clean using a Dobie or a soft soapy brush. I sometimes use a little butter, for flavor, but have successfully fried eggs without butter and they never stick to the pan. I never use cooking spray, always use non-metal utensils, and cook only at medium or lower heat levels, as suggested by the company, and have not experienced any pilling or scratching of the cooking surfaces. My only complaint is the slight singing of the stainless backs, even with all the precautions mentioned and which even Barkeeper's Friend (and alot of elbow grease) can not remove. I hang my pans and would love for the backs to remain as beautiful as they were out of the wrapping. I agree that they are quite pricy but thus far, I have found them worth the price."
2,Swiss Diamond sautee pan,"We spent a lot of money ($150) on the 12-inch sautee pan which is advertised as ""virtally indestructable"". We have been very careful with the pan. We don't use metal utensils, put it in the dishwasher, or use abrasive cleaners or scrubbers. The non-stick coating is pitting, flaking and coming off after only eight months.The company told me that we could send it back (at our expense) and someone at the company would examine the pan and decide if they would repair the pan, give us a replacement or return the pan as is.We are planning to return the pan, but we aren't too hopeful.Having recently read quite a few reviews of other companies' non-stick cookware, it seems that this is a common problem. Caveat emptor!"
2,nothing to see here....move along.,"Don't waste your time or money. I have had this for 3.5 years, and it needs replacing. they do scratch! in fact, I think they scratch easier than my old Tfal which I replaced. I would also say that the nonstick is no better than any other I have tried, in fact, I think it is worse. I had my Tfal for 10 years and the Swiss diamond needs replacing after only 3. After reading the reviews here I am not even going to try to get them replaced. they are going in the garage sale next week for $20. the pans themselves are not weighted well either. the small pot will fall over sometimes when it is empty. If i buy a nonstick set in the future, I will get decent Tfal set for under $100 and replace it every 3-5 years."
3,no so indestructable,nice pans intially but they will show normal wear and tear and they do scratch even if you don't use metal utensils.
3,Lasted a long time but not forever.,"I was in shock when my husband first ordered an 11.5 inch Swiss Diamond non-stick fry pan. It was quite expensive. But then I used it and was really impressed. It worked great for several years. I was so pleased with it that I bought one for my neice as a wedding shower gift, and raved to all my relatives about how it was worth the extra expense. Shortly thereafter, ours started sticking. I washed it well, and it was OK for one or two uses. But it has gotten progressively worse. Now it may work OK---if I wash it very well, then heat the oil in it to quite hot (not quite smoking) before adding the food. It does not appear to be stained and is not flaking or particularly scratched. So I don't know why it has become so sticky. I am debating whether to invest in a new one or not."
1,My set started scratching after a year,I am throwing my set away after 3 years. My family and I were very careful with the set; we always washed the pot and pans by hand. The set is not worth the money.
1,pan scratches!,"I paid $141 for a large Swiss Diamond nonstick pan and in about a year the bottom was breaking off. Pretty bad. I switched to All-Clad, and there are other high quality steel or steel-copper pans out there. I will never buy nonstick again."
1,Save your money!.,I am very unhappy with this cookware and I'm glad I saved my Magnalite that I've had for 20+ years ago. The 2 sauce pans are really too small not balanced and especially on a gas range you need to be very careful with them. The stock pot is huge and other 2 pans which come with the set are odd shaped and I rarely use them. When we purchased this set we were told we didn't need to use any oil for the fry pans...not true-if you don't the items stick to the pan! I also agree with some of the other reviews regarding the scratching and for the price the finish does not hold up.[[ASIN:B0006GAID2 Swiss Diamond Cast-Aluminum Nonstick 10-Piece Cookware Set
5,Swiss Diamond cookware,"I purchased Swiss Diamond cookware 2yrs. ago after reading consumers report. I love them. I have the entire set plus many extra pieces. They are easy to clean and easy to care for. I do not put them in the dish washer nor do I use metal utensils. A quick wash in warm soapy water does the trick. I have a 12"" frying pan that I use the most and found that after about every 6-7th washing it needs to be re seasoned with a little oil after washing taking less then 30sec. If used as directed and with a little loving care they do make life easier for cooking and cleaning. I also stack then in the cabinets using a paper towel in between to prevent scratching. Anything worth paying that amount of money for is worth caring for."
5,ExOfficio's Game On Kayak Fishing,The footage captured for this video on Kayak fishing is exceptional and inspiring. My 9 year old and I watched this video and now we both want to own a Kayak and fish from it whenever possible. The areas where one can fish and the closeness to nature that can be achieved in a Kayak is unmatched by any other watercraft...this video is cool and needs to be a part of any library where outdoor activities are a focus.
5,one of the best albums of the decade,"incredible song writing, fresh, great vocal's and harmony's...who are they and why aren't they all over the radio? I am so excited to hear more from this amazing group!"
5,Just Ain't Right,the song is beautiful. i love the lyrics and the original style. and the fact that the singers are fine as crazy doesn't hurt one bit. i wish the group on point much success in both life and music.
5,On-Point RULES!,"They are so great and i waited in line at the mall with my friends for so long just to see them, they are so cool, and Moes the best because he likes Macaroni and Chesse!"
1,Supreme Disappointment,"I had listened to a handful of early (or earlier) Herbert tracks and remixes through other artists and was really interested experiencing the rest of his music. I'll admit I was expecting more of the same (subtle house meets jazz with great micro sampling). Unfortunately, this record is a pretentious mess. The lyrics are grating and the music is ridiculous. If I had to label it that label would be ""showtune hell"". Bodily Functions is masterpiece compared to this. There can be no doubting the man's talent, but this is a definite ""what was he thinking?"" record. I discarded the disk. It is THAT irritating."
2,Sextronica,"Mildly cooked electronica experimenter has some sleek and sexy ideas going for it, which when executed properly can evoke (or rip off) anything from Prince to Air. Much more often however, a vacant, narcissistic pretentiousness lingers, as Herbert struggles to make these semi-unique programmed pieces fit convincingly amidst overproduced, underwritten clutter."
4,Interesting and good,"i would give it 5 to show that its really good but 5 stars should be reserved for 'the best.' so this is really good but obviously not the best, which for me is something by deerhoof or radiohead.....anyways as for this album.....well im a big alternative rock/indie fan and so were the rest of my friends except now they've suddenly all gotten into rap. i went searching for some beat driven stuff of my own and ive kinda gotten more into electronica and things like Four Tet, DJ Shadow, The Avalanches, and M83. This album by Herbert got a good review on PitchforkMedia too, so i wanted to check it out.its very very interesting. it has some cool beats to it and a nice dance feel. the female singer has a cool, relaxing voice, but the layer that really surpised and interested me was the use of strings and other orchestral sounds. altogether it has a modern/disco sound but the use of orchestra gives it a throwback feel and it just works very well for me. check it out"
1,A Disappointing and Naive take on House or Electronic Music,"I had read the reviews of this album and picked it up on the strength of the positive comments, but I was shocked at how terrible this album was. Understanding Herbert's classical piano background, I expected a deep and nuanced interpretation of house that could combine interesting danceable beats with a solid 4x4 backbone, but some rhythmic variation and interesting found sounds from the claims of so many odd samples used. The first thing that put me off was the terrible vocals, which combine the cheesy and trite lyrical stylings of the worst diva-house with the shallow wording of your local folk music open mic. The rhythms were also boring, none of the more interesting layering ontop of the standard house beat, but a very shallow and superficial interpretation you would expect to find on a Casio keyboard.Stay away!"
1,Worst album ever,"This was the worst thing I've ever heard, except maybe Clap Your Hands Say Yeah. My cousin who has absolutely no musical taste introduced me to them and I hate them forever."
5,The best sampler.,This is a fantastic little teaser for those chiliheads that are just cutting their teeth. It also makes a great gift.
5,Fascinating details about familiar events,"I bought a copy of Weiser new a year or two before it went out of print. For many years I have hoped someone would reprint this book. Weiser writes from a Roman Catholic perspective and includes a number of observances unique to the Roman Catholic Church. But, most of the book deals with holidays common to all Christians. Little things associated with a particular holiday, like the Easter parade, are explained in the context of their original Christian purpose. Further, the book explains differences in observance as practiced in different nations and cultures. It is a wealth of information I have used very often during the last thirty years.The most useful portions of the book deal with holidays like Christmas, Easter, and Halloween, etc. Surprisingly, much of this material from Weiser is showing up on the Internet. Do a search for ""Weiser Handbook of Christian Feasts"" and you will find it without hunting for a copy of the book."
4,Nice selection.,"Anna Netrebko has a marvelous voice. This album contains some very interesting repertoire, ending with a fine rendition of the letter song from Eugene Onegin. If you want a good selection of Russian opera to listen to this is as good as any."
5,Russian Album: Anna Netrebko,"Amazing coloratura singing to delightful compositions by Tschaikovsky, Prokofiev, Rimsky-Korsakov, Rachmaninoff and Glinka. Enchanting, lilting music. Miss Netrebko's voice is perfect for this music."
5,beauty and the beast,"I haven't come across statistical records of how often beauty,in a women,meets talent,but surely this is the case. Anna's voice is a mirror image of her features: clean and seductive,yet powerful. She controls the beast(that's how I would rename ""lirica"",as we call opera music) to her pleasure,modulating softeness and power to perfection. If performing russian opera music was intended to be a further test to her capabilities, well singing in her mother language has only confirmed her as really outstanding. Anna has added a touch of russian romanticism to the execution of this beast."
5,Wondrous compilation that embraces part of the flaming lyric soul of the Russian repertoire!,"Anna Netrebko is nowadays, one of the maxim divas del bel canto. Her magnificent timber, charismatic presence, enchanting scene, dazzling charm and alluring beauty have catapulted her to the most inexpugnable heights of the Opera.In this case, we have an admirable and prodigal compilation of expressive and beloved themes of the great Russian repertoire. Conducted by the great Valerie Gergiev, the outcome couldn't be but successful. One of the most fascinating and emblematic albums of the first decade of this century.Don't miss it this enjoyable and glorious CD. It's part of the most recent musical legacy."
3,The Empress Has Clothes ?,"This Pig does not know a lot about Sopranos, but if she is , why did they not record her voice more forward in the recording. The recording gives her little more presence than a back up singer. I thought all great singers sing from the diaphragm. She seems to be very throaty. I love many of the Russian arts, particularly literature (tolstoy et al ) and Shostakovich (my favorite 20th century classical composer , get the 5th and 7th ) but i will not fall for this Empress as I am not sure she has clothes. Perhaps i should.I do like the album very much."
4,A Very Sweet Album In A Very Schmaltzy Sort Of Way,"This is not an easy album to review. Astrud was famous as the bossa nova queen from Brazil but this album is different. Some of the tracks on this album are psychedelic pop from the late 60's. The cut, ""Beginnings"", is an excellent arrangement with some jazz improvising going on by Airto. However, many of the arrangements of these 60's songs are strangely cheesy but captivating. There are some fine jazz musicians on this album that somehow elevate this pop music to higher level. Airto and Toots Thielemans are just two that I can think of off hand. ""Love Is Stronger Far Than We"" is one of those sweet but schlocky arrangements that works incredibly well. Astrud's unusual and somewhat quaverly voice comes off as being sweet and vulnerable. It all works but I can't say exactly how. This is a must-have album because of its unusual niche in music history. This is a very good CD. You'll enjoy it. Buy it before it disappears."
5,"Inspirational, affecting memoir","This very beautiful book strongly influenced my family's own Jewish observance. Lester's journey to Judaism was plagued with self-doubts, familial fear and uncertainty, and suspicion and disdain from his peers and friends. Through it all, he lovingly describes the unending pull of Judaism and how he eventually found himself and his place in the world."
5,great music,"Stravinsky earned recognition as the 20th century's greatest composer because every note he composed is where it is how it is for definite real reasons. Listening, a result of that is that all his music resonates with a great sense of order. This is great music. This recording is better than others for these pieces."
5,Great and curious,"Well, if you're a The Police fan and you like to hear classic tunes on a new dimension don't loose the opportunity to hear that fantastic CD."
2,An embarrassment,"I bought this CD in anticipation it would have the classic, great material and standard of Ms. Houston. Boy! Was I wrong! After I bragged about the ""princess of soul"" coming out with a new CD to all my friends, I was embarrassed to play it.Fist, its too short, it gives off the message she no longer values her work or integregrity.secondly, what happened to her voice! It once was sweet, and soulful, remember ""I will always love you""? Not that quality on this CD. By this CD used or burn it from a friend!"
1,Focus on Whitney please....,"...P>As for the album, yes, it's a must-have for fans. That's why they're called fans right? As for regular listeners, the album is weak. 10 songs is lacking. It's more of a work-in-progress rushed to meet the Holiday deadline. Bad move. Whitney sounds tired too. Her voice isn't what it used to be. Oh well, if ou want Whitney this Chirstmas, get My Love is Your Love instead."
2,I've heard better,"This album feels quite rushed, she wanted to escape the media's so she decided to make a new album. Many of the songs got a lack of a good hook and Whitney's normal vocal power is not there. Hit single ""whatchulockigat"" is one example of a dull song. There's a cover of ""You Light Up My Light"" which will soon be forgotten and ""Things you say"" a Missy Elliot written song. ""My love"" is a duet with husbund Bobby Brown, i've heard better work them both, Bobby Brown that used to be so good back in the day. There are 3 Babyface songs though which are ok, and "" One of Those days"" is probably the album's highlight. But apart from that, his album is quite weak, When Whitney decided to make a studio album we certainly have higher expectations then this. This album is more or less about ""leaving her alone"" then giving us fans a nice xmas present."
3,"Coming back, but slowly...","I am rating this album on the fact that Whitney has been through h-e-l-* during these past few years. The cd is half good and half bad. It starts off with the song ""One of Those Days"", which I like but think was just too mediocre for Whitney. Other highlights are ""Tell Me No"", and ""Unashamed"". ""Try it On My Own"" reminds me of the old school Whitney, and the vocals are in tip top shape on this song. I also enjoy ""Whatchalookinat"" eventhough it didn't receive too much airplay. I think we all know that voice is not what is use to be, but hopefully this is a healing process that will bring her back to those roots. If you are a Whitney fan, buy the cd but don't be looking for any new material here just some plain songs with the powerful voice. If you want to hear some really good music, dust off the The Bodyguard Soundtrack, or ""My Love is Your Love"" cd."
3,Just okay,"This wasn't a dissappointment, but, definitely wasn't the diva of old. It doesn't stir the emotions as some of her other work has in the past, but she still has the ""voice."" Just steer clear of ""You light up My Life"" what was she thinking?"
3,Not bad but...,"It's listenable and not at all terrible; however, 'Charmbracelet' and 'Stripped' are both going to spank this album good on the charts. I can't think of a better way than that to say what I think of 'Just Whitney'."
3,Great Album!!!,"Whitney continues to demonstrate her place in music history. As a diehard Whitney fan, I am always excited when she puts out her best. The three stars are because there's only ten tracks and thirty minutes of music. She covers Debbi Boone's classic ""You light of my life"" with fire and passion. Her duet with her husband has an old-school r&b feel to it. If urban radio stations stop hatin', we probably hear more of Whitney's vocal prowness and her defined sound."
3,"Good, but...","As a tried and true Whitney fan, I have to say that this album leaves alot to be desired. Mostly because I appreciate Whitney's talent and was looking forward to this studio release. Although it's too short it is not a BAD collection. Let's hope that she's working on another release that will be more consistent with her abilities!"
3,"Awesome vocal performance, but average material","3.5 stars, but not 4. I just finished listening to the album and was very happy with Whitney's silky smooth vocals. The girl can still sing like a goddess. The only disappointment is the album material. I really miss the modulating chord changes of the earlier Whitney, but the song Dear John Letter is nice and soulful. Not bad considering everything Whitney has been through lately..."
5,To Hell w/Negative Critics -- Possibly Best CD of the Year,"Despite problems, Houston is back with the powerhouse vocals that made her a star of unparalleled talent and success. In an era of Jenny on the Block and other syrupy sweet (read corny) pop, repetitive techno beats and/or non stop rap, its great to hear some old school soul finally coming from the radio. Maybe I can end my self imposed strike of pop and soul radio, should I hear more of this kind of music coming from the industry. Whitney reminds us why she became the star that she did over the past two decades. Bravo!"
3,"Whitney's strikes back, but misses the bullseye","After the disappointed first single, I thought Whitney's album would fail to surpass my expectations. But I was wrong, she managed to arrange great producers - Babyface, Corey Rooney, Missy Elliot and herself. She delivers her powerful vocals in all of her songs, most of them upbeat. ""One of Those Days"", is a delicious mid-tempo song, but again she insists in telling us she received too many criticism on her behaviour and she needs to ""set her body free"". ""Unashamed"", is quite similar - ""Unashamed of the live that I lived.."", C'mon, she could've been more creative if she really wanted a comeback. Well, anyway, the album is still very good, as I said before the production is good, only the lyrics sometimes are weak. But if you're looking for Whitney in her best form, you better check ""My Love is your Love""."
5,Just Whitney Rocks,"I absolutely love this CD. I think she has captured the essence of the vibes behind the songs. I love the videos for ""One of those Days"" and ""Try It On My Own."" This is Whitney doing what Whitney does, rocking the songs. She can still make you feel her emotions as she sings. Whether she is talking about having a hard week, the love she and Bobby share, loving your man period, or telling folks to get out of her business, she rocks it. Some of the songs you just find yourself moving to. I ain't got nothing but love for Whitney."
3,"Strong, but not for Whitney","Whitney Houston is a true class act. Or WAS. In my mind this album would have earned four stars except for what I heard Whitney sing on ""I'm Your Baby Tonight"". Songs like 'Try it on My Own' are very good songs, but it does not showcase her talents. I have a couple of these on my Mp3 player (""Unashamed"",""Dear John Letter"", and ""Love That Man"") but I don't think I would put these as Whitney's songs. The bottom line is that Whitney had a wonderful voice while doing songs like ""I Have Nothing"", ""I will Always Love You"", ""I Belong to You"", and ""Greatest Love Of All"", but listen to this album, then put on one of the earlier ones, and you cannot call this Whitney. Whitney should glance over at Mariah Carey whose career hit the skids in 2001 with her underrated movie Glitter, but has bounced back to be the most successful female artist of this decade as well as the last. I would love to see Whitney bounce back to the former diva she was."
2,"Mercifully, it clocks in at less than forty minutes!","I kept waiting for the SONG that would make this a worthwhile purchase, but it never came. A fellow Amazon.com reviewer, of whom I trust immensely, had warned me.Why didn't I listen to him before forking up my hard-earned cash???Maybe, Whitney was trying to play catch up with those ""come latelies"" that seem to have dethroned her as one of pop royalty. This mismatch of throwaways is so much beneath her that this album is an embarrassment for all concerned.I mean, if she had even taken the chestnut ""You Light Up My Life"" and made it into one of those dance tracks that she does so well, she might have gained another star.And whom is she trying to convince of her devotion to husband Bobby with ""My Love"", him or herself?"
1,Not good at all....,"I love Whitney Houston and picked up her new CD last Friday - quite frankly I thought it stunk....I even played it twice thinking it was me, but I didn't hear one song that I really, really liked."
1,BIG DIS-APPOINTMENT,"Just Whitney should have been called Where's Whitney.In half of the songs you can't even recognize the once famous voice. She's lost it.I used to be a huge Whitney Fan, but this CD was a total disappointment for me.She can't even carry a tune anymore!!!!She offers many fast beat fast singing songs because she knows she can't sing ballads anymore.I saw her live on ABC and she TRIED to sing Jesus Loves Me, where she totally trashed the song with her scratchy voice."
1,Just Terrible!!,"Poor Whitney. Can there be a WORST R&B album release in 2002, than Whitney's new cd ""Just Whitney""? The music on here is not only bad, but she acts like that somebody MADE her record this album. She sound so angry about EVERYTHING, that it was a drag to even listen to this cd. But what is worst about this album is its only about 35 minutes with 10 songs. C'mon now, Whitney. We are in an era where artists do at least 14 songs and about one hour worth of music. She needs Clive Davis back in her career because this album is not happening. Pass on this one, for sure!!!"
2,What do you expect from a title like...Just Whitney Anyway?,"I have no problem with this cd or the artist's work it represents. That said, every artist has peaks and valleysin their careers. No one can stay on top forever. Theinterview Whitney did with Diane Sawyer is her business.People get real! When you sign a contract with a recordlabel for 100 mil. you can do what you'd like. She reallydoesn't have to record another album anyway. The big standout track on this one is ""Tell Me No."" You go girl!"
1,Whitney's Voice Is Gone,"I sampled this cd and couldn't believe what I heard. Whitney's voice has is just.....gone. She can barely hold a note now. It was getting bad on the ""My Love Is Your Love"" album but it was tollerable there. But now it's just...terrible. Not only that, there's really no good production on this album. Even if there was, I could take the sound of a cracked out Whitney. I miss the old Whitney."
2,Just Whitney Not Worth The Money,"When I purchased 'Just Whitney' on the day it came out, I had high hopes that it was going to be an album that showcased herself as an incredible vocalist and artist. However, ""Just Whitney"" seems not to be an album that truely represents her, but maybe in reality it does. It is a very short album with only two songs that are noteworthy. These songs, One Of Those Days and Try It On My Own, are classic examples of what made her a superstar. However, the rest of the tracks are ordinary, washed up tunes and formula that virtually every artist uses. This album is untimately not worth the while of purchasing, except for the two songs listed above."
1,one word,"BORING! nothing original, nothing that stands out, nothing on here that justifies running out and buying this CD....bottom line, SAVE your MONEY! P.S if I could give it 0 stars, I would in a heartbeat!"
1,She is a HOT MESS!,"That is all- if there were o stars, I would give that to her!Don't support an addict!"
3,She Gets Everybody Told and Told and Told Again,"How many defensive messages should an amazing artist like Whitney Houston include on one CD? I can bear one or maybe two, but Whitney's latest collection, including ""Tell Me No"", ""Try It On My Own"", ""Unashamed"" and ""Whatchulookinat"", is an overload of defending and explaining. Now for the good news... the soulful ""Things You Say"" and ""My Love"" featuring Bobby Brown at his best are worth the price of the CD."
2,Such a disappointment!,I'm being nice by giving this two stars. I only like one song on the entire album. She spent so much time bashing the media in the songs that she really didn't record anything worth listening to. This is painful proof that Whitney's days as a singing diva are OVER! May she rest in peace.
3,More of the same,"Whitney's got the voice and she knows how to use it. I'm still a fan of the music, although not a fan of her as a person (she needs help, seriously).I bought this album and while Whitney is up to par as far as her voice goes, the choice of material could have been improved upon. This sounds like more of the same of what she has done already. As far as Whitney's musical world goes, ""Just Whitney"" presents nothing new under the sun."
3,not the old whitney...but that doesn't really make it bad,"well we must face, people get older, voices changes and maybe their outlook on music changes also. so here is the case of the beautiful whitney houston. this album to me isn't a total flop. i honestly cannot say what my expectations on this album were, because we all knew the circumstances surround ms. houston. the songs are a 3.5 on a 5.0 scale. i'm not disappointed in the sense that this isn't the best album, but i was hoping for more."
2,DISAPPOINTED...Mediocre Work At Best!!!,"Whitney has lost her outstanding voice. The things she has been doing has killed her famous voice that made her a star. The only single on this album worth anything is ""One of these days"", thank goodness Nelly remixed it. And the cover of ""You light up my life"", is down right awful. I dont like the songs at all, she uses them to tell us what she thinks of her life, and what she thinks is really sad to me. ""Unashamed of the choices she's made""...its laughable. I use to be a great fan of her music, but I just don't know anymore...She has just deteriorated so much, ""the great voice"" is gone...I wish her the best of luck. Maybe her next endeavour will be better, but you know, the voice is just not there anymore...so sad."
1,Don't waste your money,"Whitney needs help, ya'll! And you can tell from this CD. Very uninspired music. Try again..."
4,As much as it will hurt me!,"I have been a big fan of whitney but despite the great reviews on this album, I will not be purchasing 'Just Whitny'. The simple reason being I have no intention of helping to pay for Whitney's drug fuelled destructive lifestyle. Whitney you need to dump the husband, get some rehab and come back to us tall and strong. Buying your album would be like giving an alcoholic more drink, which is something, I just won't do."
2,"well, maybe the next one will be better....","I can easily say that vocally this is Whitney's worst album ever. It sounds a lot like ""My Love is Your Love"" with all the hits taken off that album. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Whitney fan, but there's definitely something missing from this set. I hoped that after listening to it a few times it would grow on me a little more, and it has, but not enough for me to be glad I got it. The songs range from sounding fake (""Try it on my own"") to being extremely cheesy (""My Love"" ""Whatchulookinat"" and ""Unashamed"") to just plain unnecessary (""You Light Up My Life""). The only good points are ""One of Those Days"" and ""Tell me no."" The former finds Houston sounding her best in a laid-back r&b groove. The latter, though definitely lacking in vocal quality, comes closest to sounding like a true Whitney anthem."
3,Just Average!,"Whitney once had THE voice! The one angels gathered around to hear and what was once glory to the ears has been replaced with a wrecked havoc of a tool. On occasion she does rises above that are now placed on her voice as on the brilliant songs ""Try it on my own"" & ""You light up my life"" but at just 39 minutes of subpar songs and only sparse hints of her former talent, Just Whitney is just ok. The magic was always in her method of interpertation of song but even that is weakend, Missy Elliott is able to coax an AMAZING song from her though ""Things you say"" is classic Whitney souled R&B...now why isn't the rest of the disc."
1,An all new low for whitney,What the hell went wrong Whitney? dont you even try to use your voice anymore I mean this is just plain pathetic I only bought it because I have all of her other albums. And I swear to god the next album is so much better than this
2,I love the woman...but,"I love whitney houston's voice; it really is one hell of an awesome instrument. But the question is where's it gone?I don't want to get into her personal life, thats her affair, but when she spends an entire album trying to justify her personal choices it becomes very bizzare and a little sad.co-produced by her partner in crime bobby brown, with tracks written by babyface and missy elliot amongst others its a patchy affair. 'tell me no' is a fabulous rant with a slammin gitaur lick but thats about all I liked. her voice sounds ravaged at times, and has lost the gorgeous purity that set it apart. now she just sounds like every other belter and i can't tell you how sad it was to realise that.i hope she packs up the ciggies (and whatever else!) soon and sorts her voice out, theres no reason she couldn't, but then again as she sais in 'tell me no' she'll always do it her way."
1,"Should I buy, or should I not?","I am a long time fan of Whitney Houston and there was once upon a time when I would buy her music just because it was Whitney. Now I am very hesitant about purchasing ANY of her music because the one single I heard on the radio did not sound good at all to me. The reviews I have read have helped me alot in reference to purchasing her c.d. I would advise anyone who is thinking about purchasing her c.d. to listen to it first before you purchase it. It is so sad that Whitney Houston seemed to have lost the talent that the Good Lord gave her to drugs. She was once a classy lady and now she is hooked on drugs. I too saw her on the Diane Sawyer show on ABC. Not only did she seem to have been high on something, Bobby looked VERY HIGH. I hope one day soon she comes to her senses, leave Bobby and let go of the drugs and be a real mother to Bobbi Christina. Whitney I am begging you to please get help before it's too late.Be Blessed.DD"
1,A Sad Fall for Whitney: Commercial Fluff,"Whitney Houston arguably has the most beautiful and capable vocal range of any female in the last 2 decades, but sadly this album disgraces her talent. After a suprise comeback with great songs like ""Heartbreak Hotel"" and ""My Love Is Your Love"" on her stellar previous album, this album reflects her lack of focus on both vocals and artistry. None of the songs challenge the talents of her voice at all, nor do they even make you want to dance. The songs are empty and lifeless, devoid of emotion. Perhaps personal problems in her life have taken a toll. Suprising that many other reviewers here on Amazon just can't grasp what a failure she has produced in relation to her skill. Let's hope for better next time. Perhaps Betty Ford can help..."
4,WILL ALWAYS LUV WHITNEY...BECAUSE SHE JUST WHITNEY,"The girl is just amazing, even though she can hit some high notes like she used to. The girl still has a voice to be reckon with.The songs that really grabbed me is ""Tell Me NO"" which is a song that telling people no matter how many times she can't do this, she going to keep on keepin on doing her thing-music.""Things You Say"" talking about the way you feel when you by the person you love, and the wonderful things they say to make you feel good.""My Love"" a wondeful a duet with Mr. Brown.A song that is the great love they share through thick and thin.""Love That Man"" she saying how to stick by your man like the old school days, and don't leave him just because of something.you got to stick the fightDang, I just love the whole album.The only song I don't like is Dear Johns Letter. The beat,and the lyrics just don't make sense to me.OH...BUT GET THE ALBUM..DON'T LET TEN SONGS GET YOU DOWN..THE TEN SONGS SHE POOR HER HEART AND SOUL INTO.LUV WHITNEY"
1,Disappointment,"To start things off this cd is only 39 minutes long which means it should be at least a great 39 minutes to warrant a purchase. However I could only find one song that I really liked and it wasn't even up to her potential. I recommend this album only if you are a die hard whitney fan, otherwise go pick up her last album if you haven't it is so much better."
4,Different &#65533; but for a sadly reason.,"Her life of abuses took away her beautiful and powerful voice, but instead or lying on her bed watching her career fade into oblivion she took an extremely courageous step and launched an album in which she explored a more modern yet less vocally demanding style. The result was very good, but good old Whitney simply isn't there anymore.No matter how fantastic some of these songs are, it is impossible to hear them without being faced with the sad reality that difficultly we'll ever hear Whitney sing any of her old songs, at least with the same voice that used to throw us against our seats.A well managed yet sad change."
3,not her best,"I give up. I love whitney but at 39 her voice is changed forever.Thr amazing flexiblity in the upper register is gone. Hpwever she is still better than half the singers out there. Best tracks are one of these days, tell me no and surprsingly yes you light my life"
4,IT IS PRETTY GOOD,"Altougth ""Just Whitney"" is not as good in vocal arobics as her previous albums, the lyrics are strong and she conveys want she is taking about well. The one songs that she really shows some of the strength she used to utilize is ""You Light Up My Life"". A good album, however the vocals could and should be stronger. I also recommend : Thelma Houston- ""Best Of""(Import)"", Nayobe-""Please Don't Go"" and Robin S.-""From Now On""."
2,Artist Grow,I understand an artist growing and changing the style of music for what is going on in their life. I am very disappointed in Whitney's new CD. It sounds like she is going backwards. Hey Clive it's one of those days. Whitney needs your help.
2,huge dissapointment,"now, I didn't expect another my love is your love, but coming from whitney, I did expect to hear some good music.I have to say that Whitney has really dissapointed me.There's no way to describe what is so bad about the songs.Something's missing though, that's for sure.But the saddest thing is this, just as with Mariah, Whitney has lost that majestic voice.Her voice just does not sound the same.She cannot carry out the notes like she used to, and her voice often cracks.And was it really neccecary to do a cover of ""light up my life"".It's really sad to see such a great singer succumb to this.Also, the length is pathetic.It doesn't even feel like listening to a full cd.And whitney has lost the voice.She has, and that is the saddest truth of all."
1,Totally Disappointed Fan,"I am a bit disappointed with this release.I cannot believe I have waited this long for this substandard piece of work. Of the ten songs on the CD, I am only enjoying one (One of Those Days. You did a good job reaching back to a melody that's recognized enough to keep the listener interested).What happened to the Whitney of yesterday? I believe in growth, and experimenting with new ideas, but the vocals are not there.I would have been satisfied if you put out a CD of remakes, using your powerhouse vocals. Whitney has a unique way of adding pizzazz to older songs to make them her own. Although there is a cover of You Light Up My Life, it lacks gusto and emotion. Come on Whitney get it back together, I am still a fan, and will always be one. However, please select better material for your next release and realize that you are not in the same age group as Britney and the likes. You have millions of fans that LOVE the voice, not what's current in the industry."
2,HATED IT!,"i've always loved whitney's music, but now a days she just dosen't have it anymore. this album lacked in a lot of areas. the album sounds like something that was thrown together. my advice i would not but it."
1,"Rob, Wash State","39 Minutes of lack luster performances! Whitney needs to gain conciousness and reclaim her voice, if she can. Entire CD has voice overs to hide her failing ability to hit the ""high"" notes. Tracks 1 and 6 are the only decent songs on the abulm, which I doubt will get much airplay.The diva has reached a new low. It's heartbreaking to think that the voice of the century was wasted by self-destruction."
2,Whitney Wha....?,"It looks as though Whitney is showing the same symptoms as the Other Greats of the 80's and 90's (Mariah, Madonna etc). Great vocal talents can't save you from non-catchy tunes that go no where. In my opinion, Whitney has one good song, Tell Me No, her ""prove you wrong, Can't keep me down"" type song, Unfortunately, It didn't work for Mariah, so I doubt that she could have pulled it off as a No. 1 hit. The rest of the songs are slow and tiresome, and offer nothing New and catchy. I would certainly pass purchasing this album, and go for one of the ""Classic"" Whitney albums (or greatest hits)."
3,Disappointed,"Theres not much one can say. Whitney was once upon a time the greatest singer in the world and sold millions of albums. Now a days, she sounds hunsky and tired. She would be lucky if this album goes gold. My 3 stars was based on sympathy. Back in the day when her songs had meaning, Instead of singing about Bobby, she was a mega super star. Few tracks on this album made me bop my head. ""Unashamed"" and ""Dear John"". As for the rest, there still forcing to sound likeable. Well Whitney, it looks like all you have now is ""Just Bobby"", which sums up to having nothing. To all the X-Whitney fans out there. Do us all a favor and don't make another album Whitney. I feel like theres no hope. Prove me wrong."
3,Just OK,This album was OK nothing spectacular...if you seen Whitney on the Divas Duets...her vocals must have been digatally edited on this album for them to sounmd that good...all I have to say...she made an OK effort...
1,Just [bad],"Is this ""Just Whitney""? Well, it's just [terrible]. Trust me, this performer is sooo talented...but the material she got was just horrible. ...And she was just as pathetic to agree with the release, no wonder sales fell right after the release.The best 2 songs (yes only ... TWO songs) are:Try It On My Own (Classic slow Whitney jam, Babyface produced A+)Tell Me No (Nice guitars, it features Carlos Santana)Even though those TWO songs totally rock, she needs Clive Davis desperately, this is not a good album like ""My Love is Your Love.""Except for those two songs, it's not even worth downloading."
1,Dissapointment,Well u got to listen to this record in order to know how bad it is.... Trust me on this one!
1,Horrific!,"This album was one big horrific nightmare. I have always enjoyed Whitney's voice, but on this album she appears to be angry at the entire world. I would have preferred her to lose the attitude and just sing. I am beginning to think she has brought everything upon herself. Her career is definitely over. Not good music, plain and simple!!"
1,Something Went Wrong!,"I used to be a huge Whitney fan, and when I heard she was releasing a new album. of course I rushed out the day of the release to get it and put it into my cd player.I was really disappointed.The voice is gone!!The album did not sell well at all,it debuted at #9 on Billboard 200 and dropped quickly..and only going platinum...Whitney is used to going 4 platinum or higher......I hope she does better next time....Her last great album was My Love Is Your Love.Skip the Greatest Hits,and this one.Her Christmas album isn't all that well either."
3,a DECENT ALBUM,"HER 5TH STUDIO ALBUM IS A DECENT ALBUM NOT BETTER THAN MY LOVE IS YOUR LOVEBUT STILL WORTH BUYING IN MY OPINION .THE HIGHLIGHTS AREONE OF THOSE DAYS, THINGS YOU SAY,TELL ME NO, LOVE THAT MAN , TRY IT ON MY OWN,AND YOU LIGHT UP MY LIFE"
3,Whitney's still got it.,"Not as estranged as her last disc, ""My Love is Your Love""; however, Whitney did have quite a few remixed hits off that disc. I rate ""Just Whitney"" as more toned down R&B/pop. ""Just One of Those Days"" is a cool jam which Whitney does best. My personal favorite is her ballad, ""Try It On My Own"". ""Whatchulookinat"" should have never been produced. After all, she is dissing the media for her personal life, yet comes out on public tv and admits her personal problems. It is mediocre at best. The club remix is popular though. I was disappointed that there were only 10 tracks on this disc, but all in all, not too terribly disappointed. For all the criticism she has gotten lately for drug abuse and for hubby Bobby Brown's dealings, she still has the voice!"
4,Take that!!,Whitney houston came back with a bang! THis is not her best album but it is definetly up there. With stong ballads that make you think about I wiill always love you days and mainstream hits that bring you back to 2002 you realize that Whitney is back and better than all of those other female artist out! And to all you haters! Dont be mad! Go back to work and keep on jamming Whitney
2,Where is Whitney???,"What happened to Whitney's voice??? Her voice now sounds tired and it seems that the vocal damage is permanent. Four years ago, I assumed that her strained voice in MY LOVE IS YOUR LOVE was only temporary issue but I guess it wasn't... Obviously she still has problem with her voice.Better songs in JUST WHITNEY --> ONE OF THOSE DAYS, TELL ME NO, UNASHAMED.The worst songs --> YOU LIGHT UP MY LIFE (the original is much better than this version), TRY IT ON MY OWN (lyrically okay but the musical arrangements sounds flat or cheesy. I almost find this ""lyrics/music mismatch"" comical...), DEAR JOHN LETTER (just boring.)If you expect her BODYGUARD voice in JUST WHITNEY, you will be disappointed big time."
1,Ugh..What happened!,"There is a reason why the first 2 singles off of this album have bombed on the charts (""Whatchulookinat"" peaked at 96 & ""One of Those Days"" at 84)--they are BAD! Whitney has a great voice..more so with her past efforts than now...but something is lacking here. It sounds as though these songs are not complete and needed more treatment in the studio and she just can't belt a tune out like she used to be able to. It is a shame that someone with such vocal talent allowed herself to ruin it and is now forced to sing such laughable, lackluster songs."
2,Queen of the past.,"Whitney may had been one of the most important singers in the 80's and 90's with incredible sellings and hits like ""I'll always love"", ""I wanna know"" or her latest hits from 1999 ""My love is your love"" and ""Heartbreak hotel"". But this latest work is nothing compared with her past works. The album has good songs like ""One of those days"" or ""Whatulookinat"" but the rest in not good at all.This is the first time that Bobby Brown takes credits in one of her albums and the answer is not good.As an example I can say that not only in the taste of her public but in the charts the album went nowhere it debuted at #9 but dropped very fast, it only recived Platinum status which is good for any singer but if we compare her charting and selling history we can say that this album hasn't been a hit at all.It seams that wen singers sign a new record deal they get nerviuos or just don't work as hard as they did, because we have 2 examples of that, Mariah and Whitney."
4,Making A Comeback,"This is a very good album for Whitney to stage a comeback. Although this album isn't as good as My Love Is Your Love was, it is still ""listenable"". The stellar track on this album for me is ""Things You Say"" and ""Unashamed"". The latter being a testimony on how she feels about her actions. I am a Whitney fan of the utmost but ""Tell Me No"" should have been shelved or given to someone else. Critics better believe Whitney is back and she ain't going nowhere."
4,"Welcome Back, Whitney","With the exception of Watchulookinat, this album is fantastic. The voice is back with a vengeance. Ignore the haters, this one is a keeper."
2,Just......AWFUL!,"This is the best she could come up with for her 100 million dollar contract!?! Her voice is all scratchy (probably the effects of her admitted drug use). Her songs are dated. Didn't Leann Rimes just remake ""You Light Up My Life"" a couple of years ago? (and did it better I might add)This album is better than the 1 star Mariah Carey album Charmbracelet; therefore I gave it 2 stars. There are at least two good songs on this one. ""Tell Me No"" and ""On My Own"" come the closest to sounding like classic Whitney, but that's the problem...Classic Whitney is tired and dated now. Mariah and Whitney have a problem. Unlike Madonna, they don't have the brains to re-invent their sound and this will be their downfall. If all you do is brag about your vocal ability, you better take care of that voice because you are nothing without it. Such is the case with Whitney."
3,Loving Whitney,U have to love Whitney she has one of the greatest voices of all times. Though she was on the verge of Jeopardizing it..She shows its still there ..This is CD could not of been any better for the state that she was in..I expected this..Its not the best of her but just to hear her sing..Makes my heart move..Whitney has just one of those voices....
3,whitney is back for more!,"Just Whitney... is a good R&B album, bringing back to the charts the talented whitney houston. The opening track ""whatchulookinat"" is a very biographical song, showing whitney is a strong artist, and despite all the critics and tabloids news won't simply give up a career she has built throughout the years. ""Tell me no"" is one of my favorite tracks of this album, because is a powerful song, with good lyrics. You should also check ""on my own"", a ballad in whitney's style and also the version she has recorded to ""you light up my life"". The duet whitney recorded with her husband, Bobby Brown will surely please R&B listeners. ""Just whitney"" is a good album afterall and deserves a place in your CD collection."
