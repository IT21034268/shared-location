1,Terrible Produce,Upon the receiving the product it function accordingly for ten minutes and failed after that point. Both cables failed to charge my Zune device. This is absurd to list an item as new and it does not function at all.
1,Cable DOA,"Cable is an aftermarket product, as was expected (not the Microsoft Zune cable shown in the picture). This would be fine if the cable worked. My Zune would not sync, and only charged intermittently. Amazon allowed a return and refund, but save your time and find a better cable."
4,Works great on 8G Zune,"The cable worked great to sync and charge thru the USB. The tip that connects to the Zune however is a bit flimsy, so Ive been really careful with it and so far no problems after 3 months. Gets the job done, decent buy."
5,great,"This has a nice long cable and is a perfect replacement for my lost zune cable, Works great, even better than the original one."
1,!!!DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP!!!!!,"This cable is NOT a true ZUNE product, it is an imitation (BAD ONE AT THAT) and does not work as promised. I am foolish for not reading the reviews/comments - please do not buy this POS! I only chose one-star because NO star wasn't an option. I am NOT happy with this product AT ALL.It's not worth the price, time to wait for the mail, or stress of attempting to get it to function properly. It is NOT 4 ft long, it's about 24"" at best, doesn't fit properly into the Zune, and is not recognized by any computer its plugged into."
2,Garbage,"I bought this back before they changed the product image. They used to have a picture of the official Zune cable with the Zune logo, so I got it not knowing that it's one of those cheap knock-offs. I was rather peeved by that.I just use the cable to charge my Zune, and it works for that, most of the time. Being cheaply made, it doesn't fit snugly in the device, so occasionally you walk away thinking it's charging, only to return and find your battery dead. This is annoying. The cable doesn't last very long either. I had two of these a while ago, and they both literally fell apart after about a year or two. On one of them, the plastic on the Zune-end literally fell to pieces when I squeezed it one day. On the other one, the squeeze button on the side fell out. If you plan to keep your Zune for a while, I recommend getting the official $7.99 Sync Cable from Zune on here."
3,zune cable,"I purchased this sync cable to replace my original, which I recently misplaced. It is not a microsoft product, but it seems to work ok."
3,"Works, but not the authentic Zune Cable.","Charges the zune I bought... however... its NOT the authentic Zune Sync Cable. A bit disappointed. I mean... the picture of the cable had the Zune logo on it, and is much better quality than the one I received. Granted, it was a lot cheaper."
4,It's alright for the Price,"The product doesn't seem to be as good of quality as my original zune sync cable, however it works as described and is a lot cheaper so I would probably buy it again if I had to."
3,Zune Sync Cable,"This Zune wire, failed to work the first couple times I tried to connect my Zune to the computer with it, but eventually is worked, and we are now able to charge the Zune and add music to it."
1,"Zune Sync Cable, dont seem like a true Zune product","First off, does not come in a Zune box, make me skeptical if its truly a Zune product or knock off. Secondly it does not fit good in my 120GB, it is very difficult to get out. When it is in, it does not fit tight, it is very loose and wobbly.....i would spend the $20 on the real thingPoorly represented product of what you get, cable says Zune on it but either it is knockoff or one that Zune got rid of for cheap cause it wasnt made right.Dont buy, will not buy from this place again."
1,Cheap knock off,"I bought this as I wanted a secondary charge cable. I do not know what company manufactures this cable but it is not Microsoft. It was cheaply made and in less than a week, it did not sync or charge my Zune. I highly advise against buying this."
1,Mine worked fine! Twice.,"Usually I have good luck with sticking to cheap-o, generic versions of items like power cords, car chargers, whatever. Not so with this item. It worked twice and then just stopped. Guess I'm going to go ahead and shell out for a Microsoft cable."
1,not OEM/ doesnt sync,"after close scrutinization the product isnt OEM, and the computer nor the zune 80gb mp3 player recognize it. waste of money, not worth my time or money to return due to intial cost of product. they burned me, dont get screwed like me. forced me to put 1 star, its a 0- star rating."
1,"Does not work, completely useless.","From the picture one would expect they are getting a zune sync cable, instead what you get in the mail is a cheap look-alike that does not even function. it will not charge the zune, nor will it sync any music. A complete waste of money, very misleading."
1,Stay away from this product.,"I got three of these and none work. Not only do they not properly synch with your computer but , you cann't even charge your Zune through this cable. They're certainly inexpensive, but ultimately, useless. I had to give at least one star to submit this review."
1,Not A Sync Cable,"I purchased this due to the price. Many of the reviews said it would not sync their Zune, only charge it. That's exactly what it does. It goes through the sync process, gets to 99% and then gives an error message that Zune Player Is Not Responding. It's not enough money to bother returning it, just wished I had believed the reviews that say it didn't work. Also, the picture shows an actual Zune sync cord, but what I got was not a Zune product."
3,Not as pictured,"Works fine, but the cable I received is not an authentic zune cable as pictured.Kinda disappointed, but not enough to return it"
1,Poor quality,"The cable works poorly. Power from USB connects only intermittently. Data does not connect at all. My Zune works fine with Microsoft authorized cable so the problem is certainly this ~$5 third-party cable.Also, the connector's plastic shell fell off during first use.Overall, bad product and bad experience."
1,Do not buy!,"First off it is not an authentic zune cable. It looks like a zune cable, fits in your zune like one but it does not work!"
2,"Well, at least it charges","It charges my Zune, so at least I have that. But it doesn't allow me to sync with the Zune, which is why I needed it.This really isn't an official cable. Buy it if you just need an extra charging cable or something, because it's useless otherwise."
5,Durable and worked exactly as described,"Durable and worked exactly as described. I bought this cord months ago and still use it frequently. I highly suggest this seller and product. The price is cheap, but the product is not."
4,Not as advertised (REVISED),"Image shown is original MS Zune cable--obviously this is third party. Connector is not proper size and fits very loosely, syncing occasionally is not possible with this cable--software doesn't recognize device.PLEASE NOTE: I previously left comments indicating this item did not work. This was incorrect--after checking with my other cable the issue turned out to be the AC adapter. Syncing issues with this cable were related to the state of the battery on the device at the time.All this being said I've revised my rating of this product--you get what you pay for, this item works as indicated and the cost is great."
4,Decent - Good,"Works for charging, although only in 1 of the 2 cars we own and that may have been because the Zune was entirely dead, and works for charging in wall outlet and syncing as far as we can tell. Paid for priority shipping and took much longer than expected to arrive (2-3 weeks) but overall, very satisfied considering the price (at the time $0.69 per). Purchased three from this source.Thanks!-Decent to Good Review"
1,zune sync cable,"the item that I bought,( the Zune Sync cable ) didn't work !!!! it was suposed to be new, but the cable was broke.will not buy from them again."
2,"Arrived damaged, was really lucky when it did work","The cable that arrived was slightly damaged; the end that connects to the Zune was broken so the only way I could sometimes get it to work was by shoving it in very quickly. Usually it just didn't connect, but sometimes I got lucky. Eventually it just stopped working, so I bought a new one from somewhere else that works just fine."
1,DOES NOT EVEN WORK,Cord does not work at all... plugged it in 2 different computers and did nothing!!! I didn't even charge it or anything!!!
1,Waste of time and money!,"I also was expecting a genuine Microsoft cable as shown in the picture, not. Cheaply made, not only would my Zune not sync, it wouldn't even charge! What could go wrong with a cable, right, wrong. I should have read the reviews first."
1,Not as pictured or described,"I bought this cable as a backup to leave at work to keep my Zune charged there. I wish I'd bought a cable directly from microsoft (gasp!) now.First, the picture shown is, apparently, a REAL Zune cable. The one you get doesn't have the silkscreened logo. No big deal, but you should probably show your own product, no?Second, the cable, for some reason, won't allow my Zune to sync with my computer. I don't know why. The connection is made, the Zune charges and the sync begins -- but I soon get an error message telling me the sync failed. (it keeps charging, which is a plus)I tried the zune with the original cable and sync complete -- seems like the cable (it doesn't make sense, I know, but it's the only thing that's different)oh, well, I got a recharging/AC cable for a few bucks, but it's not what I was looking for.Hope you have better luck..."
2,Didn't totally work,"I got this as a replacement for the cable that came with my daughter's Zune 4 GB. Unfortunately it doesn't work, at least not totally. The zune does charge when using the cable, but it wont sync."
2,Does not Sync! Only good for Charging!,Don't buy this if you need to sync your Zune. When connected to the computer you will receive an error message stating a malfunction and windows does not recognize it. This cable will only charge your Zune. Buy only if you need a cheap Zune Charging Cable and don't care about the Sync function.
1,"Synced once, then broke.","Terribly cheap knockoff wire. Worked fine the first time, and then basically stopped working completely. The Zune would recognize it but it wouldn't sync or charge. Go for the 10$ one, it's worth the extra little bit for a product that actually works."
1,A CHEAP KNOCK-OFF!!!,"I got this in the mail, excited. I had lost my original cord & haven't been able to listen to music for MONTHS. At first I noted that the zune logo wasn't on the product, & then later plugging the damn thing into my sisters laptop, nothing happened. It is clearly an imitation, NOT genuine. This is false advertisement, it is (apparently) NOT an original zune product.And to make matters more infuriating, the shipping charges were OUTRAGEOUS (10 DOLLARS). I tried to cancel the order since I bought it on a Saturday, & there is no post on Sundays, but they went with it anyways (obviously because they wanted to screw me with the shipping!!!) DO NOT BE TEMPTED with the low price, they will most likely screw you too.I'd give this crap 0 stars if I could."
1,Disappointed. Suggestion: Do not buy.,"I bought the cable, completely disregarding all the negative feedback on the item, as most people are just stupid and don't take of their possessions thus causing simple malfunctions. Now, although im sure there are a few of you whom have bought this product and have experienced the intended satisfaction from the seller, I believe most of you have had a similar experience to mine. When I received the item, I ""attempted"" to put it to use immediately. Such was not the case. After a brief examination, I found the issue, about 10-12 of the little teeth inside of the connector which plugs into the zune were missing. With all this being said I would definitely not recommend this product do to the disappointment you will most probably experience."
1,offbrand Zune cable,"Paid one day shipping, received next day.After plugging in the cord to see if worked, unplugged and wrote a good review, then I actually sat down to use the cord, it did not work. I checked my computer and Zune thoroughly and nothing wrong on my end.This is a cheaply made cord that is NOT worth purchasing from ANY seller.Not to blame the seller for product, because the seller did not make the product but the seller has to be careful what they sell. They don't want to be known for bad products."
1,CHEAP DON'T BUY!!!!,I bought this cable thinking i was getting a great deal. that was not the case this cable did nothing. it wouldn't charge or sync my zune DO NOT BUY THIS!!!! you will be wasting your time. i should have read the review a little more.
2,Off brand cable that isn't fully functional,"I'm usually fine with generic cables as long as they do everything the original cable does. I was extremely disappointed that this particular cable is almost worthless. When plugging my Zune HD into any of my 3 computers (running Win7 x64) it is not recognized at all. I couldn't even get it to charge through the USB port of the computer. However, when I plug the cable into a USB to wall adapter it charges just fine. This is a huge issue as I was planning to use this cable as a backup cable for my Zune HD at work, and now I can only use it to charge the mp3 player in conjunction with a USB to wall adapter. FAIL."
1,zune HD cable,"Hi guys, I have purchesed the zune HD Cable like 3 and a half weeks ago and I still don't have it in my posecion. I'm starting to think that this is a ripoff becuase the price was to good to be true. But O well still waiting for the cables hope they get here soon."
3,case falls apart,product does the job but the plastic casing on the connector falls apart very easily. i would feel better about the purchase had it been a bit more durable
4,"Works, but feels cheap","Nothing wrong with this cable really, but the regular Zune branded cable feels more durable. Also somewhat short, maybe 24 inches."
1,Doesn't charge 80GB Zune,"Great price, but they do not allow my Zune to charge via USB when used in the car.It did charge when plugged into a 120v adapter, with some wiggling."
3,Purchased for a Friend,A friend of mine received a Zune for free so she just needed a cable to be able to move music around with and charge up. As far as I know it worked great and she is still using it.
1,still have not received it,"Ordered it on 8 Dec 2011, was told it will reach me on 22 Dec 2011. It is now 15 Jan 2012 and I still do not have my Zune Sync Cable. Obviousley not a good delivering company."
2,Poor construction,"The first time I used the cable to connect my Zune one of the two tabs which releases the cable from the Zune fell off. As a result, it is very difficult to disconnect the cable. I can manually release the cable using a paperclip or small screwdriver in the spot where the tab fell off. I hope this is just a defective cable and not indicative of Microsoft Zune products."
4,Needed it - got it,Glad to be able to get these cables at a reasonable price now that most accessories in the store are for the new generation HD Zune and way more expensive.
5,Original Zune cable,You get exactly what is shown in the picture and it's the same one as the original cable that came with the Zune and all for a low price too! I love it.
2,Fragile sync cable,"The cable works as promised, however after a few months use one of the pressure button on the zune side fell off. It makes it hard to remove once inserted. I would look for another manufacturer than Zune if I had to buy a new one."
2,overpriced,I was a bit ticked off to see this advertised for twenty dollars. Look around for three minutes and you'll find a generic one for four.
4,It works for cheap,What kind of condoms I get is never that big of deal. They were good price for what I got. It saved me money from store bought and they even threw in a couple extra that was nice.
1,tried better,they're thin alright but they dry out so fast! and lube is just getting absobed by them so quickly! gosh! I can't wait to run out of them.
1,Junk,"I would give these condoms zero stars if I could; they are just terrible. I wonder if they are the real thing, or cheap counterfeits. They are the furthest thing from nothing at all. They don't break, which, but only because they are industrial strength. I'm throwing them away. Keep looking."
2,black mold,I recieved six boxes of these. each box had two or three that were moldy. the strawberry filling was covered in black fuzzy mold and you did not know it unless you opened them up and looked under the top layer. I ate half of one and it was nasty and it made me sick. they are good however when they are not garnished with fuzzy mold. I called Sorbee and they appolagized and new the boxes with the best by date of january 11 2008 were bad. they are sending me a check to replace them. if you need to number it is 215-677-5200
1,Maverick Mistakes in Real Estate Investing,"Simply horrible, describes how the author blows hundreds of thousands of dollars."
1,"Great Concept, Horrible Execution","Lupo starts with a fine concept that he fails to convert into a book of any actual substance. While certainly true that one can learn as much from failures to successes, very few of anecdotes provide actionable recommendations."
5,Worth reading!,"The author has candid, realistic and practical advice about common pitfalls and how to avoid them. I particularly found three chapters useful, Chapter 1 on healthy skepticism regarding seminar speakers, Chapter 8 on growing your real estate properties successfully, and Chapter 19 on property management. The author guarantees a 100% money back guarantee so you have nothing to lose. It is easy to read, amusing, and full of practical information. I highly recommend this book for anyone serious about successful real estate investing.Jolen, Ventura, CA"
3,Out of Print Since Fischer was a Kid,"Sam Sloan may be the sleaziest chess writer of all time. He would probably take that as a compliment, since he has boasted in print about having sex with child prostitutes in Thailand.Nevertheless, nobody else has gone to the trouble of reprinting this little book. Fischer's analysis is hardly in-depth, but it does give some insight into the development of a young chess genius.The book is pretty outrageously priced, considering the minimal content. Nothing in it is likely to make you a better player. Maybe if it goes out of print, it'll become a collectors' item.For a few dollars more you can get Karsten Mueller's book that has all of Fischer's games. That way you'll be supporting a real chess player, not just some pervert."
4,A poetic look at being 25 in a new city.,"This is a great book of short stories about the triumphs, tribulations, and craziness of being young and moving to a new city for the first time. It captures those giddy days when a mattress on the floor was as good a bed as any, twinkies and coffee was the breakfast of champions, and we were all seriousness and silliness at the same time. The writing takes a bit of getting used to and reads more like poetry than straight prose, but it forces the reader to slow to an Austin pace to pick up the often hilarious nuances and subtlety of character that make this a great read."
1,Same old nonsense about Oxford,"If I were to attempt to prove someone other than Shakespeare wrote Shakepeare, just about the last Elizabethan nobleman Iwould nominate would be the 17th Earl of Oxford. In fact, Iwouldn't nominate this murderer, depraved , writer of terribleverse as having done anything of value, aside from abandoning his kids, running thru his fortune, getting syphillus abroad,and ending up in virtually in the poor house. Whalen consistently avoids direct evidence and willingly accepts the most implausible scenarios, where conspirators keep up the conspiracy (which has no purpose, in any logical sense) even in their private diaries and personal copies of plays 25 years after the man is dead!!! By comparison, JFK conspiracy theories look plausible, all 2000 of them!"
3,Slight & superficial,"Despite some pretence at objectivity, Whalen is clearly an Oxfordian proponent and scants the case for the Stratford man. Even his Oxford case is on the thin side, although much more easily digested than any Ogburn opus."
5,"A ""must"" read for Nurses!!!","This book is like a bible to me. I have read the book several times, picking it up, reading parts...and always being empowered by it. I would highly recommend this book for nurses of all walks. Authors, Buresh & Gordon help nurses understand the deliberate dimantling of their profession/healthcare and give them clear tools (with examples) on how to reclaim their most valued existance. Nurses and their patients have a symbiotic relationship...if nursing is lost...so are their patients. From Silence to Voice will teach the reader how to enlist the public for survival. Thank you to Ms. Buresh & Ms. Gordon. The reader won't be disappointed!"
2,"Whiney, superficial","This book aims to be both a calling on nurses to bring attention and respect to nursing in the media and the general public, and it also serves as a ""how-to"" guide for accomplishing that. But some things you just can't teach. To change nursing, you're going to have to change the nursing population. Make requirements for entry into nursing school harder. Your GPA might be 3.8, but the requirements are college algebra, chemistry and biology 101, etc (for a BSN). The population of people that make up nursing isn't exposed public communication, research or scrutinizing data. More than that, students are accepted into the nursing field without any expectation of gaining or furthering the aforementioned skills. This book was difficult to read."
3,From Silence to Voice: What Nurses Know and Must Communicate to the Public,"Because the authors are not nurses, they cannot fully communicate to nurses in a manner that nurses will accept and understand. However, they do bring up many good points and things for nurses to consider."
3,little pricey,"I usually use the other colorscience wands, this one does not last as long and was a little darker than expected probably better results if just used as a lip stain."
5,Excellent,"This is the best CD from Joaquin Sabina that I ever heard. In my collection I have many great albums from Sabina, like: ""El hombre del traje gris"", ""Esta boca es mia"", ""Hotel dulce Hotel"", ""Fisica y Quimica"", ""Yo, mi, me, contigo"" and others, but I consider this is the best. If you would like hear an excellent singer and exceptional poet, you must buy this album. Sabina has a singular manner to say his feeling. He has talent to touch our life."
3,Una lastima de voz,"Sin duda ninguna grandes letras, terrible lo que le ha pasado a su vos (eh! Sabina, ten cuidado con la nicotina). Bueno para quien solo quiera deleitarse con las letras , malo para quien quiera oir al Sabina de antes."
2,"Eh,Sabina, ten cuidado con la nicotina","It was almost 20 years ago that I got my first Sabina LP ""La Mandragora"" along with Javier Krahe and Alberto Pérez. That was an ""unplugged"" acoustic live record, full of humor and irony. Then it was the live double LP with Viceversa (just 15 years ago) and Sabina mixed the wit of his lyrics with an electric band.That was one of the best ever made Spanish R&R records. He kept on working, releasing one record a year, adopting every possible musical style(bolero,rap,pasodoble...) and consuming his voice. Now, he hardly sings and it is almost painful when you listen to him. He's still a great song writer but he's been imitating himself for quite a long time. Anyway, there's always a couple of good songs in any of his records."
4,Su mejor obra,"Encontre a Joaquin ya tarde, despues de haber encontrado a Ricardo. Lastima, esta mucho mejor. [Lo siento Ricardo, tal vez si divorcias vuelvas a escribir algo interesante.] Sus ultimas canciones tienen mas substancia y olor a cigarro que, contrariamente a otro comentador, va mejor con sus letras. Este disco tiene canciones universales y otras de pueblo (Joaquin es español). Un gallego vendiendose a los sudakas. Vale la pena pagar por el. Hombre, faltaba mas."
4,Great Intro to baby signing,This book was great to answer my basic questions...When to start? What signing will do for me and my daughter? It also has a good beginning dictionary. I will be getting another book to learn more signs but this one was a great start.
5,I love this book,It's small enough to stick in your diaper bag. Good starter book for parents. I put it top of my reading list for my workshops on baby sign language. Fun and easy read.
5,Easy to Navigate/Real ASL/Everyday Useful-Fun Signs,"Perfect for the parents who want to teach their BABY sign language. There are 60 American Sign Language signs, in alphabetical order at the back of the book. These signs range from everyday objects to commands to fun things your baby is interested in, such as animals and toys. I highly recommend it. Compact... fits easily in purse or diaper bag. I'd give it more stars if I could!"
3,ok,"not what I expected. I just expected a different content, I got one for my Daughter-in-law. I am hopeful she enjoyed it."
4,all the basics,"Baby sign language basics fulfills its title admirably and, for someone relatively new to the topic, like me, is a good place to start. The broad areas covered include>>about baby sign language>>getting started>>now you're signing>>signing for fun>>photographs of 60 signswith just enough information to answer your questions. The style of writing is upbeat and enthusiastic on the topic and has some good ideas for including signing as part of your interaction with your baby, including the words (and when to sign) to several nursery rhymes which I'd forgotten. Be aware, that although this book has 333 pages, take note of the dimensions 0.98 x 4.34 x 4.30 (inches) - it's pretty small (apparently so it can fit in your diaper/nappy bag). Overall, worth the price for it's intended audience."
5,Whoa ...That was simply amazing!,This cd certainly takes a different approach than the wet or black albums but certainly gets the job done in a very well rounded manner. The first cd is very good but the second is incredible. You will be entertained by the mind numbing beats for a very long time. It also helps if you have a set of 12'JBL sub's because most conventional speakers don't do it justice but as long you can get a hold of this journey in a box you will be pleasently surprised! This is a top notch piece of work and should be enjoyed by anyone who likes pulsating bass and rythem because it is well worth the price...especially considering how much it would cost to travel to England to purchase such magnificent work!;)
3,How he does it.,"Those who know of Steve Reich and his music will find this DVD enlightening for a number of reasons: We hear him interviewed, get a sense of how he creates his art, and see him interact with other musicians. Steven Reich's music is easily accessible especially when compared with other ""modern"" composers (Cage, Boulez, Stockhausen, etc).His techniques of phasing, repetition, gradual changes in chordal structure,with a steady rhymic foundation are well understood through this video. ""City Life"" is the composition featured here and we see how he takes samples of common street sounds and enfolds them into the music.One unusual moment comes when he describes sampling sounds from a New York City Fire Department during the ""World Trade Center Attack"". When you remember that this DVD was made in 1996 you realize that this was not 9/11 but the first bombing of the WTC."
5,lovely excess,"excellent narrative of harrowing fuzzy drug fuelled excess, makes one want to never leave the heavenly glow of the opiate mind state. Or perhaps review ones own circumstances.great read for those who know the gift of the gab or who want to know what its all about. a true survivor who says it as it is, have to read his other books now."
2,Dean More E Arty,Yet another book about the trials and tribulations of life as a junky. Young Mr. O'Neill's writing is about as dull as the supposed needles he uses. I don't know if this was cathartic for him or if he actually thought this was interesting. This book is about as insightful and enlightening as a can of soup.
5,So-o helpful,"As a geology student, I found this book was needed every day. My professors recommended it to me and I needed it while reading textbooks and articles and studying for tests. I couldn't have made it without this book."
3,A bit of a let down,"This dictionary perfoms well for the beginner in geology or the intermediate student. Granted, most technical jargon is defined, though sometimes the definitions are a bit questionable. There is, however, some advanced and basic terminology that is absent. I sold my old geology dictionary (sorry, I didn't write anything about it down) and bought this one, and I regret doing so."
5,This is a great dictionary,"My boss wanted books that gave definitions and explainations of terms and processes used in oil and gas exploration and extraction, and loves this book."
5,Best in the Discipline,"This is an indispensable reference for professional geologists as well as amateurs. Some terms that have fallen out of use are defined with obsolete concepts, but those do turn up every now and then in both amateur and professional contexts. No doubt it needs to be revised soon. However, most of us have a copy and many of us need it."
2,Not for professionals or advanced students,"This Dictionary may be adequate for earth science educators or amateur enthusiasts, but not for more advanced users. Some terms are out of date or inadequately defined, and many more technical terms are not included. My third year Geology undergraduate students and fellow graduate students found it insufficient."
4,good basic dictionary,"This is a good basic dictionary. It's not meant to be comprehensive, but covers the basics quite well. It was a required text in my undergraduate studies, and it serves nicely at that level."
3,Wonderful until the last chapter,"Well written book that helped me put my wedding day into perspective...until the final chapter, in which the author paints a picture of a ""simply beautiful wedding"". It's so ""simply beautiful"" that it makes you feel bad if your life or situation isn't just like it....it's a little sickening to read, in fact.I'd buy the book for someone but rip out the last chapter so they wouldn't have to endure it."
1,Didn't work on a new Mac book,"Had to return the product, sporadic black screen and graphics did not display properly although the sound works ok. Even with tech support we could not get this software to work properly."
2,"Great idea, flawed execution (This review applies to single player only)","I enjoyed Jedi Outcast, so I bought this as well.The various features they added to the game are welcome additions, but the frame rate in this game is simply terrible. I have a fairly high end mac setup (Dual G5) with plenty of memory, I toyed with the video and sound settings, I downloaded the patch, but my frame rate is probably around 15-20 fps. Any time I switch weapons or kill someone I get noticable chop.I don't know what engine changes they made, but Jedi Academy definitely does not play as well as Jedi Outcast.Of the levels that I have played, I think the level design is a little weak. Between this and the frame rate, it is doubtful that I will even bother finishing it."
4,very nice,Well... This is the most you can get by Schumann...I am not an expert! Maybe you know more than me.
1,daffy cinema tee,They were out of this shirt but still received pants which doesn't have a shirt to go with it.
3,Brief introduction to policymaking,"Meier's book skims over policymaking in the bureaucracy and focuses mainly on the federal bureaucracy. This slim volume has good examples but one would hope for more depth considering the book's hefty price. In addition, the author's liberal slant can be a bit distracting. However, it does present some interesting ideas for public policy students to consider."
5,Beautiful scholarship,This is a well written document that brings together a number of the world's most important spiritual traditions.
4,Screwz-all screws some,"Well, the hinge is stiff (a good thing). When the unit is all folded together, it will not unfold in your pocket. I don't know how long the friction on the hinge will last as I have not used it alot. It is very handy to have around though when you do not have access to tools. Only gripe is the large phillips is a tad too large for normal phillips screws."
1,Not worth a penny.,"Before watching this video, my son (20 months old) would not share with his sister or cousins. After watching this video, I have more problems. Now my son grabs everything and says MINE!!!! He never said this before watching this video. He does not understand that this is the behavior you do not want to do. He says MINE regarding anything and everything he touches."
3,not what i expected,"my two year old daughter does enjoy this video, and requests to watch it often, however, i would have liked it to be more of a fictional video about sharing rather than commentary and direction from katie couric."
2,It's ok.,"The 1st 2/3 of this book was annoying for me. The heroine, Clea, was just too flighty, spoiled and a real b-----. Sorry, no other way to put it. I just couldn't relate to her. She's too used to having money and getting exactly what she wants. She's supposed to be saving money, but states she just spent $2000 on a new pair of boots, she wears a fox vest and actually packs her cosmetics bag in her saddle bags. Oh, and heaven forbid she breaks a nail within hours of arriving at her new home. I guess I just didn't see the point in all this. By the last 1/3 of the book she's suddenly become a ""normal"" person who's more down to earth. But I have to say it was really touch-and-go there for awhile whether I would continue reading the book. I really wanted to just give up and put it in my give to the Goodwill pile.I can't really recommend this book. Her other Montana books were better...Montana Blue is still the best."
1,Overpriced!,"When I ran out of the wax guard sheet that came with my E2Cs, I foolishly thought Shure would send a new sheet of wax guards - essentially a tiny sheet of 10 stickers - at virtually no cost. While Amazon sells these at a cheaper price than some other outlets, I would still baulk at paying anything over a couple of dollars for these.I am going to take the suggestion of the previous reviewer and simply manage without wax guards from now on. If that doesn't work then I may even have to consider replacing, what are excellent headphones, with a pair that doesn't call for wax guards."
3,"Good God, what have I gotten into?","I did get some information from this book, but basicly it wasway over my head."
5,Pocketing pocket books,"I remember reading this book in my early 20's. The story made think that this book should have been a episode of the orignal series. Too bad all the networks thought the show was unworkable. It was and still is a great read, it reminds you that you have to be your own person despite what family or even society thinks you should be or do.The story line shows n what you tried to hide, it will never stay hidden for very long. It's best to deal with the problem befor it come to deal with you."
3,The authors make more space for disinheriting.,"This is one of those Star Trek novels which is written by an ensemble of writers. An ensemble writing team is a key factor in a novel's downfall UNLESS the authors are each writing a different storyline.This becomes apparent through the errors on pages 35 and 68.Otherwise, the Disinherited is a typical Star Trek novel."
2,Would be better if interesting,"The story told in this book is rather dull and boring. I had hoped for much better. It also failed one of my major criteria for a novel; it was never edited. At various points throughout the book Sulu is refered to as the navigator or helmsman. On particular scene has Uhura, seeing Chekov look at her, ponder about the navigator. The very next paragraph she is now ponder about the navigator (Sulu). Very annoying. In order to make this book more enjoyable I found myself visualizing very colorful ""sign language"" by various character. Sign language plays an important part in the story.Overall, I was very disappointed in this book."
1,Does not work as advertised,"I bought this to use on 3 portable DVD players that my familly uses as well as other electronics(was hoping it would work on a digital camera, radio, and other stuff), BUT, it would not power any of the electronics I tried.None of the DVD players would power and the Digital Camera would power, but not be usable from to low of a current.I am sorry, but I am very dissapointed in this device and think they that they need to definitly improve on it to make it compatiably with more stuff!"
1,Problems with charging,"I was headed on a long trip and bought this battery so I could use a DVD player for a big portion of the travel. Unfortunately, after the initial charge, I could not get it to charge again. I called the manufacturer, and while the battery is under warranty, I have to pay to ship it to the manufacturer and also include a check for return shipping.In short: money wasted."
4,Good...but one small thing...,"I won't go into a detailed review here as those above have covered it quite well and I don't want to end up repeating what was said,but there was one small problem I did have...in the magic items second set items from the MMORPG were mentioned...but strangely enough not all the basic suits were covered. Where is the Dreadmist,the Wildheart,etc. Even the tier I epics are not covered (which I can accept that one),but the other zero tier's should have also been there. But again this is a small problem in what is otherwise an excellent book."
5,"A retired polka musician from Port Richmond, Phila.","I grew up 3rd generation in a Polish community & have played polka music. I have never read a book that I could relate to more than this & I felt it was personally written for me. As I was familiar with the foods,customs,songs,musicians mentioned,& the highs felt when cutting a good polka sound, I was astounded at the background research that was done by this author. I give a big ""ditto"" to the previous review from a ""Slav from Cleveland. Besides being a ""must read"" for anyone with my kind of background,it is simply a very good story."
4,i've also got the stinky ashtray,"i've got the smokes, you've got the feet let's make lots of buuurrrnnn marks......."
4,Best Band in Charleston,"I have been listening to this band for quite a while and have seen them live several times. There just isn't a better ""bar/cover"" band anywhere.This is a collection of originals that deserves to be heard by the masses. Just good, fun rock'n roll to party to. Please support local bands!!"
3,pole broke,The rainfly pole broke the first time I set this up. I am still figuring out if Amazon or Coleman should send me the replacement. It is a good deal for the price.
3,Good tent,Ordered the tent and it arrived perfectly on time. I took it out and set it up in my backyard. The tent is big which I like. I used it for a few summers and it held up well till one day a wind came through and broke some of the poles. I would use it for light weather outings and some rain but no where with a lot of wind.
5,Best Large Tent for the Price,"I have used this tent, and I think it's a very good tent. Solid. It's pretty easy to set-up, and the instructions on Amazon are pretty accurate. It's just so large. For the price--there is no tent with this size footprint on the market.I have read the other reviews, and am a bit surprised. I didn't have any problems with zippers, rain fly, etc... Everything worked perfectly well, and to be honest I expect to have this tent for years to come.In sum, this is a great family tent. Sturdy, great size, easy to set up, and Coleman. One of the most trusted brands in family camping. And for this price, it's an absurd deal. I got this for 50% less than any other place."
4,Large tent/one person set up,"I bought this tent and used it right away. It was easy to set up alone, and was plenty big. Might be alittle crowded for 5 people though. During a wind gust one rainfly pole broke, but Coleman sent me a new one immediately, and free of charge. Coleman was a good choice for a camping tent."
4,Recommended for campers on a budget,"Highly recommended, functional and practical and cost effective nonetheless. Only exception, storage bag was flimsy (strap was unable to handle the weight of the tent)."
3,It's OK...,"It's just OK - nothing great or interesting. The author took every day of the year and wrote a 1-2 page overview of the crime that either took place on that day or a criminal was executed on that day or a criminal was caught on that day. You get the picture. If you've read every true crime book on the planet and are looking for something new - go ahead and buy it. Otherwise, just pick up a really good true crime book and reread it."
1,What the heck?!,"What on earth is the purpose and/or message of this film? And what kind of audience was it made for? Since it seems to have been a TV mini-series at some point and is thoroughly unexciting, my guess is it was intended for small children.Don't waste your money on this!"
5,Category 6 - Day of Destruction,I recieved it on time and and it was in excelent contions.I will tell everyone where I got it and tell them it is a very good place to shop!
2,Too Much Filler,"This thing just runs way too long. I suspect that one could remove the myriad of unrelated subplots and get the central theme of the movie well within a 90 minute runtime. It has it's moments. Tornado Tommy is fun to watch, and I think if they'd centered the movie around his character it would have been a lot more enjoyable. The special effects range from good to really terrible.In the end what kept me from being able to watch this thing all the way through was the ridiculous number of unnecessary subplots featuring interpersonal drama among a bunch of unlikable characters.I want to like an epic length feature with tornadoes, but I really can't recommend it."
5,Excellent Movie of Nature's Wrath,"I really enjoyed this movie. I though the acting was great, and the story very touching, exciting, scary, and sad at the same time. The acting is great in my opinion. The story is set mostly in Chicago, and surrounds terrible storms, tornados, hurricanes, and severe thunder storms. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of these types of movies. The only negative thing I can say is they did not do a very good job of piecing together the movie - it was originally a made for TV movie, and that is apparent as the cut-offs to commercials are still there. Regardless, this is a great movie and about a topic that should be on all of our minds."
5,Outstanding Movie,"This movie is outstanding. Must see for anyone that enjoys watching storm type movies. I would not recommend for younger audiences. In my opinion it would be to disturbing for younger people. I believe in global warming and if you look around and do research on it, it is real. If anything like this movie ever happens to us God bless the United States. I can also recommend Catagory 7."
3,I love natural disaster movies,This is a made for TV movie and maybe not one of the better ones but for me it was a good way to spend a Sunday night curled up with a bowl of popcorn.
4,Great Inside Joke.,"This is a fun film. Stretched out, yes. Stock footaqe, yes. But hey - there are worse ways to spend 3 hours. Turn off your brain and enjoy. I'm really writing this to applaud an inside joke. The storm warning center intern's name is Sabrina Rogers - the name of the character played by Lena Horne in the film ""Stormy Weather"". ""Don't know why ain't no sun up in the sky......""Bravo!"
4,OUTSTANDING TORNADIC MELODRAMA!!!!,"THIS FILM IS GREAT FOR SPECIAL FX!!!! I STUDY SUPERCELL THUNDERSTORMS AND TORNADOES!!!! THIS FILM IS RIGHT UP MY ALLEY!!!! YOU MIGHT EVEN CALL ""THE PERFECT MIDWESTERN STORM!!!!""SINCE SUPERCELLS ARE PRIMARILY THE CATALYSTS OF TORNADO ALLEY, AND THE MAIN PRODUCERS OF THE INTENSE VIOLENT TORNADOES THAT HIT THE GREAT PLAINS, MIDWEST AND SOUTH EVERY SPRING; I CAN SEE HOW THEY PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THIS FILM!!!! THE POWER OUTAGE SEQUENCES COULD ONLY LEAD TO CATASTROPHE!!!! WITHOUT WARNINGS OR SIRENS; CHICAGO WAS A SITTING DUCK!!!! (SIMILAR TO FORT SMITH, ARKANSAS IN 1996 WHEN AN ENORMOUS F-4 TORNADO STRUCK SHORTLY AFTER 1AM, SPAWNED FROM A LONG LIVED TORNADIC SUPERCELL THUNDERSTORM THAT CROSSED THE OKLAHOMA BORDER INTO ARKANSAS!!!! WHEN THE WARNING WAS ISSUED FROM TULSA....IT WAS TOO LATE!!!!A TORNADO HAD TAKEN OUT THE PHONE LINES!!!!)THIS FILM WAS GREAT!!!!"
5,Grrrrreat book!,"Superb, great book! . Starts with simple theory, it makes you think harder and harder and you progress into the deep science of adaptive signal processing and the implementation of filters with different algorithms, difficult themes are made easy and over all this is great reference book for the designer. I wish I could get a solution manual for a deeper and more reliable analysis. It will serve you well is you use Matlab to analyze and simulate complete Adaptive filters for equalization or so."
1,"Too ""sweet"" - it sticks","Larry O'Brien has currently (Fall 2004) got the band much sharper and with an edge nearer the 1941/2 sound but this CD is not it.The original Miller Band was always being accused of being ""sweet"" rather than ""swing"" or ""jazz"". Of course it wasn't but this CD is so sweet it it cloying and sickly.Give this one a miss and select from one of the many others on Amazon if you want to hear the Miller sound - because this ""ain't it""."
2,Disappointing Disney,"Although this game kept my 8 year-old daughter amused for a while, it's too simplistic to be really challenging. There is too much annoying and repetitive chatter from animated characters between levels in some of the games, and overall the games just aren't that interesting."
1,What a disappointment and waste of time!,"As a fan of any sort of fairy tale, I was unpleasantly surprised by this novel. The story stuck to the original plot, while adding very few creative touches or embellishments. The characters were very stereotypical and any attempt at realistic characterization seems to have failed. I found this story to be shallow and would recommend that fans of Beauty and the Beast retellings read Robin McKinley's ""Beauty"" or ""Rose Daughter."" Both were far superior. Unless the reader is an avid fan of cheap young adult romances, I would strongly discourage reading this book."
2,The Disney version...in paperback.,"Maybe if I had read this book ten years ago I would have been more inclined to like it.It seriously plays out exactly like the Disney version, minus the enchanted objects and songs, which would have helped me enjoy the book more.There are a couple of instances where the dialogue in the book is nearly the same as it is in the Disney movie.The only major plot change it the era during which the story takes place. It was nice that Jennifer Baker tried to modernize it. However, it's probably time to come out with a second edition or something. The book was written in 1996, yet she doesn't even mention the Internet. The Beast clearly could have been IMing away his sorrows via AOL 3.0."
5,Beauty and the Beast modernized!,"I loved this book. I thought it was very creative in turning the plot into a sort of modern story. When I started it I thought it was rather boring but after I was about 40 pages into it I couldn't stop! I loved Peter's ""dream machine"". I think this is a wonderful book and that anyone who enjoys fairy tales and romance should read it."
3,A Beast or a Kitten?,"Despite the authors attempts, this book didn't catch my attention as much as the original. Don't get me wrong, as a very young budding author myself I appreciate her efforts, but her words were mangled, and she didn't let her thoughts didn't bloom completly. I like the book, but it isn't very high on my scale of favorite books. If you want a book that will keep you in a cloud of thoughts about love, then this might work, but it definetly isn't the best. No offense Jennifer."
3,Hmmmmmmmmm.....................,"WellIt was pretty good, but it just wasn't quit there. It had all the elements for a good story but all the strangeness to it clashed with the good stuff. You would be sitting there enjoying the feeling of compleate sadness for the Beast and suddenly he was like in his little ""Dream Machine"". It was just sort of AbstractBut I guess I'm to attached to the old times kinda, versions betterbut all in all it was worth reading"
2,Watch For Kids With Sensitive Skin,"I rate this one low because it only works on 1/3 of the kids in my household. This sunscreen smells great and goes on easy but two of my three children broke out after using it. The one who didn't have any problems uses it just fine and it's effective and stays on well during water play so if you're fortunate enough to have kids like my middle kiddo with no sensitivity issues, this would be a great sunscreen and for them, I'd say it rated 4 stars. I wish there were better sunscreen products for kids with sensitive skin on the market, I've found this problem with many major product brands."
5,WOW! What a resource!,"This book will knock your socks off! Janet has done an excellent job of walking the reader ""step-by-step"" through some amazing technology integration activities. So much is simple and fits in perfectly with an already tight classroom schedule. She definitly supports the concept that technology is the tool and not the target. AND she has another workbook ""AppleWorkshop for Students""! I got 'em both!"
4,Lab manual,"If you don't have a CD, don't buy it. Maybe with the lab CD is good, but without it won't be any help for you. Especially I bought it to teach Spanish and it was useless for me."
3,it's okay,"This isn't as good as the WOW 1998, and WOW 1999 videos, but it's alright. Not all of the songs are great, and some of the videos are, well, kinda stupid for Christian Groups. My favorite songs on the video are by the groups: dc Talk, Big Tent Revival, Steven Curtis Chapman, Newsboys, Geoff Moore & The Distance, and Reality Check. The only thing I don't really like about the group Reality Check, is that they are obviously ""dc Talk"" wannabe's!!!! It's so funny how obvious they are trying to be like dc Talk, that you can't even concentrate on the song and the lyrics. It was kind of a dissapointment that I payed so much for this movie, if you want my opinion, (buy the WOW videos)"
4,One of the top gay genre novels!,"Billed as ""the first gay gothic novel"" in the Advocate, this book opened to my thirteen year old mind, the possiblity that gay life existed beyond the parks & bars. The novel follows the travails of Robert, a young orphan, who is invited to the Gaywick estate to be employed as a librarian. Upon arriving he is soon caught up in the intrigues of the estate's residents. Beyond the basics of a gothic novel, the story acts as a primer for classics and art, giving the reader an insight into turn of the century New York. It is possible that this book written before the onset of AIDS, is one of the final glimpses of the optimism that was part of the early gay movement."
4,Jane Eyre was a tougher cookie...,"This gay gothic romance entertains, but also suffers from the overheated sensibilities and language of most romance novels, almost sickeningly so. The ""hero"" bursts into tears on almost every page, which made me want to slap him heartily, and some of the ""camp"" elements are a bit tough to swallow (no pun intended). Despite these carpings, it's a fun and refreshing alternative look at a cliche-encrusted genre."
3,Guilty pleasures,"Gaywyck is enormously entertaining. It's every gay guy's fantasy of meeting a handsome, rich and eligible man. It might have been written by an Oxford don who's secretly read 'Gone with the Wind', 'Jane Eyre' and 'Rebecca' under the bedclothes with a flashlight. Trash at its best."
2,Maybe only for a collectible,"Maybe you would only keep this book as a collectible. The story itself bored me. It felt like Virga originally wrote this book with a man and a woman then just went back and touched up the main character, Robert Whyte, and made him a man so that he could make a gay gothic romance. Maybe he was originally Roberta Whyte. He was so feminine and so frail it made me want to puke at times. I got about 3/4's through the book and then I decided I had just had enough. Maybe if you are into extremely feminine men you'll like. I gave it 2 stars because the idea is original and it does take talent to write a book."
2,Lord Donough,"I was not impresed by this.It was one of the least apealing books I have read.I was just disapointed I guess.I did like a few scenes.I even liked the suporting characters better,but all in the whole.Not a great book."
5,Convincing evidence that God knows and cares about you!,"An autobiographical record of God's miraculous interventions in this evangelist's life. If you ever doubted whether God could know you, love you, and care about your day-to-day challenges, this book will end your doubts. God worked in miraculous ways in Ken Gaub's life and the message is He will work miracles in all His children's lives. Poweful for all age groups."
1,"No way, Jose, can you see","There is a certain dimension of ironic cleverness that we have a right to expect from soi-disant language writers, but lacking here is that joie de vivre that enlivens language. I'm afraid that a gust of Guest, blowing hard, won't do much more than huff and puff."
4,A great album,"A great great album, with passages of the best Beach Boys' ""pet sounds"" and Beatles psichodelia ""Rubber soul"", ""Revolver"" and ""Sgt Pepper"". They are the best latin-rock voices I've ever heard. It would be a classic album in latin rock"
4,"Christian Men, you Need this book.","Christian men, whether you are well on your journey as a solid Christian Man or know you are one who really needs to make some changes in your life, this book will give you many pointers for improving your Godliness, Holiness, and just general Spiritual wellbeing. If Christian men will read this book with the intent to take action, the world will soon be a MUCH better place. Are you man enough?"
5,Very Helpful to Me Personally,"R. Kent Hughes pastored College Church in Wheaton, Illinois for many years. He encourages men of God to be disciplined so that they can grow in holiness toward God. He talks about the discipline of purity, taking steps to make sure that you are reading or reflecting on immoral materials or watching sensual TV programs.There is a chapter on the discipline of marriage, continuing to court your wife after marriage and to love her and cherish her as Christ does the church.He also discusses the discipline of the mind and challenges men to read at least a few books a year in addition to the Bible.There is also a chapter on the discipline of parenting and the discipline of friendship, and a number of others. The book will feed your faith and starve your doubts and make you want to get closer to God."
3,Good basic info - but...,"R. Kent Hughes provides men with some good solid Christian fundamentals to live by. I thought the reading was relatively easy and provided many points of discussion with my small group.However - some of the negatives about the book revolve around the terrible examples used by Hughes as ""fact"". One example would be the lesson on ""tongues"" and his assumption that a mid-western reporter caused a revolution in China... This is hardly the case - but written to be as fact in his book. Furthermore - Hughes tends to utilize statistics as a measure to re-inforce his points. Unfortunately - much of his data is now quite dated and seems rather silly to utilize in reinforcing his points. In this day and age when politicians are quoting the latest poll - it seems rather bitter-sweet to find a Christian writer using polls to complicate his message.Overall - the book is good basic info - but there are other books that will provide more punch for the paper."
4,solid ....great path to follow,"If you want to lead a stronger, healthier, and more giving life...... you should definitely read this book. The right plan forward."
5,Great intro for being a godly man!,"This book hits on so many facets of living the godly life that it amazes me. Every chapter hits on something that all men have as weaknesses in some way and challenges to break out of the weakness by giving advice as well. More importantly, the book is biblically based, which is always good. Overall, a very exhorting book!"
4,Bittersweet!,"The first 50 minutes of this documentary are sheer agony, as the Sox' historic failures are recapped in excruciating, repetitive detail. During the final, triumphant 10 minutes of the program the tears will stream from your face."
5,for Boston and baseball fans,"This summer my husband took my 12-year-old to Boston for Red Sox/Yankee games at Fenway. This video was a must. We all thoroughly enjoyed it - my husband, a lifelong baseball fan, my daughter, who is beginning to follow in her father's footsteps, and me, a more casual fan. It contains the entire program of the original ""Curse of the Great Bambino"" with additional interviews added in after Boston won the World Series and broke the curse. Although big Boston fans probably won't learn anything new, the interviews, the despair of the long-suffering Boston fans and the history of the team are well-worth the watch. The same fans are interviewed after the Series. The interviews include discussions of The Curse with die-hard fans and baseball historians giving varied opinions on its existence. The entire documentary is a real treat for baseball fans, nostalgists and those who love the history of the game as a whole."
4,Very good!,"We have enjoyed this DVD over and over again. It is, in our opinion, much more interesting and better edited than the ""Faith Rewarded"" Red Sox DVD (which has a really annoying voice-over). According my husband , who is a long-time follower of the Red Sox, Reverse the Curse really taps into the heart of what it means to be a (long-tortured!) Red Sox fan."
3,Rverse of the Curse of the Bambino,"This DVD of the history of the Red Sox - Yankee rivalry, the greatest rivalry in sports, and covers a lot in an hour. It's worth the purchase if you're a fan of either team and is a good gift to a child or someone who is just learing about baseball. There is great footage but nothing new, and that's what lowers the rating for me. I just wanted more. There wasn't enough about the greatest comeback in baseball history: the Sox beating the Yanks in the 2004 ALCS. The DVD just isn't quite enough. It falls a little short for a rabid fan, but is likely fine for all others."
3,"Judy Christenberry is awesome, but this story falls short!",This book just didn't have a story that caught my attention.I have read *ALL* of Judy Christenberry's books.This is one of the few that fell short of a good book as faras I am concerned.I didn't care for the characters.The guy was a jerk.The woman didn't inspire sympathy.I tried to get into the story.I love Mrs. Christenberry's books centered in Cactusbecause you come to care for the characters and the humor she adds.This book just feel short of that.
3,Doesn't feel quite right for an X-Men story...,"And is very dramatic, soap-opera dramatic actually. However, the by the time I finished reading this it gave me goosebumps and I genuinely felt sad. Nothing original, but the best executed Austen idea in his run on Uncanny X-Men. And the art is gorgeous, as usual."
3,great storyline,"potential for really great book but it never quite got there. Turned out to be pretty standard fare.The characters however were really great that I wish they had been more developed. The only part of the book which I thoroughly disliked was that after ""freddy"" was raped, her new husband Rand sought to ""cure"" her by persisting in his wedding night. None of that dialogue reflected any understanding of how to treat a rape victim. shame on you, ms johnston."
1,NOT WORTH IT,"Sure,the girls are sexy,(because their brazilian) but they never really get to get actually ""playing"" a round of volleyball or baseball,they just go thru a series of exercises,and practice warm-ups.its also disappointing that each DVD is only 45 mins long,and only have 3 girls in each video.And I KNOW its called ""TOPLESS"" blah,blah, but I'd rather they be totally naked instead of just topless."
4,Great tool for the cost.,Seemed to be good quality for the Price. I would purchase more of this brand if I need additional sizes.
3,it's pretty good,"saw this video in part 1 the other night&it had some decent comedy.Kim Coles was very funny.it was cool catchng John Witherspoon on here.this video had a younger Chris Rock. hit&miss for the most part,but entertaining."
2,blah!,I am a huge Sarah fan and I just can't listen to this. It is so slow. It is missing the upbeat powerful lyrics and music from her previous releases. I would not recomend anyone purchasing this.
1,Blatant rip-off,"Wow. Anyone who enjoyed this book might want to read Ava, by Carole Maso, whose style Jenny Boully has ripped off verbatim. Boully in fact reveals her familiarity with Maso's writing by making reference to her on page 35 of this book. Maso is an underread but brilliant avant-garde writer who deserves to be read by many but does not deserve this kind of injustice. Please don't support dishonest authors who feel the need to steal from others."
1,gatling gun,the company TIMELESS MEDIA GROUP that reproduced this movie wanted to make a quick buck. the picture quality is rotten and the audio is worse. sometimes you cant understand what is being said. they have inserted a TMG icon several times in the movie. the only reason i gave this 1 star is because you couldnt rate it a lower rating. also you cant jump to the list of cast. i would not spend any money on a dvd from TIMELESS MEDIA GROUP.
3,Cowboys Versus Indians,"This isn't the best Western I've seen, but it shows a lot of Indians getting killed by the gatling gun, so if you like rooting for Indians, you'll be disappointed. The movie just shows a band of people transporting the gun through Indian territory. It just so happens the gun doesn't operate when it's missing a working part, so I guess this is suppose to show that the men is vulnerable to attack, when without their deadly weapon. The movie ends abruptly, making you wonder what was the plot to begin with after all. I have no complaint of the quality of video or audio, it's not the best, but doesn't take away from viewing pleasure."
3,It's OK,It works as advertised but is a little pricey for what it is. Be careful if your lens is >67mm diameter. The hole in the neoprene face needs to be enlarged for any lens >~55mm dia so there's little material left after fitting to a larger diameter lens.
4,My urban exploration third-hand,"When wearing my camera and exploring old buildings and the like, the camera swings. When I jump across gaps or swing around railings, it sways and bounces, and bangs into things. Keeping it in a pack would help, but I'd miss a lot of photo ops. So now I use this strap. It's basically neoprene with a strap. Simple, and does the job. I've used it with my 8mm fisheye, 70-200 zoom, 60mm, 17-85 mm and more. Works fine and stretches to fit all my lenses. I tend to wear it closer to my chest then belly (as pictured), plus at chest height it's easier to avoid obstacles.It looks really silly - and you'll often have to remove it to use your camera (just slip the neoprene over the lens) - but the stability it adds is well worth it.Now when I jump, climb and crawl, I can use both hands - instead of keeping one hand on the camera."
1,Not a manual but a brochure,I'm returning this book as this is more like a brochure advertising this special 'patented' technique. I understand you can't learn this type of thing from a book but still i would like to see the actual techniques in there. Its just advertising for this special 'patented' technique which i'm not going to waste anymore money on.
1,ART book is a fraud,I read this book and it gives no information about how do you do this technique. I have been to numerous frauds for my soft tissue problems and this book adds to my list. In fact it gives a bad startto someone who may want to get ART done on them. Sometimes people want to make a quick buck by writing a book in the hopes that some sucker will fall for it!
2,Somewhat misleading title,"I have to agree with some of my precedessors here, the book is a well-written brochure that stops short of explaining how to actually treat RSI. While I am fully aware that you can not learn such a technique from a book, it would be helpful if the author had gone more into detail in regards to pressure points etc.On the other hand the book offers a decent overview over the most common RSI's and how they occur, which can be helpful if someone is just starting out in the field. The exercise setion is probaly the most useful part of the book/However, I feel most people would get more out of a book on trigger point massage such as Donna Finados: Trigger Point self care manual"" if your goal is actual pain relief."
2,false advertising,"I thought from the title of this book that it would be like a synopsis of how to do the ART technique. Instead, most of it was info about how wonderful ART is with some useful information about injuries in general. It does inform about specific anatomy but I didn't really need that part, although it was nice. I just wanted to know how to use the techniques, and I was a bit disappointed."
1,wast of money,This book spends page after page telling you about a great method for pain release without giving you one bit of usable information.
4,Slightly baffled,"I have to admit that I am somewhat baffled by those reviewing the book who are irritated by the fact that they were not ""taught"" by the book how to perform ART.Would you purchase a book on orthopedic assessments and assume that by merely reading the book you would be knowledgeable enough at that point to [...] your injury state? People go toschool for years to learn the anatomy and physiology of the body to be able to fully UNDERSTAND and visualize the underlying tissues. This book is an explanation as to the process andreasons for ART, not to teach you how to do it on yourself. Be wise. Would you set your own fracture after doing a google search on how to do it? See a professional for the work, make yourself knowledgeable by reading about why it helps."
5,Great Book,"This book lead gave me the solution I needed. ART has helped me resolve my CTS. This book is a wonderful resource for anyone. I give this book top marks, thank you for writing it."
1,Release your pain,I never recieved the right order so I can't tell you wether I liked the book or not. You all keep sending me the wrong books and now I have three of the same ones............
3,Silly,"I enjoyed the first book, but I found the second book used multiple mixed metaphors and superfluous silly similes which took away from the story."
5,Better than the first and keeps on going...,"Wow...I use to say that writing in books don't do justice to living through events. But in this book I find I want to live these words and in this world. Realationships in this world make more sense they are easier. Kissing and Love this man has these themes down to a ""T"". Perfect from cover to cover. Just The right amount of humor. I couldn't put it down and I tried. I am so impressed with the writing that I'm learning french in order to reread the first two books and get the second two before they make it to the us translation."
3,Scholars beware,"I ordered this edition as a text for a graduate school course I am taking. When I received the text, I learned that it is not the complete work. The complete text includes a narrative frame, two short stories and a novella. This edition contains only the frame and one of the stories. This fact is not obvious from the title unless one is very familiar to with the original text. It also makes the cover price seem extravagant. Even if the title or description had mentioned that this was a ""volume one,"" I would have been better informed. If you need or want the complete text, spent the extra money and buy the Edinburgh hardcover edition. If you are buying the text for pleasure reading, this is still a good purchase."
3,depends on what you're looking for,"If you're looking for soft europop with an Americanized feel, then this album might appeal to you (although you don't need to go to the Balkans to get boatloads of that). If you're looking for more of a ""world music"" disc, then this may underwhlem you.I was initially drawn to the album from an NPR review that characterized it as a clever mixture of ethnic yugoslavian music overlaid with a dance beat. And, indeed, the one cut that appears on the charity disc entitled ""Balkans without borders"" actually fits the bill. However, the majority of ""Balkan Tribes"", in my opinion, is too westernized and not very characteristic. Its easy to listen to, but doesn't reach out and grab you."
4,The World Series the Yankees SHOULD have won...,"Being a Yankees fan, it always baffles me that the Yankees lost the World Series of 2001. If there ever, EVER was a year they deserved to win, 2001 was it.I enjoyed the footage of the series as well as the interviews with the team and the family members who were impacted by the series. This documentary will make you laugh and cry. Above all, it will make you remember..."
5,I Still Get Tears In My Eyes...,"First of all, I am not a Yankees fan, nor am I a Yankees hater.This film, although a wee bit heavy handed at times, still brings tears to my eyes...five years since 9/11. It is wonderful to see how a simple game of baseball helped in a small way heal a devastated city and country.What I liked is that it did not focus on the terrorists or the attack as so much as the healing. It was a film about resolve, not vengeance.The interviews with the families of the victims were prominently featured, as they should. The ballplayer interviews were to add to the feeling, but the film clearly focused on the famlilies. This ensured that the viewer knew what was truly important.Although as an Oakland A's fan, I get to relive the moment when Jeremy Giambi should have slid over and over again, I love that I have this in my DVD collection.*note - as a DVD there are no special features...it's the documentary and that's it..."
5,"Touching, amusing and poignant.","This is a great DVD for Yankee's fans, and the ties to the horrors of 9/11 on the city of New York are what make this a great DVD. I would recommend this to anyone who still believes in the power of baseball and the human heart."
3,Random actors not needed,"I just couldn't get into this movie at first. I usually watch rental movies as soon as I get them, but it took me almost a week to sit still long enough to watch it. I LOVED the interviews with the real Tuskegee Airmen, but I couldn't figure out who the random shots of people in the background were (in color setups). Did the film hire actors to reenact what the Red Tails went through? I knew the black and white shots were them, but the extra actors just didn't make sense to me. I would've rather had seen black and white shots of each pilot they were talking about instead of the newer looking reenactments, and this happened through the whole film. After awhile, I just started listening to the pilots talk and stopped watching the movie altogether."
3,"Noisy, batteries stopped working","Very noisy and hot - I'm probably going to get rid of it because of that.I had a few weird electrical glitches within the first month or so, and reinstalled everything. That seemed to clear it up. But a few months ago, the connection to the batteries started having problems. The batteries would work fine for a bit, then suddenly the machine would lose all power and just die. The batteries were probably ok (they had little indicators on the side), so it seemed to be a connection.Actually, the original battery they included with the machine did die, so it was really just the 3rd party batteries that seemed ok."
3,Ideal Book for Beginners in Flash.,"I as was seeking for Advance Flash Movie Clip Image Scrollers, the one Explained was the normal flash built in Scrollers, and some files were found on Advance Scrolling Text, but was not explained. This book is Ideal for those who are beginning to learn Flash8 not for Advance users."
3,Arrived without CD,"Got the book today, a massive tome with close to 1300 pages. Sensible layout and plenty of illustrations where appropriate. Time will show if the content covers enough ground for me. Seems like I will have to do an awful lot of reading before I can tell for sure! ;-) However, the accompanying CD-ROM was missing. Perhaps not suprising, as there aren't any plastic pockets inside of the book to hold it, so I guess it was just put in there and fell out later during shipping. On their help pages, Amazon suggests that I contact the publisher about this issue, but in the book itself it says to not expect Wiley to replace any missing CD's. Anyway, I'll get a copy from a fellow student, so I won't pursue the matter."
5,Up LATE with FLASH 8,haven't finished it yet. but i hope to. this thing is packed with tons of helpful information and sparks my creative juices which i had thought were dry.
4,retrospective-herman's hermits,"This is finally a worthwhile compilation.Three caveats,however.While""Leaning on a Lamp Post"" may be the ""original""version.It is NOT the single version released in the U.S.A.Also,a number of the songs released here in mono,have been released in the U.K.on various compilations in true stereo.Thirdly,""Hold On!"" for some reason is presented without the lead guitar and sounds just plain strange without that overdub.With those three exceptions,this is the best currently available single disc from the Hermits."
2,"Awful Packaging, Excellent Sound","The Best of Herman's Hermits is all here, in very good sound, if Your'e a Fan already You will Dig what's here. However, those who are curious, and maybe know just the biggest Hits and wonder about the rest...Consider this: This is really Inane material, it makes N'Sync appear Sophisticated. The Big Cover versions(Wonderful World, Silhouettes) are criminally inferior, though I will take A Kind of Hush over the Carpenters Remake. Now to the Packaging..it is of the Digipak variety, meaning CHEAP cardboard, and the booklet is glued to the inside cover, so You can expect time to peel that away, meanwhile You will have trouble flipping through it...Peter Noone Has Squeezed 40 Years from the HERMAN Charicature, about 38 Years too long..."
3,Herman's Sounded Better,"I was disappointed with this CD. I had hopes it would sound great. It is certainly clean and pristine, however it sounds like the vocals are pushed back in the mix and the instruments are too loud. It's almost as if the vocals are out of phase and therefore, diminished. I compared many tracks to mp3's I downloaded during the Napster heyday and most of those have a better mix. I can't understand why this is. I expected it to be better."
5,Excellent,"The original/remastered sound retains the original feel of the music. Quality is excellent. The CD had all of the major pop hits plus some other good choices, e.g. ""It's Nice to Be Out in the Morning"" and ""My Sentimental Friend"".FYI: I've been a record collector and sometimes deejay since the 1950s."
4,Brian Low,"Most of the hits contain in the CD are my favourites in the early 70's. Quality wise and packing when receiving the goods are perfect. Even though this is my first order from Amazon, Iam fully satisfied with the service and updated information provided by the Amazon group. Iwould not hesitate to purcahse my next order in the near future."
2,Fun for all ages,I bought this game because I love Wallace and Grommit and the game looked really fun. It's a fun game with a bit of a challenge. Shortley after playing the game you are in a town and you have to find a lot of bunnies which is actually hard to do because your timed. This game isn't just for kids it's fun for all ages and you will feel like a kid again when you play it.
4,My dog does move better with this added to her water!,"Our dog is part Husky and Lab and is 11 years old. She was hit by a car at the age of 2. She was ok at the time, just scared everybody. I always wondered about the long term affect of her hip as she smashed in the driver's car door. She gets stiff with cold weather and rainy days but does alot better with the drops added to her water bowl. I give 18 drops to 1 gallon of water, everyday."
4,Great ab section,"I had been going to the gym a few times a week and doing crunches on my own, but whoa! The next day after I did this video I could feel it in my abs...for the Whole Day! Great Tape.I have her other video Totally Firm, but I like this one better."
5,A Denise Fan in TX,"This video is very challenging. The workout is long and somewhat strenuous, but it's a good step up from her TV workout show. The scenery is nice in the video, and as always, Denise has such a great attitude! It would have been nice if she would have devoted a little more time to toning exercises. It feels like you do a ton of aerobics and weight exercises, and then at the end she squeezes in some toning moves. Also, the music is sooooo old and boring. The music she plays on her TV workout shows is better than that! (""It's Raining Men"" and ""She Works Hard for the Money""? ) Other than that, this video is worthwhile."
3,good workout tape,"i bought this tape last night and tried it. it is pretty good. the workout targets everything from cardio to muscle toning to abs and thighs. i usually have to work out to a tape then switch to do abs, thighs, and buns seperately. the only thing that is annoying is her ""whoa!"" and ""you can do it""..she repeats it over and over! but the tape itself is good. lots of repetitons."
3,Disappointing,"This is not a workout for beginners, but for some reason, Ms. Austin thinks she needs to talk down to the viewer and encourage them to try to keep up. She constantly says things like ""Come on, you can do it, I believe in you."" Oh Please! Besides the non-stop chatter and poor sound quality of the video, I found that extremely annoying. And for someone who's been making aerobics videos for as long as she has, you'd think she'd learn to cue better. She hardly cues at all! Suddenly she just starts doing something else. Even the people who are doing the routines behind her have trouble keeping with her at times!There are better videos out there: the Jane Fonda series for one."
1,Horrible,"This video is a waste of money. The workout is not challenging and the music can't be heard because of Denise Austin's vapid and constant banter. The participants are not in sync and it seems to be more appropriate for titillating teen boys rather than a real challenge for those wishing to find a great workout.If you are looking for a challenging workout, get anything by Gin Miller on Reebock."
4,It works!,"I had been using this about 7 years ago to help me lose weight. I ended up losing 15 pounds in around 2 months, (without dieting AT ALL mind you). I did either this or Tae Bo about 6 times a week. Denise works the body cardio-wise, to burn calories, and strength-wise, to tone and tighten the body. It's sort of long and could get boring but I always had my own music playing in the background to help it go by faster. I've just recently begun using this tape again to switch up my workouts. I recommend it!"
2,Not for me!,"I bought this video because I had seen Denise Austin do her T.V. show and I thought that I would give one of her videos a try. I was highly disappointed! I felt as though she was making up the routine as she went along. She was not only way too happy, but she didn't seem to know what she was going to do next. However, the stomach section was good. I think I will stick to my Kathy Smith videos!"
4,replacement clippers,When I was in high school is the mid 60's we raised standard poodles. My mom ordered a set of Oster clippers. She used them for my years. Then I used them for our small poodle. Just this last week they finally died. Many years of great service and they were finally put to rest. I immediately got on line looking for their replacement. Imagine my surprise when I found the exact same clippers on Amazon ( Golden A5-2 Speed ). I ordered them and just received them in the mail. Fast delivery and I'm anxiously waiting to try them out on our Silky Terrier. They look just like the old ones now if only they deliver the same long time service.
1,Can't rate it highly if it won't even cut!,"One of our long-haired cats doesn't like to be touched, so her fur becomes matted. I bought this clipper to cut her mats out. Not only does it not cut the mats at all, it won't even cut unmatted hair! I oiled it as instructed, but no luck - all it does is vibrate. I returned it and am now in search of a REAL clipper."
1,Terrible product-Will not cut,"I bought this unit to cut the hair on my two shi-tzus. It didn't come with the right tool, so that was another expense. When I bought the tool, it didn't cut at all. I had to go back to the cheap unit. I'm very dissatisfied."
3,Clippers,"The clippers worked great at first. Now they will not cut any hair. I kept them oiled during use, not for sure what happened."
3,"Good clipper, high price",We have been using this clipper for several months. It is a quality clipper but could use a re-design as the ergonomics are lacking. The barrell of the unit is quite large and the ballance of the clipper could be improved. It definetly out performs the cheap clippers found in discount stores and is well built.
2,Where's the case?,"When I read the description of the item. It stated these clippers came with a case. NOPE, just a box."
5,A really excellent all-around clipper,"I've been clipping dogs, as pets and professionally, for over 40 years. I would probably still have my first Oster clippers if I had not sold them. Oster's just don't break down. I only groom our own dogs now and already had, and am still happy with, a smaller, one-speed Oster that I use on a miniature Schnauzer. When we adopted a much, much bigger dog with a very heavy coat, I needed more power and am very pleased with the Golden A5. It isn't too heavy, has great power and doesn't over heat."
4,"Worth the expense, but a lot of friction","This is my first experience with anything other than the $20 wahls from big box stores. However, I have been cutting my own hair for 12 and my dog's hair for 8 years. I have gone through a lot of clippers. These are loud and get hot, but have the horse power to make light work of what was a real project with my Lab/Rottweiler mix. Because they heat up, I would recommend getting a cooling type spray for prolonged use. I purchased these with,Oster Professional 10 Universal Comb Set Specially Designed to Fit Oster ClippersandOster 5 in 1 Clipper Blade Care 14.0 ozI have been using them for about a year now."
3,Gary Hoyt,"The first pair went back to Amazon for a bad high speed operating switch. The second pr. also soon had a bad high speed switch and were then mailed to a repair shop, still under warranty, postage not paid by Oster. The clippers were used on one dog, about half a dozen times."
3,Handy Clipper,"It's a usefull tool, it makes its job accurately and neat, it's a industrial type tool, but it gets a slightly hot after a few minutes of work"
5,The wonderful way to cook,The Savory Way is a wonderful vegetarian cook book without being noticeably vegetarian. I have been working my way through the cook book since I received it as a gift in September '99 and have yet to discover any bad recipes. Some I've even made twice. The recipes are easy to follow and don't require very unusual ingredients. I would recommend this cook book to anyone interested in cooking good food that is not ordinary.
2,specify if this is dvd is a toner or a cardio.....,"Why can't it simply specify whether this dvd is a toner or a cardio work-out?I have no idea what it is , so I won't buy it."
4,USA Cookbook,"I borrowed this book from a relative, and I liked it so much I had to go buy my own copy. Throughout the book, she has helpful hints and stories about experiences at various places through the US. The recipes sound wonderful, and I can't wait to try some of them especially the Virginia waldorf salad and the potato salad w/relish, mayo, & eggs (I had a version of this elsewhere and can't wait to try her version)."
3,"The band that might have band (or ""the little band that could"")","I was one of the few that got to see these guys perform as The Crawdaddies when they first started out playing frat parties around Drake University in Des Moines. Later when they became Rex Daisy and started playing bars, I played their songs on the radio at 103.3 KFMG. ""Stuck on AM"" was on one of the KFMG ""Local Licks"" compilation CDs or a benefit CD or something...it's a pretty decent tune, and we gave it a lot of airplay. ""Welcome Back"" is from one of the Pravda ""Super Smash Explosions"" compilations and was always a crowd pleaser. The best songs on this album are ""Brand New Friend"" and my favorite, the old Crawdaddies standard, ""Bottom O' The World"". These guys left Des Moines for Minneapolis and became the next Trip Shakespeare, but their big time recording contract never panned out--otherwise we'd be hearing them on the radio still today. A fun group of guys that made music that people really liked a lot...that was Rex Daisy."
3,Seek More Current Information,"I encountered this book as a required textbook for a course in Pastoral Care. I think it was probably very current when it came out in the mid-'90s, but the writing and the material seem a bit dated now. If you have to have this book for a course similar to the one I took, so be it, but if you are looking for a book on this subject matter to read out of personal interest, I would encourage you to seek a more recent book."
1,Useless for Non-clergy and perhaps even clergy,"If you were referred this book from a clergy memeber, do not buy it! It is a scholarly work, which spends much more time talking about things like racism and things like the plight of classism in Central America than about how to give help to a woman in need of guidance.The fact is, there are only a few pages on how to counsel a woman who is raped or one from domestic violence (under 10 pages, actually). This book does not address AT ALL the situation of so many women who feel that several stories in the Bible support rape. Many women I've helped have a problem linking the concept of turning the other cheek/forgiveness with allowing vicitmization.The concept of the marriage vow, as it related to domestic violence is not even covered. Many women feel they have to stay with an abusive husband out of the covenant they made to God. Women often need to feel it is acceptable and preferable to God to divorce, rather than a Sin. This book offers no help at all."
4,"Not a proof, but thought provoking","I found this book to be a fascinating read. In the first part, Bishop Spong looks at the events around the first Easter, and makes a case that something significant must have happened.In the second part, Spong delves deeper in the New Testament to see what happened. Looking beyond a literal meaning he raises interesting questions and draws thought provoking conclusions."
5,Perfect for Tabla and Harmonium,"I purchased this for my Tabla set and turned out to be very sturdy and the base is solid metal with plenty of weight to it. It is perfect for the Tabla set. The height extends to more then i need, the boom arm is easily adjustable.I was so happy with my purchase that i went back and bought another one. Now i have a perfect combination for the Tabla and the Harmonium.Buy it."
4,Good mic stand,"This is exactly what you expect. A good solid mic stand. It's short, so it isn't supposed to reach very high, but fully extended, it can go to about 4 feet. I bought it for my desk to hold a large microphone for an internet radio show ( Band Talk on Indie140.com - Weds at 1 pm pacific time) and it worked well for that, except that it tended to tip over when the arm was fully extended. The base is pretty heavy, but not quite heavy enough with my mic. You also have to be careful to really tighten the adjustments really hard or the arm will slowly drop. But for up close uses without full extension of the arm, it works great."
2,nice but flimsy,"good microphone stand with a nice heavy base however the tube which screws into the base snaps off very easily. This left me with the threaded part still in the base and a useless aluminum rod and boom. If you are very careful with it, the mic will do ok, but it is not a field mic set up."
3,Not what I expected,"Echoing the previous reviewer's sentiments, I expected to learn more about the person. Instead, you get some short articles (of uneven quality) by his students. Remarkably, the one most aligned with my current job--the Clint network--was the one I found most tedious.As a minor plus, the book has a really *nice* cover.I donated my copy to the local library."
2,Typical.,"Little boy gets initiated into studhood by a whole bevvy of sluts, bimbos, floozies, whatever you name it. That's what manga is all about those days, huh? And we finally managed to get the art of comics and mangas into mainstream lately. Too bad (and no wonder) it's still considered pubescent fodder. Oh, well."
5,Alan Axelrod applies personal objectivity and expert research into this easy-to-use primer and reference source,"Almost 1,200 entries in Encyclopedia Of The American Armed Forces cover everything from history, command organization, and famous heroes to equipment, weapons, uniforms, traditions, and special American military terminology. A two-volume set with entries organized in simple A-Z format, Encyclopedia Of The American Armed Forces is accessible, information-packed, and practical for high school students, college and public libraries, and personal reference collections. Historical consultant Alan Axelrod applies personal objectivity and expert research into this easy-to-use primer and reference source."
1,boring,"i thought that this cd was extremly boring, it was so awful that i nearly died, and its also a rip-off, 17$? are you have a laugh?"
5,onkyo rocks,this system rocks my house like no other iv had. I would say comparable to the bose just priced better.
5,Crazy Good,"I cannot believe all you get for such a low price. The speakers are not going to win any kind of beauty contest but (oh my) the sound is huge. I checked out a lot of speakers, and for the price, nothing can touch this system. I would highly recommend them."
4,sound,"sweet sound , easy to use, sooo! much better than sony, and the bose,system,not even close. also free shipping.it just gets better every day. oh hey one half the price of the other systems, [crazy] trust me on this one. you will not be sorry!!"
4,Perfect match,Amazon was the only place I could find the perfect replacement shower door handle I needed. It came on time and was easy to install.
3,Bought wrong product after I purchased it,It is the correct item but not for the shower door I needed. I will try to find the one that I need
3,Works fine,"I bought one of these about 4 years ago and just bought a replacement. The finish starts to wear off, could be because of the hard water we have. And one of the screws rusted away both times. Not a big deal, but don't expect it to last forever."
3,They Work,"They handles are pretty good. My shower door was installedon a slight angle so I have to physically life and pull to open and close the shower door. After a while they break and I have to buy more. If I could find some solid handles I would purchase them, but these aren't bad until then."
3,NASA-25 Years of Glory,"First, the good news: there is a ton of great old NASA footage in this set, including historic launches from every phase of the manned space program, lots of ""firsts"", and quite a lot of footage that is difficult to find elsewhere. If you're a space freak, you need these DVDs.The bad news: video transfers are marginal, with lots of image artifacts from the digitalization process; sound varies from poor to terrible, and the computerized soundtrack music is loud, repetitive and distracting. Many of the extras like biographies and spacecraft details are simpleminded one page splash screens that are difficult to read and not worth the effort in any case.Bottom line: good information, poorly presented."
1,Horrendous!,"These DVDs have been directly copied from VHS tape. This is totally unforgiveable and after buying this set I felt cheated! I have been researching the Apollo space programme all my life and will happily watch films with the most tenuous of links to the events, but I've not even finished watching all of these discs because they are so poor. AVOID..."
2,"Great for Schools, but...","This set is essentially repackaged old footage. Educational films produced by NASA, so in the end they're educational but at times comes across as 60's era propoganda which might be interesting for some viewers. I would have preferred more raw space footage to all the footage of ground control. this set is okay as an historical document, not so good if you're looking for lots of awe-inspiring views of Earth from space,"
2,Appearances can be deceiving,"I was very suprised at the age of some of these films. Basically repackaged stuff from the 60s, 70s and 80s. The footage is everything you've seen on TV, so if you want copies of that, get the series. If you want to learn anything new, don't bother.The series covers the early missions, the moon landings, Apollo 13 and the early shuttle. If you're looking for an A&E or History Channel series you'll be upset.While it looks ""cool"", I think there are products out there."
1,A Struggle To Finish,"Think of this story as the inverse of a Law & Order show. Instead of focusing exclusively on the crime and investigation as L&O does, Kellerman seems to want to spotlight the family instead. I kept wanting to hear about the case but instead got Decker's religious practices, a very poorly written Internal Affairs investigation, etc, etc. I put the book down twice only to pick it back up (I hate to leave a mystery unsolved) until Decker's son decided to help Dad. That was too much. Very disappointing."
4,Mass murder stumps Peter,"This book begins with a mass murder in a trendy restaurant. The police think they have found the man who did it and they are ready to close the case. Peter Decker thinks otherwise and he spends the rest of the book trying to find out what was really behind the murders. He looks into the family lives of some of the deceased and finds multiple motives for the murders. Several family members stand to gain financially and personally from the deaths of their relatives. Peter is accused of sexual harrassment when he interviews one of the suspects, and Rina stands by him when he is forced to defend himself. This is another good entry in the series."
4,One of her best,I really enjoyed this book. It has many twists and turns that keeps the reader in suspense. Again another good book by one of my favourite authors.
5,Faye Kellerman Mystery,My husband and I will read anything Faye Kellerman writes. We both love the Decker/Lazarus books. I would recommend this to everyone.
3,Not Good - Not Bad,I am not a big fan of the Decker/Lazarus series but found this one to be better than others. The mystery took top preference in this novel rather that the teachings of the Jewish faith. The writer has an aenjoyable writing style and would like to read other books outside of this series. The plot though not very imaginable wasn't boring. A decent book but not action packed.
5,I thought the book was fantastic reading.,I have read all of Faye Kellermans books and each Peter Decker story is always original and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Kellerman keeps you interested in the story to where you have a hard time putting down the book. You want to keep reading to find out who did it and why.
2,Doesn't live up to its potential,"This could have been a very interesting detective story, but it deteriorated into a boring chain of events from which the spineless characters couldn't save it. The sexist undertones really alienated me, as did the chirpy goodness of Decker's family. I kept waiting for a twist, but it never came."
1,Dissapointing entry in a good series,"Dissapointing after ""Prayer for the Dead"" - Their Orthodoxy, which used to be an interesting part of the book tapestry, has become a gimmic; the villan's identity is telegraphed by the title (yes, we have read ""Lear""); and the family has become less compelling. Skip it."
4,"Good, fast police story","After an horrific mass murder at a fashionable restuarant, Lieutenant Peter Decker is placed in charge of the follow up investigation. He slowly uncovers layer after layer of corruption involving drugs, high school students, tennis players and leading them all, a beautiful woman who seems to have a connection to everyone involved in the massacre. Jeanine Garrison initially tries to seduce Decker but becomes vicious when he rejects her advances and falsely accuses him of sexual harassment. It's a very fast moving plot, easy to read and therefore almost unputdownable-I loved it !"
3,More Kellerman ?,"This was my first ""read"" of a F. Kellerman book.I did enjoy the book, but really do not have very much to compare it with. It appears to be one of an on going set of books, and I did not know where to start with this series.I enjoyed the book, but other reviewers thought less of it.Where is the starting point, and which is the best?"
3,Toothless Serpent,"Although I count myself a Faye Kellerman fan, I can't say that this was one of her better efforts. If you enjoy following the family story and the details of Orthodox Jewish life, you won't get much color from this volume. The mystery itself is ho-hum and, as other reviewers did, I found myself waiting for Decker to catch up to me in solving the crime. I finished the book, but didn't enjoy it as much as others in the series."
1,Running Out of Steam,"I've read almost all of the Decker/Lazurus books, and this one is a real disappointment. Is Kellerman perhaps running out of steam with these characters? I, too, noticed some of the inconsistencies that other reviewers have pointed out. Also I am starting to notice more and more examples of just plain downright clumsy or ""clunky"" writing. Maybe Kellerman should slow down a bit, think through her plots a bit more, and then spend time polishing. She needs to read some of James Lee Burke's books for examples of fine writing and Ridley Pearson's for edge-of-your-seat suspense."
1,Poor Plot,"The problem with this book is the gaping flaws in the plot. The story begins by proving that more than one person must have been involved in the mass shooting, so the hunt is on. But eventually, the plot winds down, and we are suddenly presented with one perpetrator, and we are told that he must have seemed like two ""with bullets whizzing around."" (This is despite the earlier forensic evidence about the direction of the shots.) Seems quite careless plotting. There are about a dozen other improbabilities as well, but I can't go into them without giving the story away."
2,A slightly less than mediocre mystery,"An uninspiring look at how simplistic best sellers can be. The book plods, the character development is quite basic and the dialogue is unrealistic. The show-saving teens part of the plot belongs in a Nancy Drew novel, or better yet, a Scooby-Doo script, and I don't appreciate Ms. Kellerman force feeding me a Hebrew history lesson. All-in all a second rate novel that will propel me to avoid any of the author's other works."
5,Cute,"My sister is an aquatic director and found these on line and fell in love with them. So she had me buy several for her and I also bought one for myself, which I use everyday. I work at a computer all day and it is very helpful."
2,It's OK,This page up document holder works alright but is not nearly as good as the one I lost. Here are the problems as I see them. #1--product is too light-tends to slid off desk-#2-aperture for inserting documents are too large-documents blow right out with a little air such as from a fan. In order to compensate-I had to make a paper cushion and tape it down in the aperture-that works but is not really best. This page up holder needs to be larger around the base and heavier and the aperture needs to be reduced. It's pretty to look at-something my 4 year old granddaughter would like but in my opinion is not suitable for my requirements. I would not buy another just like it.
5,Page up,"I am very spoiled with this, best invention ever made, I take them with me when I travel,small light and adorable, always getting comments on how nice they are."
1,WORTHY OF A BACK YARD HOLE,EVERY NOW AND THEN I BUY A C D AND WITH AN OPEN MIND I LISTEN TO EXPAND MY HORIZONS IN MUSIC.THIS C D IS TERRIBLE!!!MY CAT WAS IN THE ROOM WHEN I PUT IT ON AND FELL DEAD ON THE SPOT.I BURIED BOTH THE C D AND THE CAT IN THE BACKYARD.....NUFF SAID.
5,Cold War Submarines book,My husband was aboard and served on two of these boats during his Naval career. We were very pleased with the book.
5,"Excellent survey, well written, needs just a few more drawings","Enjoyed this book very much, extra detail found in (for example) the ""US Submarines"" book was not especially missed. Flowed well, just a tiny bit of repetition. Only criticism is lack of at least a few cross sections, end elevations or plan views for modeling purposes. For the excellent Kindle price, though, I can wing it from the side elevations."
5,Great book,Not as many actual pix of subs as most books but it is very well written and also dabbles into the politics and design that went on with each new design of submarine. Nice charts and missile specs and things like that. Goes into greater detail of the US boats more than Soviet.
4,Favorite Country Hits,"Floyd Cramer is a classic! Demonstrated here through his earlier works, this is the grass roots of country music during the 60's and 70's. A must have for all country music enthusiast!"
3,Not his early work....But great anyway,"This is not early Floyd Cramer. This is a small sample of Floyd during his halcyon days at RCA Victor Records. To truly go back to early Floyd Cramer, you'd have to return to his 1953-1957 recordings. Two singles on Abbott Records and then his eight releases for MGM Records. To tell the truth, I don't even know if those recordings are even available. I can't think of any bad Floyd Cramer recordings. There certainly are no clunkers in this little package. The man was incredible, a studio musician who recorded on 100's (if not 1,000's) of hits by other artists and yet no one was better as a solo artist than Floyd. Buy this CD knowing that you will not be disappointed. This would rate four stars if it filled out the CD to nearly the full 80 minutes available on a disc."
2,piano,"This CD is so disappointing. I would liken it to elevator music. It's just so bland. I really, really liked Floyd Cramer back in the 1960's. He was turning out some of the best music ever !!This CD is like outakes from other recording sessions. Save your money !!! I wish I had mine back."
2,"good product, wrong description",this product is listed as 22-16awg but when it arrived it said 22-18awg on the package. I was intending to use this on 16 awg wire so I had to call the seller and have the correct size sent to me. they did send me the new ones without much of a problem although they did try to tell me that it would work on 16 awg even though it's not listed for it. I know this is not true (I am an electrician) and it would damage the wire.
4,Pet Shop Boys Fundamental is great so far,I am sure I will bump it up to 5 stars after I listen to it a second time & after I listen to the Japanese bonus disc. Sodom & Gomorrah show is great!!! By teh way..Release is a great CD & I am not sure why any PSB Fan would not like it...a true PSB Fan would love it..am I the only one?
5,Pet Shop Boys,"I continue to build my Pet Shop Boys CD collection and after listening to severals plays, Fundamental is a worthy addition. Those who truly enjoy the disco beat that makes PSB's a timeless and classic team should enjoy Fundamental."
2,Pet Shop Boys: Being Boring,"The Pet Shop Boys can no longer truthfully sing, ""we were never being boring."" This is a very disappointing, very lifeless, attempt at being ""adult"" and topical. When once they sang ""How do you expect to be taken seriously?"" mocking pompous artistes who assaulted audiences with a politically-correct ""message,"" so now have the Pet Shops succumbed.""I'm with Stupid"" is such a brilliant and original insight to Blair/Bush partnership (not). Even Tennant sounds bored and uninvolved singing the glaringly obvious ""Sodom and Gomorrah Show,"" which is ""It's a Sin"" without the cleverness, the wordplay, the pop hooks and the drama. Essentially, it's just anti-religious theme tied to a disco beat.If you must have this record because you're a Pet Shop complete collectionist, get the extended version, which includes a few pure Pet Shop dance tracks that were not included on the basic version. But do this only if you must."
1,The Wheels on the Bus Go Round Round Round....,"The beat of the songs goes ""Boom, boom boom,Boom, boom, boom. Boom, boom, boom.The beat of the songs goes ""boom, boom, boom.""That's still the way they go.The keyboards of the songs go ""Beep, beep, beep.""""Beep, beep, beep. Beep, beep, beep.""The keyboards of the songs go ""Beep, beep, beep""That's still the way they go.The singer of the songs goes ""Twee, twee, twee.""""Twee, twee, twee. Twee, twee, twee.""The singer of the songs goes ""Twee, twee, twee.""Incredibly, Unbelievably, after twenty five years,In defiance of time, space and good taste,That is STILL the way they go.C- Tom Ryan"
2,Battleship!,"I love the Pet Shop Boys, but what a disappointment this album is.I hate to say it, but this album is full of hits and misses, and the majority goes to the latter.I love the ""Sodom and Gomorrah Show"" which is wonderful PSB stuff, and the last two thirds of ""Made My Excuses and Left"" isn't bad, if you can get through the beginning weird sounds of nothing. ""I'm With Stupid"" isn't bad, but it's not great either.You expect The Boys to be sorta wacky and weird, and I love them for it, but the music isn't really here. This is really only going to fly with die hard fans. Buy a single of ""Sodom and Gomorrah"" and skip this album, and you won't be missing much."
4,BEST IN A LONG TIME!!!,"I bought this single disc version because I wanted it right a way, I could not find the double disc locally, and I have since ordered the double from Amazon.I have been a fan since Please, and I have a lot of memories that PSB have been the soundtrack to, but lately the music has been less than good (Release) although Disco 3 was great.It used to be that every single track on a PSB cd was wonderfull but not since Very have I felt that way, Nightlife came close!And this one is great but also not every track do I like-thus the 4 out of 5 stars.Be sure to buy the double disc.They are getting close to putting out a 100% great cd, maybe next time."
3,The kings of electro-pop disco are back.,"Nothing on this disc will rival their best tunes from their 18-year career, but there are still some fine moments. Ballads (tracks 3, 5, 6, 9, 11) have never been their strong point, clever lyrics notwithstanding, and this album is a little heavy with them. The dance tunes, on the other hand, are fun as always. Track 6 is a fairly short but enjoyable instrumental piece."
4,****,"overall, its a pretty good album. one of PSB best in years. but i have two complaints... there are too may slow songs on here. some work and some dont. and the other problem i have with this album is while i'm enjoying the pounding synth/dance beats, i'm also drowning in lyrics that seem too political even for the PSB. i miss the love songs they were so good at making (rent, being boring, why cant we live together, etc..) but there are some stand out tracks here. i ust wish they'd lighten up a bit."
3,Mining Scottish coal first hand.,"Robert Aitken is not an historian but a Scottish coal miner who looks back on his nearly eighty years of living as part of a coal mining community in Auchengray Parish in Lanarkshire. The positive aspects of the book include his hands on approach and human touch. Reading this book is akin to sitting on the back porch and listening to your grandfather or favorite great uncle relate stories of the 'old days.' The weakness is that while the individual chapters can be quite interesting and informative there is no overall structure. Aitken might relate something from his childhood in one chapter then relay the story of an Irish born miner in the 19th century in the next. There is also a lack of an index, footnotes, and a bibliography. However, despite these omissions, it is a delightful book, especially for those with Scottish coal mining ancestors or kin, that includes some of Aitken's poetry and a glossary of terms."
3,Runs HUGE,"I bought this sort of as a gag for my brother. His size is typically an XL and although the shirt was actually pretty good quality, the XL was GIGANTIC! If it had been more true to size I would have given it 5 stars."
5,Fine fantasy fiction,"Among the stories included in this volume are The Fox Woman, The People of the Pit, the classic story of an unnamable horror and the ruins of a lost civilization; Through the Dragon Glass, a fantasy of Oriental magic and mystery; Three Lines of Old French, in which a soldier in the trenches falls in love with a French girl 200 years old; and The Drone, The Last Poet and the Robots, The White Road, When Old Gods Wake, and The Women of the Wood."
3,Very Entertaining Fantasy-Adventure Fragments,"This is a collection of stories never completed by Abraham Merritt, once a rival of Edgar Rice Burroughs for greatest contemporary fantasist, now largely forgotten.Merritt's stories tend to be rather long, and sometimes sections are reprinted as stories in themselves! These fragments sometimes work as whole stories and sometimes don't, but are always tantalizing for Merritt fans! Others probably won't get the point..."
2,Our teacher's reading this: IT's BORING!!! by Jordan,"Ellie was an okay book. Our teacher is doing this whole thing on Amish people. As I said Ellie was all right, but now we're reading Rebecca (112 pages into it so far) and all we have heard are the same facts about Amish except this time it's about a girl named Rebecca who's going through crazy and pointless issues that never should have taken place in the first place."
5,Great Wireless Mouse,"I'm not sure if this particular mouse is still being manufactured but I think it's a great mouse. I had another one that I wore out...it took several years of heavy use but it finally gave up the ghost. I was very happy to find another one...and at a bargain price so low that it felt like a gift. If you are looking for a very good mouse that offers lots of options; one that works well on all kinds of surfaces...even your pants leg, then grab one of these if you can find one. I have used a variety of Kensington mice and trac-balls and have never been disappointed with any of them."
2,i wish i had researched before buying...,"i really wish that i had read reviews before i bought this mouse! it seems to have the same problems as the corded kengsington studio mouse (it looks exactly the same). now that i've read the reviews, i seem to have the same problem many others have had. one thing i NEED on a mouse is a scroll button/ pad... the scrolling DOES take a lot of effort and it usually stops working all together. i have to restart my computer to make it work. at first i thought it was the battery, but no. it's the mouse. sometimes the scroll might not work but it will shut down one of my applications for some reason if i accidentally touch the scroll. however, it's RIDICULOUSLY frustrating bc the base is detecting the scroll pad BUT IT IS NOT RESPONDING. as cool as it may look, i don't think it's quite worth it."
1,steam (single),I was looking for the album not the single and so was disappointed when the single came. But Ty comes through very well in this song. I love the song. So does my 16 year old son.
3,"Average for Osman, not quite what I had hoped","I've read most of the other works on this subject (his and others) and eagerly awaited this one. Honestly I was disappointed, because I suspect this is a reprint of an earlier edition. It serves largely to reinforce what has already been presented so I can recommend it only if the reader is first encountering the material. Although it has some photos, at many points the text would be improved with topical graphs or maps. How tough could that be? I'll now be watching for his next effort."
1,Motivated by his love of islam,"Osman is an Egyptian muslim bent on discrediting Christianity out of his love of islam. His bias is evident as he consistently goes against the grain on what is established and accepted. There is nothing wrong with developing theories and presenting them in books, so long as there is sufficient evidence to support your claims, at the very least enough for people to take you seriously. Osman instead resorts to criticizing Egyptologists rather then refuting their claims with actual evidence for some of these absurd claims of his. There is a reason he is not taken seriously amongst Egyptologists."
1,Startling...to say the least.,"I first read this book after viewing an article online on the Graham hancock website. I must admit that I was rather intrigued by the fearless claims made by the author. However having read widely into this genre, including authors such as Laurence gardner, I found some of the information to correlate with the vague historical context of Akhenaten. Certainly for open minded readers this book is highly recommended as a study of the origins of monotheism in an unprejudiced manner. My only criticism is that it wanders from the topic slightly later on in the book."
4,Interesting theory,Well written and led me on to further reading about this elusive Pharoah. Would recommend this book to anyone interested in this period of Egyptian history..
4,The Review,"A young man, dictated to by his overbearing mother and his watchful boss, begins murdering innocent victims. He allows them to live long enough to pen a letter to Violet Day, a famous astrologist. His ultimate target is Violet Day herself. He masterminds a plan to ruin her annual Halloween event. Ken Blackburn, an ex-cop, and Lorraine, Violet's daughter, become involved in trying to protect themselves against the killer. This was an easy read but some of the flashbacks and settings changed unexpectedly."
4,"If you like polkas, you'll love this CD","Myron Floren shows why he's considered the best accordianist around. Great tune selections, great artistry, and a fabulous band backing him up (who's that on the 2d accoridan?) I have Frankie's 2 CD collection of great polkas, but I play this one 7 times as much. Put this on in your car on Monday going to work and see if the work week doesn't start a little better!"
5,love polkas,my mom likes polkas so thats why my sister stephanie ask me to get it.the music is fun to listen to and very enjoyable by the way when we were kids my mom melane took us to polka masses at st staislause church
4,Great Deal,I had been looking for a steering wheel cover with a woodgrain look for a while and finally found this one on Amazon. I was surprised at how well the woodgrain matched the woodgrain in my car. It is made well but a little hard to get on. That's actually a good thing because you want a steering wheel cover to have a tight fit for obvious safety reasons. Just take your time when putting it on and it should fit well. I would definitely recommend it to a friend.
4,Works as well as higher priced oil.,"When the manufacturer of my outboard (2001 Johnson 150 hp OceanPro) started charging over $25 fo a gallon of TC-W3 oil, I found this to be a suitable alternative. There were no issues with the oil injection system and the motor ran great."
5,Great For Beginners,"Web editors can only get you so far...eventually you have to learn basic HTML coding. This was the first html book I ever read and it taught me so much that I was able to build my own website and also troubleshoot problems in the coding. Eventually you'll want to get a more advanced reference, but this book is a GREAT place to start and I recommend it to everyone I know who has an interest in HTML coding."
2,"Lifechanging, healing words","Sally's book was a blam for my hurting soul. I find the daily challenges of life, at times, can be overwhelming. Sally's book has provided the way, via God's truth, to a place of true heart rest as I face each storm of life. Reading this book can change you forever."
3,Good info but limited presentation,"This book has very good information, but it is buried in an inefficient, somewhat incoherent presentation, which is probably due to the lack of professional editing and development. (It is self-published.) The author is sincere and well-informed, but his credibility suffers because of the amateurish presentation. I got the information I needed by digging in and making my own summaries, but the book could have been 25-50% shorter with just as much value to the reader."
1,200 page infomercial,"This book is a 200 page infomercial for the authors company's $250.00 per ""unit"" nutritional supplement. I was looking for valid advice on improving my chanes of winning my war with cancer not someone trying to make money off my illness. Read Andrew Weil's EIGHT WEEKS TO OPTIMUM HEALTH, and LIVE."
3,Great followup to the enclosed CD,"Overall I am glad that I purchased this book in my ""agressive survailence"" of my prostate cancer. The hardest thing as someone diagnosed with cancer is deciding on a course of action to deal with it. This book is full of nutritional ways to ""fight"" cancer as well as loaded with alternative ideas on the causes and treatments. I didn't find the specifics for prostate cancer that I'd hoped to find and as a librarian I was disappointed in the lack of accuracy in the index. But, as I said, overall I am glad that I got the book and reccommend it to anyone who would really like to find health in the shadow of a cancer diagnosis. I loved the zip code listing of natural cure related centers and doctors and will be following though on that tip as well."
4,Good information for those who WANT to know the whole story,"I purchased this book for a friend with relapsed breast cancer in an effort to convince her to take simple steps to increase the effectiveness of the monoclonal antibody treatment she's having. There is loads of good, important content here for those who have the energy, interest, desire to become educated about their disease and alter their lifestyle/eating habits to battle it. For those who need to be persuaded, there may be too much academic/medical info and the gems of ""how to"" info are difficult to pick out."
5,"AUTHOR OF ""FOUNDATIONS FOR HEALING""","IF YOU OR A LOVED ONE HAVE RECENTLY BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER YOU MAY BE WONDERING WHAT YOU CAN DO TO IMPROVE YOUR ODDS. DR. QUILLIN'S BOOK, ""BEATING CANCER WITH NUTRITION"" IS A STATE OF THE ART EFFORT IN OUTLINING A PLAN OF NUTRITION THAT WILL COMPLIMENT THE DOCTOR'S TREATMENTS. THE TEXT IS CLEAR, CONCISE, AND EASY TO FOLLOW. IT IS THE BEST WORK I HAVE FOUND FOR DOCTOR AND PATIENT ALIKE. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK FOR ALL WHO WISH TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE NUTRITIONAL TREATMENT OF CANCER."
3,"""Beating Cancer with Nutrition"" review","I thought the book would have more straight ahead recipes in it that I could follow, but overall it was educational."
1,Not useful,This book felt like something written in the style of the 1890s. It doesn't address the need to eat whatever will stay down. There are so many points of view on nutrition but the bottom line is to eat what one can eat.
5,beating cancer with nitrition,Good review of pre-1999 literature. Well written and easy to follow. Needs updating badly.
2,"Hard Read, more mefical inclined.","Got some good tips, but a hard read. I will use it more to look things up than to read the whole book."
2,beating cancer with nutrition,"Very technical and repeats itself. I was hoping for a good ""how To"" book and this did not do it. Good for someone who wants a medical type book, but not a simple approach book"
3,It's selling well because of its title,"The book at times is laid out in such a consumer unfriendly manner as the label on Dr. Bronner's soap bottles. Confusing little boxes, obscure charts, a highly incomplete index. The writing style is a bit pedestrian, too. There is some fine information, but also much that is irrelevant. And as several other reviewers here have noted, you wind up wondering at times whether all of the author's arguments are objective views based on good science or the rantings of a man obsessively beating his own drum. Still, this tome can be helpful if bought with an additional text."
4,Excellent except for....,"Dr Quillan has written an excellent book. Especially the nutrition aspect. My only complaint is that there are literally hundreds of supplements to choose from. For me, it was a little overwhelming.At times, it felt like searching for a needle in a haystck. After suffering through BRUTAL chemo for 12 treatments that made me DEATHLY ill, I am convinced that I could not go through that again. The oncologist predicts this rare form of lymphoma will be back in about 5 years. So, I consulted a naturopath to help direct me, and to my surprise almost everything she currently has me on is found in Dr. Quillan's book. Plus, I have never eaten healthier in my life. Thank you Dr. Quillan! I hope to prove the oncologist wrong!"
3,"Yes, but",Much good information BUT this is written for and to several different groups and thus is overly long and somewhat confusing. Chapters could be better grouped and organized. Summary pages of recommendations would be very helpful to the reader.
5,Cats Love This,Believe it or not but I buy this for my 4 cats and they love it. Every day they say Thank You.
1,wrong product,My beef is not with the seller in this instance. Amazon gave the assurance that the product was the exact fit for the car specified. This was way off the mark as in fact these rotors will not fit the E Class Mercedes. I am now stuck with two rotors that fit the C Class.As a long time user of the Amazon service I will admit that I have been quite satisfied over the years. It is now twice in six` months that I have been disappointed. I suggest you tighten up on the system of verifying that auto parts do match the vehicle specified.
2,big mess with sizing chart,"Major gimmick with sizing since amazon.com is not listing manufacturer part numbers, but its own. Their sizing chart has major errors and the send rotors were for different model that I entered into system.There is nobody to talk to how to correct the errors.Got full refund, so this is good part, but what a headache.Rotors looks good, but were not usable for me because of amazon screw up."
3,not to good for the price,its good clipper the only thing is that it gets hot after 5 minutes of use and i dont think my dogs like that.personaly i dont think i would by that again
3,Speedy Gonzales,"It trims the hair pretty fast, but it gets hot too fast. And if it had a comb attachment, that would help a lot. It gets really close & I like that part of it."
1,why should I have to repair a new pair of clippers?,"Ditto...We clip our dogs once a year, but, I wanted to be able to do so as I have time. These worked well out of the box, but, since they ran a little hot I'd just clip our dogs half way and give them/me a rest.We have fairly big dogs that have thick double coats so I knew I needed a good pair of clippers. So, $150 or so with shipping later they worked great the first time. I lent them to our friends who have a lab mix and they worked for them. I tried them this year and they cut about 3"" and stop. I always keep them oiled and cleaned. Took apart, blew them off, brushed them off and now they don't work?Now I have to start working on what/how to fix these?"
3,Not So Great!,I decided to purchase this clipper after looking at the reviews. I was very disappointed considering the cost I expected a much better product.The clipper gets hot within approximately 10 minutes. It also does notcut great either.
5,GREAT ITEM,"STREAMLINED DESIGN, VERY EASY TO HANDLE, STAYS COOL LONGER THAN MOST, VERY FAST, SMOOTH CLIPPING, NICE LONG CORD, EASY ON AND OFF."
5,Great product,"Grooming my shih tzu had been a serious chore, until I bought these clippers. I couldn't believe how much of a difference they made. They cut great, even on matted areas. No regrets, happy with my purchase."
1,Don't work at all!?!?!!?,"Loved the reviews, took the out of box, they don't cut anything!! not anything! not even the short, unmatted hair! What could the problem be?!?! I am SO frustrated!!!!"
1,Oster A5 should be recalled,"The A5 dual speed would have been a fine piece of equipment if not for a cooling vent design flaw. Im amazed that nobody caught this in their product testing department. Many, many references about the problem are in the net.This clipper BURNS. It burn YOU. It overheats to the point of not being useable. To try and get the thing open to clean the tiny, ill placed air filter is a chore. Amazing that there hasnt been a recall or class action lawsuit."
5,You Get What You Pay For,"I'm extremely glad I finally took the plunge on the price of a better quality product. My mini schnauzer and I are much happier--the clippers glide through her hair with minimal strokes; although a little chunky to hold, they're still quite easy to manuever; it's much quieter with less vibration and heat than my cheapy old pairs (yes pairs-[knock] I should've had an a-5!); most importantly, my pup looks gorgeous!"
5,Best pair of dog clippers,"I have been using a cheap pair of Wahls and another pair I bought from ...mart that advertised ""heavy coats"". It took about an hour and a half to cut my dogs hair with those and was an uneven haircut. I bought this clipper and tried it out. It literally cut my dogs (collie/shepard mix) like a knife through butter. She had her winter coat and it went through it without problem. I was amazed. Took about 15 minutes total. Only issue I had was with speed o guide guard that I bought from #bay that was advertised as fitting. It clipped (not fit) to the clippers but just bound up hair. The clipper motor is a little loud for clipping around my dogs face (she didnt like it) but then again she didnt like the hum from the other clippers that didnt work. You may wanna look into the two speed but I dont really think any dog will like clippers by their face.To conclude this, these are a GREAT pair of clippers. Money well spent."
3,Way too loud and no blade comb,"If your dog is at all skiddish about the noise of a clipper, don't get this one. Granted, the dog clipper I had before this one was not very good or professional, it didn't scare my poor puppy. I felt bad for the dog. She's been getting clipped by me for 4 years and is used to it. I wanted to upgrade to a better clipper, because my previous one, also an Oster, was not that great. The product itself is powerful. You can probably clip an entire small dog in about 5 minutes, which if that's your goal, this is the product for you. It's blades are sharp and cut your grooming time in half. But like I said, your dog has to not be afraid of the noise. The blades are not adjustable either, which I blame myself for not thinking about why I would need this. I prefer to adjust the blade vs. changing out blades. I am not a professional and I really don't have the time or the want to do this. There it is, my honest opinion. Good luck in your search!"
4,Oster A5 clipper,I have used Oster clippers for many years. I am a professional groomer. These new ones aren't as heavy duty and I have had two problems with the switch. It used to be metal and now it is plastic. I returned them to the manufacturer and they were excellent taking care of the problems. The Oster is still balanced just right for me. After over 15 years of work I still do not have carpel tunnel. Grateful!!
5,"Wonderful to use clippers! Cut well, long lasting!","I have a pair of these that I purchased about 6 years ago. I really like them. They were recommended to me by a poodle owner of many years. She said that they are the best! They are the best clippers that I have ever owned. Yes, you do need to oil the blades, that is in the instructions. I oil mine before, during and after use. I clean the blades also with the cleaning brush during and after each use. I have different blades for the area that needs trimmed. There is a chart on the net under Oster clipper blades for dogs, to look up the correct blade for the area that needs trimmed. I did have my blades sent off to be sharpened after I used them for several years. You can have them sent off to be sharpened, or purchase new blades whichever you choose to do. As far as I have experienced if you follow the directions, these will last you for years and do you a fine job, they have for me."
5,Great Product,Bought to trim a Newfoundland dog. Very thick fur and had issues with other trimmers pulling the fur. This one will go right threw any knots that are to close to the skin to brush.
5,Great,I have tried to find a product which would allow me to groom my Lhasa Apso at home because of issues with her eyes. The attachments on this product fit the bill.
3,It's OK,"I wasn't aware that I had a favorite brand, until I wanted to upgrade to a higher RPM clipper. I decided to try the Oster Golder Single Speed and was sadly disappointed. I have an Aussie and it did NOT cut her hair. I had to apply a lot of pressure to get the hair into the blade and most of the time it glided over it and didn't cut at all. I had to go over the same area repeatedly and it was still left patchy.It was fresh out of the box, oiled and ready to go, so I am not sure why it wasn't working for me.I was not loud, but it is awfully heavy, which when you get a ""better"" motor that happens. It got hot after about 15 minutes of continuous use, which I find to be about the average with any clipper.I returned this clipper and got the Andis AGC single speed clipper for a lot less and it has performed more to my expectations. It evened out areas that the Oster missed and went through the hair like ""butter""."
5,Oster 78005-010 Golden A5 Single-Speed Clippers,"Very efficient clippers. Great on thick coats. Fast, stays cool. If you're new to using clippers, be careful not to cut too close to the skin. Comes with a 10 blade. Recommend purchasing other size blades to accommodate different coats. I prefer a 4 blade on the thick curly coat of my Cockapoo."
1,Unhappy,"I have used these clippers for 2 years & was very satisfied UNTIL they stopped cutting. Motor ran fine, blades moved and were sharp & lubricated but would not cut. I called Oster and they convinced me to spend $45 on a new set of blades. I installed the blades and everything looked and sounded great but again, they would NOT cut a thing. They are now in the trash. Don't waste your money or time, move on to a better product."
1,"worked for years, then wouldn't cut even with new blades!","I bought my Golden A5 trimmer about 7 years ago and used it for years, grooming 4 Bichons every few months. Within the last year I'd notice that the blades would jam up in their coats. I thought I needed new blades and so went out and bought 2 new blades of differing sizes.To my surprize, they jammed up too. Just would not cut their hair at all. Like others said, I did all the cleaning, lubing, adjusting of the blades and trimmers all along. But no matter what I do this unit will not cut my dog's hair. The blades are moving, but no cutting. Bizarre.Now I have all these blades and for what I spent on them I could have bought a new set of clippers. I have thought about ordering a new A5 unit, but after reading these reviews I realize that would be a huge waste of money.I think I am going to look at Andis at Wal-Mart or PetsMart. Oster seems to have gone down in quality and I am not spending more on blades that don't ""cut it""!"
5,Oster 78005.010 Golden A5 / Articulo de Calidad,"La Oster Golden A5, resulto ser un articulo de muy buena calidad tal y como lo describen sus vendedores, excelente para el trabajo diario en peluquerías caninas y a un precio muy cómodo.Recomiendo la compra de este articulo. 100% ++++"
4,Now we are talking!,"I got a Oster from the pet store to shave by German Shepherd for summer and it was pitiful so I went back to Ol' faithful Amazon and ordered this.NOW WE ARE TALKING.Yes, it does get hot. Yes, you may have to oil it. But I shaved my 13 yr old shepherd in about 15 minutes. He is like a new man in the GA heat. I look forward to years of use!"
2,VERY LOUD OSTER GOLDEN AS,"I got these on the recommendation of an experienced dog groomer, however my complaint is that they are HUGE way too big for my small hands and they are VERY EXCESSIVELY LOUD, not quiet as described. My poodle does not like these clippers, but until i can find a quieter set then I'm stuck with them! My advice, buy them locally so you can test out the sound and size before buying. Wouldn't buy again."
3,Grandma of 6,I bought this item for my 7 year old grandson. The sponge pieces are so tiny that at times he had trouble picking them up and got a little frustrated. All in all it kept him entertained for hours and he seemed to enjoy putting the designs together
2,The size is disappointing,"I overlooked the dimensions when ordering this item. I was very disappointed when they arrived. The pieces are way too tiny for little hands to enjoy, and it's not a very well thought out item at all. I do regret purchasing this item."
2,expectations,"It just wasn't what I expected, the pieces are too tiny to work with. Also, the templates are incomplete, not all of them are included."
2,Not as much fun as we thought!,My daughter was really looking forward to receiving this toy. The 2000 magnetic pieces are extremely tiny and very hard to handle. She played with the toy less than 5 times and has no interest in ever playing with it again.
3,"DR.JEKYLL VS. THE WEREWOLF REVISITED""","I HAVE THIS RETRO-HORROR GEM FROM THE EARLY 70'S AND FEEL IT DESERVES A RESSURECTION! WHERE ELSE CAN YOU FIND A LADY IN DISTRESS, CREEPY CASTLE, A MAD DOCTOR, A WOLFMAN TURNED PART TIME MR.HYDE? HEY, IN THIS DAY AND AGE, BETTER TO HAVE 2 JOBS! IT IS VERY EUROPEAN AND VERY FUNNY IN PARTS. SO IF MONSTERS FROM THE GOTHIC GOLDEN AGE IS WHAT YOU'RE AFTER...YOU FOUND THE RIGHT CASTLE."
3,Easy to assemble but....,"good quality, easy to assemble, easy to adjust but the lower cymbal holder doesn't have a sleeve so I am concern about key-holing my cymbals - which has not occurred so far yet but I am still putting my least expensive and smaller type cymbals there"
2,Not an alarm clock,"This product, despite being tagged as one IS NOT AN ALARM CLOCK! Had I been looking for an mp3 player, I would have rated this higher, but considering that this is the first item to come up on a search for mp3 alarm clock, this product fails to tell time. I would die a happy man knowing that the alarm clock tag was removed from this."
4,"Cheap, and good product","If your looking for a cheap mp3 player, this is a good choice. The built-in speakers are decent quality, and haven't broken yet, and ive had it for about a year or so. The only issue i can think of is that it has only 512mb of memory and doesn't hold a lot of music."
2,Surprising Disappointment,"My review of this book echoes those before me insofar as the typos are concerned. I am transitioning over to InDesign from Pagemaker and thank goodness I know Adobe products as well as I do. In the first 25 pages there are over 5 major errors that cost time. They misnumber their example pages (ie: see page 3 but the picture they show is actually of page 2) to telling you the wrong menu to select (Go to type>text wrap, when in reality the text wrap command is under window>text wrap) Since I have a good knowledge of Adobe, I can overcome this, but if you are not mostly familiar with adobe's interfaces through photoshop, pagemaker, etc, this IS NOT THE BOOK FOR YOU. I love a lot of the CIB books too, but this one is a miserable experience. Hope they get a new editor before they lose more readers. Plus, once you open the classwork CD you can't return the book. Don't make my mistake!"
2,In Design Classroom in a Book errors,"I am not a computer expert. I purchased InDesign Classroom in a book because I knew it would go step by step. Unfortunately there are fonts needed that are not on the disk (i.e. Adobe Garamond Pro, Graceless...?) Making a substitution does not always work. There are too many errors in the book. The biggest problem is trying to find an e-mail question site."
2,Adobe InDesign Classroom in a Book,"If the authors had bothered to proofread and actually test things out, this could have been just as good as the other CIB texts, such as those for PageMaker and Acrobat. Instead, I have to constantly check my Visual Basic book for which button/pulldown etc. REALLY performs the function I need, thus wasting valuable time.I hope sincerely that the next book is edited and that someone actually TESTS it out before sending it off to the printer."
4,Great as a webcam for Windows!,"I'd originally gotten this for my PS2 (original edition, and still works today!), and over time become burnt out on the Eyetoy games, I have the 360 kinect now. :P I've then just recently rebuilt my desktop and needed a webcam, after finding this in a drawer I discovered it's fantastic as a high-end webcam. The built-in microphone makes it even better! Not at all pricey too, gonna get a couple of these for relatives, as webcams.Only one little dislike, as with mine I've noticed in prolonged use, lets say a long skype call, the intense bare led's can be a little blinding after a while. Fixable, but annoying.[...]"
1,no good,you can see yourself just a little but for my three year old niece it was fine so i kept it for her little enjoyment but for me i would have sent it back
5,Antigrav,"The Eye Toy Camera is so much fun. you don't need a control to play,you just need your body."
3,Not quite what I was looking for,"While I was looking for a good beginners type of book, I found this to be a little TOO basic. I really didn't learn anything inspirational or get any new ideas to try out.If you have no idea at all what BDSM is about, then this is a good book to get you on your way. But, I think for anyone else who has any sort of inkling of what BDSM entails, they'd do better looking for a slightly more advanced book.There were some good cautionary tips provided for the section on bondage. And the author is well spoken.This book would've been a lot better if the author had expanded more in each chapter. (Each chapter was on average maybe a page or 2)"
4,Very much a beginners book,"No nonsense, this book delivers on its title. The Lady who wrote it is kind, not overly ambitious and understands her subject. She does not make silly suggestions which would frighten off a woman who is being wooed as a dominant. She also does not give a potential submissive the idea that he can just lie back and offer his ""submission"" as a gift, she makes it clear dominance is the real gift. All in all, a good book to start a voyage into the wonderful world of BDSM."
3,Short work of female dominance,"Lady Green is not very verbose, which is OK but doesnt make for an in-depth book. I liked her style, but was disappointed in the length of her book. Female domination style play is somewhat involved, and her work on this subject is pretty brief. What she did write is good, but its like reading the readers digest condensed version of female dominance. If your looking for more, consider this book and Mistress Lorelei's book too. If your considering buying this book for your wife/girlfriend/whatever,and that person doesnt have much free time to read, this book is perfect. It will take her about an hour to read."
1,"Very simplistic, information available elsewhere","I was severely disappointed in this book. I have no experience in the subject, but have read one other book. I found NOTHING new in this book. If you have read anything on sexual dominance at all, skip this book. If you or your significant other are completely new to the subject (as in have never heard of it) then this book MIGHT have some value to you. Otherwise, choose something else to read.In my opinion, a beginner would want an answer to the question of ""why"" her partner wants to play in this way. There is nothing of substance to answer that question. Honestly, after reading one book on the subject, I could have written this book. And that is not me bragging--I'm saying that this book is that simplistic.This was wasted money, in my opinion."
5,Educational,I really like the way the writer makes the reader feel in this book also! Very helpful to someone with little knowledge on the subject!
3,Not bad,This book was a good read. The information is basic and helpful. It is not a hardocre idea book. Its just for starters playing with the idea. Could use more detail but over all I was pleased. one nice thing is you can contact the writer if you want to know more.
2,Not so much.,"Really didnt ""do it"" for me. More of a ""how to"" rather than an adventurous tour. Sort of a snoozer."
4,good book,This was a good read and the different chapters will asiist me in the future I hope.l. Still have to work on a few areas
2,Buy it if you have money to waste!,"The book is fine but nothing really special. I guess it'd be ok if you've never heard of Dominance before, but it's really low grade info that you can get from googling around. Not worth the money IMO, find free info on the net (there's a LOT of it on forums!) before wasting your money on this fluff. But it if you have the money to spend of mild entertainment or information geared towards people that aren't that smart."
3,not too bad,"All these fem-domme books basically tell the same story about protocol of there profession. Its nice to hear about the reality behind the 'dungeon' doors. I recommend the book 'Domestic Domina' written by Mistress Cristian ,a mother who is a Dominatrix and reflects upon her own sexuality and terms of practicing Domination."
2,Gotta be Cruel to be Kind....,"This book purports to be about alternative lifestyles... how to break into the world of S&M; or BDMR... and if you really need to know the ropes, I suppose this book would be a good starting point. However, I found the illustrations to be overly childish and cartoonish.True, these few simple illustrations may set you at ease, and make an offensive topic more palatable, but let's be frank: This book is about one person's subjugation to another's abuse. Dress it up any way that you want, it's still about abuse, humiliation and (at its worst) torture.Is that what you're into? Then you already KNOW what this book will tell you. Perhaps it will give you a few vicarious thrills... or perhaps tell you of a few more practices that you hadn't heard of yet.If you're not, then this book will try to open your eyes and justify the lifestyle and practices. Do you really need that?It left me cold."
4,The Perfect Starting Point For A Timid Beginner,"I purchased this book because, while I have been in a D/S relationship for several years, I have never played the dominate role. My husband has recently decided to try out his submissive side. I was TERRIFIED!!! I wanted to try it, but felt utterly clueless of where to start despite the fact that I have played the role of submissive for over several years with him.This book, while very short, did give me a starting point and helped me build enough confidence for our first scence with me playing to dominate role. (If you'd like to know, it went very well ~*big smile*~)I recommend this book for those curious, but have not tried it before, who feel timid, nervous and even clueless as to where to start.I also recommend that for those subbies out there who purchase this book for their ""to be Mistress"" to read it before you give it to her, but skip Chapter 11. It offers beginners advice and tips for both Mistress and sub.Thanks so much Lady Green!!!"
2,No need to buy,"I read this book in about 20 minutes while sitting at the B&N. It's content is average at best. The way it is laid out the author seems to be lighting up the topic. That maybe be fine in some instances, but I dont think it works for the topic of dominance. Id recommend Claudia Varrin's Art of Sensual female dominance as a much better choice. That book is more in depth & does more to explore the psychology of the feelings behind being a dominant female - Which I found helpful in calming my nerves about my new feelings towards D/s."
2,Bad Boys of the Bible (2 books),"The content of these books may be good, but since I have difficulty reading small print, it was unacceptable to me. I am returning these books and ask that you credit my Mastercard.I inadvertantly ordered 2 copies of the Slightly Bad Girls of the Bible workbook, so I am returning 1 of the copies. Again, please credit my Mastercard."
1,Sony Mini-Hifi CD Player does not work no disc issue,"I have had this product just about 1 year , liked its features CD/MP3 etc and thought it was good value from a name brand. But I have to say with less than 20 hours of using it over the 1 year the 3-CD player does not work - Sony wants me to spend $$$ to get it fixed - its like new , hardly used - they dont stand by their brand - I have had many Sony products and I must say quality is coming down - i am facing many issues with other Sony prodcts too. I guess I wont be buying any more Sony products..."
3,Good product,Only had the item for several months so the realibilty is yet to be determined. So far it is a good radio and multi-CD player and is used daily.
3,FM radio reception,The only thing I am disappointed about with this Sony component system is the fact that it was not designed to have wire connections for hooking to an external antenna for better FM reception. It becomes difficult to get good reception. When you live in an area with a higher altitude FM reception becomes difficult. Also I thought the stereo had a port for playing cassettes. However after reading the literature the manual mentions that components sold in North America do not have cassette ports. I should have read the fine print. Other than the above the component plays pretty good with the CD's
3,Not really mini.,"I needed a small system for the bedroom.I saw the price and the Sony name and bought it.Did not read the dimensions.Mistake.This is smaller than a full sized system but ""mini"" it ain't. The unit without the speakers is 19""Dx12""Hx8""W.It will not fit in a regular bookcase and sticks out 5 inches.I have no beef with the machine at all.Works great and sounds great and love the mp3 in feature.Just beware the size."
3,Sony stereo review,"I am somewhat disappointed with this stereo because an earlier review indicated that it got better radio reception than other stereo sets. I disagree. It does not get any better reception than my other system I replaced.Otherwise, it is a good system worth the money."
3,It is okay but no tape player,"I just hooked up my stereo. I am very disappointed that there is no tape player. I thought it had one. Unfortunately after reading some of the other reviews I found out that the tape player is not in the model for the states. I literally have a couple hundred tapes that I will have to still keep my other Philips stereo to play them on. I suppose I might have to ""stack"" the new sony one on top of the bigger Philips. Other than this very unfortunate thing, the stereo seems okay so far. Amazon shipped it quickly and efficiently. I have no complaints on their service. The sound quality is good. The remote is a little confusing. But I am sure I will get the hang of it quickly. If you do not need a tape player, this is a good buy for the price."
3,Not as expected,"I bought this for my daughter. It seemed perfect, but I was disappointed when it arrived:1. It was much bigger and heavier than I envisioned. She couldn't find room for it in her room.2. It did not have an iPod dock as I expected, merely an input to connect one.3. It did not have a cassette deck as advertised. This was the decider for me.Much of the blame was mine--after studying so many units, I may have confused some of the features, and if I had read more reviews I would have noticed that there was no tape deck in North American units and the features were incorrectly advertised by Sony.We didn't even plug this unit in since it was obviously not a keeper. The return was handled flawlessly by Amazon; the lady I dealt with even had UPS pick it up at my house at Amazon's expense since I was in bed recovering from hip surgery. I continue to be a big fan of Amazon, and have all the comfort in the world doing business with them."
5,Great little stereo,Terrific little stereo. Powerful for it's size. Especially enjoy the 3-CD capability and remote.Wish it weren't such an ugly design but the price makes it well worth it.
4,Sounds good,"Nice little stereo. The CD changer is a little slow and noisy, but that is not unusual. I haven't tried it with MP3's yet. The sound, volume, and controls are nice. The included antennas seem to pick up distant stations well. That is important for country-dwellers like me."
4,Great stereo for 100 bucks,"This stereo is exactly what you would expect from Sony and for 100 bucks:Pros:Light-weight; Easy to move; 3.5 mm audio input (for your Ipod or MP3 player); good sound.Cons:Speakers don't attach to the stereo (3 seperate pieces, not heavy, just ackward)I bought this stereo to have music outside for Bar-B-Ques, parties, etc and it works perfect for that."
3,shocked,I was shocked when I got the unit and it did not have a casset player. The unit I saw on the web site had one . Other than that I like the unit.
5,"So far, so good","The little wall mounted Phillips unit I had couldn't project a roomful of music so I banished it to the kitchen where it's OK.This Sony unit met all my criteria: 1)reasonable price 2)full-featured 3) compact d)name brand e) FREE shipping-yippee! f) no sales tax (I could have bought in person at Target but sales tax would have made Target's unit $8.00 higher....worth the few days wait.I have limited space in my Tudor cottage and the relatively small footprint of the Sony made it possible to use a nice small wall table.While I've only had the unit a week everything works and I haven't yet read the manual. I have NEVER been disappointed in a Sony product.I STILL CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY THE LITTLE EXTERNAL PLUG-IN ANTENNA MAKES RECEPTION WORSE, NOT BETTER."
4,Mini Stereo/cd player,"Very pleased with unit. Main unit is 16 x 8 x 12 inches, speakers are 8 x 8 x 12 inches. Has great sound, remote takes a little time to get used to, the instructions have a layout of main unit and remote unit with number tags for controls, but no legend to tell what the numbers are for. Have to read thru instructions until a number shows up, then match to the drawing. Small matter. Packaging is cardboard egg-carton molded around units banded together, adequate protection. 3 cd trays, easy to use; radio station presets easy to set up. Highly recommended for the money."
2,Rare 3 CD changer in great sounding system,"The sliding tray style CD changer is easy to load and sort CDs. Hard to find small systems with good multi CD changers now that mp3 players are so dominant.Sounds great- even at low volume levelsNot my preferred style (would have liked a more quiet office mini-stereo style...this looks like a boom box to me- but sound and price more than make up for it.Two year follow up. This unit broke after less than a year of use, the CD changer would no longer load and the unit would auto power down for no apparent reason....really disappointing"
3,NOT a Hi-Fi. Main unit good but speakers.....,"Some notes for potential buyers.Bought this unit from SonyStyle and was happy with shipping, packageWhen I turned this Stereo Mini Hi-Fi I couldn't believe. For this kind of money expectations should be low, even so it went under the floor...Single thing which stopped me from returning it was the cost of shipping(almost 30%).Sony definitely made a mistake calling it a Hi-Fi(or marketing trick to fool customers)As it turned out main problem are speakers. Don't be fooled by their size as they sound more like an insult to ears.If you spent almost the same amount and buy decent speakers(or have ones) it changes the picture.Conclusion: Main unit is worth the money to spent with versatile functionality and decent quality. Throw away included speakers and buy decent ones, so you can listen to music and watch TV with kids.You might say it doesn't make sense. Maybe, but I'm happy now after spending double from expected. Nice way to make money for somebody :)"
1,Big Mistake,"Short and sweet, after a month of use, the disc changer does not work. An error message appears, no disc even though there are discs in the unit. I strongly suggest to stear away from buying this."
1,Good until went totally bad.,"I purchased this stereo March 2009. It was much larger than I expected for being a ""shelf unit"" but the sound was really good. The CD player never seemed to work when loaded with 3 at a time but I usually just had one in so I didn't bother with it (thought maybe I was doing something wrong). May 2010 the CD player just stopped working. I can load one and it just says ""reading"" and makes noises but will not work. I couldn't find the paperwork until today and of course it's out of warranty. I am really disappointed with this being a Sony because the last one I had worked for 10 years or more. It's not worth sending it back so now I have to look for another one and I know it won't be a Sony."
5,Great Stereo at a low price,"I've had this stereo for 2 years and it is excellent. It still works the same as it did the day i bought it. If you are gonna buy a stereo i really recommend buying this one, it is amazing."
4,An excellent sound for College Apartment Dwellers,This was a Christmas gift for my daughter ... a college student dwelling in a small one bedroom. It has everything you need for listening pleasure!
1,Doesn't work,"I ordered this since the reviews were good overall, but the one I received didn't work. I just wasted two hours of my time setting it up, trying to get it to work, calling SONY (who concluded it was defective) and now I'm returning it. In my family we have had about 3-4 stereo systems over the past several years and even when they work they have a tendency to suddenly stop working for no apparent reason - I have to remind myself (and those of you reading this) that stereo systems, these days, are very, very delicate, made cheaply and stop working quickly. I'm going back to boom boxes."
2,Ugly as sin...,"I purchased this after reading many positive recommendations -- but no one mentioned that it looks like a boom box on steroids. Tacky-looking shiny silver and black, all sorts of useless protruberances -- one big ugly stereo unit, two big ugly speakers. Designed by/for bikers? I live in a rural area with iffy reception and this does worse than my puny little kitchen radio in tuning in local FM stations. Add to that complicated instructions for switching among stations and modes and you have a really unappealing product for anyone over the age of 15."
3,Sounds good,"Sony MHC-EC55 Mini Hi-Fi Component SystemThe sound is good. My major complaint is that there are no inputs from the back of the system and only one in the front. If you are interested in radio/CD play only, this is a good system for you. If you want MP3/Tape/TV or other input ports,I suggest you keep looking."
1,junk,"I bought this item and from the moment i recieved it, it did not work...it was returned and i got robbed the 22 bucks it cost for shipping it to me...wont buy from them again!! zero stars in my book! I sent them an email inquiring about shipping and heard nothing back...."
4,Outstanding Value,I purchased this stereo after another brand I had purchased less than a year ago went kaput. We are very pleased with this unit for the small room where we have it placed.
2,a great frustrating piece of equipment.,I bought this unit thru Amazon several years ago hoping for a reasonably priced CD player/radio. The sound is quite nice but it is very difficult to tune and setting the stations memory does not work. The whole outfit is counter-intuitive when trying to change options as well as channging discs. The last straw was when the tray jamed and refused to open locking in two of my favorite dics. Chat room help was not helpful AT ALL! I ended up destroying the change tray to retrieve my discs. I only hope the are not ruined. The order was filled and shipped well but the product itself is a total waste.
2,great at first but junk eventually,it worked for about a year than has trouble playing cds great sound but horrible quality. definitly not worth buying only becuz the cd player has trouble playin.
1,not worth it,"We bought this stereo to use in a retail store, which means daily usage. A stereo should be capable of that, but the CD loading mechanism has already stopped working. When will these companies go back to making CD players that only take one CD player; the multi-disc players are rarely a success. I would not recommend this stereo to anyone who is a serious music listener. It won't be able to keep up. We have had this stereo for 14 months. What a waste of money!"
1,Not as advertised,"My daughter loves music and as such is very particular in the features she wants. She has an extensive music collection which includes some cassettes and she wanted a system with a sub-woofer. Despite what the technical specs say, this system has neither. I thought it would be a perfect gift as most systems with subwoofers are much more powerfull than she needs (they are also much more expensive) and was very disappointed with what I received. I was also unimpressed with Amazon's lack of interest in resolving the situation. I have returned the unit and will seek another system elsewhere."
4,Poetry and subtlety,"Like other works by Eugénio de Andrade, ""another name for Earth"" is a beautifuly written book, with great refinement in the language which depicts the poetry of the elements of nature. A sensual and compeling work of a comtemporary portuguese writer of great sagacity and bearer of an unique voice."
5,The Quilt,"This is one of my favorite books! If you love a tender story and enjoy quilting, this book will touch your heart. I have a copy for myself and have given some as gifts."
5,"Touching, gentle, insightful story - a joy to read.","I am a quilter and this book touched my heart. It's short and quickly read - you may want to read it more than once. In her own quiet way, Mary got her message across through a very special quilt. In the end, it wasn't the quilt that mattered so much as what was learned in the making of it."
2,Just okay,"This book was okay. It seemed over-exaggerated to me the way everyone was so against her making a quilt, like she was about to go rob a bank or something. I kept picturing her next line being something like, ""Now you all leave me alone, I'm gonna rob that bank and that's all there is to it.""Other than that, it was a sweet enough story. The photography is beautiful, so it would make a great gift for someone. It also makes a lot of references to the Bible for the more spiritually-minded people out there."
4,"Covers the state, but there are better books if you day-hike","If you're going to Southcentral Alaska (i.e., anywhere within 100 or so miles of Anchorage, including the Kenai Peninsula) a much more comprehensive and useful book is 55 Ways to the Wilderness in Southcentral Alaska by Helen Niehauser (sp?). Unlike 55 Ways, Dufresne's book does cover the whole state, but it lists only a small number of hikes, and they are all multi-day trips, some of them requiring good route-finding skills. It also appears that Dean Littlepage's (sp?) book on hiking in Alaska has statewide coverage and lists many more hikes than this book, though I have only thumbed thru the TOC of that one. On the other hand, Dufresne knows his stuff, writes engagingly, and describes some renowned multi-day hikes in depth. I took a longish trip to Alaska hiking the trails he recommended and had a wonderful time."
2,Not quite as advertised,I have a Dell laptop. This inverter provides sufficient power to recharge the battery while I drive. But it 'cuts out' if I try to turn on the laptop to use it in the vehicle. The information on Amazon.com doesn't make clear the limitations of this product.
1,The worst power inverter I've seen yet,"First off, this thing was almost too long to fit between the ""lighter"" and other parts of the vehicle. I bought this to power my laptop on a trip, and it worked fine on the way out. On the way back though, the power kept cutting out randomly as said in another review. When I unplugged to, it fell apart. For the rest of the trip it kept falling apart, and eventually I lost the internal spring and couldn't re-assemble it. It was the worst thing I have ever bought"
5,AWESOME,"I liked this item, it works well the only problem I had was that it came in a huge box with 3 yards of paper that was not necessary. It was too funny though watching my son open it for his christmas! He thought the box was empty"
5,spirit medicine,the book spirit medicine have good information how about to learning to healing and releasing negative thought.
2,spirit medicine,"I did not find this book very helpful, I would not recommend it, get it from the library 1st. Then if you like it buy it."
3,Damaged before shipment,"Although the website indicated 2 items were in stock, we received an email about 1 week after the order telling us they found a problem with the gauge before shipping it to us and would we be interested in some discount headlights. Last I looked, a headlight is not a good replacement for a vacuum gauge. What were they thinking? The good news is that the refund apparently went through quickly without problems (has not showed up on my bank statement yet, though)"
5,classy sporty watch,This watch is very nice. I have gotten many complements from friends saying how nice it is. Very good value for the price. Invicta is an excellent watch brand.
2,Over priced junk.,"Over priced. I have bought it from woot and they don't accept returns unless the product is defective :(I expected it to be little larger, since I like big watches. The watch looks nice but the quality is not that good. The black pieces on the bracelet are just painted black steel links which you don't expect from a over 150$ watch. Silver hands on the silver dial are sometimes hard to see.This watch should not cost more than 50 bucks. I would never by another Invicta watch unless I see it in a store, in front of my eyes."
4,Good but WAY overpriced,"A good product that needs to be periodically replaced. This sack of 100 foam sleeves, made in Mexico, couldn't have cost more than a dollar to manufacture. I should have checked the cost of replacement sleeve's before buying the earphones."
5,Fine Berlioz From Gergiev and the Vienna Philharmonic,"Since Berlioz's life and career is being celebrated this year, I am not surprised that Valery Gergiev decided to record Berlioz's most popular orchestral work with the Vienna Philharmonic. It is an excellent performance, replete with much warmth and brilliance, from one of the world's greatest orchestras. However, I would not recommend this performance over Sir Colin Davis's electrifying accounts with both the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra and London Symphony Orchestra. Instead, this is a fine alternative, showcasing Gergiev's skill at coaxing dramatic, fiery performances from the orchestras he conducts. The true gems on this recording are those two sung by one of Gergiev's favorite singers, supported by thrilling performances by the Vienna Philharmonic. These are a rare coupling with the Symphonie Fantastique. The sound quality is splendid, up to Philips' state-of-the-art standards."
5,Fantastic Berlioz,I love the tempos Giergiev chooses for the Fantastique. The molten honey-like flow he imparts to the music and his command of the dynamics brings out something I've missed in the Colin Davis recordings. This isn't just another rousing 1812 overture kind of thang! It's something lyrical and transformed. The sound quality of the recording is superb. (Be warned - the photographs of Gergiev show him to be the type of tormented soul who could really empathize with Hector Berlioz!)
4,Great...almost,"I am using this cooler to cool some very low latency Patriot memory sticks. I had to up the voltages on these DDR2 memory sticks, so they run SUPER HOT. That said, this cooler is awesome. It keeps the temps down, and actually has lowered my overall mobo temps by 5 deg C!What I don't like: While pretty, the chrome case is exactly what you don't want in a machine that has a 8800 GTX or Ultra in it. The cooler in my machine actually rests across some components on the big card! If it were plastic, I wouldn't mind. However, the metal case caused a lot of concern. I placed some Scotch linerless 130c rubber tape and some Scotch 33 tape over the end of the cooler to keep it from shorting out the video card.Otherwise, a nifty cooler! Very pretty and very effective!."
5,Works Great and looks good,"This thing looks Great all Chrome and pretty blue LEDs. and the performance is even better, near silent running and keeps my Memory much cooler used to almost burn me to the touch. running at high clock. now its just VERY warm. and Fits very snugly, and the different mounting options it comes with is great I had a very tight fit in my case, CPU Heat sink and MOBO Power right next to it. took a while to get it right, but got it fine. Great buy, If you have a heat issue, GET THIS you wont be disappointed."
4,works well for older systems too!,"I have an older system with 2gb of RDRAM in it. This memory runs VERY hot, surface temps on the memory heat spreaders went from 73-74 to 34-35 degrees Celsius with this thing. Never had any errors but it was a bit disconcerting before.This is built real solid, clips on to most standard motherboards. It is solid metal. The only thing I don't like are the lights but it is not a big deal, you can't see them with the lid on.System specs:Compaq:Intel d850gb motherboardpentium 4 1.5ghz2gb samsung 800mhz-45ns ECC rdram (4x512MB)Nvidia quadro fx1000 graphics cardetc..."
1,Broken after a few wallnuts,"I was very dissapointed in this ""innovative"" tool because it's just broke after a few days. May be for peanuts it will work but..."
3,Not herby or garlicky,"I am not sure if I just got a bad batch, or they all like that. But, the Starkist Herb & Garlic Tuna Creations I tried was very bland: no garlic taste and also not many herbs if any at all - just lightly marinated tuna. It's not bad; but where are herbs? Where is garlic?"
5,Excellent product even more excellent price,"Bought these for my Smith & Hawking patio furniture and they are incredible! Perfect fit, thick material, quality product. I wouldn't hesitate recommending these."
5,Really nice,"I am really impressed by the quality of this cover. It is thick, easy to use. They look good sitting on the patio as well"
4,Well made,This is a high quality cover. It fits your standard 4 ft bench. I like the heavy duty fabric and the fact that you can still sti on the bench even when it is covered.
5,Heavyweight canvas material perfect fit for Allen Roth Eastfield Loveseat.,"Recently purchased a patio set from Lowes during their (Labor day ''sale'', the price is still sale price). Its the Allen + Roth eastfield Loveseat and Coffee table with 2 matching chairs. This cover fit the loveseat like a fitted heavyweight canvas sheet. Cinchable and buckle bottom holds it down tight. I will update this review after a few months with an update. High quality construction, looks like it will last a long time. Wish it was sunbrella fabric, but I imagine that would increase the price dramatically."
5,It Fits!,"My bench is 48"" long and this fits perfectly. The cover seems to be study and I'm sure it will withstand the harsh NE winter. The material is thick and the straps that attach to the legs are holding well.We had a strong storm sweep through last night with gusts of over 50 MPH. This cover didn't move."
5,Bench cover,Well designed bench cover with snaps on the bottom to secure cover to the legs of the bench to protect against wind. Easy to put on and remove. Very attractive and coordinates with other covers for additional patio furniture pieces.
5,Withstands Nor'easter,"The Veranda patio bench cover is of excellent quality. Not only is the fabric attractive, it withstood 50 plus mile an hour winds from the Nor'easter that came through our river house this past week. I will purchse more of this vendors covers for my other outdoor seating pieces. Highly recommend."
2,"Veranda Patio Bench Cover, Fits up to 50"" in length","I ordered 2 for my outdoor loveseats that measure exactly 50"" in length. The packaging states the size is 76"" and they were much too large for a secure fit. Misleading info to say it fits up to 50"" loveseat. Quality seems good, but I am now trying to return and may have an additional shipping fee since this product was not accurately described.Veranda Patio Bench Cover, Pebble, Fits Bench Seats up to 50"" in Length"
5,An excellent look at a very hackneyed subject,"This book is used as a basic text for an Abnormal Psychology class at Harvard. It is an easy read, very interesting and filled with information that makes sense.It takes a very humanizing view to Freud's defenses and shows how that be thought of as good things."
5,Well worth the wait,"The second volume to Bollywood Flashback has been well worth the wait. A perfect marriage of A. Hindi film vocals and B. Blockrockin' dance beats. The downtempo tracks like Noorie and Yeh Resmi Zulfein are sooo beautiful and make you want to pack up for a trip beginning in Morocco and ending up in Jaipur! The uptempo Aja Aai Bahar starts with a New-Orderesque euro-beat before going into full throttle again with THAT gorgeous vocal. The ragga-inflected Sajna Kahe Bhool Gaye and rock n' roller Lal Lal Gal are gems too. The instrumentals make you want to sing along, altogether now: ""Ajaa...."
4,Doll,"This is my daughters first Bratz doll. She loves it.She loves to brush her hair. It's a durable doll & I would sayto moms,""buy it""."
1,"More like ""Nightbore""","This movie is a complete rip-off of Nightmare on Elm Street. A killer kills people in their dreams. A dream psychologist (Elizebeth Hurley) tries to stop him. The only differance is that this movie isn't scary at all. The plot is impossible to follow, and nothing is explained clearly. The cover art may look interesting (especially with Hurley on it) but it is nothing but a huge mess. Steer clear of this one."
1,Total Bedlam,Elizabeth Hurley has made some awful films but this is astonishingly bad. if i were you i would avoid this film at all costs.
4,Her singles 1982 - 1988,"The 28 Songs are all in French. Most of them are typical french ballads.The best ones are ""Hymne a l'amitie"", ""C'est pour vivre"", ""En amour"", ""D'amour ou D'amitie"", ""Ne partez pas sans moi"", ""Mon reve de toujours"", ""A quatre pas d'ici"" and "" Comment t'aimer""""C'est pour vivre"" was recorded with the choir V'la l' bon vent.Celine won the Grand prix D'eurovision 1988 with the song ""Ne partez pas sans moi""."
2,Can we say... cliche?,"If you have nothing better to do than listen to uninspired mind of a main character that leaves you feeling uninspired in the end, go ahead and pick up the book. If rediculous endings do not at all cause uneasiness, go ahead and read it. It wasn't a terrible book by any means, but there's nothing other than an absurd ending that's memorable."
1,"poor quality, poor functionality","I have a wonderful ""Page Up"" which we have had for years, and which does a wonderful job of holding documents in place. I was surprised to see the low price on the ""clown"" Page-Up, bought it and found out that it doesn't do the job. It is about half the weight of the one I have, and tips over easily. It would be helpful if the weight for each of the different Page-ups would be listed."
1,Cute product but it leaks,"Adorable looking hold up - but within a few months of using the hold ups leak. We work with children and purchased seven; unfortunately, we are unable to use them."
4,Kensington Docking Station,"I purchased one a while ago, loved it, but couldn't find it locally. Works just like I expected it to. If you use it for networking, make sure to install the driver. XP will try to auto configured one, but it didn't work on the first docking station I bought. Forget trying to install it later, it's impossible to find it in the USB devices because they all say generic or hub.There is a driver update, it corrects blue screen due to the networking port. Once I installed, problem went away."
3,Good Read but...,"Simply put, its a good read. I always respected Raja Mohans grasp of Foreign policy and defence and he has not let me down this time too. BUT...i was pleasently surprised with his anti-right wing outbursts in the sections of the book. That kind of had a bad after taste.And he never gives enough credit to the BJP govt for their boldness in India's foreign policy. Yes, he does more than mention it but compared to, for example, the Rajeev Gandhi credit giving excercise, it pales into nothing.Compared to Strobe Talbott's Engaging India and Jaswant Singh's Defending India, this one fares lesser. Those books took hold of me right to the very end.But still...dont miss out on this one."
3,One of the better singles from this album,"It helps that this single is the best track off the album, but the bside Big Man is also much better than most of the album material.Not a crucial single to get as Big man was later released on Five Men in a Hut, so one for the completist only."
4,Good s.q. and fast pairing.,"Purchased this set for the spousal unit, but had to do my own quality testing before risking getting my outer extremities amputated by the snarling wiferbeaster from a dud.Sound quality is decent. The controls are very simple, with the main button handling voice command, answer, hang-up and redial. The volume is adjusted with a up down rocker dial.Rated a 4/5 because the sound did have a chop occasionally, but was most likely to do with limits in the bluetooth standards."
3,It works,"This headset works fine. I've heard from several people that while talking on the headset in the car and driving faster than 50 mph that there is a lot of background noise. In otherwords, it's hard to use it on the freeway, which is unfortunate."
2,"Looks nice, but...","This is probably the best looking mandolin available for the price. That said, the playability leaves something to be desired. The notes are oddly difficult to play. As you get up near the 12th fret, the notes get sharper and sharper. At the 12th fret, this mandolin is about 50 cents sharp--a whole quarter tone. If you don't mind the intonation and playability problems, then this is a great mandolin for you. If, on the other hand, you care about such things (and I would hope that you do), I would recommend taking a closer look at some of the other instruments available instead."
3,Decent and Concise,"Author Ken Shoulder provides a nice variety of baseball trivia questions for experts and novices alike. We get both modest and harder-to-answer questions about players, records, teams, etc. Hard-core trivia buffs will know many of the answers from this 2001 effort, and I'd have liked far more questions per team (he provides a few questions for each team). Still, this brief but fun book should be fun reading for fans of our national pastime."
2,Nothing new here,This was an OK trivia book. Standard question-and-answer format of stuff you will find in most baseball trivia books. Mostly run-of-the-mill stuff that I already knew.
2,Received dirty and bent cover,"This book did not say it was used, however appears to be used. The pages were dirty, the cover was bent/torn in two separate places. This was supposed to be a Christmas gift!!! Very Disappointed!!!"
3,Streetwise Manhattan,"This product will be OK, but I had a much better one from the MTA. The map is very small and it is a bit confusing with the bus routes in a different part. Also the writing is very small."
4,Great Map!,"I purchased this map before going to New York on a long weekend. It proved to be very helpful when planning my days, but it was a little too big for in my pocket. It is the size of a standard pamphlet, so it would fit in my back pocket but then stick out of the top. I ended up using the smaller subway map more frequently since it slid all the way in my pocket."
2,Better maps available.,"This map is amazingly unreadable. It's not that it's BAD, it's just that there are MUCH better options available.I would highly recommend the New Yorker's NYC map series."
5,Great cost/benefit,This MAP will help you get where you need most of the time or at a minimum point you to the right direction. Very durable considering how many times it is unfolded and put into a bag or jeans.
4,not bad,"The map does give you everything you would need of a map of Manhattan. But I was disappointed that the bus route map is shown as a smaller condensed map, but not the subway system, which I feel is much more useful."
4,Great map-,"Haven't used it yet for the trip, but it has been very useful for planning! I have used Streetwise before and that's why I bought this one."
4,Great Map!,"This is a great map of the city, easy to carry around. It's plastic, a big plus when it starts raining or if you spill anything on it. My only complain is that it does not include a Subway Map. It has Subway Routes in the map but with all the streets, etc it get a little difficult to make out.Overall, great map. A must have for tourist or anyone new to the city."
5,Best map of New York,"This map helped me get around New York during my recent visit. It is accurate and contains a lot of information. Because it is laminated, it is a durable map and is still in great shape, even after three days of use."
5,Christmas in New York,Ordered several of these. Gave one to each of my adult children so we could go our separate ways if we decided to. These were very helpful in NYC!
3,Kid's Swiss Army Knife,"I bought this for my 5 year old granddaughter to play camp with. She didn't really pay much attention to it as far as I could see. It wasn't the most popular toy she received, but then she had other gifts which may have diverted her attention. Maybe it's more of a boy's toy. I thought it was fun-looking and it worked. Perhaps she'll come around...stay tuned.P.S. The 7 year old sister has begun playing with this toy."
5,Great!,My 7 year old wanted a pocket knife for Christmas but he isn't old enough to be trusted with a real one this worked great considering.
3,unhappy kids,toys is good but did not get the one that is pictured wanted the camping one with the spoon and fork got the utility knife with pliers and screwdrivers instead
3,Too big,Much bigger than expected...thought it was the size of a real pocket knife. But all the accessories are cool. Quick shipping
4,great natural medicine for throat infections,i was trying to find for a long time a homeopathic medicine with Ammonium Chloride and this is so far the only spray available on the market.it is very effective when used for tonsil and throat infections.
5,Incomparable brass playing,"There really are no words to describe this scintillating performance of some of Bach's greatest works.I've been playing trombone for 15 years now (professionally for about 3) and all I can say is they take musicianship to another level. This performance my not be flawless but to my knowledges it's about as close to perfect as mortals can get. If playing like this is found in heaven I think we have a very enjoyable afterlife in stored for us.This LIVE performance may be heard in PCM Stereo, Dolby Digital 5.1 or DTS 5.1. I definitely recommend this for any Bach lover and absolutely urge any brass student or professional to own a copy.They will not disappoint!"
3,Thermos Nissan 16 oz,"While the thermos is constructed well, and it maintains heat and cold temperatures for up to 10 hours, it needs to be at least 22oz. It is too small even for the smallest can of soup! Other than size, it is an excellent thermos for golfers."
2,Leaky,"I couldn't figure out why my daughter's backpack came home drenched with chicken noodle soup until I realized that the top to this was appearing to screw on straight but was actually lopsided and leaving a big gap. I don't know how that happened-- was it not supposed to go in the dishwasher and it melted? Anyway, after only three trips to school I had to throw it away. Big waste. If you buy it check the washing instructions-- could be that it's not dishwasher safe and I didn't notice that. I agree with a previous reviewer-- bring back the old thermos!"
2,"Thermos Element 5 16-Ounce Leak-Proof Food Jar, Gray","I just bought two of the Thermos Element 5 16-Ounce Leak-Proof Food Jar, Gray. It is very sturdy, and nice looking. I gave my son to take to summer school with his mac and cheese. I preped it at 6:45 am with hot water for about 15 mins prior to putting the food in it. By 12 noon, his food was cold. He said that he prefers the THERMOS (smaller one)I had bought for him at Target(19.99). I decided to check it out, and sure enough, it was not warm after 5 hrs. I have read the reviews and they seem all good. I'm just wondering if maybe I just got a bad one. I will have to try the 2nd one. If that one fails as well, I'll return them both."
4,very good product,I bought this for my daughter's friend so she can bring hot food for her luch to school instead just eatting sandwitches. She loves it. It still hot at lunch time.
4,Thermos Nissan,"Best choice available for a small handy Thermos. Best if you keep boiled water and lid closed for few minutes before place in warm food. That will increase the duration of retainer time.Durable and Easy to clean because of wide opening. I got this for my daughter for her school meal and quite satisfied.Sanjeewa ,Torrance CA"
5,"Feelin' Hot, Hot, Hot!!!! stellar thermos!!!","Finally, a thermos that does the job! I heated up soup in the morning - and by noon, it was so hot still that it burned my tongue! I can even make Pizza Bites in the morning and my daughter says that at 12:30, the bites are still quite warm."
2,Has a short life span,"I loved this thermos. I used it mostly for pasta and meat. It kept the food warm all the way until lunch. After about a year of use, I noticed that the outside of the thermos felt warm to the touch (when the hot food was inside). It had never happened before - while the inside was warm, the outside stayed cool. But now, the outside is warm as well - and by lunch time the food is cold. We didn't drop or damage the thermos in any way, but the heat is escaping somehow. What a pity, it was such a great product. When I posted my original review, I gave it 5 stars, but now I have to change it to 2 stars. Works great, but not for long."
4,"Good looking, well sized, efficient thermos",Bought what I was expecting at a right price. No leaks nor dripping and food was fairly warm after about 4 hours.
4,Great Thermo,"We are very happy with this Thermo. My daughter takes it to school early in the morning and she states her food stays very warm and tasty by lunch time. It is easy to carry in the lunch packs. I would have liked it with a wider mouth, but all in all is a good product."
3,Ita just OK,"I had bought a Stanley plastic hot food thermos before and bought this one because the food did not stay hot long enough in the Stanley. I sometimes have to wait 6 hours from prep to eating. I did not find the stainless steel thermos to be any better at keeping food hot. I cannot imagine how luke warm the food would be after 8-9 hours! Not happy, but it appears nothing will keep food as hot as the old glass-lined thermos bottles did!"
3,Good little Thermos,This is a very small thermos...I thought it was bigger. It wont even hold a full can of soup. It is better for hot tea or coffee. I had to buy another one from CVS actually....A Stanley Thermos. If you are looking for a small thermos..this one is ok.
2,Does not keep food hot for up to 10 hours,"I brought this thermos based on all the reviews posted. However, when I got it to pack my husband's lunches since he was unable to heat up his food I was soooo disappointed. We tried this several times where in the morning I would heat up the thermos with hot water, and then pour in the hot food. By lunchtime the food was cold; not even warm...cold. It's been a year of failed attempts. Now we use this thermos to carry room temperature snacks or food we do not need to stay hot. It has not kept any of our hot food warm (not hot) for more than an hour.The thermos is sturdy and a good size, but if you want to buy this to keep food hot up to 10 hours as it advertises-- this is not the one for you. I have not tried storing cold food (it says it will stay cold for up to 12. I'm wary of that as well.)"
4,Not Perfect but Good,"I have used this thermos three times now and have got the same results each time. I have used the items with soups I heated in the microwave for 3-5 min (each time the time was different) and each time I went to eat my soup 6-7hrs later it was still nice and warm but, not piping hot as some reviewers have claimed. My lunch was also left in a climate controlled enviroment so it was not sitting outside in a cold enviroment. I'm not certain it would keep your food warm in such a cold condition but I can't say for sure since I never tried it. I don't see how it could be hot if left in that type of cold temperature setting since it was not hot in a climate controlled setting. I was pleased though to be able to have a warm lunch since I have no access to a microwave at lunchtime. I would recommend this item but, lower your expectations to ""good and warm"" vs ""piping hot"""
4,great thermos!,"I love this thermos, but my only complaint is that I wish it was a slightly weird size, like 16.1 or 16.2 ounces, because when you put a whole can of soup in here to bring with you, it is extremely full and often gets soup inside the lid and along the threads. Otherwise, it keeps soup amazingly warm, especially if you use the trick of putting hot water in the thermos to heat up the metal before you put the soup in."
2,decent size but prone to leaking,"i got one of these (along with a Thermos Stainless Steel Food Container - 10 oz)and am not terribly impressed with it. You have to make sure you seat the lid totally perfectly otherwise it is prone to leaking. I discovered this when taking some chicken broth/noodle soup to work and it seemed like the lid was on correctly, looked right etc... except it leaked all over the inside of my bag -- and this was not the last time. Now. I make sure to tip it over the sink to make sure nothing is dripping out of it.The mouth is a little narrower than I would like as well but it is not the end of the world. Since I have it, i continue to use it, were a friend to ask if they should pick one up for themselves I would suggest the Thermos Stainless Steel Food Container - 10 oz or in a larger size - that one has given me no problems and is much better designed.If the temperamental lid were not an issue I would give it 4 stars (taking one away for the width of the opening)."
1,worthless thermos,"i've been well satisfied with thermos products for over fifty years. i was skeptical when nissan bought thermos a while back, but nissan improved the line substantially. i bought the wide mouth thermos because the wide mouth would allow me to use the bottle for a variety of liquids since it would be far easier to clean: most of my hand fit inside.this product has a top that renders it almost useless: it is very difficult to line the threads up to screw it on correctly; this product lacks an interior stopper so that the exterior cap could be used as a cup. a thermos without a stopper decreases insulation."
3,Smaller than it looks,"It's good for one can of soup. And a normal sized person portion of leftovers. But I am a BIG HUNGRY WORKING MAN, and I would need two or three of these things to feed me. It's also not hot for me. I get up at 5am and put 120 degree tap water in it for 15 minutes to pre-heat the container. I dump that and put my boiling soup or oatmeal, or nucleated leftovers in it. 11am lunch time - food is lukewarm. But the Thermos brand coffee thermos I have stays undrinkably hot for 6 hours."
1,Not Big Enough,"When I order this, I thought it is big. But when I received it, it was not what I expected. If you want this for lunch, this is not the right product."
3,Good could be better,"This jar is great for holding your average 16oz can of soup, ect. Food is still warm after 5 hours. One downfall is the jar opening is smaller and hard to slide food up the side of the thermos using a fork. It's smaller than my previous thermos and decided to take a bowl along to help."
3,Doesn't work very well.,"Keeps food hot for maybe three hours, even with preheating the jar as recommended. By the time I eat lunch, which is six hours after filling it, the food is perfectly bacteria-friendly warm, but not hot by any stretch. The insert says it keeps food hot for 10 hours, which is completely false. Keep in mind I also live in the desert, so it's not as though the jar itself is being exposed to unreasonably cold temperatures."
5,Very good thermos,"I ordered 2 of these for my kids, one is 16 the other 11. They both love them. We make a lot of homemade soup and they like to take it to school for lunch. They are rugged and work very well. The soup is still very hot at the kids lunch hours, so much so that the 11 yr old has asked that his soup not be heated up to high to start. Even after a full day at school if they bring any home it is still warm. I thought at 1st they were a little pricey but now that we have used them for awhile, i think it was well worth it. The opening is large so you can pour things in with out making a mess. It will hold a whole can of soup as well. I am glad we made the purchase."
2,Thermos element jar,"I purchased this item because I wanted to be able to eat hot soup for lunch. This item does not deliver what it promised. I pour my soup in the thermos at 8:00 a.m. but at 12:30 p.m. it is barely warm - not even hot. It is leak proof and keeps the contents intact but I really want some hot soup at lunch time, not some barely warm stuff. Very disappointing."
4,Liked it,Keeps food really warm..perfect size for a lunch box..easy to clean and very durable on construction sitesWould order more of these products
4,Thermos Element,"Just the right size for my workday lunches. Soup, chili, milk for cereal, Hot or cold it works well. Keeps food hot or cold, but I have a question about that - How does it know?Thermos Element 5 16-Ounce Leak-Proof Food Jar"
4,Swingin' Kris Kringle,"If you love the classic big bands and the classic big band tunes, this is the Christmas collection for you. You will enjoy the quotes of the standards throughout these delightful arrangements. This is the CD that I play as I decorate every year!"
4,Great ink...capacity??,"I've been printing photos for the last six months, nearly 1500 so far. I have been using the ""low"" capacity cartridge and just finished up my first ""high"" capacity cartridge. I honestly, didn't notice any difference. The ink is great, quality product here, just didn't get ""more"" for my money."
4,Long time capacity,Much better and longer lasting that the 41--don't bother with the 40s--go for the high capacity
1,Does NOT fit 470 even though Amazon showed it as accessory,"I just bought the Canon MP470, and this was listed as an accessory, so I was dumb enough to buy it without checking the reviews. The Pastor is right -- the 51 cartridge does NOT work on the MP470."
1,canon 51 not compatible as shown,"This cartridge does not work as stated in a canon ip2600. too late to return,"
1,Try it right away.,"Try your cartridge right away. I ordered a Canon CL-51 High-Capacity Color Ink Cartridge. Condition: Refurbished. I didn't need to install it for 10 months. However, when I installed it the printer did not ""recognize"" the cartridge and it would not work. Seller refused to accept my return. I believe the cartridge wouldn't have worked even if I insalled it immediately. Don't waste your money on refurbished Cannon cartride from this vendor, buy a new OEM cartridge!"
2,This does NOT replace the CL-41 cartridge.,"I purchased this as a replacement for the CL-41 ink cartridge for the Canon ip1700 printer. It does not work even though it has been claimed to be a direct replacement. Canon needs to do a better job at making this clear. I'm sure it works fine in another printer, but sadly I will not get to test it. Do not purchase this if you are using it for the Canon ip1700 printer!"
4,Work fine,Work fine. Price is better than at the store. Exactly what I wanted and expected. Not much more to say.
1,Took bad advice from the reviews,"When ordering this product, I took the advice of a review which said the CL-51 held more ink than the CL-41. Unfortunately, my printer required the CL-41 and they are not interchangeable. Now I'm stuck with ink I cannot use and it was a rather costly mistake."
3,Canon CL-51,"Great ink. Price needs to be lower. It's expensive, but do I have a choice? As usual the printer is a good deal @ below $100, but ink is heavily marked up. Oh well ..."
1,Does not work in Pixma printers,"Even though Cannon says this will work, it did not for us. Would not print black, would print all of the colors fine."
4,"Good price, but be careful about the shipping!","This product is offered at a good price, and was labeled as ""free shipping"" on my iphone. I was surprised when my bill included $5.49 for shipping. It turns out the fine print says you have to switch the mode of shipping, which I'm not even sure was option through the iphone Amazon ""PriceCheck"" app. Not happy about that."
5,Canon Ink Cartridges,Price was good considering savings in tax and shipping. Delivery was prompt even though I selected the slower no-charge shipping. Very pleased.
5,Easy to Use,We use this ink and it seems to be great. We get about the number of photos I would expect using this ink. It seems to print fine color photos. It is easy enough to install in our printer that my young son can do it.
4,Ink Review,The ink cartridge was all I expected giving me more printing capacity than the smaller size.The transaction went smooth and quickly.
3,Good Pendant terrible chain,The chain got all tangled and was to fine to untangle and had to be broken off. I would not reccomend this product unless you have a better chain to use.
4,my expectations,I enjoyed reading the book. The only thing was I order it a little to late. It arrived in the time it said and the order of condition was great as well.
1,ibank,I found ibank very difficult to use. Could not find Canadian banks. Definitely a disappointment! I have gone back to Quicken.
1,WASTE OF MONEY!!!,"I thought I was getting a decent program to manage my checking account, HAH! I haven't been able to figure this out and haven't balanced my checking account in months. SAVE YOUR MONEY . Spend a little extra and get Quicken. I wish I did."
2,iBank,I should have check for reviews before ordering.iBank is too confusing vs Quicken. I have not been able to set up as of this time.Regret ordering iBank.
5,Solid Mac app done right,"I really appreciate the attention to detail Igg Software has put into this product. After long months of cursing and struggling with the heaping pile of Java widgets that is Quicken on the Mac, I finally set out across the intarwebs determined to find SOME kind of alternative. I finally found iBank, and man, the difference was like night and day. iBank is actually designed to be--gasp--a Mac program. It has proper search integration, behaves as you expect a Mac program to behave, is stable, imports and exports quickly and easily, and is designed with care.The product has room to grow--reports are currently limited to a single kind, and I think there might be a few high-end features of <shudder> that other program that haven't found their way into this program, but if there are I haven't noticed yet, as I'm too busy doing what I want to do and not cursing at my computer any more.Definitely recommend."
4,IBank review,"Good product with a slightly difficult learning curve for a 72 yo - even though I've been using Apple computers since 1984! Customer service is wonderful, fortunately."
2,It ain't Quicken for Windows...That's for sure!,"It may be the best there is for MAC, but boy-oh-boy, is it a bear to use. Why didn't they just buy or copy Quicken for Windows as old as the year 2000 version. It just did everything easier. Check printing is a major chore...you have to manually setup the print onto your check stock. Entering transactions is tedious...no rapid entry windows for that task. Reconciling with a bank statement is absolutely difficult, with no intuitive end point upon a successful balancing of the account. Might be worth buying the Windows emulator just to use a ten year old version of Quicken! This iBank has a long way to go."
2,Acceptable - maybe,I read all of the reviews I could find of personal finance programs for the Mac and concluded that this was the best choice. That may well be true but after a month of using it I have decided to revert to my old copy of Quicken on an old PC. I found it harder to generate the kind of printed reports that I want using iBank and also harder to reconcile my checking account than with Quicken. The pie charts generated by iBank are certainly colorful and they update in a visually attractive way - but I do not find this eye candy to be useful.
1,It's no MS Money,"I had online bill pay before there was an internet; remember Managing Your Money with CheckFree? I've been using various personal finance programs for over 20 years so judge my remarks in that light. I was hoping to move towards PC freedom with this product. The latest version of iBank will not run on OS 10.4 Tiger. The older version was included, but it was pretty lame. No online updating of accounts was my main complaint. The rest seemed clunky too, but that may have just been the learning curve. I sent mine back. If you have a later (Leopard) OS, this may work for you, but I hated it."
2,"Bought it, then abandoned it.","Like many others, I had Quicken 2006 for Mac and wanted an update, but nothing new enough from Quicken was available yet, so I tried iBank. It did not function easily, and some things were frustratingly confusing, like reconciling. It was so frustrating I went back to Quicken 2006 and never used iBank again. I really wanted to like this product, but it just didn't work for me."
1,Awful Mac App.,"Read Jan McAfee's review of iBank. (S)he is exactly right.I also switched from PC to Mac, and I was also looking for an alternative to Quicken for Mac because the reviews of the Mac version were so negative.But iBank is NOT the answer. It flat out stinks, especially for anyone who used Quicken or Money on a PC.I love my Mac, and I know it was slightly heretical to partition my hard drive to install Windows. But there are still two programs without Mac equivalents that I still need to run. One is Money. (iBank was THAT bad)."
3,didn't do what I wanted,"It looks really neat. But I wanted to import my last years and years from quicken. So far, I have not been able to do that. The import box comes up, but NOTHING happens. I haven't really been able to use it for my banking yet."
5,Very satisfied,Looked for a while to find the right substitute for Microsoft Money. This does the job!
1,Buyer Beware,"Buyers should be aware that there are issues downloading information from individual banks. Before buying the product one should visit the company website and see if your institutions are supported. Also, if you buy the software from the software company site they offer a 30 day money back guarantee. If you buy the CD from Amazon....like I did to save $10....you own it no matter what!Buyer beware!!!!!!"
1,Not ready for prime time,"I purchased the latest version because I read terrible things about Quicken. I have several problems including:incorrect amounts (different from what I typed) entered into the ledgercheck numbers off by onecolor coding inaccurate - the same color appears for different categoriesThis has increased the time it takes to enter information, since I need to check - and often edit- information that has been previously entered.I used to send ""bug reports"" but I noticed that after the first or second (consecutive) day, that I didn't receive responses - and I grew tired of sending in multiple reports on a daily basis.Like I said - not ready for prime time. The current version is more like .8 Beta."
3,"Great for Mac, needs more on-line banks","So, I do most of my on-line banking through an institution that iBank doesn't work with but Quicken does :-(I really like the interface, and it works so well with the Mac, and none of the Quicken slowdowns, etc. But I do on-line banking because of the convenience and if iBank cannot interface directly with the institution, that ain't too convenient! I haven't yet decided if I'll just write off the 48-bucks for iBank, or if I'll breakdown and just use it manually for that institution..."
4,IBank is easy to use,"Having just switched from a PC to a MAC, I need a product to help me do my taxes. I'm a self-employed management consultant and used Quicken to keep track of my business expenses. After reading the reviews of Quicken for the MAC I decided to give iBank a trial. It is not as sophisticated as Quicken for the MAC but it is easier to use.So far it is adequate for my purposes. I was able to download from my Citibank account and set up all of the expense categories I need. The real test will come when I try to export my data to Schedule C in TurboTax."
3,JUST ENOUGH NOT TO SWITCH TO A WINDOWS PRODUCT,"I ordered this because i wanted to stick with mac ""everything"" it's just okay, im going to keep it, but compared to ms money, it's not even in the ball park. Needs work. It's to 'quacky. although I think there on the right track. you have to use it for a week or so to get the hang of setting up, entering debits/credits. I hope they have an upgrade soon. i'm using ver 3 the latest version as of 7/31/2008. this program should be at least 15.00 dollars cheaper. try it for 30 days free before you buy it. if you had ms money and think this is even close forget it."
1,Awful,That should be a (-) star. I loaded this program 4 times and tried to get it to import properly both from a QIF file and from the online sources for financial and banking - never even close though my net worth increased by 15 million dollars.Basically it just doesn't work for any type of entry or transaction.
1,1 STAR much too generous for this dog,"The MAC is a beautiful computer, sleek and fast. Unfortunately the installed software nor the software written for the MAC is very good. Should you choose to buy iBANK do yourself a favor and enter your income and expenses into both your PC's financial software as well as iBANK for a few month. Compared to the PC Quicken version, iBANK is very cumbersome and inefficient and after three month iBANK crashed! If anyone cares to try iBank you can have mine real cheap."
1,Downloads not supported by major banks,"I was disappointed to learn that iBank is not supported by one of the largest banks in the U.S., JPMorgan Chase, and you cannot do direct downloads without paying a monthly fee to the bank. You can only download monthly statements. If you monitor your banking activity on a weekly or greater basis, this is a real pain."
1,Cannot import large QIF from Quicken for Windows accurately,"I have some 16 years of Quicken for Windows data. Most of the imported data showed the wrong account balances and many of them had dates for account entries that hadn't even arrived yet in the month. The interface has these large icons all over the page, which I find to be distracting and kind of amateurish. The text size is too large. You're supposed to have 30 days to evaluate it, but I saw one warning window indicating I could use it for 15 minutes. I assume that was 15 minutes at a time but not sure. All in all, not worth the huge price for the application."
1,Software was outdated,When I ordered the software from Amazon I assumed it was the latest version 4. Unfortunately there was no description stating what version it was and when I got it I found out it was the old version 3 software so I returned it. I'm surprised that Amazon is selling outdated software!
4,Could this happen???,"Like the other reviewers I enjoyed this book although I found it a bit hard to get started pick it up and put it down a couple times then finaly got into it. The description on the apparent intentional distoration of fact by the media is correct just look at how they presented Viet Nam. Also the Congressional characters seem to be some of those that we see on TV trying to push their own agendas today. However, once this guy got started with his mission the action really got with the program. I think he is a very good follow up for Bond and Helm and I hope to see more of him. There are some typo etc errors that should have been corrected if Amazon had a good proof reader but it doen't distract from the story line, I just glossed over them."
5,Black Ops: American Jihad,The author has done a great job taking one of his western characters and bringing it into today's world of conflict. It was one of his best. I could not put it down once I started reading. I hope this is the beginning of a new character.
5,"Novus Plastic Restoration Kit, 8 ounces","I have used this product to polish plastics by hand, using the old elbow grease method or by using an orbital buffer. The product seems to contain a small amount of lubricant to prevent burning the plastic, which is good. It always a good idea to put your hand behind the material being polished to prevent unnecessary bending and cracking. These products are very good, you won't regret it."
1,HORRIBLE and RUINS your product.,"I searched long and hard for a product whose title was, ""Plasma tv screen scratch repair"" and I thought I had found it. If you type that phrase in the Amazon search bar, this product is the first product to appear.Great reviews so I figured, this is finally it.I got it in the mail from Amazon and read and reread the instructions and what happens? Scratches still there and my screen is ruined! It takes the protective coating off of the screen and does nothing for the scratches.No customer service from Amazon as this is from a third party seller. I have contacted the manufacturer and was basically told that I have to contact the distributor... after contacting them, I get an automated email telling me to contact Amazon.com.I am SOOOOOO Not happy!"
1,Do Not Use on Blackberry Screen,"Other forums noted that this would help get scratches out of the Blackberry screen. It did not. In fact, it put additional scratches in the screen which distort the display. I would strongly suggest that this product not be used on display screens of any kind.The documentation received with the product is just a brochure and does not mention how it works on display screens. This is a major flaw in the instructions provided with the product."
3,Product does work,"I would have initially gave this product five stars if I received it. But I didn't. Never the less, I've used this product before whereI used to work maintenance. I was amazed at how well it really worked, when using all three stages of the product. I startedwith stage 3, repeated, used stage 2, repeated, then finished with stage 1. the results were absolutely fantastic. As I saidbefore, I would have given this product five stars, if I have received the order but, I didn't."
1,scratched sunglasses,"We receive sunglasses by the box,a few have minor scratches. The polish from 1 to 3 did little, but not enough to make them sell able. I believed in the product and ordered two sets to receive free shipping (orders over $25.00). The product did not help and I was charged shipping."
5,"Tres éfficace, facile d'emploi.","Pour les modeles a coller en plastique ,les 3 sont tres utiles . J'ai plusieurs vieux modeles et avec Novus ca leur redonne une tres belle apparence, Un collectionneur de trains et voitures de course me les avait conséiller. Je les conseille aussi .AAAAAAAAAAA+++++++++++++ Merci"
2,Novus Polish Kit review,I followed the instructions to the tee with the attempt of getting the haze out of my Isinglass. My work was not successful and very disappointing.
5,Great Product,"It does exactly what is says it will do. I am an artist and I use it to polish the ""glass"" (plexi) on the things I frame, and they always look great."
4,Novus #2,Only used #2 but worked like a charm. Greatly reduced the scratch although did not remove it. Definitely would recommend.
5,Excellent Polish Kit for iPhone and More!!,Great product. I bought this product to fix a deep scratch in my iPhone. It worked extremely well and you can't even tell it was scratched. I also had several DVDs and CDs that numerous scratches and had problems playing. After using the polish they worked perfectly.
4,did a good job,"I needed it to clean up our iphones and it did a good job. Have not used it on anything else, but it looks like it will do the job"
4,Needs Elbow Grease,This product works and will reduce and remove scratches. It just requires a lot of elbow grease. You are going to need time and patience. I used this on a dell mini 910 and a white macbook. It did the job just required a long time rubbing the compounds.
4,Does the job,Used properly this product works well on plastic windows. I have 2 Jeeps and with a little polishing the windows look like new.
3,Sorta works,"Well, what can I say? It sorta works. Tried it on my cell phone, and my TV bezel.The small friction scratches on the back of my phone were lightened slightly, but are still noticeable. However, this WAS able to fill in some of the deeper gouges from fall damage on my phone's front bezel. They are still obviously there, but it filled them in a bit and fixed the color (was gray from being smashed in by the drop, now black like the phone's color).The TV, it did nothing for. The marks are still just as noticeable as before.The process for this is a little complicated, and requires a good hour or so to do properly, something that isn't good for someone like me who is completely impatient to see if new products work. The creams will also get stuck in small spaces like on a cell phone, so be prepared to have an amazing clean up job afterwards."
3,third year EE major,"This book is quite helpfull but you have to work at getting the information out of it. Tinder had me until we hit mixed variable logic with K-mapping. That area needs work; too many diagrams and not enough explaination. I have to say though, this is a hard topic to teach to someone who has never seen this material before."
2,Does not deliver,"This book is frustrating. The preface states that all end-of-chapterproblems are bundled on the included CD. But, there are none on theCD. Also two ""powerful tools"" are supposed to be included on the CD. BOOZER is included but you are directed to go to the manufacturer's website. Tinder does a poor job of relating the information in a way useful to a beginner."
2,"Flashlight poorly made, otherwise good tool","I own several other Swiss-tech tools, and love them all. This is my only disappointment. I bought one of these for me and one for my dad based on how much I like their other stuff. My flashlight does not work well, can't get the circuit to stay completed because of flimsy plastic construction. My dad's won't work at all. I'd stay away from this one in favor of their other, all-metal offerings, which are excellent, especially the utli-key, which is brilliantly designed."
1,DON'T JUDGE THIS HORRIBLE VIDEO BY ITS COVER!,"Like the other films released by this company, I bought this DVD and was apalled to learn that this is simply re-packaged OLD NASA FILM with a misleading new cover. These 1960's-70's-era films are garbage, with bad picture, bad sound, and narrators so terrible that you expect to hear a projector start skipping, just like when you were a kid in elementary school. Shame on this company. There are many excellent space videos out there--and this IS NOT ONE OF THEM."
4,great book on important subject,"Very enjoyable. Tells stories of different ppisoners from many regions from singapore to burma. Not very many details left out and a page turner. Instaed of dry books that just go over details and important events, book focuses on actual accounts of individuals. Helps you to better understand the events on a human level instead of reducing the people to statistics."
4,Tankless water heater,"I'm impressed with the tankless water heater, but must say that if I had know what I know now about the installation I would have thought twice about purchasing it. My old water heater vented with 3"" vent. This unit take 5"" and above 2000 ft elevation you must vent with 6"". I'm just under 4000 ft. So you must install new vent up through the roof. The unit uses more gas, but for a much shorter time, so it must have 3/4 inch gas pipe plumbed to it. All in all quite a bit of work, but I'm sure it will pay for itself in the long run. I did all the labor, if someone had to pay a plumber to install the product it would be a much longer time before it would pay for itself!"
1,Unreliable & too much maintenance,"Don't do what I did. Read the manual BEFORE you purchase. It turns out that the water valve must be re-built every two or three years. If you are not handy, that's expensive. If the set screws are frozen, it's extremely expensive. If I were doing it again, I would look for a tankless that required less maintenance.Addition to my original review: After just a couple of years, the water heater only works intermittently, and we are replacing it with a Rinnai."
5,Makes photographs look like a paiinting.,"I find that this paper has done a good job, once I understood what to ""tell"" my printer about the type of peper I was putting in and the type of print quality I needed. It was a bit expensive to experiment on the first few pictures, but well worth the effort. I find it makes pictures architecture in them look particulary good. I have some street scenes of San Francisco in my office that visitors insist are paintings. I've bought about five boxes now and have been happy each time. I recommend you keep the paper in sealed containers if you live somewhere hunmid, like here in Florida. I swear the himidity got to some of the prints that I'd left sitting out on my desk and resulted in some changes that caused the paper to swell up which resulted in the printer leaving roller marks."
5,Love this paper. Easy to use and works well in inkjet printer.,"Love it! Works great in my 10 year old, medium priced, inkjet printer. Printed photos are far superior to any supermarket/drugstore type printing. Best of all, when I print a copy of my great grandma's photo that was originally taken 75 years ago. The copy looks authentic and much better than original.Impressive!"
2,Overpriced,"I have no idea why I thought I was getting 3 candles (maybe the picture shown?). I got one at the price I could have gotten it at locally, making the purchase & shipment silly."
2,"Expensive product, so and so quality","After the raving reviews this product has, I was expecting something different. The candle arrived poorly packaged, it already contained a dint; then it needed trimming, as the base had so many wax bumps that the candle wasn't steady. Then it needed more trimming! - as the candle burns, it creates a hollow in the middle and some 'walls' around which start to melt and make a mess. And last but not least, the price seemed a rip off to me: $8.55 for ivory, compared to $3.50 the white one?! I will never again buy from this seller; actually, I'm planning a trip to Ikea to stock up on candles."
5,A HEALTHY way to lose weight,"First off, the F2 diet is healthy! The soup and salad recipes provided will improve your digestive health whether or not you intend to lose weight.The advice for losing weight is practical, not draconian. If you are aware of how much fat and calories is in the food you eat, and how hunger and digestion work, you can make intelligent decisions and balance your desire for food with your weight loss goals. If you regularly replace meals with the F2 soups and salads, you will consume fewer calories without feeling deprived.I don't follow the diet plan, but I use the advice, fat counters, and recipes to help me make sensible choices, and I'm slowly but steadily losing weight without feeling like I'm ""on a diet"". Brilliant!"
1,Senior Network Consultant,"I found the Wifi Finder to be totally unreliable and definetely not worth the money. I tried it in my office, about six feet from a wireless b/g router and it responded as if it did not see a wireless network. I tried it in the field along side of my wireless PDA and found it found networks only about 10% of the time while the signal measurement on the PDA was accurate. The product was a disappointment and I would not recommend it at all."
1,It's a waste of money,The only way I could get it to detect a wireless network is if I was standing three feet away from the router or access point. I got it to help me locate or identify rogue access points on customer networks but now I wish I could get my money back on this worthless device.
1,Garbage,This is a worthless piece of equipment. False readings and failure to recognize even strong signals. Does't tell you anything about the signal. There are other sniffers out there that tell you if the signal is encrypted or not. I had one of these for a few months before the handle broke and I was glad to get rid of it. Useless thing. Spend a few more dollars and get one that tells you more about the signal. If I could have I would have given this zero stars.
1,Does Not Work,"I agree with dond7163 from Lackawanna, New York. The manufacture did not recognize my email, even tho they have a nice page on their web site for feedback. The device did not detect my Belkin or NetGear APs configured without any security measures."
2,The Microwave Finder,"Bought the product thinking it would be a cheap good wifi finder. The bottom line is that, similar to other reviews, it takes forever to find networks. A plus though is that if you are near a running microwave, it gives you an immediate 3 lights. So if your looking to put the hot in hotpocket, this product will do the trick. It does work so I can't bash it that much. If you have the patience, this product will be ok for you."
5,This Kensington WiFi Finder is Fast and easy to use.,"I'm Happy that I bought this Kensington WiFi Finder because it is easy to use and Fast to detect a connectionwhich is better than turning on my laptop, waiting for it to load to see if there is connection in my area.I'm glad that I bought this little gadget."
2,Not worth money,"Interesting product, but it doesn't work well enough to be of use. I've only been able to consistently pick up a signal within 30 feet of the base station, it doesn't alert you to WEP-encrypted networks, and it doesn't seem to pick up any 802.11g networks. But it has picked up some networks for me (I picked up three with this just walking down the street, though it was not reliable in controlled environments), and the dim LED issue is a non-event (come on, people, just cover the light with your hand, you can see them)."
2,I'm beginning to feel the same way,These guys are right I've been working on a project for quite a while I tried to transfer it to AVI and I lost all of it.It took so much time that I'm workin on a MPEG version.I'll let you know how it goes.
1,Not ready for prime time,Software crashs often using Windows XP. The worst piece of software I have ever purchased. Ended up with Sony Screenblast 3.0 which works great.
5,This man is amazing,"Nathan Haines is a diversely talented musician. As well as writing songs, he plays flute and saxophone and even sings on a few tracks.This album is a little kooky, but I love it!And he's from New Zealand!Trivia: Nathan played on Jamiroquai's new album Dynamite (Track: ""Talullah"")."
2,Worked great for a whole day.....,I had purchased this to notch steel tubing. The teeth didn't get dull like other hole saws but the teeth did start ripping off one by one until there were none. I guess it is back to Milwaukees.
4,"there's plenty to enjoy here on the obscure live release by ""hag""","a lot of tasty instrumental work in the style of 'western swing', the genre that predated country music. a lot of cool merle song's such as 'okie from muskogee' and a smokin cover of johnny cash's 'folsom prison blues'. his backing band is stellar."
3,Kelvin (Hong Kong),"The content of book is unbalanced. Too little on post WWII period. The three chapters on German armored organization is excellent and enable us know deeply on German panzer division and remove some traditional but incorrect view e.g. The reduction of one tank regiment in Panzer division is bad thing in traditional view but author adjust this. But during the cold war, only some about Middle East or Korean armored warfare but nothing on US armored division or Soviet tank/motor rifle divisional organization.It is disappointing."
1,Within Arm's Reach,OK so was I the only one that thought this novel was depressing? I found the characters to be weak individuals and all frightened of each other; they have to tiptoe and walk on eggshells at every turn. Who has that many regrets and self doubts about EVERY SECOND of their lives? Not the enjoyable summer reading I was expecting. Do not bother with this one!! If I could this would get zero stars
3,"Reads well, but sentimental","This novel is a cross between literature and a soap opera, in that there is constant character drama, and often some terrible decisions being made, but if you are able to suspend disbelief the characters are likable and will draw you through it. Basic plot: members of a family look over three generations and try to discover love. Artistic content: some transcendent realization outside of form. Is it good? Yes, it's good - not great. It's very easy to read, although the latter half of it has some sections that need to be skimmed for their utter lack of relevance. Napolitano uses common English to craft an inoffensive narrative. I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone wanting mainstream literature, with the caveat that it does wax sentimental quite frequently."
1,Soap-Opery Tale - Unrealistic Characters,"The first 1/3 of this book was just fine. The characters were portrayed realistically, with subtle enough evidence that this family was not what it appeared to be. Then the characters-mostly the female ones took 360 degree turns that were so unrealistic they became laughable, or at least shake one's head vigorously. When I reached for this book at my Barnes and Noble, it literally was within arm's reach (it was on the highest shelf). Frankly, I wish is was unreachable, I might have found a better book that day."
4,"Entertaining read, typical soap-opera type novel","Within Arm's Reach is a fictional novel set in New Jersey and told from the view points of six different people. Of course everyone is dealing with their past as well as the problems of the present. An Irish-American Catholic family, they are thrown into a crisis when unmarried Gracie becomes pregnant. The author does an excellent job of walking the reader through the maze of complex relationships between the characters as each shares their life story and point of view. For readers who thrive on a well-written family saga and the typical soap opera fare they will enjoy Within Arm's Reach and find it a recommended read."
2,"Decent espresso, cheaply made","I had this machine for 2 years. It went back once under warranty and was repaired (after much reluctance from the manufacturer), and today it officially died. I used it once a day. It made decent espresso, the auto tamper was nice, but there are too many extraneous moving parts which make it feel very cheap. And it is - the swivel top broke and it is going in the trash and I will spend more for a Gaggia."
4,You're gonna need one of these.,When connecting single walled pipe to double at the ceiling support this connection is necessary to make the connection leak free and avoid creosote from dripping out. This sleeve fits inside the single wall black pipe and gives you the needed play to connect the black pipe to your stove properly. I only gave it 4 starts because 5 means you really love the thing. And frankly this is a piece of pipe. But it dies it's job perfectly.
4,RECOMMENDED FOR NEWCOMERS TO ORACLE,"Oracle can be quite intimidating to the uninitiated. Anyone undertaking work in this environment for the first time needs a friendly and helpful companion, and Understanding the Oracle Server fits the bill admirably. Studying this book in conjunction with the definitive technical documentation from Oracle Corporation has enabled me to gain a deeper appreciation of Oracle than any other database product I've used in my 25+ years in the computing industry. Although slightly dated now, this book is remarkable in that it still manages to achieve nearly everything it sets out to. Thoroughly recommended."
1,Not for Database Professionals,"I bought this book to get a thorough grounding in the basics of Oracle architecture and administration. Unfortunately, this book supplies merely a cocktail-partyish knowledge of Oracle. The author mentions the major points, but she goes on to another subject before she tells you anything practical. You might sound like you know what you're talking about, but you won't know what you're doing. This book may serve well as a primer for someone who has no previous experience with a relational database, perhaps on a High School level. I pity the business that relies on someone whose only knowledge of Oracle comes from this book. For just a few extra dollars, you can buy something longer that 170 pages. If you are actually going to use Oracle, you will need it."
4,Mom Knows Best?,My first Triple Crown book and I'm impressed. What it lacks sometimes in literary flair is more than made up for with energy. Can't wait for round two: Hustler's Grandson. Just read another solid urban fiction work: Hideaway. Check it out.Hideaway (Jammed Up) (Hot Flash)
4,Truely Is A Hustler's Son,This book was a page turner had me turner page after page waiting to get more and more drama.I finally got to read a T. Style book and have to say great book can't wait to get part 2 to this book and more of other books by T. Style.Overall book was about Kelsi and his mother Janet that just trying to make it no matter what. Even if that means killing.Janet starts opening up to her son Kelsi little by little when she finds out more about her son ways when he come to her to tell her he killed this boy Charles his girlfriend Keisha's ex.After that just to keep there secret more blood had to be shred in order to keep they secret. Of who Janet really is and about what her son did to protect himself.At the end it all boiled down to you can't trust everyone you have in your life.Now I see that part 2 Kelsi will truely have to know who he can't trust in his corner.Overall great book totally want to read part 2.:)
2,Not good at all,This book was crazy and all over the place. I would not recommend this book to anyone it was far to unrealistic. The mother went from normal and sane Mother to crazy pysho killer mother in a couple pages.
3,The title does not prepare you for this book,I liked the way the title leads you to think this book is another gangster book but it definitely takes another road. You wouldn't think its the mother with all the game I didn't like her helping her son kill or even suggesting the next victim. I think K-man was a good kid just becoming a man and with the right guidance could have become productive instead seems to me he became a serial killer the first murder was self defense but the rest well lets just say read it and see what you think it's always another way to look at any situation Maybe it had to be this way or maybe not either way I recommend it because I know the sequel is gonna be HOT (Better be a sequel).
1,Literary at its worse,"I was suprised to see how many people enjoyed this book. It was horrilbe, unrealistic, and painfully boring. I had to force myself to finish just to make sense of this senseless garbage."
3,Raw & Gritty,"A Hustler's Son was a pretty good book filled with shady characters, violence and sex. The characters made poor choices with their lives and ultimately paid the price for their actions.I enjoyed the raw, deliberate style in which the characters spoke. I like that the author spoke well in the voice of a 15 year old male."
4,towel bar,it worked for our bathroom had a hard time finding it in local stores so we ordered it online and it worked
2,Had some dings,I really thought the phone was brand new. It had some dings on the side and looked a little worn. Disappointing.
4,Mariah Does it Again!,"Mariah has another smash single but this time with the help of rappers Jay-z and Da Brat.Track Listings.1.) Heartbreaker (radio edit f./ Jay-Z)2.) Heartbreaker (remix f./ Da Brat)1.) Review - This version is great Jay-z is awesome, he keeps it fresh and new and adds so street creds. to the song2.) Review - o.k. I personally don't like Da Brat. I think she is annoying and her voice is that of a dead penguin. no one likes her, and no one ever will. But Mariah is still great."
1,"""Heartbreaker"" is just a re-hash of another Mariah Song","Millions of people have purchased Mariah's Cd's. But this one is a real waste. Mariah Carey is very talented, but ""Heartbreaker"" is just a re-hash of her ""Fantasy"" single. After having a break for a while, one would think an artist would have time for new material and new ideas. But don't waste your money on this one."
2,Pleasant fluff,"I saw the video for this single on MTV. The song sounds like a lot of her old material. The only reason I even gave the mediocre song a chance was because the video was witty and fun(takes place at movie theatre where Mariah is getting back at an old boyfriend). If she wants to continue to waste her voice on these fluffy, formulaic songs, more power to her. I doubt I'll be buying the album when it comes out."
3,Buy the single.,"This single is worth listening to! I like the rap artists that appeared on the remix version. This is a must buy for all the Mariah Carey's fans. Also to the reviewer, Joshua Howell of Haines City, Florida. Just because women disagree on what Ms.Carey is wearing. It doesn't always mean that they are jealous or can't fit into those tight clothes!! I am a size 4,beautiful,a natural 34c,and I'm only one year older than Mariah Carey!!! So there,Mr. Howell!! not all women are jealous of MC!!!"
5,heartbreaker is the coolest!,"well no one can deny that Mariah is the best, she did it once and she did it again...with heartbreaker as her 14th number 1 song in the billboard and with heartbreaker, sitting at the top position for the 2nd week, mariah created 2 miraculous fantasy; the only female singer with the most among of number 1 song on the billboard and also the only recording artist that spend the most week at the number one position, and she even outdone the beatles, can we consider this album a flop, definitely not! the junior remix is great and the mtv is superb...wonderful music with beautiful mtv, a match made in heaven...hope mariah can continue to shine and rise like a flying butterfly!"
1,This is Fantasy #2. It is actually the same song.,What a lazy and uninspired songwriter. She is not using her brain to write this song. What on earth to produce same song twice.
4,Not Worth It,"I LOVE Mariah, she's my idol, but this CD isn't really worth it. On the ""Rainbow"" album we already get an awesome remix of ""Heartbreaker"" featuring Da Brat and Missy Elliot. But this is one of her best songs."
3,buy the album,this contains the album version and remix version of heartbreaker but then both of these appear on her rainbow album. so buy this single if you're a collector only.
4,Heartbreaker is a great song!,I have listened to that song over and over and I haven't gotten bored of it yet! I really like that song. I am in to pop and rap if you are too you will most likely love this song!
4,An artist who has dedicated much time and love to her music.,"A lot of people have started hating on Mariah, but I have always had this special interest in her music. Those who hate on her, are those who are only focused on what others have said about her. No one has ever said that just because you dress a certain way, that it affects your music. I think Mariah has thought a lot about what she want's to do as an artist and as her own being. Mariahs' music has always pulled me in, and her new Heartbreaker CD, will be mine soon enough. I recommend it to those who like this style of music. She has always surprised me in every CD, and I'm positive I'll enjoy Heartbreaker!"
3,"A poor remake of Mariah's own ""Fantasy""","Mariah, once again, it trying to shed her sweety girl image with hard core hip hop sounds mixed with rap. She has chosen to sample the same song as in her 1995 hit ""Fantasy."" I would choose the original 1995 ""Fantasy"" over this mediocre effort."
4,A great Lenten read,"A good introduction and reflection on the Lenten journey within the Orthodox Church. As with some of Fr Hopko's other books, I would like more detail at times. Yet there is plenty from the hymography and Saints of the Orthodox Church to satisfy."
3,"Aww, so close and yet","Gotta agree with the previous review, although I am glad someone recognized the brilliance of Percy's work enough to try to re-record his charts. Faith was a master of this genre of orchestral pop music. And Columbia (Faith's label) was no slouch at recording so it IS a pity we can't have more of those original masters reissued to CD. The main benefit here is the digital technology available for the new recordings. I salute Ranwood for putting up the bucks to hire a full orchestra -- that couldn't have been cheap. But my, how Percy's personal touch (and his recording team?) is missed! These tracks would NOT have won the kudos Percy's original recordings did."
5,"Fantastic latin rhythms by the master, Percy Faith","I am at a loss to why some reviewers have rated this CD so low; maybe their CDs were defective. I bought my CD in 4/09 and it is absolutely fantastic! It's impossible to sit still while it's playing; it makes you want to dance, even if you can't dance! I have it in my CD changer in the car and plan to get another one for in the house. The sound is marvelous and the selections are great. I am not an audiophile, but love music and this album of latin rhythms is outstanding played on a stereo CD player. Please, don't be influenced by the negative reviews, there are not enough reviews to give a balanced opinion on this wonderful recording. My parents had the original album on vinyl and this CD is so much better. Buy it--you will not regret it!"
1,Not Percy Faith,"I thought I was getting tracks from original Percy Faith albums. When they didn't sound very good I thought it was because of poor engineering. It wasn't until I finally read the notes inside the booklet and discovered in the very last paragraph that this is a recording of his arrangements by another orchestra, NOT by Percy Faith himself. Very shoddy/ deceptive packaging and Amazon should not list it among the genuine Percy Faith reissues without a disclaimer"
1,NOT compatible with modern computers,"works great until you get a modern computerwon't work with Windows 7, 64 bitFind something newer, or you end up stranded like I"
1,Beware! Not for 64-bit operating systems!,"Nowhere on the box does it say that it does NOT work with 64-bit Windows systems. Not until you've spent your money and have probably wasted an hour or two working this the device do you learn that there are no 64-bit drivers. You even have to search the Internet to find out they have no intention of creating a fix or workaround. It might be a gem, but there's no way I can find out and now I'm stuck with it. It seems they're discontinuing it (Office Depot has dropped it from their inventory, but that's not a final indicator), so beware: Yet another unusable legacy device in a shrink wrapped box. Boooo!"
3,Card sensor is problematic,"Reader did not reliably sense insertion of card. Called Cardscan (CS) customer service. Was on infinite hold. Returned to Amazon for replacement. Replacement had same insertion issue and drive motor made lots of noise. Returned replacement. CS sent me email saying to insert at angle; helped a little. Card sensor is an issue. When it senses card, it works (scan/OCR) fine."
1,CardScan Personal,Terrible - it did horrible scanning business cards and eventually stopped working. CardScan did an excellent job trading out the bad one and I upgraded to the business one.
1,The thing was broken,The CardScan arrived as ordered and after trying it on 2 different computers determined it was broken. I hate buying stuff on the computer when it arrives broken. Fortunately Amazon does a great job of return items and I will be getting my money back when they receive the broken CardScan. I will be looking for a different brand.
1,Good software. Very poor engineering quality contral,"I had a Cardscan 60 business card scanner for several years. The reading mechanism failed and would no longer read name cards. I assumed a new scanner would be problem free. Not at all. I received my new scanner today. The reader would not even read the calibration card!A good software cannot rescue Cardscan from very poor engineering quality control... and a rapidly deteriorating reputation, as I noticed from others with experiences identical to mine. Do not waste your time nor Amazon.com's money on shipping cost of returns and office costs of refunds."
3,Did not work with Windows Vista,"The CardScan Personal V8 I purchased does not work with Windows Vista, so it could not be used on my computer. The good news is the vendor I purchased it from was excellent and worked with me to return the item."
2,Returned this item,This cardscan wasn't compatible with Windows Vista 64 bit which I didn't see noted at all when I ordered it. I had to return it and went to the company directly to order the right one for me. What a pain!
3,Good Enough,"I have found this product to be very easy to use and the results are sufficent for the cost of the item. The first one I purchased did not work. I called the tech support number and got through right away. I described the problem and they said to return it to where I had bought it. The return process with Amazon was extremely easy and they sent me a replacement before I could even get the faulty one back to them. The replacement worked great and I have scanned in a lot of cards that were just floating around my desk. All the cards I had been ""planning"" on entering by hand into Outlook. All done in less than an hour. I like this device."
3,No Vista 64 Support,"I am sure it works quite well, I am sure it is great, just don't get it if you have a 64bit version of Vista because they do not support it and have no plans to create a driver for Vista64. I checked for compatability and right here it says, works with Vista.Here is my note from tech support:The 60ii is not supported on 64-bit systems. We're sorry for any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused. There is no current plan to develop a 64-bit driver for the 60ii. A follow-up model, which will be called the 62, will have 64-bit support but the timeline for its release is indefinite. Also, it will simply be inserted in identical Personal edition boxes as the 60ii is phased out, so you will have no way to spot it when it hits the shelves."
3,Will not work with Windows 7 64 bit,"I can't really comment on the scanner because it wouldn't work with my 64 bit system. However, when I contacted the manufacturer they (dymo)were amazing and helped me make sure I had everything I need to get the correct scanner working. I will absolutely buy dymo products again."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS! Bad product/bad customer support,"I received the Cardscan for a birthday present in October of '08. I was overseas on an assignment when I first tried to use it and it would not even scan a single card.I contacted customer support but they were completely worthless and could not help me. I told them about me being overseas and they ceased communication with me.In the end, I ended up just throwing the thing away.Don't get ripped off!"
3,Cardscan Personal,"It is far from 100%. I would say, half the card I have to make some sort of edfit to get the information right. Better than typing it all in, but not as good as they claim. Realtor, with a stack of a 1,000 cards that were scanned."
5,Simply Great,"I cannot see how anyone wrote negatives on this devize. It works great. Most cards scan without error or adjustment, Not sure why some people have had problens. It is simple and fast. The only card that failed was a card with dark blew background and gold writing. All other cards were scanned as advertised"
1,Just horrible experience,"Got a brand new device and after scanning about 15 cards, it stopped working. The scanner just failed. Called tech support and they agreed that the device malfunctioned and I should call customer service to get it replaced.This is where the misery really starts. I have held for someone to come on the customer service line for 20 minutes each time but no one comes to the phone. Finally, I left a message and haven't heard back from them yet. Just horrible, I wouldn't buy CardScan products."
2,Love it but it is a dead end,"Its a shame. I really like this scanner and the software that comes with it. Unfortunately the manufacture does not intend to keep the software and drivers current and that is a big problem. For example I bought a new computer with Vista 64. No drivers. I called the customer support people and they told me that they have no intention of providing 64 bit drivers for Vista or for the new Windows 7. Not just that they haven't gotten around to it but that they have no plans to support future operating systems. Hmmm.Also, if you look you will see that they are not keeping current with the latest versions of other software such as ACT 2009 or 2010.It makes me wonder if they eventually plan on dropping these products which would be too bad. The device works really well. It is pretty accurate and I love the drag and drop capabilities of the software."
4,How to scan your business cards,I got this knowing it was an older model because it was only about 15% the price of the new model. It lacks some of the nicer features of the new stuff but does the job. It's a bit erratic in feeding the cards smoothly but no problem if you're not using it constantly for a high volume of cards.
3,Must Read Before You Buy,The product is very good if you have windows XP as it does not work with windows 7 64 bit or 32 bit. if you have windows 7 professional 64 bit then you can work this on windows virtul pc where it runs windos xp. If the product manufacturer is listening they should send the patch to the customers for 64 bit software.
2,Limited Synch choices,"I have enjoyed using my Cardscan products over the years. I upgraded to version 8 because of my upgrade to Windows 7 64 bit. I was surprised that the software doesn't have a good way to synchronize files with Google Contacts, Iphone or Ipad. The contact compatibility software is very limited. Lotus notes? Palm desktop? It's like it's 1999 again.The ONLY way I could get my contacts on the iphone is to synch with Outlook 2003 and then synch Outlook with the iphone. Not exactly a one touch solution."
1,Buyer beware. Does not work with 64 bit systems.,So you're in for a big headache. The scanner doesn't even say that on the outside of the box so you will come home and find you just bought a useless piece of garbage.DO NOT BUY this scanner. Go with other companies/scanners that support their users and do not OMIT CRITICAL INFORMATION from their boxes.Will never buy a single product from Cardscan again. What they do amounts to deception and lying.
1,Doesn't work with 64bit windows /7/Vista,Don't buy this if you intend to upgrade to Win7/Vista 64bit. There's no driver solution or support for 64bit so this product becomes completely useless.
1,As many others have stated...this thing just doesn't work,"The previous version of the CardScan used to work, then stopped. After trying numerous solutions, I figured I would try a new version. When operating properly, the Card Scan is useful albeit not perfect. It speeds up the process of loading cards, although many of the scans do wind up needing corrections.The new one did not work either. When trying to install, it won't make it past the calibration phase. I tried every fix they had on the website to no avail. After reading all the reviews, I wasn't that surprised. The easy returns through Amazon made it worth the shot that it would work, but it did not.If you try it and it works, it's a 3 star product...if it doesn't work, 1 star and back to Amazon. If you give it a shot, make sure you keep your packaging."
3,"Great, unless you have a 64 bit machine","I bought my CardScan Personal prior to upgrading my desktop and then my laptop. As many other reviews have pointed out, this scanner will not work with 64 bit machines, period. This is a hardware and driver issue, so even if you are running Win7 Pro with XP Mode, the device driver will not work. In my case, the net result of all of this is that I now I have an old 32 bit desktop computer that only gets turned on when I need to scan cards.As for the actual scanner, its great. If you have a 32 bit machine (including a newer 32 bit machine running Win 7) you will probably be very happy with your CardScan, it works as advertised. If, however, you are planning to upgrade your computer anytime soon and want to keep scanning cards, I suggest you hang on to your old computer...you'll need it."
5,Incredibly easy to install and sync to Outlook,"I found the scanner & software installation very quick and easy. I use Microsoft Outlook to maintain my contacts for both computer & PDA and I found that by using the scanner I've made my contact information more complete (typically I never entered mailing addresses and titles to save time) and I've dramatically cut the time needed to enter and update contacts. A tool exists to find duplicate contacts it was very effective in eliminating multiple duplicate entries in my contact database. Sometimes the scanner has trouble recognizing company names, as business cards frequently have artistic logos in place of written names, so some manual entry may still be required. It does poorly with cursive writing, as to be expected. But it is pretty sharp at taking in phone numbers without making mistakes, and that is most important for my purposes. The online contact archiving tool seems that it would be useful as well."
4,Very nice product,"After reviewing many items, I selected this one, one week after I pushed trough 162 (non stop) cards and it was great, it is fast, almost intelligent and reliable. !!! I Liked it.. The OCR is not perfect, but no one is, it mixed L for 1 and I for 1 too, there are some other misplaced letters but works fine.English or Spanish horizontal or vertical cards, white or colored, heavily back grounded or not, this is a must in your Home office or big business"
2,Dissappointed,I was very excited about this product but I basically have to correct the bad reads from the scanner. I spend just as much time as if I was putting each name in a database without the use of this scanner. Great idea but poor performance.
1,will not work on 64 bit,"be sure to know that this will not work o no new systems, win 7 ,vista, xp basically anything over a windows 98"
2,Limitations that were not clear,"Thought it would transport along with my laptop to other wifi environments, but it doesn't. So, if I take it along with my laptop to the office, it doesn't work there. It only works on the same laptop at my home. I've called support services (chat) and they were going to ""look into it"", but never got back."
5,I like,Works better than expected. Very convenient. This has saved me a ton of time and allowed me to recycle more paper. Very impressed on how it can read cards and put the data in the right spots........very little editing.
1,Not bad when it works,"It worked fine for a while. Then it quit recognizing cards when they were inserted in the device.Calls to support are maddening. Just forget about it. After waiting 30 minutes with no answer with an irritating voice remind you how to self-fix your problem, I gave up and threw it in the trash!Waste of money and time. DO NOT BUY unless you recognize this is a disposable device. Forget about warranty. If don't answer their phone or their email, I guess they never have to provide it."
1,Need tech support? Good luck,"One of the worst tech products I have ever purchased. Need technical support? Call them first before you purchase. Maybe they'll pick up the phone before your Card Scan shows up, but I doubt it. Hours are something ridiculous like only after 10:30 AM. Product did not scan upon its arrival and tech support is non-existent. I only gave this product 1 star because I had to. If 0 stars was an option, I would have chosen it."
3,Is it needed?,"The Cardscan works ok, but is it really needed? I have an ACT database and the cardscan works ok, you have to scan cards two to three times occasionally because it doesnt scan everything perfect. With so many different business card designs it displays the wrong information in fields so you need to go back in the fields and change the information. It hasn't really been the time saver I thought it would be. I will say the day I received my first Cardscan it didn't work but the customer service at CardScan was A+ and had me another one sent out right away. I work with tons of contacts and I feel you could spend the same amount of time entering the info into a data base yourself and put the card in a box. So save your money and get a database and enter the info yourself."
3,won't work with palm on vista,"This would be lovely, unless you are using the palm desktop on vista. It is not compatible with it. They claim its Palm's problem, palm is not returning calls, and there is no time frame for a fix. If you use outlook I believe you should be fine."
5,Tremendous time saver,"I have been using this device for over three months now. I scanned probably several hundred cards. So far it worked perfectly. Yes, it can not recognize all the information all the time, but the interface is so clever that it is a pleasure to fix the errors and save the information. The scaninng process is very efficient. The fact that it saves card images helps a lot psychologically. Highly recommended to those who are tired of buying business card holders."
5,Great product - makes managing contacts a breeze,"Great value product. Purchased just 3 months ago and have managed to better organize my business and personal contacts. The OCR software could be better and does sometimes fails to get the name or some other detail correctly from the business card. However this is only in very limited cases (non standard cards), but it does mean you have to carry out a quality check.The synchronization with Microsoft Outlook and back up online (atyourservice) is excellent. Allows me to access the full contact data anywhere in the world even without my laptop and blackberry.Overall an excellent product for its price. Definately recommended."
3,"Pretty Good Stuff, but not 100% perfect","The book offers some pretty good advice for anyone trying to 'disappear', but it's not perfect either. For example, when referencing hiding in Norway (where I live), the author points out that few people in Norway speak English. In reality, it's hard to find someone in Norway who DOESN'T speak English!"
2,I guess I was looking for his first book,"This book looked really complete and interesting, but it is actually rather rambling with interesting bits hidden in the midst of semi-relevant anecdotes.I later discovered this is the sequel to another book to which this merely adds detail, perhaps it would be better after I had read that one."
2,Not as pictured.,"Book was in good condition, but was a different cover than pictured. Must be an older volume, but the book i got was published in 90' and the newer book pictured has Hunter's newer stuff in addition to the rest. Guess Ill have two versions of he book once i find the right one."
4,Don't work,I need to return the these fog lights one of them didn't work didn't light up and my day time running light sign came up on the car
1,Disappointing,"This printing was computer scanned and reprinted without Hebrew fonts. As a result, anywhere there should be Hebrew text is simply gibberish. While General Books does offer an electronic copy of the original work, the print copy is completely useless. If you intend to use this book to study Hebrew, it is worthless."
3,Fonts corrected,"Apparently the lack of Hebrew fonts mentioned by the first reviewer has been corrected. My copy has very clear and correct Hebrew letters. Overall, the type is a little light, making it somewhat difficult to read. This is a low cost version of the original, so if you have good eyesight and are trying to save a few bucks, this edition works."
2,Do Not Light Here,"I am always looking for inspiration and alternatives for my birdhouse designs. The first part of this book caught my fancy with great photographs. Sadly the section on design plans was a great disappointment with little or no illustrations or photographs of completed houses. Also, there was no index in my edition. Bummer...wish I had bought it used rather than paying full price."
1,Bird Doo-Doo,How do you put out a book like this with no pictures of the finished projects? Ridiculous! I wish I could give it ZERO stars!
2,DISAPPOINTING,I WAS VERY DISSAPPOINTED WITH THIS BOOK. IN THE SECTION WHERE THEY HAVE THE INSTUCTIONS FOR BIRD HOUSES TO BUILD THEY DON'T HAVE A PICTURE OF IT. EVEN THE DRAWING IS NOT OF THE FINISHED BIRD HOUSE BUT A DRAWING WITH ALL THE PIECES UNATTACHED. I GUESS YOU HAVE TO BUILD THE THING TO SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. BIG HELP!
5,The New Birdhouse Book,"Good designs, easy to follow plans. This book piqued my interest in dovecotes, and now I'm off in another direction."
2,Praying to a Laughing God was a book I would never re-read.,"At the end of the book, it didn't matter anymore who committed the crime - you had finally reached the end of a long, drawn out story about a murder."
5,shredding guitars,"The concert is at Budokan It starts up with Jens Johannsen warming up on Keyboard and Yngwie does not dissapoint at the opening. Jeff Scott Soto is his lead singer from Los Angeles CA and the band started up after Yngwie left Steeler. Opening up with 'I'll see the light Tonight"" You can really hear Anders on Bass and Yngwie does part of the solo with his teeth. He makes the guitar scream like a donkey. Bitchin'. It ends with Black Star and the crowd goes ballistic. At the end he breaks his stratacaster and the 2 asian girls were so suprised to get those pieces. A U.S. Concert would have a fight for those priceless pieces. I've been looking all over to get this concert. A classic."
4,Easy to read overview of organizational limits.,"A good read that, at under 80 pages, quickly gets to the point. Based on a lecture series, this book explores public choice concepts with regards to organizations. This is a good augment to North's books on institutions."
5,"Not a perfect performance, but heartfelt","Buy this CD by all means, and let's encourage a major choir and orchestra to mount the European or OR premiere"
2,Phsically Demanding,"I have read cookbooks that featured physically demanding recipes..... this book is physically demanding just to be read. I can't imagine who thought up the size of this book and was able to foist it on the hapless authors. There are probably some interesting recipes inside, but you have to be a determined cook to strong-arm your way into that book to find them. Almost impossible to read unless you are really willing to work at it....which I am not. I wish I had my money back."
3,nice section on canning,"I've eaten at Home several times, and was touched by the interview on NPR about how they fed folks after Sept 11. But I probably won't use this cookbook that often, despite its charming design and friendly-sounding food. The recipes sound good, but most seem like they're a little too complicated for everyday use--not to mention the fact that they aren't especially healthy. However, I really liked the section on pickling and preserving--and when my garden gets out of hand again next summer, I know I'll put this book to good use."
4,Nice side doors for easy access to your stuff,"This is a great tent, the side wings add nice space and with cargo doors for easy access. The four windows provide excellent ventilation.The tie down strap are a litte lite, one of mine tore the second trip out."
5,A great saw especialy for the price,I bought this saw several months ago and I have been using it quite a bit.This is an excellent saw especially for the very low price.
5,Just beautiful!,"Elmer Bernstein was one of the most talented and prolific composers of film music, and the themes from Desire under the Elms prove it. The love theme is such that it touched my heart, and I never fail to cry when I hear it. His death was such a terrible loss to the genre."
3,Not so good,"I am a big fan of the late Elmer Bernstein and Desire Under The Elms is no exception. However, this CD is a disappointment, sound-wise. Maybe it is a poorly pirated version but the sound is just tinny. This isn't Dolby of course, but I wouldn't call it stereo or even hi-fi. The music is lovely but this CD just doesn't do justice to what is a lovely and lively score."
1,Defictive Brake Drum,"This unit was as bad as the original I was replacing.I had to purchase a new one from local Auto Store,which I should of done in the first place. I guess I learned from making a bad choice."
3,"Great story, poor art","Because of his intelligent scripts and his sympathetic rendition of the main characters, I'm sure that Mark Waid's run on the Fantastic Four will be remembered as one of the title's high points.In Authoritative action, we see comicdom's first family deal with a political crisis that they unwittingly caused. Waid's tale echoes today's headlines, but despite the grim overtones of the story he manages to make the reader smile. I particularly liked Reed Richard's comment about their (recently dead) arch-Nemesis, Dr. Doom: ""We delude ourselves? He'll be back. He always comes back"". It shows that good Dr. Richards knows his comics.I can't give the book five stars (which the writing would amply deserve) because of the dismally amateurish artwork. Despite his obvious enthusiasm, I found that the penciller's shortcomings in basic drawing skills (anatomy, perspective, placement of images) was very distracting.I do recommend the book, though, solely for the script."
5,The Orleans CD to buy!!!,"If you're a fan of great harmonies, great guitar solo's, upbeat lyrics, great ballads and driving rock n' roll, then you'll love this CD. of the truly great live bands in history (that no one knows, but people know their songs), including radio favorites like ""Dance with Me"" and ""Still The One"" sounding better than their studio versions, which were excellent. Joanna Hall, band leader John Hall's wife, writes a compelling story about the band's journey in the CD jacket. If you like the Doobies, Firefall, Kansas, Sanford Townsend Band, you'll love Orleans!"
1,Very bad customer support,It is only 3 or 4 months that we got the speaker for our Zune 2... when i doc the zune it is getting charged and synchrinizing with the computer but the audio output is not there. If i connect thro the audio cable i hear the song... Something wrong with the doc on the base...I cant write enough about the customer support... they want me to send the whole doc to their corporate office at my own expense for fixing it.Will not try this or any product from Altec lansing any more.If you are ok with trying your luck... go for it.thanks
4,Great speaker system for Zune or any MP3 player!,"The sound is great, in fact, better than I thought it would be. I admit that I did trust in the Altec Lansing name. Only one thing that I thought was strange. When I power down the unit, the Zune stays on. It cannot be powered down while in the cradle. Maybe because it is charging? I am very satisfied with it so far, besides, Amazon had the lowest price anywhere! I also use other MP3 players and CD players on it. The remote comes in handy."
4,"Good SOund, Controls Lacking","This audio system has good quality sound and puts out some pretty decent volume. But the remote buttons do not duplicate those of the Zune ... you just get play, pause, volume, and next/previous tracks. The Back Button and Directional controller are not duplicated on the remote, so to use those to maneuver through the Zune menus, you still have to use the Zune's controls. This unit is on my desk at work, so reaching the Zune is not a big problem. But if you're planning on using the system from a distance, you might be disappointed to not have full maneuverability from the remote."
5,Love it!,I just ordered the Altec Lansing Audio System for my Zune and I absolutely love it! It sounds great and charges while docked. The size is compact and doesn't take up much space on my desk. The remote control is an added plus.
4,Very good sound system,"The Altec Lansing M604 is an excellent addition to the Zune family of products. The only problem is the finicky way the system must be initially connected. After goofing with the initial setup for more than 15 minutes, trying to turn it on the audio system worked like a charm. The speakers are good for the cost. The high and low range are adequate.I would recommend it, but please be aware of the sequence of how to turn on the unit."
2,Virtually dead,"After a couple of years of touchy (but acceptable) operation, this thing is virtually useless because of the incessant popping. Understand that this is a common problem. Why aren't there more choices for this type of product? Won't buy any more Altec Lansing products, fool me once..."
4,Good value,"A good portable speaker system for Zune. Bass response gets a little fuzzy at maximum volume levels, but over all has good sound quality for the price. Would recommend it for everyday use."
1,"My Friends, you're buying an older product at a horrific price","I bought one of these for about $50 2 years or so ago to go with my zune 30gb. Not a bad setup for $50. I think they were originally around $100. In fact if you still look around, you can still find them for $50 + shipping (and more often between $50-$100).Also note that most of the reviews for this item are old and made before this third party seller started selling them for an outrageous $330!So, while these are nice zune speakers, they were discontinued a couple years ago (so who knows if altec will give warranty support). Also, at the current price of $330, you're getting ripped off. In fact the getting ripped off part is so bad: it's as if after running you over, they back up to run you over again!I also don't know if they work with all the newer zunes. These were discontinued when there was only the 30gb zune."
1,BE CARFULL OF TOTTENHAMHS796!,"BEWARE OF THIS SELLER OR YOU WILL BE RIPPED TOO!Erin Fulton erincap43@yahoo.com hiding behind ""tottenhamhs796"" offers products at DOUBLE of their market price and ships USED, bent, scratched product with black marks all around it.Look at the number of complaints and the pathetic seller responses to understand I am not the first one they ripped; furthermore, they have the guts to CONDITION REFUND upon REMOVAL OF MY NEGATIVE FEEDBACK."
2,Don't BUY AT THIS PRICE!!!!,I purchased this early this year and I know it was about $100 -- this price is ridiculous! Not worth this price but decent for $50-$100...
1,Ripped Off,I bought the M604 for my son for xmas and 3 weeks later it wouldn't work. I called Altec and Amazon and they said I have to send it back to Altec @ my own expense. It will cost you alot more than your initial price if you have a problem with yours. I will write another review when I send mine back and report what kind of service Altec Lansing provided me when all is said and done.
3,Good & Bad,Love the MP3 sound from the Zune but it wont play the radio unless you keep your hand touching it. Very disapointed with that part.
2,great product,the product came as it was advertised and really works great sound excellent hard to believe this small of a package can deliver this much sound.
5,Early Christmas Gift,"I purchased the speakers on Woot about a month ago for $40 and have not been disappointed yet. They are very easy to use and pump out great sound. They are also very easy to move around. I've taken them all around the house and never had a problem. I wish I would have gotten another one to keep in another part of the house. Also, I haven't had a problem with the remote at all."
5,Quality room filling music without breaking the bank,"Attached a Zune played to this speaker and was impresed- to say the least - by the sound quality of this speaker. Stereo sound separation is excellent as is tonal quality; room filling, undistorted misic is the norm with this speaker. As a bonus, this speaker can be attached to othercomponents( even a T/V )with the included cables to enhance one's listening/viewing experence. The unit's uses are only limited by the user's imagation."
3,Not for all ZUNE's,"I own a Zune 80MB that appears not to be compatable with this product. The plug (dock) in front does not fit the Zune 80. I can plug into the AUX input as other MP3 players. I just loose the charging feature when docked. Speakers sound fine, not great but okay. Considering the cost this is an okay product."
5,Worth the money,"I Love this item. A few days after I recieved it I was rockin' out to my tunes and my neighbor came over and told me my stereo was too loud!! HAHA I was actually shocked. The sound is great. Just wish there was a better product, like this, for my car."
3,Working The Wheel,"You may be forgiven for thinking that this book is more about Martin and F1 then it is anything else. Well you'd be wrong. This is for the serious F1 fans only and being one for 27 years I still found plenty of excuses to put it down. It's not that I don't like Martin Brundle, because I do, that's the point! I thought this was all about him and his racing career instead it's a step by step account of 18 race tracks around the world. Only a certain amount of how a chicane bends and how rough the asphalt is can be found interesting.Hopefully Martin will bring out a biography at some point because lets face it: with 12 years F1 driving and nearly 10 behind the microphone the man has plenty of stories to tell."
2,Well told but the wrong story,"I disliked it, even though it is patently written to amuse the general reader, because it stresses the issues that I don't care about. Just like it was a biography of a modern celebrity, the author goes on about the private life, loves, cares, deeds of this man.On the background are these things that were going on in the world and that happened to cross the paths of our ""heroe"". These other issues are dismissed almost as a bother. And I should think it was the other way round. If Constantine's life matters today is because of the times he lived in, the spread of Christianity into Europe and European history in general.A completely flawed book because it takes the leaves for the carrot. Even worse: being a highly reader-friendly book, it becomes a rather obscene exercise of history, an object of riducule for achieving the hardest thing but missing the target totally. Well-told; only the wrong story. The title is absurd and misleading."
2,Great Rough Draft,"This is a fascinating story of a historical figure about whom few people know anything. Tragically the book is so poorly edited and proofread, it proves to be a frustrating read. Seriously, I've never seen a published work so full of spelling, grammar, and stylistic errors. These mechanical issues gave me pause to wonder how well the factual material was researched. It is shocking to see how the publisher dropped the ball on this release. Sadly, the author is not a native English speaker and possibly was not immediately aware of his editor's lack of professional attention."
3,The First Christian Emperor,"Excellent book with impeccable resources. What it lacks in literary flair it makes up in detail, and sympathy to its subject. The author's first language is not English and it shows, but his scholarship is splendid and his passion unmistakable. I wonder why publishers go to press with slipshod editing and faulty supervision of style. Not everyone can research Constantine or the later days of Imperial pagan Rome but anyone versed in style and syntaxis can make the necessary corrections in order to enrich this fine material."
5,Fel-Pro 23591 Gasket,"Goes between flanges on Walker 15538 catalytic converter pipe and Walker 45725 ""intermediate pipe"" on my '93 (gen 3) Camry 2.2L. Fits like it was made for it. Oh, right - it is made for it !"
4,Pink Glove,"I don't play baseball/softball religiously, but this glove was awesome! I got it in the mail soon after I ordered it and it was very broken in and well-made. The only complaint is that the knots aren't extremely tight, but the glove itself is great!"
5,The student becomes the master,"The Highlander Movie series has had many followers. However, for style and sensitivity, the TV series by far surpasses the its origins. Those who have seen the series and continue to watch the series on cable will agree that this series offers depth on many levels. My personal interests are the detailed costuming in the flashback sequences and the character development."
1,It does not work,I got this product but it does not work totally. I was so disappointed. I hope there should be better item for me and other persons
5,"A ""must"" for military aviation buffs","In Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15: The Soviet Union's Long-Lived Korean War Fighter, Yefim Gordon provides the military aviation enthusiast with a comprehensive, profusely illustrated, descriptive history of a formidable fighting aircraft that was, in its time, a staple of the Soviet airforce. Schematics, historical photos, and a wealth of detailed aeronautical and design information is provided for all of the various versions and varieties of this combat aircraft. Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 is a welcome and informative addition to any professional, and academic aviation history collection, and a ""must"" for military aviation buffs."
4,Toast with Jam,"Have only started to use it but so far... I have had problems and will now have to consult their manual to see if its fixable... Operating the program intuitively and from experience from past versions, I was disappointed to see the first CD I burned which should have contained about 18 songs did NOT record several tracks.. could be my fault but I didn't do anything differently to the tracks which did record as opposed to the tracks that didn't record but did take up space on the burned CD.. back to the drawing board.."
2,Glance at a glance,"This book provides an ""Glance at a Glance""The book is fast read and gives a good introduction to cartography.Note that the book's examples are rather focused on English maps, this focus can lead to the fact that examples are most relevant to readers living in or with knowledge of the UK. If the examples had been based on the same site/location, this could have contributed to a more general (global?) angle on the subject where the focus had been the introduction to cartography.The book is easily read and gives a good overview of the topic, and can be recommended as a book for beginners, the book is a good introduction, where you can find inspiration to further reading in the subject field."
5,QUALITY,"I bought this CD, because Shane and Shane led worship at a week long youth retreat. There Worship was so awesome so I decided to buy one of their CD's. The music on this CD is very good and I would recommend it if you like Quality music."
4,Soothing Acoustic Sound,"This cd has been in my cd player for the last few weeks .. and it definitely helps to usher me into the presence of God with profound lyrics that speak to the heart. The song ""I Miss You"" reminds one that this life is only temporary ... and is nothing compared to the eternal life we have in Jesus Christ. Other songs such as ""May the Few"" praise the Lord for His mighty ways in all the earth. If you like Shane and Shane's style - fresh harmonies intertwined with insightful lyrics and sweet acoustic guitar ... buy this album.Heartfelt and inspiring, ""Upstairs"" stirs up homesickness in the heart of this Christian."
5,I delight myself in the Richest of Fare,"This is my favorite Shane and Shane CD (however, they are all great!). I love the story on the inside of the CD of how everything was going wrong when recording and how they almost scrapped it. I'm so glad they pushed through because this is a strong CD. The Shanes have a gift of blending flawless harmonies into folksy songs that make you want to close your eyes and breathe it all in. The Shanes excel in simple yet poignant lyrics that Shane Barnard delivers in a breathy angelic kind of way. Highlights include Psalm 13, Holy, Beauty For Ashes, The Answer, I Want It All, and Yearn. And all of the rest of the songs are also good. I love a CD that can say so much without having to say a lot. Shane and Shane can only get better, too, so I look forward to their CD!"
4,True nostalgia,"This is real nostalgia when, even if you weren't home, a real, live person answered the telephone. Judy Holliday is at her comedic best as an employee of an answering service that just can't discipline herself to ""just take and give messages"", as her employer asks, and the chaos it creates is non-stop hilarity. Dean Martin is well cast as straight man to her antics and leading man who isn't sure who the girl is he's trying to get. If you like to laugh, this one's for you."
5,You will not regret this purchase!,I hadn't wathced this movie in years but remembered liking it. Bought it and WOW! Love it so much more then I even remembered. It's a comedy and it's a musical to boot!
4,A rare delight,"Bells Are Ringing is one of the rarest of all MGM musicals these days, but it's not at all bad despite a strong air of theatricality, most notably in the awkwardly staged finale. It's easy to see the strong influence this must have had on Amelie as Judy Holliday's Susanswerphone operator meddles in the lives of her clients, transforming them all for the better. The police investigation and bookie subplots don't really work that well (and the song-writing dentist is surely far more irritating than he was ever intended to be), but Holliday tones down the ditziness for something more believable and genuinely likeable and Frank Gorshin's hilariously brilliant impersonation of Marlon Brando is worth the price of the DVD alone. Dean Martin seems strangely sidelined here, especially with Holliday getting all the best songs, but it's still delightful entertainment if a tad overlong.A good widescreen transfer and deleted musical numbers round out a very decent package."
5,You'll Love This Musical,"Judy Holliday steals the show. In her role as Ella Peterson, a vunerable employee of ""Suesanswerphone"", (a telephone answering service in the days before answering machines) she reaches out to help three of her many subscribers with hilarious results. The triad include a dentist that wishes he were a composer, a beatnik actor that no one will hire, and a down-on-his-luck playright. All three of these characters have something in common, as the movie reveals. The music by Jule Styne is memorable and includes the hits ""The Party's Over"" and ""Just In Time"". Although not noted for her singing, Judy's renditions perfectly suit her wonderful acting. Her songs range from funny to dramatic, and are lovingly done. I can't think of anyone I would have rather had in her role. Dean Martin, as Jeff Moss, is a fine counterpart to Judy. I would love to see this musical released on DVD...is anybody listening??? Highly Recommended.UPDATE: Available now on DVD!!!! It's GREAT!!!"
3,Gifted,"Bought this as a gift for my parents. I'm told it's quite good, but I haven't seen it. They are trustworthy though, so you can probably count on it being good."
5,Bells are Ringing,One of my favorite Dean Martin movies and who wouldn't love Judy Holliday. A must watch for anyone that likes Dean Martin or Judy Holliday.
3,THE SOUND OF ONE WAVE CLAPPING,"Following on the heels of THE MATRIX by the same author, we find our hero's on holiday and in danger again. Ultimate weapons, a waterlogged world,intelligent dolphins and underground cities mixed with a juggernaut of a hurricane bearing down on them all... this is one busy book, and when creatures are not attacking the city, and Ace is not on the run, and the Doctor isn't hatching one escape after the next... it does take time to build on the relationship between the Doctor and Ace. Few Doctor Who books do this, and when they do I like to point them out. The Doctor and Ace share both an intelligent and adult relationship here, and it's in these moments that the book shines through the standard (and overly used) plot. For fans of the series, not for first time buyers..."
5,"Krill Kream, a little dab'll do ya!!!","The team of Mike Tucker and Robert Perry have fused together to bring us another fantastic 7th Doctor novel. Looking for a holiday from their previous adventure, the Doctor and Ace arrive on the colony planet Corralee. Their peace is soon shattered as a series of vicious attacks on underwater divers and ships occur which leads to an almost unstoppable attack onto the colony itself. Very well written, you can feel undertones of the JAWS and ALIENS movies throughout, plus there is more of a connection between the Doctor and Ace occuring. This is another story that would have been excellent on screen. RECOMMENDED to everyone."
1,Not impressed.,"I wasn't impressed by this toaster in any way. Although the slots are wide they are not long and I needed to cut the ends off my rye bread to get it into the slots. Nevertheless, I still expected a nicely toasted piece of bread.Under the shiny stainless steel lies a rather mundane mechanism for toasting. The knobs came preset to ""5"" and since my wife likes her toast pale and I like mine quite dark, I set her side to ""4"" and mine to ""6."" Her toast came out basically raw while mine was almost burnt (at least on the left side--the right side was okay). What the other numbers do, I have no idea! But here's the strange thing: both of our slices were fairly cold right out of the toaster. They didn't even melt the room-temperature butter!Although I didn't try the bagel toasting gadget or the warmer function, even if they worked flawlessly I would have to say this toaster is substandard. I intend to return it next week."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I had high expectations of this toaster after the glowing reviews!Maybe I have a defective one. One side toasts true to the setting, ie, burns toast at setting 9. The other side barely changes the color on setting 9 and in fact half of the toast remains completely white (untoasted) and cold in both compartments which tells me there must be something wrong with it. I've only had it 3 days and am incredibly disappointed. Also, I have to echo what some other customers have said. It takes so frigging long to toast anything!!!! I mean, I don't have time in the morning to stand around waiting for my toast! I now tend to put the toast in my toaster, go do something else and then come back for it. My perfectly half done, cold toast is waiting for me on my return."
1,An attractive toaster,"We needed a toaster that matched the rest of our kitchen, to replace one that didn't. This one fit the bill. It works quite well, handling a variety of sizes of slices."
1,Even toasting but slower than molasses.,This toaster does toast very evenly but it takes it's sweet time doing it. Mine takes between 4 1/2 to 5 full minutes to get bread a medium golden brown. The toast is very dry after all that time. You can cook and eat a scrambled egg before your toast is ready. Skip this and buy a faster toaster that can do the job in half the time.
1,Not much Aid in the Kitchen for this KitchenAid Toaster,Had this toaster for six months. The knob broke and the right side no longer works. KitchenAid is no help so don't even bother with a call. To bad they don't stand behind their products.
2,"Piece o' ""You know what""","Bought this thing in December, 2007. Never toasted very fast; and each round of toast gets darker -even on the same setting.Now after three years, it is taking up to 10 minutes to lightly toast a slice of rye bread.The only PRO of this item is that it looks nice sitting on the counter.Will never buy again."
3,"Okay, but not worth the price","Problems: Purchased 9/3/2010. By 11/15/2010 the right side often will not stick down. The plastic knobs are cheap. The right side broke off on Thanksgiving day leaving just the metal post sticking out. The left side plastic knob seems to be cracking.Kitchen Aid has a 1 yr warranty and will replace for free.Advantages: This has the bagel option, but most toasters have that now. It does look nice and the crumb tray is larger and covers the entire bottom and therefore it is easier to get all the crumbs out. It also looks nicer on the counter...ie more expensive.All in all it isn't any better than the $40 toaster I had before this one TFAL, I believe, which lasted 10 years. Some of the parts are cheaply made such as the plastic knobs.Thus, for $45 it is a fine toaster, assuming the knobs don't break. At $89 it isn't worth the price and I'd buy a different one next time."
1,slowest toaster ever,"Takes too long to toast, oversized, one of the plastic handles broke so now it looks like a piece of junk. Regret paying the premium price."
4,Great Toaster,"I bought this toaster as a Christmas present for my wife who is always complaining that our toaster didn't toast evenly, burning one side and hardly toasting the other. She toasts english muffins, waffles and bread daily for our kids. So far after about 3 weeks of use, this toaster has made my wife happy, which is almost like getting a Christmas present for myself. ;-)One last thing. It is a space hog. If that is a concern, get your tape measure out before you buy one. It is BIG.Just an update on 10/25/10 after 10 months of regular daily use: This toaster is still going strong and it is still toasting very evenly and my wife loves it...."
4,"Huge, but great at toasting","We like the results of the toasting from this unit, but it is huge! Get ready to give up some serious counter space when you drop this bad boy in there!"
4,Classy toaster,"I've only had it for a few weeks, but I'm satisfied so far. It certainly looks great. It is a little large, but it fit my counter after I moved some things around.I like my bagels toasted on both sides, so the ""bagel"" setting isn't useful for me. I tried the ""warm"" setting to heat already-toasted bread, and it worked fine. However, it doesn't quite replace fresh-toasted bread for butter-melting purposes.The toasting settings are reasonable: I use 3 for rye bread; 5 for potato (moist) bread; 5 or 6 for bagels and fresh English muffins. I've never used a setting over 6 (goes up to 10, I think). The speed of toasting is acceptable, but it would be faster if the toasting elements reached ""glowing"" temperature faster--they are sluggish, but maybe they'll last longer. Things toast reasonably evenly."
5,Great product,I love the clean lines and general over all look of this toaster. It toasts well on everything from bagels to thin sliced toast. Great product!
2,Does not toast evenly; bread doesn't fit,"We tried using this toaster and found it toasted unevenly --- some parts of the bread came out burnt, others lightly toasted. (Probably some filaments were not working, but I was not interested in trying to diagnose the problem).A second problem is that large bread, like rye or pumpernickel won't fit. The bread is too wide (about 6"" across, and the slots only let bread about 4 1/2"" in)."
2,Toaster for Bagels,"Our toaster oven which we had for years finally quit. So we thought we would try a toaster that wouldtoast not only slices of bread but also Bagels, which we like a lot. We bought the Kitchen Aid brandbecause we have a coffee maker of that brand which we like very much. It definatly not a chep toaster,which is O.K. and it is advertised as a toaster that cnn toast Bagels. Well if you try to get the cutside of the Bagel somewhat brown, then the back side comes out black or I should say burnt. What wehave to do is put the Bagel in at a lower setting, wait for it to pop up, take them out and turn them180 degrees to toast the other half. I think it's a terrible design. Not very happy with this productat all. We purchased the Stainless Steel one which is nice looking, too bad it's such a lousy toaster."
3,Okay but not perfect,"This toaster is what you would want a toaster to be: simple, down-to-earth, and efficient. My big problem is that the push down tab split and broke within a year of its use. It's not as though we dropped it or misused it. It just split because it wasn't made well. It seems like a small item, but it's the only thing one touches when one does a toast. But if you have more than one person in the house that eats breakfast at the same time, the four-slot version is the best way to go."
3,toaster,This toaster seemed well made. The slots were too short for the bakery bread we buy so we returned and got a long slot toaster.
5,Best Toaster Ever,"LOVE my new toaster. Love the look, love the controls and love the way it toasts evenly. The bagel setting is great too - crispy on one side, light on the other. And hectic mornings are little easier - no more waiting for my turn to toast! Would recommend buying."
5,Great toaster - cheaper at Costco,"I love this toaster, have been wanting it for a long time finally bought it and got it two weeks ago, was at Costco yesterday - you can get the colored ones there for 49.99. DARN"
2,not worth the extra cash,"I have been researching 4 slice toasters and found the reviews to give this the tops! Well I am dissatisfied. It takes 4-6 minutes to toast, does so unevenly. Top brown bottom uncooked. Sometimes I set it on 9 and have to punch it down a second time to get browning. for soo much money, I would have hoped for a better product."
3,Good looking but doesn't brown thicker bread,"I like everything about this toaster, however, even on the highest setting it doesn't harden my english muffin. You would think that it would burn it on the 9 setting but it's still soft and not brown at all. For normal size pieces of bread it toasts much better. I accidentaly left the setting high from when I put the muffin in and the bread burnt. I have yet to try a bagel. Also, the slats are not long enough for wider than normal slices of bread, so artisan bread you buy will have to be crammed in."
4,Retro-appearance lets this toaster blend in with like appliances,"I purchased this because we replaced our stove, refrigerator, and dishwasher in December. I wanted a toaster to match. This looks very nice with all the other new appliances, and I like the bagel button. It's a very handy feature.The one drawback is that the trays pull out from the back; this means I have to turn the toaster all the way around to empty the trays. It would have been much more convenient if the trays could be pulled out from the front."
2,Dry toast that takes forever,"We have had this toaster for over a year now. This toaster takes way too long. I put the bread in before my egg hits the pan and the egg is done before the toast! The bread is evenly toasted but very dry. I hate to throw it out and waste money, but the whole family complains about it. Don't waste your money on this one."
3,Broke after 5yrs,Worked well for about 5 yrs. I expected it to last a lot longer.Will not be buying this model again.
1,"Started out strong, broke after eighteen months","This toaster worked well for the first eighteen months, and then it had the same problems others have reported. The right side no longer works at all. The left knob broke off entirely. When I called KitchenAid, they let me know that because the one-year warranty had expired, my only option was to purchase a new toaster. Since I only use the toaster once or twice a week and it broke after fewer than 100 uses, I estimate that I was paying about $1 per use. Given the quality of this product and that the manufacturer didn't offer any accommodations for a known quality issue, my next toaster won't be a KitchenAid."
4,Very well made,"This stainless steel toaster is stainless inside and has stainless crumb trays. It makes great toast and does bagels really well. The only thing making it four star instead of five star is that toast and bagels aren't the same color from top to bottom - not enough to affect flavor, just visual. Overall, a wonderful improvement over my old toaster. It's pretty big and takes up a fair amount of counter space. P.S. If you spray a bit of WD-40 on a napkin and wipe down the exterior of the toaster, fingerprints won't show."
5,Kitchen Aid toaster,Best toaster I've had in a long time. Browns evenly and quickly. Another great Kitchen Aid product.
5,Excellent Book,"A great book for everyone to read. We might think we are immune from bitterness, but this sin invades all of us more than we realize. This book helps us to repent of such sin. There are also helpful chapters other relationships."
1,Not at all like Leisure Larry and not much fun as a game either!,"I bought this game thinking that even if it wasn't like Leisure Suit Larry it would be a fun game - it wasn't. It's basically a playboy magazine with some comedy and lots of mini-games involved, if you wanted too you could skip all of the mini-games by finding tokens and just watch the cut scenes although you would miss part of the little storylines in the mini-games - I guess that's why there is complete and entire scripts of the games cut-scenes and minigames online for free.Don't spend your money unless you really, really, really, really like mini-games."
3,Narrower than expected - 5E seems more like 3E,"I currently have a pair of 4E shoes (another brand) that I need to replace from wear, and I had hoped to get 5E ones because I have issues with my feet swelling at work. While these shoes seem nice and appear almost identical to my existing shoes, they are NARROWER! I could barely get my feet in, and that's when they're not terribly swollen. It's not just the upper needing broken in, the soles of the shoes are visibly narrower than my 4E ones when held up against each other. I was so disappointed at having to return them. It's hard to find 4E, let alone 5E shoes, so my search is back on."
4,Need the size,"Nice looking. Does wear out on the tread within a year. Oh well, I need 11 1/2 5E so not much choice.."
1,Wrong shoe sent!,"I must order two pair of velcro shoes to get a pair for my husband, he wears a brace. One of the pairs sent had laces, so had to return both pairs. Inconvenient as a caregiver, yes."
1,The lasted 3 weeks before they started to fail,"I loved these shoes when I first got them, but they started falling apart almost as soon as I started wearing them.The seam on the side split in three weeks, and a week later it started to split at the toe. When I replaced them the soles were already starting to wear through the rubber coating on the bottom.Absolutely the worst pair I ever bought. A $10 pair a sneakers lasted longer."
4,DPW,I have had these shoes for a few days so this may be too early to say what I really think about these shoes. My first impression is that they are only an O.K. fit.( my Starter brand shoes from wall-mart are more comfortable they have more padding) I hope these Propet shoes will last longer than my Starters. I will update this review when I have broken the shoes in fully.
4,Shoes for Dad,"Propet Men's Leisure Walker Velcro SneakerI bought these shoes for my 92-year-old father. He's still very active, but isn't much for shopping, so we decided to help him make his first on-line purchase. He finds the shoes to be very comfortable and the velcro feature to be interesting and practical. They are also good looking, appropriate for any casual activity."
5,"Comfort, Stability, Easy-On and Easy-Off = GREAT!","The Propet men's M3715 Leisure Walker is one of the most comfortable, stable, and easiest to slip on and off shoes I have ever owned or tried. They are a pleasure to wear, even in 100+ degree weather, and for lengthy periods of time, which is an extremely rare achievement. They are light in weight as well as soft enough inside to leave no achy pressure points or chafed areas... a sign of good research and design. The sole and heel patterns seem to provide a very soft cushioned step when walking, as well as a sure-footed grip on all surfaces encountered so far... another sign of a company that took time and effort to plan things right.If comfort with stability and decent style are what you seek, give these your attention. I think you, like me, will be absolutely delighted!___Fritxgibb________2010-07-27___"
5,happy surprise,"pleasantly surprised with item as well as suervice,free shipping was a definite factor on service."
3,Colonialism Redux,"This film is not a documentary, but one German filmmaker's visual montage of ""those strange, exotic beings"" that inhabit Africa (actually just one small corner of Africa, the country of Cameroon). Schmerberg, as director, places his ""subjects"" on display (turning 'round on a lazy susan), throws candy at the children to animate them, directs the men to look fierce as they slowly pull their blades from their sheaths, etc., etc. ""Hommage a Noir"" is in some respects visually stunning, and the music is interesting in its own right (though *utterly* disconnected to its subject). But it is also offensive in it's stereotypical rendering of a foreign place and its inhabitants. Do not get this film if you expect anything close to documentary. And be prepared for a film that is as much indignity as it is homage."
4,Moved,"I really like the music of Ralf Hildenbeutel in general and this DVD is a perfect marriage of music+image.An emotional,moving experience!"
1,Africans as Extras,"Schmerberg is an artist, he probably could make a great Sting or Peter Gabriel or U2 video all musicians who put on a global front, but from his short serious statement of intent, his wish to change European textbooks and let people know Africa, the film was shot in Camaroon, but I guess he means the entire continent, is a wonderful place, places the creator as socialist, historian, and anthropologist. Even if during his comments he would have said ""I just wanted to make a black and white film combing Africans and techno music, his methods are still suspicious. What if he would have turned his lens on San Bernadino or the Tenderloin or even just the people of his own country. He could have used the same music, but would he have used the lazy susan or thrown candy at them? This film is really too easy of a target. I presented a paper on Hommage A Noir in California recently and people laughed at it."
1,did not work for me,"I faithfully took these pills and unfortunately they did not work for me. Sad, because I had high expectations for them with all the reviews I read."
1,Does not work- save your money,"This stuff really doesn't work. I used it for several months with no results. Finally, a fertility doctor told me to stop wasting my money- I did and finally have a little girl coming soon. :)"
2,Mediocre,There really isn't anything extra special in this blend. I used it for 6 months with no luck. This would most likely work best in combination with perscribed clomid or other fertility drugs.
4,Riveting and inspiring,"Dee Hakala's memoire of her struggle with weight and dieting was very well-written and completely inspiring to me. Despite our differences (e.g. I am about 15 pounds overweight), I identified with her as a woman stuck in a culture which values women most for what they look like, and especially how much they weigh. Her story was riveting and so much more interesting than what you find in typical diet and exercise books. Her no-nonsense advice is right on target. She is a living, breathing example of assertiveness and taking life by the tail. I will read this again!"
2,"Disappointing, overly simplified, yet inspirational book","I was disappointed with this book. I applaud Dee Hakala's personal struggle and transformation. I am thrilled with the basic premise of this book (i.e. that everyone, whatever size shape or fatness level CAN and SHOULD enjoy moving his/her body). However, as a fat and fit adult who is fairly knowledgable about nutrition and health, I felt that this bood was treating me as a fat, stupid, ignorant child. This is precisely what rational adults who have abandoned the absurd and harmful dieting jail do not need! Try Marilyn Wann's Fat?So! instead! It's smart, funny, and just as inspiring."
5,"patterns, scales and modes for jazz guitar","this is an excellent introduction to scale modes and their application. like all of mr. berle's instructional books, it is written in an understandable fashion and gets its various points across without a lot of esoterica. this material is aimed at the intermediate guitarist who wants to understand a little of the basic tools for jazz guitar improvisation."
4,heartbreaker,this is an awesome song! if you like pop music this is a must have! mariah has an awesome voice and this song has great lyrics about how awful some guys can b
2,"Decent voice, great range, no originality","I think there is too much mariah bashing going on, but there is also a lot of blind fanaticism. The song is catchy, of course, because it is a pop song. Jay-z helps make it r&b. The remix with missy and da brat are, in my opinion, better than the pop version. Her upper register is impressive, but in this song it seems very unnecessary, like it was just thrown in to annoy her critics. I guess the high pitch gets on some people's nerves, while others prefer it. It sounds better in bliss, a song on her rainbow album. And, yes, it is rehashed from previous hits (Fantasy, Dreamlover). It actually sounds more similar Dreamlover. Sing the two chorus of heartbreaker and dreamlover and you'll be amazed. No, it is not at all original. But she has an audience and a market for it. And people will continue to buy her albums."
5,Mariah is back and better than ever!!,"There should be no doubt by now of who Mariah is musically speaking. She does her own work: producing, writing, directing but the best of all is that the girl can really sing. I love this single because the song gives me a happy and funky feeling I can't describe and the remixes are so great (her rendition of ""if you should ever be lonely"" is awesome.) I expect this single to skyrocket to the classic Mariah position: #1!!!!!!"
2,Sell-out!,"Obviously Mariah has given up her loyalty to superior remixer David Morales to lend it to the monotonous Junior Vasquez. She used to be respected in the dance community for putting out quality, classic mixes. Yeah, the sales will be great, and the clubs will play it because Junior's ""sound"" is in. But what of integrity, longevity and quality?"
2,Try again!,"I think this song sounds like Fantasy a bit too much. She is a very talented singer...if only she would get some new beats to her songs instead of re-mixing her own stuff. I never really liked ""her"" but liked her music. I will never buy aother Mariah cd if the beats are going to stay generic along with those implants she got!"
1,Here we go again,"Just when I thought Mariah would finally give the world a much-needed break from the uncreative, dime-store noise that she passes off as music, she releases yet another single that sounds like a remix of every other song she has recorded to date. To her fans: Don't you people ever get tired of hearing the same song remixed over and over again? How many incarnations of the same song will Mariah have to make before you finally declare ""enough is enough""? I've been hearing her stuff played on the radio since 1990, and I can honestly say that after nearly a decade in the business, this woman has not grown one iota as an artist. Oh well, as long as she keeps making the millions she is--and people keep accepting this kind of music--I guess she has no inspiration for growth."
5,Mariah carey has one of the greatest voices in music today !,Mariah Carey has done it agin with rainbow I just can't say enough about her she has a beautiful voice she's just awesome i mean increatably awesome. goMariah your the best #1 !
1,HEARTBREAKER IS REALLY A FANTASY COME TRUE.,"Yes ""Heartbreaker"" is the same song as ""Fantasy""....case closed.Mariah do you have any originality left?...Copying and sampling from your old music....How low can you go."
3,cliche mariah song but I like it,"Mariah has made the same song over and over and over and over (dreamlover, honey, heartbreaker) but they're usually good and this is no exceptionthe remixes are usually pretty cool w/ the rappers on there is another non-exception"
5,Mariah Carey's Heartbreaker has great remixes to it.,"I think that Mariah Carey's latest single ""Heartbreaker"" is one of her best singles yet. The remixes are excellent on it and she sings great in all of them. The single is surely to goto #1."
2,Rainbow is a weak album,"i downloaded the new album by mariah carey (yes it's already out there)and i must say its the weakest album she has ever made. Her best is behind her. The strongest tracks are heartbreaker and petals. Heartbreaker, because it has the srtongest groove and most memorable chorus on the album (and that doesnt say much) and Petals, for it's upfront honesty, and gentle fragility. Other than those strongpoints, the rest of the albums lyrics, production, and melodies are increbily tired and lagging. It seems mariah thinks this is her best work ever, unfortuneatly for her fans, and even thiose that wish she would gain some artistry and try new directions, there is barely a single moment on this album that you will enjoy."
1,I don't understand the appeal,"I tried to like it, but all the songs sound the same to me. I'm dissapointed."
2,Not a bad single.,I like the remixes from Junior Vasque. Especially the club mix version. The second track with the rap artists is not bad either. But the single's front and back cover looks a little slutty.
2,Could have Been Great !!!,This book certainly had a lot of potential. Unfortunatly there are too many errors. Some very obvious --- Samuel Cooper was not REL's brother in law. He was REL's brother's brother in law by marriage. And the photographs are not always correctly captioned. The dust jacket sleeve mentions over 70 some photos. But Lee was only photographed around 40 times. Some photos he counts twice when in reality they are of a same pose. And some photos could have been larger so the reader could actually see the beauty of the photograph. And some photos that have been discovered many years ago were simply not even in the book. This book could have great but the author did not do enough homework. He needs to go back and try again using better researchers.
3,well loved - not that sturdy,"We bought this for our new kittens and they LOVED it, for about 2 months. But then they grew out of it and now no longer fit in it. It is a great toy for the first couple of months, but it is small and also over time they nibbled holes in the sides and broke the plastic frame. A great toy for a brief time..."
5,Great workbook,"My four year old daughter loves it, especially the part of the rewarding star stickers, she kept going doing so many pages at a time just to get a different color star. She finished it in only 5 weeks or something....I will buy the Kindergarten workbook next."
1,Disastrous purchase experience,"I purchased this workbook for over $30 thinking that it must be a pretty elaborate system with lots of stickers, brightly colored pages, etc. When it showed up in a crumpled Enfamil package, I almost threw it away assuming that it was a promotional thing from Enfamil. It turned out to be a used workbook, with newsprint type pages (cheap), with a Costco price tag on the front that said $9.49. When I contacted Amazon they told me that Amazon Marketplace sales were different from Amazon sales, but I still am not sure how one distinguishes Amazon Marketplace from Amazon. I contacted the seller to arrange a return and refund, and they sent me a label to return the item -- which I did a week ago -- but I have not yet heard anything about my refund. Overall, it was a very frustrating experience that made me lose a lot of faith in Amazon."
2,"Interesting, But Not Worth the Price","Brain Blain's CD is one of those novelty items that you might listen to a couple of times and then either sell or shelve. The songs lean towards the campy/cutesy side and cover subjects that the liner says ""make you feel good."" There are a couple of goods songs with catchy lyrics including the title track, ""Overqualified for the Blues"" and the CD opener ""Saab Story"" but overall, this CD lacks any lasting artistic value. If you are curious and for some reason feel compelled to buy this disc, try getting a used one at a discount rather than paying the full price."
5,Good resource for the Dummies in us all!,After having Webtv for two weeks I needed something like this. I was totally lost until received my copy. I am surprized that Webtv shippers don't pack a real guide like this. On screen helps are no help if you have to back-track a great deal. To save time.One key item was the 20 yellow pages of http address for Webtvers; Key items like where to find graphics and so forth.I would have gotten rid of my Webtv unit if t were not for this book.
3,"Good, for sombody just starting out on WebTV.","This is a good book for people who are just starting out on WebTV. I would suggest getting the book the same day you buy your WebTV. If you can figure things out very easly (Such as WebTV) I wouldn't recomend getting this, but you may want to just in case. But, for sombody who has had WebTV for awhile and knows about all the features, don't waste your money like I did. All it tells you is how to use everything.~Bobo100"
3,myth?,"I'm a bit disappointed that the author did not cite Wallace Smith's book of San Joaquin Valley history ""Garden of the Sun"". As a decendant of one of the main figures in the story, I tend to have a slanted view, but anything that gets some recognition of this important event in history is worth the read."
2,Not very useful,I agree with the other reviewers but like this book even less. The designs are bland and I haven't gotten any use out of them at all. There are much better design books out there from which you can make your own stencils.
4,useable,I think the best part of this book is that the stencils are useable. You can cut them right out. I wished there were a better variety though.
4,Fashionable Clothing: From the Sears Catalogs - Mid 1960s (S,i want to get some detail abt this book
5,One of Poul's Best,"I liked this book enormously. I was especially fond of the various side lines in the book involving the other alien races. Poul seemed to pack more ideas in this book than many authors manage in their lifetime. It is true that there aren't answers to everything, but that's what life is like. One of the best books I've read this year."
1,Ugh,"I love Poul's books and saw the nice title and cool cover art and went for it. 48 pages and three days later I decided to check the reviews. No wonder I could not read it. It is dull and the charaters are poorly developed and really no idea of whats happening. I just saved my self a week of my life not waisted. I quit. If I only had checked the reviews sooner. The last book I finished in one day, I am sure I could not have ever finished this one."
2,dull as dirt,"I picked up this book because I enjoyed Anderson's _The Boat of a Million Years_, and because the plot outlined on the back of the book looked interesting. Unfortunately, the book takes a long time to develop, both in terms of plot and pace. It plods along. I almost gave up at 50 pages, but things started to be happening, so I continued skimming for anything interesting. At 100 pages, there's now something going on, but I still have to suffer through way to much description of way too many boring events. I've given up on the book."
1,Unfinished,Black box science. Unbelievable sociology. Characters that seem like cardboard cutouts.The dog just ate the last chapter and I don't feel as though I'm missing out on anything.
2,Not the best I've read,"As a Sci-fi buff I've read some of the best books in this genre, but this book is not one of them. The book drags on and on in spots and that makes the whole experience of it less than enjoyable. If you like Anderson then you may love this book, but if this is your first Anderson novel then I'd suggest reading this one when you can't find anything else to read."
2,SOS,"Another exercise in maintaining a mind numbing political correctness by the numbers - a latino, a black, an indian, a Jewish scientist, an arab, a russian and the two white european males who turn out to be an insane killer and a wimp. Why do white males of european descent write books primarily for descendants of white europeans, making the bad guys descendants of white europeans? The science fiction is, well, been there done that. This isn't one of his better works. If current sf writers would can all of the feeble attempts to be politically correct to the point of absurdity, and concentrate on the story, maybe they would have more entertaining stories. This books just loses steam and I put it down about 4/5ths of the way through it."
1,Had potential but author didn't follow through.,"This book had plenty of good ideas and potential, but everytime you thought something should happen or a revelation should occur, nothing ever happened. Poorly written and a waste of time."
4,Exciting...In a way,"I've read Poul Anderson before and this is not his best work, but I would still recommend it. The way he tolled the story in fine detail was great except that it went on for the whole book. This novel would have been great! If it were about a 150 pages less."
4,Great story of well thought out scifi,"I loved this story. The aliens were very original, and well thought out, the evolution of Earth's society throughout the story was extremely well done and the human-alien relations were very good. I've not read much of Poul Anderson's work before but if his other stories are as good, or better than this I will definitly start reading more."
3,"Well written, but didn't capture my imagination","I have read the author in the past, and have enjoyed his works. I enjoyed this one also for the most part, but it just didn't excite me that much. To me the whole view of Starfaring presented in this book was rather sobbering. I suppose if and when we do travel the stars it could end up just like this book, but I hope not. Parts of the book dragged, and I guess I was hoping for a little more excitement and adventure when it came to encountering Alien species. The book was still well-written and many fans will enjoy it."
2,"tortured writing, disjointed story","I've read Anderson in the past and always had a problem with his crappy writing style. In this book he continuously refers to aliens as a different race rather than species, he uses inappropriate words when a different word would be a better choice, and his sentience construction is horrible.The redeeming factor is that Anderson presents some interesting ideas. Unfortunately he does so in a very clumsy manner. Even so, this is a better sci-fi book than much of what passes for sci-fi today.One of the biggest problems with this book is that it is put together from a collection of short stories published over many years and many of the asides have nothing to do with the main story, nor do they connect on their own. It is basically filler so they can fatten up the book. You could skip them and not lose a thing from the main story. The main story itself is long and boring and all of this together is why I am only giving this book two stars."
2,Knowledge of relativity may help,"I picked this up after reading that Anderson was a 'hard' sci-fi author. Having little understanding of science, I did not understand this book. Why do sci-fi writers write as though they are explaining ideas to get grant money? Anderson's ideas seemed cool, that we could draw near-infinite energy from a substrate universe, but still perplexing. Besides this, the story was boring, and Anderson used an irritating technique for dialogue. He'd state the character's attitude before the dialogue:""Angrily: Go home, Beatrice."" I hope Anderson's other books aren't like Starfarers as I am interested in reading Tau Zero."
1,Disappointing and dull,"Long and disjointed, I forced myself to finish this book, hoping against hope that the ending would rescue it. Not worth the effort to read and not in the league of Anderson's other work.I've never written a review, I actually felt the need to warn people about this book."
1,Test of the Chinese electrical heated sleeping bag,"I tested the electrical heated sleeping bag first with the battery. The warming effect was low and in the morning totally gone.Than - with a 12V source on some spots (connecting points, loop) it get overheated and burn holes in the fabric and on other spots it stays cold. There are only few wires - carbon fibers respectively for heating.The idea is good, but the electrical scheme is too primitive. There must be a temperature regulator and the distribution of the heat must be more homogeneous.Physicist & Wolfhart Willimczik [...]"
2,heated sleeping bag,The battery stated it was fully charged but did not heat the bag. Very disapponted because I was in below zero weather with only the non working sleeping bag.
1,FIASCO!,When I saw the cover of the DVD I though that this DVD will be the last Diana's concert in Las Vegas. But when I received I felt so frustrated and robbed that the DVD was recorded in 1979. The sound is awful and it is so hard to see Diane's face. I don't think is fair to promote a DVD using a recent face of Diane in order to sell an old recorded dvd. Please be more serious on this matter.
1,Horrible Quality,I have this concert on VHS and the quality is so much better from a 25 year old video tape then a new dvd. I was so excited to haveit perserved on DVD and I should have converted it myself because thats what it looks like a horrible conversion job. HBO should release theseconcerts and remaster them.
1,Misleading,"This Diana Ross DVD: ""Live From Las Vegas"" was misleading. The concert was one of Diana's performances back in the late 1970's - though the front cover depicts Diana Ross as she looked in the 1990's. Also, the picture quality of this DVD was very poor, which was a shame, being the concert seemed to be one of her best, at the height of her solo career. I also ordered another Diana Ross DVD: ""Diana Ross In Concert"", it having a ""different"" front cover, depicting when Ms. Ross was much younger, though this DVD ended up being the exact same concert as the other one, with same poor picture quality. Felt I got ""duped"" with these purchases, and have learned from this experience not to purchase items that aren't more explicit in their ""descriptions"" of merchandise."
3,a leakage problem,I love the way this stand was so easy to put up and the way it held my tree so very securely. What I didn't love was that I could not fill the base to the fill line since one of the corners apparently has a defect and leaked. Of course I didn't know this until the tree was up and partially decorate soI decided to wait until I took the tree down and see if it was something that could be easily fixed. It is not. Now I have to contact the company and see about how I can return it for replacement. If I get this problem fixed I would rate it 5 stars because for the first time I really was able to get the tree up and straight with no worries about it toppling---a real miracle to me!
1,Use it once then toss it out,"Bought this in 2006 and really liked the way it worked--easy, one-person tree set-up. The Krinner stands are great in concept--they use a cable mechanism to tighten a ""claw"" that holds the tree. It is much nicer than the cheaper, ""bolt type"" stands; however, locking mechanisms and the release are a bit confusing. The major problem is when I went to use the stand in 2007 the pedal mechanism would not tighten the cable. Either something was jammed or the cable had come loose--unfortunately there's no way to take the thing apart to find out. The build quality of the tightening mechanism is poor (note: my stand was marked ""Made in China""). The product warranty is vague and they require you to pay the shipping for product replacement."
2,Not Many Years of Use,"Loved this the first two years, the 3rd year it was a bit more difficult and this year two of the PLASTIC holders broke, almost hitting my husband in the eye. When you have a hole in the middle of a piece of lightweight plastic where the wire cording goes through, it doesn't take much tension over time to make them break. Another plastic prong broke after the tree was in so had to run out and get a different stand. Not worth the money it costs for this one!"
1,Works great! Breaks Fast!,"I used this for four Christmases and must say it was true love. It made putting up the tree so much easier than the screw type stands. This year I pulled it out and noticed that the pedal would not tighten the cable. Looking at the metal mechanism I noticed that it was completely worn and would not be able to work. I can't believe that the metal work inside is so flimsy that it wore out after using only four times. Yes, this works great and makes putting up the tree so easy. However, I can guarantee you that most of the positive reviews are from people who used it for the first time and were so happy at how much easier it is to put up a tree. Unfortunately I can only imagine their pain in just a few more Christmases."
5,very musical and stylish playing,"I bought this album because, at the time, I couldn't find the Leonhardt/Bruggen/et al version. I was used to that older recording with the flute, and, as a harpsichordist,(well, FORMER harpsichordist...I have since reverted to the piano) I have never been disappointed in the playing of Gustav Leonhardt. I must say that this group, Sonnerie, plays this elegant music with wonderful flair and zest. Very polished playing but with no sense of stuffiness. Their playing is exciting and fresh without being pretentious. I am speaking primarily of the Rameau. I'm not a big fan of Forqueray, but that has nothing to do with Mitzi Meyerson's performance...it is superb. This recording has a great ""presence."" I happen to like the fact that it sounds close, rather than farther away, as on a stage. I miss the baroque flute on ""La Livri"" and a few others, but that is a small price to pay for such a wonderful recording. Highly recommended."
2,Hey look--I speak Spanish!,"Previous reviews of this book seem to be divided into two camps--those who found this book an window into Mexican culture, and those who found the book, written by an Anglo, to be both presumptuous and pretentious. Now, I don't have a problem with anyone wanting to tackle someone else's culture, but I found the author's continual use of Spanish and worse, her translation of Spanish idioms into English unendurable. I think it doesn't really matter if you speak Spanish or not, either, since I lived in Spain and speak Spanish (though of course some of the Mexican words were unfamiliar to me) The ""Do you have long nails, daughter?"" phrase finally made me slam the book shut! Someone should have told both the author and the editor that using a foreign language in a narrative is like putting salt in a dish--a little goes a long, long way."
5,I'm grateful for this book,I love this book because it makes me see the world through the eyes of someone who can't take food on the table and a roof over her head for granted. The choices she makes in life and love are simpler and more complicated than ours because of that. For her to be able to remain grateful for her life both humbles me and touches me deeply.
3,Didn't like it at all.,"This has been on my list to read for several years, but it wasn't worth the effort. Don't waste your time."
4,Enjoyable Read,"I really enjoyed this book, but I do believe that if I knew more about Mexico I might not have liked it as much."
1,Kissing the Virgin's Mouth,"Very close to one of the worst books I've ever read about a dear subject (Mexico and Mexicans). If you love the Mexican culture and its people, you will find this book complete rubbish!"
1,Kissing the Virgin,"The book was delivered promptly and was in wonderful shape for a used book. However, I was not pleased with the author or the content of the book. Maybe I'm too old fashioned, but it was ""trash"" as far as I was concerned. There was no point to the slang words used, or their meanings, I didn't think. I would never recommend this book."
5,Beautiful and Informative,"Dojo Wisdom is both beautifully written and informative.. It isn't necessary to be a martial arts enthusiast to enjoy this book; the subtle, heartfelt wisdom is applicable to any situation, be it friendship, parenthood, or career struggles. Lawler has written an inspirational book for people who generally don't like 'inspirational' books, bringing her kindness and sagacity to the myriad struggles of everyday life. A perfect read for summer book clubs, and appropriate for any age. Read and be inspired to change your world, or perhaps just be a little braver and kinder as you navigate the potentialities of life."
1,No Compelling or Unique Content,"This book just seemed like bunch of unproven, nonresearch based silly ideas and exercises forcibly contrived to try to link martial arts habits with writing skills."
2,Very Disappointing,"Being an avid reader of wisdom literature and a searcher for great wisdom quotes and texts, I found this book very disappointing. I expected from the title, to find a book full of martial wisdom, but although there were a few interesting things found throughout this book, overall it contained very little useful wisdom for anyone who has done any studying at all in martial wisdom or worldly wisdom. The wisdom I did find in this book was very generic and can be found in almost any book on martial arts wisdom or philosophy.The beginning martial artist may find some use in reading this book, but if you have been in the martial arts for a while or have read some of the other books on martial arts wisdom and philosophy, I would recommend passing on Dojo Wisdom. There are better sources for the wisdom that you are seeking.Bohdi Sanders, author of Warrior Wisdom: Ageless Wisdom for the Modern Warrior"
1,Nothing original,"Picking and choosing from various sources, Lawler has a knack for choosing the most trite material. Nothing original here."
4,Interesting Definition of Warrior Frames this Book,"""Dojo Wisdom"" attracted me by its compelling title. It is a simple book, perhaps best taken in daily nuggets like a day book. The exercises are valuable and worthwhile.I was intriqued by Lawler's definition of ""warrior"". ""Living with courage and integrity. Facing difficulties and dignity, finding joy even in sorry.""My favorite component of the book was the brevity of the chapters (the 100 Simple Ways) and the practical applications of each nugget of wisdom.I imagine it would be excellent for those who are under time constraints or perhaps as a ""waiting in line"" book for when you are... naturally.... waiting in line!"
4,Good One Even for Non Martial Artists,"Jennifer Lawler's 'Dojo Wisdom' is a valuable book that contains:'100 Simple Ways to Become a Stronger, Calmer, More Courageous Person'.Although this book is a very good one for martial artists to read and absorb, it is also one that contains a great deal of value for anyone. Although most people probably think of them as physical pursuits, those who practice the traditional martial arts place a great emphasis on the mental aspects involved. Lawler has captured many of these and given practical applications in all areas of life.Even in sections with titles like `Speed is power' and `Never Lose Sight of the Blade' that sound very much like martial arts topics, Ms. Lawler has provided tips on how to incorporate these nuggets of wisdom into one's everyday life. Although I read it straight through, it might be good to read and ponder one of these lessons each day so that each can be focused upon for a time.This book will be worth your time."
2,Good but repetitive.....,"I love Paul Hauck's books and his approach to problems, depression and moving on with your life, however if you have read 'How to Love and Be Loved' and 'How to Stand Up for Yourself' then don't bother reading this book as it just repeats what is written in the other two."
5,A great resource,"This book has taken a place with my best ""teaching poetry"" resources. Full of activities, sample poems, and powerful lessons, I come back again and again for writing activities that will engage ALL of my writers. Kudos to Writer's Corps - both for this book and the amazing things they have accomplished with young adults!"
5,A great teaching resource!,"I am always looking for new ideas to use with my Creative Writing students, and this turned out to be a wonderful source of new ideas. Interesting, provocative, and critical activities can be adopted and adapted to many grade levels and abilities. I found this a first rate resource for my classroom."
3,Creative Writing Exercises,"I purchased this book while shopping for books on creative writing for a class. I teach high school, and this could come in handy for a resource. Each chapter has *several* fun writing exercises to get kids writing! Consider this resource book as your back up tool for rainy days or finding fun ways to engage students."
4,Confuse by season releases?,"I don't know if this is really season 3, but at least this 3-disc set includes another 13 episodes of the show. The good thing is that it contains the original aired sequence of the episodes. Belong to season 3 or continuing the episodes of season 2, it doesn't matter. Of course it's not the complete ""third"" season, episodes like another ""Mikey Special"" and the ""Christmas Special"" are missing. This season ends with the ""David Mann Bike (Biker Legend Chopper)"" episodes. As a DVD description, it has nice intros, episodes selection and the ""Jr. vs Sr."" episode as special feature. Unfortunately for people interesting in other languages, it does NOT include any subtitles (spanish,french,...), but it includes closed captions."
5,Puritan Revival!,Packer does an outstanding job imparting the Purtain's' Christian beliefs and how it relates to our everyday walk with Christ.
2,wrong item,I ordered this item and recieved a white stien with Gordon's portrait & old car on it instead of the one shown. it was a Christmas gift so i did not have time to return it so i ate the mistake.
2,dissappointed,I was not impressed with this book although I'm a big fan of Focus on the Family and Dr. Dobson. I just felt this book didn't deliver much at all. I think Boundaries with Teens would be a much better choice. I actually have the book on CD. I listen while waiting to pick kids up from school. It offers a lot of great advice and suggestions on life with teens.
4,Raising Teenager Right,Book is a great resource and not too long an easy read. Good advise from James Dobson and I highly recommend it.
5,Excellent value!,"As soon as I took this comforter out of the box, my husband was in love! We have been through several comforter sets in the last year, and he's found fault with each one. He likes everything about this one: the color, the texture, the softness, and the color is so soft and subdued it can go with a lot of different decors. I especially loved the price. Even better, I selected Super Saver Shipping for my order and it arrived in only two days rather than the two weeks that was estimated."
4,Great resource!!!,"This book is a great resource for getting outdoors and finding a trail as the title states. I will also say it covers a lot, but the biggest let down was there are no trail maps. Overall it does provide you with a wealth of knowledge to find and determine where you would like to venture on your next expedition.""Hint"" most of the maps can be located on-line."
3,MK Morse AV25 Hole Saw1 9/16 inch,"The saw does do a good job cutting the hole. I can live with it, but the saw doesn't have a good fit to the arbor.As you put the saw on the arbor I noticed the holes in the saw are to big for the arbor pins. This makes the saw always loose to your feel. These holes need to line up better and fit the pins on the arbor.The saw will cut the hole for you, loose pins and all. I also bought a 1 5/8 inch. The same problem extist with it.I will look around on my next hole saws, I just don't like the movement when you got everything tight and ready to go.I did buy the arbor that was recomended for me to get for these saws (I've forgot the number right now, I'll have to look it up). So I think I have the right one. I hope I'm right!!! I have only cut wood so far and I put holes in it."
3,This tool works fine to tighten the bottom bracket on my Schwinn,"I wanted to get this tool to do what is supposed to be monthly maintenance of tightening the bottom bracket on my Schwinn Avenue Hybrid(same as Midmoor). I have to use the smaller end, and can't fit the bigger end in like I anticipated, but it does work. It allows me to adjust the bottom bracket without going through the pain of pulling off the crank arm, which over time, could lead to wearing out the aluminum crank arm, making for a sloppy fit. I gave it three stars because I can't use the bigger end in between the crank arm, and bottom bracket, but it does work, and I can think of no other tool that would let you do this adjustment without pulling off the aluminum crank arm. I do recommend this inexpensive tool, if you own one of the lower cost Schwinn like I do."
4,good reference book,Helpful for reference purposes. I am working on a novel and wanted to mention some movies and tv shows with medical themes. This was a quick way for me to get correct info without sorting through a lot of research.
2,more list than informativ book,"I expected more the lexica-type of filmbook, where all the important ""Doctor on Screen""-films are listed and reviewed. Instead this book consist of a long list of films in which a doctor appears (even if it's only for 30 seconds.... - for exsample Polanski's ""Frantic"" which features a cardiologist as profession - but has no influcene on the film...) There are only the most important filmcredits listed and the story is only covered by 1 to 2 sentence. There are no pictures at all!!!. at least there is a bibliography, a list of related web-sites, a subject-index(from cancer to epilepsy till x-ray) and a name index. This rather expensive book is only usefull when used as a source to find other films. Alternative Book ""Hollywood Doctors"" by Jean-Claude Suares, currently out of print"
5,Sensei comments from a high school sophomore (2001),"I was searching for a book with fast paced action, adventure, and heck, maybe a little romance for flavor, and I camr upon sensei. The story of rising from the weak and the transformation Yoshi made is enthralling....END"
3,What about baby boom right-wingers?,"It's a shame that this book title is used as simply one more right-wing diatribe. Baby Bush is also a baby boomer, and he shows that the disaster of the baby boomers is not limited to the narcissistic extremists of the left"
1,"Excuuuse me, but no","Just stop it. Whose taxes do you think paid for all those ""Greatest Generation"" retirees to sit on their butts in retirement? Oh, yeah, it was us. And which generation was on the front lines in the fight against institutionalized racism? Oh yeah, that was us, too. Vietnam? Yeah, we went there too. One of the reasons many of never trusted the government again. Stable employment? Not in my generation. Employees are disposable now. Maybe that's why we figured out that employment is purely a commercial arrangement. Loyalty? Don't make me laugh."
5,Boomers are Busted,"The Boomers can no longer hide. Mordente and Aliano expose the Boomers for what they are in this Michael Savage style-come right at you with the facts book. An enjoyable read that should be required for all those who have no political identity, as those on the right will line up exactly with this thesis and those on the left are the subject of the book, while undecided will get an education they could not pay for in school at for the price of the book. I eagerly await the sequel. (The Next Generation?)"
4,Now I know...,"I am only about 3/4 the way through this book, but had I read it a few years ago, I probably wouldn't have stock investments and wouldn't have seen my retirement funds go down the tube as they have."
1,Decent effort but boring damn read.,"Some books are vast in scope and others are half-vast. This is sadly a rather half-vast effort. Reading it I couldn't help but think that the author was given an advance, a deadline, and a minimum word count to meet and that's it. Otherwise it's hard to understand how something so unorignial and meandering ended up in book form.That said, I'll commend the author for doing the institutional and market research, most of which was probably valid, but I'll ask him at the same time why it felt necessary to rehash the work of so many other solid Wall Street writers who've said all this already, and certainly more succinctly.Buy this if your curiousity is overwhelming, but not until you've crossed everything off your ""to read"" list first."
5,Great reading!,Gary Weiss' book is absolutely fascinating in the amount of dirt it uncovers and explains. After reading I became quite disillusioned of Wall Street professions and people that hold them. It really opens one's eyes to the amount of smartly disguised corruption and shady practices that Wall Street firms actively employ as part of their 'normal' business under convenient indifference of Securities and Exchange commission.I would recommend everyone to follow Gary's blog.
2,bridge book,"I wish I had been told this book was almost 40 years old. I llove MikeLawence writings, but I thought this should have been info available to buyers. GRUMPY from Carmel, Ca"
5,How to read your oppenents cards,excellent book. It is very helpful for my husband who is learning to ply bridge
5,MUST-READ book,"Mike Lawrence is one of the most intelligent authors I have ever read (and I read a lot). This is also one of his better-organized and readable books (surprisingly his first book). Reading this book will teach you how to think at the table. Counting is a skill that separates the novice from the expert, and this book goes a long way towards teaching you that vital skill. This book is among my three favorite Mike Lawrence books, the other two being ""Play Bridge with Mike Lawrence"", and ""Play a Swiss Teams of Four With Mike Lawrence"". Another vital skill taught here is deduction. A simple but very useful example: as declarer if you are missing AK of a side suit, and the opening lead is something else, then either the opening leader is missing both cards or the honors must be split, else the A or K would be the natural lead (assuming neither defender has bid)."
3,Decent book for intermediate players,"Mike Lawrence is not the best bridge writer language-wise but his books usually teach very valuable lessons (Balancing, Judgement at Bridge, Card Combinations, etc). Most of other books he writes contain mostly his own thoughts, rather than the same old rules the uncreative writer repeats and the well-read reader already knows.Except this one. I doubt experienced players will learn anything new here---counting points, counting shape, visualizing your opponents' hands are routine in any decent player's toolkit. However, there is a final chapter on reading your OPPONENTS (gestures, hesitation, etc) that is a bit more interesting (but not necessarily very useful)."
5,Great Book,This book will help you reduce your guesswork at the table by showing you how to recognize and take advantage of the many clues available from the bidding and play. Worth reading.
4,"Easy to Use, Nice result",I was able to layout the court and paint it in about 45 minutes. The template is well marked and easy to use. All tt took was measuring the starting point and the rest of the court (including the three point line) all fell into place. After it dried I was able to repack the template for use again after I sealcoat my drive in the spring....
1,USELESS,"This is a pointless product. The triangle is too tiny, can't reach the middle of the pan. Both of mine were not flat like the picture, but angled downward at the point so the thing wouldn't lie flat even if it fit any modern pie pan. Finally, the height of the ""back"" is too short for any of my pans, which include new, antique, glass, aluminum and foil. With the rim present, the angle can't be adjusted. I am mad at myself for not trying it before giving it as part of a gift, too; giftee will be too nice to tell me what she thinks of it and I'll probably have to pack it if she ever moves again. Do NOT buy this product!"
4,"Typed by a child, written by an expert!","Unfortunately, this Kindle edition has so many typos it looks like it was typed by a child using a Kindle keyboard. Still a fabulous book by a fabulous author. If you're having trouble, the hard copy is much better for transcription accuracy!"
5,New favorite series,"Every time I think that the series I just finished is my favorite, I start another one. And it becomes my favorite. I loved Talia and didn't think I would like the series based on Elspeth as much, but I was wrong. It's a fun read and the new characters are fantastic :)"
2,Sadly Mangled,"I was delighted to get a digital version of this much-beloved book, but my pleasure in it was short-lived. A few typos in a book don't mar the story, but this particular ebook has so many that it makes reading very challenging, if not impossible. I see that I'm not the only one who has complained, so I'd really like to know why Amazon hasn't contacted the publisher to arrange for corrections and replacement. This is the second time I've paid for this book, after all, and I'd like the reading experience to compare."
3,E-Reader Version Doesn't Live Up,"I read this in hard copy and bought it for my kindle so I could reread one of my favorite Valdemar books. However, approximately every twentieth word with the letter r is spelled incorrectly with some words so garbled as to be incomprehensible. Having to draw back on my knowledge from previous readings seriously detracts from my enjoyment of an otherwise amazing book. Long story short: don't buy the e-version. Zero star rating compared to a five star book."
4,SHOCKINGLY BAD TRANSCRIPTION,The Kindle edition has the worst transcription errors that I have ever seen. Many of them are so bad that it is impossible to parse what the text should be. Why is this so difficult for publishers to fix? I bet if they didn't want to spend staff time proofreading they could get readers to volunteer for it.
3,For Kindle edition,"While I have an opinion about this book, this review is regarding the kindle edition. I have never seen a book so poorly edited prior to publishing. It was as if they had a machine transcribe the book and performed no review to ensure the quality before making the transcription available for purchase. There are spelling errors, nonsensical punctuation, format issues, as well a other problems with the text. For a writer or editor, these issues were incredibly distracting."
4,One of my all time favorite industrial albums,"""Timekiller"" is the very first song I ever heard by Project Pitchfork. A good friend of mine had burned the song on a compilation cd she made for me years ago. I finally got around to buying Daimonion after all these years. I had to get it because at the time I was getting ready to see the band live at Ground Zero in Minneapolis. All the Project Pitchfork albums that I had listened to (and at one point owned), Daimonion is my personal favorite. The songs are definitely slower than on the other albums that I had heard. Asides ""Timekiller"", I really enjoy listening to the songs ""Jupiter"" (a beautiful ballad) and ""We Are One"". The melodies stands out more with me and the lyrics resonates with me more so than other Project Pitchfork albums. I think the album certainly could have been edited better. I feel like it was a little too long. Fifty-five minutes would have been more appropriate. Overall I enjoy Daimonion immensely."
5,Great Diving Book,This is a great introductory book on diving! I'm just a novice (not even certified yet) but after reading it I can imagine it'd be highly useful even for experienced divers as it does delve deeply into diving theory.
5,For Scuba Divers of All Levels,"This book was extremely helpful when I started to learn scuba diving. I was not required to have a text for my basic scuba diving course and this is a book I purchased to give myself more information. Now that I'm working on getting certified to be a teaching assistant (NAUI) for basic scuba diving, this book helps me maintain the knowledge that I learned in the basic course. I do recommend this book for any one and everyone interested in diving as a career, sport, or hobby."
4,Very good recognition,"I have been progressively upgrading this program starting with version 2. this was yet another improvement in recognition and accuracy. I continue to be a strong advocate for Naturally Speaking. If you are a doctor and want to save on transcription, this is a very good option. It is well worth the cost and quickly pays for itself."
5,Better than expected,"After reading the other review, i was a little leary. But the quality and functioning of the screwdriver is great. I am very pleased"
2,my son loves this show,"and we have tried to get him most of these action figures because he REALLY likes them.BUT, this cannonbolt came apart in the car before we even got it home and has not worked well since then. its unfortunate,because my little guy deserves a toy that will hold up to his affections."
2,NOT ENOUGH TECHNIQUE DETAIL,The pantings are nice and colorful and mostly in oil but not enough technique shown to really be of help.
2,"A Native American girl struggles through conflicting feelings about a new classmate, a coyote and her own artistic talen","Francie lives on a reservation in California, near the mountain called Higher Than The Arrow. She's the best artist in her class and already going through moody teenage angst when a new classmate arrives. Lucy tries to be friendly, but Francie's focus on her latest project - a Saint Francis statue with a coyote - makes her disinterested in the new girl. Her wariness that Lucy - also an artist - is stealing her thunder turns to rage, and leads to an uncharacteristic act.A brooding coming-of-age story with a female protagonist, and one not focused on sex? Amazing. I didn't particularly like it - Francie's unlikeable to say the least - but it's impressively different."
5,A good start to anyone who wants a good Happy Hardcore collection,"A very awesome CD collection, done buy the pros. Brilliant remixes; even if you've heard the originals I'd recommend buying this CD just to hear the genius of these remixes. When ever I want to introduce someone to Happy Hardcore or Gabber, I choose songs from this CD. True rave songs in here, including the ultimate classics like Visa - Fly away (Hixxy Remix) and Scott Brown & DMO - Fade Away. Not really a lot of true Gabber songs here, about two or three goods ones, but it's a balance none the less.Critical Review stats:7 songs rated five star (Utterly amazing)23 songs rated four star (Very well done)17 songs rated three star (Good)4 song rated two star (Under-par)0 songs rated one stat (Awful)"
5,Just Listened To It On WWW.DI.FM!,"WOW!,If you like hardcore of Faster vocal trance this is the best set your ever going to get! it's amazing just amazing and a great value $42.99 for 3 disc set it's a steal! order this NOW if you like Hardcore or Trance it's so solid!"
5,Wow!,"What a compilation!! If you like abit of hardened commercial trance then buy this CD.... NOW! The reason I say ""hardened"" is because although this compilation still contains slightly cheesy trance, true to the spirit of Clubland, most of the tunes are remixed to make them a little more head-banging. CD1 and CD2 contain much of the same type of music with the likes of Cisco Kid - Pizzaman, Scooter - Weekend, Head Horny's - My Hero, FNP - Kiss This (Voodoo & Serano remix) and Voodoo & Serano - Blood, Uproar - The Roof is on Fire and Piano Pirates - On My Own all featuring. CD1 is a great CD to listen to when you're getting psyched up to hit the town, play it LOUD and it'll get your head banging in no time! Clubland Extreme is without a doubt one of the best clubbing CD's around and worth every penny."
1,Missing disk,"While the first cd in this compliation was good, the second disk was missing and was another non related disk was in it's place."
5,Primal Rage Forever !,"Hi. I wrote about this book before, under the name Sauron. Well now Chaos is also my favorite. So this time I will put my name as Chaos. PR The Avatars book rules! CHAOS AND SAURON ARE THE BEST!"
2,Something to chew on.,"If you are a Primal Rage fan, then you'll probably love this book, almost all of them have. However most Primal Rage fans are very young as in twelve and below.Vornholt tries to incorporate all the gods and give them each a unique personality but ends up shining on only a few namely Blizzard and a little bit of Vertigo (my personal favorite, and I must say he did her no justice.)The game is about the gods. The book is about seven special worshippers that have been linked to their gods.Vornholt has a tendency to confuse his characters during the battle scenes and makes a nice amount of typos as well. The plot is boring and typical. You won't find anything profound in this read.It's pulp fiction in it's purest form."
5,John Vornholt RULES!!!,"I read this book when I was 10 and it has remained my favorite book to this day. John Vornholt is the best author in my mind, and I am so happy to see everyone else here agrees with me that this books is fantastic. Next time I read this book it will be my 7th time, and I'm sure I'll love it as I always have.One more thing, for the ongoing favorite pick of God, I've gotta go with Vertigo."
2,Editor needed,"David Roberts needs a strong editor, one who is not afraid to exercise some control. I love this topic, but after 100 pages I found it all too easy to put this book down. Two things made it less than stellar reading: (1) There is probably too much disjointed trivia (I say ""probably"" because some readers may want every word of it). The writing simply didn't flow for me. (2) Roberts should be taken to the woodshed for his pretentious vocabulary, such as using ""punition"" when ""punishment"" would be the appropriate word. This happens on every page. He reminds me of a very insecure professor I had who would say such things as ""the largesse of the Greek theater,"" when he meant the ""largeness."" The goal of every writer should be to communicate, not to exhibit psuedo-erudition. PS: I taught my first college English class in 1967, so, yes, I have a little experience in these things."
4,"A Newer World, by David Roberts","By all means read this book if your interest is in John Fremont and Kit Carson. I gave 4 stars due to the same reasons already mentioned. I think though that either Roberts lacked confidence in his writing ability and so 'beefed up' his verbage or he was following the advice of an editor. Actually the wording would have been OK if consistently used beginning to end, instead the reading evidences sporadic uncommon wordage. Nevertheless, Roberts has written a book that really is worth the read!"
3,Judgemental,"If you want to read an exciting informative book about these two guys, read Blood and Thunder by Hampton Sides. I read this book to get that extra bit of detail and what I got was an author who was always second-guessing everyone's motives. He has really nothing good to say about Jessie Fremont. Didn't like ole' JCF too much either.Sometimes people themselves don't know their motivations. They just do things.He was very upset that Fremont and the US ruined the paradise that once was CA. I don't know if he missed the memo, but the year after 1848 was 1849. The gold miners were almost there. Also CA may have been a paradise to the big land owners, not so much for the poor Mexicans and Indians.It was like he looked back over history where the end is known from the beginning and said, they should have turned left here, should have said this in this manner, ad infinitum."
3,"It,s was OK","Their were to many hearts and they were to close together for me, I would want somethings different in next orders."
4,great product for the price,"this is a really nice anklet, the hearts are simpler than the picture shows, but I really like it, and I wear it every day."
1,broken,"How can I review something was broken when I got it.And having hard time getting it replace or get it chargeback to my account. So you can put this in review I don'tcare I'm upset cause I didn't open it 1st before givingit to my granddaughter for her B-day. So as you can seeUPSET GRANDMA. The reason broken is who ever pack it putit in square box , not long box they force it in the small box.MaryEllen Parr"
2,Gold In the Rough,"The extensive research which the author had access to has not overcome her basic faults in the structuring ot the book. Two pioneer women of the mid-nineteenth century are not given their proper place in history and have not been given a cohesive retelling of the adventures of their lives. The book consists of more than thirty chapters, many illustrations, a forward, an index and pages of notes and bibliography but the book does not have a clear and focused plan. Bits and pieces are popping up at the slightless turn of thought. The material is there but it is like wading through the Isthmus of Panama with unlaced tennis sneakers. The thought strays with each plodding footstep."
4,Tell it like it is...,"A must buy if you are looking to purchase a post-war Triumph. The book really cuts to the chase and tells it up front. It is a good resource for distinguishing the differences in model years and what things to look for in each.The book is a little hard to take as a Triumph enthusiast when he cuts up certain models. ""The TR6... was old when it was new... the design was ancient, the car got lousy gas mileage... it was never bolted together properly"" Hey!!! That's my baby.Just don't let this book scare you away from owning a Triumph altogether. As the author states ""All Triumphs are a good value"". I personally would just say it with more enthusiasm"
3,Huge! Not what I expected.,"I bought this for my boat, as it came with no way to stow rods. Twice as big as I expected. Definitely made for large rods and reels. Makes me think I should be on a charter boat in the Bahamas with a 9-foot heavy action rod and a 5 pound reel. Good if that's what you need. I returned it."
4,Expanded my rod storage,"This is exactly like the rod holders that came with my pontoon boat. I used zip ties to secure it to the outside of the boat rail near the back of the boat to provide rod storage away from the area where people are casting their rods. Good quality, fast delivery."
2,Broken,"Poor packing. Candles were in a box, each wrapped in plastic. Opened the plastic and one candle is broken completely in half."
2,Major Letdown,After buying the first two releases.I was very much looking forward to getting this.This doesn't come anywhere close to the others.It could very well be a collection of bad America b sides.
2,Please stick with Wilco only!!,First off do not purchase this album if you think it will have any sort of an Alt-Country influence. I love all types of music and thought I would give this album a try sense it got so many good reviews. Wilco is one of my favorite bands and I figured the base player from such a great band would have carried over some of his musical influences. I found the music to be very blah and the lyrics uninspired. Normally when I purchase a new cd I listen to it untill I can't stand to anymore but with this album I was sick of it within a few listens.
4,Techno Reggae,"Masters of dub, Sly and Robbie bring us the future of reggae with this eclectic blend of techno, pop, and latin styles. The Japanese animation is fitting, but sometimes too repetitive. Overall, a unique musical experience."
3,Black Blade,"I haven't heard this power metal album, but I've read mixed reviews of it. In any event, the subject of inspiration for the entire album is Michael Moorcock's Elric of Melnibone fantasy novel series. Like Tolkien, it's been done before. In this case, by Hawkwind, Blue Oyster Cult, and Cirth Ungol."
2,mediocre,The premise of this book attracted me. Sounds like a compelling read but disjointed and boring. I made it through to the ending but disappointed in content.
2,Does not live up to its promise,"The story of the Collyer brothers is an interesting premise to start with; unfortunately, Mr. Lidz does not do it justice. The book is poorly written in a disjointed manner. He tries to integrate tales of his own family with the story of the Collyers but fails to weave them together in a cohesive, understandable manner. It is rare that I don't finish reading a book, but this one went straight to the archive after I got about a quarter of the way into it."
2,"Ghosty Men: The Strange but True Story of the Collyer Brothers, New York's Greatest Hoarders, An Urban Historical","I found the book to be very monotonous and ordinary, it didn't seem to have a energetic flow throughout the story line."
3,I've read better,I had heard about the Collyer brother's from a friend of mine. I found the main story of the brothers interesting but was not interested in the author's uncle's story which seems to take up about 1/2 of the book. Had I realized how much was non-Collyer related I think I would have passed it by.
3,The original hoarders,"A little long in the tooth in some spots, but,these brothers would of put the hoarders TV show to shame. Enjoyed this read. Brought in alot of history about New York."
2,This is not a biography or an intense study of the Collyer brothers,"The book jacket is hauntingly beautiful. But the insides are disappointing. Rather than place the focus on the Collyer brothers (known for not coming out of their brownstone forever...like in that Peter Sellers movie, ""Being There,"" now that I come to think of it...) he uses them to tell a story of his life. Not Fair."
3,CLOSE BUT NO CIGAR,"I picked this book up with great anticipation expecting to read a fabulous, intresting account about the fabbled ghosty men. What a great subject for a book - unfortunately Mr. Lidz either didn't see the great potential or wasn't up to the task. Ghosty Men is extremely disappointing. It wanders all over the place. Undeveloped stories about their exploits are all over the place. Continuity is lacking, making it very difficult and annoying to follow without having to go back to previously stated facts (or never stated) to understand things clearly. The real sorry part is that this had potential to make a really good book from a number of differnt angles, all of which could have been woven into a marvelous tapestry. Unfortunately, Mr Lidz lacks the knowledge of weaving and flow. To bad. I imagine some movie studio will pick up on what could have been accomplished and will probably produce an informative, important, and maybe even fun work."
1,No Text to Speech,"I will not purchase books without text to speech enabled. I mean really, once I have purchased it, I should be allowed to do what I want, so long as it is not illegal and I am not pirating it. This means that I should be able to listen to the book as well as read it."
2,Sketchy and All Over the Place,"I was expecting a riveting account of the life of the Collyer brothers, the famous New York hoarders, but instead I found a dis-jointed and jumpy book that appeared to be based on a couple of old newspaper articles about the brothers, plus a long middle section about the author's Uncle Arthur, who was also a hoarder. There is almost a whole chapter about the author going to a flea circus. ??? What does that have to do with the Collyers?I was hoping to get a little insight into why people live this lifestyle, but Lidz doesn't really touch on any of that. We learn nothing about the psychology of the Collyers, and in fact, Lidz tells the story about them from the perspective of a reporter, police and other outsiders. Lidz doesn't seem to know what he wants to be telling us in this book.Very disappointed."
4,Factual and fascinating...,"This is a factual account of the Collyer brothers, as opposed to E.L. Doctrow'sHomer & Langley: A Novel. Not as lyrical and evocative but more factual. Throughout the story the author intertwines the story of the Collyer brothers with tales of his Uncle Arthur who was also a hoarder. His is a very intimate and personal story of why a person is driven to this behavior. The author also mentions going to the Hubert's Freaks show in New York which was the subject of Gregory Gibson's fascinatingHubert's Freaks: The Rare-Book Dealer, the Times Square Talker, and the Lost Photos ofDiane Arbus. A book I highly recommend."
5,"Easily outshines Doctorow's ""Homer & Langley"".","Having recently read Doctorow'sHomer & Langley: A Novel, I'm here to tell you that Lidz's charming little volume is much more enjoyable and entertaining. Lidz does a wonderful job of introducing the reader to three eccentric characters, thereby opening doors to rooms that are seldom, if ever, seen by others. That's it! Short and sweet . . . just like the book!"
3,A True Horror Story,"An interesting book that tells the disturbing story of the legendary Collyer brothers of Harlem, who were hoarders extraordinaire. Interspersed with their history are accounts of the author's own Uncle Arthur - whose life probably gave more understanding and sympathy to Mr. Lidz in his recounting of the brothers' sad, eccentric lives. Many of us have an instinct to hoard (hopefully, only to some small extent) be it groceries, books, paper clips, ticket stubs, the various minutiae of our lives, but may we be delivered from the overpowering obsession that these individuals displayed, and by which they were consumed."
1,One of the most poorly written books I've ever encountered....,"This purports to be the story of the 2 brothers who were hoarders. Conservatively, 60% of the book is simply New York history. The story is not cohesive, and when not relaying New York history the author only devotes about 20% of the book to the ""Ghosty Men"" while the other 20% is devoted to the rest of his rather eccentric family. It's almost like it's been written in peices. Some paragraphs are very entertaining but they seem to be stuck in the middle of a history lesson on the city.Very choppy, not on topic. Wouldn't recommend to anyone unless you're intersted in an abbreviated history of Harlem & old New York city."
1,Right On C. Demar!,"Although the review was written in 2005, I strongly agree with C. Demar's thoughts on this book. It should have been titled, ""My Family, With a Tiny Bit of the Collyer Brothers Thrown In To Get People To Buy My Book""! Boring and self-indulgent...the most interesting part of the book is the cover! Total waste of money and time..."
4,Too short for such an interesting topic,"Lidz tells the story of his uncle Arthur, a hoarding man his mom called ""the lost Collyer brother."" Along with this story, he gives us a journalistic recounting of the life and deaths of the Collyers, the famed Harlem packrats. There are many details here about the lives of the Collyers I haven't found elsewhere, and as a bonus, you get a quickie history of Harlem and a truly loving portrait of Uncle Arthur. If you're interested in the phenomenon of hoarding, you will enjoy the dizzying pile of a life portrayed in this book. But it is a very short book, with a jumpy, dashed-off style. I am probably rating it a little higher than I would if the subject matter didn't interest me so deeply."
5,Fascinating,"I ran across a reference to this book while reading another book, and had to check it out. What an interesting and sad story of hoarding in the early part of last century. Thought provoking. Glad I ran across it."
3,Fascinating Glimpse into the Historical Case of the Hoarding Collyer Brothers,"This was an interesting glimpse into the history of hoarders. This obsessive-compulsive disorder has become popular TV fare in recent years. It was interesting to read about two men who suffered from this obsession in the last century. In addition to the story of the Collyer brothers, Franz Lidz provided personal anecdotes about a family member with the same propensities. Overall, the book was an interesting read."
4,Double Vision,"""It was unfair when you looked so much like that small dot of stupidity that was in you, as if that dot were the whole of it and nothing more.""--""Molly Flanagan and the Holy Ghost."" This novel invites us into a little girl's world with precious detail and smart, hard-hitting statements such as the one above that open a window on the world by moving past the story at hand and shedding light on Living. Skinner paints her characters with a fine touch--she captures the ache of a younger sister with a intellectual, talented brother who just seems to Do Everything Well. And you learn to love Molly, with her double vision and her religious obsessions, her frustrated piano playing and her intuition about other people's troubles. I am very surprised that this is an out-of-print book but perhaps someone will soon come to their senses and put it back into circulation."
1,Only if you want to rip your hair out,"It does not take a 200 page book to help you plan a wedding. If you read the entire book you will feel exhausted, bewildered, and claustrophobic. I bought a used copy and know why someone resold it. After two wedding checklists they got rid of it. If you want to be a Bridezilla and have your family and friends disown for making them memorize their cheat sheets go ahead and follow the book to a tee."
3,"Oddly written, but beautiful","Never thought I'd recommend a book published by ""FERAL HOUSE,"" but that's not the only kooky thing connected to RUSS COLUMBO AND THE CROONER MYSTIQUE. The materials on which the authors based their book are very thorough, but no one is ever going to give Russ Columbo the Stephen hawking award for brains, so page after page of his intimate correspondence, and that of his brain-dead pals, palls after a little while. The photos are great and seem to prove the long-vaunted notion that at some point in his career, perhaps to improve his chances with Indiana-born Carole Lombard, Columbo endured a primitive nose-job of the Gertrude Atheron style. There are two kinds of people, and one of them is the kind that will love this biography to death, and the other kind will prefer to appreciate it, and its James-Ellroyisms, at a safe distance. Kudos to its authors, who dared to sail into the mind of a shallow man for quite a long time."
4,CROSBY AND THEN COLUMBO,"READ THIS BOOK IF YOU LIKE THE 20S , 30S, HOLLYWOOD AND MUSIC. COLUMBO HAD A NICE PERSONA AND VOICE BUT HE WAS ONLY A CROSBY RIVAL FOR A SHORT TIME AND BY THE TIME OF HIS TRAGIC DEATH HE WAS NEVER GOING TO BE ANY BIGGER AND WAS ON A DOWN HILL SLIDE. HE WAS NO LONGER ANYWHERE NEAR A RIVAL OF BINGS.COLUMBOS TYPE AND HIS SONG STYLE WAS OUT AND HIS PICTURE WORK WAS NIL.HE WAS GOING OUT LIKE VALENTINO, AMERICA AND ITS TASTES HAD CHANGE. CROSBY WAS HIS FRIEND AND A PALLBEARER.I HAVE READ MANY BOOKS AND POLICE REPORTS AND THIS WAS A TRAGIC MISTAKE. HE AND THIS BROWN WERE MORE THAN PROBABLY LOVERS AND HIS SUPPOSED LOVE WITH LOMBARD WAS A BEARD FOR HIS TRUE SEXUAL LEANINGS BECAUSE SHE WAS A GOOD FRIEND.THIS BOOK IS A MUST READ SO COLUMBO ISNT FORGOTTEN BECAUSE HE WAS A PLAYER IN THE HISTORY OF MUSIC.HE WAS NEVER GOING TO BE ON A LEVEL WITH BING OR LATER FRANK, DEAN, OR PERRY BUT FEW ARE.READ THIS BOOK."
2,Oops! Forgot to add the color!,"An early B-western from Roger Corman, this low budget film features fine performances from Lloyd Bridges and Joan Taylor. Unfortunately, what it doesn't contain is color! The film was shot in color, but Columbia, inexplicably, has it on VHS in black-and-white. Save your money. Maybe they'll get right for a long-overdue DVD release."
2,Disappointing,We did not like the arrangements on this disc. The key/ timing/ tempo were weird. Do not recommend it. We will probably never use this again.
2,About Joe Carran...,"Hi!I'm Joe Carran...or should I say: that's the name the record company people ""gave"" me for these mid-price recordings I do (partly) for a living!IF ANYBODY CARES, I will explain some of the major mistakes regarding this name or ""Ricardo Caliente"" for that matter, i.e. what I actually played or someone else played and why...on what equipment and so on.Also I would like to get in touch with Tage from Norway, because of his cool comments, and because he popped the question ""Who is Joe"" (and I'm originally from Norway as well)...Anyway, I just thought some of You might find the real information useful, so drop me a line - e-mail: thecore@get2net.dkMerry Christmas!Jon Kjrran, Odense, Denmark"
4,CD in a jewel case,"Who is Joe? The backing tracks and producing stand out quite well. The guitar follows the vocal phrasing of the Eagles pretty good. When getting to the ""three layered vocal beatiful harmonic chorus stepping up three half notes from E major to G major"" (The Bridge) in New Kid in Town, Joe manages to keep the magic intact. Simply he plays the 1. 3. and 5. note on the guitar which is equal the G major chord etc. instead of overdubbing. Neat. This record is perfect for an Eagle's fan. Buy it, you won't be dissapointed. I got it for the amount of three dollars in Rema Jessheim. Why pay more?"
4,Deserving desserts,"Not only are the pictures good enough to eat, so are Ms. Lucchetti's culinary delights. The book is full of her insights and inspirations; this is so helpful to the reader/aspiring chef who has none. The cookie recipes can be tedious and need the hands of an experienced chef and a decent kitchen. However, there are many other recipes to keep one busy baking.The chocolate cream cheese brownie recipe is the most superior version I have tried. The cinnamon rolls were a huge disappointment but this could be the aspiring chef's faulty yeast. The photographs are some of the most luscious around. This book is a keeper which explains why there is a wait to buy this delectable hardback. Bon appetit."
3,"Great ideas, insufficient instruction for execution","I have tasted many of these desserts at Stars but found that recreating them at home was frustrating. Many recipes are overladen with butter and often produce too much or too little material for the pan or dish specified. I suspect little time was spent testing these recipes. If you have the inclination and time to do the testing yourself, many of the recipes are worth the effort."
5,Stars Desserts,AS a New pastry chef 8 years ago I came across this book... I used it soooo much in so many recipes the book binding fell off and the book was lost. I cannot wait to get another copy of this book. it is excellent.
1,IF QUALITY SOUND IS FOR YOU....THIS IS NOT,"Before you buy this, have a look at the 6 volume compilation from JSP RECORDS[...]After having had both compilations in my hand to review, the JSP was the obvious choice.The audio quality, fats's complete recordings (sideman or own billing), liner notes, discographical information and economic accessibility (less than $30 per 4 cd volume) are reasons enough. Plus, anyone such as Ted Kendall, willing to put his name on the box, indicates that he is proud of the work which went into it.Check it out and decide for yourself."
4,Tuna Press,"Got this style Tuna Press [Jokari Snap On Can Strainer] It snaps on the can; then I can tip it over and let the Tuna drain while I make a toasted cheese sandwich; then open the bread and apply the mayo, tomato and drained Tuna! Yum.Now my Toasted Cheese Tuna Melts sandwiches are Yummy"
1,Doesn't drain tuna,"This strainer doesn't fully drain tuna. It probably works better for solid white tuna, but chunk light really needs to be pressed, and this device is too shallow."
4,"Eminence Omega Pro-18A 18"" Speaker","bought 2 eminence from Beach Audio and finally I got them home here In Belize. I'm building two folded horn for these subs, completed one sub so far and tested it today at low volume and I'm impressed at the response and low pass it throws. Can't wait to fully test 'em both side, will work on the other horn tomorrow.Will update as soon as I have tested both horns fully but the subs are well built and like the response so far.Update: this review was intended for the 8ohms and not the 4ohms as displayed under. anyhow, finally had the time and I've completed both horns and they sound very nice and I am please, its not the hardest but its ok but it's recommended to have 4 bins to really get the that low spl. I would recommend these woofer over the kilomaz with no hesitation."
3,A different Neels story.,I have read a lot of Betty Neels books and out of them all I have to say that this is my least favorite. The heroine of the story spends her time wondering why she agreed to a marriage of convenience to a man who spends the entire book being remote and angry. It had a promising beginning and the ending was mediocre. I was left wondering if the ending was really a happy one or not.
3,Nurse Marries Dutch Doctor,"I'll be upfront here - I'm a fan of Betty Neels. This is not one of her best. Although the plot is fairly standard for Neels, this time she misses infusing that spark into her heroine. Lavinia wonders why a rich Dutch doctor wants to marry a rather non-descript girl like herself, and even the hero seems surprised by it. The reader wonders this also, until finally Radmer comments that she has a gift for serenity.Usually the heroine shows initiative, industriousness, kindness and other qualities that catch the hero's eye even if she lacks glamour and model looks.Worth reading if you are a Betty Neels' fan."
2,Why get married?,Back Cover description: An offer she couldn't refuse...a nursing job in Holland was the only way Lavinia Hawkings could ensure a home and security for herself and her young sister Peta. Yet within weeks of arriving she was married to the devastating Professor Radmer ter Bavinck! Radmer had assured Lavinia that the marriage would be on a friendly basis only--he needed a kind stepmother for his daughter and a competent housekeeper to run his home. It seemed to be the ideal arrangement-- for everyone except Lavinia!The plot was slow. I agree with the reveiwer from Santa Fe that this story could have been better. Do the two main characters even like one another? It's hard to tell. The ending was strange too. Are these two even happy? Not what I consider a good story from this author.
5,SEMI-SEPHARDIC HEAVEN,"This record is new to me, as is most music of this type, from this era. I've a taste for middle-eastern music, both Islamic and otherwise -- including Hindu -- and am wild about most Hungarian and Slavic music. The frankly Sephardic music I've heard I find rapturous and profoundly satisfying. This music of EL SABIO fits into that category, easily, and the musicality of the performers is distinctive in the best way.A new favorite has appeared on my shelves."
1,BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE,"bad customer service its been almost a month and i still have not received this product. ive sent 3 emails and called twice noone really helped me with anything, neither did anyone answer the phones. i dont even know how to rate the item because i dont have it. im pretty sure its really nice its just ive been waiting for almost a month and this is getting frustrating with no help."
4,Lennon Sisters cd,Great cd. Case was cracked when I opened the package but since I need it as a birthday gift right away I have no time to return it but put it in a different case. Other than that happy with product & quick delvery. Thanks.
5,"Once you listen, you are consumed","i was in tower records on sunset blvd in los angeles when i went over to the listening booths to hear new music. there was towa tei's last century modern in magazine one, cd one; however, they were all sold out. not knowing what to think of this mystery cd that everyone seemed to know about but me, i gave it a listen and immediately began to drown into a different world. a world i wondered why i hadnt found before. the music on this album is so easy to listen to, and so warm. its one of those cds you just put on and leave alone, not changing any of the tracks because each track flows together creating a grand picture, not tiny individual ones. i was thrilled to hear Chara, one of my favourite Jpop artists, do vocals on ""let me know"". yet all of the tracks on last century modern are beautifully haunting. this was the first towa tei cd i'd ever bought but since buying this cd, i am hungry for more."
4,i wanna dance!,"towa is the modern day mozart. this album is so freaky fresh that it makes me want to bop forever. if mathematics had music, this would be it."
2,Hit and miss,"I bought this after one of the songs kept coming up on pandora. Unfortunately, only two of the songs really are good. The others are very different and not really to my liking. If you are a big fan of the artist, you'll probably like it. However, the CD is not of a single style. So, be warned. Since you can't preview the songs, it's useful to know."
1,This can't be from Towa Tei .......,"Towa Tei's third effort is met with some disturbing sounds. First, I'm getting pretty tired of him re-doing old songs. At least with last album's Private Eyes, it had completely different music. However, with this one Jamaican Funk is a straight copy. It's a song that I never liked in the first place anyway. The other songs on this CD are mediocre at best except ""Butterfly"". Which is one of two songs I can even stand to listen to. He even messes with Butterfly's beautiful melodies by putting in a terrible bass line which sounds as if it should be in a drum and bass CD. What happened to Mr.Tei's unique ways with ""Future Listening"" and even with ""Sound Museum""? They have appeared to be gone with this effort. Track #6 is a pathetic instrumental full of SILLY noises from what sounds like garbage cans. This my friend is not fun or any sort of a delight to listen to. If you want Towa Tei's best stuff get ""Future Listening"" and stay away from this garbage!"
3,too disjointed,"The problem with all of Towa Tei's releases is they're not very cohesive as a whole. He jumbles too many styles and types of music together ranging from lounge and reggae to dance and drum 'n bass. Not to say that any of his music is bad, it isn't. He's a very talented musician but jumbling too many styles together on one disc makes it a challenge to focus on his skills as a musician. Fortunately with all of his releases there is a handful of stand out gems. On Future Listening they are I Want To Relax, Batucada and Meditation with the lovely Lady Miss Keir on vocals. On Sound Museum we have the ptich perfect German Bold Italic with Kylie Minogue on vocals and with Last Century Modern we the Parisian lounge of the title track, the drum'n bass rhythms of Angel and the pure dance perfection of COngratulations.This is an interesting disc but like another reviewer stated, it does get quickly boring and you'll find that only a few tracks will stand out for you."
2,"Good shield, but I don't like the crank.","I don't actually own this gun, but a friend does and I have used it. It has a nice shield, so if you use it, you don't have to carry around a garbage can lid for protection. It only shoots about 15 feet and the crank doesn't turn smoothly. I don't know if this is typical of all shield blaster 3000s or if it is a one-time defect. Overall, I prefer the pump and trigger system. I recomend this gun to people who want to defend, but not attack."
1,Worst Water Gun Ever,"when i got this gun i thought it was great, but when i used it it gave my hand a rash because of the pump and it didn't shoot far. the best part is that it isn't educational.DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,It breaks !,"The first gun broke, the second gun has no power. I hate it and I bought another water gun, different brand. This brand stinks..."
2,too heavy and the crank aint good,man i wish they had cps's and max-d's again man those were the days the liquidator or an artic shock is good and they could compare to a cps sometimes or in someways
2,meh...,"it isnt very durable, the sheild flips inside out and gets in your way. i guess it teachs u to aim but thats about it. the only reason this doesnt get one star is cuz it can shoot three ways.PS. i couldnt even soak a girl!!! and i usually hit her in the middle of her butt. but she couldn't soak cuz i was too fast and my sheild hit her in the chest and butt."
3,Old wine in new bottle,"If you are a full time DS fan and posses most of their albums, then you should have this collection already with you. If not, the songs featured are great."
1,Beyond atrocity,"My friends and I rented this movie a few years ago. It has become the barometer against which all bad movies are measured.""We saw Alone in the Dark last weekend. It was terrible.""""Federal Hill terrible?""""No, not THAT terrible.""Imagine a mob movie written by junior high students and performed by pre-schoolers and you're still doing a little better than Federal Hill did. The movie is beyond predictable in its dialogue, plot ""twists"" and tough guy talk. You'll cringe and wince at the overacting and poor direction. This is a movie where every line that is supposed to evoke awe from the viewer makes them laugh instead.This one's good for a rental if you and your friends like to tear apart bad movies. Aside from that, AVOID."
4,Excellent,"Playing this Cd really outs you in a good mood for the day. A loud chorus of Dies Irae is performed and really makes you alert of the loud bass signalling the day of judgement. The rest of the CD differs dramatically, you have your soft clarinet pieces, to your loud, proclaiming songs (Jerusalem) This CD is ideal if you want to listen to the different aspects of classical music. I thoroughly endorse it!"
2,"A ""no-comfort"" rating of 2 stars for prolonged use, just a useful information","I looked at the negative reviews and didn't find a single reviewer give it low stars based on comfort. That's why I bought it. I thought my eh 150 sennheiser were bad, these are even worst! And no good sound. Disappointing. Maybe someone will save his money. Again, no comfort, of course over extended use, past 4 hours. These go against ears, no matter that they light, they cause pain. Wanted to give 1 start, but 2 is the lowest of bunch. Maybe more disappointed somebody will. I just want to pass a useful information."
4,Great but one problem,"It was great, sound, bass, and Cord length, but there was one problem. The Headphones were way too big. Like when you put them on, it makes you look like a football head. I would recommend these for when you aren't going anywhere big, because you would just look like a full wherever you go."
2,Not worth it at any price in my opinion,"I'm giving them 2 stars only because they work and were cheap, they LOOK like decent headphones, but they feel like they're filled with hellium, really thin cheap plastic and tiny drivers, these are maybe a hair better than the over the ear phones that came with a walkman in the 90s. If I had realized what I was getting I would have passed."
4,A decent pair of cans for sure,"Firstly, to those of you experiencing problems with these headphones, I would comment that not all headphones roll off the assembly line working the same way as the other 999 units, that's just fact.These are decent, and while they don't deliver as much bass as a pair of skulls or as the other brands suggested, they do still certainly deliver. I found these headphones to be moderately comfortable (although as said in other reviews, keep an eye on your hair).My only complaint is that these headphones do break quite easily (if you're not careful) and I find myself coming back to buy another pair, which isn't a big deal, because their sound is satisfying enough for me."
1,One honest review,"I purchased this product based on reviews on another website that linked to Amazon. Clearly these reviews were purchased. I've gotten better sound quality out of every $20 pair of Walmart headphones I've ever purchased. I was so disappointed when I first tried them on and listed to a song. The treble is too high and sound is muffled overall. I can hear mild feedback when I move the cord. Even my JVC earbuds sound better. As for comfort, I feel immediate pressure from the headband when I put them on. There's no way to comfortably position the headband for me. I would have given the product two stars since there ARE worse sounding $7 headphones on the market, but I believe the blatant misuse of trust by purchasing reviews is inexcusable."
2,only thing good about it is the long cord,"Ugh.Anyone giving it a good review must be listening to MP3s at bitrate of 8k or something.Or they have no experience listening to a Koss or Grado.Even some of the crappy Plantronics and Sennheiser are better.I am comparing it to a similar priced Koss Porta Pro.Both are made in china. what isnt?But the sound quality is night and day.The packaging for the HA shows that frequency response is 7-21k. Hah!Thats why I picked it off the shelf, but shame on JVC. Lies! All lies! NFW!Get yourself a Koss Porta Pro and enjoy the sound and the crappy styling."
4,Good quality headphones,"I bought these headphones for listening at work. The ear muffs are a little small but the whole headphone is very light and comfortable. I wear glasses but my ears don't hurt even after 1+ hrs of use. I wish the Bass was a little better but, for the price, the overall sound quality is pretty good."
2,Horrible build causes creaking and rattling noise,"The audio quality is ok. Nothing great. For the price, the audio quality would have been acceptable but the build quality is terrible. Moving your jaws (like when eating) or head makes the cups creak in the hinges and there is a bad rattling noise and it is so bad that sometimes you cannot audio over this noise. Stay away from these headphones."
5,its great!,"these are great.the bass is not too much or too low just right.these are also pretty tough headphones,they were crushed and still appear in great shape"
2,Ive read three of his books and I dont know why.,I am a avid reader of alternate history. Mr. Cotterell always picks good topics such as the one in this book or the terra cota warriors but digress's to the same topic. What is this same topic you say? It is his idea of some superscience and super-gods. No not just regular gods super gods who 999 represent because 999 is 666 upside down?OK now you understand???Then in every book he has to get into his theorys of life and reproduction as being evil blah blah please stick to the topic. I do not buy history to be force feed religion for no reason. I respect this man in one aspect he seems to be great with mathmatics. But on the other hand he's one of those people who if you divid this by 4 x 360 +2x the sacered Phi +15 you come to the number of the super god? I am not big into math but it seems to me you can come to any number if you do enough calculations?
1,Shipped to wrong address!,I NEVER received this order and it was a Christmas Gift for my grandson. It was shipped to the WRONG address and I have received NO response from the seller!
2,Incomprehensible to an Indian mythology neophyte,"Having read and loved Calasso's ""The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmonia"", I grabbed this book the moment I saw it in a bookshop. I guess I should have known it would not be an easy book to read - after all, if I did not already have a solid background in Greek mythology before I read ""The Marriage"", I would have found it incomprehensible too. This is NOT the first book about Indian mythology to read, and perhaps not even the second or third book - you will be utterly confused unless you already have a very good foundation in Indian mythology AND some knowledge of Indian sacred writings. I was thoroughly disappointed, but perhaps that was my own fault for picking a book that went way over my head."
3,Some knowledge required,It certainly helps having some background knowledge of hindu mythology before picking this book up (same goes for greek mythology and the Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony). In certain sections Calasso weaves a beautiful space whilst in others I found the tone and flow somewhat disjointed and difficult to immerse in. It would have helped to have a more complex glossary.
2,difficult,"Having enjoyed ""The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony"", and wanting to learn something about Hindu mythology, I was really excited to get my copy of ""KA"". Unfortunately, I still don't know much about Hindu Mythology. ""KA"" is difficult. Perhaps if I'd started with some knowledge of the subject (as was the case for the Greek myths of ""Marriage..."") I would have been able to get something out of the book - but it's certainly not appropriate for absolute beginners in Hindu mythology. I read about half of it, and absorbed nothing."
4,Ka : Stories of the Mind and Gods of India (Vintage International),"Roberto Calasso delves into the mythos of Ancient India. Ka provides the reader with a very rich and detailed, yet readable, account of creation, the gods, and rituals of India. This book is recommended for anyone interested in studying Eastern philosophy, Roberto Calasso, and critical enquiry."
1,Deceptive advertising: Buyer beware!,"This seller continues to display his product here and on eBay with a totally incorrect and misleading name.The Shofar may be referred to in some circles as a Biblical trumpet, but anyone with an education in music knows this is NOT a ""Natural Trumpet."" This product isn't even ""natural"" - - It's made of PLASTIC! [Resin]A Natural Trumpet is made of brass, usually about seven feet in length folded twice. A Natural Trumpet uses an exponentially shaped brass bell and sound is produced by lips vibrating in a cupped mouthpiece of a very specific design [usually a flat rim, hemispheric bowl, no rounding of the shoulder into the shank, etc.].Virtually ANYONE searching for a legitimate Natural Trumpet will get a laugh out of this sellers ignorant misuse of the term."
1,Old Product,This product was discontinued at least 5 years ago. Be aware if you purchase this product that it is old and that MK will not honor the 100% guarantee.
4,From problems to profits,"Its a must have book if you are planning to open a grooming business, or if you already do, its good to read it."
2,disappointing,I was very anxious to receive this book. It is solely based on the premis that groomers are too expensive if they are to be paid 50% commission...not very realistic.
2,Useless for House Call or Mobile Grooming,"I was recommended this book by grooming board but I found it totally useless for the mobile groomer or house call groomer. The book called ""Notes from the Grooming Table"" is a much better investment for the groomer in general."
2,An anticlimactic end,"That is, to the excitement that I had prior to listening to this CD. I had honestly never heard this group before. They came up in my amazon recommendations and I, being a Celtic, Folk & ProgRock fan, took the plunge. I don't know what I was expecting, but I thought it would be something on the order of when I first heard Mary Fahl & Marina Belica of the October Project or maybe more Celtic flavored like Nightnoise. Unfortunately it was nothing, qualitatively, like either of those experiences. I will have to say that just when I thought it was going to be a total loss they do successfully go to some traditional fiddling with ""Shindig."" But it's too little too late. Winter Mountain needed to rock harder,(someone should have ditched the synthesizer at the nearest cliff) Pieces of Love had a few missing and though I wanted to like this disc The Gap (was) Too Wide."
2,Not worth it!,"It was awful. I still have the CD, but I doubt if I'll ever play it again. Don't waste your money!"
3,Hard to hold,"This is a very small mortar with high walls. It is a perfect size for grinding pills. Unfortunately, while the pestle is probably proportional to the mortar, it is too short to work with. It isn't long enough to be comfortably grasped by the pole, so you are forced to rest the brunt in your palm. Your grinding action then digs into the palm. I found this to be painful. If you really need the mortar size and you have a pestle from a larger set, this is not a bad purchase."
4,"Good value, not so good for grinding small seeds.","This is a fine product, sturdy and functional as advertised. I wanted to grind flax seeds with it, and it's not quite the right tool... and I'm still not sure what the right tool is."
3,"Pretty, but not heavy enough for many tasks","Wish I had splurged and gotten a bigger, heavier model. Didn't have a lot of storage space, so thought this would be fine, but I really need something with more heft. Good product for the casual cook, though."
3,Depens on what you use it for,"I bought this product to make a small batch of pesto. I was told when you grind basil the flavor is much better.I almost killed myself making it. You probably should only buy this product if you are looking for crushing some small grains, herbs, pills, etc.PROS:Non Porous Material (did slightly stain from basil leaves)Mortar and Pestle have ruff surfaces for grindingSimple Classic LookCONS:Pestle is small and hard to hold for a long period of timeFragile (it dropped about one foot from my hands to the Formica counter and it shattered)Bowl is VERY smallBasically for basic needs like herb and pill crushing, this should be fine. If you are looking to use it for long periods of time or crush large quantities of materials - look elsewhere."
3,It's ok.,"I knew it I was ordering very small sized item but knew only after I use it that its not deep enough to keep the stuff safe from jumping out when using it. So I have to be very careful if I am trying to crush like tiny mustard seeds etc as it jumps out. The quality is nice, I wish they made it more deeper."
5,great little mortar and pestle,"into collecting white ceramic and/or porcelain kitchen helpers; this one is a great size for peppercorns, cloves, whatever. I do really enjoy having this."
5,Smart design,Octagon sided outer surface aids grip. Grinds food items to fine powder. Does a geat job and is a handy size.
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"This book is so useless! It shows you all the cool things you can do with these programs, but it doesn't teach you how. No wonder they called it ""Studio Secrets."" How they made these graphics were kept a secret."
3,"good sound, poor packaging","This CD has impressive sound. I find however that as a music lover, the packaging is severly lacking. There are absolutely no notes that come with this CD. For instance the allegretto from symphony no 7 is truncated, but there is nothing indicating that it is the case, or why. I think for the price, the company should have been more serious. Clearly this CD is more about being a showcase for DTS and a 5.1 surround system - where it succeeds - than it is about satisfying music lovers, where I think it fails."
1,Lacking in melodic harmony,I was very disapointed with the presantation of the CD cover and the lack of melodic harmony. So much for cultural diversity.
5,Wonderful CD,I love and my 11 month old loves this CD. I bought it so that I could remember all of the songs that I heard as a child. The lyrics are easily understood and the music is beautiful and soothing. I highly recommend this CD.
5,Favorite Nursery Rhymes - Baby Genius,My 4 month old just loves the music on this CD. Whenever she hears it she listens intently and gets all excited. If she's fussy this CD immediately quiets her down. I believe she like the sounds of the instruments played in the music and the tempo of the songs. I highly recommend it for any baby.
5,a dream instrument,"One evening using this instrument was enough to convince me that I made the right decision. If you find that you are attracted to Dave Smith Instruments, I would recommend obtaining one directly. You will probably save yourself in the long run.For example, my instrument survived obvious and egregious rough handling during shipping, but it works just fine. The Evolver is an example of thoughtful engineering, as well as a great instrument. It fulfills all the capacities of many lesser synths. Take my advice.

3,Fun!!!,This book is a fun read. I love doing quizzes over and over again. I am pleased with this book.
3,Its good for slumber parties.....sometimes....,"I got this book because I have slumber parties a lot. Well Its fun, but a lot of the quizzes are the same and it gets old after a while. Once you have taken the quiz and all your friends have too it's pointless. We got bored with it really easy."
4,Instrumental Jam,"FYI: This is an instrumental CD performed by Corben Cassavette. Pretty good. If you are looking for a new twist on some old favorites this will do it. Very cool CD. Why 4 stars and not 5? Easy, its not Clapton."
2,Huge fan of Donna Leon,I'm a huge fan of Donna Leon and have read most of her Comissarrio Brunetti novels. I ordered this video from Amazon Prime and was very disappointed with the acting and quality of the production.
1,not worth the money,"For what I paid, I was seriously expecting an industrial-strength access point with a solid range. I have used other 3Com access points such as the 8250 in larger environments with desired results, but this one doesn't measure up AT ALL. I mounted it centrally about 7 feet up a wall, tried different antennas, different physical locations, different software settings, firmware upgrades, etc, but my cheap crappy netgear consumer wireless router gets better range, and from farther away will generate a better signal than this 3Com.Sorely disappointed."
1,Hate it,"This thing is a piece of crap it leaked oil everywhere, the salt & pepper shakers were weird and I ended up throwing it out."
3,The Forsythes,"As I am only 5% into the story it is hard to give much of a review. The characters are quite defined, the pace leisurely. I'll have a better handle when I have gone further into the book"
4,Helpful text for media students or enthusiastic generalists,"This text offers a comprehensive overview for students of the media or anyone interested in learning about media theory. I'm a masters student (in media) at the London School of Economics and have just read the book to prepare for my exams. Some of the reading is rather dense, but it is rewarding if you take the time. The essayists in the book are leading scholars in media studies. The essays on globalization,cultural imperialism, the public sphere and the Internet are particularly interesting."
3,Very smart....,"Well, obviously we know that J-Lo is a smart business lady. She has the best of both worlds. Even though she is still very hot and is very much capable of competing with the Best, she is aware that the younger talent and generation is right behind her. The American audience appreciates J-Lo's sense of style and the excitement she brings to the stage when she entertains and does her thing on stage. She is an international star. The Latino community and European community will embrace her and love her forever - no doubt about that. Now to the nitty gritty. Vocally we know she is not a Christina, but I like the way she is able to flip it. English/Spanish it doesn't make a difference. Jennifer you are a FLY-GYRL and always will be. Keep on doin' your thang! Her longevity is in her roots."
3,1 hit song,"there is only 1 hit, the others are tolerable. spanish is good, but her voice is a little shakey on ballads"
5,Nice & Easy Listening,"I do enjoy this album. It would be even better if my Spanish language skills were 100%!! My favorite songs are Tu, Sola, & even the standard Adios, but I do enjoy every one of the songs. I don't feel the need to skip any of them when I am listening. It does not disappoint."
1,Jennifer's downfall..........,"Jennifer Lopez is to me the most fashionable, best dressed celebrity in Hollywood. And all of her movies are great, SHE'S A GREAT ACTRESS, AND SINGER!!!! But even though I dont know Spanish that well I can still tell whether an album is good or bad. And this is BAD. I thing the first single ""Que Hiciste"", is terrible. It is very weird sounding, plus the video is a lackluster. But I wish that she would have came out with more songs off her earlier album ""Rebirth""."
1,Que?,Jennifer Lopez back with a new album. She's trying something new and is singing in Spanish. I am suprised at how well this album is produced and everything but Jennifer's voice is still weak. She can't sing and she should stick to acting.
1,OH JESUS!,"This woman is brave! Brave for continuing doing something she can't clearly do. SING. In here, she tries to reach the audience she left so far behind, the latin audience. I give her credit for her efforts, or who ever was behind this. If you want to buy a good product from a real singer who has never left his people in the dust, buy Marc Anthony, Jennifer Lopez's 10th husband. He can really SING and has real talent.Jennifer, dear, go home, cook or clean, stay all day looking in the mirror or something."
5,best ever from jennifer lopez,"I can hardly wait for the next all spanish cd from jennifer lopez - she could be the female luis miguel! it is just beautiful - especially ""tu"" and ""por arriesgarnos"". what took her so long to do this?"
3,Good album,Overall I would say this is a good album. Her songs evoke a lot of emotion and the lyrics are good. The only problem is that jennifer's Spanish is a little strange. I speak spanish (not perfect by any means) and when I listen to the cd I can tell that she sings mostly from memorization. She doesnt seem to feel the words as opposed to singing them because she memorized them. There is a halting quality to her words and she doesnt stress them the way that somebody else would.
5,Great Ear tip for IEM from SHURE - - - Works Like Magic !,This Shure ear tip can replace ear tip of many IEM (In Ear Monitor) in the market.It works like magic !!!This Shure PA757M can improve sound of many IEM from other brand.I tried it on Panasonic RP-HJE50 and it make this IEM sound fuller and bass also improved.On Philips SHE-9500 (modified by closing all bass tubes to reduce artificial bass) it become better balanced.For Creative ep630 (Sharp MD 33/ Sennheiser IE4 (cx300) ) no real improvement but the sound stage become wider so it is more pleasure for prolong listening.If 9 - 10 bucks is not a problem you should give it a try.
3,If you think you have the patience then try to watch this,"Texhnolyze is really really weird at first, especially since most of the first episode is in complete silence. Silence is ok but when even the visual leads you nowhere it starts to get at your nerves. The animation is excellent but the story is lacking a bit. The good thing with this is that the first and second episode are the ones that would make you turn it off but the remaining ones get you interested. If you can't wait this out then I can't blame you the beginning is boring as hell but it's almost worth the wait when you get deeper into the story."
2,Undependable,"I have to comment on this book because it's not reliable anymore.I enjoyed the array of hikes that the editors chose, but it looks like they just translated some out of date Japanese books. Some of the trails in this book have been long closed and you will find yourself confused at night in the mountains if you attempt them. For example, the suggested descent from Aka-dake hasn't been maintained since an earthquake at least five years ago.On the other hand, the book covers a fantastic variety of paths and makes it easy to find what you want. If you want to try a hike in this book, make certain you get current info on the state of the path as well as lodging along the way. This means call yourself, and ask specific questions.But really, you're better off just getting a good Japanese book."
2,You'd Think They Would Try to Update a New Edition,"I was looking forward to the updated edition for some time but when I picked it up today I was very disappointed to see that very little was changed from the last edition. Most troubling was that information which was long out of date was still included in the guide. For example, the Kumotori hike which is described in the Tokyo section recommends taking a cable car up to the starting point for the hike. Unfortunately, the cable car stopped running several years ago and so anyone following this guide book will have a much longer hike on their hands than the one they may have planned (an extra 800 meters of climbing to get where the actual hike in the guide book begins). It is a useful book for those new to Japan but I am very disappointed that LP did not make the effort to make sure the information in this new edition was still accurate."
3,"Informative, but not so helpful","This book was very informative to me, but I think the research is a little old. While it helped me learn more about the disorder, the programs it suggested didn't help regulate me."
5,I would recommend this book to anyone suffering with PCOS!,I FINALLY understand what is going on with my body now that I have read this book and recommend all who even question if they have PCOS to read it whether they are trying to conceive or not. It is an EXTREMLY easy read and I found myself almost finishing the book in one night! I did not feel that this was written from one doctor to another but for REAL WOMEN who battle PCOS everyday.
4,Excellent and informative,"This book really helped me learn about PCOS. I bought some others too, but Colette Harris is the best. IF you can get to grips with our PCOS the natural way, do it! Read this book!"
4,good read,"This book was a good read for me. It gave me ideas of what to do in order to increase my fertility. Lucky for me, I didn't have to follow the book fully as I got pregnant a month after purchasing it. I will read it again prior to trying for number two."
3,The title explains it all,it is hard to review these types of books...it explained PCOS in many many ways only a few i could relate to.
2,No Real Medical Backing,I am an RN and I could not even finish this book. I found the suggestions and advice absurd and not applicable to every day life. What bothered me the most is that the author seems against anything medical. I am not sure where or how she gets her research. I would not recommend this book.
5,Good Gospel Music,"My family and I really enjoy this CD. Good,down to earth gospel music. Great groups. Anyone would enjoy it."
4,southern gospel's top 20 songs,I love Southern Gospel and this CD is so good that I gave my last one to my son and ordered another one for me.If you enjoy Southern Gospel you will love this one for sure.
2,"Dumb readers like me need complete before/after source, not snippet","A number of times I thought I understand the refactoring after I read the summary at the beginning of each section, as well as the benefit and liabilities.However, I got myself into trouble when I started reading the source codes. Code snippet worked in certain occasions, but failed in others.The author could help readers like me if he could provide complete copies of source codes before after the refactoring on a CD or a web site."
3,Refactoring to Patterns,"The book is good in terms of how it is organised and the topics that it covers.However, the choice of the type of examples used are poor. I recommend that the entire listing of the code before refactoring and after refactoring should be provided along with each chapter. Often I got lost while walking through the code snippets, as the steps that the author is walking through does not necessarily match the way I would walk through the code while refactoring using patterns. Sometimes it is hard to predict why the author did what he did, although it is just an intermediate step to to reach the ultimate goal. Some of the code snippets does not match the class diagrams and caused added confusion."
3,"Nice book, but...","The lack of full source code makes it hard to see the big picture of what the author is trying to convey. It doesn't even have a CD nor a link to a page where you can try and download the snippets he has in the book. These drawbacks prompted me to rate this book to 3 stars, though it could have been better had he provided those resources that could reinforce the concepts, and of course for me to test them."
5,Very good book,"Refactoring written by Martin Fowler is the foundamental book, and this Refactoring to Patterns is higher level talking about refactoring. This is an excellent book about the refactoring."
2,"A must-have book for software developers, but...","This is a very good reference/utility book for any software designer, developer, maintainer... Unlike the traditional design pattern books, which talk about how to apply various design patterns under various situations, this book focus more on how to find badly designed and implemented code and apply simple yet effective patterns to make the existing code better. The author starts with listing some common problems in the existing code, such as conditonal complexity, long method, etc. He goes on by suggesting some possible solutions to the problems, such as using a strategy pattern to reduce conditional complexity, etc. He uses some very good examples and shows the detail steps involving in the refactoring process.This book deserves ""*****"" if the complete source code before and after refactoring is available. Without the complete source code, it takes much more time and effort in trying to understand what is involved in the refactoring process."
3,Valuable Information But Hard To Follow,"I agree with the reviewers who complain about the lack of full source code (either in the book or on the Web for me to download), as a C# programmer I found it very difficult to follow the changes he was making from the small densely packed Java snippets.Thats not to say I wouldn't recommend people to buy/read this book as its a decent book with lots of useful information and I really hope that any future editions improve on the quality."
4,Nice hat but.........,"I`ve had nothing but great comments from my friends since I received the hat. The only problem is that it`s too large. The information about sizing states that it fits 7 1/8.. I wear it as long as there is little wind. Also, the inside band goes only around the front inside of hat. But still worth the money."
5,Keeps my bald head protected & cool!!,I had been looking locally for a hat like this for several months. I wear a 7 3/4 size hat and was unsure if the XL would fit. It did and the hat is very comfortable and allows a nice breeze through the openings. It is very well made and hopefully will last a while.
5,My husband loves this hat!d,"I bought this hat because it was inexpensive and looked fashionable in its picture. My husband likes the broad, gently curved brim. When I gave it to him for Father's Day, he said ""I wanted a straw hat, but I wasn't expecting such a nice one!"" It looks just as good as the picture, the size was true, and it does its job--keeping the summer Texas Sun at bay."
5,Great!!!,Although I didn't find difinative answers to my belt or link ? The history of the link vs belt in 1917 was very informative and pointed me in the right direction.
1,Repetición&#65533;Repetición&#65533;Repetición&#65533;etc&#65533;,"La verdad es que la música de Steve Reich, es de lo más aburrida y poco creativa que uno se pueda imaginar. Al margen de alguna que otra idea bien realizada, el resto del disco es decepcionante.Un disco para obviar."
1,Interesting and almost captivating...,"until I read the part that said the Imperial Family spoke German quite often, that Alexandra was basically a whining female doh (ahem), and that Alexei was a little brat who one would want to smack across the face. These ""American telegrams"" that are ""the dramatic new evidence"" is all a bunch of crock--anyone who has studied the Imperial Family as people in-depth can figure that out easily."
4,Just what I needed.,My son's truck needed a new bumper. Best price I could find was on Amazon and with free shipping this made it an even sweeter deal. Only negative I found is the bumper doesn't come with a pre-drilled hole for the spare tire tool to go thru to lower the tire in case of a flat.
1,"Don't get it, not worth it....","This silicone skin is very thin, slides on easy...however, it smells awful, rancid/burning nasty chemical smell and I wondered what toxic dump it came from (made in China - so sorry for what American consumerism is doing to China). The stink was enough for me to immediately remove it, bag it and forget it!Also, the skin does not fit the K1m (KRZR) unless you cut off a ""strap"" that appears to help hold it on the phone (covers the camera/menu/clr buttons - pretty important buttons to have visible)...save your $10 ($6 plus shiping) and get something else..."
1,Item never came.,"The item was ordered and I waited a long time for it's arrival and was finally told it was on back order,but it still didn't arrive.I contacted Amazon about it and they made sure my money was refunded."
5,Heart of healing,This CD is a fun feel good music that I recommend to clients & friends especially if going through a difficult or challangeing time.
5,amazing!,"This woman is an amazing talent! Truly music for your soul, this amazing talent will be on my music shelf from now on!"
3,Rehash of film photography,"This book purported to be about digital photography yet it read like a film photography book with the occasional reference to Photoshop to make it 'digital'.I was particularly disappointed in the star photography section. He implies that you can leave the shutter open for hours, like in the film days. Anyone who has tried long-exposure photography knows that the sensor heats up after thirty minutes, leaving red edges in the shot. (For great star trails information, google Moose Petersen and 'star trails'. Now HE knows!). So, as far as I'm concerned, he never even tried that chapter with a digital camera. I wonder where else he skimped?Pretty pictures, but I'm disappointed overall."
1,wrong item,"They sent me blue polka-dot ribbon, clearly marked as khaki thread, but pretty much as far from khaki thread as you could get and still be in the sewing department."
3,"Interesting, but...","Everyone told me I'd like this Mallory series since I was a fan of the Lisbeth Salander series, but I just couldn't get into it. I found the characters distant and unappealing, and the sub-plots seemed like rather pointless overwritten space-fillers. I wanted to like it, but it was a real chore to get through. Not for me, I guess."
5,"Brilliant, cutting edge; Mallory's world is a masterpiece!","Caroll O'Connell's writings are works of art! Beautifully rendered characters complete with physical descriptions, pasts, futures, and real personalities make the stories come to life. The lethal beauty of Mallory, the chivalrous genius Charles, gruff, slobby Riker, stressed out Coffey, maternal Helen, and Markowitz the dancing fool all enhance this book's power. Detouring from the beaten track, Carol O'Connell writes mystery like no one else! READ THIS BOOK."
3,I love Mallory...,"but this one is too tangled for me. Jumping around among a large number of principals, it gets a bit scattered for my enjoyment.(Perhaps it's just that I've got a bad cold & can't concentrate.) O'Connell gave us a brilliant debut in ""Oracle"" and regained her footing in ""Stone Angel."" ""Crime School"" and a couple of others also outshine this one, so I shan't give up the series."
4,British edition,"FYI, this is the British edition of The Man Who Cast Two Shadows, the second Mallory book."
2,A crude anti-abortion subtext,"The plot of this Kathleen Mallory novel is all well and good, and Mallory is a very interesting character, and getting more interesting with each book. It's the subplot that rankles. There are numerous crude and annoying references to the abortion that one of the characters has, and they all include phrases such as ""how could she cut her baby out of her body"". Please. Enough.Not recommended because of this."
4,OK for price,"Pluses: inexpensive relatively ... easy to set timing ... seems reliableMinuses ... sound too squeaky if any hearing impairmentUse.. 4 monthsCaution... if you leave room without it, it won't be useful. Low battery difficult to see but light stop working. Batteries that come with it relatively short lived. Timing will work even if battery low."
4,Trustworthy,"good timer, especially for taking an exam where the examiners only allow you to bring a silent timer. you can study with the beeping function & easily turn it off for the exam, as well as have the convenience of trying both the count-down & stop-watch functions to determine which you prefer on exam day. only negative comments - the magnet was held by cheap glue & fell off; & after i dropped it, it is no longer silent - But, i've regularly used it for a year and I'm buying a new one today, so as to be sure to have it for my big 3-day exam - the kind of exam that could make you or break you."
2,Shake Awake Timer,"The write up on this sounded too good to be true, and it was; very inexpensive but poorly made. The start/stop rocker switch sticks in the start mode, and the time hangs up until you wiggle the switch. The visual alarm does not work on it's own like advertised; it only works when either vibrate or audio portion is enabled.I would not recommend this for meditation practice which is what I use it for; hopefully I can find a better vibrating timer.1dharmabum"
3,DVD-R From VHS,"The copy I purchased from ""sterlingmw"" is a DVD-R, ""manufactured"" by Congress Entertainment. It looks like it came from a VHS tape and is middling quality, with no menu or extras. However, I enjoyed this movie as a child when it was released in 1961, and it is great to see it again. It is too bad the story and characters were changed for American audiences (see other reviews). I recall that is was rather popular at the time. Since American audiences are more sophisticated these days, it would nice to see the original Japanese movie released."
3,alakazam the great,Interesting project. The film seemed above average. Music and artwork seemed exceptioal. This copy seems rather faded.
2,No Widescreen Treatment,"It's a pity there is no widescreen print of this wonderful children's classic. (unless you are lucky enough to own the laser-disc) Avoid the Movies Unlimited print at all costs as it's just awful!! It looks like a VHS copy of a copy. I have not seen this particular print but I presume it's pan and scan as well. As far as the plot goes its great fun with music and magic, monkeys and mayhem, cannibals and Kings. Wonderfully narrated by Sterling Holloway , who also voiced Winnie the Pooh."
2,Sing-A-Long,We did not care for this one because we did not want to hear the children's voices while my daughter was trying to sing. More like a sing-long that a karaoke.
2,Poor audio; where's Damita Jo?,"I understand that post-WW2 independent labels used, shall we say, slightly substandard pressing materials; however, that is no excuse for the truly poor sound ""restoration"" that has been done (or not) to the tracks on this reissue, some of which provide a painful listening experience. ""Featuring Damita Jo"" is misleading since she only appears on backing vocals on a handful of tracks - none of her significant solo vocals with the group are included. To top it off, one of the two discs in this set was defective, with annoying static. All in all, a poor reissue."
2,"Great music, defective pressing","Great music, good selection of tunes by this L.A. classic vocal group. Unfortunately, a considerable portion of one of the CDs is defective (heard this on multiple copies of the same disc, so it's a production problem), resulting in an annoying static. Hope they fix the problem in a later production run."
1,Too Bad You Can't Cook With It,After exchanging my GasWatch Model TVL-204 three times I gave up. Each time I verified for leaks in the system and each time when I attempted to light the grill it immediately shut the gas off. The last time it was installed by the Dealer at my home with the same results. Perhaps the newer model 205 works better.
4,Propane tank indicator,It worked great after I gave it to my daughter. It will not work on the snap on type tanks. Should be noted in description.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!,"It is sad to say but the days of a solid American made product is dead! The smokers made by Char Griller boast that they are American made, and covered by a warranty...then in the small print it says 'the paint may peel off your smoker upon first use (it should say WILL peel off upon first use!), the paint is not covered by the warranty.' if you are unfortunate enough to own one of these then you know what I am talking about, both my grill and side smoker are all but devoid of paint. I called Char Griller and told them that I was appalled by their underhandedness, they didn't seem to care. well the best (or worst) advertising is word of mouth. and I have nothing good to say about this product!"
2,Why can't I buy an American-made barbecue?,"I bought one of these 7 years ago and it finally died (the bottom rusted out) last weekend. Imagine my disgust when I went out to buy another that, not only had the price gone up 40% but they are now made in China (maybe my original one was, too). Anyway, as I don't want to run the risk of eating food that has been cooked over lead and barium (not that I know for a fact that this barbecue has either of those in), I had to buy a Weber which appears to be the only American-made barbecue available, despite the abundance of barbecues called ""American this"" and Texan that"". The Weber cooks better than my old grill did and is also airtight which means I can save charcoal by closing the vents and having the fire go out."
3,disappointing customer no service,"grill arrived box all smashed, parts missing, parts broke, called company asked for missing parts and replacement for wood rack that was broke, was willing to deal with the fact that cover was all scraped up. Grill was put together already, they said unasemble grill and send back. All I asked for was missing parts and a new board to go on the shelf. NO GO. NO Call back either. Buyer beware.Not a very pretty Christmas present."
4,SHIPPING,THE GRILL ITS SELF IS A STURDY GRILL AND EASY TO PUT TOGETHER THE DOWN FALL IS THE SHIPPING.THE HOOD OF THE GRILL WAS DELIVERED WITH THE CENTER PUSHED IN.YOU WILL PROBALY HAVE TO BANG SOMETHING OUT.
5,One Year Later - Amazing Grill,"I bought this a year ago for a big 4th of July cook out in our new house. Grilled 2 whole chickens, 5 pounds of steak and bacon on the lower bit and grilled corn on the cob on the top rack. It takes a full bag of charcoal to cover the entire floor of the grill but you can just use as much as you want and cook on a small part of it for two people. Only fill up the whole grill if you are cooking for 10+ people.Unit arrived perfectly. Assembly was easy. Curing and cleaning is great. Easy to clean if you take care of it. I've used it ONLY for grilling (not smoking) and it's an exceptional product. The price is perfect, too."
2,Functional,"Packaging is awful, I would not take the chance of having this shipped again. It's good as a grill, but if you plan to smoke meat in it with the optional firebox, be aware that the sealing is poor and a lot of heat escapes making it difficult to maintain steady temperature. There are similar grills in all local stores that are of the same/better quality in local stores. It's just too much of a hassle and expense to take it back apart and send it.If I had to do it over, I'd go with something else."
5,best grill ever,"This grill is the best grill I have ever used. It gets hot fast and burns hotter than any other grill I have ever used. Cooking on this grill is amazing! Its extra large surface cooks enough to feed twenty all at once, or it can be used for two as well. It is a snap to keep clean, and the multi use smoker attachment is a parfect compliment. I will never use another grill again. This is a must own!"
5,Nice size,"This the best grill ever to have to cook about 3 or 4 slab of ribs. It really take two people to part it together, but I did it by myself. ;-) The drums of the grill makes the package very heavy, you would need a dolly. If you do order this product, be sure to look it over before parting it together. I had the grill return because, one of the drum at the corner was a little deattach. I wasn't taking any chances."
3,nice grill,The instructions to this grill were so poorly done it tells you to use bolts that they don't even give you or list in what's included. The nameplate was riveted on upside down which looks really stupid and I had to pound the grill back into shape after it was finally assembled because it was poorly handled and bent up so the grates wouldn't stay on the grill. Overall I would not buy this online if I could do it over. Once I finally got done with assembly and repair it is a great grill and I like it a lot
2,French Fry Cutter,You must have a wide mouth food processor to use this item. Otherwise your french fries will be very short and they won't resemble french fries at all. I have tried the disc on both types of food processors and I have found it may even be best to hand cut the potatos.
3,Kitchen aid slicer,i had all the slicing tools for my kitchen aid except this one . I wanted to make oven fries as I am trying to watch my weight....Making french fires with this slicer is a breeze and the potatoes are cut uniformly and therefore they cook all at the same time...They are scrumptious to eat!
3,"Predictable, But Good Chick Lit All the Same","Hot Stuff is the first in a trilogy about the Jordan sisters. Hot Stuff focuses on Annabelle who is the oldest of the three. The book itself isn't very deep but does deal with deep themes such as people with disabilities, trust, and abandonment issues. It's cute typical chick lit and is a solid story about two people, who both have issues with trust, finding the courage to let their guard down."
3,first of a series,"This book is the first of a series of four. It was interesting, held my attention I looked forward to reading next chapter. I will probably continue reading the rest of the series."
4,First time reader.,"This was the first Carly Phillips book I've read (that I can remember). I found this story to be very interesting, and actually I found her Uncle Yank to be the most interesting character in the book. I had a lot of empathy for the man as he was losing his eyesight, and not wanting to tell anyone. It tickled me when his long time assistant/secretary (Lola)changed everything about herself, including cavorting with his competitor to get Yank's attention.I enjoyed the book to the point that I'll be one of the first in line for the next in this trilogy. Good work, Ms. Phillips."
