1,DANGER! DEFECT CAUSED INJURY!,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! Due to a defective weld, my puppy IMPALED A PAW on one of the vertical wires. She started screaming because 3 inches of the 6 inch wire was protruding from her paw. My husband rushed home and used heavy duty wire cutters to cut the other end of the wire off the cage, and then pulled the remaining wire out of her paw. Had I not been home when it happened, she would likely have lost some or all of her paw."
5,Can't beat the price,"I've bought similar crates in the past for double the price and the quality is the same. It's easy to setup, breakdown, and is very portable. I'll never buy a crate at a retail store again as long as this is available!"
5,Divided dog crate,"The best part of this crate besides the quality was the fact it comes with a divider, which is really important when training a puppy. After 2 weeks of use we have the best behaved puppy (housebroken, that is)."
2,just ok...,Box was tore up thru shipment. Crate does not properly align on sides. Sides bow in opposed to lining up to keep a secure corner. Perfect size for our dog tho.
4,Surprised!,"Thank God my dog is small (13lbs). I bought this as a second crate to have our family room because my dog sleeps in the basement in a larger crate where she is free to sleep and use the paper when needed. I did not realized the crate would be as small as it is and there is not a lot of turnaound room in it. At any rate, it was easy to assembly and durable. I will keep it!"
2,product description not very specific!,"Not an accurate size reference on the site. The depiction of a lab in all the different size crates as they have can be an epic failure when it comes to ordering this. I went off their reference thinking the smaller size, if it can fit a puppy lab or terrier it can fit my jack Russell. No it does not!!! The smallest size they have is way too small. My jack is 1yr and is as big as he will get. He can fit in the crate but there is no space in there for him to make a 360 degree turn around. This would be a perfect size crate for training and using as a time out for your dog, which I will use it for instead of wasting time shipping it back.Of course I should have measured first. But who has a tape measure immediately at their disposal? I sure didn't. And I was trusting the picture depiction as a reference in buying this which was no good!"
4,Does the job,"Very easy to set up. easy to open and close, and does the job. Started to come a little loose and I don't know why, but my husband fixed that. it's getting too small for our dog, so we'll have to order a bigger one :-/Fast forward 4 months later: we got the 42""L and it is huge! Way bigger than what I thought it was going to be, and I'm happy about that. We have a Belgian Malinois/Lab mix, so he's going to be big. He needs this cage because he is not completely potty trained and likes to get into the trash and drink toilet water. Ew. LOL."
4,Good product,I'm very happy w/this crate. It's very easy to put up and take down. The removable bottom pan is great and easy to clean. I'd buy this product again.
5,Excellent product,"Not only was assembly easy, but the crate looks wonderful. Our Labrador loves it and hassles his big brother before running to it's safety. It cleans easily and is very light for the size. The door is easy to open and close. It is wonderful that he can see through the kennel so he doesn't feel blocked off from everything."
5,Very happy with purchase!,"This crate was everything I wanted. It was exactly how they described it online, and it is made with very high quality. My dog loves her new apartment!"
2,"The first couple of pages are good, the rest is rather bland","The author shares his haughty opinions on the following:1. How the Alaskan wilderness is dying off.2. How the US government and oil companies are such evil monsters.3. How to disobey authority in any given place, especially ecologically-threatened places.4. How to live in your own little unrealistic world and write a book about it."
1,Total Waste of Money,"I have purchased Body Toolz individually packaged before. I thought these would be the same quality. These are not even close. The quality is extrememly poor. It feels like these tools are just stamped with the name brand. The clippers just broke my nails off, leaving sharp crooked edges that needed to be filed. A great amount of hand strength was required just to clip the nails and the results were very poor. I would not have paid a dollar for this set. Truly a disappointment. I really wanted to like this set."
4,Great Gift,Bought this for teenage boy's gift. He liked it. Need I say more? The tools seem to be a decent quality. It should last him a long time.
3,Manicure Set,It's nice having the tools in the zippered case. The quality of the tools wasn't as good as I had hoped.
5,Service,I love this product body toolz and manicure/pedicure kit.The quality is professional and so was the service.Keith
4,please with the kit,I bought this for my college age niece. She was very please with the manicure kit packaging and the quality of the supplies.
1,Poor Quality item,Poor quality item.Zipper broke first time I used it.The toe-nail clipper was not sharpened.Made in Pakisten.
2,Pedicure kit,Ordered this for the pedicure tools but they are small and hard to work with. Probably be okay for kids feet.
5,LSU earrings good product,"These earrings were purchased as a Christmas gift. They were exactly as described. Very cute and seem to be good quality. The price was excellent, much better than at the local stores."
4,Just what I needed,With the large and bright flourescent displayand quick results this is exactly whatI needed. Very happy with the purchase.
5,This is a great calculator,"I love this calculator, as much as you can love a calculator :>)Works very well. Would reccomend for office or home."
4,A Practical Plethora Of Print-ulating Possibilities!,"My life changed for the better on the day I added this machine to my desk. No longer do I have to tabulate the incoming checks for the office using an abacus! No longer to I have to scratch the list on a flat stone with a piece of charcoal! The 21st century has arrived, and it IS the Canon P170-DH Printing Calculator!!! Numbers are tabulated in no longer than it takes to hit the * key. The display shows my progress with a pleasant green glow. Big, easy-to-use keys hearken back to those giant learning calculators I used in elementary school, which gives a nice sense of nostalgia while using this product.When I first opened the box, I thought, ""Things are going to be different from now on."" They certainly were. The Canon P170-DH Printing Calculator holds a place of honor next to my bright red Swingline stapler.Summary: Calculator is adequate; does what you expect it to, just a wee bit noisy."
2,Finicky,"Nice readout, but probably inaccurate as it's very finicky with me. The weights fluctuate like crazy and I know that it's impossible to swing up and down 4 lbs from day to day."
3,Wish it was bigger and came with the battery,"This scale is great, but I wish it was a little bigger. My feet almost hang off the sides. Also the batter to make it work did not come with the scale, wish it did."
3,"""Interesting"" Tidbits about the Rich and Powerful.","This short non-fiction novella is filled with ""interesting"" tidbits about the rich and powerful. For example, in the book Lady Ina Coolbirth, who was reportedly Nancy ""Slim"" Keith, a New York socialite and fashion icon, said that, ""...When I was eighteen and a guest in his house, a friend of his daughter Kek...the old bugger [Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.]slipped into my bedroom. It was about six o'clock in the morning...and when I woke up he was already between the sheets with one hand over my mouth and the other all over the place - right there in his own house with the whole [Kennedy] family sleeping around us."""
2,A sad end,"This is a sad end to a literary career destroyed by drugs, alcohol, and personal stupidity. Consisting of cafe' society gossip and scandals, this will appeal to no one but the Capote fanatic. As Capote's reputation for accuracy when spreading tales was abysmal, you won't learn anything from this. Far from being enjoyable, I wondered why he wasted his talents on such tiresome froth. One chapter consists of nothing but two society matrons spreading vicious slander. Sad, so sad."
4,"Man, Capote was a witch with a B","This biting account of life with the upper classes is incomplete. What Capote did - did he actually write the whole book or did he destroy what he had written or was this is just fits and starts - eviscerated the very ladies who lunch who were his gaggle of queens. He told tales out of school with the thinnest of veneers over it in this book. There are some real names in it - Gloria Vanderbilt, Lee Radziwill, Jackie Kennedy Onassis - who have speaking parts but for the most part, the stories came down from other Capital Letter Names who saw through the disguises he put them in. This book is best read on a chaise longue with a very dry martini by a pool. You'll need the swim afterwards to clean off the vitriol."
1,Don't buy this drivel,"What a disappointment. I bought the book because of the the flap around it, and, aside from a few good passages, it's just a bunch of gossip about some not very interesting rich people. Capote had clearly left his good days far behind him when he wrote this drivel. Kind of sad, actually."
2,Sigh: So Emblematic Of Capote's Wasted Talent,"Although I've never considered Capote a great writer (or even capable of resembling one), he did write In Cold Blood, one of the finest non-fiction books of the 20th Century. In short, he had genuine talent, which he threw away with both hands (rather like Fitzgerald, though he certainly didn't have his genius). Answered Prayers is, to my mind, proof of this -- magnificently written in parts, but sloppy, disorganized and ultimately pointless. One questions the judgement and motivations in publishing this singularly unfinished piece."
3,Collection of loosely connected stories,"""Answered Prayers"" is written as a collection of loosely connected short stories, some of them better than others. Because the book has no ending, the stories kind of hang in the air by themselves, leaving fragmented memories. I thought about Hemingway's collections of stories when reading ""Answered Prayers"". Observations of life in different colors... The language is superb. One cannot help thinking what the end of the book could have been if Capote cared to finish it."
5,answered prayers,"Oh My GOD! This is by far one of the most disturbing, amazingly tragic books that I have ever read. Buy this book and feel the pain and suffering that only Truman Capote can emote in the written word. Damn him for not finishing it, and pity us for being denied the finished work."
5,Beautiful Music And Awesome Sound!,This DVD-Audio disc rocks! It has gorgeous flowing heavenly music with a super recording. This is a must have for those wanting great majestic music with superb sound.
2,An OK product with deceiving packaging!,"This product, like MANY other anti-aging creams that I've tried is OK, but works no miracles. I don't see much of a difference between this and ordinary face cream, therefore I don't see that it's worth the money. Especially considering that the container it comes in has a false bottom, so you're only actually getting less than half of what you see. I was extremely disappointed to see this. If the company is deceiving in the way they present their product, what else can we expect?I wouldn't recommend this for the deception alone."
4,A Piece of America,Many people including the younger generations like myself have not heard much of Don Mclean. The hit American Pie is perhaps what draws many to his music. On this C.d. you'll find a number of terrific songs that give the same feel as Amreican Pie. This is a great album that anybody can enjoy whether they've been a long time fan or just fell in love with the hit single. I recomend that if you're wondering if you should buy it that you stop wondering and make the purchase. I think that you'll be glad that you did!
5,terre terra,"the best out of the trilogy, my new faveorite, anyone with taste in music should listen to this masterpiece~!!"
4,good,"this is the first jesus lizard record i bought.id recommend goat to any first time listener instead, though bang has some good tracks on it (but it kinda feels like a greatest hits record without all the best jesus lizard tracks.)just buy goat instead then download boilermaker, gladiator, puss, destroy before reading, fly on the wall, chrome, and wheelchair epidemic and your jesus lizard collection will be basically complete."
2,Great Pictures but not enough information given,"The book has a great cover and the Pictures are wonderful. The book cover states "" The Magic of Fat Loss tackles your overweight problems and solves them by showing you how to get Mother Nature on your side."" But what the book does not tell you is what a correct diet is. In fact the Diet section says "" For more information on diet checkout the nutrition section in your bookstore."" I feel that there should be something more on Diet other than check your book store."
2,The basics of fat-burn aerobics,"I agree with the above reviews. These are the basics of the book:Magic=aerobic training combined with weigth training & diet!Duration:Minimum: 30 min (first after 20 min fat burn)Suggested: 45 minIdeal: more than 60 min, e.g. 90 min (after 60 min supercharged fat burning). ""Research has shown that when the exercise lasts longer than one hour the metabolism stays high and hot for quite some time after the exercise is over, burning off fat long after you have stopped working.""Intensity:65-70% of maximum heartbeat rate:220-age*65 or 70%Frequency:At least 3 times a week.Exercises:&#61623; Power walking&#61623; Treadmill&#61623; Stairway&#61623; Cycling&#61623; Aerobics.Mix the exercises or stay with one.Move whenever you can: walk, shop, clean house, climb the stairs..."
4,Pretty good for a small paperback,"Tells you where you need to start. if you are already kind of into the freelane thing, some of it is redundant, but nice little book. Wastn't aware of the opportunities in Corporate writing."
2,"Gravis Eliminator; Nice Features, Poor Quality","It is a nice joystick for the money, but is it worth it? I have bought two of these at different times and both of them have done the same thing! They have broken at the stick, making them useless. They did this without much pressure. What junk! I tried to put them back together, but for some reason, not even Super Glue will work... And of course the warrenty won't cover this! I am now going to try something that I can trust; a Logitech or a Microsoft joystick. They are more expensive, but in the long run, cheaper. I suggest that you don't make the same mistake I did, buying a Gravis."
4,Great Joystick!!!,"This is the most excellent joystick I've ever used! It's value is just great! If you're looking for a good deal for your money, look no further!The joystick itself is very reactive, the POV hat works like a charm, and the precision button can't be beat!The only complaint I have is that when you're moving the stick and you're at the far end, it's hard to reach the buttons. Other then that, It's a pretty darn good joystick. Good one, Gravis!"
1,Save your money.,It happened to me too. The handle broke right off. Odds don't look to good for this product. Wish I'd read these reviews BEFORE I bought mine.
3,Good,"This is a good study but I don't think it's for as young of an age group as it claims. We are using this for my 4 year old and 8 year old and even for my son, who is 8, we REALLY have to change things around and either explain them into simpler terms or even skip sections because they are just too above him. We love what is happening but I think it could have been done better. At this point I think we'll stop using it and hold it until he's a year or two older."
5,Outstanding family devotional,"Our five children are grown and starting families of their own. We were just reminiscing about our family devotion time and wondering if Family Walk is still available. What a wonderful surprise to see it still is! Now our children and their families will be able to experience that daily time learning about how we can apply God's Word to everyday, real life. Our children so looked forward to this time together! They all love God and his Word and we credit this in part to Family Walk."
4,Very cool stuff,"Here's a simple treat:3/4oz dry vermouth1oz hendrick's gin1/4oz sambuca or ouzoand a few shakes of these mint bitters.put over ice and stir.you'll end up with an absinthe-like beverage that is milky, vaguely anise and mint and funky (in a good way)."
5,Great collectors item!,"I just received this plush today! It's a great collectors item, the tag is in complete japanese. I would buy another item like this one because the quality it was in when I received it was incredible, not too mention it is a high quality plush toy for those of you who just want a toy. Overall a great item to purchase for ANY nintendo fanatic!"
1,OUTDATED AND CONSENSUS ONLY,"This is merely a consensus of a limited number of people, many of whom do not practice and others with apparent private agendas. One of the supposed contributors was deceased long before it was even published. Makes me wonder how they even published it.... Pretty much a waste of time and paper."
2,Deutsche WELLE,"I was disappointed. I assumed it was by the original artist...well, it was not.To me, it makes a big difference. They just don't sound the same."
4,Good Companion Indeed,"This is a very nice book about coffee. It explains the history of the drink, the different ways of making it, including glossary's, and also what kind of coffees from around the world there are. Nice buy if you can find it. My edition is from the mid-90's, so I hope there is some kind of update."
3,Taylor 938 Easy-to-Read Mechanical Scale,"Taylor 938 Easy-to-Read Mechanical Scale with 5"" Raised Dial. Nice looking scale but not accurate, its off by six pounds, made me feel good at first then realized I hadn't lost six pounds. (Checked it against two scales at the doctors office and two other scales in my house).I started to return it, but, decided to just go ahead and keep it because returning is too much trouble."
3,"Looks Wonderful, <<Almost>> Accurate","Coming from another Taylor <digital> scale which had zero accuracy OR predictability, I am a bit skeptical about what to expect from this unit for the long haul. However, having just taken the unit out of the box, I feel that the accuracy is within five pounds, depending on the surface it is on and how I lean my weight while standing on the scale. The unit looks fabulous, and as long as I am satisfied to try my weight a few times, and figure it is at least a couple of pounds off in either direction on my final attempt, I am ok with it. I am using it more recreationally, and do not need to record my exact weight on any routine basis."
1,weighing in,"Hate it! Usually an analog type scale will have a line for every 5 pounds, this scale only denotes in 10 lb intervals....I should have taken a better look at it on line before I bought it. I'm going back to digital I think."
2,Needle detached,The needle pointer can become detached does not give and accurate reading.If you are patient and jiggle it just right you may be able to get if back in position on it's post.
2,The title is ironic,"I'm about to buy a new car, and bought and read this book. I was very disappointed, most of the book is hyperactive fiction, I wanted hard facts about true dealer cost and buyer's negotiating tactics. Instead, the hard data is far and few between in this book. After buying ""Don't Get Taken Every Time"" I felt that I had been taken by the publishing business. Not recommended."
5,car buying,I heard about this book on website www.edmonds.com there was a article about info about buying or leasing new cars and there was article talkingabout this book there is so much great information I have bought this book twice once for me and once for a gift. I recommend both the book and the edmonds website for getting information before purchasing or leasing.great read
4,A little dated but still very worth while,"It is well worth your time to read - - and to apply. More than just ""know before U buy."
4,Book Review,"I read the first edition of this book back in the 80's, but, unfortunately, forgot many of the lessons when negotiating our recent last purchase. Had I reread the book, I literally would have saved several thousand dollars (on an $18,000 car!) The update of the book is both entertaining and informative. My only complaint is that it could be a little more tightly written. I suspect that the same information could be conveyed in 2/3's the number of words used. I would strongly recommend it to anyone who is going car shopping."
2,Way too long,"The information in this book is helpful, but I've given it 2 stars because reading the whole book is waste of time. There is too much time spent trying to scare the potential car buyer instead of concisely focusing on what you actually need to know. Some might find his fictional account of car saleman that continues throughout the book to be creative and entertaining, but I didn't want to be entertained; I just wanted the author's insight quickly. I would recommend going to the annual car buyer's guide from Consumer Reports. This has the same information in about 10 pages."
2,Not so straightforward,"The book's purpose was to help us make decisions, but it clearly not organized this way. The whole first half of the book was telling stories after stories on how people's got taken in the past, but they're long and boring, also the author didn't make any attempt on making his point clear. I am always wondering what he's trying to say while I was reading.There is a little portion of the text which gives a little useful advices. But you have to skip through a lot of the usefulless materials in the book to get to those. The advices are short and not quite thorough, though."
1,Terrible toxic smell,This pad has a terrible chemical smell. Cannot bear to keep it on my desk. I agree with the previous customer about the smell. But I am throwing the pad away today. It cannot possibly be beneficial to inhale the fumes from this pad. Forget about the possibility of spending long periods at one's desk working on this pad. The company ought to discontinue it.
3,Not very satisfied with this product,"I bought this to be used as a coffee canister. It would not even hold 1 pound of coffee beans. The metal is not thick and the lid does not seem to be sturdy. Plus, it had a couple of large scratches on the inside."
1,Buyer beware!,"Much smaller than what I though, Someonescrewed up. Will not hold a 30oz can ofcoffee, a little over half?"
4,Great way to end it,"This album is the real experimental one of the trilogy, not the Bootlicker, as the Melvins had said it would be. Lots of different styles converge on this, owing to the guest artists featured. Some old country, some industrial, some punk, and the ever-present weirdness. Overall, it works, but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who hasn't been acquainted with the Melvins already. Any longtime fan will no doubt appreciate it, though. My favorite tracks are Leif Garrett's version of Teen Spirit, Mine is no Disgrace, Divorced, Dry Drunk, and The Man with the Laughing Hand is Dead. I like how they got a bag lady to sing backup on Spineless."
3,Mixed bag.,This disc has a mixture of different artists and styles that doesn't go too far beyond experimental. The two best tracks are SKELETON KEY's SPINELESS and TOOL's DIVORCED. The latter is a long instrumental jam that any fan of TOOL should have a copy of even though MAYNARD is nowhere to be found. All artists on this disc share the songwriting with THE MELVINS (except for TEEN SPIRIT of course) so the sound is raw if not MELVINesque. Worth having for the TOOL tune if you're a fan.
3,I want my melvins straight up NO MIXERS!,"I am an old Melvins fan and if I want to listen to Hank William III I'll go by his own c.d. When I buy a Melvin's c.d. that is just what I want. The Melvins. I thought I would give this album a shot even though my instincts said I shouldn't taint my shelves with it and to let my memory of the Melvins stay pure but I guess I must have been due for some punishment. I don't want good bands to stay stagnant in the same old rut of similar tunes but come on. I am not a big fan of cross genre collaborations but it can work albeit rarely. This one does not. If you are a Melvins fan and want your memory to stay righteous stay away from this one and stick to the tried and true. Although, their new album is good in my opinion."
2,Dissapointed,"I was honestly dissapointed when I recieved the dual layer lightscribe DVD drive. FIrst off, when I received the package, only the drive was included, no directions, no disc, nothing. I was told to contact Computer Geeks directly for questions, since it was purchased through them as a 3rd party. After not being able to get through to them for quite some time because their customer service hours are the exact hours of the work day, we finally got in touch with someone who said he would send us a disc so we could use the driver. We waited for the disc to come and when it did, all it did was take us to a website to load a driver but we didn't know the correct driver to load. In order to be able to get the drive to work I actually bought another drive, thinking i was going to return this one to Amazon, but the new drive had directions and we were able to get it to work."
1,Greatest Hits 1987 - 1997,"A friend had sent me one of the songs, ""I Give You My Word"", I really liked it and thought the rest of t he cd would be similar. It wasn't the kind of music I like to listen to."
2,"Interesting Subject, Frustratingly Boring Presentation","Several years ago I saw Mr. Brittain-Catlin on Charlie Rose and was intrigued enough with the interview to buy his book.I have to assume that he has presented a factual depiction of how offshore banking works, the extent of it use, and its ramification in the the global economy.However, his presentation was so wordy, scattered, and often times boring that I found it sheer drudgery to read. I cannot believe it was edited very carefully.One well written part of the book is his description of how Enron used offshore accounts to hide its losses. Very informative.It's a shame this book isn't better written and edited. Offshore banking is a compelling subject."
1,Offshore: The Dark Side of The Global Economy,"This is one of the most poorly written books I have ever read. It seems to be a compilation of news clips, some history, with pages and pages of endless, obstruse, mind-numbing attempts to tie corporations, offshore banking centers and governments into some sort of socialogical, philosophical analysis. Totally boring, informationally just about useless, wordy, diffuse, and a true waste of money and time....even a one star rating is too much....if you want to learn about offshore...don't try it here....."
5,An important glimpse in to the world of Money and Power,"""Offshore"" is a compelling and disturbing glimpse into the dark underworld of global money and power. It is extremely well-researched and comprehensive, covering international dirty-dealing and capital from Enron to Parmalat to LTCM. Very illustrative and thought-provoking.A first-rate primer on International Capital and also a great read. Pay special attention to the segments on ""the secret realm,"" where capital is free of all national identity and boundaries.In addition the writing is very fluid, clever and witty. An important book."
2,interesting but pretentious,"There's interesting information here, about the role offshore tax havens play in our global economy; much of it is quite revealing, as we learn about the Cayman islands, and what corporations do in order to avoid paying taxes. The author gets pretentious, though (and nearly unreadable) when trying to put a philosophical spin on things... there is a long chapter on that which is simply indigestible, and the interpretations are so forced as to be laughable. If you can overlook that, though (just skip those parts) you'll get some interesting tidbits of information about the way corporations operate."
3,It's a tote.,"It's a tote. It holds files. However, these lids don't seem to fit as well as some other totes from rubbermaid I have and if you don't fill the tote your files can turn sideways and fall off the rails. That is all."
3,Sally Pregnant fisco spoils it for me,"Yes, Sally was Pregnant in this season and then there was the mention of a baby in one episode and he was never seen...then, all of a sudden, the episodes continued with no baby anywhere. No Mention, no siting, nothing...while I love this show, its lack of logic puzzles me. I wonder why the producers did it? Anyone who knows, please advise. Thanks!"
2,video quality is poor,"IMHO compared to other made for TV DVD the quality of the video is not that good. In fact on one DVD there was a warning about video being from historical...The quality is better than off the air recordings. The images are a little fuzzy - not that crisp. There are artifacts which indicates DVDs were not cut from the original.The first episode on each disk has opening for NBC Sunday night movies which advertises Columbo, Hec Ramsey, McCloud, as well as McMillan... In other words there are two episodes per disk.The above comments applies to SERIES FIVE as well (since 5 has 7 episodes the 4th disk has only one episode).All said, it's better than not having any video."
2,No captions,"Since my wife is hearing impaired, I was very disappointed since I had purchased this DVD for her. I think Amazon should make it more obvious with a note when a movie or TV program is not closed captioned."
2,Unfriendly remote and instructions,"In 3 hours of frustrated attempts to set up this Christmas present, I'm unable to get _anything_ to display on my TV; no setup screens for clock/tuners, nor even get the picture from a VCR to display (though it plays). The instruction manual provides icon images of buttons, but they don't match what's on the remote.One single bulleted item says the remote only works with Panasonic TVs. I can only guess this means none of the Panasonic VCR/DVD features works with my JVC TV monitor(my 15 year old Logitech VCR changed channels and ran tapes fine)."
4,Good quality,"A good buy! My Grandmother's TV has only a CATV input so this combo works great without having to buy a converter. If I ever buy a widescreen plasma display for Grammy, I can use the progressive scan component inputs as well! Anyway, I just hooked up the rabbit ears to the input and the TV to the output. I was up and running in no time!"
5,Dawn Simulator not a Rude Awakening,It's amazing how the dawn simulator feature of the NatureBright Inspiration 3 changes the way my body responds to waking up on these dark mornings. The setting allows the room to start coming to light at 4:30 a.m. so when the alarm goes off at 5:00 my brain has already registered the change. I don't feel like I'm being awaken from the dead. I'm considering a second purchase for my desk at work for the full spectrum light therapy feature that I don't take time for at home.
4,"Easy to use, easy on the eyes","I bought this for my bedside table. Usually my eyes begin to burn when I read in bed at night, but now that I have this, they don't. I like the features and the clock. I especially like the dimming feature; you set it to slowly get dimmer over a set amount of time. Likewise, in the morning you can set it to wake you up over a set amount of time. I recommend this to anyone who wants to try NatureBright lights."
2,NatureBright 2 in 1 LED Light Therapy Lamp,"I was excited about this product at the start, since it was described as both a dawn simulator and a light therapy lamp. However, after using it, I believe that its light is too weak to simulate dawn, since it comes only from the lamp, not from all over the room, as the real light of dawn would. As a light therapy lamp, it was OK, but expensive for this purpose. Instead of buying this, I wished I had bought an Apollo blue light simulator, which costs about the same as this lamp. If you want a bright lamp for desk use, this would serve the purpose, although it is expensive compared to just using a full-spectrum bulb in your current desk lamp."
3,"Light, but cheap","The light itself works well, when I wake up, I tend to feel more rested. The lowest setting on the dimmer (first stage of sunrise) is too bright, and if the light is facing me it will wake me immediately, so I have to turn the light away from me. Also, the plastic the lamp is made looks and feels very cheap, it certainly doesn't look like a $160 lamp. The audible alarm if the light (sunrise) doesn't wake you is very quiet and I often have to rely on a second louder alarm so I don't keep sleeping. It helps, but still leaves a lot to be desired."
4,NatureBright to beat winter wake up blues,My husband and I purchased this lamp because we enjoy waking up gradually to the sunrise much more than the heartstopping buzz of an alarm clock. The lamp does a good job of gradually brightening the room over 30 minutes although the dimmest setting is still a bit too bright for me. (It would probably startle a light sleeper.) It's a definte improvement over waking up to winter darkness.
1,Disappointed,I found this product to be cheaply made and not worth the price. I returned it and will not buy anything else made by the company.
1,Do not purchase this if you use Windows Vista/7!,"As shipped, this product doesn't work with Windows Vista (or Windows 7), and there are no drivers available for Vista or 7 either. I did hook the camera directly to a monitor, and the video quality is acceptable. However, the inability to record video (without the appropriate drivers) made it useless for my application."
5,We both thought is was great,"My fiancee and I had to read this book as part of our pre-martial classes at our church. We both thought it was a great book. Some points may have been a little redundant but overall, the book really showed us how to have a God-honoring marriage. I would highly recommend it to any couple preparing for the covenant of marriage."
4,Good marriage advice with religious basis.,"I'm not what you'd call emphatically religious but found this book a terrific guide for men caught between what they want and what is right for their marriage. If you're married, this book can help keep the peace, but only if you have an open mind and heart! If you plan to be married, this book can be a guide and conversation starter between you and your betrothed when discussing real life marriage issues. You don't have to agree with absolutely everything the book says to come away with information that can save, improve, or build up your marriage."
3,no refunds,"This shoe was beautiful online, but turned out to be extremely pointy in the toe once I received it in person. Plus, it was just a little too high for someone already 6 feet tall. I sent it back and STILL have not received my refund on my credit card. Still waiting."
5,Short but sweet,"This video is only an hour, but the music is all quality. Rick and his ensemble play brilliantly in this intimate but excellent performance. A definite must for Rick fans and for anyone who appreciates good, pompous music."
3,Read with Care,I read this work slowly and in pieces. I found the story profoundly disturbing. I could take it only in small doses. It is hard to imagine middle class Americans behaving toward each other in such profoundly evil ways.I have no doubt this story happened for real in pretty much the way presented in this book. Thank you.
2,Unbiased? Yea right......,"I also bought this book as it claims to be an ""unbiased"" look at the subject. Sorry, but unbiased it is NOT. It's painfully obvious within the first few pages that the author is stacking the deck against the Mormon religion as a whole, and gets worse as the pages continue to turn. Obviously we all know by now that the LDS church was directly involved with the tragedy that occurred. With this book's claims I was hoping for an additional or different perspective, or maybe even some evidence or history that others haven't came across yet, to shed some more light on the subject; instead so far the author has presented several claims based on hearsay or rumor, false information (several of her researched ""facts"" are of questionable validity or are exaggerated), and many of the quotes she uses are taken out of context so they will fit into her verbal vendetta. Sad to report I was greatly disappointed."
4,Mormonism,"Excellent historical review of the darkest episode in Mormon history. Can highly recommend it to those interested in a factual account of the event, but not to those interested only in maintaining their comfort level within Mormonism."
1,The other side,"I think that it is very interesting that the author, Ms. Denton, has somehow found a way to interpret the very contradictory documents relating to this tradgedy. She admits herself in this book that there is a ""lack of evidence"" - yet she continues to tell the story as if she were there, picking and choosing which documents she feels are ""factual"" - all of which implicate Brigham Young - then prophet of the church. Could she have a predjudice born of a father who was dissatisfied with this church and raised his children on bitterness and hard feelings? She even tells the story of her father stopping at Mountain Meadows everytime they passed it to tell his children of the story - Mormons who killed women and children. Where did her father get his information? Overall, I think it is a poor excuse for an accurate look at this particular event. Thank you for an interesting fiction read though."
2,Where's the footnotes and professionalism?,"I read a lot of primary medical research and am used to relying on footnotes. I got sick of all the paragraphs that made statements but had no supporting references. Even if I don't look them all up, I like to see that references are available. I couldn't stand it any more and gave up. I took to heart the comments in the other review titled ""Bagley's Blood of the Prophets a Better Investment"". It didn't help that I listened to a local radio interview wherein the author was asked what her biases were. Her response? ""I have none"" (the interview was done by a Salt Lake City public radio station in July 2003). Everyone has biases, and if this author doesn't realize that, she has no way of taking those biases into account to write an objective book, which she claimed to have done. This book contains this author's views, which though it may be ""readable"" certainly was not satisfying to me."
1,Poor History!,"Another anti-Mormon diatribe! The author's motivation must be questioned. A hate-filled, vindictive volume."
1,Design Flaw,"This joystick is terrible. I bought it primarily for Fighter Ace II and so far I have gone through 2 and the the third is in the mail. Apparently they have some sort of design problem where the rudder control actually breaks! This is not a software issue. While Gravis' customer service has been very happy to keep sending me replacements, enough is enough. I would highly recommend purchasing another controller."
2,more programming than flying,"bought this item around the same timeas the reviewer in Tulsa OK also with Fly 2K I have the same problem withrudder control and seems to have other programming issues as well, grat idea for a stick with all the programmable button features."
2,Guess What,"Bought this stick on strenght of reviews elsewhere. The stick worked well initially, however, it obvious that the reviews I read did not test long term reliability.After a couple of weeks of light usage, guess what, the twist handle rudder function broke. Have emailed technical support and await a response. Hoping it is still under warranty so I can get my money back."
3,Pretty good...,"I'm 13 and this game entertains me. It's not necessarlily the best, like the Ratchet and Clank series. This game would be good for younger audiences like children 6 to 9. Tak and the Power of Juju and Tak 2: the Staff of Dreams video games are just like this game. I would recommend all 3 of these games to younger game players."
3,Well written book; have remarks though.,"It was Descartes whose analysis that dogs don't have feelings led to the justification of all manner of cruelty towards animals. For anyone planning to read this book, also expand your horizons and read ""The Intelligence of Dogs"" by Stanley Coren, psychologist and dog trainer"
3,fun lift-the-flap for Jellabies fans,"This book consists of seven two-page spreads and an end page, depicting the Jellabies' search for their comrade Pepper. The Jellyscope is broken and only Pepper can fix it.As we search for Pepper we meet each of the other Jellabies and view their special objects -- the Jelly train, the Jelly balloon, etc. Each spread contains one large flap to lift, wherein a Jellabie tells us that Pepper is not there and joins the search.Flaps are thin and could easily be torn."
5,exiting....,wow i so cant wait to find out what this is about. it will most likely be really good like the other two movies. Bratz are the best and i really think that you bratz haters (my scene lovers) should stop saying this stuff about bratz its really annoying. you should go review my scenes because you can say they are good and bvratz fans review bratz and say they are good. i never rewiew my scene dolls because i am a bratz fan so yer. so lets end this war. anyways luv yaz all bratz fans and luv ya bratz!! plus my scene fans if u stop saying bad reviews about bratz i promise 2 neva go and giv ms dolls bad reviews
1,BOOOOOOOOOO!,"I watched this show, just for laughs, and omg it sucked. This show suked so bad honustly i laughed what stupid characters i hate the blonde chix and Jade is a loser in this show it is almost funny. :) I don't know why anyone would buy this, what poor animation, too, it's cheapX100, (they made it like that to save money) they should have made it cartoon like that Bratz movie that came out in 2004. Bratz are getting old anyways, so is Barbie and My Scene. I HATE THIS SHOW. BOOOOOO!**PUNKSTAR**"
4,I can't believe you are fighting in a review forum,"It is beyond belief that there are reviews for a movie that isn't even out yet, and that you all are fighting in the review section of the DVD. Please leave this for reviews of the movie and not bad mouthing dolls, etc. Let the girls like the dolls and play with them."
5,Not Another BRATZ Movie,"BRATZ fans, this is not another movie of BRATZ, this is a BRATZ TV SERIES Episode Collection, volume 1! Including the episode ""Slumber Party"" (Which airs on FOX CHANNEL ~ October 4, 2005, 4Kids Tv, channel 2, 9:00 am)The next movie of BRATZ will be in the MOVIE THEATRES, well at least that's what I heard from a magazine article:)Anyway...BRATZ ROCK ANGELZ RULE!!!"
3,great for self esteem,"I liked this book for a refresher for my son as he entered 2nd grade. I felt it was a bit too easy for him, though. He went right through the whole book in one sitting. He didn't even start second grade and he was able to do the whole book without help. It was good for his self esteem. He thought he was so smart. He could do all the second grade work without even starting the grade! I have to say that it kept his interest and he wanted to do work, so it accomplished what I wanted. I just wish it had more."
4,Black metal Loft Bed,"I really like the way it's structured but was a bit disappointed that the futon cushion did not come with it. I was under the understanding that it did. I knew the matress didn't but it seemed that in the description, it mentioned the futon cushion."
3,bunk bed,"did not open, noticed on outside of box that was sent a twin bed instead of full have to reorder"
3,Bunk review,"This product was difficult to put together with the ""tools"" provided. The futon mattress was very hard to find and is not sold with the unit. THe bottom futon is not for everyday use. The futon is thin and difficult to find a cover for. Top bunk and desk are a great combo. Ok for one child not ok for two."
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS CROOKED COMPANY,"Bought this bed on AUG 6th....arrived on Aug 13th..DAMAGED... contacted AtHomeMart whom sold the bed about damages...After numerous phone calls over weeks.. the company offered a $150 refund plus send some missing hardware.......I waited until NOVEMBER 26, 2010 (talk about patience) for the refund to show to my credit card....NOTHING.....after calling AtHomeMart on November26, 2010. they say they can only send $100...I HATE LIARS...I Will NEVER buy anything from them again !!!!!"
3,Bunk Beds good,"Not a bad bed, I'm glad I bought a metal one, so I can take it apart and out it together whenever I want! Great bed for the price, like how it looks. I Bought mine from [...] because it was cheaper lol"
5,Great background and foreground music,"Lily Frost has a great voice that works as a kind of lounge singer in the background if you're doing other stuff, but she also has a great voice to pay attention and sing along to. Particular favorites of mine are ""Out of Blue"" and ""Where is Love?"""
5,The REAL Rachmaninov,"Who says Rachmaninov's music is shallow and too sentimental? Blasphemy!! Maybe some over-indulgent performances by naive pianists give that impression, but on this recording, with the composer himself at the keyboard (and he was one of the greatest of all pianists) there isn't the faintest suggestion of sappyness anywhere. Sure, there's passion in his ""interpretation"" (if you can call it that) but he lets his passion flow through the music, not overwhelm it.Of course, the audiophile types who love glitz and glitter won't be pleased by the prehistoric recordings, but I say, great musicianship over great technology!! Don't miss out on this just because of the sound quality. It's a five-star performance if I ever heard one.I'd suggest getting, along with this, the companion disc, featuring the (undeservedly) less well known 1st and 4th concertos and the Paganini rhapsody"
5,Sublime!,"There is no better recording of the No. 2 concerto. Stokowski and the Philadelphia players are inspired; and the beauty, dynamic range (even on this vintage recording), and technical command of the composer's handiwork are unapproachably sublime. This is one of the great recordings of all time."
5,Rachmaninov you never knew..,"..until you hear this.It's like the first time I heard Heifetz playing Brahms' violin concerto on the RCA recording - the flow, the speed, the unimaginable sense of freedom lacking in violinists/ pianists after the Heifetz/ Rachmaninov generation. Somehow musicians after that era began to grow ""slow fingers"" and shallow spirituality and it became unknown to listeners how music used to sound so free - well, they couldn't have known. We couldn't have known.Until recordings like this came along.So, if you're curious in even the slightest sense and think you can listen beyond the mono sound (which sounds blurred and overloaded with hisses compared to modern stereo recordings), you owe yourself a chance to discover what music making had been and gain a ""new pair of ears"".It's a pity for those who can't tolerate anything other than ""audiophile"" sound."
3,Track Listing,Track Listing:The twistPony timeLet's twist againLimbo rockThe HucklebuckSlow Twistin'Popeye the hitchhikerDancin' partyLet's limbo some moreTwist it upDance the mess aroundTwenty miles
2,We're a little lost now,"Best line in the book, as it sums it up for me and was just about the only part I understood. In Plateau 3, ""The Geology of Morals,"" the authors write, first line of 14th paragraph: ""We're a little lost now.""Exactly. Lost."
4,Love the cup - wish it was bigger,"Looking for a sippy cup for my 2 year old that doesn't restrict the flow and this does just that. The last sippy cups I got was even hard for me to suck liquid out of. And they can be thrown in the microwave which is a great bonus! The only downside is that I would have loved if it came in a little larger size. It holds about 6 ounces, 7 maybe if I fill it to the brim. I would love a 8 or 9 ounce cup instead. The plastic also looks sturdy so I don't expect it to fall apart anytime soon. And there are only 2 parts: a cup and a lid. Nothing else to clean and put together. :)"
2,Solid built but not usable,"Even though, the product is built well. Problem is leaking. These cups are intended for toddler use, and they are easily toppled and top leaks. If this was built for an adult.. bravo then!"
4,Best Sippy Cups,"This is the best sippy cup I've found, and I've gone through quite a few. What a waste of money with all the other cups I've been through; for the same amount of $$ I could've gotten these plus change left over! My baby wasn't able to suck out of all the ""leak proof"" sippy cups (and I've bought at least 3-4 others) but these he'll happily use. Plus, it's a two for one because you can use it as a regular cup afterwards. And there are only two parts to wash!One thing you have to beware of though -- DO NOT BOIL these per the instructions! I did, and it warped the lids so badly there was no way it would fit back onto the cups; so minus one star. Since they were cheap I just got more."
5,Good for starters drinking sippy cups,Good price. Pretty colors. Only 4 ounces. Loved by the little ones. A lot like the tupperware ones.Recommend to you.
1,Cheap Lids,These were the only microwave safe cups i could find.After a month of use the lids are cracking around the edges.
4,Best sippy cups,These cups are PERFECT for a toddler. No they are not spil proof. But I use them for my daughter at meal time. She can drink Orange juice and smoothies with these cups because they have a solid opening instead of just holes on top. Which also means no sucking. Great cups to transition to a big girl cup. (I must note the 4 stars is because I didn't get the right colors. I ordered the pink/purple/blue set and got green/yellow/blue instead.) Might have been a mistake but either way these are worth every penny.
4,Good basic cup,"I've been searching high and low for a sippy cup for my baby who never took a bottle and transitioned straight to a sippy. The good thing about this cup is that you can tilt it upside down and there's a small drip of liquid that comes out. In other words, it is not spill proof. It works for my child because he's doesn't really suck the liquid out so the small drip will allow him to learn that there is liquid in the cup and he can start to suck. Also, it allows the parents to ""force"" them to drink. It's a good quality cup. It's thick (not the cheapy plastic) and the lid is very secure. It is also super easy to clean. There are only 2 parts to it (cup and lid!). These days, the sippy cups are so fancy and super hard to clean. You can also use this as a plain cup without the lid once your child graduates from a sippy. It makes a great kids's cup."
5,Love these cups!,"I bought these originally for my daughter who is now 6 years old. We bought more of them for my son who is now 3 years old. and I just recently bought some more for our daughter who just turned 1. So yes, we love these cups! My wife had bought all manner of different cups for the kids over the years and our cabinets were overflowing with different cups and lids. It was a nightmare trying to find matching sets quickly while a toddler is screaming and pulling at your leg! I begged her to toss everything except these cups, which stack neatly. She met me halfway and tossed about half of the assorted bottles/cups. These cups with the cover work great for our 1 year old. They also still work good without lids for the older kids. Since the cups are cheap and shipping isn't, I recommend buying in groups of at least three, you won't be sorry!"
5,Very Good Product,I have used these labels on my CDs for over 5 years. They have not peeled even on the CDs I keep in the car through Summer and Winter.
2,Shipping problems,"My home town is Anasco, Puerto Rico (USA), but you did not ship to PR.For me is very inconvenient having to purchase thru a main land State address.PR is a commonwealth of USA and we do use USPS, UPS and FedEx.Why don't you ship to PR?"
2,Less then expected,It is useful only for beginner travellers.I missed the practical and detailed informations.
1,This book is by far the WORST Frommers publication,"I always use Frommers books for my vacations, but I have to tell you that this book is the biggest waste of money I have ever spent on Amazon or any other book store for that matter. The author obviously has not done her job here. Be careful, you just might wind up in Iraq if you follow her guides. This book is very vague and confusing throughout. You can not trust her hotel recommendations. How in the world can she justify putting Apricot hotel in Istanbul in this book. This guy is a crook. This hotel should be taken out of this book completely for it's opportunistic behavior. Have you ever heard the phrase BAIT AND SWITCH? BUYER BEWARE? Well, that should be the heading for all her recommendations if they are all like the Apricot hotel in Istanbul. My advise to the author, have a chat with the guy who wrote the Frommers Italy book, you can learn alot from him."
5,Turkish trip planner recommends Frommer's Guide to Turkey,"As a yacht charter broker and trip planner specializing in Turkey, my clients often ask me to suggest a guidebook for Turkey. I have begun recommending The Frommer's Guide to Turkey because it is filled with fresh insights and practical information. I have had very positive comments from customers who have purchased it.Ms. Levine's work is clearly the result of thorough, in-person research. She is a dedicated ""good traveler,"" who has made the effort to understand the subtleties of the Turkish culture. Her discussions on a number of commonly asked questions, such as the merits of driving on your own in Turkey, rug shopping, and bargaining were right on target. She writes with wit and a sense of fun!Overall, Frommer's Turkey Guide is superior to other guidebooks on the market, and I will continue recommending it to our customers.Best wishes,Patricia Goksel"
3,a little out of date,"Things have changed in Turkey. The currency has been modernized and preparation for membership in the EU changes other things as well. The book is still dealing with the old currency and you must convert everything. Hotel ratings, restaurants as always need to be checked against standards where they exist. It is not enough to say first class or three star. The historical venues and the directions, advice on what to see probably very valid. Need to get guide that includes the New Turkish Lira."
3,Good but short,The item works as advertized but the direction where bad in that they reference tools that were not in the shipment.
5,reference recordings,"There are a number of fine couplings of the Chopin concertos in the catalog, however, so highly regarded were these Rubinstein recordings that for decades they were the standard by which all others were measured. Have they been superceded? Maybe, but they have a strong advantage in that they reflect what must have been hundreds of performances by the great Chopin pianist going back forty or more years. The best way to describe them is that they are very sturdy but elegant, completely fresh and inspired, splashed with poetic touches and also have plenty of muscle in the virtuoso passages.The sonics, dating from 1958 and 1961, are naturally not state of the art, especially the second concerto which is the older of the two and in which the piano is a little dimmer than I recall from previous LP and cd incarnations. I do, however, think the sound on the first concerto is an improvement over anything I've heard before.Very warmly recommended."
2,SACD What?,The tracks are great. Well transitioned. 5 stars.The audio quality. Sloppy and hisses like a leaky compressor.In order to even listen to this I have to reduce my treble almost all of the way.Never once have I had to adjust my EQ . Not until I played this disk. 1 Star.I'm just telling you what I hear when I play it. I would check something else out if you want good sound.Very disappointing
3,Be careful.,I have never heard such bad recording from technical side. I do not know if it's bad remastering or no remastering at all. It's unacceptable for CD quality not even mentioning about SACD. Sounds beautiful but poor quality.
3,Could be alot better,"I deffinately wouldn't use this if i didn't know any German at all seeing that it starts you off with a passage that you need some German knowledge for. Despite having the English traslation right next to it, its not always literal and you can't just absorb words through osmosis.The beginning however is really well set up with a good basic German vocab and grammar, and dialogues that are reasonably challenging but not too challenging.After half the book though, it just throws too many words at you at one time and expects you to memmorize them all on the spot.I'd recomend Lustige Dialoge instead of this book if you have some previous German knowledge. Lustige Dialoge puts a reasonable amount of new vocab out per chapter, and with vocab cards all of that book can be more easily and less painfully mastered"
3,An Opinion,"This is a pretty good book, for the price. It has useful language themes (travel situations, practical things) and many good sample dialogs to model your language use on. The layout is visually appealing. Its coverage of grammar is a bit skimpy. Yes, it's very simple, but they may have gone too far. There is no grammar index so it's hard to locate various grammatical explanations. The past verb tenses are not explained in the book, which I think is a deficiency. There are a few typos, too."
2,This book was the textbook for Converstational German ...,"in a community college course I took. The edition we used for the course had no CDs. I remained for two quarters, each taught by a different instructor. The first completely ignored the book. The second used the book but supplemented with other material.This book is definitely not for the serious student of German.It is also of no value for a review of German, or for a reference book.It is oriented to people who want to learn vocabulary and phrases oriented to travel, something most books tend to omit. It is probably fine if you just want to pick up some basic phrases for a vacation to Germany."
3,NOT for beginners...,"Do NOT buy this book if you are a beginner in German. It starts somewhere in level two or three and goes on from there. The basics are never really explained. It's more of a complete immersion, than a learn from scratch method."
3,mountain stream,"when i first started to listen to this new age stuff and moving water, it settled my nerves a little and relaxed me. but now it doesn't do as good of a job for me."
2,The music was awful,"I just bought, then returned this CD on the premise that there was no music. There is and if you want just pure and simple sounds of mountain river sounds, this is not it. The music was awful and I could not even hear the mountain stream. Some may find this relaxing. All I need is nature, not someones idea of nature with a keyboard."
5,Nice music ~shipping slow~ packing inadaquate,I like the music but the shipping is slow and packing inadaquate. Most of the multiple cd's I recieved had cracked cases due to putting them in an oversized box and throwing a small packing pillow in.
1,"Brown, tough, inedible","Ick! I planned to add two cans of quartered artichoke hearts to a fancy tortellini and shrimp salad I am bringing to a party in a few hours. What a bummer to open the can and find limp, pale yellow (brown in some spots) soggy artichoke hearts, all with leaves and a portion of the artichoke bottom so tough I couldn't bite through them. Horrible. I threw them out, and will have to carry my dish to the party sans artichoke hearts."
5,Best of All Reeses Artichokes!,"Recommend buying when Amazon has a special offer because these are very expensive. But, the product itself is great. I like the quartered ones better because they seem to put the tender pieces in there. The whole ones have a lot of parts that you can't really eat because they are the tougher outside leaves.I eat them with a little season salt or mayo."
3,"Could be a good resource, but a bit BORING","I've read through this book a number of times and picked up some interesting ideas for the classroom, but nothing that blows me away. Many of the exercises are rehashes of ones I read earlier in the book and that was a bit disappointing. I plan on reading through a number of these lesson plans again, but trust me its not very exciting."
2,Not helpful for a new teacher,"Although many lessons are given, not many examples are shown. It assumes that one knows a lot about teaching the subject and has had similar lessons in the past. Good for experienced teachers, not so good for those new to the subject. I would recommend Resnick's ""Design for Communication"" instead."
2,Graphic Design Class/Curriculum,"The book goes exactly to the nitty gritty of the subject. It draws out a map of the entire Graphic Design class/course. Day by day, class by class, and year by year. The entire course. But, unfortunately, it is also a little out dated without one online link. It is very out dated."
3,"A good story, with some unfortunate choices","Any fan of BABYLON 5 and the ""In the Beginning"" telefilm will likely enjoy this book. Fans of Peter David will certainly love it. Other readers may be annoyed by David's rhetorical excesses. David writes the entire novel in Londo Mollari's first-person perspective, which comes out far more clumsy in print than on film (considering he is _in_ few of the scenes). Some ""extra"" unfilmed scenes, such as one between Sheridan and Sinclair, do not ring true to the characters. Unlike the telefilm, the novel does not stand as well on its own to non-viewers of BABYLON 5. Fans, however, will find much to like."
1,Absolutely Terrible,"I'm amazed at the other reviews for this book. I found it to be one of the worst books I have ever read.It's written in the first person perspective of Londo Mollari and this is the book's main failing. It quickly gets very tedious, constantly reading about Londo's thoughts -- personally I prefer some action.I can only assume that some of the other reviews were by die-hard fans that will accept any[thing] as long as it's B5. But there are far, far better B5 books available than this....I can't imagine any adult actually enjoying it. Take my advice and avoid this book unless you are a younger reader."
5,The best gap filling Babylon 5 book ever written,"The movie ""In the Beginning"" has not yet been shown in my country and that is why I can not compare the book with the movie. Besides, I don't feel a good book should be compared with the movie it is based on. ""In the Beginning"" is a wonderful book. It keeps in line with almost everything in the Babylon 5 universe. Characters, dates, places, occurences, it all feells right. Any B5 fan, who has seen all of the show, such as myself, would feel at home. Although it is regretable that gaps in the story arc are filled in movies and books instead of in the show itself, the book is a ""must read"" for any one who wants to truly understand what led to the creation of the Babylon project, what really happened in the Earth-Minbari war and how it all comes together. Very important info is passed along in the book. The story itself is well written, fluent and enjoyable. I most deffinetly recommend!"
5,Review Babylon 5 in the Beginning,"In the movie I had trouble understanding what was happening, the book cleared it all up. I bought the book because Peter David had written it and was amazed how at how well it was written. I loved some of the quotes Londo used to describe Huamns, and find myself repeating them. This is one of Peter David's best."
5,"Wow, Peter David and Babylon 5 all in one book","When I saw Peter David wrote a Babylon 5 book, I knew it wouldn't be long before I picked up a copy of it. I was not disapointed. This was an excellent novelization of the first full length Babylon 5 movie. I guess what I would tell anybody thinking about reading this book is: watch the movie first because after you read this book, the movie will be dull and missing important parts in comparison."
1,Not a great tool,"Don't expect too much from this book. This book is merely an advertising tool for ebay powersellers. You get to know their history, their ebay IDs, their products and a sales pitch on how great they are. Sure they gave some tips here and there but don't expect any secrets. One seller said that the most important part of a sucessful ebay business is the source of product, but he doesn't reveal his source. Another seller said that drop shipping is an important part of his business. You don't have to touch the product and you can save storage space. Great, did he tell us which company he uses to drop ship? Nope.Again, don't expect any secrets. If you like motivational books and want to read success stories, then I suppose this book might do; but if you're looking for secrets to start or enhance your current business, get another book. Try Marsha Collier and her various ebay books."
4,Very inspiring for beginners,"This is a pretty good ""how to"" book. However, if you've been selling at all on ebay, there's not a whole lot of ""secret"" left to much of the text - a lot of it I had figured out on my own through trial and error. If you haven't sold much on ebay, the PowerSellers success stories will definitely be inspiring. For more advanced ebay sellers, I'd suggest ""The 7 essential steps to successful ebay marketing""- I picked up a copy the other day, and read it in a night! It's more of a strategy book than a ""tip"" book and I'm confident that it's going to help me earn more money with my ebay business."
3,Not a How to Manual but interesting,"Not sure what I expected. Ive never read much about doing business on eBay but thought it was time. Interesting stories. The format is to give you pointers by telling the stories of successful folks using eBay and the Author does that. I didnt find it terribly helpful for someone starting out and that maybe wasnt the intent but it was informative. I found that you had to dig a little for the secrets, maybe as it should be who knows? But an okay read, worth the price."
4,The Ebay Millionaire: Titanium Power Seller Secrets ....,"I like the practical, useful advise from several titanium power seller."
1,"For Inspiration only, author lack of knowledge of subject","I agree with another reviewer who states no secrets revealed, only for inspiration.One annoying point about book is the writer, who says she used to sell on ebay, but as the book is in interview format, and judging by her newbie questions, and lack of techological knowledge, she didnt sell too much!"
1,Was an ok book.,I read this book and hoped to find several new ideas but I was very disappointed. I could not find a lot of new information in the book. Certainly the price tag is too high too.
2,For those interested in uniforms,"This volume of the Osprey Military series might be a bit of a disappointment for some. It mainly deals with the uniforms and equipment of the German U-boat crews from 1914 for 1945. For anyone interested in uniforms this book should be a good reference. Readers interested in the organisation, training and work of U-boat crews will have to look elsewhere. The illustrations by Darko Pavlovic are good."
3,regret,Installed on Toyota Matrix. I hear grinding every time I apply brakes. I am going to have to replace with ceramic instead.
3,Not enough photos,"If you really have to SEE a room to visualize the way it will look, the tips here won't do it for you. Sure, there are some good ideas but I found myself frustrated by the very small section of color photos.Also, some of the tips needed to be explained more clearly. In particular, the section on flower arranging needed more than a description of vases and suitable flowers. Photos or even illustrations would have been extremely helpful.For those of you who are do-it-yourselfers, there are plenty of easy projects like chair throws and and floor runners but no examples of what they look like in various rooms.If you ALREADY know what you want to put in your rooms, this book could be an excellent guide to finding or making the items inexpensively. Otherwise, I'd opt for something with more photos and examples."
5,Revelations of Divine Mercy,"The revelations are soul searching and inspiring. This is the highlight of everyday and helps me to direct my energy towards a positive life working for eternity with our Lord. It also helps me to realize how painful life can be at times but with faith, the mercy of the Lord is always present."
3,"solid maze, great fun.","This is a well made product. Be sure to read reviews on other brands, I found that the quality is a issue. On this unit it is a good product, as advertised."
2,great game - wood has warped,the rail scapes against it's adjacent rail making the labyrinth very frustrating to operate. I'm going to return for a full refund.
1,Too expensive,The one on Amazon cost way too much. I found same thing for 1/2 the price at mindware.com. I don't believe any of them are as good as the Labyrinths sold years age but they are still fun.
2,Not good,"The toy was not good as expected. Maybe a defective unit, These have to be calibrated quite well. I purchased after playing on iphone/tablets, but the physical version did not live up to expectations. The wood also was not very high quality."
3,Just okay...,"Seemed like a good toy, but it's not that easy to use successfully. My grandson lost interest in it rather quickly. I'm kind of neutral on it."
3,Good synopsis of Brazil's history,This is a good synopsis of Brazil's history although it offers little new or fresh. Useful for students writing papers or trying to learn about Brazil.
4,FUN MOVIE,Tale of an executive producer (McAdams) who joins a failing network in the hopes to revitalize it before it gets pulled. The quality of the show is amped up by some of the big names in the film. Humor gets really good when McAdams sensationalizes the morning news with all types of crazy actions. Ernie was the best supporting character in the film for those laughs. CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; STORY/PLOTTING: A minus; HUMOR: B; OVERALL GRADE: B plus to A minus; WHEN WATCHED: early April 2011.
4,"Funny, Sweet and Fun.",Fun date night movie. About 4/5 comedy and 1/5 romance. The acting is good and the plot speeds along. No complaints.
5,Heart warming.,This Movie is a KEEPER!The movie is kinda a love story which is not necessarily about the polarized News and a little bit like the movie `Working Girl' but other than that I can't tell you anymore without spoiling it for you.
1,"Miscast, doesn't work","This film is terrible. From the opening scene I was sympathizing with the characters who were being ugly to Rachel McAdam's character. I felt like being ugly to her , too! She was trying to portray a character a la young Diane Keaton/Meg Ryan-type ingenue with spunky dithering cuteness, and it was intensely irritating. With that cast it should have been an entertaining movie. But it wasn't. I don't think Rachel McAdams is that great an actress. But at least she was ok in ""Sherlock Holmes"". In this film she is annoying. Diane Keaton is not bad. Harrison Ford is doing some bizarre imitation of Darth Vader with laryngitis. Just unsatisfying in every way a movie can be unsatisfying. We weren't able to watch until the end."
3,Cute Movie,"If you're looking for a nice, simple comedy, this will will serve your purposes. If you don't like awkward moments, this is not the movie for you."
5,Loved it!,Funny captivating movie that leaves you not asking for your money back. Rachel McAdams is wonderful as is Diane Keaton and Harrison Ford. Worth your time!
2,"Needs a little more to ""get those ratings up""","It was ok. A little on the boring side (about as boring as Daybreak News). A couple of good parts, but that's about it."
3,Great cast in a less than stellar movie,"I love the beautiful Diane Keaton. Her style, timing, and delivery are nearly perfect. I'll watch her in almost anything.I used to think the same thing about Harrison Ford. However, Morning Glory isn't one to keep his reputation going for me.Ford's attempt at the curmudgeonly 'star' wasn't interesting. Yes, he was supposed to be irritating--and he was--but my irritation wasn't so much with his character, but with his performance. Mostly, he appeared to have recently sucked on sour citrus to maintain the pinched angry appearance. It's not a good look for him.At the end, I was left with questions about why/how Angela Lansbury was supposed to be the worst there is."
4,Quite satisfied,"This is a great movie! I had seen it a couple of times before I decided to get a copy myself. It's an over happy, fun movie."
1,Major DUD - Don't believe these reviews,"I have always liked Rachel McAdams but not in this movie. The movie started out slow and boring; I really hoped it would get better but unfortunately, it did not. The movie wasn't funny and there was no chemistry between the stars. I wanted to like this movie but I did not and my biggest mistake was watching it to the very end. I will NOT be buying this movie."
1,Annoying Workaholic,"This may have been the worst ""romantic comedy"" I've ever seen. There was no comedy nor romance, instead this movie is about an annoying young woman who works too hard. She is both annoying and she works too hard so we should call this genre ""annoying workaholic"". In that this is the first of it's kind it may win best of class."
2,Morning Glory...it's ok if you like swearing,"I did not get very far in this movie before there was profanity. I try my best to watch movies that are family and value friendly. Like I stated above...I don't think I got more than five or ten minutes before it started, so I stopped it and will not watch it again."
2,Didn't hit the mark for me,"I see this has an average of 3 1/2 stars, but I can only give it two. If you are a really big Rachel McAdams or Harrison Ford fan, then it is probably an automatic watch, but I thought the plot did not flow well at all, and for me, was too predictable. Rachel has one great scene in a staff meeting, Harrison has some great rants. Jeff Goldblum may be the highlight of the film, his minor supporting role is so well delivered that I found myself wanting to see more of his character. The film ends predictably for me. Overall, I'd say you need some particular interest in one of the stars, or an interest in TV news production to really like this film."
4,Morning Glory,Enjoyed it! It was hilarious. Watched it the theatres 4 times in Singapore. Couldn't wait for the DVD to be available here. Found it on Amazon. Got it after 30 days. Still not available in stores.
1,ok concept - thrown away by bad script,"I felt like there were large parts of this script which seemed to have gotten stuck in the copy machine. I generally like Ms. McAdams, but this was not her role. In addition, the love story was a completely unbelievable laugher. Also - i might add that it has perhaps the worst soundtrack I have ever heard. Unimpressed."
5,Morning Glory was Glorious,Loving almost all Rachel McAdams movies I decided to give this movie a try. I loved the trailer and it had well known actors like Diane Keaton and Harrison Ford so I knew that it had to be half way decent.As I started watching the movie I found that movie's theme and message connected with me. I think that this is not only a comedy but also a tearjerker at some moments. I would recommend it to all who love comedies and romance!
4,Feel Good movie,"I wanted to see this in movie and didn't get a chance so I was glad to see in here. I enjoyed it all good story line, music, nothing bad to say at all, and I have already recommended the movies to family and friends. Watch it!"
3,Too much back ground music,"The story is great but there is too much back ground music and noise. It's just an OK movie, I guess I wasn't in the mood for so much noise. The music is great just not during the talking and there are a lot of music montages."
3,Cute,"This is not a great movie, which it should be given the actors in it. Instead it is a cute romantic comedy. We enjoyed it, but I don't know that I would recommend paying to rent it - wait until you find it on TV one day."
5,really nice,it makes me cry and laugh at the same time.the cast was great and I really enjoyed it. I will never be tired to watch.
3,Its okay,I love the cast but this movie didn't live up to my expectations. I think these actors would be great together just in another movie.
2,"New York, New York - Ughhh!","Positives:(1.) Ford's acting.(2.) Some actually creative, not redux a thousand times before, funny lines.Negatives:(1.) It took me one minute seventeen seconds into the film to recognize a New York (or thereabouts) production. Why? Their sense of romantic comedy is always, always the same WoodyAllenesqe romantic stereotype with the same physical characteristics (Barbie/Ken doll mold) and mental inaptitudes hiding some never imagined talent held back by some uniquely NewYorker emotional insecurities and all taking place between buildings, apartments, restaurants and perhaps a park setting - as usual.(2.) Cookie cutter acting (Ford exception).(3.) Can't urban romanticism be creatively presented in some other way than the same same same fantastical way? It may sell but it's getting old."
4,Refreshing and funny,"A young morning show producer is brought in to revitalize a declining program. Not expected to succeed, she attempts to do so by firing the current co-host and bringing in a veteran newsman who believes that the soft stories typical of such shows are beneath him. He feuds with virtually everyone, and the new producer tries to make the show work. The film worked for me, with Rachel MacAdams superbly cast in a role that she is perfectly suited for. Just enough insights are provided into the behind the scenes at a morning show, and the movie is lighthearted enough to keep the audience entertained."
4,The power of positive thinking...,"""Morning Glory"" (2010) is directed by Roger Michell (Changing Lanes, Venus, Notting Hill). The film is about a young tv show producer, Becky Fuller (Rachel McAdams), who gets a call from a national network to produce a morning show called Daybreak. This morning show is in a shambles with one producer being fired after another but Becky is determined to make things work, and she even brings in a stubborn old news anchor played by Harrison Ford, whom she has always admired, to try and raise the ratings for the show. But initially this results in what seems like a downward spiral for this 40 year old show as there is immediate conflict with the current morning anchor (Diane Keaton). This wonderfully uplifting movie reveals how a positively motivated person can affect change for the better to those around them."
4,Enjoyable!,I hadn't heard of this film and gave it a shot. I was pleasantly surprised by how enjoyable it was. The story isn't anything ground breaking and revolves around a TV Producer trying to save a tanking morning news show. What makes it so good are the performances. Rachel McAdams just breathes life into this role and you just tag along with her for the bumpy but comedic ride. A-List stars Harrison Ford and Diane Keaton are impeccable and even more so that they take a slightly back seat to give Rachel McAdams her due performance. All three are brilliant and play off in each other with wonderful timing while adding some humanity and feeling to it all.
4,"Watchable, but not deep","I expected the subject matter (morning television news) would mean some shallowness, and I was not disappointed. While the pace was sufficient to keep things moving along, in the end this story did not engage me with its characters. A pleasant enough way to spend two hours (at least I don't want them back)."
4,Fun and light entertainment,"It's not heavy, deep, or even all that moving, but it's fun and enjoyable nonetheless. A young producer (Rachel McAdams) is laid off from one show and manages to get hired on as executive producer of another dying show ""Daybreak"". Her tireless drive and enthusiasm finally turns the show around despite the cynicism of a cantankerous old news anchor (Harrison Ford), just in time for her to have to make a fateful decision as to her own future.It's possible to dissect this movie into tiny little bits, but others have long since done that. I'm just going to say, it's great light entertainment on a lonely evening and I recommend it thoroughly."
3,Somewhat entertaining,"McAdams is good, Ford is good, put them in a movie together and you have a halfway decent flick.I wouldn't watch it again, but I don't feel like I wasted my time."
2,What a waste,"This movie is slow and stays slow throughout the entire movie. I couldn't even finish it, what a waste of Rachel McAdams."
4,Pleasant not hilarious,"a cute little entertainment, with a plucky heroine and grumpy co-workers. All players do their part, none make you want to work with them at their last place news show/entertainment."
4,"Cute, fun comedy","This is yet another variation on a basic Hollywood formula movie - a few name actors, up and down struggles followed by happy resolution, the tension between career and personal life, friends supporting each other, heartless and selfish corporate bosses, older people who still ""have it"", a little casual sex, and no deep message or purpose. I have to like a movie, however, that made me laugh really hard, smile a lot, and like the characters. I also found the story a good parody on TV morning variety shows. Moring Glory makes a nice ""date"" movie, or fluffy escape after a hard work week."
2,Morning Glory,"Formula script, cute lead actress, but acting (by all stars) was over the top trying to improve the story line. It didn't work."
3,Likable Cast But Falls A Little Flat,"Morning Glory has a likable cast, and some funny moments, but overall it's a comedy that falls flat. Rachel McAdams, as always, is cute and enjoyable but can't quite carry this uneven story. Harrison Ford is at his grumpiest here, which adds to the comedic tone. There are a few cast members I would have liked to see on screen more, including Diane Keaton and especially Jeff Goldblum. Besides the interactions between the two leads, there aren't many laughs to be had."
4,Morning Glory HD on Kindle HD,"Viewed it as streaming HD video on my Kindle HD tablet; currently free for Prime Members. Great veteran cast that had good chemistry in this fast-paced comedy/partial romantic comedy. Would have liked to see Harrison Ford's grumpy character re-develop earlier than so close to the end of the movie. Overall, really enjoyed this movie!"
4,Morning Glory-,Great Confort Movie !!! A Movie to curle up to and watch over and over !! Just a great all around good acting movie that gets you right there in the movie too - Loved it !!
1,Morning Glory,"It was probably the third worst movie I've seen. It spent the entire movie moving from one dissatisfied person to another. It was a complete downer until the very end. It just wasn't worth the time required from my day to get to the end. I made the poor assumption that with Harrison Ford and Diane Keaton in it, that it would be good. They must have bee really hungry to have signed up for this one."
1,Was not impressed,"I was exhausted just trying to follow Rachel McAdams jumping here and there trying to save her job. I was not impressed by the bad language in this movie, I don't think it was THAT necessary."
2,BORING,This movie was terrible. Terrible flow. Didn't like the characters. Not funny AT ALL. Rachel McAdams was annoying in it.
2,Not My Cup Of 'Morning' Joe,"Morning Glory is a comedy that didn't make me laugh as much as a comedy should. I guess it's too sophisticated for me. I prefer comedies that are raunchy and have a lot of fart jokes and stuff like that. During the last twenty minutes of the movie, I grabbed my laptop computer and brought it into the living room and checked my e-mail. That's how bored I was. Although, there are a few giggles contained within, but not nearly enough."
2,Boring,"Was excited about this movie- Diane Keaton, Harrison Ford, and Rachel Mc Adams. But it was not good. I do have to say that at a certain point I was so bored and annoyed that I skipped over a lot of it, so maybe there was something redeeming in those parts. But from what I saw, not fun."
3,"Predictable, but Still OK","""Morning Glory"" is predictable but watchable. The story is about a young female TV producer, Becky Fuller, (Rachel Adams), who loses her job. She moves in with her parents and frantically searches for another job to get out of a ""told you so"" situation. She finally lands a Morning Show job as Executive Producer, but the show's ratings are in the dumps. Working with feuding co-hosts (Harrison Ford and Diane Keaton) keeps her hopping and hoping that something will ""click."" Nothing seems to be working, and the show seems dull and lifeless. Soon her boss (played by Jeff Goldblum) calls her in to say the show is cancelled. Becky begs for one more chance... and the rest is history.Overall the movie is entertaining, and you hope Becky, the young TV producer, will succeed. She has many obstructions to overcome, but, like the Ever Ready Bunny, she keeps trying and trying. The movie gets funny toward the end and, of course, Becky saves the day."
4,Good Blu-ray deals!,"I have bought quite a few blu-rays on Amazon and have been content with all of them to include this one, Morning Glory. I usually only buy ones that I find very funny or enjoyable because you would not want to buy one that you would only watch one time. Very happy with the deals on blu-ray discs I have bought here on Amazon. Thanks!"
4,Enjoyable,"It appeared more chick flicky than it actually was. Harrison Ford plays such a strong, likable character that he balances the neurotic main character nicely. It kept my attention through the entire movie. Its a decent comedy that I imagine most people can enjoy."
2,"Just average, really...2 and a half stars.","A lot people like this band, but five stars??These guys do weave a hypnotic spell. Their dynamic wants to take the listener to a point where you fully expect the music to really take off and rock out. But it never quite does..leaving you wanting more. Like almost achieving orgasm. They do this quite well on songs like Cross Your Eyes, Blue Eurasians and Fanfare; and the effect approaches excitement.They have a good sound and play well. The main problem is that most of the songs just aren't that strong or involving.Not bad, especially for a debut, but not good enough to make me want to rush out and buy their new release...I'll wait til it shows up in the 'used' bin."
3,It aimlessly walks away and never comes back,"With most ambitious albums, the songs take you places you never thought you would go but always manage to tie everything together towards the closing of the album. This album just keeps going. I'm not saying that it's a lengthy album, I'm just saying that it never brings everything full circle, it never comes together. The songs are seperate from on another while the music is not.It sounds like at first they recorded these songs on speed, then listened to them later while taking anti depressants and decided to re-record them at a slower tempo.It has a couple of good songs but no lasting memories."
2,Like a bridge over troubled Tarheels...,"I've read reviews comparing Kingsbury Manx with George Harrison, Simon & Garfunkel, and others, but this record is a pale substitute for any of the aforementioned artists' work. This record, while being mildly tuneful, is way too fey and pretentious for repeated listening. Only ""Piss Diary"" stands up well. Soft and sad isn't synonomous with depth and sincerity."
1,Absolutely horrible book,"If you're looking for poems as inspiration for a speech at a wedding, then run away from this book. All but two poems are pretty much worthless - they're depressing, uninteresting and quite frankly, have nothing to offer unless you want to wish the bride and groom an unhappy marriage.I was given this book to read by a friend who told me that after getting this as wedding present many years ago, she finally decided to read it and was horrified. Well, I can see why. Every poem makes me, as a single man, wants to make me grow old alone and warn others about marriage.The only value in this book is as a gag present. It's that bad."
2,Fell apart,"I bought this and thought it an excellent buy. The behind the ear design was great. Until the cord simply fell apart. It broke off at the place where the headphone and microphone cords split off. So... I bought another, thinking it a fluke. And presto, same thing happened. That is some bad quality right there."
3,Good quality but...,"The sound is great, it works. But, if you have long hair like I do, the neck thing is a no no. It is just not convenient to put on and off with long hair. Also, the way it sits on your ears is not convenient when you wear glasses !! the thickness of the branches + the thickness of the headset is not working for me. Aside from that it is good haedset !"
1,Labtec garbage,"Purchased this headset a few months ago, and the mic went within 60 days. The store I bought it from was really good but could only exchange the item for the same thing. I thought maybe I got a bum set. Within 3 weeks, the mic went on the second set.!! An absolute piece of garbage. My logitech headset far FAR exceeds the quality of this set. Dont waste your time or money on these!!!"
4,"It's not the technique, it's the logic behind it","Most evolutionary computation or math books deal with the techniques of solving problems. This book teachs you how to think of a solution for the problem you face, and not what problems are appropriate for the technique in hand.The logic is that when you do a craft work, you do pick the appropriate tool from your tools box, but you don't grasp a tool and then find a job to go with it, which is the case when you can only handle this tool."
4,"Interesting, but too long","I found the first 10 chapters well written and enjoyable to read. Each of the topics discussed is explained well and applied to the traveling salesman problem, boolean satisfiability or non-linear programming. A few chapters give psuedo-code, but most just give a high level description of how the technique can be applied. I think anybody with a deeper interest in the techniques would have no problem applying the information. If not, many references to additional information are given.After chapter 10 the focus seemed to shift and the text took a higher level approach, with fewer specific examples. The chapters on fuzzy logic and neural networks were interesting, but anybody wanting to apply them would need a different book. Towards the end a few sections simply list interesting results from research papers and provide references to them, barely covering the topics at all."
3,Kind of old stuffs,"The material is alright but it is just kind of old. I can not tell from the original description otherwise, I willnot have bought it."
5,Great,"Great for EMTs, Trauma shears, Mini Mag Light, pen, and a knife. You may have to remove the pen for wider knives though. With all that considered, definitely worth it."
5,Good fit,"The pouch is nicely made. No problems fitting a mini mag, 7 1/2"" scissors, rescue knife, and a pen snugly into this pouch. Keeps items together, in reach, yet out of the way, don't even notice when sitting, bending, and squatting."
5,Pre-Hospital Care,"I was first skeptical at this product, since there's not much information on it. I took faith in the other reviewer's responses and went for it.I'm happy to say its great!The horizontal configuration is well made, instead of just loops it's made with velcro, so one can strap it on a belt as tight as possible.The compartments, like the others said, are well made.I had one problem and that is my knife is to big, which doesn't leave much room for a penlight. Just to compare though, my knife is aGerber 31-000752 Bear Grylls Survival Series, Folding Sheath Knifewhich is pretty wide.All in all, its a great product, well made and worthy of day to day wear."
3,Not bad.,"You need to usually read several pages of a subject to find the info you're looking for in this book, but at least you don't need to read several chapters. No, it is not a hit list of functions, like one of the O'Reilly books, but it does cover a LOT of stuff useful to, yes, a beginner. I feel I have been able to move from the beginner category to a really advanced level in crystal with the aid of this book, over several months. Like I said, not bad, but you need patience. From reading some of the other reviews on this book, it seems like NOT knowing much about crystal makes this book seem a lot more useful."
1,Not so great,"As you become more and more proficient, this book is more and more frustrating. There are so many things just touched on and not explained or not in the book at all!"
3,Not much different than Crystal's own manual,"I purchased this book as a reference. Fortunately, I had a separate training course for learning the Crystal application. And I now teach the product.It's a good reference. I truly haven't had a question yet regarding basic or advanced procedures in the application that I couldn't find. But I would not recommend it for learning the application. It is dense.I'm also disappointed that it is not very different from the CR 8.0 manual published by Crystal Decisions. The layout and procession of the book are virtually the same! It could have included more tutorials, too.One thing that I would love for any CR reference/manual to include is a list and description of all the formulas in the system. To my knowledge, this does not exist anywhere, even in Crystal's own documentation.PURCHASING RECOMMENDATIONIf you need a solid reference and didn't purchase manuals with Crystal, this will work. If you need to learn the product, get something else."
2,Pathetic Index,"A reference book is only as good as its index. This book has a poor index. Example: Do you know that you want to use the Switch command in a formula but need the syntax, an example, and a couple words of wisdom? Give up. It might be in there but I don't have time to read the whole book to find out. Guess I'll have to limp by with Crystal's HELP. Anyone know of a good Crystal book that helps a guy when building formulas? I want syntax and examples for each function. I would like each function in the index. Where it belongs. Please :)"
2,"Poor Index, Missing key concepts, Garbage...","I frequently use these reviews to select books of all types. I consider myself a power user able to learn rapidly from good texts. This book has not been very helpful for my work in Crystal Reports.I need to be able to program Crystal Reports to perform a variety of complex reporting on databases that are completely denormalized. Thus, the ability to parse strings and execute stored procedures is critical.This book completely fails to provide the information about built-in commands that I need. For instance, no information about string commands is present. No discussion of the use of arrays in Crystal Reports is provided.I was deeply disappointed with this book."
3,"Good product, but poor quality","I like this trackball; it saves a lot of arm and wrist action compared to a mouse, and uses less desk real estate.However, the quality is just abysmal. My first one failed after a few months, and Kensington replaced it under warranty (shipping me a new one immediately, not waiting until I returned mine). My current one is getting ready to be returned, as the main button is starting to stick. The product looks and feels cheap, which is appalling given its price."
4,"Good for work, but pricey for home","First let me say that I love using a trackball vs a mouse. I have been using the Kensington trackballs for years. BUT I'm getting tired of replacing them every couple of years. It's OK for work where someone else is footing the bill, but at home I'm switching to a Logitech. I have a Logitech Marble FX for my laptop, and it has lasted longer than my Expert Mouse Pro. I just got the Logitech Cordless Optical Trackman for my desktop. It also has mulitple buttons that I can reprogram to do what I used to do with the Kensington. Maybe it will wear out given the usage my desktop gets, and if it does I may go back to Kensington, but I can buy 2 Logitechs for the price of one Kensington..."
3,A lackluster follow-up to the world's greatest trackball,"Kensington took way too long to come out with a USB version of their award-winning trackball, and when they did, this let-down was the result.The scrollwheel was an awesome addition - but you need to grow a 6th finger to use it... it should have been on the side for use by the thumb.The 6 buttons on the top are just fluff... a way to boost the price on the mouse, while not accomplishing anything beyond a click to your personal bookmarks in your Web browser. Ptooey.In order to follow suit with the trend of blue and other colored plastics, Kensington used this bluish plastic ball that has almost no traction whatsoever. You can spin the ball until you hit bone before you can move the cursor. I had to take the beige trackball from my older ADB Kensington mouse in order to navigate with this thing. Still a superior option compared to a standard mouse, this was a major let-down from the company that brought the best trackball on earth to Mac users."
1,Worked for less than 1 hour,Something is wrong with the design of this toy. The helicopter blades are supposed to spin when you press a button but after one try that was it. The blades never did spin again.Very disappointing. My son has not taken it up since.
2,Not what I expected,"I was looking for a book of Camelot/King Arthur stories written in fairly easy language for a student of mine. In particular, I wanted it to have nice illustrations with that feel of NC Wyeth pictures. When I looked at the pages in the online sample of ""Stories of King Arthur's Knights"" (Illustrated Edition) the illustrations were wonderful colored pictures with just the feel I was looking for. I was therefore surprised to get the book and find the pictures were black and white and just looked muddy. You couldn't easily distinguish what the content of the pictures was and certainly there was no ""old story book"" feel to them. I will say that Amazon was wonderful with the return process. It was quick and efficient."
3,A mixed bag,"This collection contains many of the old standards and a few I'd not heard before. The quality of performance varies markedly from track to track however. I've heard better renditions of the Pennsylvania Polka from Jimmie Sturr and Lawrence Welk. ""The Happy Wanderer"" is abysmal however, and will probably turn off all but the most avid fan. There is the occasional gem, like Dick Rodgers' ""Try It, You'll Like It"" polka, which is hilarious even though it's a bit thin on the vocals.This is certainly not a ""Best in Class"" recording, but it may serve to start you off on your Polka collection."
4,Good cd,My son love polka and square dance type music. But I even found some of the tune catchy. I am not what you would call a polka lover.
4,User Friendly and Informative Book,"I thought the file permissions chapter of the book went into good detail and helped me to get a better grasp on the concept and I understood how to set permissions of files and webpages on a website. I also read the online auction section of the book and I had my own online auction site running in a matter of just changing a few things and it was all automated! I really don't like reading monotonous text, but the author's personal approach to presenting subject matter made it easier for me to understand. With this perfect bound book, however, I would have preferred to have seen some sort of zip locking sleeve for the cd-rom that is included in the book. All in all, with filtering concepts and a lot of user friendly programs, I didn't realize that programming could be this easy."
5,Excellent,"I read this book about 2 and 1/2 years ago and when I read another book on some blessed or saint, I find myself a little disappointed that it lacks the rigourous analysis of Von Baltasar."
4,Great instrumentals,"The basic idea of Grateful Dead songs interpreted by a Celtic band and interspersed with traditional Irish numbers is terrific. The instrumentals are uniformly complex and wonderful, performed by highly skilled musicians. I love the way the music transforms itself--one moment it's an air or a reel, then suddenly, before you know it, it has become ""Scarlet Begonias"" or another Dead song. My one reservation is the vocals. Wake the Dead's lead singer's voice is pleasant but a little thin; it lacks the heartiness some of these songs require. Still, I'd love to hear the band live."
5,If you like the Dead...,"This irish acoustic disc puts an interesting twist on some tried and true Gratefule Dead classics. The different instruments blend well, and it can get good and spacey if you know what I mean."
5,MForce 2 in the one for me!,"A wonderful, heavy-duty work glove. Get it in a larger size than you think you might need."
5,Best edge-of-your-seat book I have ever read!!!,"This was by far the best suspense book I have ever read!! Fox has the reader guessing ""who done it"" and ""why"" throughout the whole book. Just when you think you know ""who did it"", it turns out to be the wrong person. Very complicated plot, which keeps the reader up all night, hoping for a happy ending."
4,scary book,Exciting and very scary. Especially if you have children. Twists and turns. Good beach read.
1,Oh please....,"If you are going to participate in a tribute album capacity, at least have your songs be a ""tribute"" to the artist! This disc is full of a bunch of garbage, pure and simple. *Way* too poppy, misdirected ""electronica"" made this almost painful to listen to. Do Trent a favor-do not buy into something that turns his music into something it was never meant to be-ugly."
1,BEWARE!,"This album doesnt even seem to have Trent's voice on it. Keep in mind that it is a ""tribute to NIN"", not necessarily an official NIN CD. Basically it sounds like some ""remix artists"" got their hands on Trents music and and mangled it into an obscene abomination of ""pop"" and ""dance"" music. BUY THIS ONLY IF YOU CANT STAND TRUE NINE INCH NAILS MUSIC! This CD corrupts the essential sound of Trent Reznors music. True NIN fans will be deeply and profoundly offended by this CD."
1,not a highly recommended cd,"Quite simply put...I bought the cd...I played the cd...I put the cd up for sale...no one will buy it.Overall I must say that this is a pretty bad tribute cd. I mean I give all the artists credit for trying, but that is about it. I personally liked only one of the tracks on the disc. Your taste may differ--but I urge anyone to listen to the sound samples before they buy. The music is less intense and much slower then the original songs. It sounds more like a club/techno/70's porno music cd. However, it is interesting to see how the different artists manipulate the songs, lyrics, and music. For any hard core Nine Inch Nails fan this is a piece to have in your collection, even though you may never want to listen to it!!"
3,Radiant Decay- Decaying excuses for NIN,"With the exception of about four tracks, this album is total crap. I'm sorry, guys, but when ""Suck"" starts to sound like a song you'd hear in some underbudget porno flick, it's time to turn the CD player off. Who invited some Michael Jackson wannabe to sing ""Piggy"", and just what the hell is that remix of Mr. Self-Destruct supposed to be? It sounds like a cat being fed through a garbage disposal unit. Perhaps if some other Industrial or techno groups did the mixes, but the producers obviously found some out of work garage bands to do it instead."
1,Huh!,I can't say much about this...just that it's a really really bad cd. Get the REAL stuff. At LEAST 50 times better. Don't be decieved by how this cd sounds. Try Downward Spiral. Try any other of their cds...just keep away from this one...
1,holy cow,I cant believe Trent would allow somebody to do this. Its awful! take it off the shelves! I'm truly glad when I listened to it that I hadn't paid for it.
1,...what?.....Okay.....this needs a zero.,"I never thought I would want to give something that has the words nine inch nails in it a zero. but this is just bad. When I saw this I was like""oh! nine inch nails! I gota have this! Weeeeee!"" When I listend to it I was sad,angry,and confused. REALLY CONFUSED! It just sounds like a bunch of 1st graders hiting a keybord wile filterd NiN songs play in the back ground. Stick with the real suff like Broken. I was never a real fan of remixes anyway. Buy broken insted of this pice of(booop! )"
1,What's The Point?,"Most of the tracks on this album sound like versions by disco lounge cover bands. Not too different from the original, but not good. The last 4 tracks of the album are at least a little more interesting. The version of ""Suck"" starts off interestingly with a singer with a soul style voice, but doesn't really go anywhere. ""Down In It"" is not a bad track if you are look for a ""club remix"" version of the song. The one standout track is ""Somehting I Can Never Have"" which features a really beautiful longing female vocal performance (I think I'm in love) and is marred only by the anoying iron-lung rhythm track. The version of ""Hurt"" is really aggressive, but loses all the emotional impact of the song."
1,More like a mockery of NIN,"This CD is really poor. Being an obsessed fan, I had to buy this as soon as I saw it, but even for a true fan, it is a great dissapointment. Some of the instrumental portions of the CD are rather good, but clash with the annoying voices of the singers, and they do not work at all together. Trent's voice seems the only one appropiate to sing his songs, but in order to still enjoy and respect NIN as much as you do, avoid listening to this ablum at all costs."
3,.......,"its not that great of a cd, but not TOTAL trash. The best songs are broke box's version of wish, and transient's versions of closer and sanctified. Most of the bands are WAY too poppy, and something i can never have is probably the most unorigional cover i've ever heard. Its some woman singing to the piano/synth, not NEARLY close to as good as the origional. I've got both radiant decay and covered in nails, and covered in nails is MUCH better. I'd say the only band really worth looking into because of the covers is transient, cause they use pop in the 2 songs, but they add electric guitars, and they are about the only band that was able to pull off a cool pop cover on the entire cd."
1,Completely bizzare,"Although the novelty of a NIN tribute album is nice to think about, it is not pulled off well in any way, and does not do justice to how good those songs really are (this is the only time a NIN song sounded bad). Its made using bands no one has ever heard of, the female singers sound like husky germans, and the male singers are whiny and annoying. This would have sounded soooo much better if they used bands people have heard of, that are talented. This is ONLY for the hardcore NIN fan, and even though, prepare for disapiontment"
2,If you are a hardcore NIN fan be prepared to be disappointed,"If I were to say that NIN was my favorite band, that would be the understatement of the century. So naturally I was excited to see this album sitting on the shelves. I popped it into my cd player and....I was so disappointed that I wanted to toss this cd into the nearest lake. The biggest cause for my disappointment was the version of ""Something I Can Never Have."" If any of you have heard this song before, you know it is made of pure, raw emotion. The pain that this song projects is nearly overwhelming at times. The version on Radiant Decay is sung by a woman with a little girl's voice, who might as well have been telling me what the weather was like, instead of singing about pain and loss. Some of the other tracks are ok, but I suggest you save your money and buy the real thing."
2,Decay Of Radiancy,"The album as a whole is not particularly good with most songs lacking diversity compared to the originals and one being completely unlistenable. 'Wish', 'Gave Up' and 'Closer' are all reasonable attempts, but do not drift terribly far from the much superior originals and hence do not represent a reason to buy this album. 'Sin' and 'Hurt', both by Tin Electric, are much heavier and respectable compared to the original versions. However, unless you are prepared to buy an album for just two songs, spend your money on some of the Nine Inch Nails singles, if you are looking for different versions of songs, or just save your money."
4,Different,"I like these versions of the NIN originals..they are supposed to be different and thats what i like about it...I actually like the remix of ""Hurt"" MUCH BETTER than the original cuz they speeded it up and made it more intense, the singer David Scott does a great job with this song."
5,An extraordinary book,John D'Angelico and John D'Aquisto have been two of the finest luthiers that have existed. Its guitars archtops are icons s.XX. This book reveals the human and professional face of these two great geniuses. With superb photos in color and b/w. One of the best books I have read on guitar. Fantastic.
2,Ok but you can still taste soap,The soap worked of but you can still taste soap on the fruit especially if you use it for raspberries or blackberries.I tried it twice using different ways to rince off raspberries (in warm water and in cold water)not change still slight soap taste.Please keep that in mind when you purchase the wash.
2,Smaller than advertised,"This is a preliminary review as we've just received this item. Just a warning that the diameter at the opening, the largest dimension one can report excluding handles, is 9-1/2 not 10-4/5. How hard it is to measure a pot and tell the truth? I could have bought the next size up."
2,It was not worth the money!,"I've had this pot now for a little over a month and I have to say I'm disappointed! It constantly stays ashy and isn't very easy to clean. The handles are too hot to touch when cooking. Finally, I should have paid closer attention to the size because it's not very big when it comes to making stews, etc. for a family."
5,Analon cookware,"This was an additional pan that I ordered to go with my set of Analon Advanced cookware. I love these pots and pans. The are so nice and heavy, easy to clean and nothing seems to stick to them. Another added bonus is that the handles don't get hot.Georgia"
5,"Sweet, sweet book.","I ordered this book before my daughter attended preschool but it only arrived a couple of weeks after she started since we have been relocated to China. I am sure there were other books I was reading and the Berenstain bears going to school dvd definitely helped but amongst it all, I highly believe that this book eased my daughter's fears the most about school. She related really well to the character (I named the character in the book after her) and this is definitely one of the books we have to read before bedtime on school nights. It is simple, sweet and straight to the point and I so wish this author has more books in this series about school. :) Excellent!"
2,Not the best but ok,I thought this book would be better - it is alittle negative - liked the Arthur preschool book better. Good illustrations though..
2,better books out there,"The setup of the book seemed odd to me...it is not set up for on the go reading. SOME directions, walking and driving, in this book are confusing at best, with draw-backs to earlier mentions in the book. The best part of this book, is the table of contents lists (best snorkeling beaches, best people watching beaches, best hike-to beaches); It IS very helpful for kayaking and hiking, just don't buy it for a stand alone guide."
1,Very disapointing; poor maps,"Like the other negative review said, I too bought this book based, unfortunately, on all the positive reviews this book had. This book, while written OK, has poorly detailed maps. The authors try to suggest that there chinsey road maps are sufficient as hiking maps! The only thing the road maps (there are no topographic or high quality trail maps in the book) do is point you to the approximate trailhead location. As a hiking book, this book fails terribly. I think by far a better trail tool I invested in was the Kauai Recreation Map from the Department of Forestry.However, the book does succeed in giving detailed written descriptions of the hikes (a rating of the scenic / difficulty of hike would have been nice). Written description's of hike / kayak areas are good, but lacking in where to go for rental companies unfortunately."
5,Googling Kauai,"Kauai Trailblazer covers alot of ground. It provides an organized way of accessing all the best things to do while you're there. It has the most complete index of any guidebook we've ever used. We spent a good month exploring this island and determining whether we wanted to eventually call it home. It's known as a hiker's guide but we were there long enough to realize it's packed with a good deal more. It includes all of Kauai's beaches, many that are off the tourist circuit and were worth revisiting. The photos are gorgeous and provide a visual tour before you get there. Caution: you might end up wishing you had booked an extra week."
5,Very Useful Guide,"My wife and I found this guide very useful for exploring Kauai. The book has very good details on places to hike, bike, snorkel etc and details about what to expect. The book is well organized by region of the island and has several useful indexes to quickly find things to do or places to go. We didn't use any of the food recommendations, etc from the guide. Yelp is more current and the better way to go for the best places to eat out."
5,Guided Through Paradise,"Having never been to the island of Kauai before, Kauai Trailblazer was exactly the type of guidebook that I needed to help plan two weeks worth of adventure in the Garden Isle. My main desire was to snorkle the beautiful water. With it being my husband's first time in Hawaii, I wanted him to see all of the amazing fish that I had told him about. Kauai Trailblazer pointed us in the right direction and we ended up snorkling the most amazing coves! With the book in hand, we hiked beautiful trails that led right up the sides of cliffs to amazing waterfalls and romantic pools. Having an interest in history, Kauai Trailblazer was also able to direct me to museums, landmarks and ruins. Our time in Kauai would have been less fruitful without the help of this book."
5,A great resource,"I purchased this book because of the good reviews by other people. After using this book in Kauai, I found everyone to be correct about their reviews. While visiting a new place, it is very easy to get lost. This book was a wonderful resource, with much to my surprise, very accurate and detailed directions and intructions on how to get to your chosen destinations. This guidebook described detailed landmarks to locate almost any of the sites for all the activities. My husband and family were able to participate in some of the recommended hikes and water activites and found them to be very enjoyable because we had a good idea of what to expect as described in the book. The book is organized and easy to follow for all the different activities with suggested ""do not miss"" establishments along the way. We will use this book again the next time we are in Kauai."
2,"Kauai Trailblazer: Where to Hike, Snorkel, Bike, Paddle, Surf","Unfortunately this book was not very helpful, the organization of the book made it very difficult to access information. On our first trip to Kauai, we used several guidebooks, and ""The Ultimate Kauai Guidebook: Kauai Revealed"" was the best of the bunch."
5,This is the only book you need,"For the traveller going to Kauai (one of the most beautiful places on Earth) for daily excursions that include hiking, biking, snorkeling, etc. this is the only book you need. We used it daily back in December for everything, including the information that was non-excursion related (eating, town info, etc.). This book came back stained by the red dirt/mud of Kauai, need I say more?!Looking forward to buying future editions with updated information as trails and beaches changes.Kudos to the authors for putting a truly usable piece of work together for visitors to this island.-AC"
3,brief descriptions lack detail,"While most of the entries have excellent descriptions on how to get there (driving/parking etc), I was disappointed with the lack of detail regarding the actual hike. Specifically, while trying to find more information on the Napali coast hike of kalalau (which is the first trek listed), I found a very brief 1 1/2 page rendition of the 11 mile hike. I was looking for specifics and found ambiguous answers. I had to read the paragraphs over five times in order to understand the order and/or meaning. I will definately have to do more research before committing myself to this hike. If you're looking for a quick guide book to get you someplace cool, this book should do it. If you're looking for trail descriptions mile by mile (like the PCT handbooks)- keep looking. And the maps mentioned are just rough guidelines meant to be used with an atlas."
5,Nicely organized for travelers,The authors have made it exceedingly easy to get around Kauai and find everything. What stood out for me was the chapter organization - - the maps prefaced the hikes in each region and were grouped with the trail gateway locations. They've included highway mile markers so their readers can countdown where to pull off the road and park. I also liked the interesting historical tidbits that they buried in the text. Also they haven't skimped on photos. This title has become my preferred book for getting around this island.
2,Kauai is great...this book is so-so.,"I too purchased this book because of all the great reviews on Amazon. It's true that it features many off the beaten track locations that most tourists would not normally find on their own. However, it strangely includes few maps, and the quality of the maps it does contain is poor. The written directions are often mysterious and hard to understand as a result. Was this done purposefully to make the destinations seem more romantic? I just found it confusing and time-consuming..."
4,My next home,"Have only made it partially through the book and am very impressed with the outline and the depth of knowledge of the subject. My wife and i are returning to PoiPou on the south shore at the end of April, 2008 and we are making daily plans from this book."
3,Review the book not the author!,"The BOOK is poorly written. PERIOD! This is to be an evaluation of the book not the author. Tom Watkins was a superior author, so the Tracker is a much more interesting read. How many times do we need to be reminded that he is a tracker in this book...I believe we know that..."
2,Disappointed overall,"I'm a huge fan of Tom Brown Jr., but this book would have been worth the money had it contained more details about actually tracking and not vague references. I suspect many people, like myself, went looking specifically for this book because we admire Tom Brown's skills and experience. We don't need to be reminded of that throughout the book in an almost insulting way. Compared to some of the detail that Tom's field guides contain, this book could have benefited from that so those of us who are novices could see practical application. As one reviewer said, I'd seek this out at the library and not waste money buying it. As I read the first story it kept reminding me of the Heart of Darkness (which was much better than Frankenstein). There was too much of a similarity for me."
1,Is Brown Insane or Merely a Liar?,"If you're going to gloss yourself as ""America's Greatest Outdoorsman,"" you should offer more to your readers than juvenile, New Age adventure stories. This book holds more snickers than the M&M; Mars wharehouse.Do people really take this guy seriously? His prose is leaden at best and his chest-thumbing goes well beyond the realm of satire. Tom Brown's writings are to serious tracking what Spider Man comics are to martial arts. ""My spirit sense told me he had been here....Only a person I had trained would be able to do that.""If you're looking for an honest read about tracking, there are scores of better authors out there. If you're looking for risible mumbo jumbo, laughable braggadocio, and a tenth-rate cloak and dagger yarn, then Tom's your guy!(Seriously, people literally and figuratively buy this excrement?)"
5,Spot On!,A wonderful coffee table/party book that can take conversations well into the long hours of the night. This book creates an easy way to get to know others and is fun in general!
3,Fun with my friends,"Whenever I have a moment or coffee with a friend, I share the page corresponding with their birthday. Each is asked to sign the side of the page and we reflect on how accurate the information is for them. Usually, we are surprised at how closely the assessment is for them and have fun discussing it. After a while, the book has begun to fill with birthdates I can easily use for reference.cc"
2,Birthday color,"I was expecting more than what it gave. I heard about it on TV, so maybe that influenced me."
1,Tree Wasting Non-book!,"It is amazing that this so called ""book"" was ever published. The colors are muddy and the names of the colors are often laughable! There is not one pure hue in the lot. The pages are not numbered but on the page of June she writes ""Mercury, the planet of communication, moves through the heavens during the month of June. WOW! I though it moved through the heavens all year long! The author claims she is a ""respected astrologer"". Respected for what, her cooking? Since computers have made the math necessary for astrology calculation assessable to the math challenged, many people claim to be astrologers. Buyer beware!"
4,Just As Stated,"Don't be disappointed if you expect a book that also includes astrological information to be in the forefront. This is, just as stated on the cover, ""what your birthday color says about you"" and nothing more. There is, beneath the full-page sample of your color, a couple two or three paragraphs about your personality, preferences, color partners. I've read their birthday color info to many of my friends and acquaintences, and we all seem to agree that it's worth picking up a copy. Simple, functional, fun for those interested in decorating, astrology."
1,only colors,I SEE THE BOOK IT'S EXPENSIVEFOR NOTHING YOU CAN HAVE THE SAME INFORMATION IN THE WEBSITE!!!!!yeah it's only color book you should take it if you want to paint your house because there a lot of good colorswith lack information'sand they repeat that if you wearing clothes color that the same from your birthday color you well be more sexy and bla bla blathat's mean i will wear the same clothes for all my life!!!!!!!i didn't like itit's worth 5 $ only
2,Biased Polemic for Slavery and the Antebellum South,"I'm sorry, but I couldn't finish reading this. Many who pine for the ""Old South"" say that the cause of the Civil War was NOT slavery. If you look at the primary documents - the states declarations of secession esp. - then you see that is bunk. I was researching actual documents to see what they said at the time.What made this book unreadable to me is the pro-slavery arguments. I have trouble reading them dispassionately, so I put it down. But if you want to see the rationalizations that the South gave for the Civil War, then by all means read this."
4,The Best Mary-Anne Book!,"Mary-Anne was one of the more appealing characters. I like the way she finally stood up to bossy, big mouthed Kristy and challenged Kristy on traveling abroad if she was planning to take a playground job in Stoneybrook. Armed camps square off -- it's Abby, Stacey and Kristy vs. Claudia and Mary-Anne. Don't worry, folks, it all gets sorted out in the end. Kristy in typical fashion runs off at the mouth and insults everybody. By the penultimate chapter, apologies are abound and the story is neatly concluded with everyone being friends again. (And yes, Abby, Stacey and Kristy DO travel abroad while the others remain stateside). A light, entertaining read."
2,Quick and Dirty Digital Lawyer,"Like its predecessors, Quicken ""Legal Business Pro 2006 (Contracts & Forms)"" is a legal advice and pre-filled form/contract generator. Powered by Nolo Press, the program is useful for those who need to rapidly create contracts and forms for all aspects of small (and I do put strong emphasis on small) business operations.Like its predecessors, Quicken LBP2006 has several e-books from Nolo Press, updated for this tax year. The e-books are typical Nolo Press books - well written, but not meant to replace the advice of a real laywer.I will note that I used a Confidentiality Agreement in Quicken, and sent it to a person. That person, in turn, took it to a lawyer who sent me a letter illustrating the loopholes in the confidentiality agreement, and strongly suggested not using Quicken for contracts.I believe that its good for small businesses, but for large accounts, run the printed form by corporate counsel - it already demonstrated to me that there are issues in the forms."
3,"Good, but there are better","My 3 year old loves the Backyardigans. This ""game"" is really a show/DVD. I want her to learn, which she has with the Dora game and the basic functions of the L-max. I wouldn't spend the money on this game if I had it to do over again. NOT worth it. It is cute, but NOT educational."
1,Should Have Read the Reviews First,"Just bought the Leapster 2 and Backyardigans for my soon-to-be 4-year-old. It did not hold her interest at all. It makes very little use of the stylus, which she loves to use.Most of the games on the cartridge involve the directional pad, which is more difficult for her to use consistently because it is very stiff. The games were quite boring (like hunting for items) and unlike other Leapster games, provided no assistance when she made repeated mistakes, leading to frustration. Also, the game has a lot of extended songs and cutscenes, and the sound is terrible. I agree with the other reviews that the game has a lot of fluff and little substance."
5,Backyardigan game,Im pleased to say that the shipping was quick! Two days after I placed the order! Also in brand new wrap as it was brand new! My son is going to be so excited when he sees the game he can learn from!
4,"Notable writing skills, not very interesting story.","The story is not that interesting and though it is pretty traumatic, the shock is somewhat lost in the telling.The villains are discernible mostly by default, and some attitudes by the characters are unrealistic. The peripheral situations, such as the one that gives the book its name and some departures from the main story make no difference to it and could have been left out; the book drags a bit as every chapter is a flat advancement of a story that fails to stir feelings of identification or compassion. The end is more dynamic and closes well.This is a skillful writer and a more rigorous editing with a view to making the book shorter would have helped greatly."
4,"Professional Library ""must have""","This book is a great one-stop reference for engineers and designers involved in water distribution or piping networks. The topics are covered in sufficient detail, and if more information is needed, the relevant source is usually listed (e.g. AWWA publication # xxx) so the in-depth source can be found quickly."
1,Will not record DVD,"Ordered a HDMI cable and that did not work, was told by Cable company I needed a S-video Cable, that did not work. a cable man said I needed a component but he never returned. I cannot get my DVD to record, what now ?"
2,makes annoying noise during operation,"This DVD has some problems: (1) extremely annoying continuous noise during operation, (2) big, bulky remote control, and (3) the unit itself looks unfashionable. I will be probably returning it."
4,Not bad for starters.,"This is a very basic DVD Recorder. It doesn't have a ton of bells and wistles which is what makes it perfect for beginners. The lack of DVD-ram is upsetting, considering the DR-W4 is only thirty more for many more features, but sometimes less features are nice, the simplicity makes it easy for my entire family to use. You cannot access menu items when discs are finalizing/formatting/or even when shows are recording, which is unfortunate. Otherwise, it is a great starter by a company that makes reliable products."
4,"Best value to watch ""Death Hunt""","A great movie (""Death Hunt"") with a lot of authenticity for the period; excellent acting except for Angie (who never could act anyway). This story takes some poetic license from events which occurred in Canada in the '30's; read the book if you want a more accurate version. ""Butch and Sundance"" is 3 Stars; not a great story, but at least the actors look a lot like Paul and Robert as younger men."
4,Bought this for one of the movies,"The movie Death Hunt was the movie I was after when I purchased this. It is one of the two favorite Charles Bronson Movies of mine. For some reason, my favorites are more difficult to find than his other movies. The Butch and Sundance is an OK movie for a ""B"" side as we used to call it with 45 rpm vinyl records. It wasn't what I bought the DVD for but it is watchable and has a couple of entertaining parts. I just wish I could find Death Hunt in Blue Ray or on DVD in the 16:9 version."
4,Lonesome Dove (the outlaw years),The DVD was very good but what kind of ending was THAT THE ENDING SUCKS
3,Somewhat disappointed,"This DVD left a lot of questions to be answered. When an episode would end, there were a lot of questions left unanswered. EX: What happened to the boy who was saved from hanging and others? The most disappointing was at the end. What happened to Newt, the gunsmith, the rest of the main cast??????????????? What is the sequence to this saga????????"
2,lonesome dove the outlaw years,after watching the original lonesome dove with tommy lee jones and robert duvall the outlaw years is very poor. the acting is poor and the storylines are not much better
1,This entertainment offering deserves 0 stars,"This episodic presentation of the Lonesome Dove theme is pure Hollywood, formulaic drivel. As far as a coherent, overall story line running from the beginning of episode one and through each show like that in the original Lonesome Dove series and its sequels, this weekly series tries to present each show as a complete story all its own.The cast of characters lacks the true western ambiance of that time. Some are so artificial and transplanted appearing they are laughable. The show tries to make a big deal out of how muddy the streets are, but the gun store owner's always perfectly coiffured hair do, antiseptic cleanliness, and unblemished complexion make a mockery of the true character of the people living under those harsh western conditions.This mediocre series is not worth one penny of your money and not worth even one star, IMO."
3,bought it on a whim,"I love New Order and Monaco. Thought I'd try this, even though I never heard anything from them. It's not bad. I'm glad I added it to my collection. I like the different mixes."
4,"Fit like OEM, but it is made in China.","I used this for a 1996 Chevy C3500 with 5.7 gas engine and NV4500 transmission. Despite being ACDelco it is made in China, other then that, it did fit and work properly."
5,What a Ride!,"I discovered Mr. Franz many years ago and have been a devoted fan ever since. His writings, which includes novels, novellas, countless short stories and poetry are some of the scariest I've ever read. If you're like me and love to be spooked, I highly recommend this book. In my opinion, his talent is up there with the likes of Stephen King and Richard Matheson. Don't be surprised if you see one of his books on the top seller's list some day.I also recommend his alarming novella, ""Jack Frost"" also sold by Amazon. So, get a hold of his stories, curl up on a dark and stormy night and let Mr. Franz take you on journies you'll never forget. Warning! Side affects may include goosebumps, trembling and nightmares!Mina"
5,Nice Pack,"I'm very happy with this back-pack. It's not too big, not too small, just the right size for hiking or biking. A mesh pocket on each side to carry water bottles are handy too. -Mike G."
1,Still wondering about those ghosts,"The video ""Castle Ghosts of England"", while interesting in location shots and narration, was a disappointment to us. As we prepared for a trip to England we thought this could help to guide our travels and add interest to the trip. We expected more substance (maybe that was unrealistic - substance in a ghost film?) and excitement. One of the features was quite interesting in that it yielded witness accounts and reflected on scientific testing that had been done. The others were generally one person's account of something that happened and the accounts were rather unemotional and disappointing."
2,Haunted,"A lot of people believe in ghosts; I am not alone. It was said a holy man of faith could rebuke ghosts and other undead with the flashing of a cross, but only by a man of faith."
5,Great chopsticks,This is a great set of chopsticks. Very easy to clean. My 3-year-old is learning how to use chopsticks and she thinks the stainless steel color is more fun than wood.
4,Great because they don't roll around like other metal chopsticks,These are great because they don't roll around like other metal chopsticks I have used. They have a slightly square shape but are very comfortable to hold. My only issue with them are there are no grooves at the tips to give better grip to food like others. I would recommend them for sanitary reasons alone.
3,Definitely not Korean style.,"I've been to Korea many, many times and not once have I ever seen rounded chopsticks. Not at restaurants and not at Korean homes. That said, these are very lightweight (read: completely hollow), but sturdy. I've had these chopsticks for over two years now and they're still in decent condition. I find that I prefer the true Korean style chopsticks--flat ones."
3,These elegant chopsticks expose my mediocre technique,"Like other reviewers have pointed out, the fact that these are stainless steel chopsticks is precisely what makes them a bit harder to use (because they are more slippery!) than wooden chopsticks. Seems obvious now, but I didn't think about it before placing my order. If you are skillful, then consider this a challenge. You will look cool using these. I do not."
3,Neat but Noisy,"I got these for my husband who has a thing for steel. I like them, and use them for all kinds of things. They don't get much use as chopsticks though, as he objects to the noise they make on my particular breed of plate."
4,Very cool product,I bought these for my niece and everyone loved them. Some people told me I should get bamboo but I like durability and cleanliness of stainless. Turns out all the young adults thought they were very cool and asked where I got them.
4,Feel and look good,"These are well made but I find I don't use them a lot. Instead, I use the wooden or bamboo ones. I think it's the psychological fear of biting on something hard or perhaps it's just resistance to change."
4,charming chopsticks,"These chopsticks are quite nice and very reasonably priced! Not sure if they are labeled 'dishwasher safe' or not, but I put them in my dishwasher and they do well. Just take precaution, as they easily can slip through the silverware basket, so I put a little cup it the basket first."
5,Chopsticks.,"Very nice, but, don't be fooled. Not the same as the ""Yoshikin"" global line. And it works. You can eat with them and or even use it as throwing sticks; with some practice of course."
3,They're......OK,"I bought these to go with a Zojirushi lunch container. I thought that the stainless steel chopsticks would be cool to use with it. While they do indeed work, I prefer more traditional wooden chopsticks to these. Being metal and slick, they are a little more difficult to use. Plus, I don't like the *clink* *clink* noise they make while you are eating.The good thing about them, however, is they come clean very easily. No worries about something soaking in and making you sick."
5,functional and beautiful,"They match very well with my silverwares, and are just as easy to use as wooden chopsticks, in fact, more sanitary."
3,OK chopsticks,"made in China with no indication of metal composition in the labeling, these 'stainless' chopsticks had no discernible flaws and all edges were smooth... although they did not taper to as fine a point as i would prefer or have graduated ringed tips, these implements should serve well for much longer than bamboo or lacquered chopsticks...after various attempts to use these with noodle soups, my recommendation is to NOT purchase these; instead, get ones with graduated, ringed tips (i found a set locally for less than the items here) - they will work *much* better than smooth-tipped sticksupdate: a quick fix is to use your Dremel with a blunted cutting wheel to put in your own graduated rings - took me about two minutes to do two pairs - all you need is a steady hand and a gentle pressure - now the sticks work just fine for slippery foods - problem solved"
5,Great Value & Stylish,"I bought these on a whim just for something different. I wasn't sure how often I would use them but ended up loving them, I use them every chance I get. They're about the same as plastic when it comes to picking up food. The best thing about them is they have yet to rust in the four months I've had them, and here in Hawaii that's a huge plus!"
5,Good Set of Chopsticks!,"We love these Chopsticks! They take a little getting used to because they slip when you hold them compared to the wooden kind, but they slide on your lips easier, are easier to clean, and look nice. They also are much more light weight than I expected them to be. I'd recommend these."
4,Different... and better in some ways,"These stainless steel chopsticks are great in a few ways. They're light weight, can be washed in the dishwasher and made sterile, won't lose their enamel over time and look really cool.They are a little bit more loud, and depending on the plates you're using, the clanking can be a little more annoying. Also, they are pretty slick and can be tricky for more slippery kinds of foods, like noodles.I like them and will use them in conjunction with my traditional chopsticks."
5,"good product, very glad I bought them","I like these a lot. They are very easy to clean, and have the same weight as the traditional bamboo ones. I didn't consider light-weight to be a negative.They are quite a bit slicker than the traditional chopsticks and do require a little more effort with some types of food. I have no problem eating noodles with them, rather, I find it a little more difficult to pick up heavier pieces of food, such as ribs. But after a little practice, I got used to it.I have not experienced the problem with them heating up too quickly. In fact, the noodles I ate were a lot hotter than the chopsticks that I used to pick them up! I also used these chopsticks to cook the noodles, and did not notice the temperature change at all. The key I think is to use them to stir the noodles but not to leave them in the pot, which I never do even with the bamboo ones.Overall I am very satisfied with these. I may buy some more."
4,The Best Accessory For Chinese Food,"I originally bought these to round out a $25 supersaver shipping offer. They are lighter than I expected and I was afraid they wouldn't ""grip"" to the food well (like wood sticks would). I was pleasantly surprised at how well the chopsticks worked. Easy to use and clean, and for this contemporary kitty they are also stylish."
4,$8.95 and more user friendly than Joyce Chen's steel chopsticks,"These sticks aren't ringed on the lower end. However, these might be slightly better as well as slightly heavier."
2,Great Idea,"Stainless chopsticks sound like a great idea, but they just don't work very well. They're hard to eat with because they're slick - noodles especially just slide right off (and I know how to eat with chopsticks; no problems with other kinds). Also, they get way too hot when you eat hot foods.I wouldn't buy them again. The dishwasher-safe thing doesn't mean much if they are never used."
2,Good product but not what was pictured or what I wanted,"I only ordered this set of chopsticks because of what the Image showed of them, What I was looking for are grips that are squared like in the image and with tips that have large blunt ends like most Chinese style wooden chopsticks I've seen again like the image shows. What I got was chopsticks with more rounded grips and slim tapered tips with ridges exactly like the Joyce Chen Stainless Steel Chopsticks witch I can get here at any food supply store and have a few sets of all ready. So I'm kinda of disappointed at wasting my time and money. with theses."
2,"Pretty, but useless.","These chopsticks are very sophisticated in style, until you try to use them. They're very light, and not well-balanced, so handling them just comes with skill. The ends are rounded and slick, making it very near impossible to pick up many foods, especially lo mien. I find myself trying to pick at my food more than actually eating it."
3,dishwashable but too light,other people had mentioned the lack of weight as an issue-I didn't think I would care...but I do. They feel cheap
5,love them,"I like how they can be easily washed. I use them all the time, except when I eat noodles. Since the noodles tend to slip off."
2,Not what the picture shows,"There are many vendors for stainless steel chopsticks, but I bought these ones specifically because they are supposed to have the smooth finish on the end which picks up food, while most of the stainless chopsticks seem to be ridged on that end. So I was very disappointed when I got these and found that they were the ridged kind.Not only that, but if you look closely you can see that the craftsmanship is not all that good (the handle doesn't look well polished).To top it all off, they came 3 weeks later, which is way later than I normally expect from an item purchased from Amazon. I realize they ship from Singapore, but gee, that is a long time to wait. So if I were you, I would try to buy these from somewhere else."
2,Not as picture show,"The chopsticks i received were not as the picture shows. They do not get thinner at the end, they keep getting thinner all the way down, on a constant base.The ones i got also have some chinese ideograms, not plain as the picture shows. I use them, but they're not what i supposedly bought.Not a fair transaction."
3,not sure it is 18/10 stainless-steel chopsticks.,"Just got them. but from the package, there is no sign about ""18/10 stainless-steel chopsticks"". Very simple package."
2,Not Global the Knive Company,These are cheap plastic crome plated that have a bad weight. I bought since I thought it was made by the same people that make those great knives that I love. Junk
5,Goodbye Wooden Chopsticks!!!!,These chopsticks are really great! They are lightweight and clean up quickly with soap and water. Get involved in saving the environment. Take them along with you when you eat out. Just think of all those trees you will be saving!
2,Fuzzy,"This is nothing but a USB to ADB adapter, which is analogous to those USB to PS/2 adapters which sometimes accompany Wintel mice, plugged into a USB mouse with a cheap and cantankerous cord. As Kensington warned me, it doesn't work with the Apple IIgs ADB port. I plan to try the adapter with some other USB optical mice to see what results. If one wants an optical mouse on a classic Mac with ADB, this will be the only alternative (the MacAlly mouse is opti-mechanical). Mac owners with PCI slots in their CPUs will probably be better off installing a compatible USB card."
2,Warning this mouse contains lead,"This was replacement from the company because I old one didn't work well at all.On the back of the packaging there's a sticker added to the back of the instruction manual which says something about lead in the mouse cord and that California recognizes this as a health hazard and to wash your hands after touching the mouse cord etc...it's a great mouse but their previous MIB didn't have this problem. I would give it a five but because of this lead issue I won't.Lastly, it doesn't fit a regular Macintosh Keyboard because the adapter is too long. It can only be used on a Mac pro keyboard. crazyanyone know where i can get an old MIB?"
3,Cannot provide a useful review,This product was never actually shipped because they were out of stock by the time my order processed through and now I cannot find a viable supplier that isn't overcharging for the product.
2,Reeds 2007,I received the book quite quickly after I've ordered it!Also the books is starting to fall apart now! I'm only using it at home and not on a boot. On a boot it would have been one big pile of loose pages I'm afraid...
4,pretty good,"a good mix of european music makes this cd not a bad choice if you like everything. however, with 84-some-odd songs, you get only little very short samples. i'd recommend chartmix V over this newest edition."
4,Cool stuff!,The CD is a must to buy! It is a good mix trough many styles of Music! The Chartmix Aera will be continued i hope! This CD's are real good stuff!
1,Avoid this item,"I ordered this tripod, and it arrived broken.The assembly to which a camera is attached is made out of plastic. I asked for an RMA order via E-Mail, and they only gave me an address to mail it back to with a 'copy of the invoice.'Being lazy about mailing things back, and since it was cheap to begin with I tried repair it myself. Where it broke (the three plastic rings on the camera mount), it was impossible to re-glue, because of the torsion placed on those rings with any sort of pressure.Even if your tripod arrives un-broken, it will likely break the first time you drop it on the camera mount from any height at all."
1,poor design,"the design of the connection between the tripod adapter and tripod is poor, the plastic cannot hold the weight of my 15x70 binoculars and caused damage to both binoculars and tripod after using only one week. although it's cheap, it still dont worth the price."
1,Celestron Tripod,"I purchased this product to use with the Celestron binoculars. Assembly was straight forward and it does the job. However, with heavy binoculars the stand will vibrate if touched and takes a minute or two to stabilize. I plan to rebuild it with much sturdier legs and bracing. For the price it isn't bad, but it is far from being a stableplatform for easy viewing."
1,Junk,"This tripod lasted two days after Christmas. This tripod should not be used to support the Celestron Skymaster 15x70 no matter what Amazon or Celestron may think. The Celestron Skymaster Binoculars are very happy to shear plastic quick release clean off. This tripod features mostly plastic construction and comes with sparse instructions in many languages. Just go ahead and buy the next tripod up from Celestron unless you are a fan of all plastic construction. People get what they pay for so go ahead and say, ""I'll be careful with it"" and bust it clean off some night under the stars. I'm glad I'm out only 33 dollars. This tripod is not covered by the no fault binocular warranty for good reason."
5,Incredible Bargain,"I had purchased the VistaPix IS70 digital spotting scope w/ digital camera thinking I could use it like a regular camera. As it turns out, not a good idea. I now needed the tripod that is recommended for taking pictures. Great, another expense I had not counted on. Amazon to the rescue. I purchased the tripod used at less than half the cost of a new one. WOW, is all I can say. I'll swear it was brand new and an incredible bargain. I purchase used whenever I can and you can't tell me it's not new. Thanks again Amazon."
5,TDK 74mb/80 min. My MAIN source of burning media.,"I saw a photo of this on amazon, so I couldn't resist. It's EXACTLY what is on my headboard on my bed in my room right now. I don't do too much burning any more, but for what I do use it for, I use these discs. I've used about 1/3 of the spindle, and they have not failed me yet. These are also BLUE-bottomed discs...which are the best in my opinion. They are heavily scratch resistant, and they look cool and bring you back to the days of only 4x media. I've used other TDK products in the past, and I expect the rest of the spindle to be no different. TDK stands alone as one of digital media's best sources for quality sound and trustworthy media."
5,"TDK tops in tapes, now tops in CD's","When technology for recording was the cassette tape, TDK was the best, especially the ""metal"" bias tape. Now the CD is the music recording buff's method of playing ""Master Mixer."" Stick with TDK, the music will last for decades."
4,"good, but...","Of course, being an ElfQuest fan, I love pretty much everything ElfQuest, including this book, and so will you if you like ElfQuest in general.However, this is the paperback/black and white edition-don't buy it! Warp and Marvel comics are coming out with hardback, color editions of I believe all of the ElfQuest storyline, just slightly re-organized from the last hardcover/color edition of their graphic novels that they released- heads up, don't go paying fifty bucks online for someone's used old copy! Unless you're really impatient don't go buying this! The next one to be redone in color and hardback should be #3! They've done 1 and 2!Although it will be more expensive that way, if you're going to bother getting into something that is primarily a visual medium, why not in color as it was meant to be seen? Nothing ""artistic"" about this kind of B&W;, it just loses."
3,A good place to start,I am a second year medical student with an interest in surgery. After having attended several suturing workshops I was looking for a way to practice while at home. This book is a good way to practice the basic ties. It has pretty good descriptions and drawings to help aid in learning suturing techniques.
4,Not a Bad Place to Start,"As a second year medical student with an interest in surgery I have had the chance to attend many suturing workshops at my medical school. However, I wanted to be able to practice on my own at home during my free time. This book is a good place to start. It shows some of the basic one and two hand ties as well as some instrument tying. Included in this are Miller's knots, continous running, vertical and horizontal mattress, intradermal, and others. Included is a very good review of proper technique also."
3,Fun but not the best Rescue Hero toy,"I am not sure why but this is not one of my son's favorite Rescue Hero items. I know there used to be another snowmobile in the Rescue Hero line that looked just like a snowmobile. I think my son has a hard time with this toy because it isn't very realistic. He knows you ride a snowmobile, not stand up. I wish they would bring back the older style which is now discontinued.....that was what a snowmobile should be. This is just a cheap version to me which is surprising from Fisher Price. I would rather pay a few more dollars and have something that is of better quality and is what the title says ""snowmobile"". This isn't the worst toy out there, but it doesn't get the play time that other Rescue Heroes he has do. There are many others in the Rescue Hero line that are much more fun and worth the money spent."
2,not what expected,"I got this for a friend that is into snowmobiles, I was disappointed in how little it looks like a snowmobile, and how few things it does"
2,There is better,"I thought this book would help me learn Java when I first bought it, but I think the examples are skimpy. A more complete reference and tutorial is Cay Horstman's and Gary Cornell's 7 ed. of Core Java 2: Volumes 1 and 2. These 2 volumes have great examples, and go more in-depth into Java. Skip Schildt's book, and buy the Core Java Volumes even if you need just a reference. You will be happier, and learn more."
3,Not complete at all,"If you're a beginner, this book can help you... However, if you intend to learn data structures and algorithms such as sorting and searching, then you'll be out of luck with this book. You'll definitely need another reference bcos you'll only learn about the java util methods which would most likely not be accepted if you're learning java formally. You can get some useful information from this book though. It's very good with the basics."
4,As good as Sonic Youth,"This underrated album stands with the best of the Sonic Youth albums - Daydream Nation, Sisters, Murray Street... As one reviewer points out, this is an uninterrupted stream of Thurston songs, no Kim Gordon, etc. This is not a bad thing - I can get my Kim Gordon fix from the many Sonic Youth albums available."
2,If Sonic Youth had no other members,"Fortunately for us, Thurston Moore IS in the groundbreaking Sonic Youth. Unfortunately, he chose to release this boring solo album."
5,Good deal,Very nice non-stick casserole. I already using to make sauces and for braising and had no problem with sticking or cleaning or or peeling.
5,Enjoying cooking again,"I have a smooth top stove. This cookware has worked the best for me.It heats fast and consistent. Clean up is easy. Little heavy, but tolerable with arthritic hands.I cooked with my daughter's cookware, of the same quality, and I learned the difference first hand.First came the 12"" fry pan, than this stockpot. I have recently purchased the 3 1/2 qt pot."
5,Worth the Price,"The price. That is the question! I was lucky to buy this 2-CD set in 2007 or 2008 when it ""only"" cost about $42. It is a truly rare CD that is worth the high price.This set is a great introduction to early music and its special instruments. It also contains some of the wonderfully spirited recorder playing of the late great David Munrow. Did he play with the technical perfection of others like Frans Bruggen? No but there is a joy in his playing that IMHO Bruggen never achieved before abandoning the instrument.In a collection this size, there are a few clunkers, of course. But in this age of the MP3 player, we can pick and choose our favorites. Of the top 25 played items on my iPod, five come from this set."
2,its ok,"i am kinda disappointed with the quality of the strap. but for $10 something, what can you expect.. its just thinner and ""cheaper"" than i thought. it works tho, so its ok"
4,A simple but effective tome,"Meant as a textbook, this book provides an entry-level discourse on the problems of the concept of god. Concentrating on the classical arguments of Aquinas and Anselm, Mr. Angeles points out weaknesses and logical holes in their works. The problem with this book is that it refutes the classical arguments for theism without engaging in more recent, and more sophisticated, apologetics. It is good as a primer, but better move on to Michael Martin and Theodore Drange to see how far Philosophy of Religion has advanced."
3,Perhaps a Little Too Much Keyboard,A single one hour track of gentle rain with some peaceful thunder and keyboard only music. Although it is only a single track the music stops in points and restarts. The music changes and there are some birds and more gentle rain and other rain types in areas. It is nice if you like rain and some keyboard sounds. Very relaxing but only for background sound while working. Sounds as if this was a recording of an entire rain storm start to finish with lots of different rain types.
5,A must -have for music fans,This DVD is fantastic. They feature such a diverse range of artists. Nobody else would even think of featuring the Residents! Sound quality and video quality get an A+!
1,This Company Is Doing To Much Business To Need Anymore of My Money,I bought text books for Christmas so my daughter wouldn't have to shell out massive amounts that stores like this over charge for them. I got the wrong book and was told this company has a 7 day return policy and never on workbooks. Thanks a lot and Merry Christmas to you to.
1,DVD Qualitly Poor,"The quality of this DVD was extremely poor. It looks like this DVD was mastered using a VHS tape. There is an excessive amount of distracting video noise, the titles all ""dance"" because of poor resolution and you can even see banding in the dark scenes (And there are plenty of dark scenes). The menu is virtually unreadable and amateur at best.For those wanting to see great black and white cinematography of the 40's, don't buy this DVD."
2,More DVD-R product,"Ho hum. Another DVD-R transfer being listed on these pages, giving the impression it's the genuine article. Now we discover Warners is about to release same film in a pack with 3 others, including Karloff's ""The Walking Dead"", ""Frankenstein 1970"" and Lugosi's ""Zombies on Broadway"". I bought this DVD under the impression it was an authentic version. C'mon, Amazon... take some steps to get rid of the DVD-R pirates who solicit through your website.."
3,A biased but alternative view,"Wall Street is a moderately informative, highly opinionated piece of writing. It's a refreshing book to read because it takes as its premise (and its tone) that the financial industry is morally abhorrent and parasitic. In places the author goes even further and takes a few swipes at capitalism in general. This sets it apart from most other books in the genre. But frankly it goes to far. The book is too one-sided in its presentation to be useful as a learning tool, and reads much more like an op-ed piece than reporting"
2,"Wall Street exposed, but biasly","The book reviewed many of the major workings and problems with Wall Street and how they came about. The author exposed many faults in the capitalistic system of ""fund sucking"", but did so in a very bias way. He attacked economic theorists in a way that lost track of how they related to the topic: Wall Street. He did not differentiate between his own factual research, and that of his biased opinion. This writing truly shows he is no author, but still a journalist."
3,Fairly typical SVH teen romance fare.,"Penniless outcast Roger ignores his loyal ""friend"" Olivia, while pining for snobby Lila. A scholarship race offers a chance to qualify as a suitable boyfriend for the girl of his dreams, but how can he run without losing his job and displaying his poverty?Fairly standard SVH romance attempts to deal sensitively with the problems of poverty-stricken kids at school. One of the better volumes."
3,A Big Change for the Series....,"This is a Land-Mark SVH Book because it is the First to Revolve around Other Teenagers at Sweet Valley besides Jessica and Elizabeth...Other than that, it was an okay book."
4,Why?,"Why does Roger like Lila? He barely ever talks to her, and she always puts him down. (The romance in this book is similar to that in #8) The part besides that, him having to deal with a cruel boss, and his friends helping him out is really good. I'm glad they talked some sense into him."
3,it is good,I feel bad for roger considering he has always had a humongus crush on Lila . But she has never felt the same passion for him at all. She liked to make fun of him and laugh when ha slipped or tripped. Then a big race came and roger decided to run. He won not only first but Lilas heart. She was kissing his shoes pretty much. Then he finds out who his true love is and that lilas a fake. Will he win th final race? Will his true love still want him too?
4,Every Bokken might be different quality,I have ordered 1 of these bokkens in the past and i have to say it was the best bokken I had and lasted me a good 5-7 months until my cousin decided to hit a tree with it. I just ordered 2 more bokkens and got them today. Didn't come with a scratch or anything. They also didn't come with the tsubas and they felt a bit different. I decided to test them and one of the bokkens cracked in a couple minutes. I tend to hit really hard with my bokkens but today i barely tried. The first bokken I ordered lasted many beatings and sparrings and even survived most of my hard hits. Anyways I just think every bokken from this seller tends to be in different quality and conditions.
1,Go with Oak,"One sword was cracked at the tip making it sharp. I sanded it down to make it safer before passing it on as a gift. I'm still a little wary of wood that breaks off so easily at sharp angles for a training bokken. That, said, the weight is much lighter than oak reducing the worry of broken ribs."
4,Nice practice sword for a really great price.,Bought this sword to practice and workout with. Is a great find for the workout or just collecting enthusist of Japanese-inspired equipment. The sword is nicely made and handles well. It comes nearly ready to use right out the box and looks good. The only drawback is the fact that the guard for the sword is not attached at requires some ingenity to attach properily and to stay attached.
3,Needs super glue,"I really liked it, however it came banged up in a flimsy package, so watch out for that. One thing you should know is that the seperator, from the wooden blade part and the handle, does move around when using it. This part is made out of rubber and slides around. It is not secured."
1,Not what pictured,The image for the product clearly shows a guard on the sword. There is none on the sword I received. I could have ordered elsewhere if I didn't want the guard. Here is the description:Product DescriptionThis is the Katana Length Wooden Bokken Practice Single Sword. The bokken is constructed from wood with a Red glossy finish. A cotton wrap has been wrapped over the handle of the sword. The Bokken is Katana length. A plastic guard and securing ring are included with the bokken.
3,OK for the Price,"This is an ok practice product. Don't imagine you will be getting a work of master craftsmanship. The main marvel here is that mass produced components could be jammed together in the form of something roughly useful. Forget about the plastic hand guard, by the way. It doesn't fit. And the edge on the wooden blade is so rounded that only sheer bludgening force could make it useful in a real fight....Which, I suppose, is one of the functions of a practice sword. But then, if harmlessness is really the point, wood would hardly be the ideal material.It's heavy, I'll give it that.Overall, my impression of this produce is, it's cheap. Not 'bad', though."
1,"Dont buy, BREAKS EASILY!!!","I have recently purchased two of these swords, one for my friend and one for me. We were, and still are, intrested in sword fighting and this seemed like a great product. Right after we received these bokens we decided to give it a light trial, meaning no hard hits. Both of our bokens are now broken in half and we did not spar but for maybe a minute or two. if you are just intrested in hanging one of these items on your wall it is perfect, it looks great but, however, if you are like me and prefer to spare with someone I do not recomend this item."
1,Get what you pay for,Disappointed with this bokken. The finish is rough. The wrapping of the tsuka is glued poorly and was coming loose after only a few minutes of use. The good news is it didn't cost very much. I guess you get what you pay for...
1,Not good at all,"Its way to heavy , not balanced , the shape it looks backward , what supposed to be the ""sharp"" part is thicker than the what supposed to be the back of the blade of course there is no sharpness because is a training sword but still pretty bad , if I knew was like this I won't take it not even for free.Also it didn't bring the guard plastic thingy. Expensive too . what a rip off ."
2,You get what you pay for...almost,"Bokken is flimsy and looks as if it will break easy, and the laquor will scrape off. I have three other ""real"" bokken and this doesn't compare at all to those.I would not recommend using this in any real practice. All show, no go.Great big ""made in China"" sticker on the box too."
2,Not very strong,"I know it is a practice sword, but it couldn't hold up to moderate practice. Sword broke about eight inches from the tip - looked like flaw in the wood"
1,A pretty piece of trash.,"I bought this a week or so ago for my little brother to give to him on X-mas and well, I'm actually pretty ashamed to even wrap it. It came looking like it was spray painted red, with missing paint, gashes, and bubbles all included. It looked like someone took a knife to it and just went mad. There were slices all up the wooden shaft and it had glue showing through the very poorly wrapped handle. It's just plain ugly and I'm so upset with the quality of this thing. It's not like I expected some handcrafted piece of treasure, I mean it's only eleven dollars but I've paid only a little more for ones that were ten times better than this. I guess I've learned my lesson.I definitely wouldn't reccomend this product.Especially as a gift unless you're looking for people to have the impression that your as cheap as the dirt outside your door."
3,Bokken,"Well it was very good for practice but when i got it, it hada crack at the end so their always is the chance of that happeningotherwise the grip and hand guard worked very well i just wish ithad been less sharp on the end because when i was practicing i cutmy friend and he has a big scar on his arm now."
5,What i needed,Exactly what I was looking for to practice with and play around with. Meet everything I needed and more. Came in really fast too.
4,A must read for history buffs!,I love reading about Medieval stuff and about the Renaissance. This book was a great help in shedding more light.
3,From a rock and mineral collector,"The pictures are nice and this is a fairly good book for beginners. However, as a mineral collector I must correct some incorrect information concerning Moqui Marbles aka Shaman Stones and other various names. The author claims that if these stones don't get enough attention, they ""will turn to dust or disappear entirely"". This is simply not true.I have had these stones in my collection for years without paying any more attention to them than I would any other rock or mineral in the collection. I have a very large Moqui Marble that has sat for years on the shelf along side many other minerals without much handling at all and the stone is still in fine shape.Most of the information in the book is okay but if you really want to know how to take care of any rock or mineral, I'd suggest you look into books that a rock and mineral collector would use. Not some metaphysical type book."
5,Awesome!,"Excellent....have also ordered several for friends who absolutely love it!! I have looked high and low for a book like this, but this book is way more than I ever expected to find."
4,Healing Crystals and Gemstones,Very informative and lovely pictures of the stones and a good description on how to care for you stones and clients.Healing Crystals and Gemstones: From Amethyst to Zircon
5,very happy,"this book is simple. you are not overwhelmed with information but the info it gives is interesting to all different types of people because it shows star sign, magical properties, healing properties, history and some basic facts.so if your in to healing or the facts its both there. im really happy with it. i bought one for a friend and show my book to lots of people who also seem to think its a pretty good book."
3,great book but pages fell out,This is a great book as far as the contents but after looking thru the book a couple of times several pages were falling out.
1,The Phantom Gemstone Book,"I'd review this book but the Seller did not ship it to me and kept my money instead.Amazon has given me a credit toward my next purchase. Thanks, Amazon!"
3,Interesting Mix of Film...,"But they're not all WWII. Some Civil War Era, Some set in Mexico during a revolution. But there are some hidden gems in there if you dig through them!"
3,Films,"It was a mixture of films, Some were good films and some were bad, you get what you pay for it."
2,war film,it the biggest waste of money only a couple movies the rest i don't know what they were called at time time
3,After you've seen them all...,"For a couple of bucks it was worth it.They are mostly B- and C grade movies except for about 5 of them: Corregidor, Go For Broke, Gung Ho, One of our aircraft is Missing, and Spitfire which I would rate as solid B movies.None are in the category of Band of Brothers and the like.But, if you're like me and have seen them all (I saw Crusade in Europe on TV when I was 10...that's 50 years ago and have been watching war movies since), you can't go wrong for the price. They do include some Civil War stuff to round out the 50."
3,Bad Trend,"I am the owner of 6 other Mill Creek Ent. products and am used to the mediocre quality of both film entertainment value and visual conditions. I have been satisfied and find all of them a great value. Unfortunately, this one, Combat Classics, one which I would have been interested in, contains at least or about half of the movies on 2 other related box titles. I have Action and War and was ok with overlap of one or 2 or a couple of duds foreign or silent. This is over the top. On the big collections of 150 or more I would expect some compilation. I would have preferred 25 for $10.99 rather than the 50 for $17 plus"
1,Disappointing Collection,"I own and have enjoyed a number of these Classic 50 Movie Packs, however, this collection is not one of them. While there are a few, (very few), good films in this collection, far too many of the titles simply are not worth your time. In addition, many of the titles are included in other Mill Creek collections.Bad scripts, terrible acting, and in too many instances, very poor print quality as well. This is the first 50 Pack I've regretted buying. I'm sure there are better collections out there. Pass this one up, keep shopping."
3,Combat Classics 50 MoviePack,"We were pleased for the most part.The first 2 DVD Discs dont work or play, so we couldnt watch the first 8 movies.However all the others work fine."
3,Unable to View,Have not been able to view these classics because I can not play them on my computer or DVD player. Wish I could.
2,Disappointing Collections,"Some of the films have poor audio quality. At least one film listed on the box cover is not on any of the DVDs. The cover art suggests 20th Century wars, but some films selected dealt with the Civil War and others. Other selections were very unknown films. I would not buy this type of collection again."
1,Combat Classics Lame collection,"50 movies of which I knew about 4 of them. I was not very pleased with the collection and felt totally jipped. The movies are classics only because they are old, they surely are not the most popular. Buyer beware."
5,perfect fit,good product perfect fit 20 thousand miles so far so good highly recomend this as a replacement as this is a NEW not rebuilt pump
1,Louisiana Residents,BEWARE this software is useless in the state of Louisiana! No way of knowing that till you try to use it!
1,"No Mac Version, thus Useless","The old Willmaker came in a Mac version. I wish Nolo had kept that practice, because this Windows-only product is useless to me."
2,Worked for several months before issues,"I purchased the unit last winter, and was quite pleased for a couple of months. It was quiet, didn't create the white dust and brought the humidity to a level I was comfortable with. Near the end of February the blue light began to blink indicating it was time to replace the maintenance box. Since it was so near to the end of the season I did without, and only sought to replace the box at the beginning of this winter. So I purchased the new box from a local hardware store, easily replaced it and cranked the unit back up. The unit still doesn't function and the light continues to blink.I emailed venta and got no reply, a call to them and they recommended I check the contacts between the box and the unit. Now I find many reviews on their products with issues and very little in the way of customer service. Hopefully I can find a way to trick the unit back into working, but right now I am not happy with my hundred and fifty dollar humidifier."
1,Venta VS 350 Digital Humidifier,They were very easy to clean but they were unreliable. They would just stop working after use for a few months. I bought the units years ago. Maybe Venta improved the product.
1,No Support When You Need It,"I have had to call this company half a dozen times for my VS 207 and they never answer and never call me back. This is a different product, but the support issue still applies. You should keep that in mind if and when you invest in any of their products."
1,junk,"I don't believe I paid $159 for this! It worked for about two weeks, leaving white residue all over.Replaced it with $34 Crane adding $10 filter - runs great for 2 month with no residue.If Venta was a US company it'd be out of business long time ago..."
2,HC-940 Remington hair clipper,"This clipper kit worked great the first six month's we owned it, then it just died! I'm sending it in for repair under warranty (Has a 2 year warranty) , I don't know why I'm doing this since it will cost about $6.00 for postage. Hope I get it back before my next hair cut is needed."
1,Dog Antiques and Collectibles,"A HUGE disappoitment. I have been waiting for a book on dog collectibles, especially figurines, for years and thought this was it. Only 3 pages on figurines with a total of 22 mentioned. Most of the other types of pieces described are originals, which are obviously already in a collection, or paper. My experience is that most people collect figurines and there is a sad lack of info on them. I found this book nearly useless."
4,Oilskin Duster,"Nice coat, very comfortable. The lining is a bright plaid so as long as you don't mind that the coat is perfect!"
3,average,"It seems the main strength here are the riffs. There's basically nothing else special on this disc. The other instruments don't really compliment the guitars but ""bum off"" them for musicality. The first track is just a repeating single riff intro that is unnecessary, and the cover song is still gay, even with the raw vocals."
5,great cleaver for the money,great weight; ok balance; well-made; good quality metal; for the price - a great bargain.
1,junk,"I just wanted a nice cheap gamepad to play emulator games with. I don't need the rumbling, the analog controls; just something simple. This device is terrible. The two buttons on the top are just rapid fire buttons for two of the colored ones. The directional pad is completly out of wack; it takes all kinds of Zen meditation to guide a character in a straight line. Save your money. Do not buy this. I was like you once."
4,Destryer PC Game Pad,"Works good, price was right. Had no problems with this baby!What more can I say?"
5,Awesome debut album!,"I must say this is one of the bands that makes you happy to listen to. This album sounds alot like a happier version of helloween with great anthems which have a great combination to their metal. Chris bay is one of the best singers in power metal today and the main thing is I wanted to hear about this album was none other than former guitarist sascha gerstner's (now with helloween) neo classic guitar playing style with freedom call and I must say I like him more than ever now, And daniel dimmerman (now with gamma ray too) is one of the greatist talented drummers as always.\m/ stay metal \m/"
4,Speed Metal?,"Lets get one thing straight, Slayer is speed metal. These guys are energetic, progressive, rock. I saw this in a bargain bin with a CD from Angra. I have never heard any of these bands before and already I wanna go back and grab some more. Unlike speed metal bands, this band has a singer that can carry a tune. Also you don't feel like putting a gun to your head after listening to it.Nuff Said."
5,Barnstorming in the Concert Hall!,These performances are amazing! The soundstage simply disappears out both sidedoors of the auditorium. If you don't like singing the Dance of the Seven Veils is so good it justifies the cost. One of the great performances of all time!
4,Sound problem,"I agree with an earlier reviewer about the SACD sound being a problem on convetional CD players. I've had problems with other RCA/BMG SACD releases as well. If you have a conventional CD player, you may want to play it safe and get the regular version (assuming it's still around). But do try and find it, as these are among the best Strauss vocal recordings ever made. For many of us, Reiner and Borkh ""owned"" this music, and my only regret is that they didn't get a chance to record the complete operas commercially. A true classic."
2,"Blows fuses, problems internally",I have had my unit for 3 years and it worked great until now. It has been blowing fuses recently and now it just blew something inside. I opened it up and can see the damage. I would look at other options.
1,Short lived units,I purchased 2 of these unit to power 6 chairs equipped with factory installedbutkickers. A little over one year later both of these amps are dead.
4,One woman's moving account of life in the Foreign Service.,"Well written, this is the moving autobiography of a an attache wife's journey through three decades of travel and living overseas. Told with wit and irony, the reader rides the waves of happiness and sadness of the author's life in a manner that is deeply personal, often uplifting, sometimes heart wrenching. One marvels at the diversity of her experiences in locations ranging from the jungle regions of Central America to Buckingham Palace. Of equal interest are her descriptions of the people who cross her path, whether they be from the farthest reaches of the earth to the height of celebrity (Helen Hayes and John Wayne as examples). It is a pleasure to recommend this book as a fascinating insight into the life of an American woman who, as a team with her husband, represented our country with integrity, commitment, and dazzle."
5,Estupendo!,"From This Day Forward should be required reading for anyone contemplating a career in foreign service, and read twice by anyone contemplating marriage to someone so inclined. Helen Rodman's memoirs capture the diplomatic life perfectly -- the adventure of new places delivered by frequent packing and the necessary letting go of things dear. Beneath it all is a love story -- a tale of enduring passion and shared dreams, of monumental loss, and the triumph of lives well lived. Bravo, Mrs. Rodman!"
1,Lies... the author advised torture tactics against Haitians.,"This book is part of the continuous disinformation campaign being waged on Haiti and the popularly elected president Aristide. The author of the book was a personal advisor of the murderous thug Cédras, shouldn't that tell you something. Raoul Cédras's horrific regime toppled a lawfully elected president and killed more than 5 thousands people and this guy has the nerve to write a book praising the State Department and CIA dirty deeds!? Don't buy this book. It is nothing but sick propaganda against an innocent Haitian people being preyed upon. For a more accurate account of events depicting the courage of haitians both abroad and local to re-patriate their president, read: Haiti : Dangerous Crossroads by Deidre McFadyen etc."
1,Absolute Lies!,"The entire book is a fiction. Lynn Garrison was employed by the brutal dictators and military regime. He was responsible for obtaining a forgery of a ""medical report"" on Aristide declaring him to be mentally unstable. He was on the military payroll to get Aristide out of power. He later admitted to being paid to get the forgery. If you want a true account of what has been going on in Haiti over the years, read ""The Uses of Haiti"" by Paul Farmer, a man who has lived and worked in Haiti for well over 20 years. Don't believe this self-agrandizing propaganda!"
5,my brother,"After growing up with the exploits of Lynn and his major involvement with the people of Haiti, I can say that this book should hit to home to people that care about their felow human beings that don't necessarily have the tools to make things better."
5,In-depth Look at Haitian Politics,"This book is really good. Everything written is completely true, and i like it very much. It was an excellent read."
5,The CD Spacesaver,"Nice spring-loaded drawers ...when you press the button, the drawer slides out and the front tilts towards you for easier viewing!"
1,rather to go die than listening to this!,"what a garbage this band is! the answer of the german teeny girl band for SPICE GIRLS in the UK. The girls are pretty but they do not show us any capability how they could play any of instruments on stage, and neither they could read any of the musical notes.the germans keep on saying ""SCHROTT"""
1,IT BITES!,"I was so dissapointed in this video! It is so diguesting! The camrea was too close to the faces, it was boring and it was just so stupid! Pllus, it's unauthorized! I wouldn't waste my time on it!"
4,"Fun book, great nightstand reading","I have this book on my nightstand right now, that way I can look at a few of the diagrams or read a short chapter before bed.I particularly enjoyed Andrew Bomback's short story ""Henry Kannenberg's Little Slice Of America"". This was a really entertaining read. Reading it made me cringe (but in a good way!) - the story was painful, awkward, pathetic, and funny. Plus, the author managed to add a few twists which were delightful.I enjoy the varied content of this little book very much; the book includes poems, short stories, and black and white illustrations arranged alphabetically by author. I'm now interested in seeing the original magazine because I wonder how the content flowed together originally - was it alphabetical in the magazine too, or was there some sense of design or order to the way the selections were arranged?"
4,Easy and helpful,"Upon the recmmendation of one of my professors, I ordered the Berlitz French CD Pack to prepare for my upcoming trip to Paris. It is very helpful to not only read the words and pronunciations, but also hear them spoken correctly. The most used words and phrases are the focus of the CD but some of the phrases are spoken too quickly to really get a handle on the exact pronunciation. However, listening to the CD during my commute has atuned my ear to the language, and the repetition has helped me to acquire some basic phrases with very little effort."
2,Is that all there is?,"The begining of the CD was good, but the rest of the program did not impress me with the phrases they chose to teach. It left me looking for yet another French CD to learn from for just more of the basics."
2,won't buy another one,"This was a gift for a five year old,I know they say eight it was better received from the six year old,she flew it very well when the wind was going. Also the nose wasn't too good as it soon peeled away,needs a little muscle to put it together not very clear instructions. Price was good for the item but not the charge on delivery. Arrived in no rush, as stated. Would buy a kite next time."
4,Interesting,"This book was a little harder to read and was a conglomeration of pilot's stories of one of more iconic aircraft of the RAF during the war. I was particularly looking forward to reading stories of 486 (NZ) Squadron, but there were precious few. Nontheless, this book gave me insight into a great aircraft and the dedicated pilots that flew it.Well worth the purchase price for fans of the Typhoon.For fans I would recommend the books by Jim Sheddan (who is still alive and living in North West Auckland, New Zealand)."
1,They will send you 13' cable instead of 20',"This cable is cheap and you should not expect much quality. I did not, however this company have sent me wrong cable. Their internal order record shows I have ordered 13' instead of 20' cable. Also, they will expect you to ship this cable back at your own expense. Also you should expect them to hang up on you and never call back."
3,RCA Sub cable,This item is not as pictured. The image gives the impression that this is a high end cable with metallic ends. It is actually the cheaper moulded type of connector.Still a decent cable for the price.
4,Mono Sub cable,"Good product at a good price, however it is not as pictured, Item pictured is the 600 or 700 series, these have the cheaper molded plastic shields on each end. Sound was great and apart from not looking really $$$, this is a good cable."
2,Vague at best,"I found this book to be less than informative, and very vague when it came to waterfalls. With regard to a pond it was very good, but fell very short of how to design, install, and maitain a waterfall. In fact the waterfall information was on about 4 pages total. Not worth the purchase."
4,Garden Pools,"Good Information material to start a project. Great pictures, easy reading. Complete description. I will Recomend this product to my friends."
5,Great single source book for apartment/loft living,"The book contains alot of doable ideas for making a small apartment or studio into ""real"" living. It gives a simple breakdown of the basic elements to utilizing whatever size space you have. There are also other books in the ""Making the Most of..."" series. They all seem well thought out."
3,Could definitely be better!,"Although there are a few pictures of homes I like, overall I would say there is too much going on in the small spaces featured in this book. The lighting, color and organization schemes of the rooms could use some constructive criticism. Not a total loss but there are definitely better DIY interior decorating books out there."
3,A good start,"While definitely not my favorite, this book has taken it's place among my collection succesfully. The cover, although extremely ugly, should not sway you. This is a nice book for amateurs, in fact it was one of my first."
5,Thoughtless and Cruel,I am hooked on this CD. I love Springsteen and Seger and the lead singers voice is very similar. The songs just stick in your head...
1,somewhat archaic read,"Low rated because it takes a lot of effort to read because the story line is somewhat 'Forsythe saga' like, it may be dated to the 30's-50's era British novel genre, uses a scientific angle based on FTL travel using either harmonics or vibration theories preceding much of present science, and it is definitely a sequel (thus some explanations of the storyline may be lost in it's prequel). Some of the planetary discovery sequences of the Moon, Mars and Falon are stellar, maybe not possible but definitely enthralling. Part of the story is about life and this part mostly lost my interest, maybe for the reasons above. There is a 'vegetarian life style' and interludes damning the concept of money in society. Suggest it be read slowly and with others and diced for content, but with it's prequel, which I believe is ""A Planet Named Terra"". The spaceship's name is Photon Flight. Thanks, Harry."
3,Warranty,"My drive died after 7 months. However, unlike the other person who reviewed this device, Linksys was responsive. They sent me a cross-ship RMA within two days. I filled out the form and FAXed it back. They then send a new drive, and I return the old one in the carton. I only pay for the ship back costs.The warranty is for two years and they accept RMAs for the entire warranty period. As with all drives, sometimes they fail and you should make a backup occasionally. Failure to do so is not a Linksys issue."
3,convenient headset,"switches from a phone headset to a PC headset with the click of a switch. There seems to be a short where I loose audio sometimes, but flicking the mute button restores audio. Wierd, but not too big a deal. Its easier than having 2 headsets."
1,Same old arguments,"This book spouts the same old arguments that have been used by ""orthodox"" scholars for decades. Unfortunately, there is nothing new - no new insights, no new evidence, nothing. By labeling authorship doubters ""heretics"", the author betrays his belief that Shaksper of Stratford is a God and one MUST believe in him by faith. What a shame. No need to buy this book - it's just the same regurgitated information you can find in any encyclopedia."
1,History as Argument Without End,"I BELIEVE ""BARDOLATORS"" SHOULD NOT CLOSE THEIR MINDS TO THE CONTINUING AUTHORSHIP QUESTION. THERE SEEMS TO BE AT LEAST ONE BOOK EACH YEAR WITH SERIOUS SCHOLARSHIP QUESTIONNING THE MAN FROM STRATFORD AS THE TRUE AUTHOR. FOR EXAMPLE, SEE ""SHAKESPEARE BY ANOTHER NAME"", BY MARK ANDERSON (2005); SHAKESPEARE'S UNORTHODOX BIOGRAPHY"" BY DIANA PRICE (2001); AND ""PLAYERS"" BY BERTRAM FIELDS (2005) TO NAME SOME. THE LEADING CANDIDATE FOR NEARLY 100 YEARS HAS BEEN THE 17TH EARL OF OXFORD. MARK ANDERSON'S BIO OF THE EARL AS THE TRUE AUTHOR IS NIGH IRREFUTABLE. SEE ALSO MARK TWAIN'S ESSAY ""IS SHAKESPEARE DEAD?"" TWAIN, NO FOOL, WAS AN EARLY DOUBTER. I FIND TOO MANY OF THE ORTHODOX BIOS TO BE MORE ABOUT ELIZABETHAN SOCIETY THAN ABOUT VALIDATING THE TRUE AUTHOR. SEE E.G. STEPHEN GREENBLATT'S BIO."
2,"Clever, not substantive","McCrea does a better job than Irvin Matus (Shakespeare In Fact), but, in the final analysis, McCrea lacks depth, depends upon well-worn foundational assumptions that he uncritically accepts, and introduces a good deal of his own conjecture to solve long-standing problems with the Stratfordian Tradition."
1,There is better.,"Purchased this printer. I was very disapointed. It left black streaks when printing. Also the printing was poor, and it will only print on super smooth surfaces. I ordered the CW-100 Thermo printer, to replace this one. It works much better."
1,Vista Users Beware!!,"I purchased this product directly from the Casio website. I read the fine print (I thought) which stated that the item IS compatible with Windows Vista. After unpacking, setting up and beginning to install, my computer was unable to locate the device driver for the printer. I returned to the Casio website, found the ""New"" driver for Windows Vista, downloaded and installed it. The device was still not functioning and Windows could not locate the driver. I again returned to the Casio website. Oh, guess what??!! Lo and behold, down at the bottom of the driver page in fine print it states that this printer is NOT compatible with Windows Vista x64, which just so happens to be MY version. Lucky me!!So, as a warning to anyone out there with Windows Vista x64...this printer WILL NOT WORK!!! Do not waste your money.Now, I get to call Casio's customer service line and begin the process of obtaining authorization to return my new paperweight at my own expense.Have a nice day!!! I am!!!"
4,Good simple product,"This labeler works as advertised. It does stop in the middle of printing sometimes for no apparent reason, but unplugging and replugging it in solves the problem. Even though the ink tapes are very small, they seem to last longer than expected. I am pleased I bought it since the printed titles are much better than my handwriting."
1,So sorry I ignored past posts!,"It broke after 6 prints. Six. You cant talk to anyone. You have to PAY to ship it. Then theyll let you know if they will charge you. Don't do business with Casio. I thought surely they must have fixed thier product, but no, they didnt."
5,British Superbike review,"This is a really cool dvd, lots of action, great on bike camera shots. I would recommend this to any road racing fan."
5,PERFECT!,"This is THE gamepad to get. I love it. The interface was easy to use, the buttons are laid out perfectly and the D-Pad is GREAT! Only one flaw, the D-Pad is hard to double tap for fighting games, or any other game, it's hard to go in a perfect line too. But other than that is the best gamepad I have ever used, I even tossed my old Sidewinder."
3,"feels good on hand, but d-pad needs improvement","This is my third gamepad from Gravis. They really make nice gamepads, if only they make them durable enough! I like the way Gravis weigh down the wings... makes holding on to it feel good. The button design and layout has always been well thought of, but problems always starts with the direction pads. After a few months, they start having calibration problems. It progressively gets worse, and after a year, you feel like throwing it away and getting a new one.Good thing is they are relatively cheap. But I really wish they could improve the direction pads so I don't need to keep buy a new one annually!"
1,Durablity Stinks,"Maybe it's just me, but in about 1 or 2 months, the paint started coming off the joystick/pad with only the face of my thmb (no scratching). Also, about a week later, It just stopped. It died, no longer worked. I took it apart and nothing was loose. I think the circuts got messed up. Basically, if you are planning to do anything other than look at this gamepad, which isn't too pretty anway, don't purchase this (unless somebody pays you to do it)"
1,Absolutely Horrible,"The D-Pad is horrible on this thing. I don't know if I got a defective product, but I can't get the controller to calibrate to a neutral position. Your best bet if you want a quality controller is to get one of those USB Playstation controller adapters and use a Playstation controller to play your games. In my opinion, the PS controller is the best controller ever made."
4,"Good, good.","Well, in my opinion, this is a good gamepad. The problem is for me is that it doesn't have a 15 pin connector, just for USB. I couldn't use it because my 98 is unstable. So that means it is only for 98 and up (they said so, if people say 95, don't believe them). Well, the D pad is like a joystick, moveable in all directions. The buttons and shoulder buttons are labeled in numbers, from 1 to 10. It does look like a PS1 controller, without analog joysticks or whatever you call them. There is a CD for you to configure the buttons, even you can probably try doing specials in games. For my controller (I returned it, no other had a 15 pin connector), I had a bit of trouble with L1 (think of a PS1), I had to push it a bit more harder than the others, probably won't happen for you. This gamepad will do well in SNES emulators (I hope). Just mess around with the thing until you get it right. It is just a bit hard reaching for the shoulder buttons."
2,Dpad gets stuck,"I bought this because I liked the feel and flexibility of the dpad, but I took the first one back because the dpad got stuck. Now my second unit has the same problem, after several months of use."
3,Not a great book,"Its not a very great book, apart from a few case studies there is no concrete model around which the book has been written such as Michael Cusumano's Platform leadership( a somewhat related are)"
3,"Eye catching title, good content, but a little dry in description",This is not a book you read while sitting in a coffee shop. A little too dry in describing a rather interesting topic. I very much look forward to the next edition to this book which i believe came out earlier in 07.I think this is a great text book for MBA or a CS/EE course on Technology and Strategy. One almost needs to be forced to complete reading the entire book.
5,Nice look,This clock is a colorful conversation starter. Takes a little getting used to in telling time but a very interesting clock.
3,Tihuanaco theses of older moon,"Many very interesting ideas for explaining the technology found in the Tihuanaco ruins, in Bolivia. The ancient moon theses about an older satellite who crashed on earth, because of the gravity pull, is indeed interesting. I'm open to anything that could explain the ""memory gap"" humanity seems to have about its distant past. Puts a lot of emphasis on the calendar gate, old news today since the book is a little bit out dates. Worth readimg to explore new and old avenues to our origines."
3,It's very thin,"It wouldn't stand up to outdoor use, but for decorating a basement wall, it's just right. It's a real bargain."
4,hawaii state flag,"The flags are light weight nylon, but colorful. A great bargain at the price. USPS took 3 weeks to deliver them, but I'm still pleased with this transaction."
4,More fragile than it looks; best used as display.,"I bought this and another sword for a film I was shooting. It wasn't used for sword play, but the character who wore it had to take it out of his belt and place it on a table about 30 times (during rehearsal and for multiple takes), and it was transported with the tripods and C-stands instead of with the more delicate furnishings and props. The leather covering on the grip came loose by the end of the first day and had to be glued back to the handle, and the handle is now very loosely attached to the blade, which is why I cannot give the item 5 stars. It is, however, a handsome and wholly believable weapon to look at, and it is being sold on Amazon at a bargain price. I know, because I checked all the usual medieval-faire-vendors' sites first. I got the use I wanted from it, and will be happy henceforth to hang it on my wall."
5,"Agree with others, this one is enduring, underrated, before its time","In my youth never could find a band with a Christian perspective whose music I didn't find mostly just tired reproductions of whatever was currently popular.Black Eyed Sceva was the exception with lyrics I still remember, songs I still like, and wow, why didn't more people love these guys?I am hearing them referred to as emo-pop, but emo wasn't around when this product was offered up. Still I don't have a better label for them. They are easy to enjoy, and there is a sense of tumult in their lyrics and sound. I still like the faith based perspective, it keeps me listening."
5,Still my favorite version...,"For digital art, where images are entirely created in a paint program, Photoshop 5.5 is the absolutely the most efficient and easy-to-use version of Photoshop. The bugaboo of the later versions is the fusion of the Paintbrush and Airbrush tools. It seems like a small change, but those are the tools used the most in digital art and it saves an unbelievable amount of time when you don't have to flip through menus every time you want to change between them. And Imageready 2.0 is a wonderful program if you have to upload your images online for portfolios or archives."
1,Not entirely pleased,I bought photoshop 5.5 for PC and thought that was what I purchased but then received photoshop for MAC. The next issue was the seller's return policy. He has a re-stocking fee which made returning the software not worth the postal fee nor the refund I would have received. Plus his re-stocking fee is such that he still makes money for this kind of retail sale from Amazon. It does seem likely he is in the business of re-stocking items to make money.
2,Surprisingly dull!,"Not up to the other Boulez/Stravinsky releases. Pedestrian performances of the SYMPHONY OF PSALMS (Chailly much better for this). For the Symphony in Three Movements stick with Colin Davis/Bayrische Rundfund. Also, what's up with DGG's recorded sound on this release? Muddy, lacking in detail."
3,OK Setup at a nice price,"Bought one of these units several months ago, and the only problem I found is the low quality earpiece and microphone. I would recommend ditching them as soon as you get the unit and going with a higher quality set to plug into the base. Other than that, the price is certainly right.Setup comes with batteries, base, and headset, but it does accept standard size 3.5mm stereo earphone and microphone jacks. There is also a 9V AC adapter jack on the back if you want to add a universal AC adapter for constant power."
4,Head set,I bought this headset because I interview people over the phone and don't want to sit there with my head bent sideways all day. I have an ancient phone at work so I can't buy some $4 headset from walmart and jack it in. I found this on Amazon (sets in stores cost $100 and up) paid for it and got it a couple days later. It hooked up easily. You barely need the directions. It works great. Just don't turn the volume all the way up. I did that on accident and made myself deaf due to the feedback screaming in my ear.The best part about this headset is that I could replace it with any set out there made for a computer.
1,Absolutely disgraceful!,"This book was a waste of time! There was no in depth analysis of anything, and the book was full of unexplained examples.This book wasnt written with any consideration, and the advertising discussed was basically researched and pasted in.I advise to stay away from this book!"
3,You must see him live to understand,"Why is Bill Wharton the ""Sauce Boss""?Because, he dresses in a full chef's outfit (with the hat), gets on stage with his guitars, amps, washboard,pots, pans, okra, shrimp, chicken and hot sauce, cooks gumbo while he performs and then feeds the audience upon the conclusion of the musical performance. When he's not performing, he takes his culinary talents to food shelters to feed the homeless.When he performs, there is comedy and silliness injected (how could you play and cook at the same time without having fun?) and the audience is part of the show dancing, yelling and whistling with him.He plays a lite, George Thorougood-type of roadhouse blues with a generous mixture of Zydeco, rock and country.This cd is a perfect sample of what he is all about. If you have a familiarity with him, then it's a lot of fun. If not, do not confuse this with mainstream blues...because of the lyrical content, it has more of a novelty vibe."
1,compilation,This is a compilation CD and not the first album. I give it one star due to its misleading nature.
2,Good and Bad,"I was more interested in ""The Messiah"" for the religious content than as a music critic, but this was too much. The strings are tinny. The orchestra is plodding. The soloists and choir are thankfully very good and seem to understand the meaning of the words. It is a shame the sound mix is uneven. The male parts come across loud and clear, but the poor women. For instance, No. 9 Oh thou that tellest..., the soloist sounded like she was singing in an echo chamber far from the mike. This is one of the most disappointing versions of ""The Messiah"" I have heard in a long time."
2,Disappointing,I bought Bead Fantasies and Bead Fantasies II at the same time after reading the positive reviews; I wish I had looked at them before buying. There are pretty motifs that I will incorporate into my beading projects but I find the small typed directions overly simplistic and the diagrams are too small. I'm glad this isn't my first beading book or I would feel totally discouraged from trying any of these projects. I won't be buying Bead Fantasies III. The Art and Elegance of Beadweaving and Coraling Technique remain my favorite beading books.
2,Bead Happy,"I bought this book, and was so disappointed with the almost non existing instructions. I would not encourage anyone who is a beginner to use this book."
2,Split quickly,"I received the 24x18 21/4 inch board as a Christmas gift. I oiled it regularly with the Boos oil and dried it after use. Despite all of my effort, it split in multiple places in less than 2 months. Another reviewer had the same problem. I agree that the quality of the manufacturer must have declined over the years since there are so many great reviews. I was really disappointed. I wouldn't reorder since I think the product is poor. It looked great when it arrived but sadly, it didn't perform nearly as well. Thankfully Amazon accepted it back and told me they would credit my brother's account including the shipping (the board is very heavy). I am not sure that they have done so yet."
1,Warped! 2X,I tried this product twice. Each time the product was unlevel (warped). What a disappointment.
2,Not really worth it,Honestly it is seriously not worth the money. I use it occasionally and this board starts to split within 2 weeks. I tried my best to keep moisture away from this board and it does not really help. Sadly the quality feels really cheap as well.
4,size and weight were much greater,"Although the quality is excellent, the size and weight were much greater than what the picture indicated. I bought it as a gift and the receivers weren't sure they had a counter large enough to accommodate it."
4,"Larger (24x18) size is very heavy, but well built.","I ordered the 24x18 size, I could have done better with a smaller one. The size I got it a little too big (and heavy), but I like it :). The bigger the board the heavier it is, the board can be pretty heavy for you to move it from the counter top to sink in case you want to wash it. I am pretty sure my wife wont be able to lift it. The board is well constructed and has a nice finish. I also bought the oil, its a good idea to use the oil once a while on the board to keep the surface knife friendly. I am happy with the purchase, but I really really wish I had listened to my wife and bought a smaller size."
3,Very Large & Very Heavy,"It's an attractive cutting board. But I'd have to second many comments about the size. While I wanted something large so I could chop several different vegetables, I learned that it would be much to heavy for me to lift it with ease. In addition to this, it would not fit into the sink for those of us with double-sinks, something that didn't occur to me before it came home with me. Unfortunately, a 13"" for the smallest dimension was all that would fit into my dishpan. And to remove the dishpan, I was still limited to under 15 inches."
4,Did not receive oil & cream from manufacturer.,"I love the size, 24 x 18, looks great, but, am disappointed it stated in the description the manufacturer was supposed to send the oil & cream for maintenance, & I did not receive any, had to purchase it separately.."
3,unfinished?,Not super pleased. The surface on this is rougher than anything I've encountered on wood chopping boards. It drinks up the Boos block oil and still looks dry & absorbs stains like crazy. I expected better from an old company with an American made product. If I wanted to sand and refinish why would I buy new?
1,John Boos 24 X 18 X -1/2 Reversible Cutting Board,"The board split within six weeks after receipt. Boos did not bother to reply to two separate contacts. This is supposedly a ""professional/top quality"" cutting board. I bought it assuming my husband could use it for years. Six weeks for $86?!"
1,"Don't buy. It warps, molds, and isn't worth the $$",I have this butcher bock. I cook about 5x a week and I use it to cut everything but meat. We are clean and live in a no-humidity area (Denver) and it still has warped beyond usability and regularly molds on the underside. Have tried treating it routinely with mineral oil to no avail. It will go in the trash.
4,"Solid board, not well surfaced","I've got a couple of the smaller Boo's boards and have been pretty happy with them over the years, so when I needed something larger I didn't hesitate to plunk down the dough for this enormous thing. It too is a nice solid hunk of wood, but I was pretty disappointed by all the visually noticeable peaks and valleys in the surface, and mine had some kind of weird flaw in the wood that probably shouldn't have made it past QC.Luckily I'm reasonably handy with a belt sander and was able to rectify these problems (you're going to have to resurface any board you buy at some point), but it was still not a good out-of-box experience. You probably couldn't make your own any cheaper, but if you have the means to do so, you might want to try it anyway. At least then you'll know who to blame."
5,Perfect,"This board is the perfect size to cut all your vegetables and still be able to leave them all on the board without getting in the way. Its a nice wood for quality knives, so it doesn't damage them. Make sure to treat the board with mineral oil prior to cutting chicken or fish on it. All in all, its a great board that I look forward to using every day."
5,Simply Great,"The title of my review says it all. This review process requires to write at least 20 words., so I am just filling the required space."
2,warps.....,"extremely handsome. but...it warps, folks. big time - about 1/2"" across the least dimension. i do not recommend this at all!"
5,Boos cuttng board..large heavy duty,"This large heavy duty Boos cutting board is gorgeous and a great bargain...I had been planning to get one since I saw a friend's last summer, and now that I have done so. I wish i had not waited so long...I love it! But that's just me! I love great kitchen stuff!"
5,Gets the job done and then some....,"I had been wanting a cutting board that would enable me to chop up several things and keep them all on the board until it's time to cook them. This board is about the largest I could find and it does just as I had hoped. The only issue I have with the board is that it slides around a bit on my quartz countertop. I seem to manage fine with that issue, however, by using a small silicone rubber mat (traditionally used for opening a jar) underneath. I love this board and I can see it is never going to be needing to be replaced in my lifetime."
5,Great everything board,"This board does NOT disappoint, it's everything it says and more. If you are looking to purchase a high quality cutting board this is the one. The indented hand gripes on the sides of the board makes it easy to handle and the thickness of the board is perfect. I considered purchasing the 2 1/2 inches thick board but it would have been a mistake; the extra thickness is not necessary and would have looked oversized on my countertop. If you purchase a Boos cutting board plan on buying the Boos mystery oil and/or board cream to go with it. The board felt dry and Boos recommends an application of the cream/oil before 1st use. The cream/oil needs to be applied weekly if the board is used as often as I use mine. It's a small investment to preserve the quality of the cutting board."
4,Great carving board,A great cutting board as long as you are willing to put in the effort to oil it a lot in the beginning and regularly after that. A must for protecting your valuable knives.
5,Just what we wanted.,"We had been looking at Boos Board cutting boards for almost two years, when i found the great deal on Amazon we had to get it. It's very heavy duty and great quality. its large enough we can easily use multiple spots on the board and clean after."
2,Knock Knock,I want to love this board but after 10 days I'm having to return it - it warped just that fast! Chopping on it makes it rock back and forth and the dogs think someone is knocking at the door. Not sure what to try now...
5,Beautiful,"I couldn't be more pleased with this cutting board. It is huge and heavy and hard and absolutely, perfectly flat. The thing glows with that unmatchable hardwood depth. If you know what I mean, then you will not be disappointed with this product."
4,Great value,"Great, sturdy cutting board. Almost too nice to use! Very pleased. The only negative was that it came with a dent on the side. Probably from being dropped during shipping."
2,"It's Good, but not as advertised.","You could do alot better in finding ""New Car Scent"". Not only does this airfreshner not smell like New Car Scent, its like the developers didn't even try! It smells NOTHING close to new car scent! Its like they made a random fragrance, then couldn't come up with a name so they dubbed it ""New Car Scent"".On the other hand, it can be stuck in a glove compartment totally hidden and provide strong, long lasting fragrance. The smell isn't bad either, just NOT New Car Scent. It doesn't even smell like a cheap immitaion. For a cheap immatation of New Car Scent, look at little trees ""Black Ice"". Also, for a real smelling new car scent, check out this one flavored ""New Car Scent Platinum"". I don't remember the company, but it was a vent clip, and it works alot better (and smells like new car scent)."
1,Terrible Scent,"I've liked other scents from this company, but this one is terrible. It smells more like smoker's clothing. Nothing like a new car scent. This is going directly in the garbage."
3,"It smells like ""Bad Deodorant""!","It dosne't smell like a new car, but it does smeel like some bad deodorant.The Pine Scent is so much better.This is for guys that dont't shower often and need some deodorant in there car."
2,Has new age music,"Not my thing. I really wanted just the Redwood Forest sounds, but there's sappy new age music on top of it."
3,Intimacy with the Devil,"Although this book wasn't necessarily riveting, envisioning the devil at the heart of fiction writing is most intriguing. Baxter and Turchi combine essays and anecdotes dealing with issues on, technique, devices, and strategies. These anecdotes allow the reader to engage in a sort of dialogue with other published writers who may experience similar problems with creating fiction.In this book the Devil is interpreted as inhibition; what ever is keeping the writer from writing. But it is the intimacy with this Devil (bringing Him to His knees) that is necessary in order to progress as a fiction writer. This Devil teaches the writer more about him/herself than anything else, as long as he is acknowldged and entertained."
4,A Great Place to Start,"Because I consider myself a WWI novice, this book was a great place to start. It enabled me to verify and validate information found in other sources. I author a number of miniature gaming books for Britton Publishers and this provided much needed detail of trench warfare. I enjoy the Osprey series and find most of them quite helpful."
1,Paid for but never received...,"I placed an order, paid for item, yet never received it. Amazon's system has no provision to file a non-receipt of item claim."
4,Good pair of pants,"I bought the black pair from Sears, then bought these Bark ones from amazon. The color was more like a light bark green. The color can potentially stain easily, I thought it was alot darker as it looks alot darker on my computer screen. Oh well, I still like the pants, they never wrinkle, they give ALOT on the waist. Because of the snow, I wear long johns under them, and i have no problems with the pants. They fit fine, I'm a 32x30, and they fit like that compared to all the other pants I have bought over the years. In short, I'd buy another pair in another color. These can be used all year round, to me the black is the best, as I don't have to wash them for months!!! lol I'm a guy, what can I say."
5,Good looking Pant,"Bought these for my husband. He likes the fit and appreciates the quality of the material. I like the ease of care, they launder great, no need to iron."
1,"Not the product, but the company","I would love to rate this product, but have yet to receive it. I ordered two chains from this company on one order. I received only one of them in the box. The invoice inside said that BOTH chains were in the package. I waited a day to see if the other would arrive. It did not. Then I emailed the company. The next day, I received only a confirmation, of the original order, of shipment. I waited several more days for a reply or my necklace. Still nothing. So I sent another email through Amazon. I am, again, waiting for some action from this company. Nearly three weeks and no necklace, no Email...nothing. I will never deal with this company again, but they darn sure better give me either my product or a refund. Will update when I have resolution."
3,"Great, but I expected more...","I have enjoyed this product but it is not user-friendly - a lot of times when you click or double-click on links or options nothing happens. I haven't left click and select open or use the File, Open selections to view that information. Additionally, it did not include the NIV version of the Bible (you have to pay an additional $20 for that). Finally, the majority of the Daily Bible Study Plans would not open at all. This could be a fantastic program and I really enjoy having so many commentaries and versions of the Bible at my fingertips - I just wish it was designed better and more user-friendly."
3,The Newspapers did a better job.,"This was OK. However, I think that the Newspapers did a better job when it came to the objectives of Mr. Gotti as well as with his life. The press exposure he received was his undoing. Thank you for your attention."
2,Take the canoli's and leave the movie....,"A fictional tale... Armand Assante plays the same character the same way with the same accent in every movie - POORLY. Armand once again proves he's a one trick pony w/ his portrayal of the John Gotti character. Hey Armand, take acting lessons. Only a cafone would give this movie more than 2 stars"
2,All the character wants to do is eat,"Thought the character was into eating too much, really didn't get the recipes, just the history, not too much of a plot."
4,Dinner Plates,"The dinner plates came in in one piece, but since they were titled ""dinner"" plates, I wasn't expecting them to be plastic. However, my mother-in-law is a HUGE Cubs fan, so she liked them anyway :)"
2,OVERRATED GERGIEV,"Once again Gergiev proves he is a lousy Tchaikovsky interpreter.The kirov players play well as they have done in years past with Tchaikovskys music but thats the only thing going for this version,there is plenty more out there that are far better namely Eugene Ormandy (columbia 1960)philidelphia,Charles Dutiot (decca)montreal symphony,and some others.karajan,and jansons are good also."
3,Comfortable but not worth full price,"this game pad is a great pad, but its definetly not worth full price , if you can get it for [price]to [price] dollars off the price take it, the pad is really comfortable but the runble effects half the time do not work correctly, in my use of it I have not seen a game that supports rumble effects that this pad uses them correctly, I give this a 3 meaning its not a bad pad but not a great one either..."
1,2 strikes not going for a third,Did not work out of the box. One joystick was stuck permanently moving left. Returned and second one survived a few months before it quit working.
1,Zero stars actually,"Where to start. The biggest complaint I have with this gamepad is that when using the D-Pad and trying to go left, it wants to go diagonal-left. This is a known issue with this gamepad (one that Gravis doesn't seem to care about) and is a big problem if you're playing a game that requires any sort of precision (like most of them). Nothing like going in a direction you didn't want to go or walking off a cliff.The second biggest complaint I have is the software. It's the hokeyist software I've ever used. It would forget my button assignments, wouldn't save when I finished creating button assignments, and wouldn't recognize executibles consistently. In short, it didn't work. I'd be playing a game and suddenly the controller stops working. Bring up the software, no more button mappings.I threw the gamepad away and bought a Logitech Cordless Rumblepad 2 from Amazon and have had none of these problems."
1,Get something else.,"I bought this thing like 4 months ago and had nothing but problems with it, I ended up buying it, then returning it because the d-pad was inoperable, pressing up caused the directional control to go up and left, same with pressing left (and before you blame my fat fingers, I even used a straight pin to press the directional control straight up using the topmost right corner of the up direction and it still went left). the analog controls are horribly inaccurate and are nearly impossible to center unless you turn the deadband (or nullzone as they call it) all the way up to the maximum value. And lastly, the entire device recently just went kaput, and gravis doesn't know what to tell me besides ""we'll give you a new one if your warrantee hasn't expired"", too bad I discarded the box, eh? I dunno about you, but I'm not buying a new one of these every 4 months at 40 bucks a pop (even 20 bucks is too much). get a thrustmaster or something that works."
4,It is a VERY good pad!,"I cannot really understand why one of the previous reviewers had those problems. With the Gamepad comes an installation program (Version 4.3a) and after installing you have a whole bunch of options to choose from to setup your controller. Once you figured out how to set it up right (very good manual), the controller works flawlessly in all my games without any problems. Both analog and digital controls are usable. The buttons are good to reach and the handling is better than every other controller i had before. I changed from a MS Sidewinder Pro Gamepad to this one because my thumbs hurt after only a couple of minutes playing with the MS Product. This is much better. Very ergonomic! I cannot give 5 stars though, because the ""Aftershock"" feature is not impressive, but i really couldn't care less about this."
4,better than most...,"I got the Eliminator and returned it the next day...the directional pad was horrid...on the Eliminator Aftershock, however, the D Pad worked very well for platforming games and is decent for fighting games...the only real problem I have with the controller is the locationof the four buttons...they're too close to the center, and often when I'd attempt to hit the top two (buttons 3 and 4), I'd overreach and hit the precision button.I'm running OSX.2 (jaguar) and using this for emulation purposes..."
4,"A great controller, IF you have have big hands!","I'm a fully grown adult male and I have small hands. While I can reach every button, I cannot reach the four face buttons without streaching my hand until it cramps, not good at all. If these buttons where placed close to the edge, iit'd be perfect. If possible, try before you buy.As long as you download the latest software at Gravis.com, one should zero problems with it.Other then the size problem, it's an very comfortable game pad."
1,P.O.S.,Well I'm on my second one now and I've given up. The D-pad has not worked correctly on either. If you don't mind that and you like spending excessive amounts of time learning their retarded software this is the controller for you. Junk.
4,Thrilling-- up to a point,"It's the story of Alejandro, the heir of a financial empire in Mexico, who decides to escape his artificial life and ends up in a lost seaside village village in the province of Michoacan.What I liked about the movie is the beautiful landscapes it makes us discover, the grip of narcos on Mexican life that is portrayed, and the corruption of Mexican politicians that is harshly rendered.Otherwise, the ending was predictable. It's been done thousands of times already."
3,Mikasa mugs used to be better quality,"I was once enamored with Mikasa, but their quality has gone down over the past few years. I bought a complete set of the Garden Harvest mugs in the mid 1990s and have replaced a few over the years. That's what this purchase was for. However, when I got the mugs they are lighter weight than their older counterparts although they are the same size. and the pattern is not consistently place on the mug -- sometimes the edge is right at the top but it can vary by up to 1/4"" or so. All in all for our morning coffee I still love the Garden Harvest design and these mugs will do the job. Just disappointed that the quality is not what it once was."
4,fine and true,"an excellent resource for any library. I checked it out and read it and then searched until I found one to own. Sometimes tender, sometimes harsh, its realism touches the soul while providing a gritty dose of reality."
4,Insightful,"This book is a true account about the struggles, and hardships of the pioneer womans journey to the west.I didn't realize, untill i read this book, how strong the woman of that time were. We take so much for granted today with all our modern conveniences, that even pouring a glass of water back then was not an easy task.Its was also interesting to learn that, alot of todays modern conveniences were thought up by these woman and improved on over time, they say neeccesity is the mother of invention, and thats a lesson well learned by these woman.Lori Ann Libbyauthor ofThe Adventures of Henry hamper and the Flying Fish"
5,Chair Aerobics for Everyone,Chair Aerobics for Everyone is an excellent DVD for a person who cannot stand for long but who wants to get aerobic exercise. I use it regularly.
4,This skateboard is so cool,I bought this skateboard for my 12 year old grandson and he loves it. He's broken a few discount store boards (even tho he's not heavy at all)so I wanted a little better quality board. He has been very happy with this skateboard.
4,Good beginning board,"I would recommend this board to anyone just starting out. The trucks are decent, but they did break after a couple weeks."
1,Don't buy this board if you want to do tricks,"My dad bought me this board and it stinks. It has no pop, the shape is terrible, and it's heavy. The wheels are hard as rocks and the bearings are slow. I guess if you're just rolling around it's ok but don't buy this if you want to do any kind of tricks. Some other guys are sticking up for this board, but I doubt they actually know how to skate because this Zon board is not good for much."
4,"It s perfect,but","this board rocks,for those stupid punks who say it sucks burn in hellfist thing its bearings are precision and so fast and not ABEC3,second it has excelllent pop for people who can REALLY pop boards and ollies not for stupid people saying lies stupider than their own brains,third the trucks are perfect they turn really good,the griptape is so good and the graphic is very cool.i agree with the reviewer who stated that its kingpinnuts were made from a cheap metal that strips,i was disappointed when i discovered it ,so buy new nuts for every thing"
4,was my first reel board,"This was my first real skateboard that I had when I started skating. I think its pretty good for the price. The bearings are smooth the decks pretty good. the only thing thats a little cheap on this board is the trucks. Other than that I think its a good starter board, or even for intermediate rider."
4,This board is good!,Well i have been skateboarding for a couple and i think the andy mac zon board is perfect for a person who is considering starting skating. I think if you have been skating for a long time you might want to make a couple changes to the board before you go out and rip. Otherwise i think it is a pretty good board
1,Ricky says don't do it!,"I bought this board for my brother, Ricky, and he hates it. Ricky and his pal Steve skate at my mom's house every day. Thwy always looked up to Andy Mac until now because he's extreme and he drinks Sobe and Ricky and Steve are always looking to score a rush just like Andy Mac. Ricky was bummed because when he tried to do his favorite trick on the Andy Mac board (Frontside Noseslide) it was a complete disaster. Me and Steve tried it to but this board is terrible. What a waste of money. If you want to score an extreme rush don't buy from Andy Mac or you'll be bummed."
1,don't do it,man.. this dude doesn't even go over the lip hardly... this is sickening. i can't believe someone who has made a career out of this has stooped to this level of BS..... buy a real skateboard from a real skateshop. don't do it!!!
4,GOOD For STREETS,"Ok, first of all, I bought the same board as this from a Cosco. I LOVED the thing like a child, untill a hick took it out of my garage and broke it. Snapped the deck in half with a sledgehammer, because this won't break easily. He did it on perpose. So now i'm thinking, do I get the same on or buy a nicer board like a zero, flip or element. I went to a website and bought everything you need to build your own. Only problem is, I HAVE NO F'EN IDEA HOW TO ASSEMBLE A F'EN SKATEBOARD. (The outcome sent me flying down a hill on three wheels) So, i buy this, and i'm doing great so far. Only thing is, dosent do too good on ramps. Stick to the street with this dawgie!"
1,Not worth the trouble.,The headset requires a sound card that supplies phantom power to the microphone or an additional power supply to be purchased from Labtec. Nothing on the packaging mentions this requirement! None of the 4 computers in my home office were compatible with the Axis-502 headset and the Labtec website offers a very limited FAQ list with very vague answers. The boom mic on mine is floppy and will not stay in place during use.
2,Good sound but been through 2 pair that broke,"I loved the sound quality of these headphones for the price, and the microphone was not too bad. The only problem I have had though, is that I am on my second broken pair. The volume control device keeps failing. I think wires inside the volume control are actually breaking. When I play with it for a while I finally get sound, but otherwise there they have completely stopped working. Last time a pair broke on me with the same issue, I called technical support and immediately after telling the rep. the problem, she said they would replace them without me even sending in the broken ones. That says to me, they must have been aware of the problem, and it must be a common problem."
2,look elsewhere,"I've had these for about two years and the mic has never worked well... I almost had to ""eat"" the microphone in order for people to hear what I was saying. I know of some other headsets on the same price range that work a lot better than these ones (Labtec)"
3,"Not the best, but great.","I don't know why you guys call this a piece of junk or w/e. I had this for maybe a month, and I switched to a better headset, not because it broke, but I wanted something better for gaming. The earphones were great, but, ya your right, i had to ""eat"" the MIC, too, in order for people to hear me CLEARLY. Overall, this is an ""O.K."" product."
4,A decent book,"This is a fairly comprehensive book. This is not the best ""beginner"" book. The ""beginner"" info is in there - but it's mixed with so much advanced stuff that it can seem overwhelming. If you have previous experience, there's a lot of good stuff here. This is an excellent ""second book."""
5,The Future is here.,"The future is Javascript. Being a Microsoft technologies fanatic, I always wanted to make use of the AJAX library. My javascript needed some brusing and this was the book I went after. The complete reference, and a good companion to HTML/XHTML Complete Reference. David Flaganan's book is good too. Both deserve 5 stars."
4,Very good book,"This book is quite unique and different from any other book that I have seen for the topic of waves in solids. The author's incorporation of modern computational methods is a welcomed change from the standard texts. In addition the author focuses concepts and solutions that are more relevant to structures, which is rare."
4,This is a DVD not a CD,"I ordered this item with the understanding it is a audio compact disc. Turns out not to be the case. This is a DVD. It contains the Iron Butterfly performance on the German TV show ""Beat Club"" from early 1971. The personnel and song selections are the same as on the group's 5th album ""Metamorphosis"". These same performances were included on the Iron Butterfly video cassette released by the Rhino label in the 1990s. This is a NTSC region-free DVD. It is a high quality item and appears to be licensed from the content's owner. Since it turned out to be a DVD it is actually more than I anticipated."
1,"bad cd, very dissapointed with my purchase.","i bought a cd from this seller and the cd doesn't have back insert and the original jewel case is missing. she replaced it with a cheap thin case. this is completely unacceptable specially for collectors like me who wants everything to be original. few people have complained about the same thing, check her feedbacks. if she has to do this on every cds she sell, she needs to put it on the description and her price needs to match what she is actually selling because buyers like me are getting surprised because of this."
2,Keep in mind what you paid,"Cable worked fine for about a week then would cause flickering to occur. Really annoying when you're playing a game and the inputs try to switch on you (my tv does that when it doesn't detect a cable). Definitely not the seller's fault and I'd purchase from them again. Fast shipping. I received the cable faster than I was told I would. Just keep in mind, you get what you paid for. I went out and bought another component cable and it works just fine with no flickering."
4,Improvement but not HD,"My family likes the WII but the resolution on a HD TV is poor without these cables. Once you purchase them, The picture is better, but not by much."
4,Does what it should,"This cable does what it should: It betters the resolution from the Wii, to make gaming crisper, and watching Netflix movies much less of a let-down. What more do you want?"
2,You get what you pay for,I didn't expect much for under $4 for a cable. I got even less then I expected. The cable drops colors if it is barely touched. You need to position it just right so all color signals are sent and hope it doesn't move.
1,Didn't work...meh,"The cable didn't work. I think I just got a lemon. I bought a more expensive one at a different store which did work. However, even after changing the mode to progressive in the Wii settings, it did not greatly improve the picture quality. It was better but not by much. This was on a Samsung LN52A750.If you have a big HD TV and a Wii, you will not get a great picture. What this cable will help most with, is the delay or ""lag"" you experience when playing a game on a HD TV. This is especially true if your TV does not have a special mode for playing Video Games.Good luck!"
4,"does the job, that's all i need!","well, i always warn people before they buy the wii - ""its not PS3""and this is the same situation.the Wii doesnt try to do HD - the focus is on the gameplay!and as long as you remember that, you'll be very happy.so dont expect this cable to turn your wii into a mean HD machine - but you should expect an improvement over the cable you got with your wii.for the price? this is VERY recommended.enjoy your wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!"
4,Wii Component Cable,"Works fine good and clearer much noticable resolution. Not as good at HD at 1080, but close, and much better than stock cable. Get it, worth the price."
5,Great cable set,Bought these to upgrade from standard composite cables. This is only real option to improve video on the Wii.Have it going through Yamaha aventage receiver which upgrades signal through hdmi.Quality of this cable set is OEM grade.
5,Not a Game just cables,"The cables definitely made a difference on my HDTV, and shipping was a lot quicker than I expected."
1,Defective Garbage,"This is the first defective equipment I have ever received from Amazon or one of their vendors. Of the five component input cables, only three of them worked! I went out and bought the full price Nintendo certified one instead. I'm working with the vendor to get a full refund and will update this note once I find out if they will refund me my money.I do NOT recommend it."
2,Not very good at all...,"I'm sure everyone know the difference between Analog and Digital signals.Analog signals you can picture as waves, while digital are 1's and 0's. (On and off).Component Cables are a medium for Analog signals, and Analog signals require really good shielding. Otherwise, you will get major interference from any other cables or machines that will induce interference onto the cable.This cable did really poor for me, because every once and a while I would get some snow-like interference every once in a while. I could really tell when playing Resident Evil 4.I would definitely recommend getting Nintendo brand component cables. I'm sure they have a really good quality shielding on their cables.I wish Nintendo moved to high definition Digital cables like hdmi. Because Digital cables do not require much shielding like Analog does.The only reason this product 2 stars is because it was incredibly cheap."
2,Not worth the money,"I have a 62"" HD 1080p television, yes it will do 480p. Not much of a difference if any difference was noted."
2,Did not work - inadequate shielding?,"This did not work!! Plugging in the Audio R cable creates a buzzing/humming noise when the TV is played. Guess there there is not enough shielding.Don't buy this, even though it is cheap. I use it only one audio cable plugged in."
1,WII HD Cables,"I bought the WII HD cables and saw no difference whatsoever in my pictures quality. I do not have the newest TV on the market by any means, but it is HD and I can see a noticable difference when my DVD or cable box is hooked up to component video or not.On the good side, I found the HD cables on monoprice and only paid about $5, so no real damage done. Don't pay the full price, do some searching online and you can find them significantly cheaper."
1,Barely lasted a month.,"We got this cable for the Wii and started using it on Christmas day. By the end of January the picture was cutting out and the colors were totally off. Terrible, cheap product. You get what you pay for."
2,Wii Component Cable,"This cable provides a much better picture than the composite cable, but there is one problem: Little squiggly lines appear on the screen as if there is some sort of noise interfering with the signal. They must not be shielded that well. Pretty much what I would expect for the price though..."
2,Cheap Price Bad Quality,It's cheap and you get cheap quality. The screen blanks out from time to time when these cables are connected which is very annoying.
2,"Good price for the product, but could not tell the difference","Bought these component cables to get HDTV quality on the games vs the standard RCA cables that came with the Wii. I have a 48"" LCD TV and could not tell the difference between the original RCA cables Vs these component cables."
2,It's cheap and low quality,The cords make the picture look even worse. Pay a little bit more and get a better picture.
2,Cable not needed,"Our new wii (xmas) only has SD resolution and dull colors on our HD giant screen. So I bought this cable. Forget it. No difference. Seriously, 480,,,,P? Anything at 480 is dull! I'm embarrassed that I bought this cable."
4,"Great Price!, works as it should, but not as awesome PQ as I had hoped","So it works as it should, price is awesome, but 480p is just not as great at I hoped. I guess I should have got an 360 if I wanted HD quality eh? One thing, make sure you change the video setting on your Wii, or you really won't notice a difference... :)"
5,Fixed my HDTV Lag!,"My HDTV had lag when using the normal Wii composite cable, so I bought this cable. The lag is almost completely gone now. The image quality is perfect, so rest assured that these are quality cables."
1,Didn't last 10 minutes,"For only $6 I figured I would give these cables a try, but they didn't work at all. Within 10 minutes of being connected the picture was cutting out. When adjusting the connectors we could temporarily get picture, but without color."
3,Good but not that good,"It was shipped with in the time limit. Got it to hook up to our HD Tv but with the Wii, it will not go wide screen. But the product is good."
2,Cheap,"This cord worked fine on my 32""TV. However, I also needed it to work on my projector screen. The cord made the screen flicker on and off. I ended up returning it and spending the extra money on a Monster cable, which works great."
2,Unfortunately it was worse than OEM cables,"I was so excited to receive these cables, they seemed like the best deal for the price. Ratings were excellent which causes me to wonder if I received a defective set (although how complicated are these things really? they either work or they don't). Sadly the video quality was worse than the cables that come with the Wii. Most notably, the color is drab and faded, everything else seems to be equal with the OEM cables. And while I didn't have terribly high expectations, it seems reasonable to expect that they would provide at least equally good picture quality to the standard cables that came with the Wii. I would definitely look at some other cables, perhaps one from a known brand."
3,Great color but no instructions,"I just purchased this product, so I don't have a long history . . . but so far so good. The picture for my Wii game has improved and it was worth the price. However, I gave it 3 stars because there are NO instructions (otherwise I would have given it 4 stars). For helpful tips on connecting it I went to [...] and was finally able to make it work."
4,Great add-on for anyone with an HDTV.,"Makes the picture a bit clearer, worth it if you own any type of HD or ED TV. Don't forget to enable the 480P setting once you get this connected to your HD/ED TV."
4,"Inexpensive, effective component cables",Not a whole lot to say about this item. It's inexpensive and improves the output of your Wii. I can't imagine paying $20-$30 for cables. This is a great deal.
5,Great quality,"really notice the difference with this cable component, this takes you to the highest quality of your TV, the quality is great for games with many special effects or to simulate real life."
1,"Cheap, Poor Quality","I bought this really for one game, but this really is a joke. It's of poor construction and actually displayed the picture worse, with several fast moving lines. Not caused by interference with other cords, it is the cord itself that is the issue."
4,Great HDTV Cables,Bought this mainly for making Monster Hunter 3 look better. Makes the monsters more clearer and colorful which is great. Although it does make me lag sometimes online. Guess it's my hdtv and the fps it has that is doing it. But anyway great cables!
2,not a good idea,"Im not much for name brand but after buying this after market cable I am all sold for name brand. it does matter I guess this cable did not give the quality picture I was expected, I went to target and bought one for 27 dollars and wow, blew my mind at how different it looks. I guess it all comes down to this, ""you do get what you pay for"""
1,Cheap connectors,"Received item and it looked perfect. Started plugging the connectors into the back of my tv and one of them broke. The center piece of the connector actually broke in the plug of the tv. After reviewing the connector, I noticed it was made of plastic with a very cheap thin chrome around it.Would not recommend this for anyone. Here, you get what you pay for. I have not yet been able to remove the broken connector from inside my plug on the tv."
2,Cable does not work with Epson 3010 projector,Cable doesn't work with projectors. You get a Not Supported message. Bought 2 and had the same problem. Went to a nicer cable and works fine now.
2,Defective units,"It seems a bunch of these cables are defective. Mine worked alright, other than the static that would scroll up the screen constantly. Cables aren't shielded and this may lead to the static."
4,Exactly what I wanted for half the price,"Item works as described. have a Vizio HDTV (47"" 120hz LCD)....You can tell a littledifference with the 480p. It's worth the money and savings---friend had brand name cord and we can't tell difference. He paid twice what I did at the store for the Nintendo brand cord"
4,Works well on my TV,"Cables work great. Not the highest definition, but definitely helps some games look better and not pixely."
5,"Yes, it's 480p. So what?","Yes, it's 480p. So what?When I played Zelda pre-component cable, it looked good. There's no point here in comparing to the XBOX 360 or PS3, because they aren't TRYING to do HD...However, when I put the component cables on, I noted an immediate improvement in the detailing of the game. It's not true HD, but it definately improves what you see when you are on a HD TV. I would recommend this to anyone."
1,Poor audio and video,"I bought this as an upgrade to the standard av cable supplied with Wii. Although the connections were easy, the video quality is not as good as the standard cable (horizontal lines pulsating on the screen) and the audio buzzes unbearably. I changed settings within Wii to look for something that would make the cable acceptable and also tried another component input on my Panasonic Viera HD TV but nothing helped.From the many other positive reviews, mine may be a lemon but it doesn't work properly and I would advise caution for other shoppers."
4,worked as expected,Notice that it improves the image but it is not a big improvement the wii is not 720p but with the regular cable i prefer this one you will notice more clarity and definition it is good
2,Broke in the Wii after Two Years,"I bought this generic Wii component cable because the price was right. However, as is usually the case, you get what you pay for. After about two years of use the plastic head of the cable that connects with the Wii broke inside the unit, requiring needle-nose pliers to remove it. Not good! It is made of a cheap construction quality. While the component video and audio quality was decent, and better than the RCA cable connection, it was not worth the pain of the head breaking off in the Wii. I replaced it with the more expensive better constructed Monster Component Cable. This proved to be of much better quality, as well as picture and audio quality. While the price is definitely good, I cannot recommend it based upon my experience with it."
1,never buy cheap!,"I ordered this HDMI video cable for the Wii thinking I was getting a great deal. We got it in and set it up, and the screen on the TV is green and the sound is weird. Next time I will not try to save money by getting a HDMI cable for six bucks!!I do not reccomend this video cable, save your money and buy one that's more expesnive."
1,Serious color issues,"Buying this cable turned out to be a bit of false economy on my part, due to some strange color issues. For example, reds appeared olive (very odd to see green brake lights on cars, for example), light blues appeared purple, etc. I replaced it with a Rocketfish cable, which works great."
1,You only get black and white picture with this cable,"The one I received didn't work for me, I didn't get color picture with this cable, plus this cable caused the game disc rattling in my WII console. Must be returned. Won't recommend it to my friends."
3,A Glimpse of Paddington,"A book for Babies and Toddlers, Paddington Bear Goes to Market gives a short story that catches the excitement of Paddington Bear's morning shopping. Good uses of repetition and rhyme makes this book very appealing to a younger audience. This was used in a toddler storyhour and the children enjoyed this book. The illustrations, done in watercolors, give great detail which allows for more discussion on the book."
1,this was a fake.,"was not the real product. my husband uses curve aftershave balm for years, but I always bought it in department stores. When I got this one one on amazon, it gives him skin irritation when he put it on . He tried few times just to make sure it was this product. so sad"
2,Not great but what can you expect for 17 bucks,Not great. Rattles and has cheap feel and threads. Sort of blurry also. Not much use. You get what you pay for.
3,Useful for lunar imaging,I bought this so that I could get more of the moon into view with the Celestron NexImage camera.The Bad:Quality control is pretty poor on this item. The threads aren't very precise or cross-threaded (perhaps the Neximage) so I couldn't tighten down the lense to the bottom of the Neximage. I also see something hanging from the side of one of the internal elements in a manner that partially overlaps the lens element.The Good:This thing is dirt cheap at $24.
2,Not for the (NexImage 5) for use on the older Neximage only,"No instructions, I found the info on Celestron's website after it didn't fit the (Neximage5). I thought it was for the (Neximage5) Wrong ! it's for the older Neximage only. For my new (Neximage5) I will use Celestron #94175 f/6.3 Reducer on my Celestron NexStar it works. Trying to figure this out after It was a buy this item also or together (sugestion) was a mistake. Don't let it happin to you. Good thing was it was only 18 bucks."
4,Does the trick.,Helps you get a better image with the 5 mp imager. I recommend having it in your kit just in case.
3,"Not a life changing album, but worth a listen to anyone who enjoys their genre.","Considering the fact that i had no interest in this band or album, it is a great cd.I originally ordered it for my little brother's birthday. However, when i put the album onto ITunes and gave it a listen, i was rather pleased. Their fast paced sound is really refreshing, especially considering their label as an ""emo band"". The vocalist's singing style was at first annoying to me, but i after a while it grew on me. its a very distinguishable sound. The only reason that i give it 3 stars is that it isnt a style that i absolutely love. However, anyone interested in modern punk or screamo should definitively give it a listen."
2,"OK for the price, durability concerns","I bought this laser printer in 2007, for light-duty printing in my home business. By the time it was 18 months old, it gave me an error message and had to be repaired. My local Xerox repair place was able to repair it, but the image quality has continued to go significantly downhill. It now as a white streak throughout the page. I'm still using it for my own use, but I'd rather not give these printouts to a client. I'm hoping to get it to last until I use up the replacement toner cartridges I bought. Unfortunately, it is a fairly large piece of equipment to treat as a disposable. I'm disappointed from an environmental point of view that it just doesn't last. In short, really, in the end, a piece of junk."
2,Died after 18 months,"We're in the process of replacing this printer since it just died. We have a small office with 3 employees. We had this printer set up on our ethernet network. Initial setup went well, and when we ran into a problem, Xerox's support was marvelous. This printer, when it worked, was great for our common black-and-white print jobs and occasional color jobs. The speed and color quality are both unremarkable, but that's what we expected with a $350 color laser printer. After 18 months, we turned on our printer which then displayed ""Error 14- Transfer Roller."" Xerox told us this would require a technician to repair, which is far more expensive than the printer is worth. (We didn't have a service agreement since that was also more than the printer was worth). I would avoid this printer in favor of newer, more effective printers that cost about the same but have much better options and print quality."
4,Not as good as NBA 2K6,"Good game, but the game has a few flaws. First of all you can't drive into the lane in this game which made NBA 2k6 better already,2nd of all the good shooters for some reason don't seem to make 3's, but other than that this game is very good."
3,So-so,"This game is average at best. I've played a few season and just am kind kinda sick of playin'. The recruting in season is an awesome options but I think it just gets old. You have to scout and email, visit, call the recruits every week. At first, I thought this was great, but it sucks after a while. When you forget to talk to the targeted player one week, some other team might shoot in front of ya in the players interested list. Then, its tough to win him back. You look at doin' this when there are players in high school. Thats 4 yrs of recruiting..Ick! Otherwise, gameplay is decent. Seems like gameplay is full of errors at time...But, thats just me :)"
5,FOOL AGAIN IS BRILL!,"THIS WESTLIFE SONG IS DIFFERENT 2 THE 1 ON THE ALBUM BUT I LOVE IT. I ALSO LOVE THE B SIDE ""TUNNEL OF LOVE"" THIS WAS A RECORD BREAKING SINGLE IT WAS THEIR 5TH CONSECUTIVE NUMBER 1 AND I BET THEIR 6TH GOES TO NO 1 TO...I HOPE. THEY R REALLY GOOD SINGERS THEY SOUND SO GOOD LIVE. I WILL BE SEEING THEM LIVE AT MANCHESTER IN 2001."
4,All we know is what came before...,"In the context of punk rock, all we have is the past to guide us. However, Skull Kontrol ditched this aesthetic to look into the future instead. How non-punk of them. Feedback noise has never sounded so good. This four-piece thrash through six songs with defiant, reckless fury. Too bad they broke up shortly after this EP was released."
2,Be careful,The speaker wire connects via the holes in the side. There is not a way to insert them through the bottom. The picture and description didn't make this clear. I didn't like the way that made everything fit to my speakers so I returned them.
1,Horribly Overrated,"Princess Superstar is ONLY getting attention because she is white and female. She may be alright compared to bad commercial rap, but to anyone who listens to good hip-hop, it's obvious that she is a flake. Her rhymes are generic and stupid, and she has no rhythm or delivery. There are some good guest MCs like High & Mighty and J-Zone, but they are not enough to make this record listenable."
2,Am I Missing Something??,"I don't see the big deal about Princess Superstar. She's ok, but not great. The album has its moments, but most of it is just average. If you want to hear funnier rhymes with better producton and more interesting beats, I recommend the Latino-Jewish rap group Hip Hop Hoodios and their ""Raza Hoodia"" CD. ..."
1,wickedy wack....,"Princess Superstar seems to have gotten a lot of attention for this release...I guess the mindless public will tire of gimmicks. Her topics are pseudo clever rhymes about sex, being a bad..., sex, fantasy and sex. Guess what...sex sells. And I am not trying to be mean...but she is not even hot! If you are a fan of hip hop or good music in general..I doubt you would even consider buying this...don't get fooled by the hype."
1,NOT a good rap cd or a good comedy cd.,"PRINCESS SUPERSTAR is ... a bland unfunny white comedian rapper chick that sounds like shes doing voice over work for the phone company. the comedy skits are bad, the raps are bad, the beats are bad, the production is bad. i cant think of a single reason to recommend this cd.there are lots of funny female MCs, so its easy to avoid this stinker."
2,Somethin's Wrong!,"Princess Superstar may be the first white to enter rap but let's face it! She ain't that good. I mean some of her lyrics are real nonsense. I use to think this record was tight but what changed my mind is how much blaspheme she uses. I mean it's God this and God that and on Untouchable Part 1 she say's ""readily, I'd say I was bigger than Jesus"" and this really puts a low down for all the other Jewish people. She don't know what she doing. Sometimes it sounds like she's trynna imitate Lil' Kim and be the white version of her but it doesn't work. The only tracks which I think are aiight are: Super Fantasy, Wet!Wet!Wet!, We Got Panache, Untouchle Part 2 and Too Much Weight. Otherwise this album fails. If you thinkin' of coppin' this rather borrow it from someone!"
4,STILL THE MASTER,Mr. Turnbull is the best author in his field. He continues to shed light on a topic long ignored by military and non-miltraty historians.
2,Won't help you become a better photographer.,"Much of the information in this book is not specific to black and white photography. It is very generic and could serve as the introduction to a broader book on the topic. The chapters on composition and the ""zone system"" are disappointingly thin, and there are very few photographs within the book to serve as illustrative examples supporting the text. The paper is of mediocre paperback quality, which makes the few photographs within the book look washed out and featureless. The author says this material is collected from his years of teaching the subject; I'd hate to be one of his students."
3,A little too technical for me.,"Because I am a novice photographer and do not have my own darkroom, I found this book too complex and technical, and therefore, returned it. However, with that said, it appeared to be a good book for those who do have a dark room and are more interested in the technical aspect of black and white photography. It has few photos and its basic outline is that of a textbook. Giving the book only three stars is MY rating but probably doesn't accurately rate the book. Take time to preview the book on line to see if it meets your needs."
2,Wast of money,Liftmasters garage door openers are great what happened!! This product constantly lose connection and I have to keep unplugging it and plugging for it to reconnect to see if my garage was accidentally left open.
3,Garage Door Monitor,"I made the assumption of thinking this monitor had an audible alert, it doesn't. Its simple to use though. Place the sensor on the garage door and place the monitor in the house, somewhere visible, because they way you will know that the door is open is to see the LED light go from green to red. It should really have an audible alert. I have multiple garage doors so I need additional sensors which are hard to come by and cost more than the monitor and sensor together."
1,Doesn't work,We bought two of these. Ours never worked right. We had to keep moving the monitor closer to the garage even though the distance was listed to work correctly. It just keeps blinking green and red. It will stay red sometimes if the door is open and the weather is good. We placed it by the back door and that didn't work either. We can just look outside so this is useless. The second one is in our daughter & son-in-law's garage which is attached to their house. Theirs worked for a little longer but now is malfunctioning too.
1,Waste of money,"The sending unit is a piece of junk. Several times I have had the sending unit send false information, showing the door open when it was closed, and vice versa. A good rap on the sender corrected the situation. Seems like the sensor got stuck. This thing is only a few months old. It's unreliable, which defeats the purpose. It's a waste money. Yes, it's installed correctly.I should return it, but it's not worth the effort and expense.Save your money."
2,after 3 hrs..got it to work..kinda,3 hrs of playing with it.......works if 32 feet apart...but not 35 feet....had to set and reset units to each other..they would not work out of the box..i followed instructions...got it to work when next to each other...then after i installed on garage door..set reciever up where i wanted it...would not work..had to move it 3 feet closer to garage door...now it is in my hall..not where i wanted it..would not buy it again
2,Not right for me,I have a detached garage and couldn't get it to work in the house. This might work ok for you if you have an attached garage with very little room between the sender and receiver.
1,Liftmaster Garage door monitor,"This looked like the perfect thing for us as we often go to bed and wonder if the garage doors are open. Our master bed/bath is directly above the garage. Unfortunately, the liftmaster still has problems getting a signal from the sensors on the garage doors. It works perfectly if the monitor is on the same level as the garage and just a few feet from the garage doors. But in our bedroom (only about 25 ft. from the sensors), it works intermittently. I can be in our bedroom and raise and lower the doors with a small transmitter. So, it should be possible to get a strong enough signal from the garage doors to the bedroom with a small transmitter.It's a really good idea and such a simple concept. Too bad it just doesn't work well."
1,"Range maybe 200 CENTIMETERS, not 200 feet","Placed 20 feet from the sensor, with only one frame wall in between, the unit failed to receive a signal. Does not work in a real world setting. Returned."
3,works some of the time,"If there are more then 2 walls between the garage door and your monitor base unit, it just isn't going to work all the time. My monitor is about 25', including 2 walls, from the door sensor and even after installing a 2nd new battery, I will get false readings especially at night when it is cold in the garage."
3,No Range-Great idea,It struggles to reach the kitchen which connects to the garage..If I move it to the far end it looses connection..Might try a new battery
2,Limited Range,"It's a good product, but nowhere in the product literature does it say that it has a limited range. Just 25 feet. Do not count on 1 foot more. My garage door on my detached garage is about 35 feet from my house. Even though there is a clear view from the garage door to the house, there is no signal. Inside of that range, the product works fine."
5,It tells you if the garage door is open.,"Before I go to bed at night, I look at the light and see if the door is open. If so, I use a spare remote to close it from my bedside table. If the %@(*&@?! cat runs in and breaks the beam, I see that the light did not go green, and I close it again. No more walking downstairs to check on and close the door."
4,Limited Range Fix,"This unit does indeed have a limited range and didn't work at my night stand about 60 feet away. In despreation, I increased the antenna length from what I assumed is quarter wavelength (9"") to 36"" by attaching 27"" of wire to the end of the existing antenna. I now have a good signal lock and the unit works as expected."
3,Liftmaster 915LM Garage Door Monitor,"The Liftmaster 915LM Garage Door Monitor, doesn't always work. I have two doors being monitored and at times when both are closed, the monitor blinks the red light at times, so I have to physically check the doors which are on a detached building. Opening and closing one of the doors seems to reset the monitor and the green light is switched on."
1,SJ Discount Tools absolutely terrible,I have recently had to unfortunate experience of dealing with SJ Discount Tools also known as Great Deals Inc. I would never buy from this company again. I ordered several items from them and received only one after writing to Paypal for help. I have been billed for 4 items only one of which I have received. Their communication in only in the form of automated e-mails that do nothing but delay the inevitable of not receiving your items. I have filed a disputed with my card company and would not recommend buying from them.
5,Moov,I have been very satisfied with moov. It relieves muscular pain. It is absorbed into the skin so it does not stain clothing. It does have a fairly strong odor but the odor dissipates quickly.
1,Price isn't competitive,"The steak knives are nice, however I bought the same, exact set of knives at Target for $19.99. Unfortunately, the knives were a closeout item, otherwise I would go back to Target to purchase a second set."
5,A deftly woven and lovely picturebook story,Young readers ages 4-10 will find Wishing Tree by Roseanne Thong to be a deftly woven and lovely picturebook story set in modern Hong Kong and telling of a young boy and his grandmother who visit a rural temple's Wishing Tree every lunar New Year. Connie McLennan's realistic drawings enhances a story which tells how a wishing tree helps a youngster solve common problems in life.
3,Good beat to walk to,"I listen to the tape when I do my daily treadmill walk. It has a funky rhythm that keeps you moving and, if you follow the beaet with your steps, you get a good workout. As for the peaceful, meditative state promised...I'm not sure. Sure, I feel good after my workout, but I am not sure if it is from the ""brainwave"" adjustment, or the physical workout itself. I am planning to try another one of her tapes, so while I'm not completely convinced, I admit some satisfaction with this tape. We'll see once I try another of Kelly Howell's tapes."
5,Wow,"Great album, gave it to my little brother and he (about 62 now) loves it too. The Major was a major pop artist when we were growing up and his stuff is hard to find."
5,It really works!,This is a great product. I was amazed at how good the golf balls are. I was hitting the ball long and stopping it on the greens. And the gun really works. I did not loose a ball yesterday and I played with the Radar ball all round! I probably saved 3 strokes. I highly recommend it!
5,"A ""Must Read"" for thoughtful ""travelers"" and Trekkers alike.","I found this book filled with the kind of character building contemplations which make the application of ""right actions"" possible in our daily lives. A complimentary volume to Roberts and Ross' ""Make It So"". the author employes quotes from ""Star Trek"" episodes as insightful launching points for consideration of many of life's deeper questions.

1,THIS PRODUCT IS NOT FOR CHILDREN!!,"(I only gave this one star because I had to in order to post this message!) This product is NOT for children, and the labeling is misleading. DO NOT GIVE THIS PRODUCT IF YOUR CHILD IS RUNNING A FEVER!! It is NOT indicated for teething relief, or for the relief of any fever!!This product contains salicylic acid (aspirin) and salicylates are linked with triggering Reye's Syndrome a potentially lethal disease for children under the age of 19.Reye's Syndrome, a deadly disease, strikes swiftly and can attack any child or teen without warning. All body organs are affected, with the liver and brain suffering most seriously. While the cause and cure remain unknown, research has established a link between Reye's Syndrome and the use of aspirin and other salicylate containing medications, over the counter products, and topical use products.Please see ReyesSyndrome.Org for more information."
1,Heidi La Nina De Los Alpes Vol 2,"This movie has over 20 episodes and after watching the 5th episode the disc would not play anymore, I tried paying it on the computer and on another DVD player but did not have any luck. Since I didn't review the disc before the 30 day warranty I'm out of luck now. If anyone has purchased this movie before and worked fine I would like to know because I would really like to get a better qualify one but I'm hesitant on doing so now. By the way the volume on the movie had very poor quality it would go up and down and had a lot of static."
1,Horrible Video,"I got 2 videos, one for a gift, and one for me, the videos are all pirate copies. I wish the person to be honest, and not be selling stuff like this. I love the show in it self, but the quality is horrible. I was embarrassed to give this as a gift. Please stop selling those videos."
1,Hard to rate what I did not receive.....,Didn't recieve the product I ordered. Attempted to email the seller to get correct item and work something out and never received feedback. Sent the item back and am hoping to receive credit. Thank God it was not a high dollar item.
3,A SWASHBUCKLING DELIGHT - HOWEVER.....,"(NOTE: This review is for the Instant Video format of SEVEN SEAS TO CALAIS)SEVEN SEAS TO CALAIS is a wonderful '62 swashbuckling adventure, and Rod Taylor gives a good performance as ""Sir Francis Drake"", (also starring Keith Mitchell (from Murder She Wrote) as ""Malcolm Marsh""), however....the picture quality of this Instant Video offering leaves a LOT to be desired. I felt like I was watching my old 8 mm home videos (that we used to project on to the wall during family birthday parties in the late '50s, early '60s!) with the dingy yellowish/brown 'washed out' hues and 'artifacts' throughout. It's a 480P presentation, but it sure doesn't look like it. Attempting to enlarge was met with disasterous results - this is better suited when left with the smaller image. Hopefully this will get a remastered job someday - it deserves it!5 stars for entertaining storyline - 1 star for picture quality.Closed Captioning is not included for the hearing impaired."
3,Wrong product for my job,I had a problem with the caulk adhering to a cold surface. Difficult to handle because it tended to stick to me and itself rather than the cold window.
5,Wave Wheels,Arrived on time and worked like a charm. Pretty easy to install. I put one on and my 13 year old put one on and the Wave rides like new.
4,Great collection,"I enjoyed browsing through this great collection of patterns. The difficulty is varied, so you can do something easy or try your hand at the blanket shown on the cover! The instructions assume you are familiar with terms, so if you are new to the craft keep a stitch dictionary handy. I recommend this one. A great addition to your pattern library."
2,Caution,I've been Crocheting for over ten years but a friend wanted me to make the Irish Lattis pattern. And I found a ton of mistakes. The way they have the pattern written does not match the picture at all and they tell you that the wrong side of the afghan is the right side sometimes. I wouldn't suggest getting this book unless you have a little more experience and can easily fix the problems otherwise you might get very confused with the instructions. I'm assuming since that pattern is so off there are mistakes in the other designs as well.
3,"Beautiful afghans, but be prepared for errors","I LOVE a lot of these patterns, and the first I have tried is the cover ""Blue Star"". A group of friends and I are all making it. It's a good thing we're working together, because we have found 3 LARGE errors in it that aren't in the company's ""corrections"". Even though we've notified them of these errors, they don't seem to have made it into the official set of corrections. It's frustrating to have to rip a lot of things out because of editing issues.MOST of these afghans are crochet, a few knit, and several are ""afghan stitch"" or tunisian."
5,Aspirin Is One Of The Biggest Wonder Drugs Of All Time,On risk/reward and affordability aspirin is one of best wonder drugs of all time. Aspirin can bring you many benefits with minimal side affects if used conservatively. There are many good books on Amazon which tell the exciting story of aspirin and how it can benefit your health. Just do a search for aspirin books and you will be amazed at the information available. Good health to you!
5,Great Music,"For any horslips fans this album won't disappoint. For anyone who doesn't know much of their stuff, I still think you'll enjoy this. If you like irish music and you like rock music then this is by far the best combination. Including classics like ""Flower Amang Them All"" and ""Dance to yer Daddy""."
3,SLow Service,Do not expect quick turn around with this vendor. It took over two weeks for them to ship after they acknowledged receipt of my order. It took another ten days for the product to reach me.
5,A very fun game,"If you are listening to all those people who say this game is bad,don't listen to them.This game is the best,it has good graphics and if you are a good gamer it is easy to play.It is two player and has lot's of bikes to chose from.It's a good game."
4,It's a good game,Ok this is the low down on Supercross 2000 for N64. I race Dirtbikes so I know how they act. It's Graphics are very very good The sound could be better and well sorry to say the Controlling is kinda sad. The game is made very well it tells about evey charcitor lets you make a player and you can do freestyle and racing. EA sports is one of my fave producers of games but they didnt do there homework on the turning. When you turn the bike kinda just sits and peels out. If you play the game for a while ( a long while) you start to figure out that you have to really slow down and use the clutch. Anyway for all you die hard video game fans that dont have this game yet I suggest you but it its made very well you can get used of the turning. But for all the rest of you If you really want a good game I suggest you waight untill Jermey MCgrath Supercross 2000 comes out I hear it's supposed to be exellent. But otherwise I suggest you get this game!
3,"Good pictures, bad text.","Nice blueprints and pictures, but a lot of discrepancies in the captions and descriptions...most of which have been mentioned in other reviews."
4,"A required tie-in book, unfortunately not a novelty","Andy Lane's book is the ultimate in Babylon 5 guides and the ""A-Z"" index is also a required reading to backup the former. What this book stands for ? It is a non original book (using the above two ones as reference) but provides the reader with enough backstory and technicalities to tie-up all the above into the Babylon 5 station itself. It can fascinate the reader with tech specs and photos of all known ships, guns, etc. plus all other procedures of living in Babylon 5 station. Also a nice insert are the VIP criminal records, the known space grid, a.o. As a publication is perfect making it the last required book for those dedicated Babylon 5 fans. If only it was a novel idea..."
3,Cheezy but kinda cool,This book is written from Micheal Garabalies point of view. It more opion then techinical infomraiton. It is cheezy in that it is supposed to be a Turn Over Binder covering SOP froma Cheif Warrent Officer to enlisted securisty personell; as a member of the military the cheesy dialog is unbalivble and distracting. Havign seaid that B5 kicks ass so this book is cool to have. It also has just enough techinical info to be cool
5,Fantastic game!,"This might be the best Reel Deal game yet. Graphics and fun level are at the max. Personally, I think this is Reel Deal's best game. I've never owned a slots game with so many bonus levels and so many surprises. Once again, thanks Reel Deal!"
1,very very frustrating,Would not load had to send disc's back. Now it keeps freezing up and you lose everything from that session. would not recommend this game. Also tech person was very rude.
3,Install problems,"I have problems with this game. I have installed, uninstalled and then had my son install it and still have problems with the game. I do not play online, only on my computer. I have had no problems with Mystic Forest."
1,It doesnt work right,I bought bonus mania at best buy and the game never has worked right for me. I have called support and all i got was no help.;I am very unhappy with the game. I haveReel Deal 1 and 2 and was looking forward to this one. If i have to uninstall and reinstall i will lose all my points i have got Susie
5,AtouchOfClass54,"I spend at least 10 hours a day on the REAL DEAL slots games on the ONLINE casino and all the games from PHANTOMEFX are the best that I have ever played. Each and every game they come out with are sooooooo much fun and challenging. The online setup has levels, your own suite, trials tournaments and much more. The time that I spend playing flies by so fast, many times I start playing at 5pm, and stay up to 4am. I say to myself, where did the time go? and also while driving from Naples to Miami each week which is an hour and 30 min drive, I am clicking away trying to make real world money on WILD APPLE, but don`t worry, my eyes are on the road!! which means I can`t stay away from this game. THESE SLOTS ARE THE WORLDS BEST.Come check out some snapshots of my winnings by going here[...]"
2,Reel Deal Slots Bonus,I was a little disappointed with this game. I have Reel Deal II and it plays much faster and has better slots. I bought this bonus game based on my first game.
5,The Best Yet,This company continues to put out fantastic games. I have all of them and they keep getting better and better. Bonus Mania is awsome. The graphics are great and the incentives have me addicted. This is a definate must buy!!
1,seriously?!,"I usually do not write reviews, but I had to on this one. I do not think it is ok that this is marketed as a children's medication. Children 17 and under are not supposed to take aspirin (unless prescribed by their dr for specific medical conditions) due to the risk of Reye's syndrome. Parents, DO NOT give children aspirin unless told to by their pediatrician!!!!!!"
5,touch up paint,this color was an exact match. I used the ball roller which take s a little finesse but gives good accuracy to fill small chips.
4,An Appreciation,"This DVD is ABC News' formal memorial to Peter Jennings. As a kid, I first watched Jennings in 1967 when he was the 27 year-old autodidactic anchorman going up against the well known titans at CBS and NBC. And in the late 1960's ABC was very much the last place youth network. This DVD is a snap shot of ABC News' transformation and growth over the last generation. Jennings' work transformed and grew with it. And this memorial shows that story."
3,"Not a compete waste of time, but...","This book assumes you already have a strong mathematical background and in finance as well. And unfortunately this book doesnt cover programming i Mathematica in a good way, but you get an overwiev of what can be done with Mathematica, standard functions and abilities and so on. But this stuff is already covered in a better way in eg. Mathematica Handbook. You get some ideas from this book, but its definitely not worth the price."
3,A Need for New Selections.,"I was disappointed to play the CD and discover that out of the 14 selections, only 5 were new when compared to the first CD. It would appear that this group needs to strengthen their repertoire. I enjoy their music, but feel that the customer is being cheated by having so many repeat selections when buying both of their CDs. Prices being what they are, this is not giving the customer the ""bang for their buck"". I still maintain that I enjoyed hearing their NEW selections & will be more aware of the contents of any future CD."
2,"Beautiful voices, I'm sure, but the music selections were drab","Had anticipated an ""Il Divo"" type recording - and ordered two different ones. Had heard about these tenors. Was SOOOoooo disappointed that the selections of music chosen were unfamiliar, totally, and really did not showcase the talent I'm sure was there. Give me Il Divo every time in comparison! Unfortunate, for it probably was not the tenors' fault."
2,Not Il Divo,"I am sure these guys can really sing, but the choice of songs did not showcase their talent. I should have just waited for Il Divo's new one, but I guess Bohemian Rhapsody made the purchase worthwhile, which to me was the only song that did them justice."
3,Life without interference,"Charlie Bradshaw, a PI, likes a life without interference. His friend Victor does not. Charlie's desire for freedom arises from his twenty years on the police force. A divorced man, Charlie has a friend, Janey Burris. Charlie goes to the police stations to look up the files on an old case of his because a body has been found on the construction site for a new library.The case had been closed as a missing persons case in the first instance. Reading his old notes, Charlie discerns that he had used a moral grid in working the case. He is tormented by something he calls the ambiguity of experience. Revisiting the old scenes, he is told by someone that shy people have a lot of anger. Investigating the case makes Charlie aware of his younger self. He questions his previous judgments and perceptions.This book is thoughtful verging on the philosophical. It doesn't have that typical American brassiness. It resembles the novels and stories of Agatha Christie."
4,Works well,Having a second battery is great. I really am not seeing much difference between the HTC standard battery and this one but it does the job.
4,Family Limited Partnerships,book is full of information and examples.. and tells how to go about it.. but doesn't get to all the nitty gritty.. its a good primer so you don't go to a lawyer cold. and gives good advice on some of the things that should be in the agreement.. but is not a state by state coverage and you will need more details about your state to complete anything but it gives a good reference in the back on what your looking for.
3,A sojurn in the Aussie wasteland of dry country,"Deep in Australian outback country, one boy struggles to find his place. Mirroring his struggle is a creature who is native and yet out of place - glimpsed and dreamed of, but never conclusively seen.He dreams of leaving the country and moving to the city, going to university, getting a job, anything to get away from the dry arid land, the father who won't communicate with him, and the futureless town.It's a dry slow book, and although Sonya Hartnett manages to imbue it with the same mystical feeling of her other books, such as Thursday's Child or The Black Foxes, is is more like the former than the later.Interesting but not riviting."
3,has it's moments,"This 'concept' album or whatever is a mixture of irish trad and rock. very tight and good musicianship, rocking arrangements. It has a repeating theme that is played every 2nd or third track, which becomes a bit annoying. There are some fine tunes like charloais dearg doom and time to kill. Pity there aren't more guitar solos on it, and i think it sags a bit in the middle"
3,Ok but not much of a rainstorm,"I collect thunderstorm and surf CDs. This was OK, but there were more animals, horses, cats and Cows making noise than rain. Don't get wrong it was pleasant, but the rain sounded like it was a loop, the same starting and stoping of the rain all the time. Not bad, but not the best. I could visualize the animals and smell the country air during the rain, so overall it was alright."
1,Horrible :(,"Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors and I can't recall another movie of his that I didn't like. This movie reminds me of a 3:10 to Yuma set in the woods... with horrible directing and/or acting.My main beef is with how Cusack's character treats Freeman. Let say you have a dangerous felon on your hands, you are armed, and your kid is with you, how many times are you going to get less than an arms length away on your own accord? If you can ignore Cusack's character being unintentionally stupid I think this could be worth a little entertainment value. Freeman is fine, but like I said, my attention was drawn to the blatant disregard for common sense. Take it for what it was worth, you might actually enjoy the movie."
2,Amazingly Poor,"As we watched this movie, we kept asking ourselves outloud... what the heck are Morgan Freeman and John Cusack doing in this film? This movie's writing smells of a bad 1980s made-for-tv thriller. I can't imagine how two of the best actors in Hollywood could have paired up in a movie that I found so disapointing. In most cases, these guys would carry even the weakest of movies and, to a small degree they do here, but it's just too poorly written and produced to recover. The rest of the casting also seems way off - maybe they're good actors but they have all been caught in a pretty awful movie. Forget for a moment the bad writing and awkward dialouge, the post-production was the worst I've seen in a major movie in a long time. There is one scene where a helicopter crashes and I could swear I was watching an episode of Dukes of Hazzard or something - cheesey slow-mo crash! Oh well."
2,Unintentionally campy. Terrible writing.,"Cusack has been in some so-so movies, but previously I would have given Freeman more credit than this. I hadn't read any reviews of this moving going in, but it quickly became clear the writing was aweful. This movie is bad: bad writing, unbelievable sequences, cliched characters, you name it. This movie reminded repeatedly me of those bad, low budget action movies you used to see a lot of in the 70's and early 80's - especially those made for TV. I did get a few kicks out of movie, but it was inevitably because the script was just so horrible. Did I mention the writing was aweful? Give it a pass."
3,could have been better,"This is a movie that I liked alot, but it suffers from a lack of good action directing and the beginning could have been a little tighter. Overall an enjoyable slow paced action thiller."
3,A good rental film,"This film was an alright film but not a movie that I would add to my movie collection unless it was given to me as a gift. I actually liked Cusack the best in this film..showed the better part of his acting capabilities, but was not a great choice for Freeman who didn't really fit well with this the movie. Idea of film was good but the writing an production lacked hugely which is why the film only got 3 stars from me. Would recommend this film to be watched only via rental."
2,Take out a contract on this movie,"Bad script. Incredibly disappointing as one is desperately craving intelligent and strategic thinking in a movie such as this, but it stumbles right out of the gate. I mean, Freeman would never have even gone off with Cusack in the first place, he would have just sat on his butt awaiting his associates. Also, all the rambo scenes with the gym teacher were way over the top. And let's not even talk about the ending where the coach and the two hit men all meet in the woods at the same instant, please. There's tons of other non-sequiters in this movie too. Freeman and Cusack must have really been bored to dive into this stinker."
1,What happens when a bad film happens to good actors...,"I'm a fan of both Morgan Freeman and John Cusack. But this film does them little justice. Mainly the poor script and amateur supporting cast ruin what could have been an interesting movie. Worth it to watch on a rainy day, for free. Do not pay to see this movie."
5,CONTRACT,"How can you go wrong with this all star cast? Cusack and Freeman. I have been a Cusack fan since Grosse Pointe Blank and can't say enough about Freeman. They play off each other well here. The blu-ray looks really good on this one, I was pleasently suprised with my purchase of this sleeper thriller."
1,Darn - what a disappointment. Worth the $0.99 I guess...,I never heard of this movie - preview here looked decent - I thought ehh - for $0.99 cents - it's got Freeman and Cusack in it - it's gotta be decent.Wrong. It was terrible. The basic story line was just fine. Execution acting - interaction - very poor. Honestly it was a 'B' movie at best. If you were hoping for a great or decent movie for your weekend - pass on this one.
2,Coulda; Shoulda,"I have read all the previous reviews, unfortunately after seeing the film. I am amazed that anyone would give it more than two stars-it made no sense whatsover-and there was no ending or any attempt at disclosing a ""plot"". The presence of Freeman and Cusick saves it from being a complete negative, but one suspects they will do anything for a buck, Bad, bad writing. I'd ask for my money back, but I saw it for free and even that was too much."
1,Horrid,"This movie is beyond bad. My friends and I made a movie as a joke when we were 19 that had better dialogue. The script/plot just does not make any sense whatsoever. When they revealed maybe a 1/3 of the way thru that Cusack was an ex-cop I was incredulous - my 3 year old daughter can hold a gun better than his character was. And then when he managed to to take out the spec-ops tracker that was chasing him with an automatic rifle? Sorry, no way. I don't think Freeman's acting was all that bad, but this movie really has no redeeming qualities (wait, I take that back - the Bulgarian scenery was stunning - yep, thats right, the outdoor scenes were filmed in BULGARIA!)"
1,"Bad acting, silly plot, despite decent cast","The Contract is a far-fetched, ill-conceived and way too predictable movie. I thought the premise and the combination of Cusack and Freeman might offer something decent, but this movie regurgitates way too many cliches and executes them poorly. The writing (and in many places the acting) is bad and makes it very difficult to try and maintain any suspension of disbelief -- the intended drama of ""trained professional killers in the woods chasing a man and his somewhat estranged son"" simply fizzles into nearly laugh-out-loud ludicrous, ""yeah, that's going to happen"" moments and implausible plot pieces seemingly thrown together without a cohesive plan."
3,Enjoyable popcorn thriller...,"Enjoyable if not derivitive thriller with perfunctory performances by leads Morgan Freemand and John Cusack. The storyline is thin, the characters are thin, but the film is beautifully shot, had some wonderful set pieces (the cliff scene) and some moments of nice suspense and action. A few of the action sequences are extremely well executed and surpisingly quite thrilling. On the downside, the movie definitely plays it too safe, there's certainly nothings screaming ""extraordinary"" in any sense, and is lacking verisimilitude. Still, it's a pleasant and very scenic journey, has some memorable moments, and John Cusack and Morgan Freeman even when only mediocre are still always fun to watch on screen."
2,Just too unbelievable,"I realize I must suspend disbelief some when I watch a movie but this movie was just too unbelievable even for a movie. People in serious car wrecks and escape without a scratch, 3 men in a helicopter crash that destroyed the helicopter and they all walk away. A guy doing precision shooting out of a bouncing helicopter. I couldn't even finish. Goes to show that two great stars can make a lemon movie."
5,Awesome movie in better packaging,"You can't beat a gripping action movie with 2 legendary actors, all in a Steelbook case. The Contract is well done with a mix of tense action scenes and emotional connections with Ray and his son. Freeman and Cusack take the film to the next level. If you like either of these actors, get this Steelbook. It looks awesome!"
4,Good action movie!,"John Cusack and Morgan Freeman gives great entertainment in this drama/thriller. I like the twist this movie takes when a rude killer (Freeman) shows sympathy and create a bond with a father (Cusack) and his son (new actor Jamie Anderson). Unrealistic maybe, but somewhat believable after everything they go through all through the movie.I enjoyed this movie, it has great special effects and the scenery is outstanding!"
3,NO EXIT STRAGEDY,"Major Frank Carden (Morgan Freeman) is the leader of a group of well paid hitmen. His job takes his to Washington state. Through a series of events, his trip is interrupted and rescue attempt is botched.Ray Keene (John Cusack) is going camping with his son (Jamie Anderson) for a much needed bonding trip. Playing the good Samaritan, Ray gets caught in the middle of the events, finding himself on the run with a handcuffed Morgan being followed by heavily armed bad guys who are being tracked by the good guys...but the bad guys have never seen a John Cusack film and don't know what a school teacher, wanting to bond with his son, is capable of doing.The acting was good, even if the plot was weak. The film has a twist, but nothing to write home about. Might work for an action flick rental. Not on my keeper shelf.Parental Guide: Couple of rare F-bombs, no sex, rear nudity (Megan ""cute tush"" Dodds)"
3,Disappointing.,I was surprised that two such great actors took on a movie that proved to be boring and very predictable. I was very disappointed. I can see why the price was so good.
2,Flaccid and pointless,"A waste of a four-star cast - total lethargy from beginning to end. The script is uninspired, the acting is so-so (clearly, there was no enthusiasm for this project), the plot meanders, and an almost random choice of sub-plot promises little...and then delivers even less. Every component of this film is lacking, right down to the frequent humorless exchanges inserted presumably by some quack of a script doctor. We didn't even get to see the right wing extremist offed at the end. That, at least, would have perked me up after this positive yawn of a movie."
3,Not bad if you don't have something better to do.,"Actually the acting by Freeman and Cusack isn't bad at all in this action thriller that goes way beyond believability. An ex-cop/High school gym teaching baseball coach out for a reconnecting morning hike with his errant teenaged son, turns into a crazy game of cat and mouse with a team of professional assassins.If you want a moving drama, this probably isn't it, but if you want a fun popcorn movie to take a thinking break with, then ""The Contract"" isn't too bad of a choice.3 *"
3,I was expecting more...,This movie kind of left me saddened because it didn't have a lot to offer. It was in the forest for almost the whole movie and the scenes like on the rock climbing in the rain was soooooo fake. Good movie in the end I guess. I liked the thriller and twist in it.
4,Entertaining Action Flick,"I thought this was a very good action film. Reminded me of CLIFFHANGER or DIEHARD in the woods. It had what I want out of an action movie-clever lines, quirky characters, plucky hero, interesting bad guys and good action scenes. I don't mind formula if it is done well and this was. I thought some of the plot twists were interesting. My wife even liked it. Not sure what the negative reviewers were looking for. I thought it was a very entertaining film."
3,Enjoyable,"Looking at other reviews, tastes clearly differ. The movie had some awkward parts and it's hard to see Cusack as a dad, teacher, and coach, but the movie was fun to watch. Not the best movie in the world, but worth the time."
3,Worth $.99,"I've seen this same story line in several different movies, including old westerns. But, it was worth watching on a Friday night. The story was predictable and a little silly, I never did figure out why a normal guy would endanger his kid to bring a bad guy to justice. However, it was cheap to download and was a lot better than a lot of movies I've rented from blockbusters. Plus you don't have to worry about taking it back and getting charged with a late fee."
3,surprisingly poor movie,"I thought with Freeman, Cusack, and the wilderness as ingredients,this movie had to be a winner. It was just so made-for-TV, B-movie kinda quality. Then there's the bizarre political message involving stem cell research. Three stars is actually probably generous of me."
3,WHAT WENT WRONG?,"Take an acclaimed director (Driving Miss Daisy's BRUCE BERESFORD), an Oscar winning actor (MORGAN FREEMAN), and add the gifted John Cusack, and you think the results should be pretty impressive. But somewhere along the line, the movie misfires and you're left with a well acted, but ultimately disjointed and disappointing movie. Freeman plays a hit man who is ""captured"" by gym teacher Cusack and his troubled son (Jamie Anderson) while on a camping trip. Add a shady government femme fatale (the talented Alice Krige) and some killer conspirator and you get a plot that is never fully realized and unfortunately confusing. Some nice scenery and cinematography too. I just expected more."
4,Intrigue,I won't give away the plot but it has some interesting twists and turns. If you're a Morgan Freeman fan this is not one of his better films.
1,The Contract by Brandon M. Moskos,"I rented this movie because of the main actors in it. Bottom line. this movie SUCKED!!!!!!!!!!! I wouldn't even tell someone to waste their money and rent it. The script, dialogue, and acting all suck. And it is extremely boring. Do not waste your time!"
1,A real stinker,"Just when I thought some movies couldn't get any worse, along came this sorry example of a movie. Why on earth would Morgan Freeman sign up for junk is beyond me. Don't buy. Don't rent it. Don't even borrow it. It's that bad."
1,Worst movie I've seen in a LONG time,With such big actors I thought this movie would be good. However the writing was HORRIBLE and the acting wasn't much different.
2,NOT THE WORST EVER,"I purchased this based on the cummulative reviews and was extremely disappointed. This game quickly becomes tedious and has little re-play value. After playing this game a couple of days, I soon became uninterested. Having said that, it is easy to learn. The the graphics are pretty good and controls easy to master. I also liked the 40's music(although there are just a few songs). This game is not worth the current amazon price. If you found this in a bargain bin for a couple bucks...why not. Don't expect too much."
4,It's a pretty good game.,"I love shooting games and this is a fantastic game. It gives you a lot for the money. Only thing I don't like is that it only support LAN for muti player and too many game levels. Otherwise, it's a pretty good game."
4,Offers more for the money,"I've played many war and military games through the years and I must say I am very impressed with Air Raid. If you don't have time playing Call of Duty or Medal of Honor which are still the great games, you will love this one too. Its simple and sophisticated enough that it will give you the excitment for casual gamer like me."
3,Water and Birds,"This collection of environmental/nature sounds has several good aspects and a few poor ones. This collection contains ten cd's. The good: Mostly relaxing and realistic during each hour of sounds per cd. The bad: Too many quawking and jarring bird sounds during some of the peaceful pieces. The ""thunderstorm"" cd was a major disappointment. It was barely audible. I would also have liked to hear more storm and wind sounds. All in all I give it a six."
3,You get what you pay for...,"I was surprised to find that the book was only 40 pages long. The illustrations are good and the information is presented in a concise and efficient manner. The book covers roughly 8 types of knots and 9 different suturing methods. So obviously it is ideal for someone looking to get a quick hands-on start on basic suturing.[update 4-5-07] I think I may have underestimated this book. It is actually a nice and concise primer that I have referenced again and again. It is small enough to fit in a white coat or lab jacket pocket. Here is a summarized Table of Contents: One and two-handed square knot, Instrument tie square knot, Miller's and Modified Miller's knot; Suture materials, needles, methods, and patterns(appositional, tension, and inverting); Removing sutures and Basic Sterile Technique."
3,"OK, not very good",The book is OK but the illustrations could be better. The instructions sometimes continue onto the next page which can be a bit frustrating. The book also came to me with a torn cover. It is not the best for basic instruction.
2,Surgical Knots and suturing review,Book was not instructional at all - better to learn from a suture company or a surgeon that will just take the time to show you the way to throw knots etc. There are way better books out there on the market.
3,Wonderful suggestions but horrible editing,"This book is filled with wonderful ideas for early childhood educators all the way through 1st grade teachers. I am now a kindergarten teacher and will be using the suggested strategies in my own classroom this coming fall. My only complaint, and the reason that I rated it a 3 is because the editing is horrible. I do not mean only one or two typos, I mean one or two per page. It took me longer to get through this text than it should have because I was so distracted by the constant errors. As this is their 2nd edition, they should have hammered out the kinks by now. Sadly, if I were a college professor teaching a course on the project approach, I would not use this book solely because of its mechanical errors. Ladies, if you need a new editor, please call me! Prior to teaching, editing was my passion."
5,good quality,"Very high quality.Tape color is the same as the skin.It's so inconspicuous.This tape is resistant to skin oil,Continue the strong adhesive force."
5,The inextinguishable Prokoviev mood!,"The set of Prokoviev's piano concertos has not been better performed as a whole. With the notable exception of the most popular of all of them - the third one - has without hesitation better options (Samson Francois, William Kapell's two performances and a fabulous version of Gary Graffman) . But John Browning achieved a very praised pinnacle in his artistic career with these exciting and unsurpassed interpretations. At least I don't know about other second and fourth Piano Concerto better played. The First has s serious contender in Richter and the Fifth in Richter and Ashkenazy, but the distinguished refinement, sumptuous pianism and depurated interpretive style of Browning one of the remarkable pianist of his generation, makes of this album a true must-have.I don't have any doubt John Browning will always be reminded basically for this mesmerizing set in the recent and future. Leinsdorf is remarkable too at the front of the Boston Symphony."
4,"A good, but not great, military atlas","Covers Napoleon's campaigns many at the operational and strategic level. The color registration is off slightly on some maps (the overprinting is a little visible).As other reviewers have noted, a history/description is needed in order to understand the maps and why the various arrows went where they did.Naval operations and operations outside of Europe are touched on, but the focus is on Europe."
5,iio at the end and iio rapture,i think both iio at the end and rapture are cool my dad likesboth of these tracks too and i am trying to get him some iio cds for his birthday
1,Cologne was old.,"The perfume that I received was old. The scent was not good at all. When I contacted the ones who sent it to me, I was told that I would be called back to be told when and where to return the merchandise, but I never heard from anyone. I was truly disapointed!!!! I never got my money back."
4,A great monitor... so why can't I find a new one?,"I bought this little beauty two years ago. It was great! The picture was sharp and crisp, and the colours were stunning. The X-Brite technology lived up to expectations. I loved it.Unfortunately, it died yesterday. Though it is still under warranty, I need a replacement ASAP. Sony does not appear to be making monitors anymore. Why? If the product was so good, why discontinue it?The monitor itself is 5 stars. I took off a star because it died, and because I can't get a new one."
5,Just the right part,Replaced a broken one with this part - my cabinet now opens and closes perfectly!
2,scary face,im ten and i like thr rescue heroes but his face made me scared so i dont like this rescue hero but i like his vehicle
1,"Simply awful. Insulting to women, men, and anyone with any sense of decency.","Reading this book makes me sick to the stomach. The ""comics"" don't make any sense at all, while still somehow managing to offend anyone who reads it. The book makes women seem vapid and shallow while insulting anyone who doesn't fit the authors ideas as to what a woman or man should be. Also, the positive reviews were clearly written by Donna Barstow herself, as she admitted to on her twitter account."
2,Inaccurate Lousiana Flag,"Flag is not the ""official version"" as it says it is. Has no wounds on the mother pelicans chest. Shipping was fast though."
1,Not a high quality paperback,"While I am not in a position to judge the quality of the translation, this volume is not a ""High Quality Paperback"", as the cover proclaims. It is a typewritten publication. The translation doesn't synch with the original but follows. Not worth the money."
4,A must have reference work,"If you have even an ancillary interest in the American Civil War, this is essential to read and to own. I consult my copy on a weekly basis and I've owned it for twenty years. Warner writes well and succinctly about all of the Confederate Generals. Each biography is accompanied by a single photograph of the subject. The book is like a large biographical dictionary, easy to navigate and peruse at your leisure. If you are interested in in-depth material on any of these Generals, it's best to consult an individual biography of your chosen favorite. But if you have a casual interest or merely want an essential reference tool, this is a ""must have.""Many historians have compiled lists of the most influential and indispensable civil war books of the 20th century. Invariably, Warner's book is included, along with the companion volume on Union Generals. It's not fancy, but it remains one of the preeminent biographical tools for any civil war historian."
1,Not for small teeth,"I thought I had fairly large front teeth, but this cap was much larger and would not stay on. Maybe I'll try some bonding cement and see if that will hold it on."
4,Stokowski In His Element,"While I am not partial to Wagner or Liszt, the glory of these performances is found in the compositions of Enescu and Smetana. Often dismissed because of his theatricality, here Stokowski shines with brilliance in music so suited to his flamboyant, some would say gushy, nature. The Moldau flows beautifully along its varied course under this capable baton, filled with the vitality of a first-time hearing of this familiar but wonderful standard. Not so well known to all is the Enescu Roumanian Rhapsody. Stokowski imbues such diverse coloration and rhythmic insistance as to mesmerise on each listening. More than an historical document, these recordings could well become your favorite performances of these works. Though recorded before the age of DDD digital techniques, the sound is brilliant, realistic and energizing. Available in both hybrid SACD and standard CD formats. Most highly recommended."
2,whoa - this is bad......,"This is one of the worst CD's I have ever purchased. The sound quality is awful and is not peaceful and soothing, in any way.Monotonous, dull, boring, repetitive."
5,Telescope Tripod,The tripod worked very well with the telescope I had purchased. The problem was that most tripods are rather flimsy. I needed a heavy duty tripod for the Celestron scope because it is very heavy. It worked well.
3,"Pretty good, with one big problem","It arrived in good shape, on time. It works fairly well with a Celestron C5, with one major problem. The elevation fine adjust has a huge amount of play, several degrees. The big adjustment screw has a preload or at least an end play adjustment, but the real problem comes from the nut in the middle of this screw. It can move around. The tiny phillips head screw that holds this part in place doesn't do much and eventually worked itself loose again. It may be missing a part, the tripod arrived with no instructions or drawings of any kind. The azimuth fine adjust did not have this problem."
2,Where's the user manual?,I agree with the two previous reviewers. There needs to be a user manual and there isn't one. The fine adjustment will adjust the vertical angle maybe 15 degrees. This isn't very helpful for star gazing. The maximum height of the tripod is only 45 inches. This is an uncomfortable height for looking through binoculars while standing. Celestron should have a users guide showing how their tripod and binoculars are supposed to work together.
2,Wish I shopped around before buying,"I'm not satisfied with this prduct. I bought it on trusting the Celestron product team. I wanted it to work well with the SkyMaster 25x100 bino. The parts and construction of the tripod have too many cheap metal and cheap plastic parts for cost of the product. I question how reliable and long lasting the core worm drives will be. As noted by other buyers the legs are too short and there seems to be no easy way to get around this with a table, etc. I now wonder if Amazon would buy it back? Also how will I find a suitable triod with having to buy it first? Amazon sold this to me for $99, now less than one month later the price is $35. $35 is more appropriate but possibly not worth the annoyances."
2,Tripod,"I have been very disappointed with this product. The overall height is wrong for any situation I can find to use it. I bought it to use with astronomy binoculars. It is too short to use standing and too tall to use sitting, at least for me. (I'm 5'9""). It is solid enough to not shake much and the fine adjustment works well. I would shop around before buying this one. If there were a height adjustment, it would be much better."
5,Nice Heavy Tripod.,"I'm sure this is not for everyone. I bought it to use with a 1250 mm telephoto lens. Was too heavy for stability with a standard camera type tripod. This fills the bill for me just fine.Pro's: Very stable. Love the cable operated adjustments for vertical-horizontal fine adjustments. The mount has adequate strength and length to support long (but narrow) attachments.Con's: It's a bit long (folded) for travel. In spite of that however, it's not really tall enough for ""normal"" camera use. Only height adjustment is extending or retracting legs. Pan has a knob to allows the head to turn easily. Height does not. Strictly friction and pretty tight.That said, I only included the Con's for information to those who would buy it for conventional camera usage. Nothing I listed in the con's (except maybe the overall height of 45""), really has any effect on my use.Overall, if you need a good stable platform at a reasonable price, this should work for you."
2,Heavy & useless,"I hate this tripod , it is heavy and not stable at all.I think it needs to be tightend.It has very nice controls vertical and hirzontal"
4,Instruction Booklet ?????,"I received my order of the Celestron Heavy-Duty Altazimuth Tripod today. I ordered this tripod as a base for my new Celestron C90mm Spotting Scope. I must say the the tripod is very sturdy in appearance and looks as though it will easily support the C90. However, there is one glaring omission in the package that I received..... there are absolutely no instructions on how to assemble the various parts of this tripod, or, instructions on how the tripod works. Perhaps this is a one-shot mistake in packaging this item, but if I were Amazon I would make sure instructions are included in this item. Also, I would notify Celestron to include instructions. I plan to contact both Amazon and Celestron about this omission.Sincerely, Nautical Art"
1,Was delivered broken with zero instruction..,"Purchased this item a month ago with the Amazon delivery being spot on as usual.Product overall is of reasonable quality for the price however even though it was wrapped in bubble wrap, one of the plastic screws which adjust the legs had snapped clean off. Have since glued it as I couldn't be bothered calling them up for a replacement.Most reviews of this product were ""very"" average and I should have listened. Next time I will.."
1,neck breaker,too small.Very limited to go up or down.you can't use it to look at the sky above your head.I strongly DO NOT recommend it if used to look at the stars ! One good point : strong !
4,Heavy-Duty Tripod for begginers,"Advantages:- cheap- heavy-duty- alt/azimuth fine tune flexible knobsDisadvantages:- altitude fast tuning not usable. Only fine tune available with knob. But its very slow and have limited range. To setup altitude angle you have to use big wrench. Thats very strange feature for that price. I was very disappointed with that. That makes it not 5 star product.- its not mobile. You have to move to your spot 4 separate parts, its heavy, and its big in collapsed state.- its not high enough to use it in standing position. I use chair )- its mostly made from metal but some plastic parts in fine altitude mechanism make it a bit slow in feedback. That is very strange too. But not too critical while not broken )Maybe sometime I will raplace its head. The base is still worth the money."
5,Almost Forgotten Classic!,"That people don't know this album is a shame. Alan is such a great talent. There are at least three songs on here that blow me away. ""I Wanna Dance"" is one of the most infectious rock songs ever! You will be singing it in your head forever...Try it!"
4,Good value for a good product,"I really like this table. It took a few days to get in the habit of using it...but once I started it was hard to stop. It became a 5-minute block of personal time 3 times a day to relax. This worked wonders for many years of abuse I put my back through.This would be a 5 start product if it folded up completely to store easily when not in use.Overall, I would recommend to a friend or family member."
3,Shipping Problems With This Item,"The product is fine, but anyone thinking of ordering it should be aware that the ""delivery"" service from Amazon, at least with the super saver shipping, might require you to pick it up yourself. Mine was shipped by Airborne, who handed it off to USPS, who refused to deliver it because it was too heavy. I'm glad I picked the free shipping because I had to go pick it up from the post office myself anyway. I would have been better off purchasing it from a local store since it would have been faster, so you might want to consider that option."
4,ASF has survived !,"I was a bit worried about this new album as the last years wedidn't hear very much about ASF. It was only ""Best of"" or""b-side versions"", ""remixed"" same old songs. But what a pleasure when you start to play the CD ! A deep wave gets inside your body and you just get another trip to the moon. It's not Techno. It's not Punk. It's not the average gothic music. It's something special : ALIEN SEX FIEND Spirit ! It could have been more dynamic and funny like before but it is a good one ! They were dead and re-buried but they are re-borned again."
5,Alien Sex Fiend cd,I received the CD very quickly and it was in wonderful condition. I will definitely order from this seller again. :)
3,hand me down blues,"My family has a history of depression and I am now pregnant so I was looking for a book to help me prevent it from passing to my child. This book was not as helpful as I had hoped. The majority of it seemed to be trying to convince the reader why family aspects are important to this disorder. I already agreed with most of what he was saying there so I felt it was a little bit of a waste of time. The second to last chapter actually gave some direct tips and advice which is what I wanted. The last chapter just seemed to promote family therapy. I'm sure there are more books out there that could offer more advice than this one does, but it is a decent start."
2,Poor editing makes for a frustrating read,"I have to agree with the other reviewers- there are lots of typos in the book that an experienced IT person looking for a review could probably puzzle out but a newbie would be misled and frustrated by. What I'll add to the discussion is that I contacted the publisher about the availability of an errata sheet. Their response is that there isn't any. Sloppy editing is bad enough but not to even bother to create an errata sheet for a book published back in 2004 is inexcusable. This reflects very poorly on the publisher and I for one, will think twice before buying anything else in the ""demystified"" series."
2,"Poorly Edited, Lousy Information Design","I haven't finished the book yet - in fact, I'm just two chapters in, but the sloppy editing and information design has already irritated me enough to warn others off. The frequent diagrams often don't match the text that explains them, and even when they do, they're garbled to the point of being too confusing to use. The topic of data structures is a complex one, and I only partially fault the book's confusing language (things along the lines of ""a pointer to a pointer is a variable that points to the contents of another pointer variable""), but the slapdash diagram design is inexcusable. When I have to stop thinking about the example the diagram is meant to describe just to figure out what the diagram *should* look like, the diagram has failed."
1,Data Structures made Mystified by a rush job,"I've just read through the first two chapters. None of the topics addressed are brand new to me, but the book has almost takes away the understanding I had before.The book was certainly rushed through with no copy editing, as a prior reviewer has already mentioned. The typos are annoying but largely don't get in the way of understanding the author's intent. However, when he mixes up an important term with another, it makes me needlessly question my whether I have a grasp of concept.I can't trust what I'm reading in this book. It's unfortunate that it's assigned reading for me."
3,Not my favorite,"There are better stories out there about front line soldiers during the War Between the States. I bought this one simply because I am originally from Gwinnett County, Georgia and was interested in what I might learn. Landers' story is interesting but the way it was presented in this book was lacking something in my opinion. Maybe the author did the best she could, but I was somewhat disappointed."
5,great abstract DVD,"Fast delivery and DVD was in great condition, very much enjoyed viewing it as well as learned a lot."
1,Disappointed,Not sure why anyone would rate this anything above a 1 star. It has elementary school age information. I fast forwarded it after a few minutes to see if it went past such simple stuff but it did not. If I had paid $6.99 instead of $29 for it I would'nt be so hard on it. Its a waste of money.
1,disappointing,"Such a waste of time and money. I should have heeded the warnings of the previous reviewers who said they had to fast forward this dvd. Anytime there is a need to fast forward a dvd, that should have been a clue for me. The title is misleading. This dvd should be called how to put a mark on paper 101. Or how fast can you fast forward on your dvd. He starts out showing you how to make lines on paper with various medium. Then with sumi brushes he dips the brushes in the ink and throws the ink on the paper. Then for the duration of the dvd you watch him draw more lines on paper. I fast forwarded several times throughout this dvd. Don't waste your time or money. I didn't find any inspiration in this dvd."
3,Really different,Not the thing I was looking for. I do not know if it is just me or not but I am dislexicwhich really has a lot to do with it too I think. Anyways. I was in the market for artinstruction since I also have two kids. I want to know how to paint flowers but this isabout something way different although it looks like fun.
4,Yet another book,Book arrived in a timely manner. Book had the information I was interested in. A standard Osprey book with good overall information and artwork that is fine.
2,Time to Retire This Work,"THis is typical of the past emphasis by Osprey upon serving the model making and military miniature crowd. The original purpose has faded as the publisher produces more and more volumes covering shorter periods of time with more emphasis on munitions and order of battle, plus new series on specific campaigns and volumes covering fortifications and trench warfare.The recent publication of a group of individual studies: two on the German Army on the Western Front, one on the Eastern Front,plus those on Germany's allies, those on aviation (which I do not study), s detailed study of the Sturmtruppen of 1917-18, and many others covering aspects of WWI German military affairs, have put paid to the uselfulness of this volume.This is just too broad brush to be useful anymore even tothe merely curious."
4,Highly Recommended,"This is quite a useful early-intermediate collection with some advances in vocabulary and verb tenses beyond the ordinary beginner's course.One of the best features is that English is on one channel and Spanish is on the other. In other words if you like ""immersion"" then you can hear all-Spanish with no English.On the CD set the voices are clear and the sound quality is excellent. Timing of the phrases is adequate. Repetition of language items is adequate.Very happily there is no extraneous music other than chimes to mark sections. Chimes are not too frequent. You can play your own music if you like.Minus a half star for the booklet which is tiny, odd-sized, and printed in somewhat small type. But it does contain the transcript. Helpfully, important language items are underlined. There is no index."
1,A total waste on my time and money,"I've never listened to any language courses as boring as this one. There's no stucture in the entire course. It's just simply read one word or one sentence in English and repeat it twice in Spanish. That's it. All those words and sentences are not related to each other so you can hardly make any connetion, thus learn anything from it.I really hate this course."
3,Another damned good CD,"The Damned deliver the goods with their best CD since Machine Gun Etiquette. Yes, the rumors of this being a good CD are true. ""song.com"", ""W"", ""Beauty of the Beast"", ""Looking For Action"", ""Neverland"" & ""Democracy?"" are all great songs. The CD also has great production, playing, and songwriting. The line up of Vanian, Captin, Patricia, Monty, & Pinch really show all of their strengths and none of their weaknesses. The only things that I can find negatively about the album is that maybe the production is a little bit too good(I'm more used to the earlier punk production) and that some songs stay for longer than they should, but that would be nit-picking wouldn't it. The CD is deffinately a step in the right direction and is a great album from the Damned. Its a must for any Damned fan who like the Stawberries CD which it actually reminds me of and improves upon."
5,The Damned... damn!,"Hey, do you like music? If you do, get this. I'll be DAMNED if you don't like it. It's that DAMNED good. Hopefully this mysticism will be enough for you to check out ""Grave Disorder."""
4,Re-animation,"Around the time of the 'Black Allbum' and 'Strawberries' it appeared as if the Damned were going to graduate from being a mobile drunken riot (which was a lot of fun) into a serious and talented band. Poised on the brink of acclaim the Damned lost Captain Sensible and opted for cute gothic and artistic oblivion. In the meantime we all grew up and got jobs and put away childish things until one day...Grave Disorder appears. Sensible is back, politics looks scary, dance music is over - it is 1982 all over again. A lone horseman of the apocalypse has returned, a little beat-up. Whatever next."
5,Best Damned album since Strawberries.,"Grave Disorder is the first Damned album since 1995 ""I'm All Right Jack"" and the first one with David Vanian and Captain Sensible working on new studio material since the 12 inch platter ""Thanks for the Night"". The two are the lastof the original members still working under the Damned banner. The new members Pinch (drums) Monty the (Oxy)Moron (synths and keyboards) and Patricia Morrison (bass and vocals) work together fine as a cohesive unit. All the material is new (except Neverland, it debut on Captain Sensible's Mad Cows and Englishmen independent record disc).The Damned has never sounded better. David Vanian seems to be enjoying himself (check out I'm All Right Jack..)and the good Captain's guitar work has never sounded better. Not an over produced nightmare like their last studio disc. A great album, I can't wait until they get back into the studio! The CD comes with a fold out that has glossy photos and a lyric sheet.Highly recommended."
2,AVOID the DIGIVIEW ENTERTAINMENT transfer,"This DIGIVIEW transfer of ""OUT OF THE BLUE"" DVD is bundled with ""MOBWAR"" on the same disc. I've just watched ""OUT OF THE BLUE"" and it's an attrocious transfer. Overall, it looks like it was coppied from a well worn and damaged VHS tape. It looks bleached-out and the sound is generally muffled. Some scenes have video noise that looks like an old silent movie.Although the back of the thin case says ""NR"" not rated, all the ""F"" words are silenced, as well as some other words. The case also says it's 68 minutes long, but my DVD counter says it's 84.30, and that includes credits, which still leaves about 9 minutes missing compared with other reviewer's transfers. Some of the scenes that other reviewers speak of, I didn't see.Need I go on? Based on other reviewer's comments, I'm going to try to find an ANCHOR BAY transfer because the acting seems exceptional, especially that of Sharon Farrell and Linda Manz."
1,worse than falling off a horse,"I bought this game and the playstation with my own money. It's a good game, but once you win it, it's horrible! the only hard part is the firefly game. Even my pro cousin can't beat it. I traded it in for the Emperors New Groove game and was GLAD it was gone. Loading was horrible, too. I'd rather have a real horse or fall off my friends horse. Get marykateandashley's winners circle instead."
2,What about the girls!,"This game is somewhat of a dissapointment. We purchased it for our 6 yr old daughter in the hope that she could log some more time on the PSX. The problem is, she got bored with it right away (2 days!). You really can't do much with this game. She has mastered the point and click activities and easly moves the horse around (or as much as the program allows, which is very little). The only thing that saves the game is that it is Barbie, and my daughter loves Barbie.When are they going to write some good software for young girls!"
2,not helpful,"This book provided very few constructive ideas, and the ones that were given seemed obvious even to me, a novice LDRer. I also found it offensive that the book contained websites to get further info, which then encouraged you to buy more books by Ms. Karsner instead of giving new advice. Also, although the book is seemingly 124 pages long, the last 30 pages are for ""Romanspirations"" that you are meant to fill in yourself. I read the entire thing in 30 minutes. Overall, I didn't find this book helpful, and would not recommend it to anyone who is seriously looking for suggestions to improve their LDR."
4,www.longdistancerelationships.com,"As someone with a lot of expereince in this field, both personal and professional, trust me when I say this book is outstanding. Love in a relationship goes a long way. But love is constantly ""motivated"" by the sheer constant presence of a loved one. From the research I did prior to developing a website devoted to lifes longdistancerelationships. the basic problem with LDRs is that the distance removes the constant ""in your face"" motivation that geographically close relationships have. So it takes extra effort. Anything that can be done to minimize that effort and allows the couples to easily interact is what aids in maintaining a successful LDR. This book provides excellent ideas in an easy to read format. Albeit some ideas are almost cheesy and some feel foolish but remember, in the name of love almost any behavior can be justified. So again I highly recomend this book and if you have any comments, feel free to email me at longdistancerelationships.comDr. Ashish"
5,Nice,"This book contains very simple and necessary knowledge about dogs, if you purchase this book, you'll love it."
1,Junk,I set this tent up and with in two days the poles bent and the roof started to rip. It is a total waste of money.After this happened I call the company and they would do nothing for me they just wanted me to buy replacement parts from them.Don't buy it
1,Hm...Roosters?,"I have a couple of tracks from this company...some good, some not so good. I wouldn't recommend this one. There is a large section of it that has a sort of hollow feedback that's quite distracting, but the most jarring thing for me is this...what on earth are roosters doing crowing in 'the Deep Woods?'"
3,Drum mics prone to feedback,I purchased these because of the price. They sound ok. The snare/tom mics are prone to feedback in a live situation.
5,The last garlic press you'll ever buy,"I bought mine about 6 years ago. It is extremely durable. Two solid pieces of metal connected by a durable hinge. The plastic handles are removable to allow for ease of cleaning.There is space for one large clove, or two smaller ones.A bit of force is necessary to force the garlic through this press.Fun to use!!"
4,Nice camera,"I am using this camera for 1 month, I have to say that it is bigger and heavier than it seems on the pictures. But when I use and learn more about, I definitely like it. You have full control on every setting with really impressive video recording quality. Good battery life and user friendly menus. The only defect I found is, if you zoom during recording a video, the sound fades away. One of my friend has NV10, and its same. I think this is related with the software of Samsung camera. Whatever, you got a nice camera for a good price."
3,Decent Product,"The camera features and operation are great. The problem is that the lens sticks out from the body, so ""slipping"" it into your pocket is not an option. Besides the bulky shape, its a great camera."
1,Looking for the warranty,"Well, it took 3 weeks to receive because UPS lost it. Worked for about 4 days until it wouldn't turn on (the lense is stuck in the extended position) and started making a weird beeping noise. Before that, I had trouble getting it to set to the auto mode but that seemed to go away. The pictures weren't all that great but manually adjusting the aperture and shutter speed helped. This is not a very good point and shoot camera. In short, I would save the money this thing costs and buy something more expensive, which is what I am going to have to do anyway.The good news is that the vendor, PC Universe, was very helpful in getting the product found and delivered to me. They actually answered their phones right away the several times I called them."
4,Samsung S850 is good but its a battery hog.,"Over 1 year later it still works fine, even after a 4ft drop to asphalt.Its fun with a lot of features you will most likely never use. Frame your pics with several premade frames. Record audio to go with your pics. Nice fades during the slideshow. It seems to have all the usual film settings for a mid grade camera, I leave it on auto 95% of the time. Plenty of resolution to heavy crop most any pic and still be sharp. I usually end up making some gentle brightness/contrast changes in editing.Drains NiMh batteries so fast. Keep at least 1 set of spares at all times. Won't even work with some older NiMh. Won't work for long at all with any standard alkaline, somuch that its a complete waste to use them. Never tried the Lithium.Poor battery life is not a factor in picture quality thankfully, so overall I'm happy with the performance and features of this camera."
2,You get what you pay for,I always had Cannon cameras and they worked great but broke easily and the customer service was horrible. I bought this camera at sears yesterday and it is back at sears today. I asked the customer sevice person why the camera was only listed at $123 and he said that he didn't know because he heard that it is a great camera. After using it for 10 minutes I could tell that the quality was bad. I bought the camera for the 8.1 MP however it didn't seem to be any better then the ratio on my cannon which was 3.2. A friend told me that the MP doesn't matter if the lense is bad. After using the camera for about 25 minutes the batteries died.I only recomend this camera if you want something cheap that takes ok pictures during the day
2,Don't Like It,"I have had this camera for a couple of months, and am looking to replace it. My chief complaint is the lag time in between pictures. It takes FOREVER to shoot multiple shots, and you can forget about getting a pic of a sporting event. There also isn't a view finder, so all shots must be taken from the screen.I've only used one or 2 of the features. I do like the video capability. However, this camera is NOT user friendly, and needs a lot of study.The size is one of the reasons that I bought it - nice and small - fits easily into a purse. However, the slow speed just don't make this camera practical."
2,its just ok...,"I bought this camera in March. While it isnt a full blown bad camera, it isnt a real good one either. It takes beautiful pictures, as long as you dont put a zoom in. As soon as you start in with the zoom it starts to blur and gives you the little notice that you are shaking. It does this even on the tripod. It also does not work well if your subject is moving... At all...if anything moves before the camera decides to go from ""capturing"" to ""Processing"" your picture is gone. I would say its a good camera for someone just learning to take pictures and not wanting a lot of close ups, on the move type, or wild life pictures. Since the majority of my pictures are wildlife, close ups, scenic, and moving and I usually need to get them taken fast, this camera isnt working for me. I have just today 6 months later purchased a different camera. Like I said, it does take beautiful pictures...when you can actually get the shot you intended."
1,Camera review,This is supposed to be a good camera but I have had very little success with this camera. The seller sent me a defective product.
1,"strained analogies, imprecise definitions, verbose","This book was not at all helpful for me in understanding what objects, classes and processes might actually be. The analogies about cookies and cookie cutters are not explained with enough precision to provide understanding. The definitions of objects, classes and processes are not filled out with actual examples that exactly state what is an object in a block of code, why it is an object and not something else, and what is not an object in a block of code. The writing seems to ramble on without imparting meaning, and I am left guessing. The author apparently does not understand that the reader of such a basic, introductory book should be assumed to have never been a user of any progam language whatsoever."
2,Its ok...,"The first two chapters were pretty clear and well written. But starting at chapter 3, everything seems to be unclear to me. I'm more mystified about OOP than before! But I'm still reading the book and hopefully the rest of it may be more clear."
2,This book does not live up to its title,"As a Bowie fan, I know quite a few stories behind Bowie songs. Unfortunately, this book tells very few of them. The title is a misnomer for what is actually another annotated discography to rival with Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray's ""David Bowie, An Illustrated Record"" (which, having been published in 1981, covers exactly the same period) and David Buckley's ""The Complete Guide To The Music of David Bowie"". Also, why did the writer choose to draw the line in 1980? As much as I agree this is the most important period of David's output, twenty years have gone by which shouldn't have been ignored. By the way, what the author describes as ""intake of breath"" at the beginning of ""The Bewlay Brothers"" has always sounded like David smoking a joint to me!"
1,Chris Welch...Super-Creep,"David Bowie is a largely mysterious subject to begin with. That being, an author can be given some semblace of room in narrowing down on such a difficult subject. However, the hatchet job Mr.Welch perpetrated on Bowie is an obvious offense to Bowie fans and literate society in general. With a wealth of misinformation and glaring oversights, it would be a misnomer to call this book anything approaching a biography...it is a work of fiction, and a very poor one at that. This book is going straight to the bargain bins."
1,Skip IT!,"Go to the Complete David Bowie by Pegg if you want to know more about the music. I couldn't even finish this piece of opinionated (and not terribly accurate)rubbish. I'm a Bowie fan of 34 years and I've read most of the books out there, seen him in concert 7 times and own his whole catalog. Trust me on this one.The Complete David Bowie"
1,WORST BOOK EVER WRITTEN,"Nothing more to say. Braindead author dribbles lame incoherent excrement across pages of library photos. Shoot him please so his sad rock laments are stopped now. Contradicts himself within same paragraph, tells lies, clutches at straws. Made me really really angry. Burn in hell fool."
3,Fram fuel filter,"I ordered this for a 94 Corvette...it will not fit a 94 Vette...luckily, I traded it for the right filter in an auto parts section of a large chain."
2,Best of Bluegrass Underground,The title of this video suggested Bluegrass music but there was far too much other type of music in it.I was very disapointed in it.I would not recommend it for anyone who might purchase it for Bluegrass music.
1,Save your money.,"Not what I consider true bluegrass. Difficult to sit through. Some might like. It, but i would not buy this again."
2,What a disappointment,Ricky Skaggs was the only true Bluegrass on the whole dvd and the 2 songs he did were at the very end. A waste of money and time.
2,Not Worth It,"This book and books like it should simply be retitled by the editor as ""A Waste of Paper"". Honestly, it's ill-researched, with opinions presented as facts and no footnotes. I am dismayed that this is regarded as a scholarly work. I support people who think for themselves, but opinion can only be taken seriously insofar as it is seriously presented. An excellent resource for an example of wishful thinking and poor research."
2,Better of writing what she knows,"Moura does a good job of invalidating at least 3 religions in this book. Especially ceremonialism/Kabbalah. She creates ""problems"" for them on account of her ""historical research"" that she doesn't even bother to recognize in the text. What makes this book even less believable are the sporadic and distracting meditation spells. These are completely irrelevant to the topics she discusses. Moura should know that when writing about the histories of many religions (not just witchcraft-which I also don't believe IS a religion), you can't offer opinions on them (or degrade them, in this special case). You can tell she is not at all fond of Christians, ceremonialists, and Jews (as a warning), but Moura treats Wicca as though it were the ""correct"" way. Maybe this is because she knows many Wiccans will read this book. The 2 stars are for the few places where the author has some actual information that is presented with facts and references."
1,Down the primrose path again,"Here we have a half-baked idea served over a bed of ruse, and covered with a nice bamboozle sauce. The book would be laughable if not for the fact that some people will probably think it has merit. This will only serve to further confuse and mislead people, contributing to the abundance of misinformation so prevalent in books by Llewellyn. Regretfully, Moura's book only fosters a lack of credibility for authors that write on the topic of modern witchcraft. In this respect it harms the Craft community at large."
3,So here's the question...,"... how much do we really know about out past? Moreover, how much of it can we prove?Ann Moura gives an alternative view about where Witchcraft came from and why. Most of us cling to the idea that Witchcraft is based on something that goes back before Gerald Gardener, back before the rise of Christianity, and back before the start of recorded history. I would reccommend this book to anyone who already has a strong background in the history of the craft and who is interested in a slightly different perspective.It is very dense reading, jam-packed with facts. My advice to any reader is to approach this book with an open, but objective, mind. Who knows? Maybe one day we can trace the history back to the stone age... but until more evidence arises, the ideas in this book present themselves as the offspring of mere wishful thinking."
1,Very weak book,"When I first saw this title, I was intrigued. When I read the book, I was dismayed.Moura's ""Origins"" is one of the worst books I have ever read on this subject. It is poorly organised. The author's historical theory is weakly, if ever, supported by factual evidence (the author indicates in the preface that her readers might find such things dreary). She ignores recent scholarship in her ""bibliography,"" listing almost nothing published within the last decade, which has been rich in Neolithic research. Perhaps the most disturbing aspect is the religiously inflamatory pseudo-historiographical ranting, often presented in the first person and interspersed within the chapters at irregular intervals.Frankly, as both a Wiccan priestess and a historian, I would encourage readers to leave this one alone.This is a must-to-avoid book."
3,A little hard to take at times,"Ann Moura tends to bash too much in this work for my taste. Not only does she bash many Judeo-Christian beliefs, but she bashes other traditions of Witchcraft other than her own Green Witch tradition. The theories, however, of how religions are entertwined, that belief systems can usually be traced to related origins are very interesting and intriguing. I think I've learned more about ancient civilizations (on the surface) than I did in HS history class.The first two chapters are a complete bear to get through. If you can make it past that, you'll be OK. Very heavy in the dates and ancient geography that you've probably forgotten."
5,a must-have for HH fans,howard's voice is as brilliant as ever -- clear and strong. the musical arrangements are plush and rich like the songs of old (none of that sampling here). and his songs will set the tone for love on any romantic night. it's a must-have for dedicated fans and newcomers.
5,soulful,"I always support anything Ralph Johnson of EARTH WIND & FIRE DOES. so when I heard on the ewf website that he was producing Howard Hewitt Cd, I of course bought it.I knew I wasn't going to be dissapointed. I knew of Howard Hewitt from the shalamar days but never heard any solo work. I was so surprise he has such a soulful voice. This cd touches every aspect of love highs and lows. It even has a very touching gospel song, OUR FATHER,and a great version of JOHN LENNON, IMAGINE.I must say that Im now a Howard Hewitt fan for life.Great work, u will enjoy every song, I promise.JUDELA"
3,disappointing,"Howard Hewett has a wonderful voice and style and it shows once again. But the material is very weak, almost only slowtempo tracks, quite similar to each other, and lyrics without much meaning. Why doesn't a mature man like Hewett sing realistically about mature relationships but instead of ""girls"", ""babies"" or ""babes""...Will sell this CD as soon as possible."
1,What?!?,"Listing: ""Coochy Fragrance Free 8 oz. Shave crème.Ingredients: ... fragrance...Question: How the hell is this product Fragrance Free when it contains fragrance?!?"
2,A quick expensive burst of edutainment.,"A lot of Pokemon fans would certainly enjoy learning about math more when there are Pokemon all over the worksheet. That's what you'll get in this 3rd Grade level of Math, but for the money, the book doesn't really last too long. Most children will develop the skills and lose interest towards the end, and after all this is a consumable mathbook that will hit the shelves of Pokemon fans within a few weeks. Although, you can't deny the fact that even teachers may find this pretty educational."
5,Awesome!,"Being a HUGE fan of Remember the Titans, I was anxiously awaiting the release of Remember this Titan -- the Bill Yoast Story. Steve Sullivan did not disappoint and even exceeded all expectations. Sullivan managed to tell Coach Yoast's story in a way that keeps the reader wanting more. What I loved so much about Remember the Titans, I found in Remember this Titan - a chance to experience every emotion possible from laughter and tears to excitement and trepidation. Not only was I left with an intense respect for Coach Yoast, but also for Sullivan as a writer. Coach Yoast's story should be a ""must read"" for every student, leader, religious group, book club and parent. What an amazing example of leadership and character Yoast is and what a remarkable job Sullivan did depicting it."
2,just ok,"for about 4 dollars you cant go wrong. got this to gift a kid, and probably will do that-- but did not like the product."
1,Seriously lacking,"Save your time and money--this is a complete miss and not competitive with any of the other recordings of this woefully-neglected masterpiece. In this performance, Gardiner doesn't suggest he has even a little bit of insight into Bruckner's music. Compared to Jochum's magnificent performance with the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra--which conveys a sense of grandeur, magnificence, and wonder--you'd be hard pressed to find any of those in this recording. The Vienna Philharmonic, who have produced so many memorable Bruckner performances, don't sound like they think a whole lot of Gardiner either."
4,4 and 1/2 stars...BUT,"The track listing for this version on Sony is incorrect. The bonus tracks listed are only on the reissue on Sundazed Records. So tracks 1-11...OK, tracks 12-15...no way.That said, this is one of the best PR&R; albums and the first that featured songs written by the band. If you just want to check them out this is a cheap way to go. Not remastered but if you become a huge fan (you just might) you can always upgrade. Otherwise there is a great ""best of"" on Raven called Kicks. You positively can't go wrong with that one. It features great re-mastering and 30 superboss tracks. Get it on!Kicks! The Anthology 1963-1972"
3,not great for heavy rider,"a lot of the replacement 27in wheels available skimp on something, like spoke count, spoke material, or rim material. these are a nice alloy rim and 36h hub, combined with STAINLESS STEEL SPOKES. SS spokes are far stronger and more desirable than ucp spokes (which is what the similarly prices sta tru wheel comes with). Only dowside to this wheel is the rim is single wall, and it comes still needing the spokes to be stress relieved (look up how to do it). also the hubs were a little tight, but the bearings were nicely greasedupdate: about 4 mos in spokes started breaking. I would not recommend this rim if you are a heavy rider. it is on my brothers bike and he weighs 230. so far 3 broken spokes and once they start popping it is like popcorn. still if you are lighter it is a good wheel"
5,Great Whell for Price,"Excellent quality. Everything worked as expected including the quick release system. The wheel was delivered true (straight, not bend), however with use over pretty rough terrain it developed a slight bend that required truing a couple of times. Now it's holding true nicely travelling the same rough terrain (abandoned golf course cart trail). The wheel is pretty good looking too, and light compared to steel wheel."
3,Big Ding in the wheel,"Great price, but it showed up with a big ding in the wheel. Like it had been dropped or smashed with something. I guess I shouldn't be surprised for the low cost. Rather than send it back, I banged the damaged area back into shape with a hammer and brought it to my local bike shop to get it trued. It works pretty well now on an old Schwinn bike I restored."
5,Greenbook,I am planning on selling some of my Snowbabies and need this information for pricing. This will be a great help
2,Adequate for very small cameras.,"If you have a small camera, this one is adequate. The all-plastic design makes it difficult to adjust the height and the tilt because plastic tends to stick together when tightened. Loosening the knobs is a big pain and the legs tend to ""give"" a little bit when you use it with a bigger camera."
3,A bit overpriced for what you get,This tripod is made almost entirely of plastic (except for the legs and a few other parts). I would not mind that so much as long as its price was below $10. It is a simple product.
4,First release by one of the most interesting argentinian bands during the 90s,"""Los visitantes"" was the name of the new formation created by Palo Pandolfo after disbanding ""Don Cornelio y la Zona"", and their style was a logical continuation of the direction that Don Cornelio was following when they were still together. ""Salud Universal"" is a very eclectic album, and some of the tracks sound very angry and raw. The lyrics are the highlight, though, infused with that particular brand of urban poetry that is almost a trademark of Pandolfo. ""Playas Oscuras"" was a hit in Argentina back in those days, to the point that it was broadcasted as a jingle for a popular rock radio, with the lyrics modified (the original one is about suicide). Other highlights of the album are ""Carne Nueva"", ""La Grieta"" and ""Cataratas de Amor"", based on a short story by Horacio Quiroga."
1,Very tough reading,"While this book provides quite some information on CAN (even to a degree where you don't care anymore) it is overwhelmingly hard to read. The educational value is practically zero. Since reading this book was a futile attempt, I used it several times to look for references on specific CAN topics and was disappointed every single time."
4,CAN : Everything you want to know about it,"This is a real good book. Well written. Whether you have never heard about CAN before or you are looking to find how to apply CAN for the application you have thinking of, this is the book.Its practical examples and chapters are well written."
3,Were happy with it until it stopped working...,"We were extremely satisfied with this DVD player. It has very good headrest mounting system, so our long car trips became fun for our at the time 2-year-old. It hasn't been even two years since we got it, we started hjaving troubles with it. The DVD wouldn't strat giving us an error message (H03). We sent the unit to the authorized service center, where it was refurbished (or replaced with a refurbished unit). A month later - the same problem. Now I'm thinking about getting a different player.."
3,Portable DVD Player,"Purchased this to use on the airplane but I am a bit disappointed. The battery life is marginal. I have to increase the speed of playback to watch an entire movie of around 2 hours. I decreased the brightness as suggested but then the picture is difficult to view. Other than the battery life, the unit works great!"
2,i should have listened,"i usually read the bad reviews first since the good reviews might be written by employees of the product but i should have listened to the one star review. the screen image is NOT sharp, all the edges are indeed pixilated, and overly contrasty. and since this is about viewing a movie i have to give it low marks. also if you view at a moderate angle you lose the image. there is no remote, and if you tilt the screen you cant get at some of the controls. the tag says it has the divx codec so that is a plus, but i havent tried it yet. i usually use a small sony vaio computer about the same size as this panasonic dvd player to view my handheld movies and the screen on that is very sharp so my expectations might be too high but shame on panasonic, i have many of their usually high quality products and i expected better."
2,A Big Disappointment -- And a Big Step Backwards from Panasonic,"There was a time when Panasonic made, arguably, the best portable DVD players. That time has passed. I'm surprised that so many reviewers praise the picture quality of this model -- it just ain't there. Having used earlier Panasonic portables, maybe I was expecting too much. In any event, I got too little. It's okay in a crunch, I suppose, and my kids don't seem to mind the subpar picture (colors, saturation, sharpness are all off the mark, even with the (limited) adjustment the unit allows you). Okay, it didn't cost an arm and a leg, but it's a big letdown, all the same. I'm getting way better picture quality on an ancient Aiwa portable DVD player, as well as a five-year-old Toshiba. Oh, and the unit looks and feels cheaply made, too. Not Panasonic's finest moment."
1,Buyer Beware : Panasonic Discontinues Batteries Making Their Players Inoperable !!,"I purchase in 2004 a Panasonic DVD-LX9 portable DVD player for $800. Until recently, it worked fine. However, the built-in but detachable battery just went bad and needs replacing. Panasonic has discontinued the battery, and without it the player won't work even on mains power ! So, my expensive investment is now quite useless ! All Panasonic is prepared to do is offer a small discount to buy a much inferior unit. SO MY ADVICE IS : DON'T BUY PANASONIC LEST THEY DISCONTINUE THE BATTERY LATER !!"
2,am i missing something?,"i bought this solely on the reviews here on amazon. nice little player, easy to use but the screen as far as i'm concerned is pants. have tried various settings but the edges are jagged. no better than the cheap chinese makes i looked at. it does however feel better built.UPDATE: I think I mis-judged this slightly. Having just returned from my family vacation have realized that my son really doesn't care if the screen isn't perfect and it kept him quiet for a fair %age of a 12 hour flight. And to be honest even for my eyes after a while you dont notice the imperfections. for the money a great travel tool not to be left at home..sorry Panasonic, if i could up my rating i would but not sure i can"
4,Works well,"This products works as advertised. My only disappointment was with the screen resolution: only 480x234: much less than what I was expecting from an 8.5 inch screen. For casual movie watching on a plane, however, the resolution is not a big deal and the long battery life is a nice plus."
4,LS80,"Received the LS80 to replace my wore out LA-95. While the picture quality is a bit less than the LA-95 it does play well. The standard battery will go about 3 hours. I acquired a Lenmar DVDP703 battery and it how plays in excess of 12 hours most times. The play time depends on the movie(disk speed) and the brightness of the display.All in all, its a GREAT sub $200 portable, but if you are expecting it to perform like the LA-95.($700) or equivalent, It 's not quit there...."
2,Portable DVD player.,Picture quality is very good but the sound quality is poor. Can hardly hear when volume is turned up all the way.
1,Marketing deceiving! Needs additional $60-100 battery,A previous reviewer is correct on all counts. Marketing is down-right lying on this packaging. This DVD player lasts only about 2.8 hours on the provided battery. The 6-hour advertising was the reason I purchased. You must purchase another long life battery to get the six-hour time. I think it's a CGR-711 battery.
3,Good picture - not enough battery,"The form factor, weight and user interface are excellent. The ability to position the screen directly over the machine makes it more enjoyable to watch sitting in coach on United even when the passenger in front of me reclines their seat. Biggest complaint: the battery wouldn't play a whole 2-hour movie. Very dissapointing."
3,Use this book as a second or third resource.,I would say this book rates as a second or third resource when preparing for MCSE testing. The Microsoft publication for Networking Essentials is probably a better choice for a first level resource when preparing for test 70-58
2,Not detailed enough for Exam Study,Although has much good information and is easier to read than the Windows 95 Resource guide. The questions at the end of the chapters are too simple and there is a lot of information missing that you need to know to pass the exam
4,classic's together,"the bonus songs make this a must buy for any w.a.s.p fan. who has a record player anymore to play the old singles? the albums sound better than ever. some of the songs are a little dated, as far as lyric's go , but 90% of it beats any of the so called metal that is out now. the only bad thing about this box set is the live ""blind in texas"" track. it has a fan singing.it's pretty lame. i get the point, but rather not listen to it. other than that one track, these cd's have not left my rotation in weeks. these cd's still get me going. rock on!"
4,Necklace,"The product itself is EXACTLY what I ordered. I ordered this as a replacement to the previous one I'd bought almost 10 years ago. The necklace itself is quality, however take precaution to not get it wet as the silver will wear from the copper material it is made from. Shipping was a couple weeks longer than promised, but overall really satisfied with my purchase. I would buy from this seller again!"
2,Caution,"Aleve can cause severe allergic reactions. My husband took it for pain in his knees and it worked great....then he developed a severe rash, hives, itching. First was diagnosed as contact dermatitis. He had stopped taking all medicines except his Blood Pressure meds. He started back on the Aleve as his pain in his knees came back and then he got an even more sever reaction. Severe hives, rash, etc. Use Aleve with Caution."
2,Makes you appreciate how good the original versions are,"I was looking forward to hearing John Farnham's interpretation of some Classic Australian Songs. I guess he got the idea from the success of Rod Stewart's series of albums ""The Great American Songbook"". And it is an excellent idea, after all there are some really great tracks written and performed by Australian artists.Unfortunately, for me anyway, I found John's renditions slow, bland and similar. Which is a shame and I was really dissapointed. On the bright side it made me realise how good the original songs by the original artists are by comparison. I listened to the CD once and I doubt I would again so I guess I will sell it. That's why I like ebay so much :-)John Farnham is a great singer with a great voice and some of his work is outstanding. Maybe he needs to concentrate on material that better suits his unique talents."
3,Thought it would have been larger,This works but I had to purchase a longer chain to put it on my hammock stand. The grandchildren love to swing on it.
2,great for a while...,comfy & soft- but quickly became unraveled and unsafe. This did not even last one summer.
1,Cheap Quality! Worthless!,"I bought this hammock knowing it was on the cheaper end if the market. While the delivery was fast and my initial reaction was ok, the cotton ropes tore in 1 week! I barely used it, maybe three times, and after one week, 6 or 7 ropes that pass through the wooden frames completely tore apart. Basically you get what you pay for. Dont waste your money though this wont even last one summer."
3,Gallop's Tri-Annual Church Survey Results,"This is a compendum of Gallop's 3-year survey which measures levels of religiosity by region, denomination, racial ethnic group, education level, community size, age, gender, and political affiliation/philosophy. This includes pre- and post- 9/11 religious trends.Items measured: (1) Importance of religion in life; (2) Can religion answer problems of today or is it old-fashioned and out-of-date? (3)Is religion increasing or decreasing its influence on U.S. society? (4) Membership in church or synagogue, etc. (5) Weekly church/synagogue attendance. (6) Frequency of church-going (7) A profile of major faiths and trends in faith 1947-present; (8) Denominational profile (Protestants) (9) Born-again or Evangelical Christian profileThree major sections are also written up in this report:(1) An overall summary of the survey(2) Gallup Index of Leading Reigious Indicators(3) Religous Beliefs and Practices of America's teenagers."
1,"""Ocean Surf"" : Music CD","This CD is disappointing. There is no provision available to listen to a sample from it, and the entire CD comrises sounds of surf - without any accompanying music - that becomes totally monotonous and repetitive after five minutes listening."
5,"awesome sonatas, awesome performance","For years, Schubert piano sonatas were neglected by pianists. Now, however, there are many exponents of this wonderful music, and foremost among them, in my opinion, is Mitsiko Uchida. She perfectly balances a classical appreciation and a profound romantic emotionalism. Although the B-major piano sonata is a youthful endeavor and a fairly interesting work, the great piece on this CD is the a-minor sonata. I will not go in depth into its intricacies (I had written a paper on it), but it clearly portrays Schubert's genius in making simple turns of phrase very chilling. One example: the piece opens in octaves; at the beginning of the development, the first theme is very simply harmonized and its creates the MOST dramatic effect. Also, the first movement coda estremely exciting. Of course, Uchida plays these pieces with great appreciation for both emotional and structural content. Buy this CD!"
2,ehh.,Not the best spiderman. Love the cast but didn't hold my attention with the script. Entertaining and visually fun though.
2,Amazin Spider Man ?,I was dissapointed with this movie entirely . The 3 D was O K but not what I expcted .
1,What a crappy signal and a Rip off.,Chose to rent online instead of walking 3 blocks to a RedBox. Will not happen again. I want to give it zero stars.
1,VERY bad video quality.,"We did not rent HD as we never do and most times the quality is just fine, but this one is very unclear and uncrisp. Disappointed we spend the money on this!"
3,BORING,"IT WAS A REMAKE OF #1. GENTS, THIS ACTION HERO REQUIRES MUCH MORE THAN SPIDER WEBBING, PLEASE REVIEW THE COMIC BOOKS."
3,"For God's sake,be Itunes-friendly!","I have to say up front that I still have not seen this movie for one reason...I am sick and tired of paying good money to own a copy of a movie(any movie)and not being able to transfer it to my IPod.I was,until recently, working for a company that had me flying all over the country and it was a godsend to have movies on my Ipod to watch to pass the time away. I will probably still wind up buying this film, but I am forced to be much pickier which films I spend my money on(Are you listening,Sony?).So please give us a break on the Ultraviolet and Flixter B.S."
3,Different,"I think it's time we give Spiderman a break....he's been through a lot. It's a different take on an abused story-line, that has been written a million times. Will it entertain you for a bit/....sure. Great movie? no...not so much.Note to Hollywood....let's leave this story alone for a while..."
4,Good,"Would have given 5 stars except for the obviousness of the plot. Not that obvious is always bad, but the spider-man story is well known considering it's not so long ago release. In any case, the small changes in some details of the plot, such as his parents, the many spiders, his intelligence, etc... made it a solid 4 rather than the 3 it would have gotten without them."
3,Too soon,I liked it.But I felt like I was watching the same Spider-Man as a few years ago with different actors and equally uninteresting villains. Mehhh
5,LOVED IT!,"I think this is the best Spiderman yet. Loved the interactions between the two main characters, and Andrew Garfield made an excellent 'nerd whos shy'. Amazing job!"
3,I enjoyed it.,"I don't know why we needed a reboot but I watched it nonetheless. I did enjoy all the actors performances but the story felt weak. Also, for some reason the special effects seemed cheesy, which is weird considering all you can do with cinematic technology!"
2,Peter Parker has Parkinsons,Andrew what ever his name is acted the part like the victim of some sort of spas disease. (no offence to the Parkinsons family)
1,Terrible,"Compared to the previous spider man this movie was not good. Not enough fighting and hard to follow. I just feel like it was a bad remake. I agree with a lot of the reviews in context of the acting and plot. I'm not sure how people rated this movie 3,4, or even 5 stars."
2,Simply sucky,I'm a great fan of spiderman ever sinse I was little but I was week minded I would not feel that way anymore but I'll say this the lacked a lot in story and started off pretty slow and really didn't gain that much of momentum. Story was completely backward and made no sense I like the other three a lot more than this absolute garbage.
4,I liked this movie. Different from earlier one,The story starts from the beginning but take different paths at times. Do try to relate with the old one in order to it more.
4,The Amazing Spider-Man,"Was very enjoyable. Not an all time classic, but was what I expected. Kept my interest and was quite entertaining."
5,The best of the Spider Man movies yet!,"I have seen all of them and this one is my favorite. The story line is great, I love how it develops and then provides great action toward the end."
2,It's been done!,A good premise that's been overdone. I am also a 3D enthusiast and found it to be sorely lacking till the 2nd half of the movie. Would not reccomend it!
3,Over-priced,Literally a day after this movie was ordered I found it at Wal-Mart for $8.96. Not worth the trouble to send it back.
1,Completely Unrealistic,"This film was one of the most unrealistic pictures I've seen in recent history. I attend the theatre to see a viable representation of the real world. I was disappointed to find the those involved in the creation of this film feel differently, it seems.After hearing rumors of Spiderman's superpowers from a friend in Grade School, I sought out a spider in an attempt to gain powers of my own. Unfortunately, this poor advice led to a lengthy stint in a local Hospital and the removal of my left arm. As you can imagine, it has taken me twice as long to construct this review as it would have were the World free of unrealistic films such as these."
3,was not really Amazin shoulf've been called cheesy Spiderman,"I Wanted to give the movies 2 and a Half stars but this option is not available, I think the movies was okay, they made it little bit cheesy with all the comments from Spiderman as well as the fact there was not that much action, for such a long movie they really did not deliver with anything, the effects were not really great, the storey line change was pretty week, I guess Toby McGuire was so disappointed for what they have done to the franchise , they did not think to change the boots for the main actress! Neither coming up with better lines,Overall I was not so sad about renting it, as it was not really bad just did not measure up to any of the real three movies nor to the advancement in technology since the last spider manThe main question is if I would watch it again? Only if it was free on prime"
4,A Somewhat Misleading Movie Name...,"It should've been called 'The Mostly Amazing Spider-Man, Thanks In No Small Part To Andrew Garfield's Great Performance, But Somewhat Hindered By The Tonal Uncertainty Pervading Proceedings' ...... Snappy, huh?"
2,"mediocre knockoff with good fights, but really lousy ""drama""","I am sure that there are aficianados out there who know why the producers made this, why the changed what they did, etc. But I simply did not see the point of this: not only does it do his origins differently, but it recreates the character with a different and far inferior actor compared to the original, Tobey Maguire. His emotional struggles left me feeling , ""meh"" and the story was insipidly formulaic. The only thing to recommend itself was the fighting, which wasn't at all bad, but again, Tobey Maguire was far far better.Very disappointing. I am a lifelong spiderman fan, loved the Tobey Maguire series, and was hoping for more. Not recommended."
2,"""STOP LYING""","This movie only make since to those who don't know the comic's. The story and villain were on the same level weak due to lack of interest. When has it become cool for Spider-Man to take his mark and show his ability the citizens. As for the 3d fight scene at times it was to animated. This is a movie that should have been a Saturday night prime movie on nbc. Please don't be fooled real Spider-Man fans. This one of the top 5 worst over hype superhero movie ""EVER"""
3,cracked dvd box,the dvd box holder was cracked when I had received it. it did arrive promptly on time though which was a plus.
2,What happened to the original cast.,"I was so excited when I learned they were making a Spider-Man movie. The first three movies were awesome movies, I loved the cast. Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, Willem Dafoe, James Franco, and Rosemary Harris. I really appreciated this cast. So when I saw The Amazing Spider-Man 2012, I asked why did they change the cast like that? Unfortunately, I didn't like this movie. Mind you, I'm a big fan of Sally Field, and Martin Sheen. This movie had the scrip of the first Spider-Man, just with a different cast."
2,"dejavu and hey, i know you.","saw this movie in the theatre and boring. same thing different take. saddest thing is that, they used the same guy from the first movie,(the armed robber who robbed the wrestling owner) for this movie to drive a cab. i guess hollywood is getting low on actors."
1,Painful and Dull,"There is simply no getting around that this movie is a weak, poorly constructed film. The plot is barely held together with a rerun of the story we all know by heart (and if you don't, what's wrong with you?), which leads to a yawn-fest as you're forced to watch things that have to be ""just different enough"" so as not to completely copy the previous movies. Random events, dropped plot points (there really is no ""untold story"" so please, don't fall for that), unlikable characters, a villain that is not only paper-thin in his motives, but so horribly brought to life on the screen that it's truly embarassing to watch, this movie has nothing good going for it, even the CG is outdated.If you want an enjoyable Spider-Man movie, watch the first two Spider-Man films from Raimi. You'll have fun, you'll laugh, you won't feel like you just watched what is likely one of the worst superhero movies to come out in quite a while (at least The Spirit was hilarious in it's absurd horribleness)."
1,Garbage,who picked this b-list actor to play the hero for a movie like spiderman. the guy didnt deserve the role cause he cant act if his life depended on it. movie is a waste!
3,The Tobey McGuire Spiderman is Superior to This One,"Sorry, the Tobey McGuire Spiderman is superior to this Spiderman in pretty much every respect.I have no idea how anyone can state that this Spiderman is better. With that being said, this Spiderman isn't bad per se, its just 100% completely unnecessary and the Tobey McGuire one is just so much better."
1,bull sh^t,"This movie sucks. Batman Dark Knight rises way better then this crap. wow. bull. throw up. hate it. ewww. Spiderman with Toby is way better!! 1,2,3!"
2,Prefer Toby McGuire...,I preferred how Mr McGuire played the role of Peter Parker (doesn't really matter about Spider-Man because it's in costume and CGI). He brought a sensitivity that was severely lacking by the new actor (his name escapes me) playing the role. Also redoing the origin of Spider-Man was redundant because it had already been done in the 1st movie. I think this franchise is starting to run it's course...
2,Lots of fancy cinematography but poor story development,"If you are expecting a rich story with character development and a thoughtful plot (like the McGuire Spider-Man's), you'll be disappointed."
2,Dumb,"Why did this movie do so well? Our taste in movies has become so dumbed down that this movie is considered a big hit. An insult to all superheroes past, present, and future."
2,just not that good,not as good as any of the previous 3 from acting to directing.dont understand why this one had to be made
2,dont buy,I liked the actors in the movie and the new guy playing peter was better than maquire but i do not think the whole franchise needed rebooting. most people going to tjis movie have seen the others and the younger kids going dont care abouut origins the only really good parts are ten fight scenes during the last half hour
2,Terrible,An embarrassment to the Spider Man movies. The concept for this movie should have been turned into a TV series for teens akin to Smallville.
5,My boys love it!,My husband and 4 year old son love this movie! They saw it three times in the theater and so I bought it for them when it was released on DVD. It does not scare our 4 year old and his favorite part is when Spidey tells the guy if you're gonna steal cars don't dress like a car theif. It cracks him up every time! This movie is a must for super hero lovers :)
2,Not So Amazing,Couldn't help comparing to the original. While lots of neat effects just found it boring. Waste of $4 in my opinion.
3,it's okay,"having been in on the original spiderman comics as a kid i was wondering how this reboot would come out...it was just okay...i think the ""do you really think it was an accident"" refering to peter being bitten was way out of line..and doesn't stay true enough to the original story line...otherwise not horribly bad..just not hooribly great either..."
2,Fantastic Example of Hollywoods Lack of Creativity,"I was hoping for a brand new story and new villains, or some other cool new stuff, but then I saw the actual product. Of all of the great Spiderman movies they COULD have made did they really need to retell the ""How Peter Parker Becomes Spiderman"" story?"
1,SpiderMan for 12-year-old girls,"This SpiderMan story discarded all the wit and fun and action, and replaced it with whining drama that had no emotional realism."
3,okay,Probably my least favorite of all the Spiderman movies. I think I may like Tobey McGuire as the role of Spidey. Average movie
1,Ultraviolet Sucks,I bought this version because I like getting my movies as a Blu Ray plus an iTunes download. This DOES NOT have an iTunes download. Instead they give you an Ultraviolet copy. I tried installing the download manager but that didn't work. Ultraviolet totally sucks. I'm never using it for another video ever again. I'll get my digital copies off a torrent if the studios won't provide me with the format I want when I shell out money to buy their products.
1,UltraViolet is TERRIBLE!!,UltraViolet will not provide an iTunes Code. I will ***NEVER*** buy another disc that contains an UltraViolet code. UltraViolet is not compatible with my current iTunes Movie Collection.
4,A - Content; F - Delivery,"The movie was great. The transmission (streaming?) of it not. It took ~ 30 minutes to see the final 5 minutes. My Internet connection tested fine, and I had recently upgraded to a faster transmission speed. It was very exasperrating."
5,Fantastic ride,Great entertainment. Always enjoyed the spider-man adventures and they keep getting better and better. The video came in a timley manor and was very well satisfied.
2,A non-offensive review,"I didnt care for it and Im glad I only rented it. There, that didnt hurt anyones feelings did it?"
3,"Ok,it mostly for teens.",I know why my kids like this movie so much it looks more like a movie for younger audiences. I like other Peter Parker whos conscience was always heard. Along with Jonah Jameson who is absent in this one. I think the other Peter Parker reached a far wider audience but this movie had far more action and less emotional drama.
1,Unbelievable - BAD,This is almost exactly the same storyline as the 1st one with different actors. So dissapointed in Sony for releasing this.
1,Pain in Blu-Ray Format,"The movie started very, very, very, very, very S L O W L Y, and seldom got any better. Poorly written, poorly laid out, unbelievable due to the stupidity of the characters and story, creating total movie viewing dissatisfaction. Even willful attempts to suspend any logical expectations could not help lift this digital disaster from its self dug abyss. So disappointing. I finished it only because .... good question, why did I finish it? Skip this dog!!"
2,No digital iTunes copy = NO SALE,"With the price of Blue Ray movies I refuse to add to my movie library movies with only Ultraviolet Digital copies and no ITUNES DIGITAL COPY ! THe movie industry is getting more & more selfish everyday. They just lost another sale from me. I think I will buy Prometheus, I can watch that on my IPAD !"
4,Worth the money,If you love this series and this character than just buy this and quit thinking about it would you? Huge fan of the serious and the cast and can't wait for the next movie.
5,spider man,The movie was really good. It was way better than the Tobey Maguire movies. I liked Andrew Garfield way better as spider man.
3,Couldnt keep my attention,"I didnt buy it from amazon but i rented from redbox. It was really good at first, but i cannot tell you what happens throughout half the movie"
3,The pace is a bit slow,"It's an OK movie. I felt the pace is a bit sow, the lizard make up and special effect was kind of awkward."
4,Initially Reluctant,"When watching the trailer, I wasn't sure about the new spiderman, but definitely enjoyed the plot and look forward to the implied upcoming sequel. Will definitely watch when it comes out."
2,didnt work,i downloaded this but it didn't work so i got it from netflix. I liked the movie though. Different from what I expected
2,Decent popcorn flick but nothing special...,"The first three Spiderman films were fresh and original, unlike this sub-par remake. Average acting, a weak plot, and too much CGI all contributed to produce a Dollar Theater popcorn flick at best."
4,Just about perfect,"The story arch of this new spiderman series looks to be more realistic, and less mela-dramatic. However this movie suffers at time with poor pacing. By the time you get to the end for the final battle, one can start to feel ""when is this over..""More so the final battle seemed rushed.. as I believe the pacing of the begining and middle perhaps cut into what time was left for the ending.3D, Now i saw this movie in 3D at the theater, and it looked amazing. However a lot of scenes for the movie were put in place for 3D purposes only, this detracts away from the movie if you're not watching it in 3D. And some of the scenes go far to long, hense the pacing problems.However on the bright side, all characters are well acted and far superior over the previous spiderman series, Gone is the sappy "" oh poor me, im spider man..FML"" I relize that was part of the original comic books, but that always bugged."
1,waste of time,This restart was so bad - complete waste of time. There were too many unexplained subplots and it was too unbelievable.
2,blech,"the actors were ok, the lizard was ok, it just seemed poorly done. I don't know if it was directed poorly, written poorly..not sure where it failed by I was bored. took to long to get going"
2,TOO REPETITIVE,"This movie was a major disappointment. It was like watching a repeat of a movie with different actors. I found this spiderman (Andrew Garfield?) to be completely unappealing. A favorite actress of mine Sally Field, did not impress me this time. And ditto for the wonderful Martin Sheen. Way too much of the story was a repeat of the first Toby Maguire movie. It was a huge waste of money to produce and a total wase of my time and money. Sorry!"
2,Lame,Why do they have to do an origin story every reboot? Everyone knows who and what Spiderman is. They could skipped that part. Instead of redo the origin story again. And they didn't even do a good job at it either.
3,Can watch once,An ok movie - not as great as the previous three. Part of the story a remake of Spiderman 1.
2,Too ridiculous,"Too many oddities and inconsistencies....while the plot itself seemed halfway decent, the execution falls short. The whole atmosphere of the movie lacked a comic book feel, and Spiderman was kind of a dick."
3,Good for a rental,"Not a bad movie, but fast forwards character development, tells the same origin story we have all seen more times than we can remember, and adds very little of its own to the property."
3,Spider-Man 4,"although this is a re-boot of the franchise, it is the 4th film in the series, so I refer to it as ""Spider-Man 4"". That is part of the problem, in that, this is the 4th round with this character, and the deja-vu is starting to set in.The special effects are a definite upgrade from the previous Spidey films; also the new actors are just right for their respective roles as Peter Parker and Gwen Stacey. Having Martin Sheen and Sally Field was also a classy touch of good casting.Also liked some of the point-of-view shots of Spider-Man as he moves through the city- very realistic feel.The villian was also well-played and the effects were scary and creepy.An enjoyable ride, but one you have already been on before."
4,"Graphics great, story changes not so good.",The special effects are worth the watch. The swinging in the air scenes are fantastic. I was not too keen on the story deviations from the original comics. I was surprised Stan Lee let it through. I like these actors better than the earlier movies but Andrew Garfield has that annoying facial tick thing going on. Much like Harrison Ford but in a Teenager.
4,Reboot,"If you liked the original 3 movies i would not suggest this movie for you. I personally hated all 3 and am happy to see Marvel redoing them correctly. The story was more correct to the original comic, the characters were more believable. And spider man is not portrayed as a Anakin Skywalker wannabe crying about everything!"
2,redone and over done,"It was like watching King Kong, the third version - your like ""why"" There wasn't anything new and Andrew isn't Toby. I didn't like it at all."
1,Doesnt work!,Am i doing something wrong? I bought and returned 5 3d dvds ! None of them work!! Every other movie woeks except spiderman. Any ideas?
3,Not near as good as the first 3,"A Spider-man movie without J.Jona Jameson and the Daily Bugal and, just as important, the great Bruce Campbell? I mean what's the point.If this version does anything it reminds us Spider-man fans just how great the first two Toby Maguire movies really were. (Never really cared that much for #3)It's too bad really. I understand Sony's dire need for cash input but instead of starting over they should have simply continued the story line from where #3 left off.Visually speaking of the entire cast Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy the only perfect one. And the whole story line about Peter's mysterious parents, in my opinion, is not a needed one.The other thing they finally got right was Peter's web shooters. (Mechanical not genetic.)This is not a bad movie just not as enjoyable.Finally, given the price of popcorn and Pepsi these days, I feel I was right about not seeing this version at the movies."
4,Amazing Spider-Man,"My wife and I watched this the other evening and we thoroughly enjoyed it. It's a great re-boot of the series. The action scenes were well done, and the monster was great fun. A great family film with lots of fun for all ages."
4,Start of a good series,"We were concerned that they would butcher the Spider-Man Series. I am pleased with how this movie ended up, the kids enjoyed it, and knew the characters. We are excited to see the rest of the series."
2,Lame,"Why do a remake so close to the other and much better Spider man series. The story and acting was horrible, the casting was poor, an instant forgettable film, don't waste your time and money."
4,Marvel does it again,Watching the movie could you really tell its not Toby playing spiderman.The Movie is very good. Can't wait to see the next one.
3,The not so amazing Spider-Man,"The plot follows the same basic plot line of the past Spider Man movies with no real new surprises other than the character cast change. No real chemistry between any one of the new actors in the film and at times it appears that they are going thru the motions' with no real enthusiasm for their effort. This movie falls in the category of ""movies to watch on a rainy day""."
5,Great film,"Hands down, best of the spiderman films. A much needed reboot.Damn English actors are crushing it as American super heroes."
3,Another?,"Not clear why another such movie was needed, as it had no advantages over the first. Enjoyable but totally forgettable."
5,Spiderman,I thought that this was a great way to see spider-man get rebooted. I am a huge fan of spiderman and so are my kids.
3,Not A Very Good Rendition,Bring back Tobey Maguire! This was a mundane version of an awesome story that had me mesmerized when Tobey Maguire played the lead.......bring back Tobey!
2,Don't waste your time,"I had enjoyed previous Spider-Man films, but this remake bored me to tears. I could not wait for it to end. The plot had several large unexplained holes and I thought the acting was over-the-top scenery-chewing canned ham."
2,my movie,It wasn't what I expected. it was very dark and I don't like the movie for my kids. the price and shipping were the only good part of that movie
3,not,"not very good, liked the others better,couldnt get into the new caractors at all, liked the other actors in original version much better."
4,Great movie!,"Great movie, good plot line, awesome action sequences, def recommend to any action fans who are looking for fast paced movie"
4,"Not as good as Toby""s",This was an interesting plot line but the series with Toby Macquire was superior in my opinion. I liiked the approach to thecreation but not enough to give it 5 stars.
3,all right,"As someone who enjoyed the previous trilogy of Spider-Man movies, I was curious to see what this one might be like. Alas, I found myself unimpressed with the reboot. I tried to give this movie a chance, and not all the parts were terrible. I liked that they used the Lizard, instead of using a villain that had been used in the previous trilogy, so kudos for that at least. I also liked how they had Gwen Stacy as the female lead instead of Mary Jane Watson. I just didn't like Peter Parker's actor, I liked Tobey McGuire better, but then, that is just me."
3,"What can i say, it needed Toby","It was an Okay remake, but i enjoyed the ones where Toby plays spider man, seemed more humble and believeable. Didn't enjoy this movie as much as the previous ones...."
4,The Amazing Spider Man,They put a different twist on it but it turned out preaty good in the end. I don't want to give out the ending so enough said
4,Enjoyable,I am a senior who likes to watch movies for the sheer entertainment. I found this movie more entertaining than prior Spider Man movies.
2,Disappointed,"I thought this Spider-man would throw some new twists in the story. I guess they attempted to do that, but it was not enough to make me think this was worth making. I liked the other series and those characters more than the ones in this."
3,other spidy movie was better,"I think it is just me but I like the cast from the other movie. Also, I enjoyed sam reimeis style ratjer than this director bur it was fun to see spiderman swinging again."
2,A joke,"Cheap show, acting is pathetic. Script is rushed and does not flow well. Does not hold a candle to the other Spider-Man movies. Don't waste your time."
3,The not-so-amazing movie,"I've been a fan of Spider-Man since I was a kid. And the first movies with Tobey Maguire were pretty good. I waited to see this movie when it came out for rental and I think I was expecting such a blow-me-out-of-my-seat movie experience from all media attention and hype that I was left disappointed. I love Emma Stone, and she's good in this movie. But there was nothing about the re-boot to the storyline that I felt made it worth doing a new Spider-Man series. Sorry, Spidey."
2,Amazing Spider-man tangled in its own web. Skip this movie.,The Amazing Spider-man fails to deliver like the first three. The first Spider-man and Spider-Man 3 are the best in the series while the Amazing Spider-Man is a lacklustre reboot. Andrew Garfield is a horrible Spider-man. Tobey McGuire is Spider-man like Pierce Brosnan is James Bond. The Lizard is the worst than Dr. Octopus in Spider-Man 2. I didn't like the Amazing Spider-man because none of the actors had the same chemistry as the actors in Spider-Man. Worst movie in the series. SKIP THIS MOVIE.
4,Good reboot,I feel like they only made this movie to establish the universe that Spider-Man will now inhabit. Good thing they decided to work hard on this adaptation and incorporate more from the comics by keeping the characters closer to their comic counterparts and cutting out a lot of the silliness. Looking forward to the sequel.
2,Spider Flop,"The effects are excellent. The acting is great. The story is lame. We did not need another origin story. It is slow. It is ho-hum interesting. It tramples through places we have already been before with these characters. The action is limited. Compare this movie to any of the Iron Man films or the Avengers, for example. We watch this just to see Spidey, but we do not get a spectacular storyline with interesting villains or Marvel cameos, etc. They could have done so much more. What a shame. This movie was like watching a rerun on a boring Sunday afternoon."
1,Worst Spider-Man Movie,I enjoy the spiderman tale and stories. The first three movies were amazing even though they didn't follow the comics. This movie follows the comic fairly closely but I did not enjoy it. For starters all the characters were changed. Some were better than others. Then they went back to the beginning of the story instead of advancing it. I usually don't fall asleep during super hero movies but this one I did. I suggest renting it before buying it.
3,It's alright,Script and plot are weak. I don't know why they made this movie. This is a waste of money. Watch something else.
2,They simply don't respect audiences anymore.,"I think the title of this says it all. However, I think Andrew Garfield is a great actor, this movie is not his fault, in fact he held this film up. Meh, maybe your 10 year old son will enjoy this, I can't imagine what other audience it was meant for."
3,Good special effects but the storyline is very weak...,"I'm a fan of the genre and loved the Sam Raimi treatment. I really didn't like the changes to the origin, because it seemed to be trying to force-fit everything together. Also, there were just too many plot holes to accept (even for a comic-book movie). As for the acting, I like Tobey Maguire did a better nerdy Peter Parker, but I thought that Andrew Garfield was more believable as the wise-cracking web slinger. Also, the villain wasn't nearly as interesting as in the past, so that made it more painful to watch..."
1,Cannot play on google nexus,This cannot be played in google nexus tablet. No way to return the movie also through amazon. Also can download only in kindle as per site . This is not mentioned in movie details page
1,I gave one star so I would have some space to tell you a little about what I think about this. I'm disappointed in Amazon.,"I have a Samsung Blu-ray 3D disk player and a Samsung 3D TV and a collection of eight 3D movies. They all play very well except for this one. The player plays the disk through the feature introduction, including the display of 3D quality, but will not play the feature movie. I sent the disk back to Amazon for a replacement. The replacement disk performed precisely like the original. You should either give me my money back or at the very least a different 3D movie."
3,Doesn't work on Samsung Blu Ray player,I rated a 3 on here. Thought I had a defective disc and sent the first one back to Amazon. Got the second one a week later(very fast shipping btw) and it didn't work either. Spiderman is made by Sony and read there is a conflict and many sony 3D movies don't work on Samsung blu ray players. Tried the second one on a friends Sony player and it worked fine.All other disc worked fine but the 3D movie is the only one that didn't work. Going to trade the Samsung in for the Sony tonight so there is no future conflict between Samsung and Sony.Not faulting Amazon. Was thrilled with their return policy. I have read many have had problems with Samsung players. BUYER BEWARE if you have samsung player.
2,I miss my Peter Parker,In the comics I read from 1 to ????. It was the same Peter Parker and Mary Jane and Johnna Jameson the editor. I think they went too far ahead of where I read spiderman. I was still trying to connect when the movie flew right along and ended.
1,Waste Of Time And Money,"Boring, Boring, Boring! Lead character ""Spiderman"" poorly cast... dorky, spastic and an unlikeable figure. Whose patronage brat is he to hook the lead role? Movie is just another example of more money grubbing, shyster Hollywood producers and directors spewing trash with no regard to creativity or a desire to deliver a quality product with a well-written story line. Could not even finish watching it!"
3,Would rather call it 'The Very Mediocre Spider-Man',"I'm a huge Spider-man fan and watch all comic-based action movies. After being deeply disappointed of the first Spider-man trilogy, I could only expect this movie to be a major improvement. My expectations even got higher when I heard that Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are on the cast.Unfortunately, this movie disappointed me as well. Too much teenage drama, unsatisfying action scenes and another whining Spider-man really let me down once again. I usually enjoy the 'becoming a superhero' movie, but it's nowhere near Iron-Man (which is the top notch 'becoming' movie imho).I still haven't given up and hope for a good sequel."
2,Waste of time,Why do a remake if it fails in every way compared to the original. Special effects are embarrassing. Acting is ok but not worth watching.
3,Better than the first.,But the first was only acceptable. From previous reviews I was expecting something measurably better than the first movie. I just didn't see it. The action was better but I thought that the original characters matched the comic book characters more closely.
3,Latest reboot of spiderman,"It was an okay redo of the spiderman series, but the story line dragged on and I lost interest in the movie towards the end. CGI was great though but not enough to carry the movie with mediocre script."
2,disappointed,"I thought this was a bad movie to sit through. I am typically a huge fan of super hero movies, but this was a total waste of my 2 precious hours. I didn't like the acting, I didn't like the directing and or editing. This blue ray purchase was a complete waste of money."
2,Underwhelming,"What a weak follow up to the three awesome Toby McGuire movies. It has a rushed, paper thin plot and poor character development. I was hoping that the cheap looking CGI LIzard (seriously the Lizard looked like it was half a step up from a Sci-Fi channel orginal movie monster) would bite spiderman's tiny, little head off. Was it worth the price of renting it? No. If it came on TV or was free on Prime and nothing else was on then I'd would watch it, but I am a comic book junkie so even a bad fix is better than none."
4,The Super Hero Genere,Though just another remake ( as most movies are as of late ) it was done well. With a bit of a different twist to it.
1,Couldn't watch it,"We tried renting this via the streaming rental. But playing it on our TV via our lap top (which we do for hulu and netflix stuff all the time) just didn't work. The movie was horribly glippy and wouldn't play smoothly at all, it also looked terrible when it did play. Thankfully we tried it via a promotional deal, so we learned our lesson the cheap and easy way."
1,Great movie - don't believe the digital copy lie,"I loved the movie and would love to have it. But don't fall for that misleading Ultraviolet ""digital copy"" lie. If you can't watch it on your digital device while you're on a plane then YOU don't have a digital copy. THEY have it, and they might even let you watch it, if you can log on.Pass"
2,More or less awful,"The fact that this movie made so much money breaks my heart. Besides decent acting performances by the cast, there's nothing to like. The pacing is awful, the characters are schizophrenic, the effects are hilarious, and the music is forgettable. Stay away."
1,The amazing spiderman,Dumb movie enough of the remakes make something new. Half the time you couldnt even understand what spiderman said stupid screenplay.
3,"Good Action, Clean Vocab, Streaming Issues","Just did not grab my attention like I felt it should. Kids liked it. We had a very bad experience with streaming on this movie. Our service was interrupted at least 8 times during the movie. Not sure if it was Amazon or Suddenlink...either way, not happy. Usually Amazon is very reliable on streaming."
3,Spiderman Redone,"I personally enjoyed the Tobey series of Spiderman movies immensely. This is an okay remake. Except for the peformances by the actress playing Gwen Stacey and Dennis Leary, I believe that the casting for this movie was off."
3,The Amazing Spider-Man,The Amazing Spider-ManAndrew GarfieldHow do I rate this product?It's okay ...The Amazing Spider-ManAndrew GarfieldHow do I rate this product?It's okay ...
5,Spidey is the bomb!,Best Spiderman out of all the others! The new actor fit well with the new 'Spidey' script and I enjoyed the edgy attitude thewriters gave for this Spiderman. Although Tobey McQuire in the previous films was a little more buff this the new scrawny Spiderman made the story more plausible and real. Sally Field as Aunt May gave a surperb performance and Charlie Sheen was an ok uncle. All in all for me this was the best Spidey!
1,Wouldn't load and I still got charged.,I tried to watch this movie through my BluRay player and the movie wouldn't load and I still got charged as if I watched it. Pretty disappointed.
5,"Move over, Toby Macguire!","SO MUCH BETTER than the original Spiderman franchise!! Emma Stone is a gorgeous leading lady, and is FAR more likeable than Kirsten Dunst. I never like Toby Macguire as Spiderman, so this was a refreshing surprise. A superhero doesn't have to be big and muscular to be believable. When it comes to Spiderman, this film DELIVERED."
1,Webs,Unfortunately first movie I downloaded and didn't see because I missed the time limit for Kindle rentals.Will have to try again.
1,juvenile and shoddy,"WE rented this as a streaming video. While I didn't expect it to be be as well crafted as previous Spiderman movies, I have to say that with even those lowered expectations, I was extremely disappointed. The script/writing were pathetic. I felt I was watching a movie for 10 year-olds. Every time a character did or said something contrived and silly, I was forced to constantly note ""it's a movie""... I couldn't suspend my belief for a second to get into the film at all. Really, I honestly wonder how such a film got made and am very sorry I spent 4.99 renting it-- further contributing to the very undeserved royalties it got.I love sci-fi and was a big comic reader as a kid, so I don't think I'm pretty flexible and open with comic-conversion films. But this movie was painful to watch. I would strongly advise people to avoid it."
1,sadly disappointed,"Movie skips and freezes. I thought this was another episode to the Spiderman franchise. Totally disappointed with my purchase. This was a gift, I hope It's not too late to return this item."
4,The Best Spiderman so Far,"9 out of 10, great film, great special effects, great acting, great direction, great actors, what more needs to be said, except slightly adolescent, LOL"
3,Won't be better than Tobey,"I'll be truthful with you, you can't beat what Tobey has brung to Spiderman.Now the movie. There was nothing 'wow' about seeing this, and you just sit there waiting for it. I'm talking about that woooo-hooo feeling at the theater. It isn't there.The 3d version of this movie has nothing coming out the screen like Resident Evil 4 has.What Spiderman needed was Tobey.Save your money as this movie will have severe price drops in 2013."
4,entertaining movie,"Predictable but . little too much CG for my taste, but how else are you going to make a giant lizard man thing?.Fun entertaining movie though. The movie stopped once during playback which was kind of annoying but that could have been my connection."
4,Very nice set for a collector,I had bought this set for my husband to put in his office. I did return it only because my husband had too much already. But this will make a great gift for a Collector.
4,Most authentic telling of Spider-Man's character yet!,"As a longtime comic book fan I can say from my experience that this was the most authentic portraial of Peter Parker yet. Yes, it was released soon after Sam Raimi's trilogy, but this has to do with the fact that Sony HAD to make a new Spider-Man movie or else the rights would go back to Marvel who they are obviously in competition against after the success of The Avengers. That being said, this movie has twice the level of story-telling and emotion than the original trilogy had (especially that stinker of a 3rd movie)."
4,Fun movie!,"I had a fun time watching this.Good acting, excellent special effects, nice portrayal of good and bad characters, and very exciting."
3,Could have been better...,"Personally, I liked the Tobey McGuire Spidey better... I did like the organic webbing that shot out of his wrist as opposed to the comic correct mechanics on his wrists. I thought this Spidey was kid of wacky and Peter was too much of a nerd.If I remember the comics, he was kind of a wallflower but then built the confidence when he became Spidey."
2,Spider Man again.,"Well I liked the other actor that played Spiderman better then the new one. I just don't know hhoe to sey it, but the other actor was a better actor. And as for the story line, not to far off from the first Spider Man Movie."
1,empty nothing,"How is it possible to create such a week movie?Some good actors in it and yet the greatest disappointment of the year. Hollywood, WHAT IS GOING ON?"
1,Worthless,"My son loved it, but just not for me. Acting was medicore at best, effects were OK., but really not worth watching for me.."
1,Crap,"Found it very cheesy, and not in a good way, I like cheesy. Jokes were way too predictable and lame."
1,Not a refined character !,"Im a Tobey fan,..he was a way better Parker because his character had depth. Tobey's spiderman was more likeable n friendly."
3,just ok...,"like the retelling - bit slow for me, but on the other hand my wife liked it which is unusual for an adventure flick - so maybe folks who like more story will like this one better,"
3,Not bad.,"I liked the movie, but I didn't think it was as good as the first two with Tobey Maguire and it definitely wasn't in the class of The Avengers or The Dark Knight Returns."
2,remarkably uncreative,"it's almost page for page the same story, acting, and directing from the first spiderman with tobey maguire. they did nothing original and although the actors try there's just a lack of chemistry and spidy fun. the only decent part is the final sequence in the school with spidey vs. lizard dude that captures some spidey humor and action. a real ""nothing burger"", plain."
1,WHY? MAKES NO SENSE JUST LIKE THE 2 HULK MOVIES DIDN'T,"Like the 2 Hulk movies a few years ago this makes 0 sense. Is almost 80% the same story what the first of the last Spiderman trilogy was with the romance connection toned down and the friendship out of it, replaced by some strange connection of Peter pursuing unfinished theories with his dead fathers former associate. Why not simply CONTINUE from where the last trilogy left off? Again, Hollywood DE-construction/imagination interuptess."
4,I like it....,"...but then I'm a sucker for superhero movies. This was a good movie, some of the action sequences moved a bit too fast for me, and Dennis Leary's character was a little too one dimensional. But in the end, I still have the same question for Sony that I had when I first heard of this 'reboot'...WHY?"
4,Good movie,"Pretty good movie, good acting and picture just a repetition of previous . I will defiantly watch it again :)"
3,Not as good as original series.,This spiderman is different from te first one. I thought the first one was better because and the 3 previous movies were done much better than this one. 3D effects weren't as prolifick as some of the other movies i have seen.
3,Amazing spider man,"Not so amazing. Big deal, retold story... Enough remakes of remakes already!!! Inept writers cannot create a new story and even when they do, idiotic love triangles always.. BORING! This story was already told. Actors and actresses do good job but for crying out loud, will you people stop with the retold spin already? Glad I did not waste my money buying the video or seeing it with my family at the movie theaters. We rented this thru Amazon from our PS3."
3,Not too sure about this reboot,"Overall, a decent movie.....maybe I'm just fatigued by the greatness of the Dark Knight franchise and the Avengers debut. But this movie seemed to lack the luster of a great super hero movie."
3,It's Ok,"I actor that played spiderman did a good portraying a high school kid full of angst. However, the movie itself seemed to drift to far from the origin story that was more prevalent in the first version done by Tobey Maguire."
4,overall worth watching - just entertaining,What I expected for this type of show - entertaining. I really liked the ending. I envision there will be another spider man movie in the making.
4,Great for a cozy Saturday movie night,I really like the new dynamic couple (Emma Stone & Andrew Garfield) in this movie in comparison with the previous ones. Though I would have preferred seeing Sally Fields's character -aunt May- being better taken care of by the script.
3,Better acting than in Spidey 1.0,"The ""re-imagining"" was interesting and compelling and the acting was quite good. In fact, far better than the teen emo-angst of Toby MacGuire and Kirsten Dunst. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie was a mess. Think Spidey done by George Lucas."
3,No need for additional discs,Having to buy a four disc combo is a waste of money. The reason I purchased a 3D DVD is because I have a 3D television. I have no need for the other discs.
2,Not As Good,"I own all of the Spiderman movies, I, II, III and now Amazing Spiderman. The amazing spiderman isn't amazing to me. The first three are much better. One thing about the amazing spiderman that really irked me is he kept taking his mask off, a lot. He didn't care who knew who he was, and that is not true to the story. I mean maybe a couple of trusted people his aunt, and his g/f aka next door neighbor knew, but not everyone who saw him maskless as frequently as he was in this movie. The characters were not as good or believable as in the first three movies. As I detest Sally Field, from the Gidget days, had I known she was in the movie I would not have bought it."
4,Amazing Spider Man,Movie was full of action..good for adults and kids! Would recommend the movie for a night in with the kids.
3,Meh,I'm glad I didn't pay the full price to see it in the movie theater. I just didn't get into it very much.
3,"Some great effects; lead actor and dialogue, not so great","There are some very nice visual effects in this film, along with some solid work by the supporting cast, but the main actor is weird and annoying so it is harder to root for him even as Spidey."
3,Hard to hear,"It was difficult to hear the dialoque. The music was very loud, perfect for the theater. Then the voices would suddenly drop very low."
3,Entertaning,I did not see the first spiderman series so nothing to compare it to but this movie was an entertaining watch.
4,Enjoyed it!,Best Spiderman in recent times. I really enjoyed the movie. I'm glad I purchased it. Better than the last Spiderman
