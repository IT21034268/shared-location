4,Great for the price,was very pleased with product. great presentation box. crystals are beautiful and are able to be seen quite well given i chose the small size. chain is a little long for the petite size of locket. overall a great value.
1,Broke within 2 days,My daughter bought this for me for Christmas and it broke within a couple days....the stones fell out of the locket and were lost b/c the latch on the bottom broke holding the two pieces together. Very disappointing and my daughter cried. she is 13 and used her own money to buy it.
2,Reality was ugly.,"Not worth your money. Very cheap, very unhappy with this purchase for my mother. She said it wasn't bad but she was just being nice. Not what I expected when I opened the box."
2,Wanted to love it but...,"It's very beautiful and arrived very quick, the packaging was very nice. But, I don't know if it's a one time defect or if it's the workmanship. On the front right side of the heart, it has an opening all the way through. It doesn't look like it's broken, just seems like it wasn't welded together as it should've been. It doesn't affect how it works (open or closing), just irritates me. Gives a perfect heart a flaw. Forgot to mention, I bought it as a gift to give my mother.I gave it two stars because it's still pretty nonetheless, but it's not worth that price. The most I believe it's worth is $25."
1,Not worth the money,It came and was a lot smaller than I had anticipated from the pictures. My wife went to put the birth stones in and it instantly fell apart. Totally not worth it.
3,Small pendant only fits 4 gems,I really like this locket; but I was expecting it to hold more than 4 gems. It wasn't clear to me that there is a separate identical larger pendant that holds more.
2,My 11yo DIL hated this. Why? I think packaging.,"My 11yo DIL hated this. Why? I think packaging. When you package something cheap then it feels cheap. The actual product isn't bad, just poorly presented."
2,Doesnt close well and tilts downward while wearing. Fits 3-4 stones.,"I am disappointed. I bought this for my mother-in-law so she could have her 3 grandbabies with her at all times. She liked the look of it, but it tilts downward while wearing since the clasp is on the back (instead of the top) of the piece. Also, once you take it off of the chain, it has VERY limited opening to insert your stones. I had to do it for her. And it really should be stated somewhere that it will only hold 3 stones. Maybe you could get away with 4, but it would not close all the way. Anyway, one of the stones has fallen out already since the closure is not very secure. And to the prior reviewer that commented that they don't see how it could come out with the chain on...IT DID. Now I have to set out to either order new stones, or return the locket. No time for this!!!"
5,Hit on Christmas morning,The grandchildren had picked this out for their mother and they did an awesome job! The quality of this product is excellent and the chain was not so delicate as those that are sent out with so many other necklaces. It was just so beautiful and the tears in her eyes were too.
4,Mother's Day Gift,It was nice. I would have rather been able to choose which stones to order but it turned out ok. It wasn't as big as I thought it would be. I may buy again but maybe for my young daughter next time rather than an adult.
2,Broken Chain - DOA,"The chain was broken at the clasp upon removal from the package. As this is intended for a gift, I'm glad I opened it to inspect it first. I would've been horribly embarrassed to give a broken gift.Love the design though. I'm going to try ordering another."
2,Disappointed,"Overall I have more complaints than compliments about this necklace. The main issues I have are that you can't see the stones in the locket as well as I expected and the chain goes through the back of the locket causing the heart to hang at a negative angle. As others have noted it is difficult to get the locket shut with the stones inside (I added three)...but with some patience I was able to move the stones around to a point where I was able to get it closed. I love that I could add another stone as our family grows, but am concerned that with how much trouble I had getting three stones in that I wouldn't have as much luck adding the fourth when that time comes. The idea of this necklace is great, but in my opinion the design doesn't do it justice."
4,Very nice gift,Nice gift but I thought it would be a little larger. I hope my niece dosen't have too many children.
2,If it worked it would be great,"As soon as I purchased this unit, I would get a feedback noise that would get to the point that it would overpower the music. When I contacted the company, they replaced the unit once. The new unit did not do it right away, but eventually did it and by then it was out of warranty. Now even contacting the company, they have changed their business model and will not even work with me for me to send the unit back to get it repaired at my cost.Overall not a worthwhile investment, the company does not stand behind the product."
5,Great product!,Easy install into our 2006 Mini Cooper. Works and sounds great! Highly recommended for an alternative to a custom install which would have cost us about $350.
1,Do not buy this,"The DICE is not accepting new product registrations through their web site.The DICE product support website displays their product manuals. Nothing more.Troubleshooting options are limited to unplugging and replugging it in.This means fishing around in the trunk of my car.Further, the manual claims that the product is compatible with a 160 gig Ipod Classic.But it is probable that so much data is not capable of being transferred to the head unit with level of functionality advertised.I should have done my homework before buying this junk.It is not worth the plastic of which it is made.That's all I have to say."
1,DONT BUY DICE,"Whatever you do, don't buy an integration kit from DICE ELECTRONICS. Mine stopped working after about five weeks and they wouldn't refund me because they only warranty their product for 30 days.Yup - an electronic component manufacturer that won't stand behind their product for longer than a month. I should have looked into it before spending the 200 plus.My money is gone plus the additional cash that I had to spend to have it removed - not to mention the money I'll have to spend on an integration kit that actually works (which I'm sure will be backed by the company - because it actually works)"
4,Dream Healer-Adam,Very easy to read with quite a bit of good information. It was more like a conversation with Adam as he shared his life's experiences.
4,Easy understanding of energy healing,"Interesting to read about his background and how he started to develop his abilities. He explaines how energy healing works and has many tips as to how you can work on your own health problems. He shares his thoughts about many aspects of life, and is remarkably mature for his age."
3,Frustrating!,"I enjoyed reading this book but was disappointed & frustrated to discover that there is no way to contact this author. He does not even give a last name so he obviously does not want to be contacted (probably too busy)-- Internet searches brought up nothing. I don't understand why he would bother to write a book in such detail if he does not want to be contacted. If he is so concerned about helping people, seems like at the very least he could provide other names/lists that COULD be contacted!"
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with this book. It was good as far as it went, but it seemed to be very choppy and didn't answer questions that I felt would be present in anyone's mind who was reading the book. Perhaps his 2nd book gives more details about his ability to heal, how he handles this ability, what challenges he faces, etc.Also, because almost no names or other information was given, this book had a feeling of ""made up"" to it. I would like to think that isn't the case, but I wonder why someone would write a book about their gifts and yet hide their names and any information about themselves. What is their real reason for writing it?"
1,DreamHealer Very Basic,Very basic techniques for the readers new to spiritual healing. Nothing new or that has not been said better by more advanced authors.
5,Dream Healer Adam,"Adam is truly a powerful twenty-first century Healer. I not only enjoyed and learned from his writings, but also attended four of his workshops in Burnaby and benefitted from the group healing.We are lucky to have Adam to share his Healing Power with the World. Watch out Canada! The best is yet to come from him. Reading his books will empower anybody to take charge of their own Healing, Adam gives you the tools................. Ingrid"
4,"more story than technique, but still very good","Adam was apparently 16 when he wrote this. Having said that, it is a basic book on how he does healing. There is enough detail that you could copy some of it, though it's far more story than technique.You the Healer: The World-Famous Silva Method on How to Heal Yourself and OthersandAmazing Secrets of Psychic Healingwould give you more background on technique. Keep in mind, though, intent trumps technique. For some reason, people seem to hate those like Adam. I don't know why- are they jealous? He is basically a Kahuna La'au'ao, to use a Hawaiian term, someone who initiates a healing. He basically opens the path, grace, God, mana, chi, whatever term you like, does the actual healing. He is clearly speaking from experience. I am delighted to see teenagers with skills at this level, it gives me great hope for the future. I loved it."
2,Reproduction...,This is a poor copy of the actual poster and the coloring and definition are lacking.
5,Never a cloud in the sky!,"I have owned many planetarium type star simulation programs, and Starry Night Pro 4.x is the absolute best. This is a fascinating tool for both the beginner and expert amateur astronomer. Starry Night is easy to navigate with exciting tours and information about what is happening in the night's sky. The graphics are pleasant and very professionally created.I have found that many other programs offer little or no online support and updates. I became very frustrated searching for the latest information on current events or newly discovered objects. When Starry Night is launched, it automatically checks for the latest/updated files on the Internet. As an author for a popular amateur astronomy web site, finding certain information quickly is very important to me. I really recommend this product for all amateur astronomers."
5,A hilariously funny account of the jazz age,"If you've ever heard Eddie Condon emcee, then you can imagine what to expect from this book: a witty, funny, fast-talking recollection of Condon memories. He certainly had his views and was never shy of expressing them; but he always did it with charm and ready-made punchlines. So, get yourself a book brimming over with anecdotes and giving a really lively account of what it was like in white Chicago in the twenties and New York in the thirties. Meet all of Condon's favourite musicians in Condon's writing again. His book is informative (it covers the years from his boyhood to about 1944) and entertaining at the same time. Excellent reading."
4,Now that's jazz history!,"That's jazz history from one guy who helped create it! I am an admirer of Eddie and he writes this book just like he talks (okay, but without the cussing). This is the way the guy lived and for a while, I lived like that, too."
1,Roxio Ruins Another Good Program,"Had I read the fine print on the box and realized Roxio owned Cequadrat, I would have never bought WinOnCD. After seeing how Roxio butchered EZ CD, I feared the same for WinOnCD. The program will not recognize both of my burners, and two web-site email support requests over the last 10 days have gone unanswered. Not even an acknowledgement of the support request! How hard it is to have the web site send at least a canned email reply acknowledging the request? Support is non-existent."
2,"Could be the greatest show on earth, if....",This show is funny but I hope this grown man and cast is acting for the cameras. If not he is in for a wild ride....seemingly marrying the wrong woman (she wants everything he doesnt) and terrible in choosing friends it will be fun to watch his life fall apart. I hope no 46 y/o old man really can be so self absorbered. It will make you feel very good about yourself and see that money and fame might only complicate and diminish a full life.If you have cable I think you can get on-demand if you just want to watch.
2,Dissappointed ! Not the most ideal for an experienced modeler,"The book is well presented but lot of the coverage is very ambiguous and situational to real railroading not focused onthe aspects of model railroading. I would have expected to see more coverage of layout building, tips and trick, experiences from fellow modelers, but none of that kind to suit my pallate. Rather dissappointed, I must say."
1,color gone wrong,The color of the plates was completely off and did not match the set I currently have. I w as very dissappointed.
3,A little too blemished,"We ordered two dinnerware sets and found blemishes (glazes pitted or not completely covering the plates, bowls or coffee mugs) on many of the pieces. Luckily one set arrived broken so we were able to hand pick from a third set that was shipped to replace the damaged product. Amazons service was fantastic though."
3,Mild support,These are good quality hose and they feel very soft. I was looking for something with a little more compression. The knee length version offers stronger support. If you just need a smoother for under a dress this will probably work fine. I needed a tighter compression for veracose veins.
2,"Eh, I'm Not Impressed.","I thought these would be great, but I had a small basketball of a belly in the front and though I was big I was not the right shape it appeared to fit the belly well. The bottom gusset part just didn't fit right and bagged out."
1,TILTING IS RIGHT!!!,"This accessory could not have been more cheaply made. Thinest metal imaginable. And the three legged base is a poor design choice. It may, stress ""may"", be usable if I build a wider, proper base for it as I spent far too much time standing it back up. It topples with the slightest lateral pressure. Adjustable roller angle is a good idea, just needs to be made for the real world!!! BEWARE!"
2,Not very stable,I bought this item hoping it would provide more stability than my regular single footed cane. I don't know if they are designed to be unstable or if it's just this brand but it didn't hold still like I wanted it to. It moves onto the sides of the feet really easily which doesn't help my balance. I did like the fact that it will stand up by itself when I need to get my hands free for something else. But overall it does not accomplish what I thought it would and that is a more stable mobile apparatus. Maybe I need a larger based quad cane to get what I'm looking for.
5,Useful and Safe,"I just had knee replacement, and this is the cane I used in the beginning of my rehab. It's well-made, stable, adjustable and a good price. The quad base is particularly helpful. I would recommend it."
5,great cane!,This lightweight cane is a great stability aide. I broke a hip then had knee replacement surgery and this quad cane has enabled me to move out of a walker. It's important to be sure the slightly offset feet are positioned to the outside so the cane remains stable and you don't get tripped. My physical therapist said the lighter cane is a great choice and would recommend it for other patients.
3,well priced but HEAVY,This cane was very well priced. You should be aware that this sucker is HEAVY. It's a real workout to use it. I think I will use it only on wet days when i am worried about slipping with my usual cane. Also the hard plastic rubber handle is not very comfortable if you are used to a foam rubber handle.
3,wobbly / uneven,"I bought this cane for my son, who is recovering from a severe ankle injury (with plates and screws in his leg). I tried it out, pretending my own leg was injured, and was very disappointed with it. The bar is not set in the center (it is very un-centered), and the legs are quite uneven, making it very un-sturdy. If I had difficulty with it as a healthy 43 year old, I can only imagine the difficulty it might give someone who is older or has a severe injury."
1,"Very unsteady, worse than standard cane","I have severe arthritis(autoimmune similar to RA) and my husband picked this up for me since I was having such a hard time getting around with the latest flare-up that affected my hip and knee. I knew right off the bat that it was a mistake. It's very unsteady and wobbly, dangerous to someone with balance issues like me."
2,Old product,The product itself was fine but the sticky backing on the product to make it stay in place was NOT sticky at all! Had to modify product to even be able to use it! I am guessing it must have been old?
3,very little articulation,over all a nice piece for x files collectors but not if you want to open and display very limited
1,Kichler Lighting 6051AZ 1-Light Outdoor Wall/Ceiling Mount,"The first words that come to mind when receiving this product - which by the way arrived in lightening quick time- are ""cheesy, light-weight, disappointing""Kichler 6051AZ Architectural Bronze Outdoor Wall bronze"
3,"""Scarlet"" is a misnomer--""Tomato"" would be better.","Otherwise, the quality standard is as good as any other color or piece of Fiestaware!"
1,"Don't bother ordering...you will get a battery charge, not a saw","I ordered the Milwaukee 6375-20 as a replacement for my husbands 12-year old saw of the same make & model. After it shipped, I noticed that the shipping weight was listed as 1.9# on the UPS site...a little light for a 15# saw. When my package arrived it was a battery charger. Looking back at the sales page on Amazon, another customer had the same thing happen last June per their review. Tool King of course blamed the error on Amazon and said that they would remove the listing, but here it is 6 weeks later and the saw that they no longer stock is still for sale here on Amazon. Save yourself the headache and order this from Texas Tool Traders"
2,Could be a whole lot better,"We have had this saw on the job for 2 years, and every time I have used it, it drove me crazy.The blade height adjustment is totally worthless.It sticks and jams every time.You have to reset it way too many times to get into position, which if your trying to get the job done it can waste your time.I always get my Porter-cable to get on with it.Work on it Milwaukee!"
3,"GREAT SOCKS, OVERPRICED","I LOVE MY SOCKS LIKE THE ONES PICTURED, BUT I PAID HALF AS MUCH FOR THEM AT A LOCAL DEPARTMENT STORE. THEY ALSO COME IN WHITE WITH THE COLORFUL KITTIES. THE ONLY REASON TO PAY $8.95, PLUS SHIPPING, WOULD BE THAT THEY ARE NO LONGER AVAILABLE IN STORES. IF I DIDN'T ALREADY HAVE THEM, I PROBABLY WOULD PAY THE ASKING PRICE ANYWAY!"
1,this nude worldThis Nude World: An Authentic Trip Through the World's Most Famous Nudist Colonies,"this dvd is a waste of money. 99.9% of this dvd is shot from the back left or right corner at a great distance as well as shot through clumps of trees. their is one woman that is openly nude for the camera in the whole film. all the film shot in germany looks to be pre-ww2 nazi nature retreats. some of the film is from france and some looks to be in the U.S.A. . these also are shot from bad angles with very little nudity. to sum it up, this dvd is total garbage, 100% grainy b&w . with s&h it's not worth .50 cents."
3,Stardim Deluxe,Build and finish quality excellent. Light pipe not as bright as I had hoped and the pipe shines brightest too high and to the left of desired. Knowing what I know now I would try something different as the front sight of my Mossberg A-20 tactical auto.
4,Good exam/beginner's guide,"I bought this book last week because I am just a beginner at the whole Solaris thing, coming from a Linux background. The book covers a lot of really good timely topics - LDAP, role based access control etc. - and is written real good. It's like an exam guide which is funny - there are loads of review questions in each chapter and little projects to try out. All in all, it's a very comprehensive book for a beginner. And maybe useful for exam study too (are there certs for Solaris 9 yet?)."
3,Certain Tracks were cool,The CD overall could have been a hell of alot better! But one band in particular I can't wait for are the B Movie Rats--They rocked! Will be looking for more by them in the future!
5,Cobra A/C Adapter,"When I ordered my Cobra system this came up as a pop up item - and it was perfect! During the order, confirmation and shipping process I was very well informed about the status of my delivery. The adaptor was the correct product for my purchase - and I really appreciate that! I hate returning items!"
1,No Twain is absoluetly unacceptable,Our office bought one to test and will not buy any more simply due to the inability to append a pdf document. This is a very important feature so I think it gives the other scanners a HUGE advantage.
5,Great Product,"This is a great product. It scans documents, front and back very quickly. It has come in handy in a pinch a few times now since we have had it. This is a law firm and a lot of our clients are going digital and prefer e-mail over regular mail. We're able to scan pleadings and e-mail them for review. OR they can print them and sign them and mail them back to our office for filing with the Court. It has saved some time in that regard. We are interested to see what the possibilities are with the software. We haven't had a chance to ""play"" with the software much. Overall, its a great product, especially if you are trying to reduce the amount of paper in your office/home."
5,ScanSnap review,"Without a doubt the best office equipment investment we have made. It has reduced our man hours and filing time in half as well as reducing the amount of ""hard copies"" of files we saved. We have two of these and I often wonder how we did without them.Walter A. KennedyPresidentCARS, Inc.Jacksonville, FL"
2,Nice machine...if it worked.,"This would be a perfect scanner if it worked as it is supposed to. It's easy to set up, configure and use, very fast, the scanned copies are perfect, and it takes up very little desk space. But...I have to clean the pads and rollers every time I use it and re-copy anything I want to scan onto my own copier paper before running it through the machine or it constantly multi-feeds or jams, sometimes even then. Can't comment on the OCR as I never found one that worked and didn't try this one.Pros: Fast, simple to setup and use, included software is very intuitive. Customer service people pleasant and willing to help.Cons: Numerous suggestions and a new pad assembly from Customer service never solved problems. Only usable at all if you watch it like a hawk to catch the multi-feeds."
1,DOES NOT WORK WITH WINDOWS VISTA,If you have Vista or plan to upgrade... this product is NOT GOING TO WORK AT ALL. Not even basic scanning -- nothing.You will need to buy another scanner for Vista.Fujitsu claims Vista support will be available later this summer... but they used to say that about the winter... and then the spring. They've repeatedly revised the schedule to the point where they can't be believed. Take you business elsewhere.
2,"Good 1-page scanner, lousy multi-page scanner","I've had mine for over six months, and I'm fed up with it. If you need to scan one page at a time, it's fine, and decently priced. So I was mostly happy at first. But if you have to use the page feeder, this machine really stinks. It pulls through 2-3 pages at a time, can't handle bond paper, can't handle paper that's had staples removed, can't handle paper that's not perfectly smooth.So when you want to scan a multi-page document, you usually have to photocopy it first to get pristine pages, and even then your odds are only about 50/50 that it will feed properly.All in all, I wouldn't buy this one again, and would recommend against it for anyone who will use it more than once a week to scan multi-page documents. Mark my words, it will make you crazy."
4,Amazing speed,"This little device is amazing. Very fast and lots of options. Good software, and lots of free stuff comes with it. My only gripe is that it takes a while to warm up, and while that's happening, it'll take three or more sheets at a time. Once you've had it on for a while, though, it works like a champ."
5,Fujitsu ScanSnap S500 for Windows,"Features are good for the price. Very easy to set up and use. I bought a second scanner for another location about a month later. So far, no problems."
4,It's a wonderful and useful book,"The title is, of course, a double entendre. First is the understanding and healing of the effects of rage, and second is the understanding that the rage is authentic, something we own and deal with daily. The person experiencing it develops many positive habits that add to her life and benefit people around her. I am grateful for the clear explanations and the idea that we do not cut out the rage, we embrace it as part of ourselves. Ellen Wall"
3,fact and fiction,"This book is a mix of fact and fiction, but then again many books today are like that. My advice to you is be skeptical about any author that he knows the truth of a major historical event. IF any real truth is found, the media and many REAL scholars such as arecheologists and university professors will be talking about it.There are many books that talk what really happened to Tutankamen, and his brother. Weather he really is Moses, there is simply not enough proof. maybe yes, maybe no.After reading the Da Vinci Code, it makes one think. What really is true. Is history really fabricated by the World Elite and secretly held by Secret Societies.Well, people certainly buy the books that says the later, if they continue to sell, publishers will keep coming out with it.If you really want to learn the truth. Go to Egypt on a tour and see for yourself. There is nothing like personal experience. BEst of luck and happy treasure hunting!!!!!"
4,No sundial paperwork,"The sundial was well crafted and works just fine, operation was near intuitive. I would have appreciated more of a writeup explaining how (time) accurate the design was and a scientific explanation of why it has time inaccuracies. A little history of sundials would have been nice too."
2,bare bones?,"I ordered this for a Christmas gift for my father and was disapponted when I saw what I paid for. It is quite small (3""diameter) and it came in a flimsy gold box that fell apart when I lifted it out of the shipping box. The piece was wrapped in what looked like a yellow ""Scott"" napkin, and a small screw fell out of somewhere when I opened the napkin. I did find where the screw went, but it was very difficult to put it back and I actually had to get a watch screwdriver to accomplish. It also has no instructions, or any information on the piece what-so-ever. It's too late for me to find another gift. In my opinion it is extremely overpriced for the lack of presentation and for the quality of the item."
3,Good product but don't think it will actually function,Easy to order and shipped quickly.Beautiful sundial and everything moves as it should get not sure the compass will work.
3,Uh...Well....,"As a fan of Venom, I'm a tad biased, so I don't totally HATE this book... in fact, if a few things were different, I might actually consider it pretty good.First of all, the art is simply UGLY. It doesn't fit the tone at all. I've heard that Herrarra has done much better work on other titles... here his work looks like Humberto Ramos drew it while riding on a four-wheeler. And while I'm at it, I do NOT like how Venom looks as big as the Hulk. This is why I wasn't 100% satisfied with the art in Paul Jenkin's ""The Hunger"" storyarc (by Ramos).And hey, why didn't Marvel collect this in digest form? Haven't they done that with their other Tsunami titles? Ugh. Hell, they could collect all 18 issues of this series that way, and I'd buy it in a heartbeat. Oh well. At least Mark Millar is reinventing Venom in his Marvel Knights Spider-Man title. The new costume is pretty cool... I'm out"
2,Leaves a lot to be desired...............,"I just received and assembled my Woodstock Nine Roller Table and I must say the Engineering dept. must have been on vacation when this thing was designed. First, the roller shafts are held in place by plastic caps rather than a groove and an ""E"" clip. One of mine was dislodge in shipping and the cap is broken. Second, I had to use a spanner wrench to align the bolt holes to attach the legs. Third, the legs are lightly tacked to the ""U"" channel members and I do mean lightly. Fourth, it is HEAVY....which could present a problem in a small shop. Fifth, one of my rollers is binding so I basically have an 8 roller table. After I weld the legs and put it on lockable casters I might be able to use it."
2,Poorly made,"I found this stand to be poorly made. No matter how much I tried to adjust the stand, I could not get it to be square and level. With all four legs on the floor, one top corner was low relative to the other three. I ended up bolting an MDF top onto the stand and had to shim the low corner. It was simpler to do the shimming job than send the piece of Chinese junk back. With the adjustment, it is doing the job adequately."
2,Clean-up On Aisle Three!!,"This appears to be poor manufacture and engineering. When attempting to mount an older model Sears Craftsman 10"" table saw, a leg began to crumple after I lowered the saw using my overhead hoist. Total weight of the saw with electric motor is 165 lbs + or - a few lbs. I later cut the damaged part of the legs off and cannibalized the individual metal parts for a welding project. I believe that this would support up to about 50 lbs, but even at the weight it will be unstable due to excessive frame twisting."
1,Shop carefully,"These books are great! I love my Cooks' Illustrated Books and use them all the time. My one and only complaint is that they have now published the Best Recipe series and now the Test Kitchen books and they don't have enough recipes to fill them each one with enough unique recipes to distinguish one book from another.A few repetitions is understandable, but they have gone way over the top. If you buy more than two of these books, the third is bound to be composed of a third the recipes from each of the first two. Same test info, everything. This only leaves 1/3 of the recipes as original.Because of this, I say look carefully before deciding which one from this series you purchase unless you want multiple copies of the same testing articles and recipes."
4,'Consumer Reports' meets Julia Childs,"After falling in love with the series, I decided to give the cookbook a try. I wasn't disappointed-- the casual presentation translates well into text, and the book is entertaining enough to read on its own merits.As a would-be cook who lacked a wise mentor who could pass on simple but indispensable techniques, this was the answer to my prayers. Not only are the recipes simple and thorough, but the results have been phenomenal. As if that weren't enough, the reviews of different ingredients, utensils, and appliances have been a huge asset to me as I begin to fill in the gaps in my kitchen. The folks at Cook's Illustrated have done a fine job of presenting a show and a cookbook that are the perfect starting point for those who love to cook but don't have that certain something-- a painless way to go from apprehensive producer of so-so dishes into confident creator of attractive and tasty meals."
1,Disappointed,"I love the ""America's Test Kitchen"" TV program so I decided to purchase the book. Although the information given is the same as that which is shown on television, the format of the book lacks any kind of style which would make it interesting. It is dull, dull, dull. I returned the two copies which I purchased."
3,Excellent......while it was working,"I purchased this unit in August 2008 and used it throughout the summer. I must say it cooled my large living room efficiently and kept it cooled even when I had the oven on. However, its fans are loud and now that it stopped working I wonder if that was normal. Evidently, there are problems with this unit as the company is arranging for a new unit for me.Overall, I was satisfied with unit; it also dramatically reduced my electric bill which is why I am accepting a replacement but for those that are considering purchasing this product bear in mind that there may be a problem some time in the future."
2,Window Air Conditioner,After about 6o days it began making a terrible odor. I think maybe a refrigerant leak. I threw it away and bought another brand.
3,"Fair unit, but noisey","We bought this as a second window air conditioner for our home. Even though it is rated 10,000 btu and our present unit is rated less at 9,500 btu, our old unit cools better & quieter. The Frigidaire looks nice and has many features to it's credit. Is a bit noisey for sleeping or in a small room with tv."
1,UPS Shipping,Product came UPS and was smashed. I would not order anything larger than a CD from Amazon.
4,A good Choice,"I am satisfied with this airconditioner. It is easy to operate and runs quietly.. I specifically looked for a unit that has an energy star to save on electricity,This was important to me."
2,WAY too noisy!!!,"This unit was nice and compact and the controls and remote were good. It also cooled and dehumified well, but I am returning it now after less than a week because not only was it too noisy for me, my neighbors had begun to complain! I don't know how these other reviewers could think it was quiet, but I could hear its loud high pitched hum throughout all the rooms in my apartment! The unit was in a completely different part of my apartment than my bedroom, but it would wake me up every time it switched on. I even had Frigidaire repair people come out to look at it because I thought something must be wrong with it since it was so loud, but they said it was the normal level of noise for that unit - hey also agreed it was very loud and recommended a Gold Star unit. I would strongly recommend against this unit if noise is a concern for you."
2,large flour sifter,"The problem with this sifter is the turning part of the sifter doesn't touch the screen on the bottom, so the flour doesn't move through the sifter very well. I was disappointed with it. Had I seen the action in a store, I would have purchased something else."
2,"Great idea, but poor design","I loved the stainless steel construction and the large capacity of this sifter. However, when the hand crank was turned, only 1 of the 4 blades made contact with the sifting screen, rendering the other 3 blades totally useless. Obviously all 4 blades were meant to make contact with the sifting screen, thus ensuring a quick and easy sifting job. There was no way to adjust the blades so that they worked as they were obviously supposed to. I returned my defective sifter to Amazon, with the disappointing result that I had to pay a restocking fee, even though the item was clearly defective. Now it appears that some other unsuspecting customer will be sent this sifter and have to deal with it all over again."
1,This sifter does not work,I ordered this sifter for my son who loves to cook. The sifter arrived with no nut holding the knob in place. We added the nut so the knob wouldn't fall off. The blades turn but do not touch the flour or other ingredients to be sifted.I am returning it.Not a good product at all.
1,Not at all what I expected,"I don't know if I got a defective sifter or not, but it doesn't sift at all. I can't believe that I paid $20 for something that doesn't even work. Now I'm back to my old 2-cup sifter, which makes for a very hard time when you need to sift three or four cups with your soda/powder and salt!I don't recommend this product at all!"
1,Poor poor quality,"Not sure what kind of ""stainless steel"" this manufacturer uses, but it does rust. And like other reviewers have experienced, the screen doesn't contact the rotating wires, so sifting is pretty poor and slow. This is a real disappointing product marred by lack of quality control. Don't blame the factory - it's the brand that accepted this quality and ships it to customers. They could have easily refused these defective units and sent them back to the factory instead of to customers."
1,Not what I hoped for,You can sift all night and nothing comes out of the bottom. The sifter arms do not rotate close enough to the screen to push the flour down. I end up just mixing dry ingredients with the rotation and dumping it out the top. Certainly not what I was hoping for. If I could just find my mothers old one!!
1,Disaster,"I bought this Noctua case fan after reading numerous good reviews. I planned its installation to be the first step in my second computer build. After a half-hour trying unsuccessfully to fix the fan case to the computer case, I realized the holes in the fan case are TOO SMALL to accept either the rubber grommets or the supplied screws. One simply cannot make more than one turn of a screw before it jams in the hole. Substituting the case's own screws for this purpose produces the same result.A maddening waste of my time."
1,poorly designed tool,"There's only a single support attaching the saw to the base on the right front corner. The entire weight of the saw rides on this. Just a little pressure on the rear handle and you can make the whole base flex 1/4"" or more. If you just need to hack lumber apart I guess it's ok but don't buy it if you want a reasonably clean cut."
2,Accurate-- until it broke!,"This is my second thermometer in a year. It worked well for two months and then suddenly broke. (same thing happened with the previous one). So, if you buy it, save your proof of purchase and check out the warranty information."
1,Junk,"Second time using it in 6 weeks, right at the time baking the Thanksgiving Turkey, it died. Only displayed HI when the thermocouple is plugged in and LO when it is out."
4,Good Device for 3 years,"I've only used this as a thermometer twice; once to calibrate it against boiling water and once to check the internatal temperature of a turkey I was smoking. I have been impressed with its accuracy and relatively quick readout response time. Note: you are paying extra for the Clock and possibly the timeer. In my experience it is the thermometer probe and its wire that break first. I got 2 probes/wires with this unit. If it continues to work this well for a year I would give it 5 stars.This unit worked perfectly for 3 years, but recently shorted out and I've had to throw it away. I was pushing 2 buttons to reset the time and the unit died."
1,Not Reliable,"After my second failure I've given up on this very inexpensive unit. No on-off switch so you must pull the battery when you put it away. Probe is the failure point on both of my units but, that's the most important feature for me. Time to look for another timer w/probe."
2,Doesn't last,The quality on these has gone down. I use this about once a month to cook a pork shoulder. The last one lasted 3 years. This one barely made it a year. Now the thermometer starts ready crazy temperatures
1,"Great timer, TERRIBLE probe - untrustworthy!","It's Thanksgiving day as I write this. The probe on my unit just failed. I had it in the turkey breast, as I was making my sweet potatoes the alarm (which I had set for 161) started to go off. I looked at my thermometer and it had shot to 293 degrees (really???) and then it stopped reading temps at all. It just says HI TEMP. Wonderful. There is no reset, pulling the battery doesn't work, etc. Jumped on Amazon to see if my fellow chefs have been duped as well - and I see that they have!I like that it's a great timer - but don't trust this thing as a thermo AT ALL. Glad I have a backup (thanks Mom!)If you want a reliable thermometer, spend the extra money. Avoid this thing."
3,VEDDY BRITISH antiquarian book reference,"Don't get me wrong, this is a beautiful little book, and it's full of information. But it's British, and book-collecting in Britain (UK) has a very different slant than here in the U.S., and perhaps this should have been indicated in the title. I also mention ""antiquarian"", which is the field this handsome little reference seems to favor, whereas there are numerous fields of collecting more egalitarian which are untouched upon. So if you're into antiquarian books, and want to learn more about the British market, this is the book for you. An overview of the field in general it isn't. For a good introductory text I recommend Modern Book Collecting by Robert Wilson."
4,"Yes, It's Dated And For The British Market, But","This is a handsome binding (for a modern book), with much useful information and many interesting pictures. A great browse for us ""bibliopegists"" (students and lovers of fine bindings). A delightful passage:""Nevertheless, Sir, there are some things more fit to be looked at than others; for instance, there is nothing more fit to be looked at than the outside of a book . . . It is, as I may say from repeated experience, a pure and unmixed pleasure to have a goodly volume lying before you, and to know that you . . . need not open it unless you please . . . There is no place, in which a man can move or sit, in which the outside of a book can be otherwise than an innocent and becoming spectacle.""Thomas Love Peacock, Victorian"
1,junk speaker,The description and pricing of this item made it sound like a quality item. It actually is just another piece of foreign junk. About the size of an egg and the weight of a feather........with a 4 lb. shipping weight. All for $36.00. If I would have seen it and heard it in a store I would have paid no more than $10.00. The seller did get it to me when promised though.
4,Well worth the price,"Generally a very useful product. I use it for small family business matters including leasing, liability releases, etc. In every case that I have created a document I have submitted it to our attorney for review before using the documents. And in every case our attorney has had only minor change suggestions. In large part these are due to local (state or other local) requirements. One improvement they could make would be to allow the software to adapt documents to comply with state laws. I also found the software to be occassionally un-stable and crash. This problem has persisted across two computers first with Windows 98 and later Windows XP. But it is still worth having."
1,Home and Business Attorney not friendly for my computer,"It is an older copy of Home & Business Attorney and I have a fairly new computer and it will not work. I have Microsoft 7. I got a note from the owner this week, but seems due to the fact that I opened the box, she cannot advertise it as new anymore. I;have checked my computer and nothing is wrong with it. I am at a loss as what I need to do."
2,I returned mine,"First, you can not use the roller/ scroll on your mouse with this program (yes, technical support confirmed this to be true)--not the end of the world, but annoying. Second, there were glitches trying to save files sometimes. Third, the options offered for a prenuptial agreement in a community property state were incomplete, and the information led you to believe that you did not have options which truly do exist! At this point I had had it, and just returned the thing!"
1,Don't waste your money,"Don't waste your money on this program. It only contains a few simple projects and doesn't allow you to custom design any projects. Save your money and buy a ""real"" CAD program"
1,Awful !,"Low quality, no foot pads makes the stand slide across the floor, unstable, tips over on full height extension, plastic end caps come off really easy."
2,disappointing quality,"the roller is not true!! how does anyone expect to do quality woodworking with the plank going up and down by 1/8"" when rolling on that stand???!!?I had bought a 5 roller stand from Shop Fox that was OK ( not great) at least the rollers were true and well secured. This on the other side is borderline with insulting the customer.I will avoid Shop Fox from now on."
3,Light duty stand,"Overall this is not a bad feed roller. It fits my Ridgid radial arm saw well. The only thing wrong was the roller-axle is only held in place with plastic slip-on ends, all of which fell off in shipping. I simply drilled each end of the axle and placed a pin through. Now the work well and when folded take up little space for storage."
1,Not worth buying,"I bought the 5 roller stand for use with 16 foot X 1 inch pine boards. Making flooring out of rough cut lumber. Not as a professional, just one large project. The roller went from a planer to a table saw then a router table with minor adjustments. After a few weeks of use the first and last rollers kept falling out and the end caps cracked. Then the roller assembly started coming loose from the stand. I would find a nut or a bolt on the floor. Finaly after about 6 weeks the height adjustment handle stopped working. The threads had stripped out making it useless except at a very low height. I tapped in new threads but now there's no handle, just a wrench and a bolt. I tried to make it work but it's just too flimsy. Seemed like the perfect product for what I needed, but turned out to be a real pain in the ... (you know the rest)."
1,I doubt it can hold 100 lbs.,"Once I opened the package and assembled the unit I felt a sinking feeling in my gut that this is a poorly made product. The first thing I noticed is the rollers are no where near secure to the base. They wobble and twist with any weight to a corner. If you look at the enlarged picture you can kind of notice that there doesn't seem to be enough structual support to hold the rollers. After 2 days worth of use the clamping device stripped out. I took the device apart to see what the clamping nob screwed into - there was ony about 3/8 of an inch for it to secure itself. To make things more compliated the plastic cap on the bottom of the roller shaft fell off so I had to remove the plate on the base tube. Of course, when putting the base back on one of the screws stripped. To make a long story short, stay away from this product at all cost. The HTC HRT roller looks to be of better quality."
3,Too thin for my taste,"I ordered these dishes because I wanted something simple, nice, and white - they fit the bill with a bonus that they are chip resistant. I ended up returning them, however, because they are incredibly thin and light. This isn't mentioned in the product info online - but on the box it says ""now 40% lighter"" (or something like that). I wish I had known this ...they were so thin they felt cheap to me. I guess I like my dishes to be hefty..."
3,Greasy,"This set arived in good condition, except, they were all coated in black oil or grease. Had to wipe all of them off with towels to put them in the dishwasher. Good price, I haven't used the bowels yet, but they seem fine. I just have never had new dishes arrive (or bought in a store) coverd in black grease."
2,NOT AS DESCRIBED,I ordered 4 28-ounce bowls and 1 2-quart bowl. What I got was 2 1-quart bowls and 1 2-quart bowl. I am not happy. I really needed those 28-ounce bowls and half the number of 32-ounce bowls is not a good substitution. I've already waited much too long for this and I don't want to send it back. PAY ATTENTION AMAZON! This is not the product that the company is sending you.
5,Best price anywhere!,"These bowls aren't cheap if you've ever gone to price them. The small bowls are the perfect size for ramen, cereal, soup, spaghetti...you name it. The large bowl is so handy for serving, or even eating from. Purchasing this set is like getting the large bowl for free at this price...plus it's from Amazon so you can get free shipping! My bowls didn't have any strange bubbles or flaws like some of the reviews are saying. Even if they did, it's still a bargain."
5,Great set!,"Mine arrived perfect and packaged as a set. I cannot see any imperfections. The large bowl is nice and big and can hold just about anything. I love the shape of the ""smaller"" bowls which are pretty big as well. I've been using them for pasta, soups (ramen noodle especially) and cereal. I find they keep the food hotter longer since they are deeper than most soup bowls. I also like them for cereal because you wouldn't fill it up all the way and you can walk with a bowl from the counter to the table without it spilling over."
5,This 5-piece set is so versatile!,"I have finally gone back to Corelle and I don't know why I didn't do it sooner!!! I just love this set, in fact I had to buy two!! We not only use it for that popcorn night, but the bowls are great for serving during dinner. Great set."
4,"Nice big bowls, but doesn't stack well like other Corelle products","These bowls are deep and nice to use with noodles or cereals. However, they do not stack as well as the original Corelle bowls - maybe because how they are shaped? Still a nice set of bowls for the price."
5,Very thorough and complete guide book,"The first part of this book covers types of RVs, the Pros and Cons of each RV type, and also other related topics such as safety. The second part of the book covers the inspection process; what types of things to look for and what types of things to avoid while shopping for an RV. The third section covers the buying process; what to look out for in a dealership/salesman. It also provides guidance on how to nogotiate a suitable price and what is a fair price versus the MSRP. For a new buyer, a book like this is an absolute must. Some of the buying tips alone could save you thousands."
3,Basic good info?,"Basic book. It's easy to spot the author's bias. The information on how to negotiate and how to know the right price is not an easy task, and the author seems to think that you will have lots of time and ability to travel to do your research. The author includes some useful information that I will keep in mind as I look for an RV/Trailer. I didn't find a lot of ""wow's"" and found myself saying, ""yea, I guess I knew that."""
4,Buying a used RV,"Great book, but you also need the DVD Ratings Guide for Motor Homes. Now this is well worth the price."
2,Not that great....,"Was not impressed with the book. Most of the information about actually buying an RV is the same as buying any other vehicle. Some of the inspection information was helpful, but most of the pictures were useless - grainy black and whites taken from such a distance that detail was lost. And finally it seemed to be a long ad for his CDs ($$) - which are available for purchase after you become a member (more $$) of his website."
2,"Efficient air conditioner, but some annoying flaws.","This model is very good at churning out cool air to chill a large room. No complaints there. But the biggest drawback is that it's noisy, even at the lowest fan setting. I sometimes have to turn it off in order to hear a phone call. I have other air condiditioners in the house more than 20 years old that are much quieter. Why they can't make a quiet air conditioner today is beyond me. Another irritating feature is the piercing beep emitted every time you use the remote control. I don't need an annoying confirmation that I just did what I did. I don't see any way to turn this gremlin sound off. Some good features are the different cooling modes, including energy saver, auto cool, and sleep mode. But the constant noise makes me wish I had found something quieter, even at the expense of cooling power."
3,Serge Jaroff's Don Cossack Choir,"I would rate this, as well as their other records, as first class, top notch."
2,Overpriced,"Reef-One claims this filter needs to be changed every month, which is ridiculous. I think they lose a lot of potential customers this way. I rinse the filter out in old tank water during partial water changes, and replace the charcol they provide with a little charcol from a $5 jug purchased at PetSmart. I check my water quality (nitrite and nitrate) every 2 weeks and my tank is in perfect shape."
5,I Give this 5 stars only because of the movie Chained Heat is finally on DVD! Not for those 2 other Movies!,"Now i have got to admit I love the movie chained heat! (5 STARS FOR CHAINED HEAT ONLY) Now here is how i rate the rest of those two movies.Now you already know Chained Heat is a 5 star movie.Red Heat it was ok. That is a 3 star movie.But Jungle Warriors, That is a one star movie. (Other words it is Boo-Boo!, and it was a Puke!)But then again I'm Glad that Chained Heat is Finally on DVD! Although it suppose to be release with the rest of the Chained Heat movie! It's to bad i promise my best freind i give this to her as a birthday present! But i got this movie on VHS! So it's all good! I might order it again evendoe i got in on vhs! Mabye! Thanks Amazon!De'Vear SmallAKA Dee SmallsRepresenting Decatur GA!"
5,dmv tests,"excellent preparatory for dmv test in california. the # of sample testsand the repetition practically guarantee a high score, leave a buffer forerrors so a pass is likely"
5,Great Combo Kit,"This is an excellent kit , with an excellent drill and saw. The tools a a bit heavy ,but that's the price for heavy duty equipment. Holds charge well during hard work. Recharging is well under the spec. 1 hour. Love the set and would buy again in a beat. To make it better Amazon had a great price."
3,Great and cheaper then Walmart!,"So its not the fastest shipping wise but hey it still arrived on time! Paying $14 for two of them including shipping was worth it, even though I wish instead of activity papers they would add more rings or other fun party favor but better then paying $18 at Walmart for them. But all in all I am sure the kids will love these along with the batman cans I made from empty formula cans! These were the cheapest I could find batman party favor wise and as I can tell good quality and will purchase again in the future since my son's whole life is batman thanks to my husband :D Buy these you will be pleased."
5,King Solomon Talisman Pendant Necklace,"I wear my Talisman Pendant on a beaded chain (it comes with a leather cord, knotted)which I use for another pendant. This Talisman is for overcoming obsticles. I feel it has inspired me. When I wear it; I become more aware ( catch mistakes, solve problems, & deal with every day matters with a clearer mind)."
3,HUGE,This watch is huge. Wasn't able to find the watch locally to see before buying. It is to big to wear casually. Other than the size the watch works well and provides quick and easy bearings using the electronic compass.
1,No a good product,"This is not a good choice. The watch is oversized, the alarm is faint, the instructions are a chore to read, the wristband is hard as a rock. There is a mistake in the programming. Needs to go back to the drawing board."
2,Expensive,This book was very expensive for what you got. I was very disappointed in the product as a whole but kept it because it was a gift for my granddaughter. The cost was over $8 but should have been priced about $3.
3,Not up to Milwaukie Standards,"I have to agree with the don't buy it recommendation. I bought it on the Milwaukie name but that name is now tarnished. I have a full shop and about a dozen other milwaukie tools that I really like but this one falls short. Everything in the other review is true. Handles hurt if used for long periods, cheap stamped base plate, my blade came with the print on the back side, the lower guard rubber stop is useless because the lower guard catches at the end where it flares so never gets to the stop. If you can find a shop that carries them, go compare them to the competition. And don't compare the 7 1/4"" saws like I did thinking they are representative of the 8 1/4"" ones. No box. Good heavy power coord though."
5,Great product,"I won't pretend that I have owned several polishers before, however I do own several Milwaukee products and this is just another great product. It is used for weekend detailing and i use it all day without any hick-up or problem. I have owned this polisher for about two months and I would definitely recommend this product. It has plenty of power and it is built to last."
4,Good Milwaukee tool but........,"I've owned many Milwaukee tools over the years and they've always been great and hard to kill. The problem I have with the 5540 11 amp polisher is the trigger, I got pinched the very first time I used it. Milwaukee decided to save money on this on by not using their signature long trigger. The short trigger has a slight opening at the top and will pinch your finger unless you press it at the bottom. I would of returned the tool if I was using it for production but I'm just using it for polishing my cars."
3,Not as good as expected but is working OK now.,My shop uses it weekly now but had to send it back after a couple of uses for a new switch. Quick and free warranty repair. Not quite as good as the 6 year old Dewalt that got noisey and we still use as a standby.
4,Spooky Ghosts,"Ghosts Don't Eat Potato Chips by Debbie Dade is a mystery book. This is a great kids book that is about four kids in one of the kid's grandmas house. There is a noise in the house that scares the children. The kids try to solve the haunting mystery. I like the book Ghosts Don't Eat Potato Chips because, it's adventurous and fun. But I like mystery book's and if you do you need to read this book.-By Emily in Corning, AR"
1,Ghosts don't eat potato chips By Debbie Dadey,"This book is about Eddie and his friends who have the chore of taking Eddie's great aunt Matilda her meals. They see, and hear many signs that some one other than Matilda is in the house. Is it a thief, a murderer, or a ghost?I did not enjoy the book at all. It was to obvious too me what was going on. But I am sure other younger kids would like it."
4,a review by Wizkid,"I liked this book okay. It wasn't as good as some are, like Leprechauns don't play basketball."
4,boys baptismal outfit! great buy!,Everyone loved this baptismal boys outfit on my son.It looked like he was wearing a little tux. The embroidered crosses on the vest were nicely done. My son is 22lbs and 9 months old so I ordered the 18+ months size. Great fit. I ordered it on a Sunday with expedited shipping and received it on a Wednesday. Our boy was showered with compliments. Everyone wanted to know where we purchased this outfit. The other babies had gowns on. Great buy! Looked in retail stores at mall and couldn't find anything less than $60 and not nearly as detailed. Highly recommend this purchase.
2,Beware of defective goods!,We were sent shorts that were uneven (one side was at least an inch longer than the other). The company does not respond well to emails and expects you to pay return shipping on defective goods. There is no phone number to contact them so you are at their mercy in what is usually a time sensitive matter. The product was shipped fast- just beware if there is a problem with it. The money you think you will save ends up being spent on the shipping.
4,It's more than worth the price!!!,"it's absolutely adorable! and the embroidery on the vest is beautiful. it's nice and not cheap-looking at all. the only reason why i gave it a 4 instead of a 5 star is because (1) i was going to give 4.99, but it's not an option. LOL and (2) when my baby was baptized, it was during the summer. it was hot! and since the item is a polyester, my baby got so uncomfortable in it. he ended up just wearing the vest over his cotton onesie and diaper halfway the mass. but then, again, it's my fault.. i knew it was polyester when i bought it. it's adorable.. i recommend buying it. so worth it! by the way, i had his picture taken 2 weeks before baptism at a professional photo studio. so, it was cooler and he got lots of cute pictures! love love love the outfit."
5,Funny Story - We Laughed So Hard !,"This book was very humorous. Each chapter features a different giant and shows them just being themselves. Unfortunately for the neighboring townsfolks, having the giants so close can be somewhat troublesome when they venture into town. I like the way each subsequent chapter of the book builds on the previous chapter's adventures. My daughter really liked the jokes in one of the chapters. She also liked looking through the colorful illustrations to find the people and things that were mentioned in the story. It was kind of like a Where's Waldo book. This book makes a good 2nd grade reader."
3,Fracas Gift Set,The packaging is huge and arrived in a poor state.Perfume bottle that came as part of the gift set looked used - scratches and marks on the glass bottle.Otherwise fine.
3,Confusing and not as promised,"Warning to all who like to know where in the region the author is talking about - there are no maps! I'm sure many know where the Mongollon Rim exactly is but I don't and my AAA maps were no help. Why can't I get a simple B&W map for cripe's sake? Second warning. The review I read (and the jacket cover) refer to the unsolved mystery of the fate of the Anasazi. Maybe I need a Conclusion Page but the answer wasn't exactly wrapped up in a bow. In fact, I'm not sure the author even concluded on this matter. I bought this because I am traveling to the Four Corners area for a month this year and plan on seeing and camping at several ""Anasazi"" sites. I read all 445 pages but it was a slog at times. It could have been a much better read with maps and especially if the author had ventured the clear cut conclusion that his publisher hyped."
5,Walking the Land,"There is knowledge and substance to be gleaned from the land that can be had no other way than by walking it. And the land Craig Childs walks in this book is some of the most fascinating, particularly if your are bewitched by the ancient Anasazi culture and all that it left beind. His premise of tracking the movement of this culture by tracing its architecture, masonry, pottery, and other indicators as the people moved around and then south presents these prehistoric natives in a way that opened my eyes. The many miles the author spent with feet on the ground makes us all fantasize about doing the same, even though we can't or won't...or don't. There is much to be learned from this book, both about individual human endeavor and the culture that endeavor explores. Highly recommended."
5,Enlightening and Engaging,"This book by Craig Childs is profound, a big word but the book is deserving of it. As an anthropological work it stands head and shoulders above other books that try to explain away the mystery of the Anasazi and the wonder of Chaco Canyon. I couldn't put it down."
2,No mystery,"For Pete's sake. The Anasazi did not vanish without a trace; neither did the Maya. The Booklist reviewer needs to get a clue, maybe read 1491.I am tired of this false mystery being hyped. The Anasazi didn't vanish any more than Rome vanished. I can't take any book seriously that begins with this premise."
5,"If you've surfed before, you'll know...",If you've ever gone out at 5 in the morning to catch a wave before school. Or gone out during lunch break even if it's flat. You'll love this book. Nuff said.
5,great for people who know other editing applications,"I am just finishing up on this book, and after two solid days I have gone from no experience with avid to very comfortable. I don't know how well a new editor would do with this book, but if you already know FCP or Premiere this seems like an excellent way to learn all of the key concepts you need to run an editing app.This is the best instructional manual I have come across."
5,Great for learning,"This is a great book for learning Avid Express Pro. How good? Most software instruction books make no sense if you do not have the software in front of you whilst reading. I orignally did not have access to Avid; but I still could learn from this book. When I finally got access to the software, it was much easier to learn.Unfortunately, Avid has discontinued Express Pro, and replaced it with Media Composer. However, I am now using Media Composer and have not yet found a case where what I learned in this book was not useful."
1,"This application is very poor, full of bugs, and generally..","will make you regret that you bought it. It barely even ran on my Mac in Classic mode, and would not run at all in OS X, athough it states that it is supported.I really can't say enough bad things about this application; even when I did get it running under Classic, the quality of the application was just awful. Horrible unintuitive interfact, poor ""interview"" process, and poor results. It's difficult to use if you can get it to run at all. I will I could return it.They should take this off the market... Do it right or not at all."
1,Willpower sucks,"This is a ridiculously bad program. It's basically a word processor with some blank spaces for personal information, but for some reason it runs reaaalllly slllooowwwwww... I have know idea why. I have a fast computer that can handle video editing and photoshop files with ease and this thing just pokes along. You end up with some gibberish that needs to be corrected, and when you export, it just gives you the first page several times. I wouldn't trust anything that came out of this piece of junk."
1,Won't run in OSX as stated,"I have mac os 10.2.4 on my computer. Willpower will not open. It will run in OS 9, but I'd rather not boot in OS 9 for a program to work that is suppose to work on OS X.The only reason I got it was because it was free after rebate. Not worth doing that."
5,Romance Boleros favoritos,"Excellent selection of Boleros. This is an excellent book for a musician, a singer and also for some one who is not a professional, but has a strong interest in latin music."
5,Sublime Pleasures of Ancestors Roots,"This cd... it's a kind of evocation, a playground for the spirits of our ancestors...this cd is basic."
1,really??,"Product seems fine but I do not trust a company that advertises a 20 rebate by mail, which, after sending in everything required, says that you basically sent them NOTHING and does not even contact you to inform you of this. I do NOT recommend this product to anyone, even my worst enemy. I can only imagine what other suprises await."
1,spysweeper,"I purchased this item and installed it. It detects a Trojancalled Little witch and cleans it but when i reboot the Trojanreappears online or off. Tech support recommended i upgrade to the Ver 2.2 which i did, now i Have Little witch and Spynukerwhich wont go away..Uninstalled and loaded Microtrend they are gone now.."
1,"Poor Product, Poor Support.","After installing this product, I was unable to sign on to any website that required a username and password (including my bank). I went to the Webroot website and submitted the online support form describing the problem. Three days went by without a response, so I submitted their online support form again. I still did not receive a response. I then took the product back to the store for a refund. Due to their extremely poor product support, I will never buy Webroot software again."
1,COMPUTER SLOWED,"I tried this program for about a week and i found that the use of this program drastically slows down even the newest computer. Buy a different program, I use Spybot - Search & Destroy."
1,Beware of WEBROOT software,"To any interested parties - a downloaded copy of WEBROOT SPY SWEEPER has caused constant problems with my machine.I am kept running with outside business interests and don't have time to stay up to date on the latest computer issues. On Jul 22 07 I downloaded Spy Sweeper and within a few weeks began experiencing occasional lock-ups when starting my computer. These gradually increased in frequency and severity until it was necessary to restart my machine 3 or 4 times before it would run. After trying everything I could think of, I uninstalled Webroot Spy Sweeper on Sunday 9/23/07 and BINGO, no further problems.Today I called Webroot customer service to cancel my subscription and ask for a refund and was told very curtly that no refund would be given.(running WindowsXP; 1G ram)"
1,Hard to opt out of automatic renewal,"Do not subscribe to Webroot's automatice payment renewal. I no longer use Spy Sweeper and just received a notice that unless I opt out my subscription will be automatically renewed. I tried to opt out, but need the product code to do so. Of course, I don't have the product code, don't even know if I still own the computer on which Spy Sweeper was installed. I have now had to take the time to write to sales support, and hope that my automatic renewal will be canceled. Even if it is, in is inexcusable that Webroot forced me to go through this trouble. They knew enough about me to send me the email, so they should certainly know enough to cancel my auto renewal without the code."
1,customer support,"I downloaded this from their internet site. Download went as planned but installation failed twice. The error message suggested a corrupted installation file. I e-mailed as directed 2/28/09 and had to re-submit another file as I heard nothing from the ""Support Team"". On 3/15/09 I recieved a list of 5 solutions that had nothing to do with the problem. I have sent another mail...Hmm, By the time we get this figured out it will be time to buy an update. I am unable to call Mon-Fri to get a human."
4,beautiful and sexy!,"I don't think there really is a shoe out there that is sexy with a high heel, and totally comfortable. But these come close! They make even my feet look sexy, and even though the heel is high, it's stable. Great color, great styling, and can't beat the price!"
1,Junk!,"I bought two of these hoping they'd be decent for weekend projects. Unfortunately they're garbage.The roller bearings were seized up on both units out of the box. When they did roll its because the axle rod spinned in the mount and it was very ""herky-jerky"". Also, they don't roll level, they wobble up and down.Very poor quality all around. I'm sending them back."
1,Avoid Shop Fox stand,"I purchased this stand and after attempting to fully assemble it, I advise you to find another stand. The quality of the manufacturer is disgusting. As an example: I had to use my vise to straighten the tabs on the legs of the stand to get them to sit flat against the center shaft. Second, I had to use the vise again to squeeze the leg, which is a ""U"" shaped channel, enough to get the holes for the mounting screws to line up.It's not worth the trouble IT IS JUNK!!!!"
3,Rain Suit or Sauna Swim Suit?,Since summer is almost here the rains have gone so I only had one chance to dawn my new rainsuit and it does the job.However using it in light rain I believe is overkill unles you're trying to shed a few pounds you will sweat profusely so it can double as a Sauna Swim Suit(Anybody remember those from back in the day?).
2,Merchant's return policy,"Ordered this item through Amazon with merchant being ""Go Commando"". Paid $7.00 shipping. Because of my error or other's, received X-Large rather than desired Large. When I inquired Amazon regarding return policy, received email from Go Commando that they would be happy to exchange item but would charge $ 7,00 for shipping. This would make a total of $ 21.00 for shipping, $ 7.00 for original shipping, $ 7.00 to return item to Go Commando, plus $ 7.00 to receive item. I will make do with wrong size. It might be advisable to review the merchant's return policy before ordering although this information was not readily available."
2,Butchered by Penguin,"Get the Loeb edition instead. Penguin is not selling the entire work of Polybius here, but rather the sections that pertain to their ""Rise of the Roman Empire"" theme. If you're looking for any information on the Macedonian successor states of Alexander, look elsewhere, because Penguin cut it out of this edition.The only thing that saves this book from the abyss of the single star is that it is very readable, which is a major compliment for Polybius, who is one of antiquity's drier historians. It also has good appendices and a better index than some other Penguin books. (Tacitus, I'm looking at you.)"
3,"Fragmented, but a decent read","By and large, the reader reviews have hit upon the high (and low) points of this volume. There's a remarkably detailed and readable description of the Second Punic War - the most famous of the three, known for Hannibal, the crossing of the Alps with elephant mounts, and of course the great debacle at Cannae.That said, this volume feels fragmented, split into ways that leave the reader hungering for more. It's certainly passable and worth reading, but beyond a basic historical survey, it can't compete with better works out there."
4,A Mali powerhouse,"Farka Toure and a Mali powerhouse in his own right, is out with AIKBAR - and you'd probably guess Bocoum's roots from the first notes of his Toure-like guitar and vocal blends, rooted in blues and backed by haunting, chant-driven vocals.AIKBAR blends acoustic guitar with traditional violin for maximum impact: his songs are all originals and features his prowess as a songwriter/composer as much as his guitar skills."
1,Not a good choice,"If you are taking the State of Wisconsin Maintenance Mechanic test, this book will not help you. This book has simple examples of mechanical applications at the High School level."
2,Answers are questionable,Good learning book but kinda hard to rely on studying for something when answers in the book are wrong. I have checked numerous sources on some of the questions and have found quite a few wrong answers in there.
3,If this is what it takes for you...,"I bought this book and it is a good guide line. Some people might need this for a good starting point.But really all it comes down is restricting your calorie intake, getting off your hind end and exercising!"
3,Confusion!!,"I just find it very confusing. I've been eating, what I thought, was very healthy for about the past 14 months and the book really contradicts most of what I've been told I was doing right!! Very confusing!"
5,"Good book, good service","The service received was very good. I received all my orders in a short time. The books are very good, and have helped my energy level, and weight. Thank you."
2,What the Food?,"Just want to pile on with this review to what many others have said. Love Eat Right for Your Type, then buy this as a follow on and all of a sudden I have one book that tells me pinto beans are good for me and another that tells me they are poison, both by the same guy. What's up with that? This being the more recent book should explain that to me, but it doesn't. Now I don't know what to eat. Mad."
4,Well planned out,"This book plans out your diet very easily and makes everything very blunt and easy to follow. I personally didn't stick to the diet because I began having bad stomach cramps, probably from such a drastic change, but if you're willing to try it, go for it. I know someone who saw fabulous results from it. So it's worth looking into."
5,Purchased as a gift,"My mother got me interested in the book, so I purchased the little reference book for her carry with her."
5,debz,"This book was recommended to me, but in all honesty, I could not get into it and did not follow it at all...too restrictive."
2,Too many discrepancies,"I purchased this book fully intending to try this program; I also got a copy of the cookbook to accompany the program. For each blood type, they list foods as ""Highly Beneficial"" (food that acts like a medicine); ""Neutral"" (food that acts like a food); and ""Avoid"" (food that acts like a poison). What I discovered, however, was that there were numerous discrepancies in the food lists between the cookbook and the Food and Beverage (FB) list. Just two examples; for my blood type, the FB list shows cucumbers as a food to ""Avoid""; while in the cookbook, it is listed as ""Neutral"". Pinto beans in the FB list are listed as ""Avoid"" while in the cookbook they are actually listed as ""Highly Beneficial"". The discrepancy is from one extreme to the other. These are just two discrepancies - how is one supposed to determine which one is right and begs to question how reliable the rest of the information in the book may be."
4,Good Companion Volume,"Not a bad reference to have if you read the book. This is okay to carry with you when shopping and refer to. However I found it far more bulky than I needed.When I read the original volume, I made lists (spreadsheets) for Beneficial, Neutral, and Avoid foods. After reviewing this volume (and finding a couple discrepencies) I then just clarified the Beneficial and Avoid lists.Really these are the only lists you need. You need to know the foods to actively seek out (Beneficial) and the foods to Avoid for your blood type. Neutral foods are anything that is left.I like the Blood Type program, and think that this volume could be condensed to a few laminated printed cards that could be kept in the car and used for shopping. Since those are not available, this is the next best thing.The Blood Type program does work. Being an O, it confirmed my experience with Atkins that focusing on the foods natural to your blood type will help you lose weight and make you feel great."
3,"Blood Type O Food, Beverage and Supplemental Lists","This is a pocket size book. Easy to carry around, helps you check your food choices are acceptable for your blood type."
1,Not an accurate supplement!,"Although I swear by the blood type diet for help with my food allergies, I was hoping that I could have a little book to carry along with me instead of the big book when shopping. However, this book seems to have inaccurate lists. I don't know why, but it is not true to the the blood type diet as it was given in the original book."
2,Nothing new from the book,"The book ""Eating right for you Type"" has the same info in it with the exception that this newer book has some major discrepencies from the orginal book on several of the foods that are benneficial and foods that are to be avoided. Save your money there is nothing new in this book!"
4,Answers many questions!,"Being type o and attributing my digestive problems to being gluten intolerant , this information confirmed and expanded my knowledge and helped me understand WHY I react as I do to certain foods and why I invariably feel poorly and end up I'll when trying to eat began only. Thank you for helping this make sense for me!"
1,book,All this information is included in the Eat Right for Your Type book. So I really didn't need to buy it.
4,"Type O Food,",Was a revealing book. Had not known about the subject in detail previously. Interesting. Will implement suggestions.
4,Eating right for O blood type.,"I like the content and size of this book. I can slip it into my purse. It is well organized. However, being unfamiliar with the content/lists, I frequently need to check a category for foods that are good and ones to avoid, either while shopping or planning meals at home. There are many different sections to reference. I actually made and tapped on colored, labled tabs for each section for easier use. I have used the book so much that they are wearing out already. For the future, I would love to have this book on sturdier paper and the sections separated for quick use, in some way."
3,"blood type o food , bev, supplemental list",Great to take on trips or just out to eat. It is also useful for those days your not feeling yourself and you need some remedies.
1,Don't waste your money on this book,Don't waste your money on this book. It is all covered in the first book eat right for your blood type. I was expecting more foods on the lists and got nothing.
1,Shipping took almost a month,"During the time of this purchase, seller indicated 'usual' shipping is within 3-5 business days. Status of this item showed 'in stock' as well. I did not receive the book until almost a month from the time of order placement. Not to mention, they took the money out of my acct right away....great service in the name of bad customer service!!!!"
4,Quickly Delivered,I bought this for my boyfriend who is out of the country for a few months. He has shared it with several co-workers. It is full of helpful tips for this blood type. Easy to read and easy to reference.
4,A good one,"This is a useable, concise, quick start information guide. It was easy reading and I was able to start using the information immediately. I did have to check to see what a few of the supplements were, but overall I was especially pleased with this book. Exactly what I was looking for."
4,Save time and money,If you buy this book you really don't need to buy the main book. This gives all the information a Type O person needs.
2,Pass this one by,"Jayne Ann Krentz is one of my very favorite authors, but this book from her early years was terrible. I disliked the male protagonist and the female lead was annoying. I couldn't identify with either one. Early in the book, Court nearly rapes Leya because he `wants her so much.' He's over bearing, arrogant and pushy the entire book.In her `Dear Reader,' JAK tells us at the start of her career she wrote classic, battle-of-the-sexes style romances. This book originally was written under her pen name Stephanie James. I've read several of her books under that name and, although several are okay to good, this book didn't even make it to fair.The only reason I gave it a 2 was because I did finish it--I kept hoping it would get better. It didn't. If you want to read an early JAK, try Between the Lines or one of her others."
2,Not Loving it!,"I love just about everything JAK writes, but this book was so lame I had to flog myself to finish it! Zero suspence, no mystery whatsoever, barely even any racey parts. The charactors were not well developed and certainly not very interesting, but heck even bad JAK is better than most other authors."
1,Very Disaappointing,"I found this book, just doesn't make sense. There is no story, just unreasonable fighting between the two main characters. I couldn't figure out the attaction and there was no outside action such as them working together to save a company, or anything. Generally Jayne Ann Krantz books excell in having a feisty heroine that is trying to solve something or make a difference and then having the hero help. This book is just about constant seduction that never really happens. I couldn't even finish it."
1,Really?,I didn't even get past the beach on this one. I absolutely refuse to read what amounts to a rape scene as love making. Krentz totally disappointed me on this one.
4,its worth getting,"This air conditioner is very good. I have read reviews before on how loud it is, but thats not so true. I have a large bedroom and its perfect.It lets out cold air and has good strength. I'm gald i purchased it. I would definetly recommend this air conditioner to anyone!!!!"
4,pleased,"Bought the unit a week ago at an estate garage sale for 25$. It was originaly purchased at Amazon. It immediately replaced a 9K BTU. Then our heat wave hit. We are lucky ducks that I went to that garage sale! Yep, it's loud. But exactly what we wanted - big, powerfull, all the gadgets, 110 and not 220, and will blow you away if you stand in front of it. I do not know if it has a dehumidfier as most units today do not. I read the book and it does not specify that NOR do I care. I see no condensed water dripping out of the back. Nevertheless, it cools a sun parlor, living room, and dining room. Approximately 800 sf. It is my hero as I removed one other unit and let it handle the entire job. I highly recommend this unit to folks in the NE USA."
3,Serviceable A/C,"A/C is just ""OK"". Doesn't wow me. I was thinking 12,000 BTU's would be more powerful but my 6500 BTU A/C was almost comperable in cooling the same space. However, the price was right and the size is great! A/C's of 10K BTU or higher used to require in wall mounting or a really wide window. This A/C has more height than width which allows it to fit in any window. 3 Stars for middle of the road A/C. Worth the buy but don't expect a meat locker."
3,Decent unit,We're generally satisfied with this AC unit. We live in an NYC apartment and this is for our living room (with hopefully some spillover coolness to make the entryway and kitchen passable).Our living room is 16 x 12 feet with 8 1/2 foot ceilings. The unit does cool it down but we don't think it has the cooling power of the older unit we used to have. It is a little louder than you'd like but that's true of most of them still.Still heavy (though less so than our old unit). Had to have our super correctly install it with the legal NYC supports required. Overall no major complaints and would generally recommend it so far - we just bought this summer of 2010 so can't speak to longevity.
1,fridgdare air conditioner,"i had to wait an extra amount of time on this ac because it was being shipped from a private dealer. when ac was inserted into window, the noise resembled a lawn mower. upon examination, the ac had dents and scratches all over it. ac was definatly not in working condition and i had to return to Amazon and replaced it with a different brand."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"I bought this box set because of all the major Brazilian stars featured in the set. I have a pretty extensive Brazilian collection, and I hoped this would fill in for some stars that I do not have in my collection. But it was not what I hoped for, the stars are there but they are not singing any of their good stuff, and many of the tracks feature multiple singers, like if they were singing for a fund raiser. The few good tunes that are in this collection don't justify the price."
4,Minolta Dimage X Casual Digital Camera Case,This Bag is as cute as the camera- Its small and will do a nice job of protecting it from the elements and any banging about. It lacks any additional room for extra battery or memory storage cards. It also has a belt loop for a fanny pack or regular belt. A longer handle for over the neck or shoulder would be nicer. Additional space would be nice too. The actual cameras wrist strap can hang out side and then be used as well.
3,It's OK gets the job done but...,It's not exactly a perfect fit. The lid on the case uses velcro to secure the content. But the fit between the lid and the case is awkward. The case is well padded which is good for the camera's protection. On the other hand this is not a case which will slip into any pocket unlike the camera itself. It's a great item if plan on carrying on your belt.
2,Not the case pictured,"I bought this case in fall 2003. When I lost it, I ordered another. The version they sent has a metal snap that always pops loose instead of the wide velcro strip. The case they sent has a plastic and metal snap hook that I had to cut off when I got it.Not what I ordered Adorama!"
5,Love it,I hit a deer several years ago with my wife's car. I've had these installed on every car since and you can actually see them stop and turn their head when you have it turned on. Haven't hit one since.
4,Elected County and Town Official,"In deer country, these things really help alert the deer and allow for reaction time. Have had them on both vehicles and my previous pick-up. Great safety feature when you have to travel at differnt times almost daily in rural upstate NY."
5,Nice unit,"Installed this on our 2012 Mustang and it's a great unit. No trouble to hear it and I hope the moose will hear it to. Easy install, quality product."
4,Deer Alert,"We received two of these as ordered.However, we have not installed them yet on the vehicles.(The instructions for installation are not as simple as expected.)"
3,Really LOUD,"I have only had the alert on my car for a couple of days,so don't know if it is causing the deer to avoid me, but it would cause most anything to leave the vicinity...this thing is LOUD!!!! If you install it, by no means should it be set up to be activated when the engine is turned on..use the switch or headlight option.(You would not want to be sitting at a stoplight in town with this thing screaming...) It is a bit annoying even inside the car--you have to turn the radio up. However, I drive deer-infested roads and am willing to put up with most anything if it will keep these ""rats with antlers"" off my windshield!!"
4,Deer warning signal.,Loud to the human ear inside vehicle. Maybe the deer will move whenhearing this noise. I usually cut them off while at stop lights orintersections.
4,Installed on my motorcycle,"I live in the Poconos, lots of deer. I had it installed on my motorcycle by the dealer. I can certainly hear it beeping while I ride(my muffler actually works, so my bike is relatively quiet) but the sound is quite tolerable on the open road. You simply ignore it after a while & I can still enjoy the radio. I turn it off in town, not many deer there."
1,Not great,"Bought this transfer board thinking it would provide a little extra length for transferring from the wheelchair to the car. While it's longer than the wood board we have now, it's just not rigid enough to provide a safe and comfortable transfer. Even when the actual transfer distance is only 8"", the board sags down into the transfer space instead of giving a straight and strong bridge, thus making it more difficult for my husband to pull himself across the transfer space (he has to pull himself uphill to get out of the sag). I would not recommend this board for an active, double-leg amputee. Instead, find yourself a strong, rigid wooden transfer board that doesn't sag."
4,Leo Page-A-Day Horoscope Calendar 2002,I recently purchased this book and have read the whole thing already. It had some very interesting days and events. If you are into horoscopes you will love this book. It has your days already set out and you know what to expect. It is truly a joy to read! It is like having a psychic in living with you.
5,The Best,No doubt the best walker I have ever had. Excellent quality worknanship and price The double wheels really make a big difference. .
1,Not Accurate!,"All of these thermometers are reading something different. When we are doing experiments it is important that they are reading correctly. No, they do not have mercury but the whole point was to be able to use them effectively. No, I would not buy these!"
4,Frigidaire Dehumidifier,"This has been an excellent unit that works as advertised. My experience with Brand ""S"" was very unsatisfactory when I returned 5 units in 7 month. The FDL60P1 is perfect for my basement workshop that I need to keep at 50% humidity as it is quiet and very efficient. The only reason I didn't rate it at 5 stars is I would like to see this kind of performance over a reasonable period of time."
4,Nice unit,"Amazon impressed me with their shipping of the first unit - it arrived the next day (this was with their free service, to boot). Unfortunately, it lost one of its wheels in transit, and it would not power up.The second unit arrived the next day (it took longer to arrange shipping back for the defective unit).When its cooler (55), it seems that it takes longer for the unit to suck water out of the air. But when the basement heats up to 65, it sucks like nothing has sucked before.Well, it sucks water out of the air a lot faster than our old unit did. Its realtively quiet, and the water bucket has a decent capacity. The RH reading is a nice feature, as is the water level guage."
2,Won't run after a power outage,The dehumidifier works OK but must be manually reset after a power interruption making unattended operation impossible. Not good when you're trying to dehumidify your basement while you're on vacation in the summer!
1,Outrageous,"The delivery was prompt, unit was in good condition. However it would not resume operating after the water bin had been emptied. Also it was impossible to understand the directionbs to hook it up to a gravity output line. I wrote to the company twice, no answers. I called their help line and went around and around pushing buttons looking for someone to talk to. I never found one. Finally I was given a repair number to call by an automated voice. I called that number and was told that a service call was $150. No thanks. I returned the unit. I will never, ever buy a Frigidaire product again, they just don't seem to care about customer service."
4,Frigidaire FDL60P1 Pint Dehumidifier,"I have had a dehumidifier which I bought from Home Depot for the last 4 years whose function was just so-so.This Frigidaire Dehumidifier is better but more finicky.I have had trouble first placing then keeping the plastic tube used for draining the dehumidifier on the nozzle in the back of the machine that is used for draining the collected water into a drain.Still, I really like the fact that a hygrometer is included as part of the machines mechanism and it functions much better than my previous machine.It is in my basement so noise is not an issue.The big issue why I did not give a 5 and gave a four star rating is that if the machine is jostled it somehow seems to affect the functioning and the machine goes into rest mode."
1,Good for 3 years and then SHOT!,Plugged this unit in earlier this spring and fan runs but no water in the water bucket. Really pissed. Warranty is still in effect but I paid about $150 for this unit and a service call and parts will be about the same as a new unit. What to do? I will never buy Frigidaire again!
1,Disappointed... to say the least!,"I purchased this product a couple of weeks ago and it arrived shortly thereafter; moreover, I purchased the dehumidifier based on the high ratings given by those who had the product in their homes. This dehumidifier is not up to the task (as compared to two other competitor models I've owned over the course of the several years). I thought I would try a new brand name... only to learn that I should've stuck with what worked well. It dehumidifies to a very slight degree... but not nearly as much as claimed. It also has a digital humidity display which, based on the rate of dehumidiciation, in my personal experience and opinion, would take probably close to ""a year"" before getting to the desired level. I'm returning this product to purchase something that works effectively."
1,It Didn't Work,"I ordered the dehumidifier from Amazon based on the reviews. It arrived in only 3/4 of the packing box. The installation instructions were confusing, so I called the manufacturer for clarification. The manufacturer's customer service rep was also unable to install the machine based on the instructions. Once we figured out how to install it, the dehumidifier leaked. I sent it back to Amazon for an exchange. The replacement is several days overdue and appears to be lost in Amazon's paperwork. I give both the machine and Amazon zero stars on this purchase."
2,Gets air dry well,"Seems to keep air at 40 percent humidity in constant mode, which is nice. For me, the packaging looks poor, it is a box with no bottom and light padding, you cut the straps and lift off the box. One of the cheap Wheels was broken off in transit. When the red light goes on for full tank, the red light will not go off even when an empty tank is replaced back in. I have to whack the side of the unit with my hand to get the unit to run again...stuck switch? I don't know. I would not buy it again."
2,generates too much heat,i purchased this humidifier hoping it would dry out the air in my basement. but the unit generated so much heat that the air seemed even heavier/hotter. i would not recommend this unit to anyone. seems like a portable air conditioner would work so much better.
5,Great product,"I really like this dehumidifier, and would buy the same model again. I've been using it for about a month with no problems. I set it up in our very damp and slightly moldy basement which is about 1600 sf. Initially, I used the collection tray to see fast it would fill. It only took a few hours to fill, and I had to dump the water 2 - 3 times per day. I was really impressed at how quickly I felt a difference in the air of the basement.I set up the drain tube with hose, which was actually very easy to do, though I needed plumbing tape to make a good seal between the drain tube connector and the hose. It's been running automatically ever since.I can hear it when I listen for it, but otherwise am not bothered at all by the noise."
4,Almost perfect,"I would have given this humidifier 5 stars except the one I have has a problem. If I wait until the light goes on that indicates that the tank is filled, I empty the tank, slip into back into the dehumidifier and the unit starts right up. If I empty the tank before it is full (the light is not on) I must unplug and then replug the humidifier (I assume to reset it) for it to go on after I reinsert the tank. I would definitely buy it again, though, even with this annoyance as it works great. I would recommend it for a basement but not for a living area since it is large and somewhat noisy.Follow-up: I spoke with a representative of the manufacturer. All of these units when emptied before the reservoir is full will need to be reset by unplugging and then replugging. I still would buy the unit again. It works extremely well and I like the humidity indicator."
1,Help with Breathing problem,"I ordered this from amazon.com because of a breathing problem that I have and the humidity is getting real bad here. When it arrived it was obvious that it was one that had already been returned to Amazon.con's once. there were broken parts, lables that had been removed and then put back on had dirt on them. the box did not even have a bottom the packing material had just been banded together. I now have it on my porch with the box wired together, since tape would not hold the 40 lbs that this thing weighs. And I have to wait 2 or 3 weeks to get my money back so that I can buy something else. All the while needing it for medical reasons. Amazon screwed me big time."
3,do not worry,"I have been one week since I wear it, but all material it's really bad inside is cut one finger and between fingers outside, too. Raincover doesn't work, just protect a little.Finally seller offered me a new pair."
4,Good deal.,Gloves fit well and are warm enough for most of the year. Probably will need liners for winter use.
5,Nice and warm,Great gloves got them for my bike ended up going to Boston and wore them everyday nice and warm comfortable fit.
2,"Horrible construction, falling apart","Nice that they include rain covers in the zippered pockets, but otherwise these gloves are crap. One month after I got mine a seam started tearing in the right glove. Now, 6(?) months later, the leather is just falling apart on both gloves. Save your money and buy something else."
1,Size issues,"Everything I have ordered from Jafrum has been way too small. I ordered the largest size available. I had to give them to my son, since I couldn't get my hands in them"
2,motorcycle gloves sized very small.,"This glove is worth the money, except they were too small. I ordered 3xxx large, and could barely get my hand in them. Shipping was prompt."
5,The best bottled lemon juice,"I have tried other lemon juice brands and Sicilia is the ONLY bottled lemon juice I have ever found that actually tastes like real lemons, and that includes Real Lemon lemon juice, which in my opinion does NOT taste like lemons. I can use this on fish as if it were an actual lemon and not tell the difference."
3,OK...,"I had to buy this for a class and read excerpts. It's decent, and puts forth some notable theories in the essays it contains, but it's hardly interesting reading. Also, it's somewhat dated, having been compiled in the 70s. Worthwhile for women's and gender academics, but not a page-turner--look elsewhere for modern takes on gender."
1,Don't buy junk,"I used to be a satisfied customer of Milwaukee saws. That has changed. I have bought 2 of these saws recently. The first one, the switch went out within 30 days, so I took it in for repair and I broke out the second saw. I used it for 2 days when the bearings went out, so I took that one in for repair, picked up the first saw used it for about a week when the bearings went out in that one.I'm done. I've already replaced both saws with the same size from Dewalt and have had no problems whatsoever.I'll never buy another Milwaukee item.Thank you for allowing me to bend your ear and I hope this has helped"
1,not that good,"I thought the amulet would be of better quality, if you are into magick, instead of paraphernalia, this is not for you"
5,Utterly charming...read the whole series if you can!,"As a young American Studies major, I read _English Creek_ , the second book about the McCaskill family, for a class about the American West. I was enchanted. Then I read the first, _Dancing at the Rascal Fair_ (the first in the series) which enchanted me again. Close to ten years after I read my first Doig book, _Ride with Me, Mariah Montana_ yet again entertained and beguiled me. Doig is a gift to us readers.There is not a single dud in this series. Even if you don't like ""western"" novels (and I usually do not), these are great reads with excellant characters."
2,not good Doig,"I love Ivan Doig. This is the only Doig that I don't recommend. As one of my relatives said, he must have had a brain lapse and tried to go commercial. What a loser book."
1,Nothing but a travelogue,"This book was a great disappointment after Dancing at the Rascal Fair. Ride with Me was nothing but an excuse for Doig to make a little money from all he knows about Montana, a state whose geography holds no interest for me. The characters were unpleasant, and the plot was thin. The old man is nasty and cantankerous without justification. The lovers end up exactly where they began, so all that happens between them during the novel cancels out. The hours the characters spent driving around in that truck brought back many painful memories of the boring vacations my sister and I were forced to take with our parents to see the country. Dull, dull, dull! I'd have given this a minus score if that were a possibility. Zero is too good for it."
5,Great information and tips - a good read.,"I bought this book and not only found many useful tips and practice exercises but enjoyed reading it as well. I particularly liked the ""wheel of life"" exercise, it really helps focus on the importance of being balanced and well-rounded. It can also help pinpoint the areas in your life where you might need more focus. I even used this book as a topic for a meeting at work and shared some of it with my coworkers."
1,Overpriced Pamphlet,"I could not believe this book when I received it. I don't recall the number of pages, but this book is thin enough to jimmy open a door. The content of the book may by OK, but I have to rate this book with 1 star, as I feel very ripped off. I would recommend one of the many other Chanukah books on Amazon."
5,Somethin Bout Love,Another out the ball park hit from Brian Culbertson! If you are a Smooth Jazz fan this CD is it.
5,"M. Gibbon ""book maven""",it was very nice. Not at all what i thought it would be. He's very talent. I would purchase more of his music.
3,Something of a let down,"Some reviews on here are so longgg on here its like reading a book, but i will not bore you in the slightest. The first cd i bought from Brian Culbertson was Nice n Slow, good album and the 2nd It's on Tonight great album, since then i have got 2 more After Hours and Come on up, now onto my latest aquasition Somethin' Bout Love , which in my opinion is a definate step back from the Fantastic cd After Hours from 1996 [ all instrumentals] so why oh why Brian did we need all the collabrations which are basically Soul, sorry but i don't get it ? or was it it seemed like as good idea at the time ummm bad idea me thinks , a let-down Brian, looking forward to your next studio album whenever that may be."
5,Truly awesome!!!,"I've heard Culbertson on the radio before but never owened a CD until i got ""Bout Love"". The album is truly spectacular(im biased to Keyboards), and am gonna' get his previous albums for sure. Gotta check out the cut ""Do you really love me?"" for a serious jazz jammin...."
5,His best album yet.,This album is great. The production is lush and the songs are well written. Hats off to Mr. Culbertson.
5,A CD To Have,This is the first cd I own of Brian Culbertson and it's a nice jazz cd. I highly recommend this as part of a jazz collection.
2,Steel bar is junk,"I really, really like these things, but they just do not last. Every single time you engage the clamp, the ""chips"" make a little ding in the surprisingly soft steel rod underneath. With repeated usage, you'll have a vast collection of these little dings all along the clamping bar in a matter of days, making it virtually impossible to slide the jaw/finger grip around without a great deal of force. This tends to make using this clamp a great deal more trouble than it's worth.I also don't like the way the finger grip prevents you from sliding an average sized carpenter's square flush against the far end to check your alignment."
3,"Works OK, but has limitations...","As long as you do not bear up against the edge, this guide lets you cut straight, but as I discovered cutting the bottoms off of two bathroom cabinets, if you bear against the edge with even moderate effort, the guide bows away from the line of cut, and you have damaged your workpiece.I compensated by increasing my cutting speed, and pushing the guide towards the tool with the thumb of the hand that wasn't gripping the tool (a cordless circular saw).So it will work OK if you can work around it's inherent lack of rigidity. Or buy a thicker, wider guide. I may get one soon myself, as I can see myself forgetting to do the thumb-pushing trick under a heavy workload."
2,marginally useful,"Not horrid but without theAll in One Clamp #WJ Wide Jaws Fixture for All in One Clamp (2-Pack)for another $17 per clamp, the clamp faces are too narrow to make contact with anything but flat boards. The T track is of no use as its a peculiar size so they get to sell more accessories. They do work OK as a straight edge but not nearly as good as the Bora 540950 50 Inch Aluminum Guide Clamp Edge, they make a bunch of sizes. I thought I was getting a good deal from Rockler on a blow out of a set of 24"", 36"" and 50"". Turns out to not be a good deal after all. I see now why they are getting rid of them cheap.BTW I thought that the marking tape was a good idea--NOT! It is hard to align accurately and even that is dubious. Maybe OK for rough framing but not otherwise."
5,Awesome,this book was amazing it took many unexpexcted twists and turns till the end. i cant wait for the next book to come out!****** :*
4,Perhaps the best introduction to jazz,"I spent most of my liesure time & all of my discretionary funds for about 20 years trying to hear as much of jazz history as possible. I hosted a public radio jazz program for 18 of those years. I bought a copy of this book to lend to friends who ask me how to begin learning about jazz. It walks thru all the instruments & all the styles, & describes a fine initial library of CDs.One small caveat: Fordham is British & has a slightly higher opinion of British jazz in general than American critics have. I love John Surman & Mike Westbrook & Tony Oxley & their fellows, but I automatically deduct half a star (figuratively speaking) from Fordham's reviews of his countrymen."
5,All around jazz!,"This is a colorful, almost frenetically designed overview which touches on all aspects of jazz from its history to an anatomy of individual instruments and a discussion of techniques.Of particular interest are the short biographies of 20 jazz greats and a discography. Among those profiled are Billie Holliday, Dizzy Gillespie, Sonny Rollins and John Coltrane. Each bio includes a performance photo of the artist and a box showing key recordings, musical partners and styles. The discography is arranged by musical style from early singers to swing, bebop, modal jazz and fusion.An excellent introduction and reference."
5,Jason goes to cd,"One cannot help but associate the music of Harry Manfredini with the date that everyone loves to fear. Friday the 13th. I love this soundtrack, while the film is not my favorite in the series...I am still a fan of all the Friday films and this music is a must have for all of us who dare to venture to Camp Crystal Lake. Get this rare hard to find gem now."
4,nice hat,"Nice hat, but size was a bit smaller than expected. Quick delivery and good quality. Good price. Might want to go up a size."
3,Doesn't fit,"The size is not correct. I have a small head and have bought 6 & 3/4 fitted hats before that are perfect for me. This hat was not one of them. The size seems slightly bigger, around 6 7/8. Doesn't seem like a lot but it is and it makes a difference."
3,Campy B-Movie Fun,"This book is about large green caterpillars that eat people. They transform into large, malevolent moths that spray acid into peoples' faces. A lot of fun, if you want a lot of gore and grue."
1,Did Not Work with Base,"Caution - the extension rails I received from Amazon were NOT the correct match for the updated FOX base - had to call FOX, and eventually buy the rails, at a much higher price, through Grizzly. A real disconnect by Amazon - unusual in my dealings with Amazon - and hopefully already fixed by Amazon."
1,Don't waste your money ...,"I bought the G7315 mobile base and needed the extra width offered with these extension bars. Not only are they incredibly thin-walled (~0.090"") but they do not even mate to the corner brackets properly. There is a lot of slop all around which for something sold to support up to 1200# is surprising, if not disconcerting. That is another thing - everything about the mobile base for which these bars were made screams ""cheap, cheap, cheap"" except the price. Forty smackers will buy a lot of oak - if you are a woodworker buy the oak and make your own extensions, you'll be glad you did."
5,Very Funny Indie Film,"I have watched most of Chris Seaver's Low Budget Pictures and this is one of his funniest. I laughed out loud at least a dozen times and look forward to watching it again. Typically in these LBP (Low Budget Pictures) you get 1 or 2 actors doing a great job and the rest are painful to watch. In this case everyone was excellent and played their parts very well. Also, some LBP movies are funny in parts but drag/get repetitive in other areas....this one was funny from start to finish. Highly recommended for a few good laughs with your buddies!"
1,BAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I actually watched this movie, until I could not take it any more. I am a big fan of indy budget horror, and trust me this is the worst FILM ever made. They have no talent, they look like dropouts from a school full of losers. I can't believe anyone would follow this CRAP. I REPEAT this is the worst movie ever made. NO script, not funny, directing non existent. Anyone who watches this drivel is either below the age of 21 and has no brain cells left in their brain. Or an IQ of a rock!!! STAY VERY FAR AWAY!!"
2,Not so Quick & Easy,"This product does OK when you are designing & developing your resume but the conversion process to a MS Word or PDF file is very poor (Something you have to do if you want your resume read by potential employers). Specific problems I had were noticable changes in format, lost bullets, lost lines, and overlapping words. I was able to correct most of the changes in WS Word but not in PDF. However, I found the whole process an inconvenience... thus returned the product within 24 hrs."
1,Think Twice,"Just a warning to other parents. We purchased this item and found it to be very unsafe. There is no way to lock the strap. Once it is tightened in place, all that is needed to untighten it is to pull on it, meaning the furniture could easily still topple over. Also, the sewn end of the strap pulled apart and came off from the bracket during its first use. I'm just glad this didn't happen after we had installed it. I would highly recommend looking for another product."
3,Does the job if the plastic doesn't snap,"These have several screws in them, but all rely on flimsy seeming plastic that would render the product useless if it snaps (it hasn't). Because of this my husband refuses to use them. Better to get some L brackets at the hardware store for a fraction of the cost."
1,Max and Ruby's Midas Misses the Point,"Up until now I thought I liked all of Rosemary Wells' stories... but Midas is simply awful. Not only is some of the artwork gruesome, but the story fails to deliver anything close to the original message of how gold (or make-substitution-here) is not the end-all of life.In Well's version, Ruby tells her little brother about an 'ancient' Max (Midas), who instead of turning everything into gold with a touch, turns everyone into dessert with his laser eyes. Mom is zapped. Dad is zapped, and there is no sign of regret until sister is changed into a slice of cake. Then, without explanation, there is a sudden change of heart. (I guess one can only conclude that it was okay to zap mom and dad but not sis.)The text is not the only problem though. The pictures of Max and his blood-red eyes are strange. Supposedly laser light, the emanations stream down in arches, not in straight lines. It looks more like Max is leaking blood from his eyes. Yeech.Can't recommend it."
1,Complete Calendar Kit,I was very disappointed in this software. The box does not give much information so I thought it was something similar to Calendar Creator which I also have but do not like its buginess.Data Becker's website is also very limited in its information about the product. It does make calendars (not the kind I need)but it is not very intuitive and makes what should be simple chores difficult.I mentioned this to my brother via email and he said he's always had problems with Data Becker software. I wish I knew that before I bought this thing.
4,This book is wonderful,"It's great... includes useful information, including how to draw pentagons and hexagons."
2,What a tough biology class!!!,"I used this book for a biology course I took in college. Man, what a tough course!! The teacher was nice, but she sure made the tests tough! This book, while having nice pictures and illustrations, is fairly difficult to follow as well. Maybe if I had used the included cd the class would have been easier. I am glad to be done!!"
4,"Lights Out, Volume 7","This DVD has some nice episodes from early television. The programs are not restored or of the quality of later television, but if you are a fan of the old radio shows or the later ""Twilight Zone"" or ""Outer Limits"" you may be interested in this DVD and the early television series it provides samples of."
5,Able Nightroad knocks your socks,"I normally don't like vampires. Pretty much at all, but I loved this series, and how inventive it was overall. I highly suggest it."
5,idiot reviewers,"i disagree with the formal review above.this is a fine anime,well made and visually stunning. the story is not terribly depressing but the characters are well done. no gratuitous violence and a nice message.what more could you want. don't knock the vampire fans . we are out here waiting."
1,If you like close-ups you'll love this.,"This is hands down one of the worst anime series I have ever seen. To give you a basis for this my favorite anime titles are Fullmetal Alchemist, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Afro Samurai, Karas, Samurai Champloo, Scrapped Princess, and Burst Angel. The series seems to be a series of detached segmented episodes with little overlap and my god the close-ups are horrible not to mention the terrible sappy music that starts playing leaving one thinking: Why are they trying to make this so damned dramatic? Also great idea here but I wanted to see WAY MORE Vampires and way less Vatican Political B.S. Skip this series and save yourself hours."
2,Extremely mediocre,"Ok, I watch a lot of anime and I must say that I had very high hopes for this and was sorely disappointed, even though the animation was really good the characters were lackluster, even the main character wasn't given enough background story even though they eluded to a very dramatic past. a few of the episodes were not bad, actually I would say that the meat of the series lies in about 12 episodes but 50% isn't enough for me to re-watch what was bad storytelling style, bad characters, and bad battle scenes. I won't spoil anything but THE END SUCKED!! HARD honestly might be the worst ending in anime history, they lead up to a big battle scene that goes into outer space where it continues then the character shows up a day later after the battle , doesn't show but about 4 hits in the fight. Save you money and move on to the next anime."
4,I love this anime!,"This is a great anime, although at times the story arcs feel a bit rushed, the process of watching this show is enjoyable. The characters are likeable and the animation is very cool.My only disappointment with the series was the rushed ending... there seemed to be some pretty significant build up and one would have expected it to be a pivotal moment, but it was over and done with when it felt like it should have just begun.Despite that, I hold this series close to my heart and recommend it to fans of vampires and Gothic looking anime."
5,Trinity Blood:Complete box set,"I think this is one of my favorite anime flix out there.It has a realy cool set up pitting vampires against the church that operate as goverments.I liked the characters that they present in the story,very interesting.A must see for all anime fans."
2,Slooooooow!,"The story is complex and somewhat interesting, if you can keep yourself awake! The pacing of events is really slow and the ending is painfully open and unclimactic!"
2,Good but not good enough!,"This book does only provide some basic understanding of Na, K, and acid base pathophysiology and replacement. Other e-lytes such as magnesium, calcium, phosphor and especially the interaction of those is missing. The acid base part is ok for a basic understanding of the material.Overall there are much better options to spend your money on."
2,I've tried! Oh! How I've tried to like it.,"Go to Guyton for clearer and complete understanding. This is the 2nd edition of Acid-Base Ridiculously Simple I've purchased and it just isn't for me.I want to begin again at the basics and Guyton's Textbook of Medical Physiology is the best way to go. Longer, yes. More understanding for me? Yes."
4,Good for the basics...,"Not a bad book for the basics. It will get you by, but it does not replace a good physiology text."
4,"Good, sound advice for the average American family.","I heard about this book from a friend a couple of years ago but just got around to reading it. I truly wish I had read it back then - I'd probably be debt free by now. Debt free in America? What a concept! Ramsey makes the reader realize that we live in a ""gotta have now"" world and that by using credit to get it, we end up spending way too much money for even simple things like food (i.e. eating out compliments of a gold card at 21% interest) and everything we think we own is really owned by a bank or finance company. Scary ideas at first, but very comforting once you buy into the concept of debt-free through discipline."
2,Just get the planner,"The ""Financial Peace Planner"" is a soft-cover version with more interactive options (lists, graphs, do-it-yourself charts) than the hardback. If you like the Financial Peace series, just get the planner to get the full usage from the teachings."
5,This book has greatly helped us financially.,"This is a ""must read"" book to those who want to be debt free and pave a solid foundation for the future.Its easy to read and understand.Dave Ramsey's advice has honestly helped us in achieving our financial goals."
5,A MUST HAVE FOR ANYONE BEGINNING A NEW STAGE IN LIFE,"While this book is geared more towards the home owning 2.5 kids working family, I found it to have a dramatic impact on my newlywed, apt renting, DINK family. Dave actually puts into words what we all know we should do. He also lays out a plan that leaves room for personal adaptation. This book is a must-have for newlyweds, recent graduates, or in-debt families. I close by saying that this book has motivated me not to let debt overtake my family-EVER."
5,CHANGED MY LIFE FOREVER!,"We applied the principles outlined in Dave's book and got out of $14,000 worth of debt in only 9 months. Dave Ramsey and this book have forever changed our lives for the better. We are debt free and on our way to retiring with more money than we ever dreamed possible. ANYONE can read this book and get out of debt AND STAY OUT OF DEBT! I can't say enough good things about Dave Ramsey and the book Financial Peace."
5,Great Book!,"We started Dave Ramsey over a decade ago. It's a great book and plan, if you can't do it all, it's a great reference and starting place for those who are looking for a little financial help."
3,Financial Peace Review,"Overall, the book was somewhat helpful. Although the techniqes recommended are fairly basic and common-sense, it was motivating and does provide some helpful forms at the end for putting a savings plan into action. I found one portion of the book addressing whether your family needs two incomes to be a bit sexist. The entire section was written in terms of whether ""she"" needs to work, whereas the remainder of the book is written in terms of ""he,"" the assumption being that the man is the main breadwinner."
1,Just Like An Ostrich,"We as consumers neglect our financial obligations for immediate satisfaction. In doing so, we create for ourselves a pit of financial instability and doom. In reading Dave Ramseys book it became all too clear that people do in fact know these basic principles that will keep them out of debt yet we willingly choose to ignore these principles for immediate satisfaction. We as consumers hide our heads in the sand hoping that our financial problems will all go away. Dave Ramsey did an excellent job and probably made a fortune telling us what we already know: stay out of debt, don't get overextended, don't use credit cards, pay cash for items, buy-don't lease etc etc etc etc.....At least someone made money from this book, Dave Ramsey!"
5,Everyone should read!,Everyone should read this book. I only wish I had this when I was young and just starting out. If I did I would have much more peace in my life then I do now.
5,Health for life,"Dr. cooper throughly explains how your body (mainly the heart and lungs) works. The book is about his studies on aerobic exercises and how it affects the body. He talks alot about his subjects and thier conditions and how aerobics helped rid themselves of thier problems. I would say to anyone who is serious about thier health, to buy this book. It's for those who are obese, those with heart and lung conditions and even those who have problems sleeping. This book is basically for anyone and everyone. Buy this book and it may help you live longer and healthier."
3,Saddlemaking guide requires intermed. knowlege of saddlery,"The author describes all the basic steps of constructing an English saddle, but this is not a saddle making instruction manual, it's more of a detailed overview.. The author skips over many steps that a saddler would consider ""obvious"", therefore at least an existing intermediate knowledge of english saddle construction is required to make best use of this reference."
4,My boys like it,Simple story. Great artwork. My boys enjoy this one. There really aren't a lot of stories out there about mowing so it's a nice change of pace. I enjoy exposing them to different types of art as well as great stories and this one is really more about the artwork than the story for me. But the story seems to work for the boys so we're all happy.
5,a fine novel,"Nick's abillity to step into the minds of the main characters' and write such a beautiful and heart-breaking story is just fantastic. This is one of the best books I've read in a long time. The chapters go by quickly. You'll find yourself laughing, depressed, elated and scared all at the same time."
2,I don't get it,"This book seemed awfully convoluted to me. It reeks of a writer more intent on impressing people than actually telling a good story. Because of that, the book collapses under its own weight. Comparisons to Selby are surprising to me, too. Is it the NYC thing? That's my only guess.If you read books to become impressed by the intellect and gifts of the author, you may like this one. It's like reading a grad school textbook in that regard. If you want to get lost in a good story, you aren't going to find it here."
1,Is this a book at all?,"Kirkus reviewed this book as perhaps the worst book published in 50 years. I don't think it's even that good. I could write a meaningful review, but it would be a waste of everyone's time. A mess of a story that tries to play on multi-cultural issues to gain readers. At the heart of this book, I find the author to be the one racially problematic. Let's hope readers look to other places for good fiction."
1,One of the worst shows TNA has ever had,"Not one match on this show delivered to the point where you will be talking about it at the end of the year. Jenna/Sharmell was one of the worst matches on PPV in quite some time. Most matches that people were looking forward to were disappointing and did not deliver. Unless you want to own every TNA PPV, there is NO reason to buy this show unless you feel like torturing yourself."
4,Sisters of War,I liked this movie. It was quite accurate with what I expected from a World War II genre with Japan and our allies. The pace of the movie was good and the cast was above average in their performances. I would recommend this movie for anyone interested in old WW II movies.
2,was very disapointed in this movie sorry that i bought it.,This movie was very over priced based on it content. It was kind of long drawn out and i dont think that it depicted thetrue brutality that the japanees were capable of with their captives during the war.
2,Very Lightweight,"I have 12 mink blankets. I absolutely love them. But, this one is not the same quality. The edges are not even. The edges look like a wave, all the way around the blanket. It is not heavy at all. You get what you pay for. I don't think the original price was $89. The weight of the blanket says 10lbs. Don't let it fool you. You will need 2, to stay warm in the winter! The color is nice. The picture looks kind of orangy...but, it is a nice chocolate brown.NEW QUEEN SOLID BROWN KOREAN MINK BLANKET"
3,Not labeled accurately,"Even though this was a good product. I thought I was buying a mink blanket from Korea. It turned out to be made in China and was not even labeled as a ""Mink Blanket"" on the package."
2,Kinda boring but interesting from a feminist perspective,"The book is from the 19th century and describes the life of a woman through her happy childhood through a more rebellious period to finally end up conforming to the expectations of everyone around her, but in the process giving up her spirit and drive. The idea is that she effaces her self as a means of escape from her time, society, and life and does not herself realize the consequences of that escape. The book is disturbing and not entertaining, and is used in many articles used in women's studies and cultural comparison."
2,"Good concept, unfortunate execution","I put about 10 rounds past this sight and realized that the green plastic reflector had blown out and the sight post was elevated and turned to the side. Apparently the post was too long and had protruded into the barrel of my Mossberg 500 Persuader. I'm a little disappointed because I like the concept and the sight picture. I'll be looking at TruGlo for other products, but I'll be looking closely at the length of the post and may dremel it down until flush. (I guess I should have looked closely at the inside of the barrel before firing, but I'm a trusting guy.)"
5,perfect,Outstanding product it fit perfectly on the Mossberg 500. I would get it for any other equipment. I am very happy
5,I thought I was in the loop,"The evening went like this: Me: So, are we gonna go, it starts in like 30 minutes Cam: Yeah, hold on I gotta change the laundry, listen to this I just picked it up Me: Who is it?? Cam: A duo called the Solar Twins, awesome remix of Rock the Casbah Me: Nevermind, don't want to hear it, I hate everything 80's Cam: Deal with it.He pushed play, and after hearing about 20 seconds I said to myself ""Why haven't I heard of this group yet?!?"" I guess Maverick didn't know a good thing when it hit them. I am one of those people who listen to three or four tracks off the CD, because those are the one's I like. Talk about the best thing I ever did was let the CD play all the way. Albeit I'm a sucker for Techno music with vocals on it, this has something special. Now, not all the tracks are dance, but they all have something you can and will like about them. If you own the Basement Jaxx ""Remedy"" and like all the tracks, you will love this CD."
2,lyrics sank this one for me,"I saw the MTV for Rock the Cashbah and went out and got the CD...the song was great, and I figured the rest of the album would be the same. While the music is ok, and only ok, many of the tracks are simply too similar and mundane to me, the lyrics really sank this album for me. Very high-schoolish lyrics loaded with cliches about the spirit and soul was an absolute fatal flaw for me. I tried real hard to like the album, but rock the cashbah is the only track that I really liked. I'd suggested getting everything but the girl's new album for better music. On a shallow side note, lead singer Joanne is HOT."
1,What? Can't I give it 0 stars?,"What can I say...I was tricked. A local major newspaper advertised this band as followers of Air, the future of electronica, blah blah blah...and I trusted it...for the last time. Where do I start? The cd cover and sleeve suck, the lyrics need a ghost writer and the sound...well, my advice is: ""Twins, give up, it wasn't meant to happen, leave it to the next incarnation, maybe then you'll be born as musicians."" If you want decent music to dance to, please refer to Perfume tree, Bentley Rythm Ace, Chemical Brothers, Fluke, anything, but please don't buy this cd, it's my last warning, you'll regret it. The music is out there."
5,Very useful,"For years I've been using jointed boards, shop-made guides, cheaper tool guides, etc... to break down sheets and guide a router. This thing is far easier to lock in place than a clamped board, as everything works from one end. No running back and forth to snug clamps.I've not had it slip, nor has the middle deflected, when used with my 18v circular saw or several routers. I would imagine that a little PSA 220 grit sandpaper would help if using the guide on materials with smooth or finished edges, like melamine.This tool is NOT self squaring, but it doesn't claim to be on the package. Mark both ends, set the edge, and flip the latch. That's it!I've created story blocks that match the tools I typically use with the edge. This eliminates math and measurement errors when placing the guide.I'm glad I bought this and it's 54 inch sister."
2,Good for square cut only,"Title says it all. If you want an angle cut, this and most others of the single clamp type, are useless. Only good guide system needs a clamp on both ends."
2,It's straight... but not worth over $100,"It's a straight edge. But probably not worth $100.I don't know if anyone would actually use the T-slots, as they look a bit small and may be prone to binding. The clamping mechanism is ok. As others have pointed out, this will not square itself up with the work you're cutting, so you have to do that.I did not find the clamps to hold particularly tight to the wood. Even with the ""wide"" clamps (which only are the width of the track).Also, the unit could be a bit longer, particularly to help on the start and finish of the cut to give plenty of room for the shoe of the circular saw to track.Realistically, you're probably better off just making a cutting guide using a factory edge from a piece of wood, angle iron, etc."
3,It works ok but it didn't meet my expectations,"This track does its job but it takes some doing and messing around with it to get it clamped up right. I seem to always have to adjust the clamp 3-4 times before I get a good clamp on a precise cut. Just expected it to be a little easier to use, more intuitive out of the box. Again, probably too high on my expectations, so 3 stars for doing the job, but no more."
1,"Edge Guide Not Straight, 1/8 Inch Out!",Nice design concept with very bad manufacturing quality. The one thing I do ask of a cutting guide is that it be straight. Mine's warped 1/8 inch over the length. I would have been happy with 1/64 inch error.
1,"Great design, however, it WILL flex!","Great design, however, it WILL flex in mid-cut if you are holding a circular saw or router tightly against the clamp. It will NOT be a straight cut. This clamp needs to be beefier. So, I returned it to Amazon.com. I thank them for that."
4,Great Week-End Read,"I spent last week-end with the characters of Rocket City, and seven days later, I miss them. Alpert weaves tale of parallel but intertwined lives that makes putting the book down virtually impossible. I found myself truly caring for these characters despite their very human foibles. I'd ask for a sequel, but that would destroy the one playing out in my mind. I will lend this book out, but I won't give it away. This may be a rare reread."
4,A chat with Cathryn Alpert about writing Rocket City,"One of the members of my book club said she knew Cathryn Aplpert and had taught her children in school. She invited Cathryn to come and talk about Rocket City with our book club and low and behold, she did! What a book, what an author. We rarely all agree on a book, but all ten members of the club enjoyed the adventure and humor of this book. Cathryn was great fun and willing to answer all of our questions. We asked what is commonly asked at her appearances, ""Do you know any dwarfs?"""
3,Quirky novel that just sputters...,"Cathryn Alpert's ""Rocket City"" is different. That I can say in praise of it. The novel follows the misadventures of two characters, Marie Levitay and Figman in parallel narratives as both try to find themselves in the Southern New Mexico desert. Marie wants to marry Larry, an odd duck that does strange Zen experiments, and he's a jerk to boot. Marie has an mysterious dwarf that hitchhikes to help set her straight. Figman is on the run from his conscience and thinks he's dying. Both find themselves in strange relationships and one ultimately finds love. An interesting diversion, but nothing that ultimatley stays with you."
4,Good quality,"I found thes too be good quality. They are big, but the quality of the view is good. These are perfect for going to games, concerts or even out on a hike. I am not sure they are too good if you have to hide them, i.e. sneak into a stadium, but they really are good quality!"
5,Play in animals - the best book available,Gordon Burghardt;s book is an exceptionally complete review of play behavior in many diverse species of animals. It will set the standard for future research and volumes in this very popular area of research. Recommended for undergraduate and graduate courses in animal behavior and for people who want to know more about this fascinating behavioral phenomenon.
3,Neutral,"If you plan on getting this program go to http://www.bloodshed.net and get a free C++ compiler. Use it to compile DLL files for your games. Not being able to compile with Visual C++ that comes on the CD really makes hard to create you're own effects for games. Learn C++, download the free compiler and learn how to use the free compiler. Not all code will work automatically with Dev-C++ so you need to find you're own work arounds. It comes with the lates compiler which I think is GCC 3.6 (see gcc's website)."
1,What I think of this starter kit,1. It is a great disappointment2. The only thing I could open was the demo3. It says its for windows 2000 & XP and its not4. I feel like i've been conned because I thought this was all great...5. Don't disappoint yourself just dont buy this6. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT-WARNING-HEALTH HAZARDS APPLY
5,Great book!,"I really like this book! It explained the 'laws' of how emotions can affect a person's physical body in a clear, understandable manner - taught me things in a logical way that I'd never put together before. I recommend it!"
5,Brita Review,I have been using the Brita Filter for a number of years. It makes the water drinkable from the faucet. I also use it for making tea or coffee. Prior to buying the Filter I had to buy water now I just use water from the filtered faucet. Very good to have.
3,Having second thoughts,"This model of Brita filters are more compact (and stylish) than some other brands. All the brands I tried seemed to work equally well for the purpose. I used this filter over many years and for just drinking/cooking water for a single person, they used to last almost a year. Lately they don't even last 5-6 months. I can't tell if it's the city water or the filters that have gotten worse. I may still buy them if I find at good price but no longer crazy about them."
5,"These filters are always peachy keen, just too expensive.","Very convenient, easy to change, readily available. I have however ordered an inline filter. It should last much longer, function equally well, and, the deciding factor, I got 3 of them for $20. I figure at least a 50% cost savings, depending on longevity."
3,good stuff,"it is slightly cheaper than in the retail shop. This replacement should not have anything wrong, but we have trouble with the hook-up. It almost failed with its first filter, creating leaks and waste a lot of filtered water."
2,Replacement in a non tamper proof box.,All pictures I have seen show this product in a tamper proof packaging. Was very shocked to find mine in boxes with slight scratches on top of filter .
4,Well Water and Brita Filter,"Our water comes from a well, so we do not have the issues associated with city tap water (chlorine taste, etc.). Before reaching our sinks, the water passes through two paper filter systems and an ultra violet light system. Still, the taste of the water varies by season (assuming due to run off) and at times contains sediment that makes the water cloudy or off color. The water from the kitchen sink where the Brita Filter is installed almost always runs clear now and the taste is pretty consistent."
5,Bottled water is a con job,"We've been using Brita tap filters for a few years now. As I exercise daily, I consume a lot of water, and the Brita filter helps with the taste of our tap. We have to replace them about once every 3-4 months."
1,It was a defected TAP replacement,"I dont know but looked like a defected piece, i had to go to bed bath and beyong and buy another one and amazon did not accept to take it back"
1,DECEPTIVE ITEM TITLE,This seller is trying to give the impression there are six units at this price... there is only ONE.
4,First Timer,"I've played all the team sports game (FIFA, NHL, MLB, NBA, etc..) but Madden 07 was my first experience with American football. Awesome!Except for a couple of bugs (wrong audio, weird transparent effects), the game plays well in the rookie mode, better in the pro and even better on the All-Pro level. After three months of intensive training (gotta know your audibles), I'm now playing All-Madden and getting my butt kicked by the 49ers...The mini game is boring but unlocks teams and tracks songs (useless).The ad-hoc and infrastructure mode play better than other games (MLB 06), but it's still a work in progress that will never actually progress because of the weak wifi (b) capabilities provided by the PSP.Now that the football season is almost over, it's time to pickup the game."
2,"If you don't know the ins and outs of football, then walk away...","I've always tried to get into football games.My friends really digg them and we usually have similar game tastes.I don't watch football, and I've never really entirely understood it (I of course get the basics thankyouverymuch).This game has one of the worst learning curves I've ever experienced.I love when I can pick up a game and have a general understanding on how to play.This is not one of those games."
2,Very Disappointed!,"I was very disappointed in this game as the reviews had billed it as a very enjoyable plot driven First Person Shooter. I knew that it was a port of an older PC game, so I wasn't expecting, nor does the game deliver, anything other than serviceable graphics. However, given the older game engine and low quality graphics, I was very surprised that the game played so poorly on my iBook 500. Graphics are slow, movement is jerky, controls are unresponsive, and everything generally feels sluggish. Further, I had read reports of funny cut scenes and entertaining dialogue, but I found that both the plot and the ""humorous dialogues"" are even worse than standard issue. I've also had several crashes. This is certainly no Duke Nuke 'em.Overall, I would have to recommend either Jedi Knight II or Castle Wolfenstein as both play MUCH better performance-wise while featuring up-to-date graphics and much more entertaining plots."
2,Companion web site not there,"The companion web site mentioned in the book is not there. When I typed in that URL, I got redirected to Peachpit's advertising site of this book, but no ""links"", ""tools"", nor ""examples"" mentioned in the book at all!"
2,Boring textbook,I had to buy this book for a class. It is an extremely boring read and I struggle to keep myself awake while reading it (as does the rest of the class I am told). It does tell you about Dreamweaver though and I suppose that is its purpose. One thing that I do not like is the way the author is constantly bashing Internet Explorer and other isp's. His personal opinions are a real turn-off and unnecessary.
4,works like it should,"works just like it should. i took off one star only because it only clamps down on smooth surfaces, but thats any of these clamps. good bargin"
1,Terrible design,"I ordered the 48"" version of this useless clamp. The sliding mechanism doesn't slide and the locking mechanism doesn't lock where you set it. When you can set it. It's virtually impossible to use ""quickly"". VERY disappointed. I waited too long to return it so I had to eat it. I used it as a bat until it broke for good, then trashed it.Better versions can be had at either Woodworker or Peachtree. Rockler sells the same POS so don't bother there."
1,Not good.,"Here we are the 2nd week of school and turns out I was sent the WRONG book. And, as it's not anything I thought to check-via the publisher page listing of the ISBN number, I don't have any of the return shipping labels required for me to return this book. So I'll get to purchase the book again.ISBN should have been 0130366145 and I got ISBN 0131663054 which is missing 2 full sections required for the course."
2,"Beautiful, but...",My friend loved it when she received it as my gift on her birthday. But after 2-3months... The little fancy diamond inside detached...
3,It's OK,"Gives the facts, but a lot of fluff and (what appears to me to be) conjecture thrown in about Cullen. Cullen was a nut case, but the author uses this book as a personal vendetta against the psycho."
4,Occasional woodworker,"As an occasional woodworker the Bench Clamp with T-track has observably improved my dealing with surfaces, gluing and routing for the past 5 years. It is another technical step to make the work and working better. W. Paul Mouchon"
4,Great Looking and Comfortable,The is a great looking shoe and is it very comfortable. I even ordered another pair in a different color.
3,"this is for the ""first timers""","I've had this amp for about 6 months now and I am an avid car audio junkie been this way for over 20 years, I really like MTX but it seems like they and all the other amp makers out there are offering less and less for more and more money. This one does the job but just barely if your really into music pass this one up. I have it pushing 2 6x9, 2 door speakers, and 2 tweeters 15 years ago this same amp would have been too much for a little set up like this. I guess I should spend more money."
1,So bad it's great,"This movie is a classic bad biker movie. Bad movie and bad bikers. Nicholson and Bruce Dern are great, and it seems that most of the dialogue must have been adlibbed. No one can write this badly. All the sterotypes are here and if you can hold your lunch down, or keep from hyperventilating from laughter, you will have a great time."
1,Worse than Cycle Savages and Angels Wild Women,"I didn't think I'd find a worse biker movie (and I like the genre a lot) than Cycle Savages but this is it. I agree with whoever said the dialogue must be ad libbed. Bruce Dern, Jack Nicholson, Cameron Mitchell and Diane Ladd, and this is the best they can come up with. Mitchell's pathetic attempt at getting help from the people of a one dog town instead of smacking the crap out of the wimp deputy and taking is gun is sickening enough, but this is the lamest excuse for a bike gang I've ever seen. Never thought I'd see a movie that made Cycle Savages look good, but this is it. The one thing this movie has is a couple of real nice looking bikes (which is what I watch motorcycle movies for), the customized Triumph that Dern rides an the high exhuast piped model Jack Nicholson is on are the only semi-redeeming things in this movie."
3,Bad but worth it.,It's a classic bad movie that's worth watching at least once. It does have a couple slow parts but all in all you'll be laughing out loud and talking about it when its over.
2,Animations and less,"This product is dissappointing. The title says animations and more, but there is only animations. The folders for fonts, sounds and videos are empty. Some of the animations are not animated. The pictures are very poor quality. Some are not very clear. The search engine will find something if you give it the exact folder to look in. There are no keywords to search by. There is no manual with the CD and the help file is not all that helpful. The program is generally not user friendly."
3,An expansion of Alois P.Swoboda's Theory,This book further develops Alois P. Swoboda's theory of Conscious Evolution which is designed to help the individual direct their own personal evolutionary responses to changes in society and life in general. I found it interesting although it is slow to develop as it is written in an early 1900s style.
4,A Sigh of Relief and a plan for Hope!,"When this book arrived in the mail and I began reading it, I really did get a sigh of relief. I realized that there was 'something' out there to help us! Reading this book made me feel like I could handle selective mutism with my child. It gives clear ideas/plans of action and is very realistic. I highly recommend this book to ppl dealing with this debilitating disorder. I am proud and relieved to say that my daughter is close to exhibiting NO signs of SM. Much of this, is because of the excellent advise in this awesome book."
3,Great,"I bought this because I thought it was less expensive than other sites, only to get it and realize that it came with nothing else. My husband loves it."
1,Don't be fooled,"Don't be fooled. This product is not the Milwaukee you expect. You can imagine my frustration when I purchased this high quality tool only to discover ""Made in China."" on the label. If I wanted Chinese quality I would have gone to Harbor Freight or purchased a Crafstman. For the price I paid, I expected a quality Milwaukee product made in North America."
5,Very detailed,This was the second book I have read about Shanda. This one goes into more depth and understand of what happened. I completely recommend it.
5,Sad!,"Sad! What happened to this girl was sad and tragic! I felt sorry for the girls who commited this murder, but I felt more for the child they tortured!"
4,Places the blame right where it belongs,"""Little Lost Angel"" is a horrifying account of what was done to poor little Shanda Sharer. There is no defense for what those four spoiled, selfish, teenagers did to her, and this book doesn't try to make you feel sorry for them. A much better choice than Aphrodite Jones' ""Cruel Sacrifice"", which clearly wants your sympathy to lie with these brutal murderers, rather than with the twelve year old victim. ""Little Lost Angel"" acknowleges that, yes, these girls had trauma in their lives, but doesn't attempt to absolve them of responsiblity for their actions. And it clearly indicates that the real victim was a helpless little girl who stepped out of her house to talk to someone and was subjected to hours of torture and abuse before being burned alive by four people, three of whom didn't even know her and just thought it would be cool to go along for the ride."
5,Sad story,"Awesome book, sad story. Being from Louisville and only a few years younger than Shanda really hit a spot for me bc I've grown up with the punk kids like Laurie, Melinda, and Toni and the followers like hope who wanted to fit in so bad she would go to great lengths to be liked, I feel she should have gotten the same sentence as the rest. She is just as responsible for shandas death as if she'd lit the fire herself."
5,A Diabolical Crime,"I picked up a copy of this book years ago when it was first released. Being from Louisville, KY, I knew it would be a difficult book to read, as I was well aware of the circumstances surrounding this horrendous murder that happened in our own ""back yard"" as it were, and most people from this region of the country followed the case from the moment of the murder, to the subsequent arrests, and the painful trial that followed.It is a difficult book to read, without question. But it is a book which must be read, if for no other reason than to understand what horrible things can happen even among young people when a hidden desire to murder is present. It's a cautionary tale of what can go wrong when certain other factors are present, and parents should take a second look at the friends of their children; especially if they see things that trouble them."
2,Clueless. Unintentionally homophobic. Focus is a bit off.,"Book is ok as far as true crime goes, but when the author talks about the gay angle it's always that Shanda was forced into it, talked into it and completely at a loss. No comment in that the parents interrogated her for an hour in trying to get her to admit to lesbian activity, and the author takes great pains to say that Shanda was not a lesbian unlike the fighting coke snorting bunch that killed her. She was just experimenting.The author also misses out on Amanda who is the only interesting character in the book. He pretty much dismisses her as a dyke and doesn't mind the fact that parents shun her for that reason.Ok if you like books about white trash girls going dyke and getting killed but skip the moralizing please!"
3,I know Laurie Tackett,I do feel very deeply for the parents of Shanda but I must also say that I spent 9months at Rockville Correctional with Laurie Tackett and that she is not the monster that everyone portrays her to be. She is not someone who is not remorseful for what happened. She is a very loving and caring person. She truly is sympathetic over the whole ordeal. She lives with this everyday and every night. Let me say that I do not condone what happened but let me also say that I believe that Melinda is a horrible person and that the other girls fell under her spell. They where all young. It was very wrong but I must defend Laurie because she does feel pain. She is in know way a monster!!!!
5,Little Lost Angel blows Cruel Sacrifice out of the water,"As someone who actually KNEW Shanda, went to school with her, ate lunch with her occasionally and was forunate enough to call her my friend; I must say that Mister Quinlan hit the old nail on the head when he wrote this book. Ms. Aphrodite Jones set out to portray Shanda as a little dyke when she wasn't! She was only 12 1/2 for crying out loud, people. :( I know Melinda Loveless and I feel that she got exactly what she deserved. The same is to be said for Laurie Tackett, Hope Rippey and Toni Lawrence. This is not something that is easily forgotten, especially by me; more so by them though. No longer can Shanda's bell like laughter fill my ears, no longer can I tell my innermost personal secrets to her. She was my friend and I'll never forget her. Thank you and God bless, Jack Eugene Moore III"
4,How I loved and hated the book,"I just finished reading this truly shocking book a few moments ago and I cannot stop thinking about it. I'm 13 this year 2000. When Shanda was murdered, i was a mere 5 years old. The thought that she could be a 20-year-old young and fine lady at this point in time saddens me. I cannot believe it. The story itself was written in such a way I couldn't put it down. I finished the whole book in 25 hours, stopping to sleep and go to school. I absolutely loved the book. BUT THEN... last night when i was 3/4 through the book, I couldn't get to sleep, the murder was so gruesome I kept thinking about it. I couldn't stand those shadows in my bedroom wall, knowing I might not be so safe after all... nevertheless, read it if you feel you are mature enough to gulp such horrible facts easily."
4,A Heartbreaking Story,"This is the most tragic and gruesome story about teens I have ever read in my life. I couldn't believe these girls were capable of murder, young as they were. It is a real tear-jerker, and whoever reads it should be prepared to cry A LOT. As sad as it is, however, it should be read by the entire world just to know how Shanda's life was ended so abruptly, when she had an intelligent future in her hands."
5,A powerful indictment of today's permissive society,"Shakespeare's play ""Macbeth"" had three witches, this story has four. But while the witches in ""Macbeth"" were interesting characters, the witches Loveless, Tackett, Rippey, and Lawrence committed a horrific act that not even a playwright of Shakepeare's genius could have devised. These fictional witches stirred a cauldron of food and water, while the four witches of this story ignited a cauldron of grief and despair for Shanda's family and friends which will never simmer down. How ironic it is that one of their stops on that fatal night was the witches castle. If they are ever released from prison, they should take up residence there. This book emphasises the yawning gaps between some parents and their children, and graphically depicts the tragedies that ensue if these gaps are not bridged."
4,"Great atmosphere, resource hog","I love the Alien movies, and so I was awaiting this game. I was surprised when it was slow even on my 1Ghz Mac. I emailed the company and they say they know the problem and will be issuing a patch. Let's hope that's soon.I can't play this game while I'm alone in the dark. Seriously, it's got a great eerie atmosphere, even better than Half-Life. I'm enjoying the missions right now while I become accustomed to the controls, and I'm looking forward to the multiplayer gaming especially."
1,Simply Awful,"A word of warning: MacPlay's claims to the contrary notwithstanding, ""AvP2"" will NOT run ok on a G4. I've got a 1GHz G4 with 512 MB (well within the requirements, supposedly) and the game runs so choppily that it looks like stop-motion photography. Add to that:1) Endless load times. We're talking minutes here.2) So-so graphics (you have to turn the detail way down to get anything approaching an acceptable frame rate)3) Constant, irritating bugs. ""AvP2"" crashes ALL the time. Incredibly, even the end credits are glitchy.The game concept may be kind of cool, but MacPlay's ""AvP2"" has got to be one of the worst, most slapdash ports in history. Again, DON'T buy it unless you're running a G5 or dual 1.25 G4s--you'll be wasting $..."
2,Fast beats elongivity.,"it does make a significant difference. it makes it faster than before. yet, it last too short. i thought it was going to make it last more than 10 minutes. but it doesn't. i am not disappointed at the batteries, but at the product. it is also hard to replace. just in case you feel like buying multiple one to change on the road."
1,utof date when shipped,...this product was out of date when received so I called CS. They promptly replaced the product with another out of date box. I was issued a refund after receiving the second box. Amazon needs to rotate their stock or check expiration dates on products.I am unable to rate the actual product.
5,Excellent for the beginning pattern-maker,"It took awhile for me to discover that almost nobody (literally, no BODY!) can use commercial patterns without considerable alteration. Authors such as Nancy Zieman explain why this is so in their books on pattern alteration, as well as suggesting possible solutions. Rene Bergh goes an important step further: avoid many of the commercial pattern misfit issues by making your own pattern from scratch! I've tried it and it's fairly simple to do. There is a minimum of math involved; anybody who can use a ruler and recognize a 90 angle can apply the instructions in this book.I've used the book frequently to draft patterns for theatrical costumes; it has been lifesaving! In sum, I'd recommend this to anyone, particularly a novice or non-professional pattern drafter."
5,Handy Book!,"Rene Bergh takes the mystery out of making patterns by providing simple instructions that anyone can do. I especially like the instructions for making pants patterns. I have never been able to make pants that fit properly, and now I can make them whenever I want. Hooray! I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys sewing and would like to make clothes that fit properly."
4,Good for Newbies Too,"I'm not a seamstress, and I have limited sewing experience, but I have to say this book not only made pattern-making look easy, but it also made me feel I can truly make my own patterns.This book provides lots of drawings gives step by step instructions that anyone can follow. Even if you don't have tons of sewing experience, you'll find this book a great resource."
2,Not Quite Right,"i have easy measurements, average possibly small figure and this book produced nothing but giganttic slopers on me, terrible. I've used this book a lot and it did nothing bu makes these huge clothes that look like the huge boxy 80's clothing in the book. THe instructions are clear, but my results, time after time, have been horrible from following the directions in this book..."
2,"Forgot the ""Fit"" part","This is a basic pattern making book. But as I went through the steps of making a pattern, I realized there was no fitting advice. Unless you are totally symetrical, you can't get a garment that fits from just taking your measurments. This book doesn't tell you how to make allowances for a high bust, a sloping shoulder, etc. I wouldn't recommend it for beginners and experienced sewers probably already know what this book teaches. By the way, it was written in England."
3,What happened before Hell!,"This graphic novel is split into three parts, the first two are excellent, the third doesn't seem to fit. The artwork is excellent and we get to see Xena at her evil best. It was fairly enjoyable, but not the best."
5,An outstanding read; very original!,"Jimerson has put together quite a work that is original in its focus on the individual participants and observers of the Civil War--both northerners and southerners. The use of primary sources is so extensive and direct that the book is basically a 200-odd page compilation of quotes, effectively showing how each side viewed the other. The work is further illuminated with a chapter on black soliers............An outstanding piece!!!"
3,Preciously bad,"I just heard Pat Boone's ""We Are Family"" with Sister Sledge on National Public Radio. It is so funny, it is almost worth buying the CD. I wish Amazon offered the track to listen to. The three stars are for the laughter that that I so needed today!"
1,They don't last,"I've used these bowls for about 2 years, and they are cracking and falling apart at the base. I own other Melamine bowls from Target that are holding up perfectly, as new as the day I got them 3 years ago. This particular bowl is just plain poor."
2,NOT MICROWAVABLE,"NOT MICROWAVABLE Shouldn't that be in the description of the bowls? They must be meant to be salad bowls, because that is the only thing that doesn't need to be warmed up in a microwave! Cute but of limited usefulness."
4,Plastic bowls,I was not expecting plastic bowls. I was not educated enough on melamine products.However I really like these. My husband uses them for ice cream and I plan to buy the matching plates and use them for outdoor patio use or camping.
4,AN EXCELLENT EYE CREAM,"With over 30 years experience as a pharmaceutical and dermatological chemist, Canadian Ben Kamins continues to work in progressive skin care. To date, he has created a line of skin care products that is both innovative and effective.Of particular interest is his Bio-Maple line. Bio-Maple is defined as a compound that rehydrates and helps repair the skin. I found that to be true with this Eye Cream.It is fragrance and color free and makes a perfect eye makeup primer. Morning and night use is recommended. In addition, if the eye area is extremely dry the cream may be lightly reapplied during the day over makeup."
1,"yes, underwhelming indeed.","I am having a difficult time getting interested in this, I must agree with the other bad reviews on this book. Will drop it and go on to the next on my pile. Too bad other authors are so willing to endorse and promote bad books like this one. It is really boring. I've read Parker in the past and he was so much better."
2,Little Saigon,"I am a huge T. Jefferson Parker fan. For some reason, I could not get into this book - but I definitely will not give up on Mr Parker!"
5,Jeff Parker's Best,"I just finished reading Border Lords. T. Jefferson Parker just gets better as a novelist as the years roll by. However, I read Little Saigon nearly two decades back. It still remains not only my favorite Parker novel, but my favorite crime novel of all time! When I visited Westminster, California, in 2009, I understood the town perfectly--well perfectly for a westerner--thanks to having read Little Saigon. In Parker's early books, he often explored the ruptures inside of family relationships--especially father/son, and brother/brother. In this particular book, he nailed it. He also explored the personal torment of fear... Having watched surfers quite a few times, it is firghtening just for the viewing. This is a marvelous and complex novel. Finely crafted. I told everyone I knew about T. Jefferson Parker those two decades back, and he subsequently proved my words by winning the Edgar twice. T. Jefferson Parker is the best who ever trolled the waters of crime fiction."
1,Put it down,"I glady put it down. Just awful and could not get past Chapter 7. Really forced myself to get that far. I read his Rayborn and Hunter series and thought they were good, this however is insipid. Seems like it was written by a guy with a dictionary on a long flight or two."
1,Horrible,"This was the third Jefferson Parker book that I have read (having read his first and third books) and was looking forward to more classy detective fiction featuring characters that I liked and a storyline that was Ross Macdonald-like.What I got was a book that started so quickly and poorly I couldn't believe it. Loads of characters that did nothing for me, dialogue that was terrible and a lead character who at best was insipid.I have the next 11 books that Parker has written on my shelf, hope none of them are as woeful as this effort."
1,Pure Garbage,"Really really bad, jingoist, myopic, unthrilling thriller. I usually like T. Jefferson, but I hated this one. Blech!"
3,Light Fare for a Goofy Afternoon of Goofing,"Just a clump of FUN ROCKIN tunes to while away a non-descript day in the life. Why does everything have to be compared to ""the greatest Stuff EVER, Dude!!!"" Relax. Surrender."
4,Works great,This worked great for extra sun protection. It is a little flimsy and can be blown off if the its windy outside. However its easily adjustable and a great value for the price.
3,Not as useful as I had hoped,"I purchased this shade to put on the front seat of my double stroller, as the shade up there is a a joke....The connections on the Kiddopotomus are not designed for that sort of use and it was too awkward to be useful. It is now in a heap in the front entry way and I am considering a clip on umbrella for the toddler in the front of my Graco, but I gave it 3 stars anyway as it looks like it would do what it says it will on a single stroller that already has a largish shade to support the extra sunshade....and yes I know that it says it is for a single stroller, but there doesn't appear to be one designed for a ""single file"" type double stroller!"
2,barely works,"It is UV protection and it's better than nothing (thus the 2 stars instead of 1).PROS:Better than the stroller's shade.CONS:In the wind it flops around and is therefore useless as a sunshade.Bent within 2 days of light use.Doesn't fold up while on the stroller, so when going from outside to inside (say into a store, etc) you have to remove it.Have to remove it from an umbrella stroller to fold the stroller.ALTERNATIVE:Baby Sun Throw from Coolibar. It's 50+ UPF and with a little iron-on Velcro you can drape it over your baby's lap in the stroller and Velcro it to itself and have it stay put."
4,Excellent shade,"This shade is excellent. It can be pull all the way down when my son is sleeping, so no sun or wind would bother him. The only thing is that when it's very windy, the shade would swing to the side when you have the shade very low. Overall, for the price and effectiveness, it's a very good purchase! I want my son to get vitamin D, but not right on his face!!"
4,A Great book for people of size,"First off, I'd like to say that this book was witty and well written. It is easy to read and touches on a lot of those concerns we fat people may have. Health, Love, and yes, Sex. There are also fantastic references in the back of the book that lead to clothing retailors and personal boards among other things. It's a nice reference book to have around....It makes light of what this book is truely about. Love. Loving oneself and loving others.Buy Big, Big Love. You won't regret it."
3,Not all that enlightening,"While this book was full of interesting stats, it gave me little information that was helpful. The things that were covered were very elementary - anyone who is big knows that you can't crush or suffocate your lover unintentionally - why spend so much time talking about it?"
3,Misrepresented...,"I was looking forward to receiving this book in the mail, when it finally got here I am somewhat disappointed. I really wasn't looking for a lesson in fat discrimination 101. I AM a BBW and I'm sure for those of us who are can certainly identify with fat discrimination, but why call a book ""A sourcebook on sex for people of size and those who love them"" when the majority of the book is about fat discrimination in sexual relationships and how to overcome it. The VERY LAST chapter is about actual sexual positions, and sex in general. The rest of the book deals with tips on meeting people, how to feel confident etc.Not to be too harsh, it does speak very well on the subject matter above, but the title and description of the book should definitely be changed."
5,Who knew?,I never knew that there was a book out there that could help me in such a way. I loved this book. Thank God there are people like Hanne Blank. More and more people of size and those who love them need to wake up. get out there and be proud!
2,Time is not a renewable resource,"I got this movie because it came highly recommended to me. I was told its very, very scary.I'm not sure which is more scary. The fact that they'd make this movie available to the public,or that I can't get back the time I wasted watching this.I've seen episodes of Gilligan's Island that were more suspenseful than this.I don't know. Maybe having to spend the time reading subtitles distracted me too much.Maybe I've just seen other ghost stories that left this in the dust.I'm sorry, I just can not recommend this movie. I was rather disappointed."
2,Could have been a 4 star,"For me, this would have have been a great entertaining movie - good plot, good acting, good suspense. As a US citizen, english is my primary language. I do not have reservations in watching movies off of the subtitles. In ths case having the subtitles did not allow me to keep pace with this movie. This was a barrier to enjoy it. There's nothing wrong with dubbing - look at the animated films today."
1,The opposite of scary: BORING,Don't waste your time.... There are so many holes in this story and the production that even the paranoid will run out of the room from boredom not fear.....
1,SPANISH?!?!?,"This movie is in Spanish and can be ordered in no other language - as I found out too late. I did learn a valuable lesson, tho...always scroll down and look at ""language"" in the film's description and you will learn which language it is in. Bummer, but my fault for not reading the fine print. Betcha I don't make that mistake again!!"
5,Del Toro does it again!,"Before I go into this movie review, let one thing be said: THIS IS A SPANISH MOVIE, IF YOU DO NOT KNOW THAT, DON'T WATCH IT! So many people dismiss watching this because they don't want to read subtitles, Spanish is an easy language and beautiful language, learn it.The movie:This is by far, one of the creepiest and thrilling movies I've seen in a long while. My hair was standing straight up on the back on my neck for the latter half of the movie. I just can't stress enough how utterly and honestly creepy this is. Del Toro is an amazing director who doesn't need blood, gore and effects to make his movies true. I'd vote for this movie to be one of the best of the year. Best horror movie, Best Thriller, Best Foreign movie, Best BEST AND BEST!!!!"
4,Don't dismiss this as just a horror film...,"As I watched this film, I was struck by the chills of the traditional horror film that other reviewers have written about. But after it was all over, I was moved and heart broken as a parent. Don't dismiss this film as ""just"" a horror film. The real chills are the ones that are not supernatural. Sometimes the supernatural is there for us to explain the things that happen in a way we can deal with."
3,Movie of Nothing,"As any film on unexplained or horror, a story of former orphan's plan to renovate her former closed orphanage building into a family-run seaside hotel, is lacking of any practical logic and far remote from reality as everything else occurred during run of plot rather psycho-delusive than worth being created at all.There are much worse movies of such gender and if some wasted time and money to watch, it is good for producers anyway."
3,MORE SAD THAN SCARY!,"Surprisingly restrained considering the trailer had so many threatening and spooky images. I will say that 'The Orphanage' does get an A for atmosphere, but reading subtitles during this film distracted me from the experience. I usually pass on films with subtitles, but this film seemed too good to pass up and there are always exceptions to the rule. It's a pretty easy film to follow, even though this was played up to be a very spooky film, I found it to be more sad than scary. The DVD transfer looks very good and this is worth seeing, but maybe rent before buying it."
2,Orphanage - not what I expected,"Bought by mistake, it is in Spanish, and not that great of a movie. Meant to by the Orphan. Gave this movie to a spanish speaking friend,"
4,The orpanage,This is a very good movie. I just wished the movie would have also come in English (not the englsih subtitles). Very touching at the end.
4,Just a little Disappointed,"First I would like to say that overall I did enjoy this movie. It was both visually elegant and compelling. The acting was also nicely done. However, the movie just didn't grab me in the way that ""Pan's Labyrinth"" did.This film followed the same basic premise of telling a child's ghost/fairy story to adults. However, ""The Orphanage"" just failed in being entirely original in it's ability to update/retell that same basic formula. The movie ended up feeling like a cross between ""Poltergeist"" and ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" with a little bit of M. Night Shyamalan thrown in for good measure.While watching it, it all seemed to work. But after it finished I was left feeling somehow cheated by the story, it just didn't feel like it fully came together at the end."
4,Creepy and well done,"Creepy tale of missing children and desolation, plays as a cross between 'The Ring' and 'Pan's Labyrinth'."
5,A gorgeous film,"I'm sure I'm not the first to say this, but it's true. I love and miss the way M. Night Shyamalan used to make movies. His recent outings haven't been as terrible as their reviews might lead one to expect, but it is obvious that they lack the intelligence and emotional resonance of works like Unbreakable, The 6th Sense, and Signs. The reason I mention this is that The Orphanage reminded me powerfully of what I used to love so much in his films. It is an incredible blend of intensely terrifying moments (it's not a very scary film overall, but it does have some of the very most suspenseful scenes I've ever seen) and intensely emotional scenes. It is exceptionally well written and acted, with an especially standout performance from Belén Rueda. It is beautifully filmed, and has Guillermo Del Toro's wonderfully creative fingerprints all over it. And above all, it is an amazing story, and a must-see ESPECIALLY for people who don't like horror films."
1,This is scary?,"Ok,this movie sucked ...first off-Slapstick music doesnt go well with a supposed horror movie.-there was only 1 scary part in the whole hour and 45 min of the movie-Subtitles(I WANT TO BE ABLE TO WATCH THE MOVIE,NOT THE DAMN SUBTITLES)This movie was a waste of time and money.To be honest I cut the movie off about an hour into it.LOL aND I'M sorry but if you got scaRED by this movie...you're...a....panzy..."
1,How can anyone get scared if most of the time is spend reading?,".....You have got to be kidding me!!!! How are so many people rating this movie so good? It may be a great movie, but not if I have to read the whole damn thing!!!! Am I missing something here? I went thru all controls and found nothing in english without subtitles. Is there an english version of this movie that I dont know about? .....unbelievable!!!"
3,The Orphanage,"No where in your write-up or synopsis did it mention that this movie was not in english without subtitles. It wasn't mentioned on the cover either. Why isn't there an english speaking version? If there is an english version, send it to me, please"
3,The Orphanage,"very entertaining..... the subtitles in english were a bit distracting, since I am a native spanish-speaker"
2,"Watch out! The spoken language is Spanish only, with English subtitles.","The Orphanage is not a bad movie, with ok story line, good filming and acting,but, in my opinion left much to be disired because the spoken language is Spanish, only. Yes, I failed to read the fine print on the DVD specs before buying it, and assumed that it had an English voice track, which it does not - regretable, I think, leaving English speaking viewers to try to follow the story with subtitles only. If you want to do that, go for it. - allstar"
2,Expected so much more,"I LOVE scary/suspense movies and I've been waiting to see this movie for awhile. Previews made it look so scary. It had only Spanish dialogue with English subtitles, which make it hard to get totally into the movie because you have to keep looking down to read. I was expecting a very suspenseful supernatural thriller and this movie just did not deliver. Sure the kid with the mask was kinda creepy but that is about the extent of it. The trailers are probably the scariest part of the film, everything else was a big yawn. For me this movie was a huge disappointment. I feel they could have done so much more with it. My recommendation is to wait until it comes on regular tv to watch it. I was almost bored enough to not even finish the movie."
4,Finely Crafted Horror Movie,"The movie is more of a character study than a horror movie. The movie does a great job of presenting a puzzle that the mother has to solve to get her son back. The movie is scary, but the gore is at a minimum level. The horror of losing one's child is horror enough. The acting is superb. The plot is finely crafted. The movie introduces very minor story lines or themes that are nicely tied together at the end. I won't give up the ending, but it fits almost too nicely."
4,The Orphanage,I don't watch to many scary movies. But I really like the way this one was filmed. Had a few problems with not hearing the audio (had the volume all the way up on 50).
4,A fine little chiller,"A workshop in being scary. Amid the dreck of the genre, this movie shines. Dread fills the room as you watch. There is a moment of insight, as in ""Don't Look Now"", that fills us with despair. What great movie making. Run out and get this. Put it on your netflix."
4,Artfully spooky,"This was one of the best scary films i have seen recently in terms of how eloquently the story line was written. It is nothing like some of the cheesier over the top horror movies that have come out recently. Every little detail in this movie makes sense and has a purpose, they are not obscure and pointless. The acting is all quite excellent as well, all the parts were great casting choices. If you are a fan of foreign films, and scary movies then this is a great mash up. Although its difficult to keep your eyes covered when your reading subtitles, it was still view-able as it avoided over using gore as its means of instilling fright in the viewer. It was a really good movie."
4,Good but no cigar,"I like Del Toro films but I usually get the same feeling I do when I watch a Stephen King movie. It seems to have all the elements. It is well done. But in the end one feels unsatisfied. Something is missing. Can't put your finder on it but it could be great but just falls short. Good acting, good atmosphere, but while I liked it I just felt it was missing that little something that makes a movie a real 5 star. To see what I mean watch Playing Games. Now that's 5 star."
5,"excellent movie , one of my favorites","i would definitely recomend this product, it is awsome. good movie good servive. the plot was just excellent, it is a thrill."
5,Great movie,This movie is scary and very heart-warming at the same time. Even though there are subtitiles (and I'm not a fan of subtitles) it's easily one of my favorite movies.
3,"quite suspenseful,if very bleak (3.5/5)","thought this was a very good suspense movie.there were a number of creepy moments,and thankfully no cheap scares.i also liked the fact that unlike in many of types of films,there are no gimmicky CGI ghosts that look ridiculous.the acting is very good too,especially from the woman who plays the mother.i did think it was bit long though,at 105 minutes.i think they could have stream lined it a bit and knocked off a few minutes.the movie is also quite bleak,a bit too much,except for the very last scene.and as for the ending,i' found it a bit confusing,but maybe it's just me,me,because after checking the boards i noticed many people seemed to have the ending figured out.anyway i'll have to watch it again to see if i can figure out what i missed.overall,i'd give The Orphanage a 3.5/5"
5,C.R.A.Z.Y.,"I heard good things from another person about this movie so I had to see it for myself and I am glad I did. It is not so much a scary movie more like, mentally scary. This orphan girl plays the part great and is psychopath at least. Really great twists in the movie especially about the dwarfism. The orphan girl is very cunning and human emotion means nothing to her. The only thing I did not like is when the Dad died at the end."
2,"Works, but DVD Scratched, Doesn't snap into case","Got this on the cheap and used, so I wasn't expecting perfection. But while the DVD works, it is more scratched than I've ever seen a DVD be. May be due to the fact that when it came, it wasn't even secured inside the box. (Not snapped in.) I think this is due to the fact that the DVD doesn't fit into the box for some reason. Odd, I know, but it will not snap in and stay secure.Overall, DVD works okay, but really scratched up and I don't even put it in the box anymore."
4,Good movie,"Guillermo does nice work. My wife and I enjoyed this movie. If you like his other work, you should like this too."
3,Haunting and memorable story,"This film is very well done. The only reasons I didn't give it four stars are that it's too reminiscent of Dark Water and (the big one) I was spoiled by having seen Pan's Labyrinth before I saw this one.The film was beautifully done, the acting was very believable in most scenes, and it was a gripping story despite the fact horror movie fans won't find ""action"" in it. A significant part of the film was predictable, especially the ending, but I still enjoyed it for the beauty of the film itself.I don't speak Spanish, so I had to turn on English subtitles, but that detracted from the film very little. You could feel the emotion in the voices and expressions of the actors. I don't particularly like subtitled films, but Pan's Labyrinth and this one really won me over.Very well worth watching if you don't mind the subtitles or you speak Spanish and don't need them."
5,The Orphanage a Mus See Movie,"Ultimately it was the reviews that convinced me to watch this movie, and truth be told I have not regretted it. As I watched the movie part of me was waiting for the boogie man to come out from behind a dark corner or perhaps gallons of blood to begin oozing form walls or some other place, not unlike many Hollywood scary movies. But instead I was very pleasantly entertained. The entire movie was very engaging, it kept me on the edge of my seat, and ultimately I was completely taken by surprise with an ending I never saw coming. A very sad, tragic, and sobering drama with a very scary feel that did not disappoint.....I highly recommend it."
5,The Orphanage,"An excellent thriller with some truly frightening moments. The music score is appropriate and excellent. The 2.35:1 picture is enhanced, sharp, and crystal clear."
3,Ya still have to use a square,"Ya still have to use a square, plus, unless you have a router with soft start this thing will move on you. Built a 9 cubicle plywood bookshelf...after cutting all the parts using the optional story stick I discovered that nothing was square. Thanks to Bessey K body clamps and Titebond III I still managed to put a decent bookshelf together by applying brute force to the parts. This was purchased to be a replacement for my homemade rig. The homemade right angle saw/router guide was much less expensive and using a couple of bar clamps it never moved when I hit the ""on"" switch of my router."
5,Wonderful and bizarre,"This book is sort of bizarre. On the one hand it is a great cookbook with emphasis on techniques and little on ""recipes"". The upshot is that one might actually come to understand the techniques of Japanese cooking. It is also an interesting discussion of rural Japan.My only objection to the book is that the author seems both wrapped up in nostalga and aware of the trade value of nostalga to some of the audience reading the book.If you are looking for a good Japanese cookbook, I would recommend this _AND_ another, and eating at restaurants. The idea is that you can follow the directions in the other cookbook, but understand the issues of technique and/or philosophy from this one. The only catch is that you are less likely to get the sorts of things that this book discusses at restaurants."
3,"Beautiful book, but not what I expected","This is an impressively laid out book, with excellent photos and text about Japanese folk cooking. I find myself rarely using it, though, because to me the indexing and arrangement of the various types of dishes is a bit confusing and not so user friendly. Also, there are many ingredients that are hard to find (at least in Cincinnati). I suppose, though, that for those who are serious about authentic Japanese cooking, it is a very valuable source. It does offer many types of recipes, not just sushi, which I'm not that fond of. To me raw seafood might taste okay raw, but it's even better steamed or broiled."
2,mediocre,"The only good song on this cd was ""Its Probably Me"". The artist singing the music is not Sting and they do a mediocre choppy job of singing everything else. They totally ruined ""Desert Rose"". I've been listening to Sting and The Police for 23 years since I was 9 and I am a big fan, just not of this Tribute album."
4,Shipped in a 'HUGE' padded box....,"Go figure...Amazon leaves my expensive cookware and appliances in the original boxes to ship (so they arrive dented and 'dinged') and then packs this $11 cane into the largest padded box it has.Anyway, the cane is fine and appears quite sturdy. It adjusts to a person ranging in height from under 5' to over 6' too. My one small complaint is that the handle is both a little slick and shapped so that it will not hang from a knob or holder. Have noted it crashing to the floor more than once, and have only had the cane since yesterday."
3,good quality,This Henley shirt is of good quality & seems true to size. Can be worn for work or casual wear. I prefer the Carhart work henley as it seems more roomier & slightly more heavy fabric.(I do prefer the burgundy color compared to the Carhart port)
4,This has got to be the greatest Sally Harmon cd yet,"I have eight of Sallys' cds and this is by far her greatest cd yet. It seems that i liked most of the song selection on this particular cd. Also Sally did a marvelous job on her arrangments. You could tell a lot of effort went into making this such a great project.I think this cd will be one that will never tire the listner. I know that you can't paly Christmas music year round, but if you could, this would one of my favorite cds. I would try to wear it out.I Most Suredly Can Recommend This Cd"
2,This cd is just fair,"It is nothing to write home about, sorry I don't care for this artist or the way she delivers these songs, it's kind of boring really..."
3,Inside Your Outside,"The reason I don't give this book a higher rating is a few scientific inaccuracies. For instance, the brain is shown as grey, not pink. It also says that food stays in the stomach for days. In a healthy person the food goes through the entire digestive in about 24 hours.It irks me when books for children, especially science books, have such mistakes. It would be so easy to edit out these inaccuracies. There is no excuse for such carelessness."
4,Great book for our purpose,This is a really clever introduction to the basic anatomy and functioning of the human body. people at the Museum love to sit and read it.I didn't give this a perfect rating because there are a couple of less than accurate statements - but they are within the context of the book.
5,my 4 yr old daughter is fascinated with anatomy,"As with almost all Dr Seuss titles, he masterfully takes a college level subject and puts it into a kindergartner's world. He does so without leaving out or dumbing dumb- amazing. And as always the language is engaging through the rhyme and cadence. Added bonus is that it encourages my new reader to read on her own as well."
2,Okay for the under-6 crowd,"I got this video because my kids are really into insects. I was disappointed that they only featured twenty different insects, none of them in their natural habitat, and only a brief factoid about each. The voice-over was, I suppose, meant to be a mom chatting with her child about the bug on the screen, but often the voices were mumbled and indistinct. The camera work was low-quality and there were no really good close-ups. However, my kids enjoyed it and have asked to see it again (they are 7 and 9), so that counts for an extra star; I would only have given it one. Instead of this tape, you might want to opt for ""Microcosmos"" which is way cooler"
5,The Bible for Collectors of 18th Century English Bottles!,This book foccuses mainly on 17th and 18th century English bottles. It contains information that is invaluble to anyonewho collects or deals in 18th century bottles. There arealso small sections dealing with European bottles. The back contains a large section dealing with sealed bottles as well. This book is well worth whatever price one has to pay for it. I own two copies and would like to have three!
5,An excellent Book!,The New Girl is an excellent book! Mike Reynolds not only gets inside the psyche of a woman but also highlights changes in how society regards him because he is ostensibly female. As a woman I realize that society perceives me as inferior chiefly because I am not physically strong -- yet I know that strength has many meanings other than muscle power. I like the way Mike Reynolds emphasizes that men and women are human beings with common needs who should understand each other better--or at least try.
5,neat!,"What a neat concept for a book!After reading it I realized it took a lot of what ""Lisa"" didn't have to do the whole project. To plan to do this for 2 months, and then to actually do it, and pull it off, and learn things about ourselves, Wow.And sometimes I've felt the same thing, that it's how we project ourselves onto the world is how we'll be treated. I guess it goes not just for character, but for gender , also."
5,Wow!,"In the tradition of John Howard Griffin&#65533;s classic book, ""Black Like Me,"" Reynolds spent 24 hours a day in a different physical persona and wrote about the experience. But while Griffin transformed himself from Caucasian to African-American, Reynolds chose to become an unemployed, overweight, unmarried woman.Mike Reynolds not only gets inside the psyche of a woman but also highlights changes in how society regards him because he is ostensibly female. I like the way Mike Reynolds emphasizes that men and women are human beings with common needs who should understand each other better--or at least try."
5,WOW,"This pack has it all... I remember when I played ""pool of radience"" on my Apple ][ e. If you like roleplaying games will not so spectacular graphics...but a tight storyline ""unlike more sophisticated rpg's aka Baldor's Gate"" I think this is for you.."
2,A knife can work better,"I am reasonable adept with cutting mangoes and have found this particular device not as easy to use. Since mangoes have a pit that are wide from on one axis and shallow from the perpendicular axis, lining this up is really important. Many mangoes do not lend themselves easily to figuring out which axis is flat and which is shallow.A knife works much better for me."
1,not sure how it works,"It's a gift for my brother but I took a look and kinda explored it a little before giving it away and I can't see how it can cut the seed away because the blade seems so hard, not as flexible to cut around the seed, but then again, maybe it works wonders...I never tested it since it was a gift."
5,This is GREAT!,"I, too, was sceptical about how well this would work but I tried it last night and it's awesome. It slices the mango like a hot knife going through butter!My kids and I had a bet that it wouldn't work but we all were proved wrong and we all are glad that we were. I've told several people about this new tool before trying it and now I'm really going to rave - and take one with me to Maui for vacation too.Mango without slippery fingers = 5 STARS AND 100% yummy!"
2,Another useless toy,I bought this upon America's Test Kitchen recommendation but it only works for small or medium mangos and does not work for larger ones. A good peeler and knife work just fine. Another gadget that's gonna take some space in the kitchen without much benefit.
5,What a great idea!!!,Ever struggle with cutting up a mango? well struggle no more. This gadget does the trick.
5,Good Grips Mango Splitter is a must have!,"First of all, I want to express my great delight in receiving the product very quickly after I placed my order. Cudoos to the AMAZON shipping department! I had to make a mango and papaya chutney as part of an appetizer so it could not have come at a more opportune time. The OXO mango splitter made short work of removing the seeds from the 2 mangos. All that was left was to peel and chop! I would recommend this product to anyone!"
1,All Mango Pits do not fit !,The metal part does not flex so this is only good for mango pits that can fit. this simply will not work for most mangos
3,Not as easy as expected,Had difficulty lining it up correctly on the mango and it was difficult to push thru. Once I got it started it work great but it did make the end of the fruit squishy. I will keep using it though.
3,OXO good grips Mango splitter,Not too successful. The cutter should have a movable blade to accomodate larger Mango's with the large pits. It will likely work fine on the smaller yellow mangos and other small pitted fruit.
3,mango cutter,"This mango cutter is well made and easy to use. It cuts the mango around the seed, but is designed for mangoes that are larger than the ""champagne"" mangoes I love. Consequently, it doesn't cut close enough to the seed and require additional trimming to prevent waste. Maybe there is a smaller model designed for smaller seeds....other than that is works well and arrived in a timely fashion."
4,Pretty great gadget,"Wow! Gone is the mass of orange goo I used to end up with when trying to get the flesh off a mango. And if you peel the mango prior to using this, you don't have to slice it off the skin at all, it's ready to go. There IS a bit still left on the seed, which provides a quick snack."
1,Mango Splitter,This item does NOT do the job it is meant to do. I gave it 3 or 4 tries and each time it just made a mess. Sent it back for a refund!
3,Need more practice,"Great idea, Good price, but so far have only been toatally successful on one mango. I will keep trying."
4,Mango Splitting 101,"At first look, we weren't sure it would work w/all sizes of mangos...but incredibly enough...it does! ~ Do not recommend trying to use on very ripemangos tho- (do those by hand)...but ez & quick...worth buying if you do lots of mangos...u can use this tool to pare them into slices to ripen faster as well..."
2,Wrong size - pits vary,"All Mango pits are different sizes and are hard. So the fixed cutters will either leave too much fruit on the nut, or get stopped by the nut.Furthermore pushing hard will mush the fruit.A sharp knife is so much more flexible, in cutting the fruit off the nut.I use a 6"" utility knife and cut two large peices off parallel ot nut and two smaller pieces off perpendicular to nut.I love OXO but returning this splitter."
1,"Good idea, not a great tool.","Gave this a try last time I made mango salsa...it's simple enough, but it takes longer to line up the tool and push down than to make 2 cuts with a chef's knife.In theory, the contoured blade saves more flesh off the edges of the pit; depending on the size/shape of each pit and the ripeness of the fruit, though, the tool leaves too much behind on the sides of the pit, and gives the split halves a ragged, concave shape.A sharp chef's knife is a faster, neater tool for mangos--and takes up less space in the drawer."
2,NOT WORTH THE SPACE,"Works great for the 15-20% of mangos that meet the right size and ripeness criteria -- makes a mangle of the rest. With a little practice, you can peel a mango with much less waste in just a bit more time. Very ungainly to store, takes up a surprising amount of space. A classic kitchen gadget -- clever idea, not worth much."
3,The bottom of ripe fruit turns to mush,"I was hoping this tool would make my new favorite fruit a cinch to deal with -- however, when I use it with a ripe mango that is not firm, the pressure of bearing down on the tool turns the bottom of the fruit to mush. So about a quarter of the fruit does not look very appealing, and is not usable if you are dicing the mango for a salsa. Also, after only four or five uses, the blades are not sharp enough to pierce the skin, I have to use a knife to slice little starter slits and then use the tool. Great idea for a tool, Oxo just needs to keep perfecting it..."
5,no hassel,Unique tool that take the hassel out of getting the fruit out. It's fun to use and works as advertised
2,If only it worked...,"After reading all the positive reviews, I was hopeful that this gadget would allow me to satisfy my customers by adding typically unweildy mangoes to my catering menu. (I generally shy away from them because of the time it takes to prepare...)Much to my chagrin, this cutter just doesn't, well, cut it. Makes absolute mush out of all but the firmest mangoes. The problem is not with the cutter, so much as the mango, itself. If nature made a mango with a uniformly-sized and -placed pit, the cutter would work beautifully. Rarely are pits centered perfectly in the fruit, so the blades of the cutter run into the pit, rather than slice around it most of the time. Alas, Mother Nature is unpredictable, as will be your results with this cutter."
4,Handy product,Does the job once you correctly position the mango. Handier than trying to hold and slice around the pit with a knife.
4,Works good enough,Works good enough. I had one where the seed was too big but it started me off so I just took a knife and sliced along the bottom 1/2 of the seed. It's quick and easy.
1,Waste of money!,I really like OXO products but this is the first one that I think is a waste of money. I got it as a gift because everyone knows that I love mangoes but all pits are not the same size. Honestly it's a good concept but wasn't thought out. It's so easy to cut the fruit using a large knife and then use a paring knife to get the fruit off of the skin. If this actually worked it would still take longer than the usual knife method anyway. Don't waste your money!
2,So So Performance,"I love to eat mangos so when I saw this I thought umm, this might be a fun tool to add to my kitchen. After testing it out a few times I decided its not that great because if the mango is not really firm you end up crushing the bottom of the fruit, if the seed is not just alligned with the blades then they get stuck and you have to re set them. I prefer to peel the mango then slice it off of the seed this give me the best restults and least wastage."
1,It doesn't work,"This tool doesn't work. It mashes the fruit instead of cutting it. If the mango was able to stand up to this cutter, it would be too green to eat. Save your money and use a sharp knife."
4,Mango tango,"Finally! A reasonable way to deal with mangos. Love them, hate getting the flesh off. This gizmo makes that a snap on MOST mangos; some have seeds a bit larger than the unit allows for, and it will merely squish an overripe mango at the bottom, but 4 out of 5 mangos agree: this device is truely a convenience. Nice and hefty, with (ha!) good grips."
2,So close and yet so far!,"This is a great idea that wasn't thought through (or tested enough) by Oxo! The problem (that could be easily corrected) is that the blades are simply not sharp enough (right from the beginning!) The blades won't pierce the skin (I have use a knife to start the cuts) and then, as others have observed, if the mango is truly ripe (soft), as the blade is forced down through the tough skin (a mango skin is always tough!), it just mashes the lower part of the fruit. I still use it because it's easier than a peeler and a knife when I eat the mango right out of the skin leaning over the sink, but for any other purpose when you would like nice cuts of fruit, this is a failure."
4,Great kitchen device,We like mangos a lot. This splitter has made it a lot easier and faster to serve up the mangos for breakfast. Works quite well
2,Good idea gone wrong,"I've used this product several times and have yet to find a mango with a pit small enough to to fit through the splitter. That's a fatal flaw. If you happened to find a small enough mango you would still have to find a way to anchor or balance it on end while you shoved the splitter through the fruit. That probably won't happen if you've peeled the mango or have not correctly determined the orientation of the oblong pit. So, at the very least, the fruit must be small and unpeeled if you're to stand a chance using this product successfully."
2,Bulky,"This is really bulky and not worth the space it takes up. It doesn't work for very large mangoes because they don't fit through and it doesn't work for very small mangoes because it leaves too much on the pit. And forget using it on a ripe mango, it will squash it and have juices running everywhere."
1,Doesn't do it,"Gave it a shot but it simply mashes the mango; at no point has it made much of an inroad on any mango that it has encountered. The knife edges aren't particularly sharp, either. Avoid this and keep hoping for an easy way to get at mangoes."
1,"If I wanted to smoosh my mango into the counter, I could do it with my hand.","All this does is crush the mango into my counter-top. I think this is probably the most useless tool in my kitchen. Which is disappointing, because I can't cut a mango to save my life."
2,Concept is good,"The concept is great provided that all mango pits are the same size, that the mango is really ripe, and that the skin can be cut without a true blade. The two we tried it on were mush by the time we were through."
1,Not a good buy,"I can't figure out how to get it even with the seed. Too much waste. My kids eat lots of mangos, but it turns out it's easier just to slice them up."
1,worst oxo product I ever bought,Save your money. This is the worst Oxo product. Mine was so dull that it made a mushy mess out of the mango. Much faster to use a knife and yields much more fruit. Save your drawer space for tools that actually work.
4,A must have for the mango lover,"If you have more than one or two mangos a year, this cutter is a great find."
5,A tremendous invention,"This thing works fantastically. Goes through ripe mangoes like butta. In SoFla, during mango season, this is a must-have. Can see tthat the dull blade thing would be an issue, but so far so good."
5,Does the job,"I can't tell you how many times I've let mangoes rot in my refrigerator because I didn't want to go through the hassle involved in eating them. This gadget is exactly what I needed to make it easy to get the pit out of the mango. It's true that the pressure squashes the mango and creates juice on the cutting board, but that's nothing compared to just leaving them rot."
2,Not sharp enough!,Although the handle seems decently sturdy the cutting blade on this tool was near-useless after the first few uses. Definitely NOT sharp enough to cut through the mangoes I buy on a very regular basis. Will go back to using a knife.
1,This product sucks!,"I was very excited to get this mango splitter until I tried to use it. I made certain I had the ""blade"" side to the mango and when pressing down, it didn't even penetrate the skin. The more pressure that was applied, only turned the entire mango to mush on the bottom, losing all the great juice. ended up getting out my trustworthy knife and cutting it the traditional way. This iten is a big waste of money."
5,love the beast,"Without a doubt, the best ""car guy"" movie ever. It explains the psychology of why some guys like old cars, and can spend lots of time driving, fixing, and restoring them. The interviews with the three guests are the best part of the film. I recommend watching this with your spouse or girlfriend. It will help them understand our attraction to cars."
5,Love The Beast (USA - Two Disc Special Edition),"Great true life story and produced well. Delivered on time, without any issues or concerns. Thanks!"
3,Every viewer is entitled on own opinion,"Every man has got a secret.It is such a stable one's libido at a fast car modernised and advanced since Eric Bana The Aussie-actor-in-Hollywood had his stuff acquired at a teen age of fifteen (seventeen, according to father of him???), that movie looksquite sexyand surprisingly entertaining if even a viewer had gained only the feeling of seeing a top-class advertisement of big fast American second-hand vehicles.A reviewer keeps more in shop regarding family disclosed/car accident moments filmed meticulously because every viewer is entitled on own opinion of anything."
4,Good documentary movie,"A very good movie for the true car enthusiast or race enthusiast (or restorer/enthusiast of anything). Not your typical superficial car-guy flick. The beginning is a little slow, but, give it a chance - worth the watch."
5,"Car Girl + Bana Fan = Must-see, no-brainer!","As a long-time fan of muscle cars, and Eric Bana, I'm surprised I took as long as I did to see this... But not at all surprised that I found it funny and interesting. Eric has always seemed more 'real' to me, than other celebs, and this is an enjoyable watch, partly (in my opinion) due to his humor and guy-next-door charm... If you love cars, or you admire Mr. Bana, this is worth a watch! :)"
2,Gor boring,Didn't make any sence to me. Cars flip over and had no control in how it did maybe I didn't give it enough time but I got bored with it.
3,Beginning Primer,"This book is a fast read and a good introduction to Lean and the Kaizen Event. It covers all of the basics and enough detail to present a sound and solid beginning to anyone looking to understand Lean and Kaizen. If you are looking for solid meat beyond the basics, you need to go elsewhere. The book points you to other sources through out the text."
1,Deserves Zero Stars,"My wife and I enjoy watching the YouTube re-runs of ""What's My Line,"" and sometimes to amuse ourselves, one of us will make up a career to be guessed while the other tries to figure it out. This game offers absolutely zero over our guessing game. The game does provide a list of sample careers, but that would only be useful if you were devoid of any imagination of your own. The game also provides a set of photos to stand for the person whose career you are guessing, but since you can arbitrarily match the photo to the career, the picture offers you no information to aid in your guessing. And finally, the game provides a counting wheel to keep track of the number of incorrect guesses, only useful for those lacking the ability to keep track using their fingers. The only redeeming value to our purchase was the good laugh we got when we discovered how stupid it was. I might also add that the game is durable, as it seems to be holding up rather well as it sits in our closet."
4,Double Your Pleasure,"I bought this as a monitor for my home office, thinking I'd use the TV tuner as a PIP (picture-in-picture) image while working. So far it hasn't gotten to my desk! I first set it up as a TV in the bedroom, just to be sure it worked. It is a great little TV! Then it went on the kitchen counter. So much better than a big boxy TV taking-up a lot of space. I want at least one more of these! Two minor issues: the sound is a bit tinny from the small built-in speakers (turning up the Bass setting helped.), and the on-screen controls are hard to read from more than a couple feet away. (The optional captions are larger and easy to see.)"
5,Great as a TV,"We use this as our kitchen TV. It takes up a fraction of the space as our 13"" TV did and has a larger viewing area. It has a great picture and works well with the VCR as well. Very happy with this product. Haven't tried it as a monitor but seems as though it would be great."
1,don't buy refurbished,"I purchased a refurbished version of this item and while it works most of the time, the sometimes that it doesn't are very irritating. Because it is refurbished, no refund, thanks Samsung, appreciate that. I bought it based on it's high ratings, but perhaps I should have gotten a new one.While watching the TV mode of the screen, the sound will occasionally cut out, leading me to trying to turn it up which sometimes works. Other times I just have to turn it off for a few hours.Sometimes the screen just turns off all together, or goes into a power save mode while I am working! I remember to save my work constantly so that not all is lost.And the remote doesn't work properly. Some keys work.I regret having paid for this unsatisfactory box with buttons, however lightweight it may be. It doesn't come with wall mounts either, those are $40 to $100 elsewhere."
4,"Affordable, attractive product for hiding cords","The Belkin hide away cord concealer works well for hiding speaker wires running along a wall. The price per foot is very reasonable and the finished product looks good. The only downside with this product is that it comes rolled up (picture a roll of 3 inch wide masking tape), and you have to first unroll the plastic and then form into a rectangular tube. Be sure to cut to length, then stick to the wall, then run the wires through, and then, as the last step, seal the tube shut."
3,Its ok...,"This cord concealer worked well for about a month, but then started to fall off my wall.. I have 3 cords in it.The cord concealer also had started to tear at the bottom where cords meet the extension cord.So now I'm looking for a new one.I only recommend this to someone needing one cord concealed, and hopefully it wont fall after a month for them.."
4,nice cord consealer,this item worked fine to assist in consealing the wiring from my hdtv. i spray painted a sectionto conform to my existing wall and it looks very good. i do worry about its removal when i needto relocate my tv.
5,Very impressed!,"There is a saying 'better late than never!', so I'm writing this review. I just borrowed this book from the library looking for a way to understand classes, constructors and destructors, and fortunately I found them here in this book! I esp. like chapter 3 & 4, and I bought my own copy from Amazon as I am very pleased!I hope Mr.Jamsa will follow this up with another for Visual Basic 2005 or 2008."
5,Awesome stuff,"I was fortunate to catch Speed Mcqueen on several occasions at CBGB's. Just awesome. Don't know what ever happened to the band, but i've been listening to 'Gig' since. Gotta give my props when due...great stuff. Loved by Millions."
5,Fascinating Look At One's Of Europe's Hidden Obsessions,"Umberto Eco has done a very fine job of cataloguing and elucidating Europe's historical search for the ""perfect language"". What is interesting is how he embeds the historical stages of the different definitions of ""perfect language"" into this book. Medieval Europe begins with a notion of a language in perfection spoken by Adam and passed down until the breakup at the Tower of Babel; then when it becomes apparent that no such language can be found, Renaissance philosophers take up attempts at finding a common root to all languages in order to help with religious conversions, missions, economy & trade; and finally, in our global community, efforts are being made to standardize certain linguistic derivatives in order to aid the advance of science and intergovernmental interactions. This book should be read by anyone interested in linguistics or European history in general."
5,Excellent book!,"The ideas in this book makes you long for the ""magic meadow"" which Brick, Princess, Charlie Pill, Diz Dobie, and Mrs. Jackson find them magically transported to. A delight to read! You will read it over and over; and retain Alexander Key's vision."
5,Good Collection of Great Articles,"This is a collection of beginner-oriented articles from Garden Railroading magazine. This is not a single ""how-to"" source as much as it is a source of encouragement. It is also a great companion to Allan Miller's book, as it fills in some of the (admittedly small) gaps and shows a few alternative ways to accomplish things. Many people appreciate the great photos, which also appeared in Garden Railways magazine at one time. Authors include Jack Verducci, Pat Hayward, Marc Horovitz, Kevin Strong and many other best-known writers on the subject of Garden Railroading.-Paul Race, editor for Family Garden Trains (tm)"
2,Not full length songs,Just got this 3 set (CDs). (March 2005). Rip off if you are expecting full length songs....
1,Insult To The 60's,"The Sixties was a time of great music, album rock, free form FM Radio; like the great KSAN of San Francisco. It was not a time of chopped, sliced, and diced single versions of songs. This disgraceful compilation has 59 songs, 56 of which are the edited singles. Public television created this travesty as a ""thank you"" gift for one of their endless, obnoxious, pledge breaks.If you want to truly ""experience"" the 60's, buy some of the great LP's/CDs from that time.I've donated my ""60's Rock Experience"" to the library.Peace"
4,"Good, but missing some tunes that would make it great","Very good, but certain songs are missing--lesser hit songs are featured, but thebiggest hits are left out"
1,Doesn't play on US blu ray players,"Why does Amazon's US web site offer European versions on an opera (Rigoletto) that won't play on a US machine? Why is there such a difference in price between the US version and the European version of the same opera? If you buy the $8.99 version of Rigoletto, make sure you have a blu ray player that plays European blu ray disks."
3,"If they're not having fun, how can we?","The photography and scenery are vivid and attractive. The orchestra is fine, the singers are talented and on pitch. But no one is having any fun. That is the unfortunate look and feel of this production. Elena Mosuc, especially, looks put out having to suffer through curtain call. This production illustrates how many elements must come together for art to succeed."
2,No Subtitles on Blu-Ray,"According to Amazon there is supposed to be several options for subtitles and audio options on this Blu-ray of Rigoletto but when I put the disc in my player, there were only two options, ""play opera"" and ""trailer."" I could not get any subtitles or audio options on my Samsung Blu-ray player. Because of the lack of audio options, the sound was muddy and bass heavy.The performance was fine but the staging was nothing special. Because of these problems, I cannot recommend this version of ""Rigoletto."" Maybe it's a problem with my Blu-ray player but I have other opera Blu-ray discs that work fine, so I am assuming it is a problem with the disc."
2,Not their best,American Classics is not the best cookbook that Cook's Illustrated has put out. It may be interesting to know why you should do some of the things that they recommend in a recipe but you could get the same or better information from a stalwart like Joy of Cooking not to mention MORE recipes. In fact some of these recipes are just updated JOY recipes and I don't that the update is really a marked improvement.There just is nothing substantial in here. Fannie Farmer & Joy of Cooking are much better and more complete. Saveur does American is better if indeed all you want is Classic American recipes. If you are looking for an intro book by the Cook's crowd try the Yellow Schoolhouse book.
5,Loved it!,"I bought this book for my brother and instead of wrapping it, I read it during the three hour trip to his house. He almost didn't get it! It has so many great ideas in it even for someone like me who has been cooking a long time. Buy this for the foodie in your life!"
2,More of the same.,"I agree with the reader from California. I treat Cook's Illustrated as gospel, and use only Cook's recipes. I bought The Best Recipe, I bought Soups and Stews, and Grilling. I ordered American Classics with The America's Test Kitchen book, and upon opening both books, I discovered that they're just full of repeats. Granted, this book had less than the ATK book but I became a little fed up and returned both books. It seemed as though I was paying for a Boston Baked Beans recipe. Maybe I'll give this book another chance."
4,Interesting American Recipes for Brits- and Americans,"I spent time in the States when younger, and some things that I ate were a little eclectic for British Tastes. However, when I saw this book reviewed in the British press, I knew it would have all the recipes I would need. I wasn't wrong! Not many pictures, but clear, concise instructions, and reading it has made my tummy rumble! Can't wait to try the stuffing recipes - so much different to British stuffing, and the Coca-cola glazed Ham. This will keep me busy for ages!"
3,If you feel homicidal...,"...you should consult a psychiatrist. Carmageddon is perhaps the closest game to the ones the anti-violence groups decry. To say that it has questionable content is a gross understatement. There is blood, gore, and you get points for squashing people with your car. The language is vulgar and caustic. If you play this game to ""blow off your steam"" and you imagine your boss, or professor in place of one of the poor victims, I hope you don't live too close to me.However, if you play this game for the fun factor of high-risk driving rather than murderous instincts, you will discover a very potent racing game. The cars, parts, and other options are numerous and the objectives require great precision and accuracy. Try this game out if there is no one around who may be offended by the profanity your computer will spew into the air."
5,"Challenging, Important and FUN","Michael Gross' book Starstruck is an extraordinary compendium of not only his own experiences as a fan, but serves as a unique and important analysis of the world of celebrity. At a time when we are saturated with entertainment culture, Gross manages to lift back the veil on this unique late 20th century phenomenon to explore both the personal and the political consequences of our collective obsession with fame. From poignant and hilarious stories of his own crazy desire to be near the famous - his boyhood letters to Ronald Reagan are priceless - to his adult understanding of those who have dedicated their lives to famous people - Dolly Parton fans in particular - Gross's authorial voice is both critical and sympathetic at the same time. This book is original, engaging, and utterly compelling. A great read for those of us who flip through grocery market tabloids and those of us interested in a more serious look at cultural politics. Five stars!"
2,No instructions,I like the product but I feel that the manufacturer should include instructions on how to use the product and how to attach the extra wide jaws that are sold separately.
5,Fine tool,"Before buying this, I used a straight edge I had bought at a lumber yard, which could be made to reach 8'. But I had to use clamps to hold it in place and sometimes the clamps interfered with my saw or the surface I was working on. This tool has that incorporated into the straight edge, making it take up less room for storage or use. I like that it reaches across a 4' sheet of plywood also, which allows me to cut a very straight line with a circular saw."
3,Great clamp and starter guide rail,"I purchased this clamp to use with my craftsman circular saw about a year before moving up to the Festool TS55. While this clamp is no Festool it is a great way to get started for someone on a tight budget or with few tools in their arsenal. The clamp works reasonably well with the circular saw plate, but you will need to take care to ensure that the clamp lays square to whatever piece you are cutting. Once set up it works pretty well. It certainly does a far superior job then using a circular saw with no guide. While better options exist, the all-in-one clamp is hard to beat for the price. Even after getting my Festool I still use this for some clamping applications."
5,Useful tool,I have used this tool at least 5 times and found it extremely useful. I used with the additional fixtures and without them. Using the right touch with this clamp and it will not flex. I had no problem whatsoever with the clamp flexing. I recommend this item as a useful tool for your workshop.
3,Good but not what I expected,"I was expecting this product to cut accurate right angles or atleast close to it. This is no different from using straight edge with quick grips. It doesn't save you time. I purchased this and used it for an entire day then left it collecting dust. I found a better way of cutting large sheets on youtube using two pieces of MDF, one narrow and one wide (so that it's flush with the factory edge). This product is a good idea, but definitely needs more inovation."
1,Save your money,"I bought this in addition to the wide jaw accessory clamps. I fought with it and got it to work a couple of times, however it's not in the least self-squaring, even with the ""wide jaws"". I added 8"" sections of hardwood to the wide jaws in order to increase the width of the clamping surface and that was a marginal improvement at best. Unfortunately it's still prone to shifting on you even when it feels like you've really snugged it up. Finally I was using it today and the movable side refused to slide smoothly or actually engage to clamp at all. I'm now back to using a quality level and clamps as my straight edge. Faster to set up and it doesn't slip.After four mediocre uses of it and one total failure, in addition to it making me recut and replace two fair sized pieces of walnut because of it slipping, this is going out with my recycling."
2,Looks like it would be a nice accessory but...,"...mine arrived with a permanent bow that prevents it from laying flat on a workpiece. That means I have to rig another clamping solution to hold it down (flat). As others mention, it flexes under moderate lateral pressure. My 98"" aluminum edge guide ($20 from Ace Hardware) is superior for routing and cutting, although it does not provide the T-slots. Bought this in July 2007 from Amazon, tried it three times, and now it hangs unused in a corner. I may re-purpose it (screwed down) for it's long T-slots, but never again as a routing edge. OK, I'll say something nice: the blue color is pretty."
2,An OK product,"I do alot of dado cutting with a router and have used a straight edge of red oak with two clamps as a guide. I saw this product and thought wow this would eliminate tha clampting and it would be self sqauring thus minimize time for measuring. Not so! The product does not self square despite what you would think so if you do not take care in how you position ( measure both ends of dado ) you will get off sqaure cuts. Also, I tried working with it on 3/4 inch plywood bookcases I was making for a client and on four of five tries when I pushed router against straight edge it moved. I am back to the red oak straight edge for this project.One more note, I thought by getting the 50 incher that I would have more flexibity, but on short pieces like 12 and 15 inch wide plywood be careful you need to brace the Clamp or the long end will pull your work up.Maybe I will conquer getting the clamping action to work, but in my opinion it is not a time saver."
1,"Not precision, nor square at all. Keep looking.","Unless I'm doing something wrong, this clamping guide isn't all it's made out to be.Here's my story: I already have a very nice table saw that has rails long enough to cut a full sheet of plywood in half, though that doesn't mean it's something that I like to do while I'm alone. That being said, I like to use the circular saw to make the panels more manageable in size before putting them on the table saw. This guide will certainly do this, but don't expect your cuts be to square. I even bought longer 'guide feet' (not sure what to call them), which are supposed to create a larger surface to square against, and this too doesn't really help.[...]If you're going to use a clamping system you should be able to have precision and accuracy when cutting and this doesn't fulfill the promises of the manufacturer. Good luck."
3,Great clamp - but,"Great clamp, but do not use it with a router. This is a great clamp for doing quick and dirty cuts, but do not expect your cut to be perfectly straight as it can flex if you apply pressure against it. It is perfectly fine for most circular saw cuts as long as you don't press to firmly against it, but a router adds way to much pressure and you won't end up with a straight cut. Get the wider model if you need it for routing or extremely straight circular saw cuts."
3,The author has real talent,"The author has real writing ability; I can't stress this strongly enough. She has what they call: ""Turn of phrase."" But the running internal monologue of Maud, the main character, got old after the first half.On the positive side, I liked all the characters, and lots of the vignettes were believable when thinking about small-town life. But a bunch of vignettes strung together didn't make a workable book for me. The theme of The Muse lost and The Muse found wasn't strong enough to carry the book.I would be very interested in reading other work by this author, whose talent is not in question."
4,The Genesis of An Enlightenment Document,"As is well known, or should be well known, the American Declaration of Independence is a classic 18th century Enlightenment document. Professor Wills has gone through his paces in order to evaluate virtually every possible idea that might have influenced Thomas Jefferson (and the other committeemen who worked on the document) as they put together not only a list of grievances but set the framework for a republican government. Wills looks at the Declaration as a revolutionary charter, a scientific paper, a moral paper, a sentimental paper (in the 18th century sense of the word) and finally as a national symbol. I would argue that in some cases the good professor has overdone it, especially on the influences of the scientific revolution but overall he does a creditable job for those who are more than general readers but less than specialists on the document, the Enlightenment or this period of American History. This book is not for amateurs."
2,should be just chex,"the chex mix bold party bag was not really a mix at all. it was just Chex with almost none of anything else. the people at the Chex company should fire their chex mixers, and replace. All it was was Chex and a pretzel or two every so often. whats this also about ""bold"" party mix? this mix was mild at best. the bold is just false advertising. also it being party mix means i can only have it 1 out of 365 days, and at the occasional friends birthday. so why buy a 12 pack? other than that its great."
1,No more seasoning. Mostly pretzels,"I've been eating Chex Mix for over a decade. It's been a slow decline from a great product to one that Betty Crocker should be ashamed of. I now find myself searching for the random over-seasoned chex for a little flavor and end up throwing away 30 pretzels because apparently that's all Chex Mix is now. It's very condescending that Betty Crocker thinks people can't notice the decline in quality. Taste of Worcestshire Sauce? Not even close. Bland, bland, bland."
1,Not same,"The picture you are showing is the original bold party blend. The new one is different, tastes different and has different ingredients. This was the only reason I asked for this one. You giving a different product. Dissapointed!"
2,Not so BOLD anymore,I used to love the Bold Party Blend when it was the same mix pictured on the old packaging they have on Amazon.Now they've reduced the flavor (it has to have at least half the intensity it used to have) and removed the round crackers--which were fantastic with the Bold Party Blend seasoning.Why mess with a good thing? I would have given the old version 5-stars. It *was* that good.
5,Chex Mix + magic pixie dust = Bliss,"I never thought I'd be reviewing snack food, but ZOMG how much do I love the Bold Party Blend Chex Mix! You know how at the bottom of a bag of regular Chex Mix you'll find that Chex piece that has been super-saturated with all of the seasonings and magic pixie dust they put in there? That's how every piece of Bold Party Blend Chex Mix tastes. So freaking good and so addictive.Yes, they changed the formula recently (substituting ingredients and dialing down the intensity of the flavor), but this is still the snack food of the gods. A bag of this stuff will definitely ruin you for regular Chex Mix, not to mention just about every other kind of snack food.Oh, and the super-saturated Chex pieces at the bottom of the Bold Party Blend bag...sheer awesomeness."
3,again. mis sorted into Gluten Free and it is NOT,"Sorry for marking so many of these today, but as a newly diagnosed wheat allergy and serious avoider, it bugs me that so many items are slipping through and being shown as gluten free when it's not."
4,Got here.,It got here. It was new and in the package. It didn't take too long and it was cheap so worth it.
5,a must see...,"An insightful and personal look at the lives of Colombian teens caught up in a local war for territory and power. Beautifully shot and edited, it is a must see if you are interested in any topics concerning Latin America, Colombia, drug wars, gangs etc..."
2,Oxford History of The Roman World,Disapointing. Too little history and too much culture. Writing also not up to ususal Brit quality
5,Beautiful,The black and white marble chess set was a great gift to give and it was in great condition when I got it.
5,Great Chess Set,"Very nice chess set. The pieces are all solid, nice looking, the board is large and its just fun playing chess on it after using a little plastic cheapy. its also a good centerpiece in the living room, and it arrived quickly and in perfect condition.... five stars, thumbs up. i emailed the company about a shipping question and they responded right away and were very friendly."
3,Good deal if you need a portable A/C,"Consumer Reports says this portable air conditioner is much less efficient than a comparable window unit. It's definitely more expensive than a window air conditioner (probably at least double the cost); you're paying for appearance and convenience, not functionality. (It's easy to disconnect this unit and roll it away into a corner or closet.)I bought two of these for two rooms with sliding casement windows that posed problems for window units -- and I didn't want to bother with installing and then removing bulky window units every season. One of the rooms is a very large bedroom with a cathedral ceiling, and the Frigidaire portable air conditioner has no problem keeping it cool. Your options for placing the unit are rather limited -- there is a somewhat flexible duct that must be run from the back of the unit to a window (or a hole through an exterior wall), and you also need a nearby electrical outlet, preferably on an isolated circuit."
2,Defective - noisy - doesn't cool 9000 BTU worth,"I needed an air conditioner for an odd sized window, and thought this unit might be my answer. Sadly, it was not. For a month, I was pleased. I questioned the ""9,000 BTU"" rating outside of a lab, since less-than-perfect heat venting lowers efficiency, but - hey! - it cooled my bedroom. Then, the noise started. The decibels rose until I was unable to talk on the telephone without shouting, much less sleep. When the unit quit completely, the mystery was solved. The internal pump which ejects condensation through a hose had failed. The compressor iced, the fan banged against the ice. Now Frigidaire can't seem to come up with either a replacement unit, or parts. Bottom line - bad design. Better than De Longhi, but still bad. This is an great idea whose time has NOT come, until they get the bugs out."
1,Don't Buy This A/C!,"I purchased this A/C on 5/25/09. It completely stopped working a few weeks ago--almost exactly 2 years after I bought it. Repairman said the compressor went. I have never had any appliance last only two years. In fact I have a Friedrich A/C in my Living Room that's over 20 years old and still working fine (I know, now that I typed that it will break tomorrow!). BTW I am curious about the good reviews for this A/C, as most of the positive comments were written right after purchase. I wonder if the reviewers still feel this way after some time has passed.I am totally disgusted with this product and recommend you run, not walk away from it. I feel like I threw over $300 away on this horrible piece of equipment."
2,Fridgidaire Portable Air Conditioner,"The 9,000BTU Fridgidaire portable air conditioner that I bought makes an audible buzzing sound during cooling. This is the only complaint I have. I sleep normally but a persistent buzz will annoy me and makes it hard for me to go to sleep. It cools well but that buzz leads me to not recommend this product. Does anybody else have this problem and if so, what did they do about the buzz?"
1,poorly designed and missing parts,Purchased this AC model and had crucial parts missing preventing it's use during a heat wave. All stores were out of the model and the appliance support stores were closed on the weekend. Needless to say we will not buy a frigidaire appliance again and now have a useless model with a poor design and missing parts. buyer beware. Check your box before leaving the store where you purchase these AC's as returning them is difficult due to the size and the weight of the box.During a heat wave the models are sold out and reaching frigidaire service person is difficult at best but impossible on the weekend.
2,Not As Effective As Sugar Water,Save your money. Sugar and water (boiled) will work better than this mix. The red coloring doesn't seem to make any difference for attracting hummingbirds.
2,not my favorite,This is not my favorite Cartier scent. The bottle is heavy not practical for travel. The scent dose not last (at least on me)
1,It seems like a glass of water,It was suppossed to be a gift for my mom and when she tried it for the first time.. NO SMELL.. like a glass of water.we are both totally dissapointed.
3,Not very happy...,"When I received the product it had leaked in the carton. The product does not seem ""fresh"". I have bought the product in a deptartment store before and this just does not quite smell the same. I am not very happy with my purchase."
1,Does not smell like the actual product,My spray nozzel was broken and the perfume has a strong alcohol smell. It does not smell like the actual product I ended up purchasing from a dept store.
1,Never received,I was terribly disappointed that I ordered this product from Amazon. I ordered a bottle for my daughter's birthday and ordered a bottle for my self as well. I ordered the product on February 7th and still had not received the product or any notification from Amazon on March 1st. I finally had to track down a customer service person (which was not easy) and they didn't know where the product was either. They said that they would credit my account and that was about the end of it. No real apology for having missed my daughter's birthday or what happened. I don't think I will use amazon again.Delices De Cartier By Cartier For Women. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 oz
2,Smells like old lady,This smells like like old lady....this is very different than the store. I would not buy this again or recommend. Amazon still rocks! Just don't like the product.
3,Not a fan,"For a men's scent, this would be okay, but it's a bit too masculine for a woman, in my opinion. My husband asked me why I felt compelled to wear men's cologne. Not good. Ladies, pass this one up. Guys, it's all on you."
5,GREAT I LOVE THIS PRODUCT,This was sent very fast to me. The price was AWESOME. I wear it all the time and all my friends were jealous. Everything about this purchase was a success. Please I totally recommend this to anyone. The smell of the perfume is intoxicating and Sexy!Thanks!
5,the broadway aerobic workout,"Best workout ever!! This is a great workout for both men and women! The VHS showing Candace leading floor exercises is very effective for toning and losing weight. You'll notice results in 2 weeks. The exercises themselves, once learned, take about 10 min. to do. Candace shows you how to rest during exercising if you can't keep up with each repetition. The floor exercises are low-impact. Within a month, you will be so toned and will have lost in dress and pants sizes. Great for women who have had a baby and want to get back in shape, once the doctor gives permission to exercise. This will do it! I know the routine by memory now."
2,They can do better,"I'm one of those people who grew up playing the original Wizardry (Proving Ground of the Mad Overlord) and wanted to have to same thing on my IBM computer. I was really disappointed because the graphics were worse than the old apple version, i can't figure out how they could do that but they did. Overall it was more difficult to use and just didn't have the same mystique that the original apple version possessed. The CD i bought didn't come with any instructions or anything so i didn't figure out how to play the other game so i can't comment there. I wouldn't go looking for this disc unless you liked the entire series. Fortunate for me i still have a working Apple II GS so i can play the original Wizardry."
1,Useless Feather Board,"As sold, this feather board cannot be easily implemented to either table saw or routing table use. There are no packaged instructions and no clear cut intuitive installation of this product. It appears that it may be an accessory for another product, but there is no mention of this."
4,Good gift,I gave these to my Dad as a gift. I think he liked them. Hopefully he is using them but he's probably collecting them.
3,color,The Melanzane sandals are more purple than the brown I thought they were. They are still nice just not the color I expected but I'll still be able find something to wear with them!
3,Mis-marketed,The product was marketed as a Delta product. It is not but rather a secondary market replacement without any brand.
1,"Very accurate, when it works","Arrived with a dead battery which should have been a tip-off that it eats through batteries--batteries which cost 20% of the thermometer's price. I've replaced the battery twice after using it only once each time, and now I will be replacing the thermometer. Really disappointing."
5,Great Product,Great product. Works very well. I find it invaluable with my kitchen and grilling activities. I find it very accurate also. Recommend it to anyone who would like a quick read thermometer.
2,Good idea - but sure has battery problems.,I just got it (or should I say them) so I'm not sure how it'll hold up.But the first one I ordered came totally dead. So I exchanged it (Amazon is great for returns/exchanges by the way).So the new one came. Also dead.I'm sure Amazon would have exchanged it too - but I lost patience and went out and bought a battery - which was all that was wrong.The producet itself seems fine - but I don't know why they are going out with dead batteries. I think another reviewer mentioned a battery issue. Hmm.
1,Cheap junk,"I have three high end aluminum hard guncases and decided to pick this one up as an inexpensive gift for one of my hunting partners. While it is a sturdy looking case, it has a huge design flaw. The back seam is held together with just a couple of cheap pop rivets and it split the first time he used it. His rifle didn't fall out but the integrity of the case was damaged. It was a design flaw rather than poor construction. Don't buy this product."
1,Leaky..no warranty,"I bought one of this companys ""water proof pads"" for my elderly father. It leaked. They sent me a replacement pad (Which also leaked) I failed to get the original pad back to them in 5 days, so they voided the warranty.What a scam! And it was way more expensive than a plastic pad would have been. Lousy product, lousy company."
4,Appreciative,"Wise, well thought out, exposition of author's experience through self growth & facilitating growth in others. Essential to broad understanding of emotional intelligence & freedom."
5,Fascinating,"This is a really solid sequel to ""The Steerswoman"". It progressed the plot (but did not resolve it).The world continued to become more intricate and coherent, as did various relationships in the novel. I liked learning more about the various ""Outskirter"" societies.I look forward to reading the next!"
4,Good Light,Works well and provides adequate light by which to read. The ear piece is a little cumbersome but otherwise its a good buy and well worth the price.
2,"Could someone steady the light, please?","The light itself is bright enough for my uses...crocheting in the car on road trips.But...if I stretched my arm out to pull yarn from the skein, the light would move. If I turned my head to have a conversation or look out the window into the dark night, the light would move. It never stayed in one place for long, even tho I did.The idea of the product is great. But the style and functionality lacks."
1,Too expensive!,"I did a very positive review for this item in the past, but came back to buy another one and the price has jumped again! I have had this exact light for years and it works well. I like that it runs on a AAA battery -- many others run on expensive button batteries. But, I bought mine for $7. Then a few years later bought one for a friend for $11. Now, I'm back to buy one for my brother and mother, but at $18 now way! I will try another similar light for less than half the cost. Bub-bye."
2,Bad Game,"This game could have been great. The concept was good, the graphics were tolerable. But when it comes to gameplay, septerracore fails. The gameplay is repetitive, the bosses are too easy, the 'wilderness' areas are tedious and all the same, involving pulling many switches that toggle 600 doors/bridges all over the map. The graphics are pretty good, but badly executed (i.e. many graphics have been re-used dozens of times). Don't expect a full half-hour of entertainment out of this game."
2,Tedious,"I bought the game because it had very good hype. But I've learned since then that you should never believe in it. This game ranks in my top five of having a great story. The only problem is that the game advances really slowly. The battles take too long, and even if you have a great character you can't avoid the non-random, almost same monster. Tediousness sets in when you have to backtrack several times without advnacing in the story. Monsters always reapear and they are always the same. Graphics are good, in pseudo-3D. Sound is repetitive. And the magic system, needs some work. Bad graphical effects and almost no benefit for using your precious ""mana"" points."
3,Looooooong game gets old after a while,"Septerra Core is a fun game with terrific graphics, a nice plot, and a very good combat system. However, the game is so darn long that it gets REALLY old after a while. As others have complained about, it is really frustrating to have to backtrack and re-fight battles you've seen before. Even when you aren't backtracking, the same opponents appear time and again. The game would be much better if it were a little more like Planescape: Torment -- much less fighting and much more puzzle-type quests. I'm finally pretty close to the end, but I'm thinking of quitting because I can't take the monotony of it any more!"
2,Have you all lost your minds?,"How can you even think of comparing ff8 to this piece of boring garbage?Why do I think this game sucks?1. The peoples faces are the same everyware 2. There are a total of about 15 faces and 16 voices for about 200 people, it reminds me game boy rpg's 3. The loading thing is terrible: you have to wait to enter an area , enter the world map, save, and fight. 4. The characters are stiff. 5. The magic sucks 6. Takes tooo long to do a single task such as in shell 7. 7. The characters are just stiff sprites 8. The only reason i gave this game 2 stars instead of 1 is that the movies are high quality. (But not as good as in ff8)"
3,hello,this is a every usfull book if u want to now what your family chrest says about your family and the ansersters u had
3,A tender loving,"Rafe wanted to own Tanya body and soul. But apparently, marriage wasn't enough for him. Never trusting in her love completely, one ill-fated night almost tore the lovers apart forever. When the truth comes to light, love is once again in the air."
2,Oh Please!,"Is it just me? Am I so jaded that I'm missing something? This just reads like another Guardian columnist's Londonite ""insight"" into fatherdom, is Dadlit a recognised genre yet? Perhaps fascinating to anyone who's never reared kids, but, aside from the glint of recognition for those of us who have, what are we given? I don't want to sound highbrow but this writing is pretty undistinguished, like a succession of Reader's Digest ""funny things that happened on the way to the potty"". I even knew a few of the punchlines he was building to, like a Frank Carson routine. I found it poorly constructed, tame and a must-have for Daily Mail reading accountants who like to wear jeans at the weekend and fantasize about being a bit edgy."
4,A great lesson,John O'Farrell always pleases and gets down to the nitty gritty of life. The characters in this book are totally believable and there is a nice mix of humour and pathos. I couldn't decide who to feel sorry for - the hsuband or the wife!
1,Terrible book - a waste of time,"This book from the outset looks like it going to be a cracker, a bloke who lives 2 lives...... but it disappoints nearly immediately. This is more like watching reality tv, that is listing to some boring idiot describing this life in pitiful detail. The book lacks a creditable storyline, credible/likeable characters. It was only my stubbiness that made me complete the book and I would of burt it in protest if it hadn't been an ebook.A total waste of time - do not go near it unless you are incredibly dull / board / mentally ill."
1,Do me a favour,"Yeah right, Nick Hornby, Bridget Jones, Tony Parsons, thats about the mark. If undistinguished hacks banging on about the obvious is your bag maybe this dismal sack of cliches will be bang up your alley. If you prefer Sade to Hendrix, Freddie Starr to Bill Hicks, Blind Date to Blue Jam then this insipid scribble may well light up your life."
4,Good stuff,"This is a thin novel, and not the deepest thing you'll ever get your hands on. But it's well written, poignant, simply hilarious at moments, and it will keep you reading.Someone has described it as ""Bridget Jones for men,"" and that may well be true, I'm not sure. What I am sure of is this: if you are a kid in a grown-up's body (who isn't?) and if there are times when you wish you could leave all the responsibility behind -- whether that responsibility takes the form of kids, a job you hate, a mortgage payment, or whatever -- you will find something in the main character's ruminations to which you can relate.It's definitely worth a read, and maybe worth two. How many books can you say that about?"
1,HATE IT,I SHOULD HAVE NEVER BOUGHT IT. THE ORIGINAL WAS BETTER. THIS WAS EVEN WORSE THEN THE REMAKE WHICH I DID NOT CARE FOR ALSO.
4,So far so good,"We purchased this for our basement (semi-finished). Its been a few months and its working well. Our basement is very humid - during the summer we have to empty the dehumidifier twice a day in order for it to keep up.It works well, moderately quiet and easy to empty."
1,"Fragile, missing parts and doesn't work automatically","Problems with our unit as received:- the automatic mode (where it should cycle on/off) doesn't work. Doesn't turn on compressor apparently since humidity doesn't go down. The continuous mode does remove humidity, though presumably the compressor keeps running when it doesn't have to.- as received one of the casters was broken- as received the seal to allow changing to hose removal of water was missing. We made one out of pipe seal tape which did the job.I will attempt to return unit, but it is a real hassle to package up something this big (and haul up the stairs). In future I will not mail order items of this size/weight."
3,"Some good, some bad","The unit has been working for several weeks in a basement in a humid climate. It functions well, and is relatively quiet.My one complaint so far is the same as the reviewer who mentioned the poor drain design. I agree with all his points. My drain was clogged within two weeks. However in addition to that there was an internal line made of very thin walled clear plastic which was folded closed. It makes two tight turns and simply collapsed at one of them. It is not hard to replace or repair, but one shouldn't have to do that.This unit replaced a Whirlpool of comparable price and very similar design (with a better drain) which lasted only two years before the refrigerant escaped somehow. Perhaps there's just nothing at this price level of high quality."
2,flimsy,"These are sort of ok, comfortable, easy to use, etc, but they are very light. I just tighened one by hand and it broke at the frame. I am not a super large or strong person, and I wasn't straining. I contacted the seller, we'll see what they will do. Not sure I will be thrilled with a replacement because, well, I should have gotten something stronger."
2,Working with complications,"The starter I purchased is the correct size and fits perfectly with my 1994 Infiniti Q45. The major problem is a noise the starter makes every time my car starts. My car does start and continues running, but when initially starting up the starter creates a long loud grinding noise. There are no other reviews of this starter, so this issue is worrying me.--Written January 14, 2011The starter completely failed me 6 weeks ago, coming home from the grocery store. Because of school and my job I have not been able to consult anyone about this issue. I use my car often, but not for distances over 25 miles. I am not sure if it is the starter or another problem. But having slight hesitation in my car starting, since the new starter, allows me to reasonably assume that it is my starter. I will update once the problem is fully diagnosed.--Written December 11, 2011"
3,The Night the City Screamed~*,"The movie got a tad boring, but it was so worth it to see DC with a moustache! YUM"
1,can't play; can't rate-box is nice,"This rating was choosen as the movie cannot be shown anywhere other than Region 2, where ever that is; don't even know where I would find out"
3,Interesting DVD,"I did like the DVD, it goes well with the book that Dean put out. The only thing is that it does provide a little visual for what is done in the book, but not much. It is more or less a little nudge to see what he discusses in the book.Step by Step to Stand-Up ComedyI do like the book, it is very technical, which helps when you want to know what intuitively already works for you or others.It does the basics of what is listed in the book so if you are reading the book and see the DVD you might feel like you are in the classroom. Actually more like a workshop a longer DVD with a little more in depth would have been better, though it is worth the buy I guess."
5,"""I Can Hear My Heart Beat""","Without being or hireing an Acoustics Engineer I have been able to regulate the sound in my recording studio without having to tear down any walls or what's left of my hair. I am doing it as a private citizen not for hire. So I am sure it is not perfect. However, I no longer have any of those strange ""Thumps,"" ""Crackles,"" ""Snaps,"" or ""Pops"" that wojuld mysteriously compete with the ""echoes,"" ""volume fluctuations,"" and ""missing sounds"" I had before. Yes, I could have made it myself; but this was easier and less time consuming, and took up less space, hauling up-stairs, and then not having room afterward. I mounted it on a light styrofoam backing with long straight, corsage pins. So I can still make changes without having to pull them off the wall. They are very light, resilient, and colorful. Tahnk You Auralex...."
2,Tom Hall - self-titled (Enneagram) 2 1/2 stars,"Some decently(I guess)penned singer-songwriter sort of mellow guitar played with some rather light vocals here.Not really my cup of tea,but I know there are several others out there that would get more out of this self-titled release,apparently sole CD by Tom Hall.Tunes that just might do it for fans of such include the CD opener ""Paris Rains"",""Nothing But Mercy"",""Domestic Life"" and ""This Life I'm Livin'"".See how you like it."
3,Not very quiet,"Maybe there's variation from unit to unit, or maybe I have dog ears, but I wouldn't call this unit quiet. The fan emits a tonal whine (a note that one can sing and harmonize to), and when the compressor kicks in to cool, it makes a typical window AC unit grinding sound. I wish manufacturers would subject their products to standardized sound testing so units could be compared and there would be incentive to reduce noise emissions."
4,Dr.G.Ma,"this was a good air unit, only on real humid days it leaves something to be desired. I am giving it to a family member and getting a larger unit for next year."
1,"No remote, stopped working after 15min....","1. Did not come with an remote.2. One of the corner frame was bent when it came.3. It ran about 15min and stopped, then never turns on.I would like to return the item and receive a new one, and Amazon said there is no way I can replace this because there are no more stock of the item.What a lame..."
2,Noisy - Poor Value!,"This is the window a/c unit that came with my apartment. In terms of cooling, it does the job. BUT, it is very, very noisy. I live in a small apartment and honestly, this thing is so noisy, it was a problem watching TV or having people over with the unit on. I decided to buy a replacement window unit myself this summer so I could have some peace and quiet. I decided on the GE AEM08FM. It has several features I like better - thermostat on the unit and an auto fan setting that manages the air flow to your desired temp. The unit also seems to blow out colder air. AND, it probably makes 1/3 the noise - it just sounds like a breeze. Definitely spend another $120 bucks and skip the Frigidaire!"
3,Works well but was not in good condition upon delivery!,"I received it within a day of ordering with free shipping & the price was right. I did not open the box right away maybe it was 10 days or so later. It was a hot day & my neighbor insisted on installing the air conditioner. When we opened the box it was all smashed in the back where is hangs out the window. I was really disappointed so this means I have to get someone to take it down the stairs & bring it to UPS to return. My neighbor suggested that we run it to see if it worked properly & it was fine. Rather then go through the process of returning the appliance I kept it & it does work beautifully. The part of it that is smashed is out the window so you cannot see it so it does not spoil the looks of it from the inside. So the review is not about the job it does to cool the room, it is about the condition it was received."
4,Works for me,"So far, so good. I received my air conditioner about a month ago, after finding the lowest price at Amazon because of their free shipping! The unit is in my bedroom, and I'm obsessed with the remote and its sleep function, which automatically ups the temperature a few degrees over a few hours. Pure genius for when you crank that baby on at bedtime - wish we had that option with the unit in our living room. Then, I wouldn't have to turn it on and off to find a happy medium in temp. I had the same issues as a couple of users, nicks and dents in the unit and it's a bit noisy, but it's been running smoothly nonetheless."
3,drained into my windowsill!!!,most ACs have drains underneath but in the back of the unit. this one's drain is underneath but off to the side. it lined up perfectly with my windowsill and all the water collected in the windowsill and into my walls (without my knowledge.) the downstairs ceiling fell in.if you don't have this problem it worked great. it even has an energy saver option so it turns off when it gets cool enough.measure the depth of your window first.
4,Very good compact air conditioner,This was a life saver (or maybe sleep saver) during the recent heat waves in the Northeast. It's a little loud but not bad enough to wake us up when it cycles off and on. I would recommend it for anyone needing a compact ac.
1,Noisy and ineffective,"I owned one of these and quickly returned it. It made so much noise I could barely think. Of course you can make the noise stop, if you feel like getting up and smacking the thing every 2 seconds. Don't buy this piece of junk."
5,Great Air Conditioner For The Money,This energy efficient A/C works great and doesn't run up your electric bills much. I put mine in my bedroom as my central A/C doesn't work very well back there. Now I have a very cold bedroom and can sleep better at night. This A/C did have some minor damages in shipping but Amazon knocked off 20% on the unit to compensate me for it. It had some bent fins in the back and the side deal that extends out from the side of the unit was also cracked where it locks into the window seal.I love my A/C unit so far and look forward to lower electric bills and sleeping in comfort everynight now.
4,a good investment,"I bought mine about a year ago. Just recently I took it apart to clean it because it needed cleaning.I had it in the garage over last winter and it had collected leaves and bugs.When I took it out of the window, I did not ask for my wifes help like I should have.It ended up 15ft below, smashed on the ground. I shook it up to see if any broken pieces and then plugged it in. IT WORKED FINE! I took it apart with my wifes help and we cleaned it. While cleaning it I took some pliers and destroyed the annoying peizo buzzer that beeped every time you push a button... Results: A clean AC that blows as cold as when I got it and no annoying beeps.p.s.Thank you Tina"
2,Disappointing,"I decided on a different one later. It has several features I like better - thermostat on the unit and an auto fan setting that manages the air flow to your desired temp. The unit also seems to blow out colder air. AND, it probably makes 1/3 the noise - it just sounds like a breeze. Definitely spend another 25% and skip the this model! This is the window a/c unit that came with my apartment. In terms of cooling, it does the job. BUT, it is very, very noisy. I live in a small apartment and honestly, this thing is so noisy, it was a problem watching TV or having people over with the unit on. I decided to buy a replacement window unit myself this summer so I could have some peace and quiet."
5,Easy to install and use!,"This AC was surprisingly easy to install and fit perfectly in the cut out of my security bars. It took a bit to center the unit and I had to use a power screwdriver for the top bar. All in all, a 20 minute endeavor for one person.From the first few minutes, the AC cooled the room (12'x14') down and kept it nice the whole night. Every desirable option is there - remote, thermostat, auto shut-off - and they work perfectly. I especially liked the thermostat option for nights, so it would keep the room cool without staying on all night.It's pretty quiet and I had no issues whatsoever with noise with the unit very close to my bed.When removing the AC, I didn't drain it properly (you need to leave it at least half a day) so the floor got soaked, but it wasn't bad at all.Highly Recommended!"
2,It gets super cold but at a price!,"Yes i have to admit that this AC unit does what it is suppose to do! It makes my apartment cold after just a few minutes but please be aware... THIS AC IS LOUD LOUD LOUD! Even on the lowest setting i can't hear the tv or keep a normal conversation without having to half scream. Trying to sleep is impossible since it is like you have an industrial machine humming like crazy!Also the remote control is clunky and looks cheap, does not have a digital indicator on it..ugh!"
3,Good but not great.,"I Bought this for my living room, and it is better than not having any A/C however it is not as good as the air conditioners I've had in my past. It doesn't get that cold at all, this is definitely for a VERY small room. I would say like a 10 by 10 room, probably the smallest room in your house, next to the bathroom. Don't buy this is you have 90 degree weather and up, you'll be disappointed."
4,Good buy for it's price and size.,"The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because is a little noisy but that was expected. I have a studio with low ceilings that is 26 x 10 is divided in two rooms for a french door.if I keep the door close. the big room stay really cool on the high mode. which is good because is where my computer is. if I open the doors which is during the nigh keep the two rooms cool but not as much as if I have the doors close. Helps I have fan ceilings for example if the bedroom and computer room is at 86f after a little while the temperature in the bedroom will be 80 and in the computer room 76. So it works. eventually cools a little more. I just got it a couple weeks a ago so I haven't check my electricity bill yet. Does the job, good buy."
2,Too noisy! We can't hear ourselves think!,"Any cooling benefits obtained from this air conditioner are extinguished by its NOISINESS. We installed it in our kitchen window and can't keep it on when we sit at the table that's how noisy it is! I am SO disappointed in Frigidaire, which up to now, I'd thought was a great brand."
2,Poor performance,"I've owned this unit for a little over a year. The air that comes out is relatively cool, but nearly as much as some cheapy i bought at costo around 7 years ago that still pumps out very chilly air. Since I bought it, it's performance has gotten even worse. Not a very good AC."
1,Not nearly good,"This AC makes splashing noise and it's pretty annoying. I read about that technology that water being lifted by the fan inside the AC to cool off the radiator. This technology is ridiculous and you find it out only after you open the box and install the ac. Any small mistake in installation even make the noise even worse. Guess what, windows are not leveled.I own 3 year Zenith AC which I got from home depot and it works like a charm. I guess next year I'm going back to home depot to spend less and get something better than Frigidaire."
2,3 Years,"I bought this AC unit on June 6, 2008. On July 24, 2011, it started making squealing sounds whenever it ran. We were afraid to use it.Figuring that we'd have to buy a new unit anyway, I decided to open it, in the slight chance that I could repair it. These things don't just pop open. An hour later, I found that a little rubber seal on the axle that drives the fans had rotted and fallen into the centrifugal fan compartment.I don't know if that qualifies as planned obsolescence, but it amounts to the same thing. Most people would have bought a new unit. I almost did.I put it back together (minus the seal) and it appears to work fine.I should mention that, when working on devices like this, always make sure they're unplugged. And watch out for capacitors that can shock you even if the unit's unplugged."
2,Not very good,"I bought this to cool a 12x12 room that has no central air or heat. I had been using an old small window unit that cooled the room just fine but it died. After reading the reviews I decided on the Frigidaire FAA055P7A.Bad Choice. Very disappointed in the quality and performance.1. During install, the pull-out accordian style louvers tore in several places. I didn't use excessive force or mishandle them in any way. The plastic is too rigid and thin and when you expand them they start to crack at the seams. There is also a gap between the plastic and the track the louvers sit in.2. Has a hard time keeping the room at a comfortable temperature when the outside temp is over 80 degrees.3. When running there is a loud sound of splashing water. I tried mounting the unit at different angles to ensure proper drainage but the problem persists.Thumbs down on this unit."
2,Frigidaire 8000 BTU Air Conditioner,"It beeps every time I turn it on, off, or make an adjustment on the remote or on the A/C control panel.The unit cools fine."
2,The bottom bar was bent out of shape.,"The bar was really bent out of shape, so my porter [a strong guy] had to try to bend it back. The bar is what makes the accordion go back and forth to fit the window's width. It is really heavy metal so it must have been smashed in ORIGINALLY at its origin.I don't know how efficient it is because it's cool in New York now.I was impressed with the overall look and the energy rating.Some of the corresponding HOLES were missing. And even the batteries were smashed FLAT for the remote.It was the first thing that ever arrived all banged up.The remote is NOT easy to figure out.I rarely return anything, so we had to correct it ourselves. Luckily, I bought really good tools."
5,Great A/C,This is a great little a/c unit. Cools down my 11x12 room quickly. Quiet unit. Convenient remote control is a bonus.
1,Leaks buckets . . .,I've had this model for a year. The first summer it didn't leak at all. This summer . . it drenches the sill and floor - I mean it would easily fill two large buckets full of water. It never really cooled all that great either and it's used in a small room. I don't mind the noise - I just wanted it to work better than this. Frigidaire used to be a quality name - but that's the way it goes these days . . won't buy anything with their name on it again.
3,beware,placed order on may 23 unit stopped working end of june call frigidaire customer service nearest app. july 11 all day app. service tech. deemed unit defective july 30 still no call from frigidaire summer just over no a/c
4,An ode to 4AD,"Astral reminds me of my favorite bands from the 4AD label of the late 80's early 90's. Cocteau Twins, Lush and Curve to name a few. Very atmospheric and beautiful."
4,Early Review,"So far I've only played Wasteland. It's exactly as I remembered it. The DOS installation program failed, but it wasn't needed since the copy on the disk was the fully installed program, not the original setup files. The downside is that you can't choose options or restart the game with the same characters. However, you can restart the game if you put a fresh copy on a rewritable disk, load the game from another disk, then save it on the disk with all monsters / treasure in place."
5,Game for all seasons,"It was a dark and stormy night when four of us of different ages, backgrounds and personalities sat down to play Pop Smarts. The little one (age 10) loved it because he was in charge. The oldest one (age 60) loved it because he was enjoying the family moment. The baby boomer(49) had a blast because the questions evoked misty nostalgia for her youth and the Generation x-er (36) started wondering how he could invent and market something that would be this much fun.We played for three hours, without a break, and laughed and argued and discussed and generally had a great time, which is what games are all about.In these times of uncertainty, with the constant stream of horrible news on television, cyberspace and radio, this game was an island of innocence and fun. It's hip and well worth the money."
3,Mi-marketed,The product was marketed as a Delta product. It is not but rather a secondary market replacement without any brand.
2,120 grit on the Delta makes for a rough finish,Don't expect to get the same results with 120 on the Delta that you would with a ROS. It removes a reasonable amount of stock but it doesn't compare to the speed or quality of finish that a planer would provide.I would expect about the only use for 120 grit would be the removal of a significant amount of material on a wide panel. Something that would not fit in a planer. Otherwise go with the planer then finish off with 220 on the Delta.
1,"Totally worthless, do not buy this","This is the worst travel video and possibly the worst video I have ever seen. Where to begin...the narration has nothing to do with the visuals. While the narrator is talking about volcanic lakes the visuals are of pigs in the mud, and the volcanoes are never shown. This happens continuously. There is no helpful information whatsoever contained in this video. The photography is bad and the editing is worse. Utterly worthless, shameful."
4,Fast-reading suspense,A chilling and very fast-moving novel of psychological suspense. I recommend it!
1,"Horrible, I shouldn't even give it one star!","This book was horrible, and I only started reading it yesterday! I shouldn't even give it one star. When I started reading it, I put it down, she is not a very good writer, and I am not going to finish it because everything in it is all messed up! I couldn't even follow it. If you like to read romance/mysteries you should read Bloodline by Jill Jones. It's so much better."
4,(Mostly) Spectacular Spider-Man Factbase,"An informative read, this book contains a highly ambitious study of past characters/cross-overs in the Spider-Man realm from 1963 to 2002. The textual chapters, however, are written in a rather trite form, filled with annoying, smarmy pop-culture references seemingly aimed (and misfiring) at younger audiences. And yet, these chapters are mercifully brief, and not the real grabber for the book."
2,Not Worth My Time,"I found it very stilted in style and obviously written with a bias, at least in the beginning-I did not read it all. I expected a much more expansive view of the different forms on Atheism."
3,It's Pike . . . yet it's not.,"I've always been a huge Pike fan. My absolute favorite book from *any* author is ""The Season of Passage."" It's on the top of my list. So I've been waiting a long time for something new.The books starts out promising but soon begins to read just like Pike's YA novels. The characters are described as being adult, but their dialogue and actions are very juvenile.I was disappointed by the ending. It was like a B movie; the ""bad guy"" spelled everything out for the lead character instead of the lead character discovering things for himself. During the book he was ""stumbling"" on clues entirely by chance, it seemed, and it was all laid out a bit too neatly.If you're a Pike fan I recommend this book because even if I didn't, a true Pike fan would read it anyway. But if you're just starting to get into Pike's books, make sure you read ""The Season of Passage"" before you go any farther!"
2,Doesn't feel like Pike,"Sadly,THE BLIND MIRROR is a terrible book...it's wordy,it'stedious,and the characters all kind of run together and blur.When Pike gets going,he can really write,as evidenced by MONSTERand WHISPER OF DEATH and THE SEASON OF PASSAGE. Pike rarelydisappoints me,but THE BLIND MIRROR barely feels like a Pike story."
1,WHERE IS PIKE?,"How can BLIND MIRROR be out of print? As far as Pike's fans know, this book has never been published. I never saw it at the bookstore, or at the library. And the last I heard, Mr. Pike was still working on it. Anyway, where is Christopher Pike? He hasn't had a book out in over a year. (I see all these publishing dates for his SPOOKSVILLE series as 1999, I haven't seen those since 1997.) Everytime I go to the store, I look for a new book, but it's not there. So no review can be given."
3,Issues much?,"I have been reading Pike since I was a teenager and have always been fascinated by his style and creativity; however, it seems almost all of his novels involve a soul-sucking, life-draining woman at the center, and The Blind Mirror is no different. Overall, I enjoyed the novel, but it seems as if Mr. Pike has serious issues about women."
2,The Blind Mirror,"I just finished reading this novel, though it was engaging, i thought that it lacked a good resolution or else purpose. I'm an avid Christopher Pike fan, i've read many of his works, and i loved every single one so far. Having said that, i had high hopes for the Blind Mirror. Unfotunately it was weak and i feel like i found the only bad Christopher Pike novel, and that in itself is pretty upsetting. The only reason i finished it was because i kept thinking that the ending would be brilliant and deep, as his novels usually are, and would make the entire novel worthwhile. It wasn't. Therefore i am not going to recommend The Blind Mirror to any of you, instead i suggest you read The Last Vampire series, Sati and The Season of Passage which are some of my favourites and showcase the author's talent to the fullest."
5,Awesome!,"I use these at work and have them up in my cubicle. I get compliments all the time! They work great for my pictures and obvioulsy, don't take up a lot of room. Would recommend and order again! Thanks!"
2,Graphic SF Reader,"This is quite a hodge-podge, in general, didn't care for the artwork. Lot of jokes here, too, mostly being Spider-Man. A completely 100% manga styled slim-hipped pillow smooth nancy boy Wolverine was just too creepy, I think. A nice little Man-Thing Cameo, in the most realistic looking artwork, with the Lizard."
5,Great book on leadership!,"This incredibly detailed book, and sometimes, lengthy is a great study on the concepts of leadership and management. One of the best I've read. If you're interested in leadership, this should be a book you take a look at.I also highly recommend The Management Masters Series Corporate Culture if you liked this one."
2,Too long,"It has useful information but what could be explained in a lot fewer pages but has been stretched to almost 400pgs. Read other books such from Maxwell, Anthony Robbins, and Robert Green."
3,"It's OK, not fantastic","I got this game a few years back. I also have the original late 80s version that Milton Bradley put out. The puzzles on the cards are similar to the rebus puzzles used on the game show ""Concentration"" where symbols represented words. If you're good at these, you'll probably like this game. It got mixed reviews in my game group the two years or so I brought it. I bought it back again recently with just the point scoring involved. Some liked it, others didn't. A couple of players just couldn't figure out a lot of the puzzles.If you're looking for a word or picture puzzle game, you may want to consider this to add to your collection, but there are better games out there."
1,ummmm...david is pretty off here...,"This book reads like a very bad harry potter fantasy via my state...as if Mamet portrayed in words some bad postcard with all the stereotypes folks have...while I like a few of his early plays, this is just crap....it's a wonder Mamet has lived here for so long and gleamed so little as to the nature of this place...at one point he says that not only does he live in an 18th century farmhouse with an original stone cellar and pontificate upon it and the history sealed into it's very foundation, he then tells us that he does not know anyone here amongst his circle who does not live in a such a similar house...David, go out and deal with some real Vermont folks would you? Might do you some good...have fun with that expensive desk and rare wood stove...keep going back and forth as well as to how you feel about it.I give folks who have visited here a few days this book and tell them to have a good laugh...and not listen to a damn word of it."
5,Kitaro,"I have been listening to KITARO for years it is the most soothing music when I need to unwind. When a friend passed he left his music to me. It was the best gift. Someone had stolen the original music and I finally came across it again, I gave this same gift to my sister and now she loves it too."
3,"cute, simple","Cute, simple little board book. Small enough to carry in the diaper bag, it's good to buy a few minutes in line or the waiting room. My baby and my toddler both enjoy seeing the duck finger puppet wiggle around, even if the story is a bit dull."
4,few pages,"few pages, thick pages, cute poem. Duck could be a little longer, fairly short for my finger and hard for my little one to grab onto."
2,"Lame text, lame illustrations.","I know you don't buy a finger puppet book if you're looking for a gripping page-turner, but this book's text is lame and boring. Nothing happens! Little duck is shy, likes the water and the sky, etc., and he likes to play peekaboo. The end. The illustrations are equally lame, basically depicting the duck in a pond or....next to the pond. My son looooves books of all kinds, but this one, not so much. We just use this as a finger puppet and skip the book part all-together. You would do better by buying a bunch of inexpensive finger puppets (ikea sells a bunch for cheap) and creating your own stories and songs."
1,terrible,i can't believe people gave this a good review.this is the worst hdmi switch box you will ever come across.half the time the remote doesn't work and this is with a brand new battery.the other things that are wrong with it is the picture.lots of times you get fuzzy lines so you have to keep changing the switch on the box and go to video 2 and then video 3 and then back to video 1 to get the picture to show up with no lines and with sound again.and that doesnt always work.sometimes you have to turn it off and back on again and that doesn't always fix the problem.so this thing is just one headache after another.i am back on amazon to order a different box and hopefully i will find a better one.anything will be better than this one.
5,Great product,"Fantastic product I puchased this product 1 month ago. It works great!!! I have a panny 1080p television with a nice picture, this product upgraded the signal to 1440. really. I recommmend this product to anyone and save yourself a couple hundred dollars."
4,Level of Satisfaction,"Very nice Telescope, very good price, fast delivery.It would be ussefull if the provider include a list and prices of accessories for this Telescope."
5,An Oi must.,"Musically it doesn't get much better than this if you love punk with strong roots in late 50's early 60's era rock. Racist lyrics? Depends on where you draw the line (when is pride prejudice?), but they are definitely controversial. However you look at it though you will have to agree, these are some catchy tunes."
1,racist pussie's,"Not only is the message weak and neandratholic, the singer sounds like he's had tons of kilbasa slammed down his throat! Rest In Piss Ian."
5,"Clear, concise and beautiful!","This book was one of the first books that lead me on my spiritual journey in Catholicism. Karl Keating explains with clear logic and and excellent use of scripture the fundamental beliefs of the Catholic faith. The book is very well documented and easy to read. I would not only recommend it to those who are outside the Church, but also those who wish to learn more about their faith."
5,Must Read For Dune Fans,"Eye is a collection of short stories that showcase the genius of Frank Herbert. Many of the main themes of his popular Dune series are seen in each of the stories. One of these is a small section entitled ""The Road to Dune"" containing illustrations of some scenes from the Dune universe, namely the palace of Arakeen. Even though I'm an intense Dune fan I found the story of the Bacit and the Tegas to be my favorite. Eye is a smattering of worlds and ideas all from the same mind that created Dune. It does not disappoint."
3,"Really small and easy to pack, but not very absorbant","It felt like this towel did more pushing around of water than actually absorbing it. It felt like I was wrapping a piece of suede around me. Given the option, however, I don't know if I had room in my backpack (I used it backpacking for a month) for a real towel. It's a toss-up on this one."
5,Excellent resource for classic illusions,"It is rare when you come across a book on optical illusions that has something new to offer, but this is what sets The Playful Eye apart from many of the other optical illusion books currently on the market.The Playful Eye is a wonderful collection of classic illusions that were printed on obscure puzzle cards, postcards, trading cards, advertisements, and the like during the late 19th to mid 20th century. The editors have done a remarkable job in collecting these illusions from obscure source material and private collections. What is even more remarkable, and in my mind, one of the best aspects of this charming collection, is the amount of research that they put in labeling the sources for each image. This is a real reference tool for an illusion collector like myself.The illustrations are wonderful and you are bound to see images that are not seen elsewhere. Lots and lots of fun!"
1,it[s bad],"This is a good game, but having to enter a sixteen character password is unforgiveable. The game costed.., it should have a battery backup. I was assuming it would."
3,"Great start, but gets tiring after a while","Visually a great looking game. But the gameplay gets tiresome. Unrealistic racing conditions affect only you as your opponents zoom by. With the absense of any other type of game play, the game snores into the finish line. Get tony hawk instead. Unless you are a true race fan."
1,Don't even bother,"This game isn't even worth your time, sure it looks decent but it actually is a pain and tedious to play. It has a simple setup of: the car is centered in the screen, the track simply curves left and right. Sure you can upgrade your cars and build your own tracks, but even that is severely limited and restricted, (for example, you can only add turns on a small graph, and can't even change the background or music, etc.) Avoid this game at all costs!"
2,Not what I thought it would be.,This games is only okay. The time trial and choosing a car were fun but the graphics are terrible. Stay away from the game. It is a waste of money.
4,good game,"The game is good. The graphics are excellent for a handheld device, and the play is realistic. However, there is no save function, and to get to your level, you must enter a password. This would not be that bad, except for the fact that the password is 16 characters long."
4,awesome game,GT Advance Championship Racing is one of the best racing games I have played. It requires skill but not enough to make it impossible to win. Unlike MarioKart you have to brake on turns and pick a certain car for what type of track you are racing on. Probably the best part of the game is winning new cars and parts and then tuning your car up. The graphics are awesome and the only bad part of the game is the stupid 16 character password you need to save with. If you get this game make sure to take your time writing down the passwords or else lose all of your progress.
4,Great Graphics and Fun Gameplay With Only Minor Flaws,"It is a great game that is fun to play but it only has 1 minor flaw in my opinion. (And then it has a minor, minor flaw.) The minor flaw is the password thing as opposed to saving your game. The minor minor one is the annoying music. Other than that it is really good."
2,Why GT Advance is not that good,The game is okay until you get to the point when youre ready to save and you find out that there is a stupid code-password save system. It ruins the value of the game. Just get GT3 for PS2 instead.
2,Cheapy advance racing,"This game is kinda cheap of course the graphics are great, but u need a good light source. The password thing gets really anoing but you can get good passwords from your friends to get good courses. I am a freak about kart racing games,so i do like this one cheat that lets you have go karts instead of cars. This is an ok game. If you love kart racing games,or like them just as much as regular racing games, I recomend you getting Konami Krazy Racers or Mario Kart Super Circuit."
1,Rubbish,This game is rubbish the graphics are tiny and blotchy the music is very rubbish and it freezes whilst playing it. mario carts advance is a lot better than this . don;t waste your money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Horrible,"This may be a biased review since I'm not a big fan of racing games, but I think it [is bad]. I only bought it because it was the only decent looking game.., but that's all it is. Just nice graphics, but other than that, I can't stand it. It's comparable to those little 15 dollar racing games for 5 year olds with the picture of a car in the center, and you have a little steering wheel and the track just circles around your car. The handling is really bad, and you can spin out way too easily. Save yourself some money and frustration and don't buy it."
2,save your cash,This game [edit]. It is impossible to control. The cars look like mini-vans. Pretty background though.
3,"Cool game, but annoying password system.","First off, I want to say that I enjoyed the game. The music was okay, and the graphics were really nice. I liked the fact that there were so many cars to choose from and that different parts and cars are unlocked as you progress through the game.Having said that... the password system kills it all. It takes me two or three minutes just to put it in. Seriously. If you have an hour to play, it doesn't really matter. But if you don't have much video-game-stamina, you will get tired of this game very quickly. I played this game, and liked it, for about two weeks. But that was due to the fact that I was on a family vacation and couldn't do anything with the family because of an injury. I was bored. Very bored. Once I got home, I tried playing the game two or three more times, but since then I have never picked it back up.My advice: get GT Advance Championship Racing 2. I hear that it is just as good as the original, BUT SAVES YOUR PROGRESS."
3,Great game until you decide to try to continue,"Fun game great graphics, but.. the password save is horrible. It takes way too long to put in the password. If it had a real save feature instead of the password then it would be great. Since it doesn't it ruins the game. This won't help their ... reputation any bit."
1,SCAM!!,picture was an exhaust tip. what I got was a water pump gasket for a car I don't own. Don't waste your time.
1,wrong picture,I was looking at exhoust tips which this items pic is of. I sent an email after I ordered it and realised the description disnt match the photo but it still has same photo over a month later. Its not just their falt I should have read beter but it is their fault if anyone else gets screwed because I told them
1,Not applicable for product description,the picture and description of this product does not correspond to the product I received. Actual item is a rubber stamp for pontiac thermostat identified with the number 35126. http://www.amazon.com/Fel-Pro-35126-Gaskets-Thermostat-Seal/dp/B000C2CA7C/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1347633131&sr=8-2&keywords=35126+felpro
2,heavy book to hold down recylcing container,"Given this book as a gift, and unfortunately it is of little use to me. I already know how to cook real whole foods, exercise, and do not need inspiration for baby steps into healthy living. These books are all the same, written for people looking for someone else to tell them what to eat and live forever, without much mental or physical effort, while only ever going halfway so as not to alienate potential buyers/readers. Recycling bin here we come."
5,The Low-Carb Bible,"Thanks for this comprehensive carbohydrate diet book. The most impressive part of the book is the recipes, which are excellent. I have tried most of them and get rave reviews from my nieces and nephews."
5,Mejor descubrimiento desde que Colon descubrio las Americas!,"Han de creer que exagero, pero no es asi... QUE BUENA BACHATA! Y que honor el mio ser la primera en comentar acerca de este CD ""Dosis de Amor"". Fui a visitar por primera vez a R.D. para celebrar mis bodas de plata y tocaron BASTANTE este CD en nuestro hotel, especialmente las canciones ""Por el Alcohol"" y ""Princesa"". No es de sorprenderse que reclame para mi esa ultima cancion (Princesa) porque es TAN romantica y la emocion en la voz de Frank al cantarla es indescriptible. Gracias, Frank, por ese lindo regalo de aniversario! Sin embargo, mi cancion favorita del CD es ""Compadre"". Hasta los muertos se levantan para bailar esa! Y me quede impresionada al oir el regaeton ""Llevate la Cama Pa' la Calle"". No me imaginaba que Frank Reyes podia ser tan diverso en su estilo musical. Keep those songs coming, Frank! LOVE THEM!"
1,Poor game,"The game never would load. I have double checked the spec. and I meet or excede all the Spec. The game says media not found and I have downloaded all new drivers for every thing just to see if that was the problem, still no luck. Wedd site no help eather. Becareful if you buy this game!!!!"
3,its okay,"okay first of all here is what i think of it=Pros=awsome online gamealot of vehicles to drivea good online experianceCons=Horrible single player AIalot of bugscan run very slow on computerscan get extremly boreing on single playerOkay i no i was a little harsh but if your not into singleplayer,by all means buy this game.if your not into multiplayer DO NOT buy this game!!!"
5,Amazing,"Amazing, absolutely amazing. I haven't even had a chance to play it online yet, and I still think it's amazing. From some of the reviews I had read about BF: Vietnam, I wasn't sure how the single player version was going to be, but I have to tell you, it's wonderful. I played through the Allied campaign in a little over a day, and I'm still fighting my way through the Axis campaign. (I haven't even made it to the expansions yet. Wow I'm entertained...)"
1,BAD Serial numbers on installation No Customer Help@EA,I purchased this pkg from amazon and it was new. Not used.When trying to install on my xp machine it refuses to accept any of the codes on the booklet for the different modules. So far only fun I've had is mixing aspirin with tums. EA is unreachable by phone and doubt they will ever answer my tech support request. They won't see another nickel from me.
5,Could not put it down,"I had the pleasure of meeting the author of this book & I was telling him I will probably have this read in one night. I was absolutely right. The first page of this book captured me and I was unable to put it down. Each chapter I kept on reading wondering what was going to happen next. I love the fact that he focused on the bond between the sisters, teenage pregnancy and homosexuality. Instead of sugar coating everything and making it sound like some sort of fairy tale, Mr. Allen gave us a nice bittersweet novel. And THAT is what made this such an excellent read!"
3,Not too bad,"Not too bad for those with about 1 year FMPro experience. This book is not a natural follow-on to the basic FMPro quickstart book, and the examples seem to be wrong in several places.However, I did pick up several useful bits of info, and would recommend it as a rainy day read."
2,Worth a couple of bucks -- no more,"I got one of these recently, and I want to say this: it's worth a couple of bucks. But that's all.It's a thin sheet of hot-stamped steel coated with shiny Nickel that was cut out in a ""tray with handles"" shape. If you imagine cutting out a sheet of paper in a ""tray with handles"" shape, and embossing a (nice enough) design around the edge, then you've got the basic idea. It looks deceptively pretty in the photos, but it will never be mistaken for very nice serveware in person.It is sturdier than disposable plastic trays or paper plates. It is not, however, really sturdy -- just better than disposable dishes.If the price is low enough, however, you may find that this fills the bill for informal functions. There's no reason why you couldn't use this (or lose this) at a church potluck, or middle school dance, or company picnic."
4,Hellsing is awesome!!!,"I read all the Hellsing manga first before I started watching. I was hooked with the very first episode. I'm into dark story lines, supernatural creature features, with some violence on the side. It is amazing. Short. :'( But, was well worth the paid for money for it. It's about a vampire called Alucard who fights with the humans to keep the world in balance from pretty much Hell on earth."
2,Very uneven,"I wanted to like this series but I found it very schizophrenic. It tries to be very dark with gallons of blood spilled by even the slightest wound, but then abruptly charges gears (and art styles) into juvenile cutesy-poo humor. Add to the fact you only get four episodes in a huge box set makes this a very poor value."
5,bangin movie,A must have if u love anime I have 1-8 can't wait for to to release 9-10 I will buy that also
5,Hellsing,I LOVe it it goes great wITH Ultimate voulumes 5-8. i love anime and just started collecting anime and i decided to start off with HELLSING to be my First series to buy.
3,OK,"The book is OK, but there is way too much detailed explanations about the liver, etc.this might be useful to some people, but I just wanted a ""list"" of foods to eat and foods to avoid. Also, the original publishing date is 1996, which makes me wonder if the information in the book is relevant today."
4,Life changes fr Health,"This book is helpful to anyone preparing to make the life-style diet changes to support a healthy liver. It is informative and succinctly written. Wrestling with High Cholesterol and unable to tolerate statins, related Liver challenges has accumulated to a point of needed change and this book has benefited me becoming informed about the process."
4,The Liver-Cleansing Diet,I really like this book. I could not locate my original copy so I ordered another one. That's how much I like it. The recipes are good and you do not have to follow exactly and it still works.
3,Old hat advice,"The good thing about this book is that it eventually groups all of that over the counter liver help advice in one place. However it does take eight chapters to get to it. On the bright side the book is an easy read and if you can stand the four to five chapters of her trying to sell the reader on the diet -yes Dr I get it a clean liver is a happy liver, JUST GET ON WITH IT- then you can sit with a note pad at the local book store and take notes. It is that easy."
3,Liver cleanse diet,"I found this a very good source for learning how to do the cleansing diet. Only thing missing was a shopping list, although she did provide recipes to follow, I preferred to come up with my own. I did use some of the recipes for ideas. I wish she had given some recipes for the juices. Other than that, a very informative reference on how to and why to do a liver cleanse."
5,THE Best Diet Probably Ever Put Together,"I first discovered this book in the fall of 2001. I have repeatedly gone back to this diet about every 6 months after straying and each time feel fantastic. Dr Cabot's supplements are sensational but unlike so many other self-help health books, her programme isn't dependent on the reader's shelling out big bucks for designer-line products. I have found adding frozen wheatgrass juice and good probiotics to the programme to be very beneficial, as does eliminating gluten.My cholesterol, blood pressure, weight and liver enzymes are the best in my extended family and after many years of diets I must say this is probably the VERY best one under the sun.My sole critisism with the book is that not all of the recipes were particularly great--but the principles are easily cross-applied and a very small price to pay for a minor health epiphany.Dr Cabot also answers personal health questions--check out her website for more information."
2,Not quite what I had hoped,"This was not what I was really looking for, as the title of this review may have suggested. I did learn a few things, and the diet itself looks interesting, though I have not tried it. But to me, the book was more self-promoting than educational. I was hoping for more facts, supported by statistics, and studies, rather it was if the author was trying to show her colleagues that her ideas were valid. They may be, I am not in any position to argue, but I was hoping for more information on the liver itself, and the possible disorders. I found only one paragraph with my condition discussed.Still, I am not sorry that I read it, and like I said earlier, I did learn some things, I am just sorry I didn't find it in the library. I hope this helps in your decision making."
2,Campy Ice Skating Tape,"What a waste of money. These girls can hardly stand up on skates and the nude photo shoots are often done with them lying on a blanket on the ice. The VHS tape was in fine condition and arrived promptly so the seller was good, but what was I expecting...Tanya Harding doing a skating routine totally nude....maybe next year!!"
2,A big disappointment,"Kotov's other 2 books in this series are very good,but this one is terrible.There is too much propaganda and little instructive value.It is not even interesting.My advice to you is--buy `Think Like a Grandmaster'and `Play Like a Grandmaster',but don't touch this one !"
2,Not for casual readers.,if you like fiction and you want to try a non-fiction then this is not the right book to start with. Besides the chapters a more about the place as it is aptly named. It is more like a geography textbook.
3,It's all theory!!!!,"If you're looking for a book to jumpstart into the world of Direct X and 3D, this is not it!!! There's not a single piece of example code to be found anywhere... However, it does tells a lot about history and concepts about 3D graphics. Might be handy to have in your library. Still it's too expensive for what it is(luckily, I got it cheap... :) It's not something I would recommend if you want to start your 3D coding but if you know next to nothing about 3D graphics, it's good for theory and concept reference."
2,don't buy it,"Well the book is ok but you can get better infosome where else (black art of 3d programming, etc). It give basic intro nothing big, and allit does is complane about how the 3d industry is.I thought this book was on direct3d programming,but i thought wrong. No programming samples in thebook, but basic intro into the RM and IM api.If you need a reference on functions just buydirect3d pro reference. If you are new to direct3dprogramming the directx documents gives you thesame or probably more info than this book."
5,Micro Can Only Be Learned Through This Book,"You can go to class, or you can read a big fat ugly book, and still you won't learn about micro bugs until you buy this book. AN EXCELLENT REVIEW on almost all of the important bacteria, fungi, virus and parasites. The toons are very funny (and you keep them in your head all your life ). And for learning the basics on antibiotics it is wonderful. This book has helped me in the most desperate conditions (impossible exams), and believe me, YOU GOTTA HAVE IT !"
5,What a cool book!,"This microbiology book is very easy to read, and tables at the end of the each chapter are really helpful to me.Many illustrations are hard to forget... Though I don't think it is adequate for immunology parts, it gave me a brief overview of microbiology and valuable mnemonics."
2,"BROKEN POLES!! and some leaking, good size and easy to put up","Ok - so the tent was super easy to put up and more than enough room for 2. Hard to figure out 3 people, unless it's a small child or canine companion! However, within the first day, the small pole broke. After a raining weekend with a little bit of leakage, but mostly dry, we put the tent up to dry out at home. Within one day, 3 of the main poles broke at the seams. And of course, the ""10 year warranty"" didn't cover the poles. We're considering replacement poles, but it might be worth it to just invest in a different tent. Sort of disapointing as my husband got it as a 5 year at work gift. Guess we should've read these reviews before choosing that as our gift!"
1,not as big as advertised,"My husband is 6'3"" and there's no way he fits in this tent. We like the design and the set up was easy. We bought an air mattress size 6'6"" by 5' to go inside and it wouldn't fit in this supposedly 8' by 8' tent. I'm very disappointed in the tent size."
1,LEAKS RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX,Took this tent right out of the box brand new at the campsite. Set-up was easy and quick which was a good thing because it was raining. After set-up it didn't take long for the seams to start leaking...continuous drips in the ceiling seems of the rain guard on top. The second night we used aluminum foil and cardboard placed on top of the tent to keep the roof from leaking. I guess I'll buy some seam sealer to try to solve this problem but should a person really have to expect a brand new tent to leak right out of the box? WHEN BUYING MY NEXT TENT I WILL SPEND A LITTLE MORE MONEY TO GET QUALITY. NO MORE WENZELS.
1,not good as i expected,"This is the second tent I bought to replace my old one, I was disappointed the size was much smaller than it described fits for 3 people, it might measure 8 by 8 foot from pentadome corner to corner, but that corner space is total wasted. Top roof cover is also not well designed that blocks wings. My old tent was mush bigger the usable space and top roof cover doesn't block wings through, and roof also much higher than this new one."
5,Mark Schultz,Loved this DVD. Mark Schultz has such a great personality and it comes out in this CD/DVD.
1,God save us from horrible experiments like this...,"I was itching to purchase this game when it was advertised, cause frankly, on paper it sounds GOOD. The reality however falls waaayyy short of the mark. First off, this game DEFINES linear gameplay! There is NO where to go but exactally where you need to. Second, there are NO random combat scenes, which to me is essential for an RPG. Third, combat is awkward and horriblly frustrating, not to mention NO fun.Talk about false advertising at it's finest."
4,I liked it,"A terse review I suppose, but I liked it. Not the best of all games, but I had fun playing. And as was suggested before, being out-numbered and short on ammo does indeed increase the fun level. I guess some people don't like having to work a little for the win but this game makes if enjoyable. It is an old game, know that but as we have all found over the years, the age of a game really does not matter does it. The game either works for you or it don't. Once again, I liked it.Hail Flavius!"
1,Not that much fun,"I'd say the Gamespot review is right on target. Neat graphics, totally linear storyline, weird combat system, not enough ammunition.I suppose the lack of ammunitions does a good job of simulating the tension that you might feel entering the secret city, not knowing what's around the next corner, but it's mostly annoying.I played for a few hours, made it past the first boss, then just got fed up and bored.Save your money."
2,Cool story line,"It has a good story line and cool game play but it lacks something I don't know, maybe a naked chick for the gamers."
3,A Matter of Spunk,"Throughout this book, Marjorie and her mother and sister try to find their true home. They leave their old home to Dad and move to California. Upon reaching their arrival, they rent an apartment in an exquisite building. They survive wacky neighbors and friends and the end of the world with wit and charm and a sense of discovery. After they are moved within the residence, they begin to each have personal problems- school, money, friends, and more- and pull away from eachother, and they decide to be independent as a family and move on to find their true home once again. A Matter of Spunk is all about looking to yourself and others you love for hope and support you in this crazy cycle we call life."
5,Love It!,"This book is a sequel to The Cattle Baron's Bride, which was about petite Lucy wishing she was as strong as Margaret, while this book, as the previous reviewer said, is about Margaret wishing she was as dainty as Lucy. I sympathize with the tall woman, since I am tall, but I know self esteem problems result from not being content with what God made you, whether that is tall or short. Both of these stories are great about bringing out how much God loves His children, no matter what, and also portraying the changes unconditional human love can make in a life."
1,"Terrible book, difficult read","I have taken 3 years of thermodynamics with different books. This book being the worst! I felt I 'delearned' after trying to read some of the chapters. The early chapters were good in explaining the basis of thermodynamics. The rest of the book is way too general, the equations are derived for extremely general cases and it makes trying to relate to real world situations near impossible. The problems at the end of the chapters are not easy and there are NO good examples within the chapters. The problems are written poorly and often open to interpretation so students can get 5 or 6 different answers to one problem. If you are forced to use this book I would recommend that you do NOT read the chapters, only work the problems. Buy a different book to study thermodynamics from."
1,HORRIBLE,"I wish there was an option to give this negative stars. Or at least zero.If you think this book is good, then it is because of one of two things. Either: 1.) You have NOT HAD to read this book (i.e., for a graduate course in chemical thermo), or 2.) You are a sadistic professor who likes to see their students suffer. There is nothing here of any value. The problems are near impossible to solve, and the text does not explain terms at all. The so called ""postulatory approach"" provides zero insight into this subject. If you are looking for a text to learn thermo, then keep looking. If you have to buy this book, you have my prayers. If you have to use this book for a class, then I would HIGHLY suggest that you pick up Sandler's ""Chemical and Engineering Thermodynamics."" You will use it 10X more then Tester's text."
1,Note to Professors: PLEASE DO NOT CHOOSE THIS BOOK!!!!,"I am taking this course as a graduate student and I have taken three previous courses in Thermodynamics. I know less about this subject and am more confused then I was before I read this book. In my undergraduate degree I did really well in the thermodynamics courses I took and felt like I had a good understanding of the topic. You wouldn't think one book could undo three solid semesters of learning Thermodynamics, but it did for me. The title of this book implies that it is application based, but it is just a pure lie. I am completely unsatisfied with this book."
1,One of the worst,It is impossible to understand how a prof can choose this book. I am an grad student and forced to buy this book. This book contains no useful engineering applications whatsoever. It is very confusing and hard to follow. I had to purchase two other thermo books to finally understand what was going on. End of chapter problems are very hard and not enough sample problems. I have too much negative things to say about this book than positive.
2,Disappointing,"This was rather poor, especially after reading Howl's Moving Castle. The plot seemed to be more jumbled than planned, and none of the characters were half as interesting as Sophie or Howl. Don't buy for more than a couple of dollars. Otherwise, all other novels by this author have been well worth the time!"
5,Great reading,I thought it would be more the adventures of Wizard Howl. But it was a great book anyway because it was about him and Sophi though you don't realize who they are.
3,Meh - ok,"Echoing many of the above comments, I found this book to be disappointing after the sparkling charm of ""Howl's."" The primary characters felt comparatively underdeveloped and the writing far less witty, with almost perfunctory cameos from the first story. Overall it read like a draft in need of another couple revisions."
5,Good Book,This was an interesting book. It wasn't as good as the other two in the trilogy; it felt like it was hastily written.The book itself was in great condition for the price I paid.
5,For Castle in the Air,Love the Diane Wynne Jones books; I have read them all. Purchased this one for a friend. The book came lightening fast and in very good condition. Happy with my purchase.
2,publisher error,"Buyer beware! At page 324, there is a completely different book inserted! Pages 325 through 356 are missing and replaced by pages 343-374 of a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT BOOK. This is for HarperCollins' Greenwillow Book, First EOS edition 2008. Now we have to find one that was published correctly."
4,Enjoyable,"I read Howls' Moving Castle because I loved the movie. I enjoyed the book so much I wanted to continue with Castle in the Air. I did have a hard time getting through the first chapter or two. I kept asking myself, ""Where's Howl, Sophie, Calcifer?"" But, once I let go I really enjoyed the story. I thought it was creative and pulled together really well in the end. It brought a smile to my face. If you are looking for a story that continues with Howl, you'll be dissapointed. But, if you want to read a good story that has a little bit of your favorite characters from Howl's Moving Castle, this is a winner."
4,Likeable and funny,"a highly enjoyable romp thru Alladin type Arabia to wet Sussex environs. Although not as poignant as it's predecessor, Howls Moving Castle, Castle in the Air is nonetheless very readable and makes one just as reluctant to put it down. Sophie and Howl are revisited in this book, but it isn't properly a sequel for them as it deals with entirely different characters. Remember the skeleton hopping broom man? Well he features large.Grouchy genies & princesses of all ages, DWJ mixes them all up for this delightful spoof. Kinda romantic but mostly funny watch out for cats and vain carpets.Fans will enjoy it and if you haven't been converted to the DWJ fanclub yet, you're only one book away!"
4,... Review *~*,"I like this book because it had adventures, mysteries, and humour. It reminded me of "" Aladdin."" It was about a carpet sellsman who went on a journey in search of a the princess. My favorite character is Adbullah. He is very positive about everything and won`t stop until he finds the princess. He is also brave. My favorite part was when they first saw the dijnn. I liked that part because it described it very well."
3,Good but not great,"This book is good but not as good as Howl's Moving Castle which is a given since sequels are rarely as good as the ones that come before. I thought that it was a bit slow, and though Howl was in it far more then these rewiews would suggest, I felt that there were some very exciting things that happened of which Howl was a part that were not explained hardly at all in this book such as the war between Ingrey and Strangia and the enchantment of Howl, Sophie, and Calcifer. I would have liked to know more about these, and I feel that it would have made the book more exciting. Plus, the flattery language of the main characters annoyed me almost as much as it annoyed Howl! If I heard one more conversation that begun with something like ""Oh jewel among waitresses"" or ""Oh sapphire among genies"" or something of the like; I'll scream! Other then these things it was a good book."
2,Don't waste your money,"I thought this would be a cute toy for my daughter who loves Mcds, but it is very cheaply made. The cash register broke in 2 days and the food that comes with it ie French fries come in almost like paper holders and were ripped the day we gave it to her. I wouldn't waste money on this product there are much nicer cash registers out there if that's what you are looking for."
3,"""M"" for ""Margaret""","My daughter's Nana bought this for our 3 year old for her birthday. Margaret likes the money, constantly opening the cash register, 'eating' the french fries, and wearing the little visor. She pretends to make us all the foods that come with it. Durability hasn't been an issue...yet. Storage for all the little pieces was a problem until I gave her an ""M"" box to put it all in."
4,Very good!,"It's my first experience at Amazon.com and I was very pleased with the results. The delivery was quick and accurate on the estimate of time, considering I was ordering from Canada. Very satisfied with the toy. My godchild loves it! Very glad I found it on Amazon."
2,A look a like,"Me and my cousin, Jamere couldn't wait to get th Mcdonald Cash register. We spend $... for nothing, at first it was cute ,but quickly it became boring. Only neat thing about it was the play food. Usually Jamere and I would agure about who is going to be the cashier, but we sent most of are time aguring about who can be the cook. So don't buy this item, if you want to spend your dayz bored and sitting in front of a Televison all Day. The Barbie and Auto Cash Register are worth a pretty penny, but i'll buy it."
3,Better cash register sets out there...,"Our two children received this item for Christmas last year and they ended up breaking most of it in record time. They aren't especially hard on toys, either. They did enjoy the french fries (cluster of them), and chicken nuggets but the cash register wasn't that great, nor sturdy. They also liked the clusters of coins and the credit cards. They still use those. But the rest was thrown away by Spring! It was too broken to use. There were electronic troubles as well as trouble with the plastic pieces themselves.The toy has name recognition, certainly, for even the youngest children. But, there wasn't much educational value (especially compared to other cash register type toys) and the durability was a serious issue."
2,You could easily find a better cash register,Especially for a $20-25 toymy kids liked the concept of the Mcds play register but it was very cheaply made IMO.the money was too small(bills) or too big (coin group)the best part of this set was the hat and headset.
4,Dial 'M' for McDonalds,"My 4 year old nephew thoroughly enjoyed this toy, the fake fries and money keeping him occupied for hours on end... especially when he picked up the phrase ""Would you like fries with that?"" How we laughed... until he'd said it 10 times in a row which is when we wondered if we had made the right decision in buying this for the little tyke - especially seeing as he was getting more spotty and developing greasy hair!All in all, it kept him quiet - so 4 stars for that; 1 star from me though as it made us feel old before our years and suddenly realised that this is what he may be doing in 14 years time...Durable but age endearing!"
1,Criticism of Kindle Edition,"This book addresses medieval archaeology and architecture and its text depends on the quality of its images and floor plans. The Kindle Edition does a deplorable job of transferring the images and plans from the print version to this electric edition. It is impossible to make out the graphs, the artwork is miniscule and the floor plans are rendered useless. While it might be nice to save twenty dollars on the Kindle Edition, the hard copy is essential to grasping the author's argument and gaining a firm understanding of gendered architecture."
4,A great medical/mystery thriller!,"This was the first of the Andy Broussard/Kit Franklin mysteries that I had read, that made me wish that I had discovered this series earlier. The medical detail the book is based on is fabulous. The characters, Andy in particular, felt like old friends by the end of the novel. I personally love New Orleans, and I found myself truly back there while reading this book. Although some of his books are hard to find, it is definitely worth the effort to read DJ Donaldson's work."
4,Dark of the sun,"When I heard the main theme of Dark of the sun in Inglourious Basterds, remembered that I been looking for years for a DVD or VHS in Mexico, and after reading some commentaries about the tape, wouldn`t dare to buy it in the States, at those prices."
3,Dated but good,I originally got this because I loved the title track and opening scenes but it really is a cool movie. A precursor to 'Tears of the Sun'
3,Wait for the DVD,"Closely based on the early novel of the same name by Wilbur Smith (River Gods, The Seventh Scroll), this dark, probing story realistically portrays the rebellious period of the Belgan Congo during the 60's. Bruce Curry (Taylor) is the white mercenary leader of a force of black government troops sent inland by train to rescue Europeans cut off in a mining town by anti-government Simbas-and more importantly to retrieve the diamonds stored in the town. As one might expect, Curry's plans quickly go awry. His troops are not dependable, and he has to fight not only Simbas but also his fellow mercenaries and hostile UN peace-keeping forces. As the author intended, there are no heroic characters, and the ending leaves the viewer totally unsatisfied. Taylor is well-cast, but the rest of the acting is very weak. The most brutal scenes have been cut from VHS versions, making the film choppy. One can only hope that this film will make it to DVD."
5,Mercenaries in the Congo,"Rod Taylor plays a Mercenary fighting in the Belgian Congo during the 1960's. Jim Brown is a sergeant in the Congolese Army and a friend of Taylor's. Taylor is asked to put together a train and go ""up country"" to a mining camp and rescue the miners and their families. He recruits another Mercenary who is the leader of a Congolese Army elite unit. On the way they rescue Yvette Mimieux, a plantation owner whose family was killed by the rebels. Once at the mining camp they discover they must wait for the bank vault to open so the diamonds from the mine can be saved. The rebels attack and the train is captured, although Taylor et al escape and then try to rescue the miners. All sorts of action and tons of bullets flying. I like this film and rate it one of my all time favorite ""war"" movies. Note: DVD-R format."
4,DARK OF THE SUN A HIDDEN GEM,"A relatively unknown action classic from the 60's concerning mercenaries in the Congo. Lots pf action, Great score and a very excellent Rod Taylor. Jim Brown also at the height of his limited acting talent. Remaster is good with the sole exception of the elimination of some of the more graphic violent action. Was not available for years on any studio produced VHS or DVD. Quentin Tarantino paid quite a homage to this film in his recent ""Inglorious Basterds,"" with Rod Taylor playing Winston Churchill and the score being used. Love that music."
4,Muscular Action/Adventure Classic,"Rod Taylor fans cheered this ""ultimate Rod"" action piece (with it heart in the right place) only to discover that hardly anyone except (us) diehard fans actually saw it! (This is what video is for, folks!) This is a solid, well-crafted film that deserves a wider audience. RVC"
2,"Forget this VHS, where is the DVD?","I had seen this movie years ago and just borrowed a VHS. It looks like it was cut/edited.Amazon, this would be a great unabridged feature on DVD. Where is it? What is the holdup? And where is The 7th Dawn? Another classic."
3,Makita 743009-6-4-Inch Rubber Pad,Makita 743009-6-4 Inch Rubber PadI miss understood the Pad instructions as being a 4 inch pad and I only received a 2 1/2 pad. The pad itself was in very good shape but I could not use it on the machinery I was working on.
1,"Wrong labeling, wrong part","I was looking for a 4 inch rubber sanding pad that would screw onto my Makita 4inch grinder. Makita #743009-6 is not that part, and this is not a picture of 743009-6. The part I received is only 2-1/2in diameter and does not have a threaded center for attachment, nor does it have a feathered edge as shown in the picture. Somebody got the wrong picture with part # 743009-6."
3,"A little small but works, if you have a flat plain tub floor!","I purchased for a surprise soak in the tub for my loved one this V-day. It worked fine. We just have a bumpy surface in the bottom of our tub that prevented the mat to stick right. The pillow part stuck great along the flat tub surface so I am assuming it would stick to a plain flat tub floor as well. It was a little smaller in length than I hoped for, but it made the tub softer to sit in. I wouldn't have paid twenty dollars for this item ever again so if it's on sale for less, go ahead, it's worth about ten dollars. It's very easy to clean. It has plenty of suction cups. The pillow is flatter than I hoped for I just wished it was thicker for the money."
2,Comfortable but does not stay put,"Suction cups are not adequate to hold this product down and you end up pushing on it the entire time. Wish it had bigger, more powerful suction cups, then it would be a good product. Gave up on it."
1,Flimsy bath mat,"This bath mat is made of very, very thin plastic. The suction cups supposed to hold it fast to the bottom of the tub do not do the job. Save yourself some money and look for something more substantial."
1,Poor quality - suction cups do not work,"I bought one of these bathtub loungers years ago and loved it. I finally threw it out after years of use because it had become so discolored from years of use and I couldn't get it white again.So I bought this thinking it was same or at least similar product. It was horrible. Much lighter weight, cheaply made and the worst feature was that the suction cups simply will not stick. It is not my tub surface because the other one worked so well. I looked on the package, and sure enough, it is made in China.Nothing made in China is acceptable quality and yet it seems that we no longer have a choice. I bought another similar brand, not this one and had same problems and it too was made in China~!!I wish I could find the first one I had which was great and really had to be pulled on hard to get the suction cups to let loose. <Sigh> those were the good ol' days when things were made in US and good quality."
3,Good Book but Not His Best,"After reading the whole series of ""straight Dope"" books, I was disappointed in this book. For starters, it's less than half as long as the others. Also, it contains a lot of repostings from his AOL message board from fans. If I wanted to read postings by the fans, I'd browse them online for free on the newsgroups. It's still a good book with lots of great information told in an entertaining fashion but it doesn't live up to his prior 3 compilations. It's still a ""must read"" for Cecil Adams fans but if you have to choose between this book or one of the others, go for one of the others."
2,Same old stuff,"While entertaining, this collection of Straight Dope columns lacks the ZING of some past columns. The topics are not nearly as interesting, and the answers lack the humor that Cecil is known for. Also, far too short. Let's beef these books back up and reinstill the wit. Perhaps answer some questions that have not appeared in your column already - fresh material!"
4,Another book of Uncle Cecil's collection,"Yet another book from him...If you havent heard about Cecil Adams then let me tell you he's one of the most eccentric ""personages"" ever existed... he claims to know everything about everything and cannot be mistaken... a bit arrogant sometimes he comes again to make mankind a favour and take us all from profound ignorance...Good book for trivia fans...Warning: expect to read almost anything imaginable here on these pages... it's true!"
2,Tortilla Heaven,I bought this movie because it featured George Lopez. George Lopez only came out a few times almost didn't speak. This movie was not funny at all. I bought it for about two dollars and I would have been upset if I had paid more than that.
2,Wonderful Idea - End Result Less Than Hoped For,"The basic premise of this movie is good, the cast is GREAT, the scenery is wonderful but the writing is awful. Too much was going on, there were so many sub-plots that it became tiresome. I wanted to love this movie because I love northern New Mexico and I tried, I really tried, but this movie is a waste of time. I only gave it two stars because the scenery was good."
5,HIghly recommend!,This is the 10th copy of this book that I've given as a gift.......I think that says it all!
2,"Cashing in on ""Buddhism""","This is basically a self-help book. Whether or not it is actually helpful will presumably vary from person to person. But the author seems to have only a passing familiarity with the prevailing pop Buddhism of the day, and she sprinkles it throughout here and there in an entirely superficial way. It's a cynical marketing ploy, although the author herself may not be self-aware enough to recognize it as such."
5,very good book,"The book is amazing. it gives to me a lot of good suggestions. I love also the other book of the same author "" If Buddha had kids."""
4,Helping Friends Career Network recommended reading list!!,"I am recommending this book as a refreshing read for career seekers who feel stuck in trying to figure out what is next in a difficult environment of layoffs and reductions in force. There is a calm in identifying where you really are, why you have such attachments, and being able to see you really are only as stuck as you let yourself be. [...]"
2,not very useful,"this book describes what it means to be stuck. this is a place in your life when you are unhappy with a situation, but stay in it without making required changes and find excuses for staying in that situation.Intresting topic for sure, but the strategies listed are okay. i didnt find them too useful. Infact I found radical acceptance so much more useful and new. this book recycles most of what you already know, like make space and be open to change. there is too many sub headings and she tries to cram too much information into the book, making it confusing and boring. i personally did not find the book useful and wish I hadn't got it."
5,Kasl is my inspiration,"Charlotte Kasl writing has always been is one of the most brilliant around. Practical, straightforward, useful to issues that we all face in life. If you have even half a brain you will find out where you are stuck, get in our in our world, and then do something you've never done before, (hopefully to help others or the environment) and then grow."
3,Good cheap cane,"I used this cane for a several weeks to transition off of crutches and it held up very well. My only complaint would be that occasionally the rubber stoppers on the top of each section would come loose. There was never any risk of collapse, and it was just a minor annoyance which is easily overlooked considering the cheap price. I would recommend this cane to anyone who needs a sturdy folding cane for a temporary timeframe. No idea how it will last long term.Pros:*Super cheap*Foldable so it can be stashed easily*Did not loosen up under constant use for 4 weeks*Good adjustment that didn't loosen upCons:*Lots of minor chips in handle after a few weeks*Rubber stoppers in the top of each section can come loose"
4,My knee surgery,"I had meniscus surgery and had to use a can for a while afterwards. This worked just fine and the folding mechanism actually made it fairly convenient to carry around in a bag.I had no complaints. And it didn't look absurdly like something my grandfather would have used, which was nice.If it matters, I'm 5'10 / normal weight."
3,Folding cane,"The cane does the job. It was easy to adjust to my height. However, I learned that one has to be careful with it. I yanked it out of a pack sleeve and a section caught on a compression strap. I broke the shock cork and had to buy a length of it and repair the cane. It is good as new now."
5,PERFECT,This product is perfect for me. It is strong but light weight. Because it folds up it is easy to put in the pocket of my wheel chair or scooter. In a restraunt it fits in my purse instead of trying to hang it on the back of the chair. The size is easily adjustable. I like it alot.
4,Good product,"Nice grip and the perfect height at 5'10"". Convenient if you have to store in a small space. It is also very lite."
5,One of the best behind the scene books ever!!!!,I loved it it was the best one yet! I would also like to see one on voyager. I love the renderings and the concept sketches.
3,A suitable companion to the film,"I don't know if it was a problem with a particular print run of this book, but the copy I bought from a local bookstore was very badly bound, and several pages came adrift while I was reading it. This struck me as highly unusual, since most S&S books are excellently bound. However, the book itself is beautfully designed, and has a wealth of information about the film making process. However, it is a little on the small side, and could have been more like John Eaves's ""Next Generation Sketchbook"". A good book in general, it loses stars because of the poor binding and small size."
2,DoomZZZZZZZ Day,"This book was difficult to finish, the first one was better but not great either. As a big fan of spiderman, Iron Man and Dr Doom. I expected more. Too much time spent with the B.O.R.I.N.G acronym evildoers. Doom only showed up at the end, was thwarted, and will return for book 3"
3,"Good book, but not as good as the first one.","I thought that this book was a little bit to technical. It strayed away from fighting a lot talk about other things. Baron Von Strucker was evil enough, but there should have been more Doctor Doom. It was well written just like the first book. It is a definite must read if you are gonna follow the trilogy. I eagerly await the next book"
1,Dont buy ....this is junk,This is the worst piece of outdoor equipment I have recently had the dipleasure of testing. It worked ok for one week until it decided to fall apart on me during normal operation. The cheap locking mechanism simply fell off and rendered the lid inoperable. The lid doesnt open all the way to begin with so it made it difficult to use. Poorly designed and overpriced for what it is is. I wouldnt be surprised if this is made in China...really poor quality stuff.
2,not that funny,"This programme surprised me as not veryy funny in lots of ways. By trying to be as offending and gross as possible, Sarah Silverman actually achieves the opposite: she bores us to death at times. There is a great lack in consistency in the writing which makes it very difficult to watch any episode in its entirety."
2,Sarah Silverman Show,"I didn't really think this was that funny. I've seen clips and stand up that Sarah Silverman has done, but I didn't find her show funny."
1,Save the money. Buy a pizza. Give to charity. Whatever...,"You never know what you're going to get when you buy a comedy. You hope, at least, if it's not hilarious, there will still be a few laughs. I haven't found one in this DVD. One of the main things you need is to like the comedian, in some small way, but Silverman is beyond that. She's a Kostanza without Larry David's redeeming genius for observation. Which is to say she annoys, she's puerile, petty, etc. etc. and there's just nothing funny about her. As cheap as it is, this is still a waste of money. If you turned her on, free to air, you'd change the channel. You'd find more laughs on re-runs of Gilligan's Island."
1,The Worst Show Currently On TV,This is the worst written show on TV. For some reason people confuse being a biggot with being funny.The worst Show on TV next to anything on Lifetime
2,Not funny,"Just not funny, It didn't do anything for me and was not at all amusing. I could not watch it after the first scene."
5,Love SS,"Sarah Silverman is the cutest, funniest, awesome-est comedienne in the entire world. Anybody who doesn't love her is a pootie-butt. Jon Hamm as the cable guy? C'mon...It doesn't get better than that."
2,"Choose the backhoe, front loader or dump truck instead...",This is a great looking truck that really excited my 4-year old at first. It quickly became frustrating for him because the arm would collapse and the string would come undone and get jammed. We have the other 3 trucks in this line and absolutely love them. Skip the crane!
3,Not their best effort,"Growing up with Tonka in the 60's and 70's, I was surprised at the ammount of plastic now used for various parts. Also, the handle that is supposed to ""lock"" into one of two positions, does not lock. I had to stick a rolled up piece of cardboard in it to keep it from continually falling down. The crane itself is thin plastic, and I do not expect it to last. My advice; buy a vintage one on e-bay."
1,unsafe and frustrating,"We got this for our 3-year-old son last Christmas, and he was thrilled with it. He played with it for about 5 minutes and was very frustrated because the arm would not stay in place, it kept crashing down no matter how securely kid (or parents) would try to set it in place. Unsafe for fingers or anyone in the way of the arm when it goes. We tried playing with it for a few days and ended up exchanging it for the excavator instead, which was a big disappointment -- this had been his very favorite thing under the tree. Extremely poor engineering on this one."
4,A Fix For The String,"I recently purchased the crane, excavator, front loader, etc... The very first time he tried to use it the bucket came off the string. He also has the mini one with the same problem. After you tie it back on put a bead of hot glue on both sides of the knot and press it between your fingers just before it hardens. Neither knot has slipped since! We just found a Tonka track bulldozer that my husband played with 30 years ago and it still works! My son has added it to his fleet. I'm confident these will be around for his kids too!!"
2,A frustrating toy,"My son loves all the Tonka vehicles, but this one frustrates him. The crane mechanism comes out of the slot easily. It also tips over easily. It doesn't balance very well when lifting something. It is also awkward to move and store due to the crane part."
3,danger,Not safe for little or big fingers. The crane arm comes smashing down on little hands. Very disappointing. Surprised Tonka did not catch this.
2,Doesn't do the Tonka name proud....,"While it's not the cool all-metal stuff that I remember, I know my son enjoyed playing with this. At least UNTIL the lever that keeps the crane up broke. It's a shoddy piece of plastic wrapped by a thin tin shell. I'm very unhappy with this. And as for my son.. it's no fun seeing a 3-year-old cry..."
5,How to keep boys busy for hours - Tonka,This Tonka truck will last for a long time. Boys play with it in sand for hours. Could not hire a better babysitter.
1,Tonka went to plastic,"I was very disappointed in this Tonka Truck along with several others that I bought. I was surprised to see that Tonka trucks are now made up of plastic. I kept it as it was a gift for a little boy who really wanted this truck, otherwise I would have sent it back."
2,Bargain table buy,"Rage Of Mages Two could have been a good game. It's not but it could have been if the developers had just spent a bit more time on it. The main problem is that the game play works on the questing buddy theory and the little buggers won't stay in formation. It does not matter to the game if you use auto formation, which is a feature of the game that is TOTALLY USELESS, or if you try to put them in formation yourself. Inevitably your little mage who has a health of like 30 and is only useful in that she heals will run to the front and die a horrible death. After only two days of this I wish that I could hear her scream while she died.Also, the developers chose to create almost impossible scenarios early in the game before the characters have either the experience or the equipment to fight the swarms of monsters that the developers substituted for creative game play. Who needs creativity for an RPG game when you can just use hordes of monsters."
3,a typical cheesy cd to go with cheesy chick movies,this cd is soppy. a mixture of good and [bad] songs. number 3 makes gemma cry! how sad!
1,confusing beginner's book,"The book has very few species, a terrible index, discusses plants it has no photos of, and seems to jump all over. If one of my past college students had given me this book as a report, i'd have given them a C-. Poor organization, repeats itself, constant references to peat filtration, but no advice on the proper way to do it... really a disappointing conglomeration that leaves the user wondering what in the world is the best way to set up a planted aquarium. Don't buy."
1,Don't bother buying this book.,"I have read a lot of aquarium and plant books but this is an example of a poor book. It looks like the publishes went to the library and collected a bunch of ideas from other books and through them together. I can't say that they give any bad advice, except in my opinion they mislabled two plants. Plus, there is a lack of a coherent theme through the book. They combine a few ideas that IMHO don't work together (this is from personal experience). Also the section on water chemistry is confusing, and before I read the book I knew it flat. The pictures are okay except they are all stock photos and you will see them someplace else in other books. Don't waste you money on this book. I would give it zero stars if I could."
3,A Good Beginner's Reference,"This is a good, inexpensive book with basic information on how to set up a planted aquarium. I'd recommend this book in conjunction with Barry James' A Fishkeeper's Guide to Aquarium Plants. Although there are a few mistakes (photos of Riccia fluitan and Java moss have been switched), you can't beat the amount of info you get for the price."
2,"It's just ""OK""","Less than impressive small, thin paperback. Profiles only a small amount of species. There are at least a few errors: mislabeled photos and incorrectly identified species of plants and fish."
2,bad!!!,"I have one word for this book, BAD!. The content of the book was very thin, there many plant references but hardly any information on them. It was basically just a picture book of plants, not the reference guide it is made out to be."
1,Not Very Useful,"I bought this thinking it would help me. It didn't. Also in the back of the book, they have Riccia and Java Moss mixed up. The pictures are switched backwards. I don't recommend this book if you are going to invest your time and money into a plant tank. There are better books out there people."
3,check point from chad's toolbox,"Well, this might be great. I bought it for a gift and the seller took it out of the original packaging so he could ingrave his websight and scratch it."
4,Practical Advice for AltSex Folks,"This is an excellent, helpful guide to etiquette for folks who didn't think Miss Manners would work for them - although, as Drew slyly implies, she could! The book offers common-sense advice told humorously and well for folks who move regularly in non-traditional roles and relationship structures. I hope everyone in these categories (and really, who isn't?) gives it a read."
5,this book is a to-do list on steroids!,"I really liked this book. I got it expecting another ""goal planner"" to-do list, but decided to jump on it when it came up as a package with the other David Hooper book. It really helped me a lot more than just a simple list. Since getting it, I have had some really productive days and weeks. I recommend this book for anybody and not just those people in the music business!! Everybody could benefit from this book!"
2,WHY BUY THE ARCHIVES WHEN YOU CAN GET THE SAME GAMES CHEAPER!,"This Archives is a great game collection. But it only includes the first five games. I prefer Might and Magic VI: The Mandate of Heaven Special Edition. It offers the first five games as a bonus, AND includes the full version of six too. The kicker is, it's usally found MUCH CHEAPER elsewhere on AMAZON.COM"
5,worth the money!,This is a very inexpensive way to have fresh air in your house without the big project of putting in real screen doors.
2,Good Concept - Poor Execution,"The concept was great, enjoy the sunshine and breeze without the pests. Only thing is, it fell down. This product would still work if a stronger adhesive tape was used from end to end of the product, instead of the 3 individual small pieces that are included in the packaging."
3,"Info. is great, music is too loud","The speakers in this film are renowned authors, religious and spiritual practitioners, as well as those who have had near death and other spiritual experiences. I feel the information is very good and I remained interested throughout the film. I would give it five stars except for the fact that the music that is suppossed to be in the background is so loud that it is often in the foreground! I had difficulty hearing some of the speakers because of the music. I was disapointed that I may have lost out of some of the information due to the music (I have no hearing problems). There is no close captioning available on this DVD either. I chose to rent the movie and not buy it because of the sound issues."
3,Need to watch several times,"I cannot rate this DVD higher than three stars because I had a difficult time understanding much of what was spoken with the loud music background. This difficulty was enhanced with those speaking with a foreign accent. The graphics were wonderful, and perhaps with further viewing I will be able to hear more of what some people were saying. The subject is fascinating and very worthwhile for anyone asking what happens to use when we die and how we should live our lives until then."
2,Disappointing,"Not bad but I was expecting more out of this video. Like more experiential / fact based stories. Too much of the video is spent with Neale Donald Walsch talking in his wispy, low, mumbling, rambling, ""spiritual"" voice. Of all the people in the video interviewed he was by far the least credible and least interesting. On the flip side very little time is spent with Brian Weiss who has decades of research into past life regressions and can speak more from a fact based / clinical perspective. The film spent too much time with the wrong people and very little time with the right people. BnB Beatles Depot."
2,Infinity the ultimate trip beyond death,I was really not impressed with this dvd.I do think there is a lot more written material that covers this most important subject better.I hoped for more from Mr Braden.There is too much just coloured swirling patterns going on that don't relate to anything at all.
2,Sensory Overload,"I'm familiar with all the speakers. I bought this believing it may assist a couple of my clients who are about to transition through death. But after watching it I realized I didn't wish to share it.The content of the speakers was alright; my complaints have to do with the production.The music that played nonstop through the entire presentation was TOO LOUD and I found it wore on my nerves after just a little time. It distracted from the speakers' words and many times I strained to make out what they were saying. Visual montages especially the fractals though lovely were excessive - both hypnotic and overstimulating.There also seemed to be little continuity running throughout the movie - was more of separate vignettes of individual teachers. The best parts were when they shared from their own personal experience, rather than giving teachings.I congratulate the makers for their attempts to convey info on a complex topic, but I cannot recommend this dvd."
3,Many interesting . .,stories and experiences but I was disappointed that I bought a video that I will probably never watch again. Next time I will borrow from the Library before buying.
5,Interesting people and ideas,This was a very interesting documentary. The people interviewed gave unique viewpoints and idea. I have been been touch by death very deeply and found insights in unexpected places. This movie was one of those many places. I recommend it to anyone asking questions that can never be answered except by self-discovery and exploration.
5,Stupendous!,"I always loved listening to Dannion Brinkley speak, and he is still awesome. But I also loved Renate, Neale and others in this wonderful DVD about the afterlife. Amazing and refreshing to watch, and aligned with my beliefs."
4,Just what was missing in the new Highlander,"We bought a 2010 Highlander this spring and found that we really missed the temperature gauge that was in previous vehicle. I contacted Toyota and that they wanted a golden egg for an after the fact installation, so we checked out after market on our own. We got the first one, the 36401 camlock, because all I could get for information was that ""most foreign cars have camlock mirrors."" It took about five minutes to find out that it is a ""wedge"" type in the new Highlander. Sent the camlock back and got the wedge style instead. Mirror installed easily, routing the temperature probe and running the wire was an hour or so in length to do. Wiring was a little frustrating because I don't get along well with those little plastic pinch the wire connectors. Overall it is a fantastic mirror and I would have given it 5 stars if the instructions had been a little more application specific."
1,Poor product,"This product was advertised as a brand new JVC Camcorder charger compatible with a variety of JVC batteries including a JVC BN-V14U. The charger is actually a Chinese import with no manufacturer listed on the container, enclosed paperwork or on any part. It was certainly not manufactured by JVC. The paperwork states that the charger is compatible with lithium batteries only. The JVC BN-V14U battery from my camera is too wide to fit into the charger and happens to be a Ni-Cad. battery instead of lithium."
3,Great stuff,"The only way you have have both a septic tank and a disposal.... works as advertised, one bottle lasts a long time."
3,new to use,having just received this disposal and I can't comment on how well the replacement bio charge will work but it is very easy to install
5,Indespensable,This is the necessary fluid for an EXCELLENT disposal to be used with septic systems. Have never had a problem
2,InSinkErator cartridge,I have used these for years. I bought 5 or 6 for my daughter and me. So far the first one did not eject any fluid into thedisposal as the button did not go up. I have another one in now and I am not sure it is working either.
2,re-read book,I read this book some 30+ years ago and was truly amazed at understanding the kind of treatment that was meeted out by the Russions so many years ago. I was again taken by this horrible history.
5,A hair junkie's all-time favorite!,"I have just about used every shampoo out there in my 40+ years and this is hands down my favorite! I have fine, straight hair and this makes me look like I have tons of hair. No flat onion head for me. I just stumbled upon this product on one of my ""gotta try something new"" trips and I believe my hunting for the perfect product has ended. Thank You, Nirvana!"
5,Great film and great DVD,This film is a hidden gem from a great director! This Chinese import is really good quality - it seems even better than whatever version I rented from Netflix. The screenplay is genius. It has Johnny Depp and Vincent Gallo. How can you go wrong?
3,Lewis Adds Magic to Bizzare Dream,"This 0 Region version of ""Arizona Dream"" offers a crystal clear picture and Dolby Sound. The viewer can choose English or Chinese subtitles, but they do not appear unless the option is selected.The film itself is very off-the-beaten path. Akin to ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" in that Depp's character is the one telling the story throughout.By far the highlight of the film is Jerry Lewis. The stellar comedian-actor-director-producer plays part himself, part a classic Paramount character, and part Jerry Langford (from ""The King of Comedy""). The film is worth a gander even if you simply Fast Forward to his parts.""Arizona Dream"" is like a piece of art and open to a wide range of viewpoints. For example, who is dreaming? Axel and his Uncle Leo (Lewis) or their Inuit counterparts?"
3,STILL no US version on DVD,"Yet another non US version of this movie. I believe there is a market for dvd's in the United States. Maybe if they'd edit in some action sequences and dub in Johnny Depp saying ""I'm getting too old for this sh**"" it could be released here. . . .blah. The movie itself is a 4 to 5--gave it 3 because of the above issue."
5,God's plan is the only way to go...,"This is a great book for enhancement of your belief in God, it will give you the teaching you need to live a life the way God wants you to live. I recommend everyone that beleives in God to purchase this book. You won't be sorry..."
3,Buyer Beware - Multiple Printing Yrs - How to Apply the Bible,"I purchased How to Apply the Bible book based on the 2002 printing year listed but received a version printed in 1999 instead. I deliberately opted not to purchase a 1999 version but got it anyway. There is a current 2009 printing/version that has a different cover than the one posted on Amazon. The positive part of this transaction is that the book has not really changed a lot. However, I did end up having to purchase another version and use the 1999 book as a workbook. Lesson learned: I should have contacted the seller to verify that I would be receiving a book printed in the year I had selected and not what was left in stock."
4,Useful,"Very useful silicone case, it has almost 4 years in use, and it is in perfect shape. The only detail I didn't like was the inner silicone circle, it makes difficult to control the touch wheel. I cut it off."
4,Nice case with tricky plastic protector sheets,"Once assembled, a very nice case. The sticky plastic protector sheets have plastic sheets that must be peeled off themselves. These discarded sheets carry the stickers that I at first tried to peel off so they are really not an issue that has been mentioned in the reviews. The silicone case fits snugly on the new 80 GB ""classic"" iPods. The scroll wheel is not quite as responsive with the silicone covering - I haven't been able to do the scrolling in ""high gear"" and that makes it hard to navigate the artist list, for example, of a large library. Haven't used the armband but would not expect it to be great."
3,silicone cover,"i wanted this for running but i read a review after buying that it wont hold well for running, otherwise its done a good job protecting my already scratched ipod but the plastic covers were tedious and didnt have proper instructions."
3,Armband?!,The strap is long enough but not comfortable. I took it to work and ended up with three bruises on my arm because of it! There isn't any support or comfort. The case works well.The screen protectors were old and/or cheap. The placement stickers didn't come off all the way so I have gunk on my screen and iPOD's backside.
4,only 2/3 of order came,The skin and the screen protectors came and they were exactly as described. Put them on immediately. The armband did not come.
1,Ipod silocone case,Although the product descripstion is exactly what you get. I did not like the way it fit the Ipod. Also The silicone that goes over the track wheel makes it very hard for the track wheel to recognize that it is supposed to be doing something. In the end I decided to chuck the case and leave the Ipod caseless.
2,Looks great but lacking:,"I purchased the black silicone case package for my 80g iPod Classic and it looks sick on the iPod but the flexibility of the material makes it extremely difficult to operate the clickwheel, sometimes I have to reach under the casing to just select my music, adjust volume, and scroll through my music lists. Over time it seems the silicone material has stretched out making it even more frustrating to use the clickwheel.The screen protector is great except that it came with an annoying sticker on it and removing it left behind an unattractive sticky film that was impossible to remove.The armband itself was big, bulky, unattractive, and didn't seem to work very well without cutting off the circulation to my arm - that was thrown out within the first week.I wouldn't reccommend this product, for the price you could find something much more iPod user friendly."
2,Don't Be Fooled,"I recently purchased the case that was supposedly designed for the new 6th generation 80gb ipod classic. What I got was a case for the 5th gen 30gb ipod. They are about the same size, but not exactly, so the case is a bit loose fitting. I guess it could have been a shipping error, but its more likely that they haven't actually come out with a case for the 6th gens yet."
4,Better than I thought.,"I bought this ring last year, we had planned to spend more on our wedding bands but then my mother became ill and we cancelled the big day. We ended up just going to the courthouse and signing the papers, but before that we were in a pinch to rush our rings! This one was the right price and decent quality. When I received it, I was pleasantly surprised, sure the diamonds aren't the best quality ever (hello, its a <$100 diamond ring) but they were larger and better than I expected. I've worn it everyday for the last year and have yet to have to re-dip the gold, which is nice. Overall I'd do it again :)"
3,good ring for the price,"I was shopping last minute for a new ring and came upon exactly the style that I was looking for, at much less price than I anticipated spending. I would absolutely shop with them again."
2,a little different than i expected,"like previously mentioned, the rings are sized a bit large. the diamonds are not the best quality but for the price it is expected. you can't tell from the picture but the two strips of gold forming the channel for the diamonds actually sticks up a little. from the side the ring does not make a perfect circle but a slight oval shape. it's not necessarily bad, just different. My girlfriend really liked the ring, but if i had to do it again i would spend a little more money and get a ring of nicer quality. if you are planning on buying the ring, i suggest going a half size, maybe even a size smaller."
2,Not very helpful,I didn't find this book very helpful. It was mildly entertaining and I read it in about 30 minutes. Just not detailed enough to be helpful.
4,Smaller than I thought,Other reviewers said these were long and graceful. Not so with the pair I received. I still LIKE them - they are sturdy and I love the blue color with the gold flecks - they were just much smaller than I had anticipated.
4,Pretty Lapis Earrings,"Very pretty Lapis Lazuli earrings! They were a little bigger than I had expected! I have a lapis Lazuli pendant that has more gold specks in it than the lapis on the earrings but they are still very pretty! I like the silver and small sapphire detail. They arrived quickly also, only three days after ordering!"
5,Fabulous book for any child!!,"I am a kindergarten teacher in Georgia, and when I read the story to my students they LOVED it! They loved the Lucy and all the things that she did. They wanted to hear the story over and over and over. They loved to chime in on parts that they knew, and to laugh at all the crazy things she did. It is definately a book that you should add to your collection. I feel like it will be a story that a child will enjoy for a lifetime."
5,Includes a good CD demo,"I have two other iMovie2 books, but I put out the money for this one because not only does it contains quite a few other techniques not found in other books, but because the attached CD comes only with sample movie clips of camera and editing techniques discussed in the book. It also includes among other things shareware and demo software like Adobe After Effects, sound effect utilities, graphic converter, MoviEffects to use with QT movies.I wouldn't say this is the best iMovie2 book, but the author does a good job outlining, laying out, and explaining editing procedures and techniques. It's not that iMovie2 is a difficult program to learn or use, but it's just that books like these provide insightful strategies that enable you to get more out of the program. I certaintly recommend this book for first time and intermediate users of iMovie2."
5,Great,I usually am a fragrancenet.com shopper but I found this cologne even cheaper on amazon. I wouldn't start buying all my perfumes from amazon however this was a good find. Bought for my boyfriends dad as he was constantly wearing my boyfriends same one lol. Smells legit :)
1,Not For Me,"I own more than 50 colognes from the best designers. This one gives me a headache at just one sniff. Very synthetic and annoying on first spray - smells like chemical (rather than high quality cologne). Had bought blindly on the comments. If you think I do not know what I am talking about - let me tell you - I know other colognes that smell almost the same or exactly the same. In fact this smells EXACTLY - yes EXACTLY likeXeryus Rouge for Men by Givenchy 3.3oz 100ml EDT Spray. Dries down to an overtly feminine floral/vanilla base. Extremely dissatisfied. However, since both the colognes are extremely popular, it seems there are people who like this kind fragrances. My suggestion is always buy cologne only after sampling it in person from any store since preferences vary widely. You may love this or hate this. Amazon does not accept returns for fragrances."
1,WAY WAY TOO SWEET THAT STINKS,IT IS NOT CITRUS. TOO TOO SWEET IT STINKS. BECARE FULL IF YOU THINK IT IS CITRUS BECAUSE IS NOT!
2,Too sweet!,1. Too sweet. Felt like I was spraying sugar on me.2. Fragrance did not last even for 3 hours even with 4-5 sprays. And its a EDP for gods sake!
1,"Dissapointed, Expected more","I always pay attention and try to be very carefull about products review before buying them over the internet. After reading all the good comments and positive feedbacks about the Hanae Mori i was excited about it, but unfornetlly it didnt go like that. The perfume turned out to be a Complete waste of money, the smell is horrible ; it actually smells like dirt combined with sweat, The smells doesnt even last.... If you plan on buying this tryit out first before wasting your money...."
4,Must Buy,"This eau de Parfum is a most buy, for this price u are not going to regret it, it can get any better than this, great oriental woody fragranceProjection 7/10Sillage 7/10Longevity 8-10 hrs"
5,Thank you!,"everything is fine: price, shipping. Bought it as a gift, otherwise i would buy a tester :) go to a store try it first then order here/"
3,Smells okay,Each persons unique scent plays a factor into the overall scent of a cologne. It seems like a summer scent to me as well as not lasting on me more than 5 or 6 hours. I would not purchase this cologne again for myself.
3,Slightly dissapointed,"Not the greatest scent but still O.K.I prefer Hugo Boss Pure,Diesel Fuel, and Curve.The fragrance is quite light,almost too light."
5,Hanae Mori one of The Best Signature Fragrances!,"Hanae Mori is the first EDP I've purchased and I absolutely LOVE IT! I get plenty of complements from the Ladies too!I Highly recommend that you add this EDP fragrance to your collection! BTW... the scent lasts a long time, which is a plus!"
4,hanae mori for men,very nice not over powering. I was looking for a day after shave and have been using eau savage for years.
5,Quickly became my new favorite,"This colgone is one of the best i've ever had. Constantly getting compliments on it. Goes from day to night quite well, and is perfect for a summer scent. Clean, crisp, and lingering. Would recommend getting the big bottle, its going to go fast."
4,Good record!!,"This is actually Taba co's second cd and a lot more mature than it's first product. ""Por el camino"" and ""Latino"" are very good tracks and ""El Cantante"" is a rock remake of Hector Lavoe hit and they do an awesome job!! A great record for your Rock en espanol collection!!"
4,Good Account Marred by Some Dubious Secondary Resources,"This book is really about the life of Muriel Humphreys who was the brains of the Outfit since the Capone days. Much of the material is new, coming as it does from his Widow and her recounting of her knowledge of Humprheys' life in the Outfit that fills in some of the gaps of what was previously known of the shadowy history of the Chicago Mob.I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the true workings of Chicago Organized Crime with the caveat to beware of some of the accounts described in the book. Be sure to read the footnotes, for some of the secondary sources the author uses are of dubious worth and validity."
2,"Too Many Trees, Not Enough Forest","Russo is certainly a skilled researcher. However, this book is so jam-packed with details the facts end up choking each other, like weeds in a poorly tended garden. Rather than arranging his narrative chronologically, Russo might have done better to organize it thematically or in some other way that tied the factual tidbits together more tightly. His last chapter, in which he notes the irony that many of the Outfit's ""rackets"" are now legal and monopolized by governments and corporations, feels tacked-on and does not flow from the rest of the book. A disappoitment."
2,Strays off topic plenty,"Obviously the authors obsession with the kennedy family led him to write an entire book leading up to that. In addition to questionable sources particulary Jeanne Humpfreys and at times a confusing and exausting style of writing the book is just plain dull at times particualry the Joe Kennedy chapters. For the authors apparent worship of Curly Humpfreys he could at least explain his union take overs better. Sorry Gus, close but no cigar"
1,Mythology and Conspiracy Disguised as Fact,"This book averages an error per page, some minor and some major. He has dead characters doing things years after their funeral, makes wild accusations about Bing Crosby, Jean Harlow and Joan Crawford... he pushes the conspiracy of a Mafia-Kennedy connection... in some cases, he doesn't get the names right (Colosimo's first name was Vincezno, not Giacomo). And even in basic geography he is confused -- calling Indiana southWEST of Illinois. I am strongly considering starting a website devoted to this book's errors. While the broad story is true, even the slightest closer inspection shows endless flaws. Any reader not knowledgeable about organized crime is going to finish this book and be full of tidbits on events that never happened... and if they can't sort fact from fiction, the whole book becomes a waste of time as a historical source. How Russo was nominated for a Pulitzer defies all reason, and Pileggi's praise only makes me lose faith in Pileggi."
2,"Well-researched, not well-written","Russo definitely did his homework, but there are a couple of nuisances:-definitely ""goes local"", being too sympathetic to the gangsters. I think he wants to be one.-poorly edited-seems to give uncommon nicknames to the gangsters and runs with them. People in Chicago know Giancana as ""Momo"", not ""Mooney"", and Accardo as Tony Accardo, not ""Joe Batters""It's a decent enough read I suppose, as it does tell the story of the link between the political and criminal powers. But Russo consistently tries to compare corporate swindling to outright murder, and like I said, he seems too much to sympathize with his subjects.In my mind there are too many books out there to recommend ""The Outfit""."
5,amazing!!,"short summary of an encyclpedic and well-documented history of how chicago works. i've lived close enough to know that russo captured the feel,"
5,"Great Book, Not sure Tony Accardo is pictured on cover","I thoroughly enjoyed the book. I maybe have read too many of these books, but it does not look like they have the right image for Tony Accardo on the cover. Just a minor point, but I have several books with his images as a young man and the image second from the left does not look like him. Minor point. The author is detailed in how the Outfit used any and all means to make money! Unions, musician, booze, betting, protection ""tax"", and influencing authorities (politicians, law enforcement, judges et al) to get what they wanted. Power and Influence! Great read and one you may go back to for reference."
2,not very effective.,"The flies are well ahead of me in this death race. So far, the score is: flies 50, me 0."
1,DOES NOT WORK,"Arrived, poorly packaged, not in box as pictured.Does not take AA, as advertised but instead 2 D batteries.In any case, item did not work at all, no light indicator, no current, when I looked inside, saw that wire was loose, broken free from its connection.Have used this general type of swatter before, without problems. This particular model, though, is total crap."
2,Bad Buy,Bought this to keep around the house when needed. First night I took it outside near a light to test it out. Worked great for about 2 mins until something broke internally and no longer worked. Emailed the seller and company for a warranty or a new one. They ignored the email and did not reply. Was fun for the first day anyway.
1,Stopped working after two kills....,"Saw a co-worker using one of a similar design. I ordered this one and was quite happy with the fast shipping. Right out of the box I had to tape the battery door shut. I can live that. I put in fresh batteries and killed two flies immediately. Just held it up near the window and they flew against it. POW. Awesome. You could hear the capacitor emit a high pitched whine when it charged up as you pressed the button. Then nothing. The red light would come on, but no discharge. The third fly literally crawled through the mesh and out the other side. Twice. I tried another set of batteries. Red light, no discharge. I took the unit apart and all the soldering appeared to be intact. No burnt areas. Straight into the trash. Glad it was fairly inexpensive."
5,This thing is awesome!,"So far, I've killed ~200 flies of various sizes (ranging from babies to golf ball sized), moths, and bees. This thing is AWESOME. It is quite satisfying to hear the loud POP! when you hit the fly. The swatter doesn't use much power - the same D batteries have been in mine for several months. Beware though, if you leave the fly on the swatter and hold down the button, the bug starts to burn and smoke. I recommend ""sweeping"" forward with the swatter to hit the bug rather than using this as a traditional fly swatter and hitting the bug. Definitely worth the $10 I paid for it."
3,Clean windows!,"How many times have you trap the fly under the fly swatter and it flies away? I hate that, but with this fly swatter that is not a problem anymore. I try one before and that is why I bought it. They are very popular in other countries. The only problem with this particular one is that it is big. I think that a change in the design would make a big difference in the usability of the product. Overall it works fine."
4,Fun and effective,"This item was a present for my husbands birthday. It really packs a punch, we live in Louisiana so there are roaches outside and it even managed to zap them. I would recommend not touching it with your hands/fingers as it DOES hurt :)"
3,"It was okay, twice","The fly swatter was cool, I got to kill one fly with it, then after a few quick repeated zaps in rapid succession of a centipede like thing on my bathroom floor, the wiring fried itself, and I was forced to get a cheaper one at Walmart."
2,"Review made on Apr 22th, 2008","I bought this because I thought if it uses 2 'D' Batteries there should be more zapping power -therefore, it will kill bugs faster, right? ... but the air doesn't go easily through so its a bit harder to catch them. Also, the size of the round part is not big enough. Before, I was using the double AA batteries operated and it was pretty easy to handle, easy to catch bugs but the only problem it was kinda week at the time to kill insects or bugs.I recommend try another model/brand. Maybe, other brands has the combination of both: power and handling.good luck"
3,so so,It will kill an insect however the screen on the product makes it difficult for flying insects to penetrate through to enter the zapper.You need to swing it very hard to properly work which can be difficult.
4,Fly zapper.,"It works great, but it kind of scares me! My husband loves it though and he patrols the house looking for prey."
2,They have a deceptive ad,"The Flyswatter with the 2 aa batteries works great. This one can't kill larger bugs as the cover on the electric plate doesn't give the space needed to get the bug onto the charge plate.So do get the ""cheap one with the 2 aa batteries"" as this one is actually that too, except with the cover plate causing it only to work with bugs which are very small like a mosquito.Flys are too big for it ......."
1,Not so good,"I bought this for my dad and he initially loved it...but after 3 weeks of use the swatter wouldn't charge up any more. We changed batteries numerous times but it never worked. I ended up buying another one from another vendor and that one works just fine. Not sure what the deal with this one was. No reflection on this seller, I guess it was just a bum model."
2,Dissappointed in this one,"First I tried NiMh batteries.. don't bother, they seemed to be hit and miss as to whether it worked.Then I went with Alkaline as recommeded, but many bugs just bounce off as the outer metal ""protective"" grids must be hitting them, then after using it for about 5 minutes, it seemed to not work at all until you give it a rest?Maybe mine is defective... as cheap as its made, its entirely possible QA is limited!When I first turn it on, I get about 1250 Volts, then after about a minute, it drops to 950 or so, then after several minutes, it won't even zap.. then when I test it, it's only getting 50 - 75 volts or so.... maybe dampness shorts it out after frying spiders at night with the dew?"
3,Harbor Freight has them...,"I have three! But I had to return two that were dead in the wrapper before I had three that worked. A neighbor returned one too. They work pretty well, but seems they have a high infant mortality rate."
1,Using the 1500 volt fly swatter,"The old models of this item (2 AA) batteries were lighter, more agile and very effective when in combat with flying insects.This new model (two, relatively expensive size D batteries) is heavy, cumbersome and not as effective. While the greater battery power does yield higher voltage, it's an ""overkill"" situation. 1500 volts causes the insects to literally explode. There is a stench of death left in the room following the demise of the insect.The loud pop scares my dog and the stink makes the dog leave the room."
4,bigger and heavier,"i bought this bug zapper to replace one that died after about three years of faithful use, and i just thought people should note that this one uses two size D batteries, thus making the handle a lot heavier and wider than my previos one which used two AA batteries. i haven't had a chance to use it yet, but if it works like the other, i highly recommend these for killing mosquitos. i've never tried to zap larger bugs."
3,"fun, but....",Instructions said it uses a 1.5 battery but it obviously needed 2 size D ones instead. Haven't been able to swat a fly with it yet which was my original intent. May have to wait again til bug season next year to test out
4,bug zapper,The racket works well for small insects or spiders. The two AA batteries do not seem strong enough to knock down larger insects such as wasps. I ordered a second zapper thinking I was getting one that required larger batteries. Not so. the replacement required the same size battery. Now I keep one upstairs and one downstairs. It cost more to ship the second racket back than it was worth. Be careful of the descriptions so you will know what you are getting.
5,fun to use,"This tool is awesome. It works at getting rid of all types of flying insects, especially mosquitos. I hate to sound cruel, but I actually like the loud pop sound it makes when in contact with a mosquito. It just means there will be one less mosquito around to bite my two toddlers. It's a really wonderful tool because it is powerful. It uses to D size batteries and the 1500 volts kill on contact. My husband enjoys it so much, he hunts for the mosquitos every night before we go to bed (during the summer time). We love it so much, we purchased one for my FIL and one for my sister and her fiance. You won't regret buying it!"
3,fly swatter,"not very impressed with said product, I think the risk over does the good. the old fly swater is best, I was wrong to buy these"
2,Not as effective as other similar products.,"I bought this product because I have used a similar one in the past, and found it to work well, this one is designed differently.I bought this type specifically because it said it works for gnats, however In order to zap the bugs it needs to be big enough to touch both the inner and outer metal at the same time, a good safety feature for people with kids, not so great for people with tiny bugs that just pass right through that middle space.for the price it is decently built, not as cheap as some others I have gotten in the past, it works well for regular sized flies, just not itty bitty bugs like it said."
5,Awesome,"this certainly does what it is meant for, just wish the button wasn't on the right side so children can activate it so easy, my nephew picked it up and almost electrocuted himself, because he thought it was a normal tennis racket.but outside of that it works perfect for killing insects, flying termites, roaches, flys, ...."
1,Did not work,"The device did not work, there was no voltage produced to kill insects. I was forced to buy another brand which did work correctly."
1,cheaply made,It broke after one swing at a fly. I knicked the edge of a table and it flew into pieces...The fly got away.
1,You'll do better with a rolled up newspaper.,"You cannot SWAT flies with this thing.My wife ordered them after reading other reviews.The swatters are more like badmitton rackets and are heavy. If you start swinging them around, you'll be breaking stuff left and right.The electric grid is recessed, so even if you try to hit a fly on a flat surface, it won't hit the fly. You may be able to trap it and wait for it to fly up into the grid.The best I could do with it is hold it out and wait for a fly to land on it. I think I got about five flies in 3 days. Could have got dozens with a regular fly swatter.It is fun to see them pop and spark when you do get one but I didn't get it for fun."
1,"Total junk, DOA","I received the one with the D batteries despite wanting the one with the AAs. Sorry to all of you who wanted the opposite. The little red light came on, it made some noise like it was trying to charge up but never worked. No spark for flys, no spark for fingers, NOTHING. DOA."
3,Bug zapper...Well almost,"I originally purchased a ""2 AA Battery"" zapper from a local store. It made a great zapping noise every time we zapped a bug. I figured the ""2 D cell battery"" one would be even louder.... It's not. It will zap the bugs, but most of the time there is no sound. It has a larger outer screen to allow for the larger bugs to touch the inner energized screen.I also thought that it was broken because it takes several seconds of button press to charge the larger capacitor. It works fine, just don't expect a loud pop all of the time."
1,Worst quality!!,"I ordered this online and received it with pretty quick shipping. When I opened it and put the batteries in, it didn't work. I had my husband take a look at it (he unscrewed the handle, it screwed together) to find a circuit board connected to three flimsy wires. One of the wires was smashed between the plastic (maybe why it wasn't working). The plastic they use is like something out of a .25 cent machine. Unless you want a POS product that possibly wont work, and if it does, will only work for a week, tops, order this junk."
3,What was advertised was not what was sent..,"They advertised 'THIS IS NOT your regular WEAK ""AA"" powered Electronic swatter. Our Electronic swatter uses 2 ""D"" batteries which gives off a POWERFUL 1,500 bug exploding volts!What was sent does not use D cells but instead uses 2 'AA' cells in direct contradiction to what they said.I think that the advertisement should clearly state what actually would ship.I have used it and it does work very well so I'll keep it.But in the future I would be reluctant to order from that vendor since I can't be sure that what is advertised would be what they send you."
1,Not what I ordered,"I only purchased from this company because the first fly zapper worked so well. Also the first zapper that I ordered from them matched what was advertised and worked well. So I ordered again, purchasing two zappers. Rather than the pictured and described zapper, I received something different. Pictured was a zapper that took 2 ""D"" cell batteries with a lightening bolt on it and a stout electrical grid. What I received was a different zapper. For starters it takes 2 AA batteries and does not work nearly as well as what was advertised. Also, the first one that I opened only lasted 2 minutes and then the button quit working properly. It stayed on even if not pushed. The only way to turn unit off was to take battery out.I am very disappointed and will not buy from them again."
2,Very shoddy construction!,"I bought 3 of these on Amazon at the same time. 1 is still working. The second worked for a little more than 1 week and then stopped working. The third is DOA right from the package. Also, the picture on Amazon is slightly different from the one that was sent.I'm pretty disappointed - too many flies around now!"
3,Double D Disappointment,"I bought this version for a trip to Alaska and although it seemed to work, it didn't ""fry"" mosquitoes with the satisfying pop like other zappers I had purchased, and it was a bit heavier than the AA models. Also we found them readily available in Alaska for 6.99 to 9.99 at several retail outlets."
1,Use A Badminton Racket Instead,"This zapper works as advertised but is poorly designed, a badminton racket is cheaper and 100 times more effective.The push button on the electric zapper is halfway up the handle, this requires you to hold the button depressed while you swing which cuts down your overall reach, its handle is way heavy and broad which makes it harder to get a fast wrist snap without the racket flying out of your hand. The best non pesticide weapon against fast moving carpenter bees (or wasps) is a badminton racket.I've never had a carpenter bee recover from a badminton shot, you don't need the additional electric charge to kill them, just a nice solid swing with as much wrist snap as you can put into it and that will take care of them."
2,Not the best fly zapper,"This bug zapper did not work as well as other zappers. A ""protective"" layer of wire over the portion that actually zaps the bugs seems to keep some bugs from reaching the zapping mesh. Have used a different brand, the Charcoal Companion, for example, that allows bugs to get zapped without having to get through a protective screen. In addition, this product stopped working without receiving much use. Would not buy it again."
2,"Too Heavy, Slow",This product is kinda clunky and a waste of money for me. My boyfriend has one and likes his though.
1,An absolute waste of time,"I like to be generous with these book reviews, but this book is just a big waste of time. It is all fluff, even though the author tries to redeem it by having a sweet little sidestory of friends helping friends. The book is written in a hip manner that I probably could've read when I was in second grade. I can see how it might appeal to girls, because it has a nice, ""frog-to-Prince-Charming"" type of ending, but I strongly advise against reading it."
3,Fleece Gloves,"These gloves serve their purpose of keeping hands very warm, but the stitching on the velcro started coming out after wearing them once and the stitching in the fingers started coming out after the second wear."
3,Not as pictured,This is the right bulb which is getting harder and harder to find BUT...the surface of the bulb is CLEAR AND SMOOTH not beveled as shown. I wanted to match the bulbs I currently have (downlighting) so I returned these.
2,Wish Someone Else Would Make This,"If a competitor of Delta made a sled like this I would give this one away. Many of the hold-downs have broken with normal use. Every time I use it I would like to throw it in the trash, but, I have not been able to find anything that accomplishes the same task as this. The mitre guage is the same inaccurate part as the one that Delta gives you with any table saw purchased. ...."
3,Good - not great - but good,"The 43-188 is a reasonable tool. I was disappointed at first but then I realized that gobs of clamping force is not required to hold a piece of wood still while shaping. It would be nice if the clamps would hold things down tighter but to accomplish that would require a complete rework of the design and then versatility would suffer.A professional shop would make their own but for the one man shop that makes a wide variety of pieces from day to day, the jig does things well enough.The packing grease gets on the pads so they have to be cleaned before using it the first time. If you fail to do that, the wood will slide around.I have had mine for a couple of years and am still mostly happy with it."
4,"""Safe and Heavy Built Sled""","There's not many of these type of sleds around any more. Shapers are going away, but it's good to see that Delta still has one. Try looking for a vintage shaper sled and see what the prices are going for. This isn't the old vintage Delta (USA made) cast shaper sled, but it works well. A little more plastic than I would like, but at least you can still get one that isn't made of Phenolic or similar light-weight material."
5,"Man o' Man, you need this game...","Ok, lets put it this way, this game blows every other RPG out of the water. It has excellent visuals and sounds, plus a viriety of installation methods. With 100 different weapons and military devices, you can be a walking army. I got this game close to a year and a half ago, and couldn't stop playing for 6 months. The great thing is, once you beat it (and it take forever to, becuase of all the quests and such) you can keep playing! There are so many different characters that there is an unlimited supply of people to talk to, barter with or kill. I had no idea how they had the capacity to make such a great game. Just buy it, you'll see ;)"
5,Fallout Forever,"I love Fallout, exspecially Fallout 2. I bought Fallout 2 because I play Fallout and loved it. If you've played Fallout before Fallout 2 you'll find that Fallout 2 is a lot more discouraging. It's a lot harder to develop a new character. You'll never reach a point where you're immortal (eg. you can kill anything with ease). But anyway Fallout 2 is still great. I let my friend play Fallout 2 and he had a sleepover at my house just so he could play Fallout 2. Everyone I know loves Fallout 2."
5,Great offline RPG!,"This is a really great single person RPG. Can't beat the price either. This was recommended to me by a friend, and even though it is an old game, it really is great."
1,Fallout 2 download didnt work,I love the Fallout series and have played all the games. I got an itch to play Fallout 2 again so I bought and downloaded it from here. It dose not work on my computer and after hours of trying to fix it had to finally give up. It needs Directx 9.0c and The current version of Directx 11 will not run it and I tryed many things to make the game work even running it in Dosbox but to no avail. my suggestion is to buy the game at your own risk.
4,good game,I was thourly pleased with the game but the instalation was hard I had to download it on a different computer the transfer it to this one. but over all it was a good game and worth what I went through
5,What a game!,"This was one of the best games that I have played in a while. It has an engaging story line with more than one ending. It has challenging yet not difficult game play, the ability to be more than one character and great graphics. Its world is infinitely engaging. While this game as I said does have more than one ending it does not have an infinite amount of endings and that is its only downside."
2,Not what I expected.,I cannot play this game because it is nothing like the other fallout games I have played. Very dissappointing.so I gave up on playing it.
4,"Not As Good As Fallout I or Fallout Tactics, Still a Blast","Fallout II, while falling short of the original Fallout, or the squad based Fallout Tactics, is still a fantastic game, definitely worth a look. It plays similar to the first installment, but boasts better graphics and richer character dialogues (The two things going for it.) I recommend purchasing the dual package, which contains both Fallout I & Fallout II. It is worht the price for the first alone, and the second is a nice bonus. Four stars, highly recommended."
4,Good but not great,"Yes, Fallout 2 is one of the best RPG games out there, especially considering the fact that there are no futuristic RPG's in the current market. However, this game requires way to much search and talk. It gets very old very quickly, and you will find yourself with the best equipment on the planet by simply waiting for two different parties to kill each other. I had a flamethrower within one hour of playing that made me nearly invincible. I mean, come on. Unless you are going to play this game without accepting help from NPC's, this really proves no challenge and damages the fun factor. At least the price is right."
4,Post-apocalyptic rpg set in the wastes of California,"This game is pretty cool. There are a lot of really great atmospheric effects (music, sound, etc.) that add to the game. However, it's a pretty hard game to beat, with a lot of combat and not many situations you can talk your way out of."
5,One of the best CRPG ever...,"The original Fallout was the best RPG of 1997, almost by default. Fallout 2 is basically more of the same, which is good. However, it also revived a slew of minor upgrades from enhanced NPC control to extra animations.The most notable and important change in Fallout 2 is better NPC AI and controls. In the original Fallout NPCs were almost useless (except Dogmeat). You control options from chemical usage to weapon selection. In the end, the truth is that Fallout 2 is another outstanding RPG and expands on its predecessor impressively with more places, graphics, sounds and gameplay. If you like RPGs at all, pick up Fallout 2. You won't regret it."
3,Just OK,"The M-Audio Radium61 is an OK starter controller. If you are used to 80's keyboards with no weighted or semi-weighted action, this controller, though a bit ""springy"", will feel fimiliar. The ""springy-ness"" doesn't lend it's self to subtle, delicate playing - at all. I bought the Raduim61 at the same time I bought Propellerheads Reason, and cost was a slight factor in that decision. I was looking at this and the more expensive Navation ReMOTE 61 (semi-weighted, 64 user & 50 factory presets [many of which are specificaly for Reason] - not 16 like this model) In Reason I was using the Rhodes, Hammond and Wurlitzer models. The Radium61 just wasn't cutting it. After a month I went back and bought the Navation. For synth pop and pads this would be a good unit, but for just about anything else, get a weighted or semi-weighted controller like the M-Audio Keystation 61 (cheaper than the Radium61 and without the knobs and sliders) or the Navation ReMOTE 61 (which I highly recommend)."
3,XP users beware,"Solidly built keyboard at a good price, ($150 new) but I was unable to get Windows XP to recognize it, even after much effort, and so took it back to store for refund.I did get it working on my Mac, but there, only after installation of rather quirky driver software.I agree that the keys are ""springy"" and it might be hard to play this keyboard with much delicacy.Got hardly any response from M-Audo when I e-mailed them for help."
1,^^^^^ lousy apologist of attrocities,india could have developed all the things you mentioned without the english.you say we look at the poms with neither shame nor regret - well here's how we look at it -http://www.atributetohinduism.com/European_Imperialism.htm#Rape%20of%20India%20by%20the%20British
2,6000 years and 6000 names,"This book covers the thousands of rulers that have governed India and the thousands of battles its fought over 6000 years. And that's about it. There are a handful of pages covering Gandhi and then onwards until 1971, when the book really ends. It is a tedious read. Although the book has a publication date of 2003, the only addition since 1971 is a three page note by the editor providing a couple of updates."
4,Attempts the impossible. . .,". . . and comes out shining. This is a fine introduction for the mathematically uninitiated. The fact of the matter is that these are the HARDEST seven problems out there--problems so hard that a graduate-level education in mathematics is typically needed to even begin attempting to solve these problems. As someone who's been in college sinfully long, and had some college calculus, I can say that the math required to understand these problems is way beyond that of the average college graduate. That said, Devlin's genius is that he boils the math down into basic functions that are more or less easily understood. He also places the problems in their proper historical context (discusses their etiology) and he also looks at some of the ways that the problems have been approached in the past. I didn't expect to like this book; I was pleasantly suprised."
1,A waste of time from any point of view...,...where are the editors when you need them?...maybe this could have been a good 50 page book describing some difficult mathematical problems...as it stands it rambles on for two hundred plus pages with information that is shallow if you know a lot about math and incomprehensible if you don't...get it from the library.
3,"Good introduction, but very superficial","This is an honest attempt to introduce a wide range of mathematical problems to a general readership; problem is: only readers with some background in mathematics are likely to be drawn to a book like this, and for them this book is simply too superficial. I read about half of it, selecting the problems I was interested in: I learned nothing I didn't already know -- and I don't know much at all.In my opinion the pitch of the book is wrong: readers with a background in mathematics will find it shallow and useless; readers with no background are more likely to want to read a Newyorker- or Newsweek-type article, rather than a whole book. So I think the book is honest and well intended, but flawed from the start."
3,Pedantic,"This book is more pedantic than I thought it would be. Being a smallish book and a smaller audience, it is understandable that the mathematical details are trimmed down (almost excised, you might say). Still, there is too much history and not enough details. Too often the author says that it may be above the reader's level. Overall, I was disappointed, but it was not a waste."
5,Spiritual Friendship,"Author Kevin Huggins understands people because he knows God and His Word. Following Christ's model, Huggins takes readers on a journey through the complexities of being a true spiritual friend. If you're struggling for a way of thinking about friendship that will change how you interact with your closest friends, then ""Friendship Counseling"" is the book for you.Reviewer: Dr. Bob Kellemen, author of ""Soul Physicians: A Theology of Soul Care and Spiritual Direction"" and ""Spiritual Friends: A Methodology of Soul Care and Spiritual Direction,"" and ""Beyond the Suffering: Embracing the Legacy of African American Soul Care and Spiritual Direction."""
5,RIP HITMAN,pick this up this is dope as hecks! macka a hoe crack a hoe!!!! LOL..hitman is dope! pick up h20 too!
4,SCARY!,"I actually saw this on TV a few days ago, and it scared the ... out of me! I have never seen anything like this before! I was always unsure of the existence of ""paranormal"" activity, THIS CONVINCED ME! Watch it... it will freak you out."
4,An Unknown Encounter,"This is a great documentary of a haunting. I am rather disappointed in the way they investigated the matter. They could have investigated the ghost, why it was haunting the person and how could they put him to rest.They have great footage of orbs, and poltergeist-like happenings. I am definitely ordering this video."
2,Flimsy,"I was surprised at Polder making a flimsy cookie slide when it should be firm. I guess it will still work okay, but at this price I'm disappointed."
5,travel size tubes,Please make travel size tubes. Airlines refuse to left full size tubes on planes I only use CLOSE UP PLEASE MAKE SMALL ONES THANKS
2,Not too much too it.,"Computer pinball games have usually been no replacement for the real thing. Going back to the days of Atari Video Pinball, which was fun, the video pinball games haven't evolved much since then.Star Trek Pinball is no exception. It is fun, but the shelf life isn't very long. You will install it, play it a few times and then forget it.The graphics are good but there isn't much that Star Trek can add to video pinball.Overall, as a Trek collector, I would pick this up, but don't expect to play it often."
2,This really is pretty bad.,"We have had two of these toys, both gifts, both nearly impossible to erase. It takes quite a lot of strength to pull that ladybug down. Then, after a few months either the ladybug starts to come off of the lever or the lever no longer goes all the way to the bottom, making it impossible to erase part of the screen. And the whole ladybug eraser mechanism is really loud and annoying. The animals aren't magnetized to the top, they kind of snap in and out. So, as others have said, they go from being hard to get out to falling out too easily. We also have the Fisher Price Doodle Pro. The shapes on that slide into the side, keeping them from getting lost. It's really easy to erase, and the screen looks better--whiter and the black shows up better."
2,Keep Shopping,"I wasn't impressed with this product and feel there are definately better ones out there. The marks don't show up that well--they are dull, our ladybug eraser was extremely difficult for our little one to pull and eventually got stuck and broke altogether. It has some nice features, like the animal shapes, the cushion bottom and carry handle, but all in all ... not worth buying."
1,Can't erase,"The eraser mechanism too hard to pull down - even for the mom !!! Great idea, but go elsewhere for something easier to use."
4,"Not bad, but could be better","Our daughter loves this thing but when we got it, it was very hard to erase it. The lever to erase the images is on a gear that makes it hard to operate even for an adult. I simply took it apart and removed the gear which allows it to erase much easier. There is still resistance from it sliding behind the plastic that you draw on so it does not flop around easily and erase when it shouldn't. I would recommend that the manufacturer make a change so that the erasing function works easier for kids to operate. Other than that, it is a great doodle pad for little ones with a padded back for comfort and ease of use."
1,"Child loved it, but hard to use","My son got this at 18 months and is now 26 months old - he cannot remove the stamping on his own and the ladybug eraser is too hard for him to pull down. It also is losing its magnetism. He loves playing with it, so we have replaced with a very inexpensive version which he can play with independently (use the stampers and erase) and we are all much happier now. The concept on this is good - but they need serious improvements to the product."
1,impossible for the age range,"This toy makes it basically impossible for a small child to erase. We bought this for our 18m old daughter, and her 3yr old cousins could barley pull it down and it took them a long time to do it. This is also VERY senssitive to pressure; it doesn't take long before general use has permanently laft marks on the board. Go get the little Sesame street magnadoodle one, easy erase board and can turn on/off sounds."
1,Not kid-friendly,I totally agree with the other reviews. We received this as a gift. My 18 month old loves drawing on it - but he cannot clear the screen or get the stampers out. My 4 year old can barely clear the screen! Our Magnadoodle and Doodle Pro work great. I was shocked that something that was so difficult for a child to use was marketed by Parents Magazine!!
1,artsymom,"My daughter loves to play with her friend's Fisher Price magna doodle so I thought this one was more appropriate for her age (18 months) and was a good ""starter"" one. We received it as a gift and it was immediately rejected by her. The lever to pull to erase your drawings can't be pulled by her and I have to use a lot of effort to pull myself. Once you pull the lever to the bottom it automatically creeps back up itself; so it makes a mechanical noise which scares her. Then the cute animals at the top which makes shapes can't be easily gotten out and once they are out she can't ""snap"" them back in so if she carries her drawing somewhere all the little animals fall out. And last, the connecting string to the pen just reaches the edges. If your child can actually draw with the pen up straight then you will have no problem:) Even though this one was recommended for a younger age than some of the Fisher Price ones, it isn't worth it. The intention is great, but fails to work for an 18 month old."
1,Lady bug is even hard for me!!!,"Just purchased this for my 2.5 year old for Christmas. She loves playing with it, but we have to erase the board for her everytime because no child would be strong enough to pull down the lady bug themselves. You would think that the manufacturer would have known this. Why make a product for such a young age group if they are not yet strong enough to use it?!?!?!?"
1,Very Disapointing,"I bought this for my 18-month-old niece for Christmas as it *looked* sturdier and more toddler-friendly than other magnetic doodle boards, and I trusted the Parent's Magazine brand name - that'll teach me not to deviate again from my usual practice of checking the customer reviews here first. As others have reported, the ladybug ""eraser"" is difficult for even an adult to pull, and makes a terrible grinding noise when released. I'd try the advice given below about removing a gear to fix this flaw, but since the board has already lost most of its magnetic function after less than a month there's really not much point. I'm disappointed that Parent's Magazine would give their name to such an inferior product, but after other recent bad experiences with the ""second generation"" of their toy cell phones (with the multicolored print exterior as opposed to the original solid red or black versions) I suppose I shouldn't be too surprised."
2,"Kid's loved it, while it lasted.","The kids really liked this from the start. They got it at their first birthday (twins.) But they could not use it independently and still can't at 2. They can't get the ladybug to erase. It is hard even for me. They can't always get the puzzle pieces out. But the deal breaker was that it lost its ability to stay magnatized after just a couple of months of use. The lines just fade away in seconds. I guess it is good, though. Then they don't have to bring it to me to erase! They used it for a while dispite, but now the lines they draw don't even show up at all. I think I might get them a regular magnadoodle this year because they liked it so much at the start. But it really only lasted (with my constant assistance) for about 2 months."
1,Screen broke after a week,The screen's quality is awful and stopped working correctly after a week... the lines pretty much self-erase right away.
2,Poor quality,"I, too, bought the product because of the Parents brand. I was standing in the store looking at two of them and chose this one over the other because of the brand. However, I am very disappointed with it, primarily because of how light (vs. dark) the writing/drawing appears on the screen. Not only is the color very light, it also erases very easily (even without using the ladybug eraser). Though these flaws don't seem to bother my almost 2 year old son, I would not recommend this to others."
4,Great toy,"My 3 year old daughter and I both love this toy. Yes the eraser was a little tough for her at first, but she is able to do it fine. We've had it 7 months now and have not lost any of the stamps, you just have to keep track of them. I gave it 4 instead of 5 because the lady bug eraser does make an annoying sound as it goes up."
2,Not impressed,"We got two of these as a gift for our children (aged 1 and 2) for Christmas. We haven't had the issues with the lady bug, both kids are able to erase on their own. That is, if it needs erasing. Only 3 days after getting them...the lines fade within seconds. This is fine for my 1 year old who continues to scribble, but my 2 year old is frustrated that he can't even finish a picture before the lines are gone.We would not recommend this to anyone and would return them if we could.~S"
2,The Lady Bug!,"This started out great but then the lady bug gets stuck and the kids are unable to use it by themselves anymore, in fact, I couldn't pull the eraser down either. I was shocked when I found this at Amazing Savings for only 7.99 but now I know why"
4,Great Toy For A Toddler!,"My 20 month old daughter just received this as an early Christmas present and she LOVES it! We have no problems with the ladybug. She can move it all by herself and it erases both ways. Reading the reviews, I wonder if they fixed the problem in a newer model? In any case, I'd definitely recommend this toy. It's kept her quiet and busy for 20 minutes straight now!"
5,Best Toy Ever,"This toy is the best toy you can purchase for your small child. They have hours of fun with it. It is fun to take in the car while traveling or to use in the house to teach them how to draw. My grandson has always loved this toy and and has played with it everyday since I purchased it for him. I wish I could find another one. They are not in stock now but after playing with it for over two years I would like another one to keep on hand at my house. I hope they become available soon because I would also like to buy two more for my new granddaughters. There is no mess to clean up and the stamps on the top are great to help draw into the pictures. Don't hesitate on this, for parents on the go or for the stay at home parent you can't beat this toy for the fun at such a low price."
1,Magnet is very weak,"My 18 month old enjoys the toy now, but from the start, the magnet is very, very weak. Almost as soon as he draws, the lines disappear. The animal magnets are a little stronger. I also found the ladybug difficult for him, but that doesn't bother me as much as the poor quality of the magnet."
1,A monumental piece of junk.,"Immediately after writing on the surface, the magnetic particles started to fade away. What kind of fun is that? Toy was purchased new. Returned and exchanged for a cheaper, larger version made by Crayola."
3,Mediums and madness,"Kate Jasper is afraid to walk into a room full of people, and rightfully so. You see, in the past, whenever she entered such a room, one of the occupants was murdered. Her friend Barbara Chu hopes to help her by taking her to a meeting of psychics. Surely none of them would be so lacking in foresight as to avoid a murderer. Wrong, the most obnoxious of the group, the famous author Silk Sokolov is murdered with a cat toy. Kate of course, feels responsible and obligated to find the murderer with very little help from her sick sweetie Wayne, and the bizarre members of the Paloma PD.This is an entertaining quick read and a good addition to the series."
1,Disappointing Art,"The story was ok but the art work was HORRIBLE. If I had to buy it again I wouldn't it was hard to read the story itself due to the horrible ""art""work"
2,Much needed accessories but......,"I feel that it is just way too much money for what you get. I own a lot of professional (Canon) equipment and gladly paid the price because they are the best things out there. But it makes little sense to market a marginal product and still expect to command a high price.I have the S80. No complaint there. The leather case was just way too tight, which invites a fumble as you try to pull out the camera. The flap issue is an issue. The neck chain is a bit short, and similar and better items can be had for a lower price. If you shop around you can also find the Li battery for less.I'm not upset, but just disappointed with what I got for the price."
4,Useful package though a bit overpriced,"I'm glad I purchased this accessory kit for my new Canon S80--the extra long lanyard allows one to carry the camera in an easily accessible way while hiking. And having a second battery is invaluable. The case is leather and fits snuggly--it is useful for protecting the camera when it is carried in a purse or backpack, but I am finding I set it aside when I'm on the move taking pix."
3,Brutally Hard,"When I played Baldur's Gate, it was a wonderfully long experience of exploration and balanced encounters. If you ran into an over-powering encounter, you knew your party had ventured into the wrong place at the wrong time. This expansion is a bucket of cold water in the face. It's short, just four areas with a dozen or so levels, and brutally hard. Maybe I didn't level-up correctly in Baldur's Gate, but I found every step a struggle of high-level encounters, traps my their couldn't disarm and, worst of all, key puzzles. Additionally the expansion didn't have of the story elements of the original game. The game itself had almost no changes although there was a new auto-pause feature that was very helpful. Hard-core Baldur's Gate fan with a high-level party (10+) will love Sword Coast but other should probably skip it."
2,"Details, Details","The 3d animation and video clips were all fine and good, but the storyline could be quite annoying at times, sometimes it's really hard to do things that don't have much consequence in the plot...poor programming really....let's hope that Baldor's Gate 2 is'nt like this, as far as I'm concerned it had better be a vast improvment."
4,BG Expansion pack is fun & playable,"This expansion pack to Baldur's Gate adds a few areas and moves the EXP cap from 89000 to 161000. It also adds a LOT of new magical EQ into the game. So your characters can get a lot more powerful. I found it fun, and fairly challenging. The new areas are fairly quest and puzzle oriented, a bit more than the core of Baldur's Gate. But don't try to take durlag's tower without a high level thief."
2,Same old...,"This game provided little improvement to Baldur's Gate, chiefly by not advancing the plot at all. Hard-core gamers will buy it, but I advise the casual gamer to stay away."
3,"good, but not necessary","It added a little to the main game, but nothing earth shattering and the quests don't have much to do with the main plot. The quests are VERY difficult to get through and take more than a little patience and perserverence to succeed. My advice? Seek out and downloadthe unofficial add on ""Dark Side of the Sword Coast"" to suplement Baldur's Gate and this Expansion Pack instead."
2,"Long shipment time, not the quality I expected","I ordered this rug for my husband as part of a ""man-cave"" remodel. He is a huge Bills fan, and thought this would fit right in with the theme. I ordered the rug August 3-I didn't receive any tracking information for almost 2+ weeks, then the item didn't arrive for about another week beyond that time. ""Standard shipping"" is listed as 2 weeks at best....I was already irritated by this but thought as long as the item was what I expected, I'd overlook it.The day the rug finally arrived, my husband and I opened it only to find the rug had a horrific odor, and dark brown stained spots all over it as if something was spilled on it. The packaging was intact from Fedex, so I can only assume that the stains were there PRIOR to shipment. Not a very good impression for the company.I will be returning this rug and cancelling my order, although I suspect I'll have to pay to have it shipped back. I hope others have better luck!"
1,junk,"The item arrived broken. It is not air tight to keep bread fresh. It is flimsy. The cutting board sticks. AND, I can't get anyone to contact me so I can get a refund."
2,Nice Product but TERRIBLE Customer Service,I ordered this product in January 2007 and received it in July 2007! They kept pushing back the shipping date..... I would never order from this company again.
2,Polder bread bin,I was hoping to keep my bread longer and fresher but that did not happen so I sent it back.
3,Item is okay...,"I bought this to use as a wall hanging. It looks ""fine"", but the picture really wowed me. I realize that this is hand-dyed, but was hoping that the item would look a bit more like the picture, which shows some black in the background and a lot of brown. Mine is mostly purple (no black) with some splashes of beige, blue, and brown. The vertical lines are barely defined. Not what I was wanting. I think I'll take it down and use it as a sarong!"
1,not another duke wanna be,"this game was a disappointment, kinda like duke 3d but not quite. Really dont that great, I brought it back."
1,Crude and Rude,"crude, and lowclass not entertainment, the language is horrable, I must say I like games with some violence and cursing, but this one goes over the edge a little. I did not find it entertaining."
1,this game Stinks pee you bad,"This game stinks, thats all I have to say, trust me, I think better third person shooting games are out there, like Half-Life, now that game rules..."
3,cheap low tech fun game,"this is an older game so it is cheap. It is fun, though silly. Good for about 40 hours then you've conquered it and it will get old. This is not diablo III man, it is Redneck Rampage. Have fun, drink a beer, and turn the brain off and enjoy."
3,Rednecks Rule!,"Your a Redneck, your town is being takin ov'r by space critters. So, you grab your trusty shotgun, some beer and pies (the really good kind!). You drink, piss, and kill things! That is the name of the game in this 1st person shooter. That is it, after all you are a Redneck!"
1,It wouldnt work,"the dang game just wouldnt work on my pc, and when i went to my freinds house who had an old pc that would run it, it didnt have any sound. Oh well."
3,Terri Blake Addison series was better,"I thought the male main character was a little weak. His thinking was clouded by the fact that he was attracted to the woman he was supposed to help. His co-worker, an older woman, was much wiser and was able to see things that he wasn't. She is the real brains in their partnership. I am hoping that in future stories the man won't appear to be so stupid. The Terri Blake Addison series which she wrote under another publisher is much better in my humble opinion"
2,Too Many Typos,"I enjoyed the plot of this book as I have all of Linda Hall's work. However, this kindle edition has WAY too many typos. I cannot believe all of the typing errors! This should not be the case when kindle users pay $9.99 to purchase a piece of good fiction. I would assume the fault for this lies with the publisher. It seemed like there was an error on every few pages. Lots of the errors had to do with formatting apostrophes but there were occasionally typed ""words"" that I could not even make out within the sentence and paragraph content. Though I am enjoying the plot, the abundance of typos makes me want to ask for a refund."
5,there's lots that i can do,"This is a warm, sweet children's book, perfect for 2 to 4 year olds. The drawings are lively and colorful. The book gets right into the world of a little person. It points out all that a young child is capable of--yet does so in a playful way, showing that sometimes there are a few spills along the way."
4,Useful theories and methods,"If you are an Australian punter looking to use sectional times, speed figures and pace calculations then this is a must have book but beware! Australian form guides do not contain the information needed to reporduce many of these calculations and to embark on a carbon copy application of this method would require literally a hundred hours per week of labour.Sectional split times are available in Australia but 1) they are not accurate and 2) they need to be converted into different distance segments to fit with the methods in this book.But what about the book itself? Brilliant. Tom's explanation of all things speed and pace is a clear, concise and perfect example of a ""how to"" publication.I enjoyed it purely from a punting purist perspective and took away many clever angles for which to apply to my selection processes.Top notch."
4,Review Tom Brohamer's Book titled Modern Pace Handicapping,"As an Owner of the book, I think it is very well written and is very empirical. My review is mostly a request to have the book's author to advise me of what computer program(s) are available and what programmable calculators are available that will compound the ratings and generate the energy percentages either at home on the computer or the race track or simulcast outlet."
3,of some value,this book has some intelligent approaches to handicappingi don't agree that modeling of recent races is of much help as i have not found it so in p racticethe idea that each horse has a particular running style is a valid one and can help in handicapping a race.i think that pace handicapping is widely used in the betting and is no longer of much value if it ever was.
2,Interesting but too complex,The concept of turn time is very interesting and very ingenious but implementing the Brohamer method is too complex and time consuming. I'm sticking to the Taulbot and Ainslie's methods of pace evaluation.
2,Reality Check,"Let's be serious. The idea of a good computer game from TSR is enough to make any D&D fan take notice, and they came SO close. But they failed in the most important part of it all. D&D is all about interacting with other players, and the multiplayer aspect of the game is simply terrible. It's impossible to do anything if you are not the main character, (the idea that there would even be a main character in a D&D game is insulting to all the players of the real game,) because whatever he does screws up whatever you are trying to do, even if you're not even on the same screen. It's not fun to follow someone else around the screen. Single player play is fair, but again, its all about playing with other people. Buyers beware."
1,very angry,"i was totally into the game and finally entering baldur's gate for the first time when i found out that the 5th cd was scrached and every time i entered the city or tried anything on the 5th cd the game would freeze and now i am not able to finish the game. i agree with anybody who says the black isle took little concern in making the cd's work, the first cd had something, i didn't know what it was, the customer service didn't know what it was, and i had to spend almost 15 mintues rubbing my cd with rubbing alcohol to get this...crap ofmy cd and make it run. although the game is great i would not remomend taking the gamble with your money and hope that you get a game with 5 usable cd's, good luck though"
4,"A great game, I play it over an over again :)","When I first picked it up, I thought it would end up just being another throw away.I WAS WRONG ! fun game, your actions change the story an how others will interact with you. Download a few ""add on "" utilities for this an you will become a GOD.....lolI would have given this a 5 but they need to change up that ending a bit......kinda goes to fast. :("
3,"Terrible packaging, disk often unusable. Only buy in store!","While the game is a great deal of fun. The reason I rated it only 3 stars is that the packaging is so terrible, the disks are often damaged. It is packaged in a poorly designed cardboard contraption with lots of rubber cement. It falls apart in storage and shipping, so you end up getting disks covered in goo that is impossible to remove. I had to ship mine back. I went out and got it at a local store, made them open the package and check for goo damage. Sure enough, they had to open 4 (!) before they finally found one that was intact and clean. Great game, poor package design. Buy it, but buy it in a store so you can be sure you get a set of clean disks. Save yourself the dissapointment. It seems to be only this, the first Baldur's Gate that has the trouble. We have all the others and they are wonderful in every way."
4,"Good Game, not for Impatient players","I found this game to be very entertaining, though I found it frustrating and dull at times, but is enjoyable. It is a good role-playing game, but the ending was not what I expected at all. I liked the little quests and enjoyed the multiple choices you could make, I like the fact that there are many spells and weapons. This is a great game entertaining but slow, not for impatience players. Usually many of the important characters die so if you don't want to pay money to revive them, you should save all the time. It is recomendable for people who enjoy a long sharp game. Yet again I repeat not for eager players. This game is long and you won't win the first time you play. But it is a witty game."
4,Baldur's Gate,"A lot of fun for RPG players. The graphics are a little dated, but that doesn't really detract from the total story of the game. In fact, story is the key point of the game and it has a lot of it, enough to keep any player busy for hours. Overall its a lot of fun, especially on older computers which can run more modern games, but with games like Baldur's Gate who needs modern games anyway..."
5,Favorite Computer Game,"I would have to say this is my favorite computer game of all time. What's better than being able to create your own character, choose stats, choose party members, and uncover various maps any way you like. Also you can export your character and upload him/her to the sequal Baldur's Gate:Shadows of Amn and carry on your character where you left off. This game is a sure buy!"
2,Good (for the first 30 mins),Okay so a couple year ago I bought this game hearing all the rave about it I thought I would be in for loads of fun. I was wrong I only got to the mines (one of the first levels) and kept dying. This game has a good story and characters but it takes forever to grow a level (get stronger) and the levels are close to impossible. If you want a real RPG get Diablo 2 it has great multiplayer and loads of fun. Or for those of you that cant play M rated games you should get Final Fantasy 7. Peace out and I hope that I just saved you the grief of buying this extremely boring game.
3,"kill, get item, give item, reward, kill, get item, give ...","At first I liked this game. Especially because of the books I found and my encounters with interesting characters. But after a while it got more and more centered on combat. Even though the combat system is great, I got bored with it after chapter 6 or 7. after a while I got really sick of the 'find the bad guy, kill the bad guy, get some stuff from his corpse, give it to the good guy, get something for yourself' style quests. The game is simply TOO REPETITIVE. After chapter 6 or 7 I uninstalled it even though I suspected I was close to the end of the game.Alltogether, I had good fun playing this game the first week, but after that it got annoying. For a good story I would recommend PlaneScape: Torment."
4,mmmm....,"It's nice, but you have to earn ALOT of experience to go up just one level and the monster don't give you much. You don't get alot of money. You get alot of party memebers really fast, they're helpful but die really fast. It's okay."
3,Complicating,"This game is too overwhelming. During each battle you have to instruct your six men, which gets annoying. Buy Diablo I and II instead"
3,"Many hours, dragged out parts (at least for beginner)","I play Diablo 2 a lot, and someone recommended this game. There are some similarities, but many differences. The one thing I don't like about this game is you have to continually go back (with the cursor) and forth to move the characters about. The battles must be done (at least for me to have a chance) with constant pausing and rearranging your characters so they don't get killed. I have probably put 25 hours in on the game, and I am still in Chapter 2. Maybe I just need more experience at the game, but so far it is frustrating. You kind of have to fly by the seat of your pants."
5,Baldur's Gate Rave Review,I really liked this game. It hurls you into a fantasy world with stunning graphics and smooth DirectX animation. It's perfect for any hardcore AD&D gamer and all my friends like it. Five stars out of five!
5,Extremly Great game,"Baldurs Gate is the best game I've ever played. It gives you the freedom in a RPG you've always looked for. You can go anywhere and do anything.Gain up to five players on your team, all with their own special abilities.You can get tons of accessories-Helmets,ammors,swords,mace,bows,clubs,slings,rings,amulet,boots,and lots more.This RPG is different from the restwhen you get level ups the enemies just dont get weaker or stronger but smarter. The enemies include:orges,gnolls,skeletens,giant spiders,wizards,other humans,badits,wolves,hobgoblins,and plenty more.In some RPG they say you get to custimize your characters. In this game you can choose:human,elf,half elf,hafling,dwarf,gnome,then choose from a paladin,ranger,warrior,fighter,mage,druid,bard,then choose your skills,then your weapons(you can buy different ones though.This game takes a lot of time to beat. It is truly a Great Game"
4,Interesting story,"Baldurs Gate, is probably one of the better role playing games on the market today. It has some good characters, along with a riviting story line that will keep you hooked as you play it. The music is great, and the graphics are very good for a computer game. There is a wide list of characters and NPC's that will help your character on their quest. And the best part of this game, is that the controls are actually easy to use, so you arent stressing yourself out to looking for the right buttons to use in your battles. I rate this game at 4 stars because it could be a little longer, and a little better, but for 19.99 it is definately a game worth buying."
5,Baldur's Gate,"This game is worth the money! Even with the fix in level advancement, the game is still more than excellent. The ability to import character portraits and personalized sounds makes it even better. There could have been more interaction with the NPC's, but everything else is solid! Wonderful game!!!"
5,I have seen the light,"For so long I put everything into my work and nothing into me. A few years ago I made the decision to focus on ME and not everyone else. In doing so I discovered a few things about myself that I had pushed to the back of the inner recesses of my mind....mainly that I'm attracted to women. No wonder I never had any chemistry with men. I was looking for the right thing with the wrong gender. But with little support, there was nothing I could do with these feelings...I was uncomfortable with myself. But then I discovered the website and this book....it covers every topic I had questions about and then some. The amount of useful information is astounding. Why on earth did I not discover this book sooner? It would have saved me a couple of extra ""floating"" years....time that would have been better spent working on being true to myself and who I am - exactly what this book was intended to do, I'm sure. I recommend it wholeheartedly."
4,"Teresa,coming out at 41,in Ohio","How to Be a Happy Lesbian:A Coming Out Guide descibes the beginning of a ... relationshipand how it's important to take the time to please your partner.I thought this was wonderful.I especially enjoyed the personal aspects of the authors telling about what happened to them.It made the reading more enjoyable--knowing they had ""been there,done that"" and this wasn't a ""put tab A in slot B"" kind of a book.Thanks again for writing this book.I learned alot and tried a few things I read in the ""Romance and the art of making lesbian love chapter."" They worked pretty good."
1,Captain Obvious,"I was looking forward to reading this book because I don't have any lesbian friends and coming out as bisexual has been very difficult. The book disappointed me right away giving dated, obvious, and uncaring information. If you need to know that rainbows are gay symbols then you might find the book useful, but I read the whole thing waiting for some deeper information that never came. I was even insulted when the author said if you try to find others online then you could be ""so socially backward that they (you) cannot make friends in a normal way."" The resource links at the back are so old now that they don't even work. The whole book was superficial and hasn't given me any tools for future happiness. I don't even know where to start to become a happy bisexual with friends in the GLBTQ community. I guess I'll have to figure it out alone. I would suggest ""Free Your Mind"" as a youth coming out book. It's dated too, but at least that book is uplifting."
3,batteries,"They are batteries , they fit, and so far seem to last for a while . I did not give 5 stars because they came wrapped in a piece of paper with scotch tape. Not what was pictured or expected . Not professional at all. I don't know how old they are or if they have been used or what. I would expect when I pay that much for batteries that they should at least come in a package ."
5,Just what they're supposed to be,There's not much to say on these other than they are exactly what they're supposed to be. They're a great price and have been working well for my streamlight helmet light.
1,Did not last long at all!!!,I bought these batteries for my surefire flashlight which I used for approximately 2 hours before the flashlight dimmed out and the batteries died. The original batteries that came with the flashlight lasted for months before I replaced them. These may have been old batteries that sat on the shelf for awhile. I already threw away the package for them so I probably cannot return them so I decided to write this review. I do not ever write reviews but I was very disappointed by these batteries.
5,Was just what I needed but unable to find locally,"My husband needed these for a particular flashlight but couldn't find the batteries in a store nearby, so as usual I went to the web."
3,"Funny at times, but also pretty whiny","In this ""diary"" (what diary has a co-author?) of his season with the Yankees in 1978, Lyle reveals the tension and lunacy of that memorable year. Only problem is, Lyle's frequent whining about being put on the back burner for the younger, stronger, and better Goose Gossage gets tiresome after awhile. It almost made me want to put down the book. While his inside info is nice, he puts himself ahead of the team at times by leaving before a game ends. At times you felt bad for Sparky for being shunned, other times you want to slap him for being so selfish. At any rate, I'd recommend getting Roger Kahn's ""October Men"" as a reference for the 1978 Yankees before this one."
3,Funny Book,"This book was a funny book. However, I have to admit I was a bit disppointed as I felt it was a little too overrated. I would have liked to have learned a little bit more about the inside story of the yankees during those times instead of just the silliness.Nevertheless, this book is an easy read that I feel all Yankee fans will enjoy."
3,some funny stuff,"A few good and humorous stories. The rest is just a boring day to day journal of exactly what happened in ballgames. ""Johnson swung on a 3-2 pitch with a half chop and that's how we retired the side."" kind of stuff."
5,A season of intrigues,"Even if I read this book over 30 years ago, I still remember I had a great time reading it. Lyle's account of the 1978 Yankee season is funny and enlightening. Written in dairies form, you'll experience the day to day drama and intrigues going on in the Bombers clubhouse.What I found really, but really interesting is what Lyle himself experienced after winning the Cy Young award in 1977. To show his gratitude, Steinbrenner inked Goose Gossage for more money right after Lyle won the award! In fact, Sparky lost the closer job to Gossage after winning the biggest prize a pitcher can win. Game after game, he had to watch Gossage do his job, while himself being put more or less into the long-man role!All in all, Lyle draws an honest picture of the '78 Yankees, and in my mind, The Bronx Zoo is has good has any other players book such as Perfect I'm not or Ball Four."
5,A Great Account!,"It's nice to finally read a book written on the level of a true baseball fan. Honestly, until I got the book, I had no idea that it was written by Sparky Lyle. But that made it even better --- knowing that it was all coming from a firsthand source. The descriptions of the antics make you laugh. The seriousness about the business of the game makes you think. But the memories make it all come together. Hearing about all the things we remember about the players, and hearing about the things we never heard about the players makes the book an interesting read. It was a unique time for the Yankees, with a bunch of characters that make the book title work!"
3,somewhat dissapointed,"Great inside info on a great season. I was surprised however at Sparky's constant complaints throughout the book. He keeps talking about all he wants to do is pitch, but spends the first half of the book complaining he is underpaid. Also talks about how he just wants the team to win, but at various points, refuses to go into games or leaves the team completely for a game. This is a good read and I would recommend it, but Sparky really moved down a notch or two in my eyes."
4,Baseball Fan,"Take an outside look back at the early era of what would be the beginning of one of the most influential owners today George Steinbrenner and the 1978 New York Yankees. Growing up as an adamant baseball fan I admired some of the games greats such as Thurman Munson, Ron Guidry, Reggie Jackson, Greg Nettles and the crazy antics of Manager Billy Martin. Sparky Lyle, a CY Young winning Yankee Pitcher, captures an in dept blue collared look at these majestic names and times in baseball. He also shows us the resentment of a CY Young pitcher that doesn't like the path his championship team is turning. He focuses on the realities of being a popular Yankee and the friends and enemies he's made along his journey. Sparky enlightens the fans as to a new direction baseball is heading and into the beginning of the dollar age. Sparky takes us behind the scenes and in the locker room of what would become the World Series Champions and the controversies along the way."
5,The late 1970s Yankees' ups and downs as told by an insider,"If you remember the thrill of the 1977 and 1978 Worlds Series, when 3 homer Reggie was crowned Mr October, then you want to read Sparky's ""journal"" of his experiences. Billy Martin's tirades, Steinbrenner's lunatic decisions, Bucky, Thurman, Louisiana Lightnin', Mickey Rivers...everybody is here. And ofcourse Reggie, ""the straw that stirred the drink."" This is not your standard pulp baseball autobiography that seems to have been turned out in 3 days by some hack. This is the genuine article, probably the first baseball book since Jim Bouton's ""Ball Four"" to be worth the read. Yankee lovers and baseball history-philes will want this on their shelves."
2,Second Read of Bronx Zoo,"I read this book years ago, after reading Jim Bouton's Ball Four, but did not have a good recollection of the book. Now I know why. Although there are some entertaining parts in general the book is only average as a written work and the content, as one reviewer noted, is first person whiny. Sparky Lyle should have stuck to pitching and focused more on being a competitor. The book is filled with contradictions as he relates hsi values as an athelete. Save your money."
3,"Purchase of ""The Bronx Zoo"" from Amazon","I purchased this book from Amazon and paid full price for a hard copy, but did not receive a paper book jacket for it. I would have liked this to be included in order to protect the book."
1,Learn to Knit,"This item is very disappointing. First of all the project sweater is for children, sizes 4-6. The instructions simply state if you want to make the sweater for an adult use larger needles. I did not find anything about the knitting lesson helpful. This product is useless and I would not recommend that anyone purchase it. The DVD that I received was sticky and has a label on it that reads ""Carroll County Public Library."" Needless to say I am returning this product asap."
1,This album totally sucks,"Wow, what a terrible mistake I made buying this. I love the Offspring, but just about every band on this album simply sucked. They either made the songs really slow and lame, or overly hardcore and...lame. I am pretty open to most types of music, but this made my ears bleed..."
4,more fun than a tractor pull,"This album took me back to a memoriable night in 1983. Grave Digger became the undisputed Monster truck by defeating Bigfoot II at the Louisville Memorial Area. Before that Eddie Rabbit opened the show with a mediocre rendition of ""I Love a Rainy Night."" That's how this album made me feel: confused, discomposed, and slightly buzzed off of Miller Genuine Draft.This is a must buy."
1,false phophets,"It obviously says something about the muse, if these are the artists paying tribute. ""Pretty fly"" indeed...."
