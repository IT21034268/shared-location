4,Nice Wok,"Well made, cooks excellently; wooden handles would be nicer than metal as they remain cool.. The low price is great."
1,Do Not Buy!,"this pan is extremely cheap. upon arrival, both the pan and cover were warped and ""crinkled"" in several places. i bent it back into shape with my bare hands(yes-it is that thin)and proceeded to wash it thoroughly before first use. i attempted to cook chicken but it quickly became covered with what looked like iron powder. i washed it again and had the same results. i decided to let it soak in hot soapy water and it promptly rusted out. this is the worst pan i have ever had the displeasure of using. i only leave reviews on lousy products to warn others, so you can believe this is a piece of junk. deserves zero stars or less."
2,meanderings on nationalist literature,"Under Three Flags is in many ways the antithesis of Benedict Anderson's Imagined Communities. This book claims to seek to analyze the impact of anarchists on nationalist movements and the transmission of ideas. However, the book never really focuses on anything. Rather, the book is really about nationalist literature, mostly from the Philippines. And the book goes into detail about the literature and authors, so if you haven't read the original books you're out of luck.I realize this book probably wasn't meant for me, but the title seemed to suggest a much more interesting project about anarchist and anti-colonial discourse. Anderson never makes a convincing argument about these linkages. Recommended only for scholars of Southeast Asian literature."
2,"Wonderfull music, complete destroyed package","The music, the songs, the sound, the recording quality - all brillant. But the box is a complete disaster: Cheap and quick done, it broke at several parts, when i opened it the very first time (!). And this for the prize of 200 Euro and almost another 60(!) for duty. I'm really pissed off, but won't send it back; don't want to pay 60 Euro for a second package."
4,Good for youngsters,"Easily accessible and sweet movie, that parents can enjoy, too. Both my six year old and my two year old are entranced by the furry critters and gentle story."
5,Wonderful DVD,"We received this DVD about year ago and my son (age 18 months) LOVES this movie. He will sit and watch it, plus loves to dance to the music. Enjoyable for the adults to watch alo. I highly recommend this! The books that go along are also wonderful!"
5,Great,"This movie is a wonderful movie for both young and old. It is both cute, funny, and a good lesson for little kids. I hope you enjoy it."
5,Very sweet movie for toddlers and young ones,"My little boy started watching this on long car rides when he was only 2 years old. It is very sweet and brings lots of smiles. I highly recommend it if you want your child fascinated with nature and its critters, it teaches how to work together and empathy."
4,Dated but entertaining murder-mystery,Old-fashioned (1930s) murder mystery. Well-written and entertaining if a little humourless. The politeness of all concerned date it badly but also provide it with an endearing quaintness.
2,"I give it a 2 star, for little durability...","This sure was a great idea, and a great product, for about a month or two. Heck, for the price, that's worth it, but it only lasted my dad a month, and me about the same before the clip became very loose due to the spring being faulty. This causes the whole product to become very wobbly and untrustworthy of carrying my 30- 40 dollar zippos."
1,Do NOT buy this !,I love Zippo products bu this one is not worth it. Made in China. The spring clip broke after only a couple of weeks. Also the way in wich the Z Clip holds the lighter will definately scuff your finis pretty bad. Buy only for very light use.
4,good,"The product is convenient and nice, however, the materials used to make the clip are not durable and it will break eventually."
2,Zippo Z-Clip Lighter Belt Clip (Lighter Not Included) -121506,"item broke after second day of use, waiting to hear about return, pin broke from plastic just a weak designi guess"
4,Power Pop Greats!,"This is a great double-disc collection of the Scientists in their power pop phase, which happens to be my favorite. For fans of the Only Ones, Stiv Bators and the Damned. The CD includes one of their better known songs, ""Last Night"", an upbeat super catchy tune a lot like the Saints, ""I'm Stranded."" It's also got the standouts, ""Bet Ya Lyin'"" and ""That Girl"".The CD contains a few live tracks and not all of it is the greatest quality, but it's still a good collection of this Australian group.If you love the 1976-82 period of underground punk and power pop, there's a good chance you'll really enjoy this CD set."
3,"some amazing songs, some so so","this is definitly worth getting for the opening track alone ""frantic romantic"". there are a couple scattered gems on this obscure punk artifact. a ""must get"" if you like sloppy punk from the late 70s with moments of song writing genious here and there."
1,does not work,"I was tricked into buying this after reading the review, I wore it several times after I got it and got suspicious as I did not feel any benefit. I went online and try to find out more about this technology, if you do some googling you will know that it has no scientific evident and major trustworthy health and science site also urge people to not fall for this. I should have done my homework before spending money."
3,It worked but...,"These wrist bands are a good Phiten product, however, I wouldn't recommend that they be used for playing volleyball (they get in the way). Probably better suited for baseball or basketball."
5,Movie,Was excited that this movie still was available --- as I saw it when I was about 6 years old --- it was very scary back then as I remembered. I'm now 70 --- glad I found it.
4,Ryuichi Sakamoto - Prayer / Salvation,"Ninja Tune offers remixes of Ryuichi Sakamoto's Prayer/Salvation. Obviously, this different set of remixers result in different tracks, but the emphasis is less on drum `n' bass and more on house, downtempo and abstract works. Ashley Beedle, of course, offers a class house remix of ""Salvation"" and J Swinscoe of the Cinematic Orchestra works his clarinet-and-bass jazz magic. Fink goes ambient, then drum `n' bass, while Pan Sonic and Oval glitch up ""Prayer"" and ""Discord"" respectively. Andrea Parker rounds out the rest of the mixers with some abstract trip-hop. A fascinating collection."
1,"Fundamental thoughts, poorly written.","My professor said that Isaiah Berlin was as big in his circles as Elvis was in his. Berlin's thoughts are outstanding, but his writing is poor. A former editor of _The_New_Yorker_ said to Berlin, ""I haven't understood a thing you've said, but if you have something to publish, I'll publish it.""It is unfortunate that such a 'great thinker' would put his ideas out of reach of the masses by making his work so difficult to read. If you want to read this book, or any of Sir Isaiah's work, give it a shot. Be warned, though, you'll have to read it very carefully about four times before you understand what he's trying to say. I would suggest finding a book that presents Berlin's ideas without the bulk of his words."
4,Exactly what was requested,"My husband was very excited to get this CD for Christmas. He had it when he was younger and lost it in a car accident. My only complaint is that it was shipped in an old LP album cover and he knew it had to be for him! Other than that, great service."
2,slow going,This video does not work up to breaking a sweat. It is for the extreme beginner who wants an introduction to working out. They go over the steps too slow and do not spend enough time actually working out. The dance steps are simple and few. I bought this video because it was recommended as a dance video. It has your typical workout moves and two very basic latin dance steps. It is a slow going work out video that does not keep you engaged.
4,Excellent and Complete workout!,"This video provides a complete workout. Cardio and weights. Giselle, Daisy's trainer, is great. She is energetic and enthusiastic. I think this is a great video!"
4,Feel the ground shake!,"What an amazing freshman effort. Tombstone has a raw, garage rock/punk feel to it.I have seen them live in Southern California on several occasions and have found them more appealing live than recorded. They really enjoy performing and their music lends itself to live performance. Loud, Fast and psychotic!"
4,Real Classics,"This Album has some real deep classic tracks, back when hip-hop was still trying to say something. Some of these songs were on my personal mix tapes that were recorded from the radio around '88 and had no clue of who they were, I bought the album for Main Source, it turns out I got a butt load of bonus tracks. I gave four stars for the variety."
2,Dogs of 9-11,"Atlas was just too old, but Dumas book was horrible. Poor quality paper; pictures broken in half across 2 pages. An 'F' in high school photography class. Battery price was comparable to Home Depot pricing after all."
4,Acting at its greatest,This movie has a good storyline which supports some of the most spectacular acting I have seen in all of my movie watching days! I would recommend anyone who hasn't seen this movie to buy it and watch carefully for the great storyline and awesome acting.
1,Pretentious and indulgent!,"This well-shot first feature from James Gray features good performances from some fine actors, but is sunk by its hopelessly muddled, pretentious screenplay. Gray seems more interested in imitating people like Coppola, Scorsese, Bergman and Visconti (to name a few) than he does in telling an honest story from his heart. The result is a cold, almost clinical study of a Russian Jewish family and their two troubled sons, one of whom is a hit man for the mob. The result is also uninvolving emotionally. Instead of trying to show us how clever and brilliant you are, James, why not just tell an honest story from your heart? The talent is obviously there. A real disappointment, considering the talent of all involved."
3,Powerful flick,"The story of a hitman named Joshua,who comes back to his childhood neighborhood in Brooklyn to do a hit. This soon starts trouble when he is reunited with his family. His mother is dying of a brain tumor, his father is a boozer and cheater who refuses to show any respect to his long lost son, and his little brother whom is so vulnerable to his brother's violence. A crime drama unlike others, which to say in a good way. Moves kinda slow at times, but other scenes are so powerful and rich that you won't even care. It also gives you a hard-edged look on Russian-American gangster life in NYC."
2,Too many unanswered questions...,I don't have a lot to say about this movie except that it is not your typical mob drama and the family tragedy spewed on some major depression. This movie was not what I expected and the storyline had too many holes in it.
5,Best Ever Historical Fiction Work on Western History,"Have read the book several times--always very much hoped that Berger would do some sort of sequel, and here it is."
5,The Old West: Wild and Funny,"111-year-old Jack Crabb relates part of his life story, from the time he was kidnapped and raised by the Cheyenne to the time he was the only white survivor at Custer's Last Stand. Berger writes with great wit and authority. To my mind it's one of the best novels of the last half of the 20th century. If you saw the movie with Dustin Hoffman, be assured that the book is just as good, even better. In terms of the western genre (which really is an unfair way to categorize this novel), it is on a par with Larry McMurtry's LONESOME DOVE, another one of the great novels of the last century."
4,A good collection of his songs,"This CD did worst the expenses, and does show up with hist best songs.Shipment,Price and shape of the CD did satisfy."
3,mixer failed,"Julio Iglasias is an all time wonder! However, the mixer on this album overwhelmed his superlative lyrics by putting the orchestra in the front, on top of his wonderful singing. It's a bit less on disk two but disk one is hard to hear the lyrics of not only Mr. Iglesias but those singing with him. What a shame to ruin such a wonderful collection. Of course everyone should own these songs.I'm a bit disappointed."
5,"His voice is very evoking emotionally, and sensually","I grew up listening to his music, and at an young age, I thought he was very strikingly handsome and flirtatious. I never stop listening to his music that reminds me of simple times when it was okay to just flirt with someone and not do anything else afterwards. Through his songs, he brings out the true and real romance that should exist in today's relationships. I still think, twenty years later, that he is a handsome, sexy guy. Thank you for your music Iglesias!"
1,Scratches,I would not buy from this seller again.The review said great condition-and the one song I really wanted it for has the scratch.
3,PEANUTBUTTER IS RED LIGHT FOOD,"Weight Watchers calls addictive foods ""red light foods."" Add chocolate to peanut butter and I am hooked.I bought this book for the peanutbutter shortbread recipe, recommended by Alexis Stewart on Sirrius radio's ""Whatever"" with Alexis and Jennifer.There are three recipes that I plan to try, and the peanutbutter shortbread was a hit with my family. I added chocolate to 1/3 of the recipe and had a bi-level shortbread. Red lights flashing!"
5,Best gift ever...,Cookbook was given as a gift along with Peanut Butter & Co. peanut butter. Some great recipes in this book! Great combo gift and was well received!
4,Damn good(and creative) weird fiction,"Although not entirely blown away by Cisco's first work, I am appreciative of his project as an author; combining literary traditions and siting influences including Tolkien and Lovecraft, two of the 20th-century's greatest ""genre"" writers, Cisco can count me among his target audience. His ultra-bizarre, seductive, psychedelic and trance-inducing prose lends a certain conviction to his otherworldly backdrop and story. Most of the action and story elements occur between the lines, and what the reader's imagination creates from these suggestions is the magic and power that make this work remarkable. Recommended for all those who constantly wonder, ""How real is the 'real world'?"""
2,Biased history book,This book while interesting is not very accurate. I am deeply opposed to any criticism of Patrick Henry as he was the greatest of our founding fathers. His wisdom and ability to communicate was unsurpassed. The only person to criticize him was Jefferson and he was jealous in my opinion.
1,Weber Grill Cover,The product does not fit my grill. I have a version that I bought 10 years ago and it has handles at the end opposite the fire pot. The grill cover does not work. Is there a way I can return the one you sent? Do you have one that will cover my grill. I am sure Weber has the specifics about the product I own.
4,A perfect fit!,"I don't have much to add except that as a petite 5' tall person, I was surprised to find that the large cover wasn't difficult to pull on. There is seemingly nothing for it to snag on and the proper orientation is fairly obvious. It properly covers the bottom shelf. Unlike the photo on Amazon.com, the sides hang straight as opposed to tightening up at the bottom. I only gave it 4 stars because I'm sure there's room for enhancements (e.g. zippered clear pocket, a strap for hanging the cover or rolling it up while grilling...)."
1,Shrinks and Degrades,"After a year in the Florida sun, this cover shrank and is now unusable. I am very disappointed with the quality."
5,Great Stapler,I'm using this stapler with some cardboard & mylar 2x2's for coins.It works great with regular staples and punches through with much less effort than a standard swingline stapler. (Milton would love it)I haven't noticed any extra effort required for flat-clinching (works great).
5,Best desk stapler I've ever used,"This thing will staple just about anything you throw at it. The lever action inside it provides a smooth stapling process and it gives the nice flat staples - just like it says. I have a hard time keeping it on my desk as everybody in the office keeps borrowing the thing.The only downside I've experienced is that the latch to hold the top down (for reloading staples) has a light hold to the rest of the stapler. This is only bad if you pick it up by the top - it will open up to let you reload the staples. While slightly annoying, it's still an amazing stapler. Get it!!!"
2,A stapler is not a stapler...(but doesn't last!),"OK - I thought ""a stapler is just a stapler."" How different could one be than another.Well, for such a simple office tool, this one is much better. Its easy to push the staple through. But more important, the ""anvil""?? (the metal that bends the staple) is a much more intelligent design. It actually has 2 articulated parts that bend the staple completely flat. You won't catch your finger on them. As the product description states, a pile of stapled papers lies flat.One of those small, minor improvements that removes one hassle from your life. My only concern is that the strap that pulls the holder back when you open to refill is apparently a clear Mylar ribbon. Doesn't seem like it will last, but no problems so far.Worth a few bucks more for a better designed product.===Update after 6 months of light use. The staples are no longer flat - and will snag your finger, perhaps worse than normal stapler. Already looking for a replacement.Oh well....."
3,STAPLER MAX FLAT,"GREAT STAPLER, HOWEVER, I REALLY WANTED THE MAX 11 WHICH IS HALF THE SIZE INSTEAD OF THE FULL DESK SIZE VERSION. DEFINITELY GOOD FOR 30 SHEET CAPACITY."
1,Horrible / Unreliable,I bought two 5 packs and they worked flawlessly. I bought the 5 pack listed here with DVD jewel cases & all were burnt coasters. I will never buy Memorex again..... They should just stick to cassette tapes.
4,Good,This tank is good but the only bad thing about it is it doesn't have a top. Other than than it is nice and last long
5,Makes your face feel SUPER clean,"Love, Love, Love this face cleanser - nothing else makes my face feel so clean as this one. Very fine grit does not feel rough on the skin - other brands I have tried feel like sand paper - this one is very gentle."
5,Good Music,Tim McGraw has some good music. His second volume of hits is amazing. I listen to it all the time!! Its a CD you can definately listen to over and over again!
3,"ATTN ""WHEN THE STARS GO BLUE"" FANS","I like Tim McGraw, I don't love him. I like Tim McGraw's ""When the Stars Go Blue,"" I DO love Ryan Adams' ""When the Stars Go Blue.""I've seen so many reviews calling ""When the Stars Go Blue"" one of Tim McGraw's best songs, when really it's not even his song. Ryan Adams wrote, played, sang, and recorded it first and did a much better job than McGraw can ever hope to do.However, McGraw doesn't butcher the song like I would have initially expected, it's actually not half bad.If you want to hear the original song listen to Ryan Adams' ""Gold"" album. You won't be let down, I swear.Oh and I hate to knock on McGraw, but Ryan Adams is my boy. I love his music and it bothers me to see Tim McGraw get all of this recognition for a song that isn't really even his."
2,not the best,Not Tim's best work. I only liked 1 of the tracks. Spend your money on his most recent albums. I don't think these were his greatest hits.
1,Pimp-daddy McGraw,"My boss and I agree on one thing: Tim McGraw looks like a sleazy, back-alley-lurking, bottom-of-the-barrell, slime-ball pimp-daddy, and those are his good points. The fact is, without studio wizardry he wouldn't have any hits. His voice is absolutely colorless, meaning, basically that he has to whine his way through entire songs just to try and convey the simplest emotions. I'm a big fan of country music WHEN IT'S GOOD. This guy does not fit that bill."
5,"Greatest Hits, Vol. 2 Tim McGraw","Great, I cant seem to get enuff of this CD. This is one CD thit is still in my cd player. If you like Tim McGraw you should like this CD."
5,Best Artist,"Tim Mcgraw is one of the best god damn artist out there.He got it all, Songs style and music skills.contenuing strong after years in music,and even given refrince in song from new and next up artist like Taylor Swift."
4,"Not the best, but the best of the mediocre albums by BJ.","Of course, live albums are never Billy's specialty. He robs the tenderness from She's Got a Way and marres the grand scale texture of Billy the Kid. But this wonderful album contains excellent versions of Say Goodbye to Hollywood, Miami 2017, Captain Jack and I'v e Loved these Days. Essential for any Billy Joel Fan."
5,What Billy Joel is all about. Period.,"Being a Long Islander who works in Washington and who goes home only once in a while, Billy Joel's ""Songs in the Attic"" is required for the drive home. As soon as I hit the Verrazano Bridge, heading towards Brooklyn and the Belt Parkway, Billy Joel goes into the CD player and reminds me of what New York and Long Island are all about. His liner notes are dead on when he says ""there is no Miami 2027 without MSG."" Billy Joel's music IS Long Island - sweeping suburbs, tough guys, fisherman and a mentality that only people born there can fully understand. The album that fully reveals these thoughts is ""Songs in the Attic."" Hooray for an album that while meant to be a breather turned out to be a synthesized symbol of the place where Billy Joel grew up and has obviously left his heart."
3,Some of the songs should have stayed in the Attic,"If you do get this album, get it for the fantastic rendition of Miami 2017, a freewheeling, rollicking rock suite with some of Joel's most aggressive lyrics ever. There are good versions of Captain Jack and Billy the Kid- fun stuff, really, and a pretty though simple tune in ""She's got a way"".Most else is well below the quality of songwriting that is Billy Joel's reputation. Some of his worst stuff is on here, such as the mediocre melody ""Streetlife Serenade,"" though it is enhanced by some gutsy guitar work, as well as the faux-latin ""Los Angelenos"" done on a chintzy electronic piano at Toads Place in New Haven. Even the hit ""Say Goodbye to Hollywood"" is OK and fine, it's just well below his reputation for good song writing and melody making."
5,Simply the Best,I've been a huge Billy Joel fan for nearly 30 years now....This album is probably my favorite along with the stranger
5,Essential Billy Joel,"Songs In The Attic is a very unique live album...a collection of his early songs that were recorded on tour during 1980 in some very diverse settings.Classic epic songs Miami 2017 and The Ballad of Billy The Kid were recorded in New York's Madison Square Garden and more warmer songs You're My Home, Everybody Loves You Now and Summer Highland Falls were recorded in the intimate setting of the club Bayou in Washington D.C. He captured the perfect ambience for this diverse collection of his early songs. The insightful and humorous liner notes about the songs and his touring crew are a nice addition to this delightful revival of Billy Joel's early and previously infrequent heard songs.Billy and his stellar backing band really bring these songs new life and establishes this new ""live"" collection of older songs as an essential Billy Joel album."
4,Billy's Best,"I'm not much of a billy joel fan, but this is really a remarkable effort. Up there with Joni Mitchell's 'Miles of Aisles' as an endearing document to Joel's uncorrupted talent.Unfortunatley, Joel veered towards schmaltzy commercialism almost immediatley after this album's release (although 'the Nylon Curtain,' which came after this, was pretty good).These songs are personal, almost auto-biographical. There is romantacism to tracks like 'Summer Highland Falls,' with 'You're My Home' being perhaps the best song Joel has written."
5,Live never sounded so good,"This is without a doubt the best live album I own. I won't say it's the greatest ever recorded because that would be overstepping my musical boundaries. From the first song to the last, you will find this entire set engaging. Some people do think of Billy Joel as a writer of sappy love songs and he has his share of those, but this album shows him at his absolute peak. The fact that he chooses songs that were never hits just adds to the enjoyment of this record. I recently purchased his new years eve 2000 live concert, hoping to recapture lightning in a bottle but was extremely dissapointed. If you long to experience Billy Joel at his best then this is the disc for you. And as he says in the liner notes, turn it up as loud as you can!"
3,A cow-boy travelling time,"If you like time-travel movies, and cow-boys, and professors, and antiques nuts, you will like this one. Emotion and fun are there too. I can't wait a new release of this video: HURRY."
4,Timestalkers,"Although I am not a Sci-fi fan, must say that this is one of the most enjoyable movies I have seen on our local TV. Ths must have been about ten fifteen years ago and now that I am retired, with more time on my hands, I enjoy watching the ones I feel worth a second round.Please Amazon make a DVD available at a reasonable price"
1,$100??? $200??? What a joke!!!,"This is an enjoyable old sci-fi movie that is never aired any more. I like it, but not at the gouged prices of these sellers!!! It's no wonder the bootleggers are doing so well, because today I searched this title and found dozens of them available for under $10 on dvd-r. Nuff said."
1,Satifaction,As long i did`nt recieve my product i can only say stay away from dealer. It can`t be true it should take more than 3 month to recieve it.
3,Okay,"This product is much cheaper than the name brands, but contains the same active ingredients. My kids go through SO much fluoride rinse, it's ridiculous, so I bought them a whole case. I think the tops of the bottles are supposed to blink to let you know how long to swish for - but I have not seen that happen on any of the bottles - thus the lower rating. Great price for a whole case."
4,great music,"JGW is a throwback artist. he mixes humor, reality, and great music. he is truly on top of his game with this musical piece."
3,"A good sonny chiba movie, but pretty boring for a while","But I made it through it. It starts off with Masutatsu Oyama coming to compete in the first martial arts tournament after World war II. Though a fictional account, the movie is overall very dark and tries to hit on some key points in Oyama's life. KArate Bullfighter is the other name of this movie and if you know about the life of Masutatsu Oyama, then you will be familiar with that name. Though very cheesy and a bit boring, their is a badly done, but good story in here. The very end is short and sweet but overall the final fight is pretty dam good.DVD quality offered by Good times Entertainment is acceptable and sound quality is fine and dubbing is pretty funny."
1,"Yuck! Mean, Mean, Mean","I love this series, but hated this book! I started with Ice Queen, what a beautiful story. This was just mean, I did not feel any of the love story other people found. I hate Violet, a horrible person wish she would have been shot instead! Skip this one..."
5,What are you waiting for?,"A must buy for all erotic romance fans. Buy it, read it again and again, and let your heart be touched and your eyes be opened. You too will become a JWH fan!"
5,HOT :),"This was the first book I've read with the female in Dom role. I didn't think I'd like it, but I did. The book was smoking hot. I will say that the plot toward the end bored me, but the rest of the book more than made up for it.... I could have just been in a mood the day I read the last quarter of the book, who knows. This one is another keeper, and I am definitely buying more of her books. She just writes beautifully. FYI the entire book is BDSM and I would not describe it as ""lite"", so if you like it vanilla and can't warm to it, then it's not for you."
3,Not too bright and poorly designed....,"These lights are not very bright (since the plastic bottles are dark), and the bottles fall off from the bulbs quite easily. Not a bad item, but should be priced under 12 dollars, in my view."
2,Pierre Bensusan in Concert,Pierre Bensusan in ConcertI purchased the DVD on the 5 star recommendation listed and was disappointed. Pierre Bensusan is a good finger picker but is by no means a great one. If you want to hear a good picker purchase one of Tommy Emanuel's concert DVDs.
3,Pretty Good,"Some of his insights are very good, but I still cannot believe this guy has his own liberal radio show, that is supposed to be serious opposition to Rush or Sean Hannity. He is in some ways a disgrace to liberals, because he makes fun of everything. Any serious attempt to have a liberal side to talk radio should include a more serious approach. Franken is a clown, and he is very funny..but he doesn't belong in politics.Jeffrey McAndrewauthor of ""Our Brown-Eyed Boy"""
2,"Oh, the Things He Doesn't Need to Share!",This is not Al's best work. It's more rambling than usual and not so pithy. I got it for cheap and got enough laughs to justify my purchase.
5,"Oh, the Puzzling Poor Reviews You'll Read","If you're expecting one of Franken's biting political satires, you'll be disappointed. If you're expecting Stuart Smalley, you'll be disappointed. If you have no expectations whatsoever, and your sense of humor is even remotely in tune with Franken's, you'll have a blast (plan on a) chuckling a lot, b) laughing hysterically only slightly less, and c) even (who knew?) being moved from time to time). Though it is mostly wiseacre (no slight intended), OTIK is, in places, also quite wise. It is a very quick read, more entertainingly digested in one fell swoop, IMHO, than piecemeal. OTIK is proof positive, as though further proof were necessary, that Al Franken is one very funny (and thoughtful) guy. I loved it!"
2,"Oh, the Money I Could Have Saved","Oh, he's done better. I agree with earlier comments that this book is not up to Al Franken's usual standards. He spends what seems like half of the book reminding the reader his primary reason for writing the book was to generate some revenue (yes I know he's trying to be funny, it just doesn't work), and the rest of the book boring the reader with less than stellar attempts at humor. I have always enjoyed Al Franken's humor, but this book leaves me shaking my head."
3,"Oh, how annoying this gimmick gets!","This is supposed to be a sharp and witty satire of inspirational books. Franken followed the self-help format well, but I never really laughed at his self-deprecating witticisms. His other books are much better. Throughout this, I couldn't help but think that Dave Barry could have done this topic much better.Franken fans may well enjoy this, but I don't think it has wide appeal.One funny passage was on [p. 73]: ""My son...plays...Grand Theft Auto III, in which the object is to pick up a prostitute in a stolen car and murder her. It's not my kind of thing. But when I was young, I listened to the Beatles, which my parents viewed with equal horror. Today, the Beatles are cultural icons, revered around the world. By the time my son is my age, the same will probably be said of the wizards behind Grand Theft Auto III."""
3,"Oh, the [Insert semi-witty phrase here]","While reading this book I got the strange feeling that he was doing this for money. I might have been the shortness of the book. Or maybe the roughness of it. But I think I got this feling from the fact that he tells me, the reader, on numerous occasions that he needs the cash. And furthermore, I had read Rush Limbaugh just before this and noticed many remarkingly similar, infact identical, jokes. If you want a classic Franken book, don't get this one."
2,Wait for the video,"I was disappointed in this book. Although I very much enjoyed Al Franken's ""Rush Limbaugh Is A Big Fat Idiot"", I found this book lacking in both humor and depth. It is clearly a half-hearted effort."
5,Really Funny; I've Listened to It A Couple of Times,"More like a series of Saturday Night Live-style monologues rather than advice. Favorites include, ""Oh, The Bad Investments You Will Make"", ""Oh, If You Engage in Bondage/Sado-masochism Make Sure You Use a Safeword"", ""Oh, How You Will Hate Your First Job"". Strongly recommend the audio version (tape or download), which is read by him, Al Franken."
2,oh the mistakes i make in a bookstore,"Al Franken is a funny guy, and I've enjoyed him on SNL back in those halcyon days. But-- This book is like a very prolonged standup routine, or one of his valedictorian addresses. It is mildly amusing, but NOT WORTH $$$--I couldn't help but think of all the trees that were chopped down to make the paper for this fluff-piece he admittedlywrote on airplanes and I suppose while in the can. This isone of those books that is fun to thumb through in a bookstore, but it joins the teeming mountain of fluff booksthat litter every bookstore, books that you wonder how theyever got published. It's mildly amusing, BUT NOT WORTHPAYING FOR, BELIEVE ME! I have learned my lessonand you will thank me, too."
3,Franken's Throwaway,"Al Franken is a very funny man. 'Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot' was an absolutely hilarious tome, and 'Why Not Me' was not far behind. Unfortunately, this new book, while entertaining overall, just doesn't pack in the laughs as much as his prior efforts. There are exceptions: the Chapter Summaries are almost uniformly funnier than the chapters themselves, and the section on Al's commencement speeches is side-splitting. I just hoped for a lot more from this master satirist."
3,Oh so so,"This book is fun in the same way as watching someone slip on ice. You laugh for a few seconds as the person flops around and then spend the rest of your time in shared agony.I did have a few hee hee moments, but not the Prozac induced belly laughs as the other reviewers on this page.Amusing yes... hilarious, oh I don't think so."
2,"Oh, How This Book Doesn't Work for Its Market","If you can endure Franken's cycle of hilarious writing to crap to writing about how crappy it is before finally getting back to the good stuff, go for it.""Oh, the Things I Know"" takes great pains to steer clear of incindiary comments so that lots and lots of people who don't know a college graduate well enough to get them something they really want will buy this book as a graduation gift.Unfortunately for Franken, he's playing to the right audience - the over 35 buyer of the gift for a college graduate - who will likely flip through a few pages and chuckle before setting it back down. Because the book isn't comforting, uplifting or even really that funny for the market.[...]"
3,Provocative,"Al Franken is known to possess an extremely dry sense of humor. Therefore it is not surprising that his book is as parched as the man himself. Each chapter is utterly short and sweet. Every time a reader thinks the writer is supplying a real good advice the next sentence jolts the reader back to reality i.e. Al Franken is a comedian. Namedropping is abundance. Name-calling seems to be a norm. This man really knows how to make full use of the freedom of speech in the USA - nothing's wrong with that. But, chapter after chapter of similar ranting kind of tires one out after a while albeit the laugh-out-loud jokes that can be found in certain parts of the book."
1,I'm glad I borrowed this at the library,"The title should be ""Oh, the things you will read, but shouldn't have.""This book is in the same league as Steve Martin's ""Pure Drivel."" There were a few passages that provided some insite into the workings of Al Franken's pysche, however they went away quickly and we were left with stories of his Enron investment's and subsequent need for fund raising activities, such as authoring books.If you love Al, borrow the book. If not, don't bother."
1,"Not funny, not helpful","Not worth the 2 hours it takes to read. It's about as important as an Al Franken spot on Letterman, an entertaining enough interview but well, that's free. This is far inferior to the Ben Stiller/Janeane Garafolo book of a similar vein. Methinks the dullest folks from Franken's generation who now also have kids and too-high budgets may like this drivel. Anyone could write this, it's water-cooler chit chat at it's worst."
2,"Oh, the money you could save!","If you really feel the need to read this rather bland work, I'd suggest just borrowing a copy from the library. While Al Franken's previous works are among my favorites in humor, I couldn't even bring myself to finish the second half of this book."
5,Legendary collection,"This guy has more talent then he knows what to do with. It's hard for me to praise this collection since he really does make coherent albums. Lots of these songs make a lot more sense in the context of the albums from where they came. But in any context, the man's compositional range is staggering. Hopefully there will be more."
5,First album I ever bought,Just buy it because you know all of the songs and can make your husband crazy singing them all out of tune in the car...
4,Billy Joel Greatesdt Hits,"Let's be realistic. If you own ""Piano Man"" and ""The Stranger"" you have the majority of the songs on this 2-CD set. The rest of the songs here don't measure up to the songs from those two albums that he left out. If you don't own ""Piano Man"" and ""The Stranger"", buy them instead of this.If you like them, buy ""52nd Street"" and ""Glass Houses"".Forget about the rest, they're just a waste of money. In trying to show that he wasn't a balladeer Joel turned rocker - big mistake. He's a great balladeer - but as to being a rocker nobody is ever going to confuse him with his buddy Elton John. But those albums that I did mention should be in any collection and my collection is 95% Classical - not even the Beatles measure up to Mozart.;)"
2,Son Downloaded This,"When my step-son came to visit last weekend, he used my credit card to purchase this album. Now my computer is full of porn viruses."
1,very disapointed,"I received the the greatest hits cd's and was very excited to play the vol 1 CD. However as soon as I put the cd in my player said CD error. The whole CD would not play. There are no visible scratches on the CD. It is simply a faulty cd. I then put the vol 2 CD in my player and it works fine. I am extremely disappointed, especially since I don't much care for the songs on vol 2. I was really looking forward to these CDs."
5,Stays in the changer from now on,"O.K.--so there may be a *few* missing titles here, but honestly the breadth of this collection is astounding. This CD is one you will never feel the need to trade-in, and it can truly stay in the changer forever.This is truly a compilation befitting an artist with Joel's staying power. For those of you who are casual Joel fans, buy it for ""Piano Man,"" and be prepared to fall in love!"
5,G.H. 1 & 2....pure delight!,"Billy Joel, one of music's top men, has given us hit after hit over the years. He is, without a doubt, one of the best-possibly the best? Well, that is up to personal speculation; we will leave any speculation-though, with this disc, how could there be any-to the eye of the beholder. This double disc is packed with one hit, then another, followed by another-you get my drift. 'Only the good die young' and 'it's still rock and roll to me' are my presonal favorites. The classic, 'piano man' is here;' so are many others. give this compilation a chance; you won't be disappointed! p.s. if you like elton john,the eagles, or even fleetwood mac, you will love mr. joel."
4,A good collection of a great career,"Covering Joel's career from the early 70's to the mid 80's, this collection does a fine job of capturing the different styles of music that Joel was able to incorporate successfully into his diverse albums. From ballads to rockers, to story songs, there was little limit to what Joel was able to accomplish. The basic difficulty with any greatest hits package for an artist of this skill is that his albums often represented a particular sound he was working with at the time, so any collection sounds like a mixture that lacks focus. However if you are a casual fan or someone who is looking for a nice assembly of hits, this should do it for you."
2,Billy Joel Greatest Hits Vol. 1 & 2,"I don't know where this c/d was made but it only plays 9 songs per side. There are 25 total songs, but I only get 18.I would have sent this product back, but after playing a couple of tracks I assumed it was ok and through out the shipping package. Next time I will know better."
1,"BJ Cashes In, or tries to...","Boy oh boy. Am I drunk or are they? The 'enhanced' addition? What in God's greeen earth is that supposed to mean? It's got no new songs, and if they were doctored up in some new extra clear way, I cannot discern the difference... Maybe Billy and his entourage who beleived that I would pay extra for a copy of this CD, when I can buy the identical original copy for $7 at my freindly neighborhood pawn shop, where hitting the highballs early that day... But it's obvious they are taking us snobbish Billy Joel enthusiasts for a ride. Save your money and take your kids to McDonalds or buy yourself a new pair of jeans at Sears... Billy will again find his way to the bargain bin..."
3,Mildly entertaining at best.,"This 2 CD compilation from Billy Jeol is, at best, mildly entertaining. If you want to hear a singer songwriter who really knew what he was doing, then I suggest that you get the two albums ""Sail Away"" and ""12 Songs,"" both of which are by Randy Newman, who is far superior to Billy Joel in every respect possible."
1,Billy Joel stinks.,"Billy Joel stinks as a singer, writes contrived songs, is more often than not an embarrassment to listen to, and is one ugly man too. His piano technique however is not bad."
3,"Good, but really not Billy Joel's TRUE best","While you really can't knock these songs, BJ's best songs are not on this double album. Yes, they are his ""hits"" but not his best. For example, if you look at the ""Turnstyles"" album (one of his best albums), and you see songs like ""Miami 2017 (Seen the Light Go Out on Broadway,"" ""Angry Young Man"" and ""Summer, Highlind Falls,"" you have to be confused why ""Say Goodbye to Hollywood"" was chosen. Unfortunately, these are mostly overplayed songs that do get boring. The exceptions are ""Captain Jack"" and ""Scenes... Resturaunt"" which were added to the Greatest Hits CD version. If you want to see BJ's best songs, instead of buying this double CD, get ""Songs in the Attic"" and either ""Turnstyles"" or ""Glass Houses."""
4,Even Two Not Enough,"Even 2 CD's aren't enough to show the scope of BJ's work.Given that, it's a good collection and worth the effort to get."
4,Absolute essential for any collection,"This is definitely one of the best greatest hits collection I've come across. Too often, these collections get finished off with too many previously released songs- this one is near perfect.I started out liking the second CD better than the first one. I guess being a child of the late 70s, I was more familiar with songs from ""Innocent Man."" However, I have made it past ""Piano Man"" and have found my way to some new favorite Joel songs- ""Scenes from and Italian Restaurant,"" ""New York State of Mind,"" and ""Say Goodbye to Hollywood."" The only song I'm not too keen on is ""Goodnight Saigon"" from the second CD.I'm a big Joel fan, but not a diehard one, so this is the perfect way to have the best of the Piano Man. Also, if you can catch him in concert- go. It's definitely worth it!Not only is this a great CD set, it's also a long set. This is definitely one that you can find in my car at almost any time!"
5,Joel Shines - A Great Collection,"A very nice summary of Billy Joel's classic period, perhaps the only CD a casual fan needs. His actual albums were good but uneven, and just about all the highlights are here - even great non-radio tunes like ""Scenes from an Italian Restaraunt"". Great care seems to have been taken to include both the smash hit singles (""Piano Man"", ""Only the Good Die Young"") and the essential tunes you may not have heard on the radio. In fact, there are only a couple of hits left off (on the second CD -the ""Innocent Man"" LP should have gotten a tad more attention given the number of singles it produced). But all the stuff you'd expect is here, as well as some pleasent surprises. The most consistant album in Joel's catalogue, this CD comes highly recommended."
4,Billy Joel Greatest Hits Volumes I &2,"Some great music I'd forgotten all about. Anyone who likes romance, rock n' roll or even blues should enjoy these two cd's. A must have in my collection of oldies but goodies."
3,Quality Product but Hits Missing,"I was impressed with the quality of the music, but I was disappointed to see some hits from the singles charts missing, like ""An Innocent Man"" (1983) and ""Honesty"" (1979).There are 25 songs on this two-CD set. Billy Joel had 31 songs on the singles charts.Note that Amazon fails to list track 11 on Volume I (""She's Always a Woman"")."
1,Highly Overrated Sap for the Boomers,"Let's be brutally honest for a moment. This music is very cheesy. More specifically, its melodramatic, sentimental, and irritatingly precious. Worse still are Joel's pretensions toward poetry and his tendency to lionize his own artistic talents. As easily as these melodies can lull the listener into a stupified ersatz bliss, they can just as easily dull the ear to much more challenging forms (eg jazz or classical). This is the worst kind of commodified, commercialized cheese, spewed forth not by some faceless record company (that would be forgivable) but by the singer/songwriter himself! Billy Joel succesfully did to rock and roll what twinkie did to foodstuffs, what the A-team did to theater and what Vanila Ice did to hip hop. If Billy Joel is languishing in some ""Hell"" of adult soft-rock contemporary music as the official review states, then its a self-imposed exile by one of that bleak wind-blown plane's arch demons himself."
5,"A good, though not complete summary of Bill's early hits","Some notable hits were left out of his first compilation, most notably ""You're my Home"", ""Honesty"", ""Miami 2017"", ""Sometimes a Fantasy"", ""An Innocent Man"", and ""Angry Young Man."" However, this compilation contains most of Billy's songs that were of any importance between 1973 and 1985. Simply put, this is a perfect compilation for anyone looking for an introduction to the works of Billy JoelMy favorite songs from VOL 1 are ""The Stranger"", ""Only the Good Die Young"", and ""Piano Man"". From VOL 2, I favor ""You May Be Right"", ""Its Still Rock and Roll to Me"", and ""She's Got a Way"".A first time listener will identify about half the songs from previous listenings on the radio. He or she will hear the music and repeatedly stimulate memory of this music in their brain. The first time I heard Billy Joel, I played this CD. I was familiar with song after song presented and soon grew to become his biggest fan in the world."
1,The new sony is very poor quality,"I bought this never having problems from Amazon.com before. They did not state that this was a Sony product and when I received it, all the CD had on it was a root kit virus. It would not even play in my CD player. When I tried to read the CD to copy and burn the ""WAV"" files to a new CD so I could just listen to the music, all there were on the CD was executables and no sound files.Sony is very poor quality now and I do not want to buy it again."
5,Please Be Careful,"I'm responding more to another comment than the book.I notice that cane river creoles are becoming increasingly popular... and some believe they are an accurate representation of all creoles of color across the board, the standards set in that family are not the same set in all families. In proclaiming their own identity... they would discredit anothers. They describe themselves as such an exclusive group... I am not disputing that for them. In many other places too there were similar communitites - but it wasn't always the case... so please take care when you make comments about ""creoles"" in general... or at least specify that you are talking about a specific group of people... i.e. the creoles of cane river vs the creoles of lafayette, new orleans, lac charles, new iberia... there are differences."
4,More French than African,"What most do not realize if they are not from this area, is the creole/mullato are much more french than they are black & most do not consider themselves as black. I do not mean this to be demeaning to the African Americans of this country, but they are not familiar with many Creole/Mullatos that I know personally, as I grew up in that area of Grant/Natchitoches parish."
5,Completely intriguing and wonderfully written,"I have read over a thousand books on Vietnam and this ranks in the top five. It is revelatory, a candid memoir of running a major oil company's petroleum assets in a war zone. It tells all: What the home office knew and preferred not knowing, leaving it to their on site managers to handle. Incredibly candid,irrefutable, informative (has one of the finest concise history's of the Vietnamese that really explains them as a people), exciting and even harrowing at points. Just a tremendous eye-witness account of doing business in the middle of a war. The author makes no bones about world class companies trading with enemy in order to protect their facilities and keep supplying the war efforts of the various contending parties. Not since Manchester's THE ARMS OF KRUPP have I read such a knowledgeable and measured history. Talk about page turner."
5,"Intelligent, but make sure you have time for it...","Mamdani succeeds in breaking the colonial political system into pieces drawing the distinction between urban direct rule which spoke the language of civil society and civil rights, and rural indirect rule, which spoke of community and culture and describes them as different faces of the bifurcated colonial state. This bifurcated system dissipated with Independence revealing the need of a new agenda for the newly created state. The first duty of the state was to bring together the different stratums in the society for the reconstruction of a both ethnical and political identity. Democracy was the prescribed solution to react against apartheid and a tribalized native society. Mamdani's claims that whereas democratization brought winds that will remove erstwhile privileges inherited from a colonial, white dominated central power; it failed to conquer the system that kept the peasants under the hold of a tribal authorit"
1,awfull,This arrived opened with no invoise and I had to put the jar in the trash I would not think anyone would eat an open jar that just arrived in the mail.
5,Unforgettable,"I read this book about 10 years ago, and it has a habit of creeping back into my thoughts on a regular basis. I knew it was something special when I read it back then. What I didn't know then was the profound impact it would have on the way I think of the world and all the humanity it contains.An optimist by nature, I related to Mr. Newman's outlook on the world and found myself reaffirmed through his experiences. It's true that he ran into some pretty bad folks and could have easily been murdered. But, for every one of these experiences, he came into contact with hundreds of good people in every country who only wished him well, and who were indeed essential in providing the sustenance he needed to eventually complete his epic adventure.You will not be able to put this book down once you start it. Read it, and remember it for a lifetime."
5,Restores Hope For Humanity,"This is a great book. One of my favorite of all time. The adventure is well written and keeps the readers interest. It is educational, entertaining, and heartwarming."
5,Good lessons by a black American,Here is a black American who realized that through hard work he could accomplish his dream. He knew no one owed him anything. He mentioned at least 4 times that serving others is greatest joy in life.
2,Kindle Edition is Better Product For Your Money,"The ""paperback"" version of this book is full of errors in grammar and even mispelled words. This is sad because the story has a unique premise and the characters come alive.Between Shadow & Light (Revised and Expanded Edition)The Kindle Edition is a better book and flows much smoother. The Kindle edition (Between Shadow & Light-Expanded & Extended Edition), will save you money, being only a $1.99, and the writing is by far better quality. So do not waste your time on the paperback for this book but do check the story out on your Kindle, and I promise you won't regret the decision."
4,Psycho on celluloid,"This movie is not for everyone. If you have read about Chopper you know that he is a self promoting, psychopath. The lead actor portrays him as he is. The movie does not gloss over the subject matter. It is brutal. It is twisted. It is Chopper. Gruesome and yet done with a hard twist of dark humor. Hey this is the guy, and this is what he is and what he was."
3,Its a cool movie,Watched it when I was younger. Wasn't as good as I remembered but it is worth watching if u haven't seen it. Its kinda wild. Was shipped fast.
2,Too small a movie for such a big life.,Eric Bana is very good in this average movie. Chopper's life needed a more personal treatment. Why? is a question I asked far too many times watching this movie. The story bobs in an ocean of blood with no life preservers or land fall in sight.In terms of violence the director was quite inventive. The screen play needed to tell us a much bigger story. The director was up to it the budget and writer were not.
1,Chops of Rubbish!,"This film was baaad! i think the storyline was weak and boring, well i fell asleep half way through so i may have missed some good parts...doubt it!anyway, i think wats his face Bana man was good in it but..hello!violent film? err, yeah just as about violent as bloody men in black! This film was not VIOLENT. It was WEAK and needed a kick up the bum bum!nothing special at all...stick to American prison films, they're much grimier n have better storylines."
1,overated,"all of these positive reviews puzzle me..i was expecting this movie to at least be watchable,..it's not..the story is obviously 80% dramatized but he claims it's real. you'd think it wouldn't be as boring as it was..a lot of things are dumb and pointless in this movie. it wasn't even that violent. the movie is kind of a joke if you ask me..it's not even worth the rent..i watched an hour and had enough"
2,Buyer Beware,"The advertising should be changed for this book. It does give a good history of the rifle but fails to provide ""hands-on"" do it yourself guides as stated in the synopsis. It doesn't tell/show you how to do your trigger, only states if building a match rifle to have the trigger done..Duh!! I really was expecting more out of this book. At the most, it is a good book for beginners. I'm mad at Amazon for not only advertising this book the way it did, but for also automatically charging 2 day shipping. It didn't give me a choice. I tried to stop the order, but was told it was already too late, but I could return it."
4,The first Italian greatest hits of Spagna,"""E che mai sarà-Le mie più belle canzoni"", is the fourth Spagna's album in italian. The ex queen of the discos, in this album proposes again her old hits, like the italian traslation of the Elton John ""The circle of life"" that is become ""Il cerchio della vita"", the ballads ""Gente come noi"", ""Lupi Solitari"", Eio pensa a te"" ""Dov'eri"" and the rhythmical songs ""Come il cielo"" ""Ti amo"", ""Lay da da"" and ""Se fosse vero amore"". There's an extra-bonus too: the italian world cup song written with Emilio Estefan:""Il bello della vita"""
4,"Ahhh, The series begins","Here you have the books that begin the nursery rhymes. Hide and Seek, Roses are Red, The Big Bad Wolf, just to name a few. You will be hooked! Get them in order."
3,Fair,Hide and Seek was fair. It started out good but I felt the James Patterson drew the plot out to long.
2,not worth buying,"I am a big James Patterson fan and this is the first time I've picked up one of his books and not been immediately riveted from the first chapter. I gave it a solid try - about halfway through - and realized that I just didn't care about what happened. I was constantly flipping back to straighten out characters. I don't know what it was but it just wasn't as good as most of his books. There's plenty of other JP book to chose from, so no need to add this one to your list."
2,Not The Best Patterson!,"James Patterson is one of my all-time favorite authors and I was very disappointed with this book. It is not a bad story if it is the first you have ever heard of or read of James Patterson. I have read all the Alex Cross novels and they all are 5 stars but this book was little to do about mystery and more about this woman's sex life,her lovers' sex lives and her past as an abuse victim. Where is the real mystery? Read it if you have nothing else to read but read all the Cross books first!"
3,I adore James Patterson but this is not his usual quality.,"My knowledge of James Patterson's abilities stems only from 2 books. ""Kiss the Girls"" & Along Came a Spider."" This book pales in comparison. It almost seems that his publisher gave him 2 days to write it and he met the deadline. I was especially frustrated with his inablility to recognize capabilities of children at varying ages. This was also evident in the aforementioned novels, but was more annoying in ""Hide & Seek."" Specifically, no four year old child would have the insight to recognize someone's inability to ""be accepting of themselves,"" no matter how brilliant the child. Four year old girls very rarely speak like 30 year old women- nor do they think like 30 year old women.This is very unrealistic & I truly wish that Mr. Patterson would keep children out of his novels until he's raised one. Regardless of these discrepancies I have to admit that the book is still readable but not recommendable."
3,Intriguing and satisfying for a suspense novel,"This book was very good. Patterson's style of writing is amazing. I only have one bad comment about it, and that was I was dissapointed at how the end turned out for Will."
3,Disappointed!!!,"This was my first James Patterson book. I had high hopes but found the writing (a) rushed, and (b) unconvincing. While the book was very easy to read and relatively enjoyable, I expected much more suspense, drama and terror. Sure there was a twist and it was a huge surprise, but I didn't really care by that stage. So it's my first...and my last. Sorry James!"
4,almost there,I have read 5 James Patterson books the Alex Cross decective ones are the best. He almost gets it here but just hope Alex never dies!!!!
5,efficient and speedy,"The book was in ""mint"" condition, and got to my home quickly. It was a low maintenance transaction. No problems!"
1,Laughable,"I don't know how anyone who likes reading can say they enjoyed this book.Not only did it not make sense - Will turning into his brother and noone noticing - but it stretched the limits of the imagination and realism even for a book.The lyrics for her song that made the lead woman famous were dreadful but were supposed to be deeply thought out. Those of you who have reviewed this book favourably, I urge you to re-read the lyrics to that song and then try not to laugh at it.Terrible book - wish I could have given it a minus number."
1,Ghost Writer?,"I find it hard to believe that James Patterson wrote this book. I am a long-time fan, and this one just fall flat...leaving me to believe that he had a little ""help"" in its writing. Far from the psychological thrillers that he's known for, Hide & Seek is more like a bad daytime soap opera, with a melodramatic protagonist (Maggie) that is so annoying that you almost hope that the murderer gets her...at least that might put her and the reader out of our collective misery."
2,Too little mystery and too much explicit sexual description,"Highly recommended, I read Hide & Seek thinking I would be rivited to my chair... not so. The plot was twisting and at times interesting but it left too many of the mystery/thriller details out. I have never read a good mystery/thriller that had so much detailed sexual information. Sex may be on everyone's mind but it did not have to be so exploited. I hate to judge an author by one book, but I certainly would not recommend this book or the author to any age readership."
2,Real fiction,"Seems that James Patterson has taken a turn, in this book anyway, towards the likes of Jackie Collins. Filled with Harlequin-esque romantics, and none of his usual suspense-filled storylines."
3,Patterson should stick to Cross,"Though a devoted fan of James Patterson, I had to force myself through this one. The plot was uncharacteristically thin, and the dialogues contrived -- especially those between Maggie and her daughter (does anybody really talk like that?!?). By far, the most interesting character was Will Shepherd. It seems to me that Patterson may not be able to write women that well, and is better suited to the criminal evolution and plot development that made 'Kiss the Girls', 'Along Came a Spider', and 'Jack & Jill' so phenomenally thrilling. Looking forward to reading 'Cat & Mouse' soon."
4,It was okay.,"The only other James Patterson book I read was Kiss the Girls, and I loved it! I couldn't put it down, and am anxiously awaiting the movie. Hide and Seek was a poor choice after such an incredible book. It was a genuine James Patterson, filled with twists, sex, murder, and a fast-paced plot, but it was a lot of nothing at times. I would recommend it, but not as highly as Kiss the Girls. Better than average, but not his best. It was okay"
1,Don't know why anyone would let this book be published?,This is the first and last book by James Patterson I will ever read. Seems to like it is just an effort to appease his editor. Probably had a deadline and had to throw something out there. Throughly dreadful
2,In a word....disappointing!,"I have read many of James Patterson's books and all I can say is that I am VERY disappointed with this one. It was slow moving and not what I expected of Patterson. Save your money!!! If you want to read a good book, read one of his others. Kiss the Girls was great and so was Along Came a Spider"
2,"""Matlock has a better story to tell""","In this television society it would appear all we expect out of a novel is a plot line that could be a script from ""Murder She Wrote"". This book might satisfy the masses but it left me wanting more: like character development, and more of a plot twist then the mundane ending we got. If you get the impulse to spend $5.95 on this one you'd be better saving your money and reaching for your remote control"
1,Definitely a disappointment!,"This is my first James Patterson read after hearing my wife rave about Kiss the Girls. I found the storyline contrived, the villain boring, and the dialogue average at best. I think it will take some convincing to ever read this author again."
1,What a disappointment!!,"About 2/3 of the way in to this book I almost stopped reading due to boredom. Then I thought I'd give Patterson the benefit of the doubt and finish it off, in case he redeemed himself... sadly, I don't think he did. The book was very predictable, the characters had no real depth (or redeeming features!) and the writing was poor. I wasn't scared for even a second. I usually like ""popcorn reads"", but this wasn't worth my time!"
5,"So Scary, i couldn't put it down!",This was the first book i have ever read by james patterson. i stayed up most of the night reading this book. it was awesome. i love the way patterson depicts his characters. i will definitely read more of his books
3,Finish it...if you can,I read a lot of mystery books and Patterson is one of my favs. But this book just didn't hold my interest. Wouldn't recommend.
4,HIDE AND SEEK IS HAUNTINGLY CHILLING,"My first James Patterson book is HIDE AND SEEK and I have been engaged by his writing since. His style of narration is personalized and most affecting. No nuances here, but HIDE AND SEEK is extremely gripping and riveting. It tells of a singer Maggie and his 3 dead lovers, and the intense characterization saves the novel from being banal, especially when Will as the devious and debonair paycho takes centrestage. He is a tortured soul and manipulates people including his brother to satisfy his virulent passions. Murders, deception and the first few chapters on Maggie's abused past is hauntingly chilling.James Patterson writes with speed and cuts to the point with precision. He dissects the character's soul with succinct description. For a fast read, he is definitely one of the best writers around. HIDE AND SEEK is definitely at the zenith of suspense - the read will induce a primal fear that you can't hide from."
2,"HIDE IT, SEEK ELSEWHERE!!","I read this on the strength of Along Came a Spider -well it just goes to show that you cant' always judge a book by its author. This is so poor it is almost as if it has been written by someone else other than the talented writer of Along Came a Spider. The characters are one dimensional and their motivations pure pop corn. There are too many irrelevant passages such as the (unnecessarily extended) account of Will's World Cup game. The plot's thin, the writing is pedestrian.........etc,etc. What worries me is I've got Kiss The Girls on order from Amazon, so I hope its been written by the real James Patterson"
1,Maggie needs a visit from Mr. Soneji,"This is solidly one of the worst Patterson books I've come across. The plot is boring and reads like a romance novel in parts and then turns into a murder/suspense novel. By the end of the book, I didn't even CARE what happened to Maggie. I wanted them to give her the chair just so we could get a little excitement in this book. Too bad Gary Soneji is dead from the Alex Cross books - I had the perfect suggestion for his next victim."
4,Good book to read.,"This is a good book to read. It has alot of good parts in it, and it has good character scheme. But the only thing is that some parts in the book shouldn't be in it. So you might have to skip some pages. But it's still a good book. Some parts in it will make you cheer and yell. I would recommend this book to anyone."
5,Great book,"I really like this J.P. book, mainly because I had only read the A. Cross books. I thought it was different and extremely SCARY. Non-stop thrill a minuet. The main character is sad and yet bold. Pattersons really has an understanding for the softer sided gender. Anyway, I know it was not one of J.P's fave's I had read a interview he gave, yet I would still recommend it, it was suspenseful."
3,Great no brainer,"I bought this book to read on a cross country flight. I had if finished half way through my lay over. It is thought provoking and scary. The words are all easy (a 12 year old could comprehend it). If you don't feel much like thinking and want some TV style entertainment,this is the ticket. It is a story about a woman forced to kill her first husband who abused her, when she finally remarried-she found herself in the same situation again. Does she suffer the beatings and threats to her life? Or does she risk explaining to a judge how she shot two men?"
3,Patterson can do better,"This book reads like a mediocre Lifetime movie.Maggie Bradford is a rather cliched character that lives a very surrealistic existence. Quite honestly, she is a fairly unsympathetic protagonist.Will Shepherd is a fascinating character that keeps this novel from being a complete waste of time. He's a womanizing, crude, violent, worldwide superstar.While on the World's stage as one of the most well known athletes, he manages to lead a rather turbulent existence that leaves him alienated from the rest of the world. Through bad relationships and a brother he has to blackmail to keep quiet about his dark side, Will is a lost and depressed human being that is incapable of finding peace from within.He looks to Maggie Bradford to save him from his despair, but he finds that she is not the anecdote for what poisons him. It is at this point that Maggie finds history repeating itself for her and her troubled relationships."
1,"Can I have my time back, please?","This book was my first introduction to the author. Unfortunately, I never want to be in the same room as one of his books ever again. The first chapter, err, several chapters since the be oh so tiny, try to focus the reader on Maggie's penchant for murdering her husbands. Our fine heroine, Maggie, beaten and hiding under the porch, shoots her husband while he is in the midst of a murderous, drug induced rampage. The police almost charged her with murder since the poor husband obviously left no tell-tail sign of violence other than the house interior smashed and trashed and Maggie having served hospital time due to her injuries. Yes, I can see where the police would initially think ""Hmm, murder"". The setup for the second husband is equally poorly conceived.The book was plodding, nonsensical, trite and predictable. It became landfill. The paper deserved to come back as something worthwhile."
3,Flawed but not terrible,"Hide & Seek was the first book I ever read by James Patterson and despite some flaws I really liked it. Some other reviews complained of its simple writing style and while that can be annoying I found it refreshing different from what I was accustomed to reading. The novel always had me turning its pages as well and while critiques on the characters are valid I thought they were okay. However, the biggest problem I have with this novel is that everything is jarring. For example the novel mostly seems to be told in flashback perspective from Maggie but instead of Maggie telling us when she met Will we hear from both their perspectives before they actually meet. I was glad that I only paid 25 cents for it though, anything over $7 and I would have felt ripped off."
1,Laughably bad - but I read the whole thing for some reason.,"OK, sometimes you pick up a free paperback on the book exchange table because you need a mindless book for the airport. I had read another James Patterson title, ""Kiss the Girls"" and although the writing style made me wince, the plot and suspense kept me interested. This one, however, is so bad that you might just read it in disbelief that a publisher could print this nonsense. It is seriously like a high school creative writing assignment. Actually, no, strike that, I don't want to offend any high school students. Middle school? Anyway, it reads really fast and it can be amusing in the way a bad movie is amusing. Just smile and think ""I can't believe this was published"" while reading your borrowed copy. Garbage."
3,"shallow,but entertaining enough","James Patterson seems to have mastered the craft of fairly entertaining,mindless pageturners quite brilliantly.As a matter of fact,in you're in a market for a quick read,that will touch neither your heart,nor your mind,but will surely kill time,this is a book for you.The characters are all too stereotypical and predictable,however the plot does throw in a curveball or two.he writing style is average at best and quite devoid of charm or humor in itself.To sum up,the waters are only ankle deep,but warm enough to enjoy."
3,Hooked by a Thriller,"This was the first book by James Patterson that I have read and well, HE HOOKED ME. In the beginning it was a slow book and I felt I should return it to the shelf. But then as the book went on I just could not put it down. The characters were great and the suspense was a killer. I was not extrememly impressed by the book but if this is one of his worst then i can't wait to read his best. ALL AND ALL I ENJOYED READING IT."
5,Jaw Dropping Ending That You'll Never Guess,"Maggie Bradford killed her first husband Phillip, who was voilent. Years later she meets a famous soccer player named Will Sheperd, who seems nice but turns out to be worse than Maggies first husband. Now Maggie is the main suspect of Wills death. I really enjoyed this book, the suspense is breath taking and will have you at the edge of your seat. I think this has an ending almost if not better than Hitchcocks movie ""Psycho"". Every second there is a big twist as to whether or not Maggie killed Will. At the trial Maggie says she didn't kill Will, but the jurors wonder, who could have killed Will, and what was the reason. When you read what Will has done to the people he has met, you will question as to who Killed Will. Through out the story I just kept on changing my guess as to who the killer is. Just when you think you know who the killer is ""guess again"". The outcome of this mystery will leave you breathless."
3,not bad but not the best,"I felt like I was reading a Sidney Shelton book. I have to admit it started very Shelton-ish but became Patterson towards the end. The ""mystery"" was back. This book wasn't as good as the usual Alex Cross series but I enjoyed reading it. The only big complaint I have is it kind of dragged. I thought it was too long for a simple story like this. This book is not the best but not the worst either. I would recommend it if you're truly bored."
3,"Like Another Person Said, Not The Best Patterson.","This book was REALLY draggy until the ""Trial and Error"" section. That was the part when the book turned into true Patterson work. But overall, it was a wonderful read. It was kind of like one of those movies that takes FOREVER to get to the point, but when it finally does, you realize that all those boring parts were necessary to make the movie, or book in this case, what it is..."
3,Pretty Good One,"I have liked all books by the author thus far. I was trying for an Alex Cross featured one at the library but got this one. No regrets. Good story here with Maggie always questioning herself as to whether she's a murderess or just a victim of circumstance. Will Sheppards story was equally good. The best was when the two were together. Good side characters with Barry, Norma, Allie and Jennie. Well put together. Only exception being Maggie held in Bedford Hills C.F.(State Prison) before trial instead of Westchester County Jail. All things told, I liked the story and look forward to reading all of Mr. Patterson's work."
4,"4 1/2 Stars. Scary, Suspenceful!","This is by far the Scariest James Patterson Book of all. It is shocking twisted, well written and very frightning. James Patterson has all the burnes cooking with this erotic thriller.A Murder, and another murder. Now a woman is in prison. The only twist they were both self defense. In a way I think this was what Double Jeopardy (movie) was based on, because it is severely twisted."
4,Hide & Seek,"I've read nearly every book James Patterson published. Hide & Seek is just as riviting as any other. The characters are well developed, you find yourself attached to Maggie, really wanting to know more about her. Finding the truth in her past seems to be the last thing on your mind while reading. The only complaint I have is that I feel that he ended the book a few times. Once you feel comfortable it the ending another bone was thrown in to late. James Patterson is truly one of the best writers that just keet you coming back wanting more!"
1,Irritated Eyes,"I just bought this eye pencil and to the contrary it irritated my eyes. Maybe because my Almay Amazing Lasting 16 Hour Eye Pencil ingredients do not match the description of the pencil at this store:ALMAY PURE INGREDIENTS: CYCLOMETHICONE, TRIMETHYL-SILOXYSILICATE, OZOKERITE, POLYETHYLENE, PHENYL TRIMETHICONE, EUPHORBIA CERIFERA (CANDELILLA) WAX, LECITHIN, TOCOPHEROL, ASCORBYL PALMITATE, SORBIC ACID, CITRIC ACID, METHYLPARABEN, PROPYLPARABENMAY CONTAIN: IRON OXIDES, TITANIUM DIOXIDE, FERRIC FERROCYANIDE, ULTRAMARINES. 13613After researching these ingredients I found out at Household Products Database that PROPYLPARABEN ""HAS BEEN NOTED TO BE MODERATELY IRRITATING TO THE EYE."" So watch the ingredients to make sure you buy the non-irritating eye pencil. I'm still searching for it."
3,An Interesting and Sometimes Enjoyable Read,"What starts out as a father's love, contempt and obligation to family turns into a son's love and contempt. The father I enjoyed, the son not so much. Early in the story the writing is done in a way that can be frustrating in its repetition, but at the same time artistic in its desciptive style of prose. In describing Bandini's heckling enemy of a house and his ""black bear of a stove,"" the author is at his best.In sticking with reading ""Wait Until Spring, Bandini,"" which I did consider putting down half way through, I felt slightly rewarded with the total book. It's an okay read."
4,Great description of city poor,"I thought he described with insight the inner thoughts of city poor people. Almost thought he could have been one until I read his bio. I was a bit dissapointed with the ending (SPOILER) when his rich lover suddendly announced ""you people are animals."" I didn't get her sudden switch. Seemed too convienent, like he didn't know how to end it...unless I missed something."
3,Colorado Italians,"Being 1/2 Italian and a native of Seattle, it's nice to find a novel about Italian Americans that doesn't take place in some big eastern city. Here the Bildungsroman takes place in Boulder, Colorado; disguised by the author as ""Rocklin"". Some of the usual stereotypes: Bandini's father screams at him over the dinner table. Not particularly memorable as a novel, but worthwhile reading due to its setting."
5,"A mirror lying in Colorado's snow, revealing the earth","The forever memorable phrase "" Rose, I love you.."", with its context.. A sharp, realistic, emotion-full, picture of Fante's soul, one I would pretty much like to walk by his side on a saturday morning to speak of nothing at all, and just enjoy his being near."
4,kelly artigas,very good product and the timely arrival original recommend everyone buy the product to enjoy a good piece to wear thanks greetings
5,Nice Watch,This is a very nice watch and my daughter loves it! This watch is stylish and rugged. Too many feature to mention and they all work as advertised. Can't go wrong with this one.
3,Baby-G Pink Jelly Watch,"I really like this watch. The plastic band can make your wrist sweaty, so I loosen it one notch.UPDATE: 2 years later: Still like the watch; however, dirt/debris gets under some of the clear plastic pieces and (so far) are difficult/impossible to clean. Unfortunately, it leaves the watch looking dingy and I only wear it for exercise, yard work, etc."
5,Fantastic!!,I needed a watch with a stopwatch built in to help me keep track of my times. I'm running a half-marathon in December. This watch has been fabulous!! I love the color and the features that are built into the watch. I have a 16 month old niece and everytime she sees it I have to put it on her. I'm thinking of getting her one as well (except cheaper of course). This watch is amazing and so worth the price. I can't wait to show it off at the marathon!! YOU WILL LOVE THIS WATCH!!
3,Attractive watch but alarm function is lacking!,"I purchased this watch for my wife primarily because it had an hourly signal which she wanted. The watch is very attractive and she loves the way it looks. The main problem with the watch is that the hourly signal and the alarm signal are both so low (lack of volume) that you can't hear them unless the watch is next to your ear. Consequently, the watch doesn't really serve her primary purpose. Decided to keep it any way after further research into hourly signal watches. It seems as though they all have the same problem, a very quite alarm/hourly signal."
5,"Redeems the term ""empowerment""","Empowerment -- is there a word that has been more over used and less informative in recent memory? (Oh well, probably. But you take my point.)David Emerald's book redeems the word by presenting an elegant, intelligent alternative to the well known ""Drama Triangle."" Emerald does not minimize the challenges of shifting from the victim/persecutor/rescuer roles to the creator/challenger/coach roles of TED*; however, for those with the maturity to identify and wrestle with the obstacles along the way, TED* offers a way out.I'll be giving this book to my clients for a long time to come."
5,The Power of T.E.D.,"This is a book you'll retrun to often. A great gift for someone who needs a nudge out of being a victim. This story and its message is simple, clear, digestable and memorable. If you are ready to break free of the drama triangle and hang up co-dependency once and for all, give this a read. As one who teaches leadership for women ready for empowerment, I use this easy to understand model and refer this book often. For sure, an enchanting 'thumbs-up'."
1,The Power of Ted,"Our boss assigned the senior staff to read and discuss The Power of TED. Except for the boss, all of us found the book to be extremely disappointing. We had been given to understand that this would be a moving and powerful book. What we found instead was a grossly maudlin tale, told in a painfully dramatic and somewhat immature style.The guidance offered is little more than common sense, fancied up with acronyms and diagrams. Our recommendation is that you give this book to only those people you wish to torture."
3,Uninspired insights & awkward writing,"Although this book had a useful message -- getting out of the victim role and seeing one's responsibility in creating each event in one's life -- the poor writing and overall lack of complexity and content contributed to a very disappointing reading experience.The dialogue format should have encouraged the reader's identification with the main character, but it was very hard to achieve a willing suspension of disbelief between the awkward writing and the obvious contrivance of the omniscient ""TED"" character.I must confess that I only persevered halfway through the book before giving up as a matter of aesthetic principle. If you have even a moderately sophisticated understanding of relationship dynamics and intersubjectivity, you will find this book well below your level."
3,Ouch!,"These heels hurt! They were perfect for my Halloween Barbie costume but not very useful afterwards. Plus, they kill and I wear heels a lot."
3,Worked at first,"This ashtray worked fine at first. After a couple of weeks, something starting reeking in my pocket and it took me all day to figure out it was this ash tray."
3,very small,"I ordered this as a gift.... I knew it would be small, but NOT as small as it is..not even sure it will hold one butt"
1,"Different emblem, fell off anyway!!","This is a cool idea done badly! It came with a dumb flower on the front - yeah just what my boyfriend did NOT want to carry around, but the ugly thing fell off on the first day anyway!!"
4,Makes a great carrying case for pills...,"I don't smoke, so I do not use this as an ashtray.Instead I use it to carry various medicinal pills in my pocket... and have been carrying it for several months now.Works great... IF you add some cotton to the end near the opening so you can get the pills out easily.The problem with this is trying to easily identify the top so the contents don't spill out when you open it should you hold it horizontally... so I marked the horizontal top with bright orange nail polish.I usually keep this along with a small pen, pocket knife, and lip balm in a small zippered leather case that fits easily in my pocket."
1,mal vendedor,hoy 18/01/2013 no ha llegado le producto y dice que la entrega es el 17/01/2013 es decir va un dia de mas y nada uqe se mueve! irresponsabilidad del vendedor se llama eso no lo recomiendo!
2,Zippo pocket ashtray,"While convenient, it is difficult to clean since the spring doesn't work and the top is impossible to remove."
3,"Sturdy, Sleek, Made in China?","I would give this a full star rating if it weren't for the fact that it was made in China. Now I have many products that are in China and I have actually bought directly from Chinese sellers...but Zippo is known for their American made products! It's kind of frustrating that they couldn't employ some Americans to make this. It is already expensive...but I would gladly pay $5 more for an American made version. The reason being I expect more from Zippo. I want more with what I pay for, I want quality. Although the design is neat, looks like it is used for what it needs to be (in all honesty it's not me that will be using it), I am upset with the fact that it is made in China. Come on Zippo, get back to the program."
5,Easy to use,"I travel a lot and many cities have restrictive smoking laws.Smoking outside is bad enough and I hate to throw the cigarette butt in the street so this is perfect. It is small, works well by just pulling and using the capsule-like device. It has a big enough inner surface (I think it is aluminum and sturdy enough. Once done smoking just crush the cigarette out and the butt goes down to the chamber. This is a very useful and handy product."
1,Its called a garlic press not a garlic masher,"A garlic press shouldn't come with instructions, but for this - I wish I had one. Now, I've never owned a garlic press. I've seen enough on tv to know what one should look like. Never have I seen one that comes in two pieces. Why? Why would you want to have the teeth as a separate piece? If you ever loose it, you're screwed. Also, instead of crushing garlic, it mashes garlic on one side and causes garlic bits to get stuck on the teeth. Save yourself the trouble and pass this one by."
2,For the devoted fan,"This film is for fans of the genre and the Tarzan star, Johnny Weismuller. He gets to wrestle and kill a crocidle in this one too!I watched it because I'm a big David Janssen fan and he had a small uncredited part near the beginning of the film. He was probably 13 or 14 years old at the time."
1,You can get the information for free on the Internet!,"Don't spend your money! There is absolutely no depth to ""The Guide to Owning a Beagle,"" which focuses solely on the good points of the breed and hawking ""Nylabones."" (Andrew Vallilla mentioned Nylabones so often, I wondered if he got a kickback for each time he mentioned the brand.) Here's an example of the information contained in the book. My wonderful beagle-mix puppy is pretty rambunctious and I was hoping to find information on the specific training needs of beagles. I got a ""training"" section that told me I could get a private trainer, join an obedience class or read a book. That's it! Nothing more! So use your search engine and get this depth of information for yourself!"
1,Same for all other breeds,"If you were to buy 'The guide to owning a Shetland Sheepdog' or 'Bulldog' or 'Staffordshire Bull Terrier' or 'any other breed under the sun' by the same author, you will get exactly the same book, just with different pictures. The only other difference would be the very brief introduction to the breed in the begining and the standard for the breed, everything else is identical. He even says that the Beagle excels at obediance, (ha, ha) Need I say more."
3,Offers a very nice history of Beagles,"As the proud owner of two Beagles, 1 field and 1 show, I found this book interesting. It is full of history and facts, and complete with pictures of mostly gorgeous show quality Beagles. I disagree with the reviewer who said Beagles are not good in obedience. They are not generally as eager to please as a Labrador might be BUT if you know how to motivate a Beagle (treats & play) they learn quickly and never forget anything.This is a nice book for a first time Beagle owner and while it may not be the best of books on Beagles it is a nice introduction to the merry little hounds with excellent photographs."
1,AN AD FOR NYLABONES,"I agree with the reviewer who noted that this book was little more than an infomercial for Nylabones. This book had no depth and offered no real information about the care, breeding and history of this unique breed. Instead of focusing on beagles, the owner describes a beagle mix. I admit I was a little dismayed that the book did not focus exclusively on the pure beagle. People who own pure beagles or folks who are considering becoming owners of beagles would find more information in any of a number of books on the subject or by traveling on the internet. This book really offers no information and its ""bark"" is worse than its ""bite."""
5,Greatest product since sliced bread!,"In my opinion No flush Niacin, when taken properly, is just as effective as rx valium or xanax, no kidding! There are so many benefits for your mind & body when taking this product. I really like that I can get pure Niacin from a trusted company w/o the worry of my system being flushed. The vegetarian capsules are perfect for me as I avoid gelatin, (made from cow hooves), as much as possible. :)"
4,Sprig Hinge,Product did not come with any instruction of how to adjust or what tool was needed to adjust product.
4,Hallucinogenic Audio,"Helios Creed was/is a trailblazer into unexplored territories of psychedelic/industrial/space rock. He's painfully underrated among guitar innovators. These two albums, lovingly packaged together, will make a fine companion for your interstellar travels. This is some seriously inspired and groovy stuff here, even with an 80's type of pop sheen on a bit of it. My favorites are Unhuman Condition (so psychedelic it hurts!), Showdown, Cookie Jar, Who Cares."
2,This movie is so bad and never will never see a day for a perfect copy,"Two stars because this was Jesus Franco's worse movie and Grindhouse Zombie-ploitation movie. You wonder why this got such a crappy release and no improvement done to the film well that is simply easy because it was so bad no one really cares to improve the picture quality. I never loled so hard at the terrible transfer of this film, you would think the studio who had balls to even to release on DVD would try to improve something but nah, obviously it was released by some 2 cent studio. I would say watch it to see one of the many Grindhouse movies that was so bad that for some reason it was entertaining and the transfer I am talking about is from Around The World Film release. Oh yes even the prime streaming version by Synergy Ent. is terrible (well pretty much most of Synergy Ent. release are just VHS copies transferred to DVD with no improvements). So watch this movie for the LOL."
4,"Simple, Simple, Simple","This book should be called the Simple Savings System. I was really afraid of learning how to manage my money, but this book helped me understand where all my money was going. I had no idea I was spending so much on movies, books, and eating out...wow! Anyway, this book helped me get back on track. I actually have saved over $5,000 in the first 10 months. The book is simple and fun to use. I will be sending a copy to all my friends this Christmas."
4,Easy to use and has saved my marriage,"I was having a lot of problems with my spouse in the money department of our marriage. This book helped us get in control of our spending habits by helping us set a savings goal for each month and managing how we were doing each week. At the end of the month when we hit our savings goal, we celebrtated with a fun dinner out. To hit your monthly savings goal is very rewarding! Thanks Apple Pie Savings System"
4,"Some good, some just ok","My far and away favourite track is 'My Life'. I keep returning to this again and again. The other tracks are ok, but don't seem to get me in quite the same spot. The recording from a technical side is also very well done. A good one to have in your collection."
1,do not buy any cd from 42nd street music,"42nd street music listed the billy joel sacd they sold me as brand new but when it showed up, there was no shrink wrap on it and there were smudges, scratches, stress marks and even finger prints on the cd cover and the cd disc. It was as if they expected me to somehow overlook all those obvious signs and think of it as brand new when it is not.I was very insulted by them and they refused to refund me for the cd or send me a new one. the cd i ordered is a SACD which was exactly what I wanted but of course without all the marks and scratches that came with it.buyer beware!!!"
2,Rock Or Not Rock?,"Billy Joel sounds great to middle aged women and lovelorn agnsty preteens, but his shtick gets old pretty fast. Critics have suggested that Joel is not rock, and while this is not true, his debt to the Brill building is obvious. It's easy to imagine his songs being the basis for a snappy Broadway musical. I admit that I was a fan back in my own misspent youth, given as I was to soggy sentimentality, but unlike Billy, I grew up. You will too. Till then, you will probably love this album."
5,"""52nd Street"" is a great album","""52nd Street"" was released in 1978. Billy Joel is continuing his great song-writing with a jazzy twist on this album. From the intiminating yelling in ""Big Shot"" to the xylophone in ""Rosalinda's Eyes"" to the jazzy voice in ""52nd Street"", this album is a wonderful voicy jazz masterpiece."
5,Billy Joel's Great Pop/Jazz Fusion Album,"Although ""52nd Street"" wasn't as popular as ""The Stranger"" or ""Glass Houses"", this is undoubtedly Joel's most intriguing album, artistically speaking. Here Joel does a splendid job melding jazz with pop and rock and roll, producing such impressive songs as ""Stilleto"", ""Rosalinda's Eyes"" and ""Big Shot"". Of his early albums, this is my favorite, since it was such a dramatic departure for him from his pop and rock and roll background. Those unfamiliar with Joel's music should acquire this album. It certainly should be regarded as one of his definitive recordings."
4,"Jazzy, one of his best","Showing his versatility, this is a jazzy little number with some great vocals.Until The Night is magnificent and brooding."
5,"Definitely a BJ ""must have"" -- ""watershed"" early work!!","This album is, without a doubt, some of the Billy Joel's most revealing early work. It's incredibly creative. What a showcase of his incredible ingenuity and musical skill! I consider this album a cornerstone/""must have""."
5,One of Billy Joel's Best,"This album, along with The Stranger, is in my opinion, Billy Joel's best work. When I first purchased it in the 70s, I was in high school, and liked it because it was ""New York"" music. My favorites are the beautiful ""Until the Night"", and ""Rosalinda's Eyes"".If you are a fan of Billy Joel, or if you just like well composed music, you should own this."
1,Where did this cat come from?,"A friend of mine handed this over and said you have never heard a guy play a guitar like this. I scoffed and said ""Whatever"", then I almost wore out the disc. My god, who is this guy?, Where has he been?. His playing rivals any electric rock god in the past 15-20 years, he does Van Halen style riffs with bluesy twists, then throttles back to a slow hand ala Clapton.And he does it all on an acoustic!Why this man is not more of a major star is beyond me. BUY THIS DISC.In a world saturated with Britney, Jessica, American Idol, and MTV garbage, real music like this cuts through all that, and makes listening a pleasure."
4,"Nice, comfortable, plain polo.","It's simply a nice, comfortable, plain polo. It fits a little wide for skinny guys, but the 50/50 composition is like silk. I bought the light blue and the dark green, and I wear them often. Great buy for the price."
4,Just what I wanted...,"I'll give these shirts a solid 4 stars. For the price, you can't go wrong. I had been buying/wearing the 5.11 type polos but didn't like how weighty they were, these are a bit thinner and more comfortable. Fit is good, sleeves are a little tight around the armband (could just be the guns! haha) but over all I love them so much I ordered 3 more in different colors."
3,sports shirt,Compared prices at other stores and this was the cheapest and the quality was good. Got a good deal for the quality. Nice fabric.
5,GOOD SHIRT,THIS IS A GOOD PRODUCT. IT WAS PURCHASED AS PART OF A MEDICAL UNIFORM FOR MY SON WHO IS IN MEDICAL SCHOOL. HE SAYS IT IS COOL AND COMFORTABLE.
2,Not what I ordered,I ordered this product with pocket. Received it without pocket. The product is of good quality and I will keep it anyway.
2,Ugh... her tone of voice,"I gave the CD several tries just in case it was my mood or mental state but nope, this woman's tone of voice is condescending. There were times that I actually opened my eyes and looked down at which ever body part she was referring to because her tone of voice made me think I was doing it wrong. In order for a guided meditation to be effective for me, the speaker must have a calm, soothing voice and an even tone. This woman would say something like ""just let it go"" and the vision I would get would be her standing over me trying to pry and yank ""it"" out of my hands. I want to visualize ""it"" floating quietly away. Because I didn't care for the CD I merely flipped thru the book. It all comes in a nice box with pockets for the CD and some little study cards."
5,nothing better,"i was very pleased with this book and have read many books on this subject, i actually wish i would have read this first!!!"
5,Good read....clear and interesting.,"Couldn't put it down. It is a sturdy book with CDs and cards with to remind you of the teachings, etc. All in a sturdy gift-box. Love it, and it would make a great gift. Nice quality and clearly explains meditation for the layman using language appropriate to the teachings but not out of my reach as a beginner. Short personal anecdotes from the authors give the book authenticity."
4,Insight Meditation,"I haven't worked through the entire book, but like what I've read so far. The guided meditations on CD are very helpful, as well."
1,worst meditation guide.,"Meditation guides are obnoxiuosly incomprehensible to follow practically. Save your money, this is the worst meditation guide I have ever come across, there are much better ones out there."
5,Wanna get enlightened? Start here!,"You really gotta have a practice you follow to begin to get liberated. Sharon Salzberg and Joseph Goldstein are terrific guides to help you along this path of liberation. This Meditation Kit is a great way to start. Heck, even experienced meditators would get a lot out of it. Insight (Vipassana) Meditation is elegant in it's simplicity, yet remarkably adaptable to whatever spiritual tradition you follow. And, Sharon Salzberg has a complete guide here, with an excellent workbook and very helpful CD's. Of course, it is Buddhist in it's language and approach yet it's very understandable. One word of caution, though. Once you begin to practice using this guide you will end up spending more money............ you will go out and buy a few more books by Sharon Salzberg because you will like her that much!"
3,Average meditation CDs,"I liked the packaging very much. the book was somewhat helpful, but not as informative as I had expected. The meditations were pretty much relaxation exercises, although helpful. All in all, a pretty nice package, but a bit dissapointing."
5,Great guide for meditation,"This is a clear and well written guide to Insight Meditation practice. I was surprised as rather than presenting the same directions so many other books give, this book will lead you into deeper aspects of the Practice. It is not only a book for the beginner. The cards and the meditations on CD round out this offering beautifully. The book is printed on glossy stock, a rarety in this cost reduction age where so many keepable books are printed on something akin to newspaper with the same yellowing qualities.This is an offering worth having."
4,"Well written, quality packaging","Insight Meditation is a decent no-hype introduction to one style of meditation.It would be a good starting point for those who are curious about the practice and benefits of meditation, although there are other good primers out there, including perhaps the granddaddy of them all,How to Meditate: A Guide to Self-Discoveryby Lawrence Leshan.The book very well written, and down to earth, especially those sections authored by Sharon Salzberg. I also think she moderates the exercises on the accompanying cds, and most should find her voice pleasant enough.Though this shouldn't be the deciding factor, the whole product is very nicely packaged for $20 - everything comes in a sturdy storage box and the book is spiral (metal) bound, so it lays flat."
5,How to meditate,"This package with book, cards, and CD is an excellent down-to-earth introduction to the practice of meditation. It is the best I have found yet. I particularly like the first meditation lesson on the CD. The package is also a good introduction to the most basic teachings of buddhism about ethics (no dogmas here!)."
3,A very experimental album,"Like the title says, this album is all about experimenting. Stuff, experiments with electric insterments, Paraphenalia experiments with using the electric guitar, Balck Comedy experiments with time signitures, Country Son experiments with contrasting themes. The results of these experiments are not all that exciting like Kind of Blue's modal experiments. The performing in M.i.t.S. I think is a little too loose and uninspired. You don't that feeling of awe at the end of these pieces like you do with other MD pieces. This album is an interesting transition between the acoustic small bands and the large fusion bands Miles used in his albums afterwards."
2,Pass on this one.,"This is more of a transitional record and it left me wanting more substance. I found most of the material to be forgettable. Sorry for all of you fans of 'electric Miles' (I like some of it too -In A Silent Way for example), but this stuff is just not very compelling. Save your money."
1,Overlooked,"I purchased this CD in the mid 90s. It seemed to me that, as a minor work of art, this CD was destined to go out of print. In addition to Miles In the Sky, I used to worry that Bob Dylan's Street Legal and Van Morrison's Veedon Fleece would go out of print, too. So far these two are still available. Miles in the Sky is edging closer to experiemtal jazz - it's out there, all right, but the instrumentation is still essentially the same as Miles' famous combo groups from the early 60s. He would take out for outer space in the next decade. At the time of this recording he was content just to arc over the jazz world in the sky, like a fireworks display. In that way the music seems idyllic and postmodern."
2,Oh boy what a boring record.,"This is easily one of Miles' least essential efforts. It's clear that he was in a transitional state (his backing group was splintering during these lazy sessions) and the music is just stoned noodling, really. I've played this thing maybe twice, and the 2nd time was just to make sure that it was as bad as I thought it was the first time. It was."
3,Stuck on the pot,"As other reviews have noted, this album is transitional between Miles' pre-fusion phase(s) and the revolutionary 'In a Silent Way'. That's true, but I'm somewhat less ebullient about the effort than most reviewers. Smatterings of things to come are present; the big difference lies in the too fast tempo which Miles later slowed down to great effect in 'Silent Way'. In other words, the album is located in the prior era. This commitment will suit fans of the early Miles but disappoint those who anticipate the later Miles. Actually, I think the most successful material on this album is the early-sounding material. The material that forecasts the future is very static, similar to 'Filles de Kilemanjaro'. The only moment on this record that really enthralls me is about 10 minutes into track 4 where the past and the future enjoy a blissful union. For a few minutes."
4,Apotheosis of T. Williams,"Anthony Williams'propulsive drumming is the centerpiece of this recording, particularly his work on both versions of ""Country Son"", which has resisted induction into the pantheon of Miles compositions, for it being perhaps desultory and a melange of genres. Who cares? Herbie Hancock is particularly funky, auguring his work evidenced in the Warner Bros. collection. And Miles is effective in understated poignancy (again, particularly on ""Country Son""). I've combed the T. Williams archives for evidence of a performance as integrated and polyphonic and powerful as his performance here and in my inexpert opinion his work on MiTS is matchless. He may have played faster, with more technical proficiency or fury subsequently, but he never played better."
4,"Great CD by Miles Davis, modern instruments, ""funky"" grooves","Miles Davis plays pretty modern music, using mostly electric instruments. Even though the tunes are modern and have ""funky"" grooves, the players still have great, ""old styled"" improvisations. Good CD, one of the best of that time."
4,Good but room for improvement,"I currently use this to carry my laptop in a Sealline Urban Backpack when riding my motorcycle. Since the Urban Backpack has no padding, this was recommended.Pros: Quality construction, easy to use, laptop fits nicely in it and feels secure, design seems sound with practical useCons: Padding could be a little thicker, pockets for accessories would be nice, a shoulder strap would be nice considering the price (though there are connection points for one, it is not included)Over all, I am very happy with it."
1,What a joke!,"Same problems as all the others. The rods were not the same length or width, so they did not fit in correctly. This looked like the Leaning Tower of Pisa for many weeks. One night I came home and it had collapsed with all 200+ CDs, DVD's, etc... into a sad pile on the floor. I cannot believe they would actually sell this piece of garbage. I will never purchase another Atlantic product based on this experience. Save your time, effort, and money and buy something better than this."
2,this was nearly worthless without alterations,"i put this thing together, finally, after an hour of struggle. the materials for this included: 2 planks of wood, several long poles. the trick is to lay 1 plank down, push all of the poles into the slots on the plank, and then put the other plank on top. this doesnt work. once this piece of garbage was FINALLY assembled, according to instructions, i loaded it with my dvd collection. after, i dont know, 20 minutes, i hear a massive crash and entered the living room to discover 5 thousand dollars worth of electronic entertainment laying in a heap on the floor, mingled with 2 planks of wood and 16 wooden poles.it works fine now, after my friend and i constructed supports for the dvd rack. without the supports, this miserable thing collapsed. would i buy this again? definitely not. would i suggest it to someone else to purchase? never."
1,Save your money and buy a real storage,"I bought this for my dvds and these are the worst storage rack ever! Do not buy this, stay away from this. The rods are super cheap and they are not all the same length and not even straight. It makes it almost impossible to put this together without being so unstable. Please take my opinion and save your money and buy something better that uses shelves rather than these cheap rods, you'll be sorry."
5,LILLA BELLE TAKES THE CAKE,"""Lilla Belle"" takes the cake, and the ice cream, too. This book tops my list. It is an unforgettable classic."
5,A FAMILY'S DREAM,"This book is a family's dream. Everyone needs to read this brilliantly written chapter book. Of course, simply reading Miss Cole's words aren't enough, we need to act on them. As a parent,I was elated to read this heartwarming book, that's so inspiring!"
5,GOOD GIRLS FINISH FIRST,"Who says that good girls finish last? Lilla Belle proved them wrong. This beautiful little girl has a heart as big as Texas. Cole's writing is intelligent, humorous, unique and gripping."
5,WEEPING IN TEXAS,"I ALWAYS FELT THAT I'M NOT A CRY BABY, BUT I WAS WRONG, DEAD WRONG. I CRIED, AND LAUGHED AND CRIED SOME MORE. THIS IS AN EXCEPTIONAL BOOK. IT'S THE BEST BOOK I'VE READ IN YEARS. JUST TOUCHES YOUR SOUL,AND MAKES YOU LOVE YOUR KIDS EVEN MORE. GOD BLESS,MICHELLE."
5,A FIVE STAR BOOK!!,I HAVE SHARED LILLA BELLE THE FIRST STAGES WITH EVERYONE THAT I KNOW! THIS BOOK IS TRULY UNFORGETTABLE! COLE'S WRITING IS GENIUS AS SHE SPEAKS TO PARENTS AND CHILDREN! MICHELLE COLE BLINDS THE COMPETITION! THERE IS SOMETHING IN THIS BOOK FOR EVERYONE! LILLA BELLE THE FIRST STAGES DOES NOT DISAPPOINT! THE STORY IS ALMOST AS BEAUTIFUL AS THE AUTHOR! I LOOK FORWARD TO READING MORE BOOKS BY ONE OF LITERARY'S BRIGHTEST STARS!
5,FIVE STARS! LILLA BELLE SHINES BRIGHT!,"I had the pleasure of joining a few hundred people today, in Malibu, to celebrate the birthday of this beautiful and enormously-gifted author! It was truly a pleasure to meet the woman who I have admired since reading, ""Lilla Belle the First Stages."" ""Lilla Belle"" stirred my heart, like few books that I have read. I laughed, cried, and it made me think. This is a glue-book. Once I started reading ""Lilla Belle,"" I couldn't put it down. I can't wait to read Ms. Cole's latest, ""F.A.T. CHANCE."" Hats off to you, Ms. Cole! Happy Birthday, and keep bringin' the hits. Thank you for autographing ""Lilla Belle"" and ""F.A.T. CHANCE."" And thank you for sharing your talent. You are a class act. You are one in a MILLION!"
5,LILLA BELLE! SHE'S A DOLL!,"My wife and I have never laughed and cried so hard! WE don't have any children, but I have shared the book with my neighbor's children, and they went out and bought copies of Lilla Belle for themselves! This book is much needed medicine for today's world!Especially for our children!!!"
5,IN A CLASS ALL BY ITSELF!,"Lilla Belle the First Stages is an unforgettable book that you will always love and cherish! The characters are very memorable, too. But the positive and inspiring messages really hit home! Not to mention the fact that it definitely tugs at the heart strings! I LOVE IT! I LOVE IT! I've read it five times already! It's a book that the entire family will enjoy! Mine certainly did! WeNew Yorkers are known for our toughness. If this book can make it in N.Y., as it is showing that it CAN, it can make it ANYWHERE!"
1,Linked to a book that it isn't,"I bought this book because a book called Selections from Plato linked to it. The other book was the Greek text, and since this was linked and advertised as a version of that book, I assumed that they were the same book. They were not. This is only English text. Complete waste of money."
4,534,"This was the first release from Rocafella/Def Jam under the Carter administration and they came out with all guns blazing. The first track from the album reinstates Bleek as the young gun under Hova's wing and assures all doubters that he hasn't lost his agressive flow over quality Rocafella beats. Later on in the album Bleek supplies us with introspective tracks combing over the events of the last couple of years of his life including ""Straight Path"" and ""All About Me"". Other stand out cuts include Jay-Z's ""Dear Summer"" Hova's love letter breaking it off with his beloved and starting his new relationship with corprate america; ""Like That"" provides a scorching beat from Swizz Beats with an addictive hook from Memphis but it just seems to fall short of that one hit that Bleek needs to crossover. It is a quality album though that ensures him he is one step closer to really Coming of Age"
1,SUCKS,This cd sucks he will always be 1 hit away but like Jay-z says he will always be rich as long as he alive and if he dies he will be ni his will so he can chill somewhere so i guess he dont need to make good shit
5,Bleek Bringing Heat,"Bleek does a great job on this CD. Hov's Dear Summer is a great interlude and First, Last & Only is a banger. Great job from Rocafella."
2,sucks,i mean he did rep but i didnt like the cd it sucked i recomend you not to waste your money bye ying yang twins new one
4,please read my review i got hip hop knowledge,"First let me say, I never really felt bleek enough to say that album is hot, hes had his cuts the put him on but not a solid album that made him look mature, you can see bleeks maturity in this album...he grown now, if you a commercial boy who liked bleeks old stuff...dont buy this album, if I could choose a phrase for this album it would be ""this is for the intelligent and the grown folks, I downloaded this whole album and please believe i will buy 2 copies to give the man props..I wont even make a track list of what I think, take a chance this time, he came hard, ghetto, real, and soulfull, if u a commercial eminem, 50 fan, dont buy this...like I told my peoples this one is REALLY for the hood"
3,its satisfactory its ok i guess,"this album is not as good as MADE. MADE was better but there is some good tracks on here. my favorite tracks are: 534, straight path, all about me, and youre the one featuring rihanna."
4,Memphis bleeks by,"Memphis Bleek blinks by with 4 out of 5. Good track are Dear Summer Jay-Z,First, Last and Only - M.O.P.,Get Low and Livin' Proof."
5,Bleek!,"I'm not under 13 years old but i love this album! Bleek has a great flow on the songs and i like every song on this album espically Like That which i play all the time..and also songs like Straight Path..he gives u everything u want on a album on this one...club songs, feel good songs, street songs and songs about his personal life..534 is a great album..everybody needs to stop dissin bleek because u just jealous cuz hes makin millions a dollers while u don't make crap-Stop Hatin and speakin of a hatin bleek has a song about dissin haters on this album so stop hatin and pick up Bleeks other 3 albums becuz there worth it..memphis bleek is my favorite rapper and i'm not sayin the album is good becuz of that.. cuz if it sucked i would say so..but this album is hot..buy 534 and while ur at it get Coming Of Age, The Understanding and M.A.D.E. becuz there all good..i play them all the time..big up to Bleek keep makin that bangin music"
4,good album,534 was a great album from memphis bleek. that had songs that were as good as his prior albums. so if you like rap you must buy this album.
5,Brooklyn STAND UP!,All I gotta say is Brooklyn STAND UP! Bleek is back and this is another hot album from him. You gotta buy 10 copies cuz this truly is a banger! Roc-A-Fella is coming back strong.... Throw Dem Diamonds Up!
2,Bleek needs to stop!,"Rocafella has truly fell off. I've never really been a Bleek fan but this has to be Bleek's worst album. I did not think he can do worse than MADE but it looks like I was wrong! NEwayz if I were you i wouldn't even take my time to listen to the album if it weren't for one song ""Dear Summer"" and Bleeks not even on it just Hov."
1,working with Jay Z aka Lay Z brings you down,gotta give Jay Z. aka Lay Z His due when you work with Him things really mainly get boring in a Hurry.Memphs Bleek is just a Lay Z sidekick who doesn't have much going for Him with his flow&style. this album project seems like a Tax right-Off more than anything. very Boring&Bland to me.
2,Memphis Bleek Or Memphis Bland!???,"I read the reviews on this website before i purchased the cd, according to them it's a 5 star album. Don't be fooled... I must not of liked it bevcause i am not from new york. Nope thats not it this album is generic and bleek doesn't have that much talent. DOn't get me wrong there are a few alright tracks like Dear Summer ,534, and alright. But those are the select few. All this excuse for a hip hop artist does is drop jigga's name into the mix. Get your own skill better yet do us all a favor only put 3 songs on your next album and put jay-z on all of em."
3,A suprise,"After Meph Bleeks other albums i was expecting this one to flop just like th others. however i heard about the Jay-Z song on it so i went and tried it out anyways. Im glas i did too. this CD is filled with hot beats. Songs like ""534"", ""Infatuated"", ""Alright"", ""all About Me', and ""Straight Path"" show signs of Memph living up to his rep. however there is some filler which is easily skipped. Most of the guest appearances are pointless and add nothing to the CD. However Jay-Z's song ""Dear Summer"" is an instant classic. its good to hear Jigga rhyme again. If your a Roc fan you should cop this CD."
5,HE'S BACK,"the best song is INFATUATED cauz the beat is just classic..and all the other songs were banging too, but it definitely needs mo' tracks.....but still i love the track infatuated and it was probably produced by IRV GOTTI(THA BEST PRODUCER, AND WAY BETTER THAN DR DRE)cauz memphis in the song says ""crackhouse"", where ja rule records his songs...and other good song in this album is the jay-z track........"
2,What a waste of good money,"I bought this album back in the summer thinking it'd probaly be a hot ablum because, of the somewhat hype they did have around it and the singles they had out ( Dear Summer and Like That). I was soo Wrong I should've listened to Games 300 bars and realized that Memphis wasn't anything special. Nah, he's not that bad but, I've heard way better. Maybe since he knew Jay from the beginning Jay felt sorry for him and had to put him on the label. Other then that... there's only one song that I've listened to over and over again and that's Dear Summer which has Jay on the track. It's pretty sad the only song I like has a featured artist on the cd. Don't waste your money on this get it bootlegged or download it. I'm being nice giving him 2 stars because, he's been in the game for a while..."
5,Obsession,"I am so happy with my purchase. I actually was looking for the lotion and I stumbled on the body wash, which I didn't even know existed, since I hadn't seen it at any store. The price was great and it arrived a lot quicker than I expected."
3,Vintage,"Lighthearted, predictable, but entirely enjoyabe. Zazu Pitts is the glue that holds a good deal of the premise together. This is a film that epitomizes the productions of it's time."
3,Icebreaker (before they went international?),"Good album, a little repetitive for me, not as good as the icebreaker international/Manual stuff, but not terrible either.I think listening to samples is probably more effective than reading reviews if your goal is to determine weather or not you will enjoy listening to it, don't you?"
1,For sado-masochists only,"My God! This book is impossible to read; Hobbes' style of writing is ridiculously long winded and very difficult to understand. While I understand and appreciate that this book is one of the fundamental books of modern society, I can't like it because it is so hard to read. Locke I understand, Machiavelli I understand, but Hobbes is tough. I'm no genius, but I'm no idiot either, and I don't think reading one book should consume months of my life. Unless you have to read this, do yourself a favor and avoid it. For sado-masochists only. Seriously."
2,difficult read,I find the book very challenging to read and comprehend. Have picked it up numerous times and put it down before too long. Change your diet to increase your IQ by 50 points before attempting.
1,What a pile of garbage!,"It was akin to someone projectile vomiting every tidbit of thought or knowledge they'd accumulated during their entire life. To make matters worse, the entire work appears to fall under the logical fallacy of contraposition, that is he bases all of his arguments on the held axioms of religion therefore who cares what he then extrapolated as the foundation of the argument was false."
5,This book should be read by young people,A classic is a classic!Today young people should read it to stop all the abuses of the Police State.
5,Good buy,If you are into political theory this is a good book and you already know that! The book was defiantly bigger than what I expected and is broken down into three sections.
3,Not going to comment on the contents,"I'm not going to comment on the contents of this book, but I will say that the combination of the binding and the cut of the paper is rather low quality. The blades that cut the paper were clearly not sufficiently sharp, and so the book came with uneven pages. Really unfortunate."
2,Retains antique spelling,"Leviathan is, of course, a classic so I won't waste words on its merits. The issue is this edition. This version retains the original spelling. If you are Ok with this then it would probably be OK for you. If not, not. I'd prefer a more scholarly edition with an introduction decent footnotes as, I suspect, would the average reader."
3,Recommended Reading for GOV 101,"Hobbes, Locke and some guy with a name like Machiavelli (or some such) were to the Framers what the Framers were to today's legislators - relatively God-like. Thy were often cited in the debates over the drafting of the US Constitution.Levitation is Hobbes's signature work.The first half of the book is a study of where the authority to govern comes from, and what a legislature and an executive are. But then it gets interest in as the whole rest of the book is about reconciling religion with government, saying that no man should be legally bound by the religious visions of another."
3,difficult to read,the essence of Hobbes critical thinking and evaluation is commendable except that the book is extremely difficult to read because it is in Old English. As a result I only read a couple of chapters that really interested me. I feel its effectiveness would be greatly increased if someone would render the text into modern English and republish.
3,A good dictionary of political thought,"This is an excellent book on political thought and if one is interested in the philosophy of government, it is a must read along with Rossaeu Social contract. However, as many people do not know, this book is written in the style of a dictionary of government, in which a word is used and defined. The next sentence is the definition of another word. There are no long passages and it can be a little disjointed to the modern reader. However, it still is useful as many people misquote from this book, and argue that the great thinker Hobbes supported beliefs which are diametrically opposed to his actual philosophy. If one does not know the ""great authors"", one is tricked into following demigoiges and false messaiahs."
4,www.sportofdistraction.com,"Although I personally do not agree with the philsophies delivered within Leviathan, this is a must read for those interested in understanding modern-day political culture.Other authors which should be studied alongside Hobbes for the same purpose as that which is stated above would be, Locke, Macchiavelli, and Adam Smith. Developing an understanding, however hard it will be to sift through this antiquated version of English, is essential to the blossoming citizen of the state."
2,Not my cup of tea,I have serious issues getting past the misspellings and the psychotic notions of Hobbes (or the translator's doing as far as spelling is concern). It is most nonsensical in the 1st part of the book and the religiousity is driving me crazy as I force myself to continue reading ... and to think I have to write an essay on this book. Yipes!
1,Poor edition,This book uses very poor paper and has a poor printing. The binding is so bad that it hardly unfolds. This book can only be used as a text for students.
5,definitive edition of this work,"Leviathan is a the most exiting work of political philosophy I have ever read. You may disagree with it, but you should read it anyway and recognize its significance in the history of ideas.This edition is a good one. Its pages are thin enough for ink to bleed through, but the text itself is definitive and its printing is based on editions from Hobbes' lifetime. Contrary to a prior reader review, this edition DOES have parts three and four, although rarely do those sections get read anymore (the interesting things are in one and two)."
4,This book is thin,"It seems a little dishonest to me for Norton not to reveal on the cover of this book that it is an abridged version. In fact, the only way to know that is to read the footnote in the Table of Contents, or the preface.It happens that, in my view, the Leviathan can use the abridging, and it is very possibly that you think so too. But readers should be told that before they buy. So I am telling you.I'm a bit disappointed with the secondary materials, too, but not quite disappointed enough to grouse about it too much. Still, it seems like the editors could have made up for all those lost pages in the main text to get more ambitious in the secondary materials.I still give it four stars because I like the abridged version."
4,$44.95 is way over priced.,"I purchased this book from a friend for the published price of $14.95 and it's a great value at that price, however the Amazon price of $44.95 is a big rip-off."
5,A very helpful and easy to read book,"This is a great book for parents or caretakers of a toddler. The book is clearly laid out into sections by age (1, 2, and 3), and within each age, there are sections for the different types of development (such as motor, language, emotional). There is a checklist at the end of each section that helps you identify the key skills your child may be working on at different breakouts of time. From an organizational standpoint, this book is excellent.I found the anecdotes and toddler-POV tales very helpful in understanding what is going on in my daughter's world right now. Most of them brought a smile to my face, and occasionally a happy tear as well."
1,Not for me,I was disappointed in this book. I missed in the description that the author uses anecdotes about other children. I don't care for books that are written that way. I don't want stories of others and this book is full of them. I just want straight foward common sense advice. Read descriptions of books very carefully before purchasing.
3,An inside look at adopting from Vietnam,"Tracy Pillow does a pretty good job of involving the reader in each step of their adoption... from first seeing their child in an adoption magazine to traveling to Vietnam, to returning home and the surgeries their daughter needed for her cleft palate. My biggest complaint about this book is the extensive, seemingly random use of italics. Sometimes half a sentence, sometimes a full sentence, sometimes an entire paragraph will be italicized and it really interferes with the flow of the narrative. (Kind of like reading a book that has already been highlighted). But I would recommend this book for anyone interested in adopting from Vietnam and/or adopting a child with cleft lip/palate."
4,Nickel Quilts -a great way to use up your fabric scraps!,I bought this book because my friend had this book and let me look at it. I loved it and had to have it! We were making scrap quilts at the time and I love making scrap quilts so I saw a few quilts that would be easy to make in this wonderful book! Thanks! Now I have to get more scraps!
5,"Nickel Quilts, a delightful book","This is my second Nickel Quilt book. I'm delighted with the patterns. They are easy to follow and fairly quick to make. Several patterns offer a great way to use up scraps from your stash and some are more ""matched"". There is something for everyone in here. An advanced quilter might be bored with it however as there are not many challenges with folds, y seams or curves. Overall I really enjoy owning this book."
5,Great Video,This is an excellent video! The instructor is easy to follow and the content is comprehensive. It's like I got three videos for the price of one when you consider how much I learned and how much information was included in this DVD. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in learning reflexology techniques. You will not be disappointed!
4,Works great.,"Works great and is much less expensive than brass ones. I can't think of ten more words. Works great, should be sufficant."
5,Perfect little easel,I just received my table top easel and I can't wait to use it. It is sturdy and just right for my small house. I paint out of my living room and this will be perfect! Love it so far! Always check the packaging box for the bolts to make sure they didn't slip off during shipping. They aren't tightened for your convenience and one bolt was in the box loose. No problem putting it and the washer back on. It is a great little item!
5,Handy Easel,Nice compact easel for those without a lot of space. Expansion is surprisingly large. Convenient storage for supplies.
4,History the way I like it,"If only history was always as informative and interesting in its presentation. This is a book which not only makes you think, it also makes you smile as well at times. Full of colour and detail on what was a fascinating period of English history. Very well researched. I can really recommend this to anyone looking for information or simply for a good read."
2,NOT what the doctor ordered!,"Liza Picard's book on mid-eighteenth century London is essentially for those who like to dip into a topic and have a short attention span. Though long, there is less to it than first meets the eye. This is history-lite and as such would probably have found limited favour with Dr Johnson himself. Ms Picard has used some interesting material from medical sources of the day but her reliance on The Gentleman's Magazine as a source shows in the notes at the end of the book. There is little attempt to relate all this detail to the actual events of the times, so the reader is left with a far from balanced picture of what mid-eighteenth century London was really like."
2,Love Johnson? Keep looking,"A good source for minute information, this book functions better as a reference book than a comprehensive take on 18th century London. Readers should be advised that the first few chapters are heavy on the development of bridges and neighborhoods and such, yet there are no accompanying maps. If you are good at picturing how one lane leads into another and so on, this will be a delight. I found it extremely frustrating.The other immediate and annoying aspect is that, as other reviewers have correctly noted, Ms. Parks is no Johnsonian. Those who unluckily appreciate the Life do not understand his conversation for what it was - ""bad manners."" I feel that she uses his name to sell a work that could otherwise stand on its own. (Or maybe as ""Horace Walpole's London."") In any case, those expecting to find the comfort and familiar parlance of the big guy are going to be sorely wanting, as I was, for the late, great Mary Hyde."
1,Couldn't even finish it,"I read the back of this book, and thought, ""what a cool idea for a book"". Then started trying to actually read the book, and the execution just didn't live up to the idea. I got through about a third of the novel and then just returned it to the library. The main characters are unlikable and boring, and most of the first part of the book is the heroine's internal dialog. Didn't even care how this one ended - I just wanted a truck to hit them and put everyone out of their misery."
4,Good enough,"This is far from a perfect set, but there are very few choices out there like it if you are searching for a historically accurate set of early man. These are Neanderthal, not Cro Magnon (both live during the Ice Age). The animals are too small in comparison to the humans. There are 3 men, 1 woman and no children. They seem a bit scantily clothed for cold weather. The humans in this Wild Safari set are larger than is found in Safari Toob sets and the plastic is more flexible. Comparing these with some Safari sets, the Safari sets seem more detailed. I haven't yet received the Safari Prehistoric Toob set yet so I can't make a direct comparison.This isn't perfect, but these two sets are all I can find when it comes to prehistoric humans. Other sets do silly things like include dinosaurs (which did not live at the same time as humans)."
5,Vintage Miles,"Most of the reviewer's have said all there is to say. These are great compositions and the alternate takes add so much to the interest of the listener. The comparisons are endless. One note to a potential buyer: Listen to the second alternate take of hand Jive, a take that is mesmerizing and much better than the final cut. Miles has a glaring note mistake at the end and a rhythm error following that which causes him to say ""Damn!"" in his raspy voice. If not for his mistake, the world would have heard that great take instead of what they got instead. Another note: One has to listen in awe of Tony Williams on this album. He truly was a master of the drums and shows the whole creative arsenal, especially in Pinnochio and hand jive (alt take 2). Enjoy."
5,One of Miles' BEST!,This album is so haunting. Most (all?) of the songs were written by Wayne Shorter and they all naturally reflect his intensity. The interaction among all of the players is incredible. They play as one. Definitely one of this quintets best. As beautiful as the cover photo of Miles!
2,Great live album but not the best of all-time!,"Joel's talent came along way as a major singer, songwriter when he went on tour in the soviet union russia. Kohuept the album showcases his fine performances. Joel sings his greatest hits songs like ""Honesty"", ""Allentown"", ""An Innocent Man"", ""Uptown Girl"" and also ""Big Shot"". But this CD has it's moments not so much to demonstrate Billy Joel's live concert musical masterpiece work included instead of it right here!"
3,"Kontsyert is a decent album, but not Billy Joel's best","<rant> Before I get into my review, I must say I'm shocked to see the album title mangled like that(Kohuept is WAY off base). The album title translates phonetically as ""Kontsyert"" (spelled Ka-o-en-tse-ie-er-te). The Cyrillic alphabet is written and pronounced unlike English. </rant> This album was significant when it was originally released - the USSR was starting to see signs of rebellion, and Billy Joel's music spoke to the young working-class both here (in the States) and in Russia. To buy it today, though? Only if you are a true fan of his music. If you're looking for a better taste, his Greatest Hits albums (1 & 2) are better, and cover some of the same tracks."
3,"Good Songs, but Not Best Live Concert","This will probably be the only Billy Joel album I will give lower than 4 stars. The songs are nice, but they vary so much from the studio albums, and Billy sounds like he's singing some of the songs like he coulnd't care what they sound like. ""Only the Good Die Young"" and ""Uptown Girl"" are examples of this. ""Baby Grand"" performed by himself doesn't sound right, and his Ray Charles impression is not that good. The song is not good anyways. Some songs, such as ""Goodnight Saigon"", ""Sometimes a Fantasy"", and ""Honesty"" save this album from getting lower.If you want a live album, get Billy's MSG concert on New Year's Eve 2000. It's much better, trust me."
3,"An interesting premise, but runs out of steam","I enjoyed the beginning of the book and was intrigued by Jennifer's staged crime. She seems to gain the attention she wanted but guilt soon consumes her. Most of the book after that seems to drag on. Several supporting characters offer sympathy to Jennifer, but not much happens to let us get to know these people very well. I agree with Horn Book's review that the characters are too sketchily drawn to care much about them or their motivations. I was hoping for a more emotionally charged novel but it seems to go flat in the middle and gets annoying at the end. What should have been an emotionally suspenseful ending just didn't tug at my emotions. I give Rundown three stars for it's strong beginning and interesting conflict, but it it got tired quickly. Needs Wheaties."
3,Boring...and amazing.,"There were times when I really loved this book, and there were other where it was just too boring. Rundown is an ok book with a great premise behind it. If more if it appealed to me, I'd rate it higher. Also, the ending was terrible. Its still something that doesn't set right with me. It makes no sense.This one had the chance to be amazing...but it just didn't work out."
2,disappointing,"The concept of this book was interesting, and the beginning of it had potential, but towards the middle and definitely the end were disappointing. The ending made no sense, and the middle had little to do with the beginning and was uninteresting. The plot was unusual and could have been a much better story if written differently."
3,"interesting set-up, but....","another book that was on my required reading list for school. it centers around jennifer thayer, daughter of two newly well-off parents who seem to care alot....about jennifer's older ""perfect"" sister. to get attention, jennifer fakes being assaulted, which brings on many more emotions then jennifer counted on. at first, i found the fast-moving action exciting, and the set-up promising. i even could identify with jennifer at some points. then, however, the story hit a point where i just didn't care anymore. to many side-plots that went nowhere were annoying. not the best book i've read, but not the worst."
5,Nice quality,"Seems to be a nice quality set. Nothing on the box indicates the country of origin, though the chain links are stamped USA. I'll assume the gears are made here too but I'm not positive. A very decent looking chain and gear set with the added benefit over a stock chain of having 3 timing index positions and being roller link."
2,Not very good,Sound quality was very dissapointing. Sounded tinny with a fair amount of interference even when only a few meters from the main unit. And that is in a house with no wireless phones or internet. I doubt I'm ever going to use it.
2,Not so hot,"Setup was easy enough, but the sound quality just doesn't work for me. The sound is sometimes ok, but sometimes garbled. This is in the living room about 50 - 60' from the main system. In the kitchen, maybe 15-20' from the main system, it's just fine - but I got it for the living room. Has to go back."
4,What is art? What is commerce? Who decides?,"As questions go, these are good ones: What is art? What is commerce? Who decides?In ""Bluebeard,"" Kurt Vonnegut grapples with those questions alongside a handful of other humdingers: Who am I to think I have anything of importance to offer the world? Do I have talent? Who really knows? Who really cares?Here he answers, while telling the life story of abstract expressionist Rabo Karabekian: An artist must try to both define and uplift humanity. Start with whatever God gives, then never stop learning or trying, even after public failure. Somebody out there recognizes art when it bites them on the butt, and, finally, the artist cares. That's what he or she does.Yes, the world will put a dollar value on it, call the creator a genius, a fraud or a clown. But the artist must create and release that work to the world, whatever the cost.Is Vonnegut funny, sad and insightful here? As always. You bet. Put your money on him.Is this his best work? You be the judge."
5,One of the best books I've ever read.,"One of Vonnegut's best!! I found myself continuously having to remind myself that Rabo Karabekian (main character) was indeed a fictional character. How does he do it? How does Vonnegut become the ""soul"" of an Armenian-American artist without exagerating or fabricating specific cultural traits and values that are particular to the Armenian people. A story with no shortcomings, and an ending that sugar-coats the entire experience."
2,I don't understand the hype,"I am a lukewarm Vonnegut fan. There are some of his books I enjoy (though there has never been one that I've ""loved"") and some that bore me to death. This one was OK for the 1st half. Though a bit tedious, it had it's moments. But after some time I became bored and couldn't bring myself to trudge through to the end. The characters were very annoying (especially the female one) and pretentious and I couldn't relate to all the angst and incessant belly-aching.To sum it up: A big bore."
3,It's Vonnegut... but:,"I read Breakfast of Champions first, and I have to say that I find this work much more subdued and 'unengaging' in a way -- not for lack of philosophy, but because KV seems to be holding back his personality a bit. Maybe it's the device of him telling the whole story as Rabo writing an autobiography, but it feels like we are not getting Rabo but just a rather muted Kurt. The book is still brimming with things to consider and excellent peeks at the human experience, but you can't help but notice that the sparkle is a wee bit damp here, although still a sparkle."
4,a good book with lots of character,This book was a wonderful satirical look into how foolish and trivial people can really be- Zen Master T
1,Horrid documentary,"A ""documentary"" created by a believer who questions anyone and anything except his view of Christianity. It's like asking a fundamentalist southern baptist to actually be openminded to existentialism , just ain't honna happen. I'd give it 0 stars if I could. 3bucks wasted. A better documentary is ""the god who wasn't there"". My theology professor, Dr Robert Price, is one of many who give a honest view into the life of jesus."
3,Pretty Good for Light Reading,"This book is fun and basically informative, but notice I used the word ""fun"". For a more educated or deeper look into the subject, find another book. The stories in this book seem to be synopsis, however very good ones. They gave me just enough information for me to want to look up books on specific sunjects, and not enough to satisfy me on any one."
5,This was one of the best liners I've ...,This was one of the best liners I've used in a long time. It went on smoothly and stayed on all day. It didn't smudge and still looked fresh after wearing it all day long. I find that most products will smudge after a few hours. I usually use Lancome and this product is just as good at 1/4 of the price.
5,I liked using this eyeliner. I usually like ...,"I liked using this eyeliner. I usually like the Almay product line. The eyeliner went on very smoothly without out tugging on my skin. This to me is a big plus. Many pencils that I've used in the past pull on the skin and don't come out even. The color was good and it lasted a long time. I didn't have any problems removing the eyeliner with regular soap and water. I didn't need to use a makeup remover to wash it off, even though it probably would've come off easier if I had. I will buy this pencil."
4,I was very happy with the product and ...,I was very happy with the product and would recommend it to anyone looking for eyeliner.
5,Worked perfectly.,"Not much to say about a spark plug. It worked perfectly in my lawn mower, no complaints at all. It took a minute to gap it and install it."
5,Spark plugs are the heartbeat of your engine,If you have Honda powered lawn and garden equipment and like to do your own maintenance then you're likely to become very familiar with this spark plug. I like having consumables for my small engines on the shelf in my garage and since I have 4 or 5 Honda powered pieces of equipment I usually have 2 or 3 of these plugs on the shelf. It's nice that Honda uses the same plug on several different sizes of engines.
1,BAD,Britney's version of I love Rock 'N Roll was absolutely horrible. That's all there is to say. Joan Jett did it waaay better.
1,Not a good cover.,"While Britney's cover of the Rolling Stones' Can't Get No Satisfaction came off pretty good with her reinterpretation, this song is SPECIFICALLY Rock 'n' Roll. The title sets the parameters in how this song must be performed. The song is about Rock 'n'Roll and therefore should sound like...well...Rock 'n'Roll! Unfortunately, Britney's version misses the mark miserably.Furthermore, I do not think Spears could not have performed this song as Rock 'n' Roll without it sounding cheesy. Perhaps she could have, but I think it would have took a monumental effort because she is pop. As it is, this is a pop song about Rock 'n' Roll but if you - the singer - love Rock 'n' Roll you - the singer - should be singing it. This is not to say that Britney does not love Rock 'n' Roll. It's just that she does not convincingly pay homage to the genre with this cover."
1,Makes a fool out of herself....,"Yes, this is the same Britney Spears that recently made a fool of herself at the MTV awards show where she did not dance well, she dubbed the singing when she was not really singing, and actually stopped performing before the number was over. Her good looks are not getting her anywhere anymore and now she may be heading for a big fall, the kind where you do not get up again."
4,I liked it,"I really did like the film though the characterization of the girlfriend and Vin Diesel aren't as strong as their personalities make their roles seem. Ribisi as always is really good, his ability to be both canny and wounded seems to be his best twist and at the same time, you can see a thoughtful character at work. The question of if Ribisi stays a small time illegal game promoter is morally equal to being a stock broker who sells things that don't exist, isn't as sanguine as the film would like it to be. The judgmental hand of the gov't federal agents turning him into a stool pidgeon seems a bit too contrived and happens too out of the blue.Ben Affleck makes a nice appearance and the way the director uses innocent young faces within the context of such a intelligent, engrossing film that makes you want more of the characters at the end. And thats the mark of a great film."
4,Rent it. Buy it.,"I really enjoyed this film. Giovanni Ribisi is brilliant along with the rest of the cast. The film is carefully crafted with a sort of Rounders flavor (another great film). In addition to the great characters, I connected with the theme of a wayward son seeking a tough father's approval. While you may be put off by the number of f-bombs in the film (this one really ups the number from Beverly Hills Cop, a very mainstream film with a huge number of f-bombs) stay with the film and give yourself time to make sense of the story and connect with the characters. The Boiler Room delivers a very satisfying movie experience. Rent it. Watch it. Buy it. Watch it.Boiler RoomBoiler Room (2000) (Blu-Ray) [Blu-ray]Rounders (Collector's Edition)Rounders 10th Anniversary (1998) [Blu-ray]"
4,boiling heat,"sorta has the ring Wall Street did and it echoes threw here. The Cast is splendid, you got Vin Diesel(Pitch Black), Giovanni Ribisi(suburbia), Nia Long(Soul Food), Nicky Katt(suburbia), Jamie Kennedy(Bait) and Ben Affleck(DareDevil). the story does well in this one and the ending is nicely done"
3,Extremely obvious.,Although Ribisi's character if fairly well developed the rest of the players are more like charicatures than real people. But I have to add that I loved Ben Afleck as the companies training officer. The film could have benefited more from his presence on screen.To compare this film to Wall Street is like comparing Al Bundy's high school football exploits to Emmit Smith. They each may have had similar goals but only 1 reached them.Just doesn't really work.
2,It's been done before...,"Correct me if i'm wrong but doesn't the movie movie seem to more than ' borrow ' from "" Wall Street "" ? An investment advisor moving up the ranks and getting a crisis of conscience from a deal gone wrong, while conveniently getting his dad in the fix at the same time. Hello ?!?! It seems that the homage to Stone's far more superior flick in a scene in the Boiler Room tries to conceal this. Rent Wall Street again if you don't believe me."
3,Didn't Anyone Else Notice.......,"O.K. I admit that I picked this up because Vin Diesel's in it and surprisingly I found it very interesting. I especially liked the characters portrayed by Vin Diesel and Ben Affleck. I have noticed that this movie received a lot of negative reviews but I'm surprised that no one as far as I can see has mentioned how sexist it is. The only two female employees of the firm were secretaries, they had no female clients because as they phrased it ""female clients can be a pain in the ass"" calling all the time fretting about what their stock IS or ISN'T doing, oh and the worst part of all.....under the deleted scenes there is one entitled ""The Hotel Room"" which is not only borderline pornagraphic, but portrays two prostitues being used in the most offensive of ways. It's a shame because personally I enjoyed it as much as Wall Street, but it was sexist, vulgar and offensive at times."
2,Go teen!,"""Cruel Intentions"" as teen's ""Les Liaisons Dangereuses"", ""Boiler Room"" as teen's ""Wall Street""... If you make those kind of re-makes have it done at least as ""10 things about you"". ;-))) P.S. I am ready for more ""interpreteens"". Go teen! I love ""Opposite sex""."
3,Generation X's WALL STREET,As I watched BOILER ROOM I kept thinking about the 80s movie WALL STREET. The plots were incredibly simular. I prefered the movie WALL STREET over BOILER ROOM but both were good.Both movies show the coruption and greed that can be found in stock trading. Both movies show how youth can easily be caught up in the lure of big money at any cost. Also both movies show how greed and going against your conscience will lead to nothing but trouble.
3,what happened to the ending?,"The film, probably not intensionally, is a good morality play concerning the negative effects of greed and the moral choices we must make. Affleck is not on the screen long at all, unlike the trailors. Everyone puts in a fine performance. And the plot and pacing of the film are wonderful. I'm getting into the film and getting interested in what's happening and then suddenly...the film just abruptly ends. It was like they ran out of film so they just put up the credits. Did they run out of money to shoot the film? I don't understand. There is more story to tell, but not enough to force a sequel."
2,Not too enjoyable,"In between the Rap soundtrack, the warmed over storyline and predictable plot - there wasnt much to enjoy here. I have to say I am very unimpressed with these actors, Ribisi, Diesel and Affleck - Affleck especially trying to reprise the role of Alec Baldwin from Glengarry Glenn Ross, frankly he would be scarier reading his lines in a dress. Wall Street is a far superior film - while it is given ""homage"", it basically says a lot that the best scene is when the actors are repeating Michael Douglas's lines while watching the movie on TV."
2,Not what I thought it would be.,"I was really disappointed in this movie. I didn't think that Vin Diesel was in it enough to be called a ""Vin Diesel"" movie."
2,Mostly interesting for its flaws,"This is a poorly written, badly directed film that is nevertheless entertaining for two reasons: you will keep asking yourself ""where have I seen this guy before?"" and it's the type of bad movie that is fun to analyze to understand its flaws."
4,"""A Sale is Made on EVERY Call You Make!""","Giovanni Ribisi is Seth Davis, a 19-year-old who's secretly running a backdoor casino while his parents think he's in college. Desperate for a quick buck, he joins JT Marlin, a brokerage firm that has the look, feel, and energy of a Morgan Stanley or Smith Barney. But underneath the gloss, this is a firm that engages in shady dealings, selling fake stocks and ripping off investors cold. Seth learns the ropes of the trade and over time becomes ruthless and cocky. He alienates his no-nonsense dad, who happens to be a judge and is, to say the least, disappointed that his son is blowing off college.On the surface, this sounds like a re-telling of ""Wall Street,"" but don't dismiss this film so easily. ""Boiler Room"" soars on the strength of performances of Nicky Katt, Scott Caan (son of James), Nia Long, and the then-unknown Vin Diesel. The film moves at a brisk pace and, for the most part, avoids melodrama and other formulaic touches. Definitely worth a look."
3,Worst commentary ever!,"I love the extra features on DVDs, especially the commentaries, but this one is just painful. They clearly had nothing to say, but felt compelled to babble aimlessly....""you know""...""or whatever"". They made a decent movie. I may even watch it again, but that commentary has to be the all time worst!"
3,First Half is Terrific and Entertaining,"BOILER ROOM (2000) * * 1/2 Would-be hot shot college dropout gets a job in a ""boiler room"", where fast-talking salesman sell mostly worthless stocks to gullible phone customers. Worth seeing overall thanks to a good cast of young actors (Giovanni Ribisi, Ben Affleck, Scott Caan, Vin Diesel, Nia Long and more). The first hour is terrific and entertaining, but the less interesting and believable subplots take over in the second half. It's never boring, just disappointing that a movie that started off so energetic and engrossing lost its way in the last 45 minutes or so."
3,not bad,Not too bad of a movie but at times boring and the execution of the good ideas were not brilliant. Does a good job of showing the criminal activities that go on every day on Wall Street in one form or another.
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Though I'm still not sure the scenes with Ron Rifkin as Ribisi's father really work, the rest of this film is a gripping look inside a shady stock firm that seems all the more relevant these days; with powerful performances by an almost entirely young cast, Boiler Room is an interesting and fast-moving thriller."
4,A updated version of Wall Street,Boiler Room in my opinion is like a twenty first century Wall Street. Giovanni Ribbisi is in his Charlie Sheen mood in the lead role while in a small part Ben Affleck is kind of like the Micheal Douglas character. Vin Diesel gave one of his first lead hollywood dramtaic performances roles in this movie and I wish he would return to those. Also look for the sexy Nia Long as Ribbisi's love interest . A great debut from director Ben Younger who needs to be given more work in Hollywood.
5,A Modern Day Wall Street,"What Wall Street did for the '80s, Boiler Room did for the 90's. With its wonderful cast and side plots, Boiler Room showed the shady world of the flourishing chop shops during the 90's boom. The father/son relationship Seth has is heart-wrenching as is the Abby's home situation. Many lessons are to be learned through this film. For one, regardless of how shady a company is, there do exist some people in these firms who either don't know what is going on or who really have no other choice. Secondly, stop worrying about trying to impress others (even family) it just may get you into trouble."
1,wall street for dummies,"As a trader myself this movie is an insult to the finance industry if its objective was to portray it.This movie borrows its concepts from the false impression that trading is all about extremely ruthless hungry young college drop outs who are going to be ""millionaires in 3 years exactly after the day they start"" yeah right....Furthurmore, it is full of unidimensional characters who are portrayed as greedy, ruthless and violent.This dvd maybe mildly amusing to those whose knowledge of the industry is minimal...but please, making those silly references to Wall St by means of taking off lines from Gordon Gekko is cheesy and outdated....The whole idea of how the brokers make money in this movie is a joke...it involves cold calling small investors and selling them shares that arent listed yet....(would anyone actually fall for that? paleez)whats more? hows this for dialogue..""sell 20 shares"" (customer)""your done"" (broker)hello, dosent the customer want to know the price???"
5,A very entertaining look into wall street sleaze,"One of the classic Wall Street films, especially fun with the indie edge and Ben Affleck and Van Diesel making early appearances. Even though the film centers around a small scam-stock selling firm, recent revelations about the big Wall Street firms selling crap they are simultaneously shorting for their own accounts tell us it's the rule rather than the exception these days. The scammers love living high on the hog while destroying the unsuspecting investors."
4,Positive Transaction,"Everything about this transaction was positive! Price was good, shipping was fast. It was nice getting a digital version of this neo-classic movie.... an alternative to the 1985 classic Walstreet with a more modern feel."
4,don't compare this movie to wall street,"I think the BIGGEST mistake people make about this film is they expect a 'gen x' version of the film Wall Street. Well, don't.This film stands by itsself. Its not meant to be a remake of 'Wall Street.' They are both about the stock market, yes. They are both about ruthless yuppies, sure. But the similarities stop there.Boiler Room is a drama/suspense/mystery film. Its about the classic story of a son willing to do ANYTHING to prove himself to his father. Its never dull, it always keeps you guessing, and its got a 'real world' feel to it.So, again, watch this film like you would watch any other film. Don't try to hold it to the standard of 'Wall Street'. If you let the movie stand on its own, you'll be able to appeciate it!"
2,Did Not Work!,"I have been looking for this DVD for so long and received it as promised (love Amazon Prime!). As soon as I found in on my door step, I opened it and put it in my XBOX. The product did not work. I tried it in two other players and my computer with no luck.I immediately put it back in the box and shipped it back.I would give the seller (Not from Amazon) a 1 star rating but I will give Amazon a 5 Star Rating for their customer service and prompt return of my money. They were not able to exchange the item but I had the cost of the DVD back in my account within 2 weeks.Thanks Amazon!"
3,Boiler room,"Boiler room is a decent attempt at morphing the themes of Wallstreet and Glengarry Glen Ross, and even though it is inferior to both, it still manages to give a good view inside a sales driven culture of boiler room."
4,An awesome movie,Boiler room is a very interesting movie about a topic that seems like it is very possibly going on all the time. Giovanni Ribisi is convincing as a genious who keeps making the wrong choices. Other strong performances by Vin Diesel and Nicky Kaat.
2,Hmmm.,"I'll admit that I was entertained, but some of the moments in this movie was just downright goofy! I found the scene where the guys were all huddled together and reciting lines from ""Wall Street"" like toddlers watching ""Barney"" completely lame-brained. I also wished that someone else could have played the role of Seth. Giovanni was particularly hard to watch with a straight face as he whined and sniveled during the climax of the film. His presence alone cause the two star rating on my review. Other than those major drawbacks, the suspense will keep you interested all the way to the end."
2,Made Redundant by Glengarry Glen Ross,"Much better than I expected it would be. Kind of an update of ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" with stockbrokers instead of real estate salesmen but without the drama or tension. I don't know. This movie is so good in so many ways but so bad in so many others. I think the recent stock market mania is a topic that should be depicted in a movie but maybe Stone's ""Wall Street"" and Mamet's ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" have made any future movies about greed derivative and trite. And it's a real shame that the film didn't explore more fully the co-opting of hip-hop culture by these white yuppie-wanna-bes."
4,Pop Songcraft - 1997 Style,"If you believe pop song-stylings went out with grunge, this CD will change your mind. The songs are crisp and full of hooks, certainly in the tradition of Prefab Sprout, Burt Bacharach, etc. Only trouble I have is Dominique Durand's voice, which is breathy and off-key - fine for punk singing, but not popsongs. Oh well. That doesn't keep ""The Best Thing"" or ""Quick, Painless, and Easy"" from settling in your head. Not arty, not groudbreaking, but a nice entertaining romp that'll stick to your ribs."
3,good but not great,"This is breezy, over produced pop power/pop music. The singer has a unique voice which does make the songs sound interesting but it also casts a similar sound for all of the songs.One thing this is not is an extention of ""Fountains of Wayne"".This is a good cd with a lot of quality songs. Most of the tunes have an upbeat, happy vibe.My favorite song is ""Baker"" since it is the most distinguishable song. It is slow tempo with a very beautiful horn riff that practically serves as the chorus. ""Ba Ba Ba"" is the hardest rocker and has almost a Car's feel to it. Very new wavish!""The Best thing"" ""I've got a feeling"" ""This is the day"" and ""I get the message"" are highlights.This is a good work but cannot be considered a masterpiece. Every song is a 3 minute, wispy, breezy song with the French-accented lyrics.When I first got it I did listeneto it a lot but I have not placed it into my cd player in a about 4-5 years.When a greatest hits compilation comes out, it will be worth getting."
5,Great Pop Album,"I am in love with Dominique Durand's voice. Her soothing, moody vocals blend with the guitars, drums, and occasional horn sections to create some of the greatest pop melodies I have ever heard. Each song is sublime and perfectly crafted, a testament to the great music skills and talents of Adam Schlesinger, Andy Chase, and Dominique Durand. The whole album exhibits a range of moods and styles, from the upbeat ""This Is The Day"" to the mellow ""Ba Ba Ba"". Any fan of pop music should purchase this album - along with Fountains of Wayne (of which Adam Schlesinger is also a member) Ivy is the epitome of pop perfection."
4,Two Words: Adam Schlesinger,"Adam Schlesinger is a busy guy, what with ""Ivy"" on one hand and the wonderful ""Fountains of Wayne"" on the other. The guy's also busy writing catchy songs for films like ""That Thing You Do!"" With Ivy, his bouncy yet, sentimental chord stylings shine through again and are well enforced by Ms. Durand's subtle, ghostly voice."
5,Still Listening Strong!,"This CD is for fans that appreciate fun music with a great female vocalist. I relate this CD to a total milkshake of great Sundays, Cranberries, Saint Etienne, Jonatha Brooke, and Sixpence none the Richer. Take a sip! You'll love it!"
2,Sounds like a hundred other bands out there,"I had heard an early Ivy song called ""Wish it all away"" on a local college radio station, and found it to be a pretty, minimalist tune. The singer had a lovely voice and the song really was bare-boned and charming. Sadly, this record is over produced and their simplistic sound is lost. With the exception of the lovely voice, there is nothing special about this record. They really had potential."
2,These reviews have me puzzled...,"I was a big fand of Schlesinger/Fountains of Wayne, so when this CD first came out (on Atlantic Records, at the time) I was really eager to hear this CD. Needless to say, I really found this monotoned loungish-pop record to be a total disappointment. I had difficulty even getting through the entire disc in one sitting! One word comes to mind: dull. Not recommended!"
3,A VERY NICE APARTMENT,"Buoyant soft indie-rock glides smoothly under the lilting euro-lounge vocals of Dominique Durand, a 90s Claudine Longet-like spoken breath singer. ""Apartment Life"" sounds like a day in one's apartment staring out the window musing about the cat on the sill and the meaning of life. ""Get Out Of The City"" is a catchy pop melody hopefully escaping a stillborn psyche and ""Back In Our Town"" is a haunting three part vocal that adds an ominous tone to this otherwise breezy scene."
5,IVY IS A FANTASTIC PLASTIC SOUL TRANSPORTING AURA OF BLISS,"What more is there to say about this great CD. The tracks are top to bottom the best works of pop music I've ever heard. There is no greater feeling than coming home from a night spent with friends, and curling up with a Mocha in a cup, and Ivy on the player. I especially like the first track ( The Best Thing) and the last track ( Back In Our Town). Within the two tracks is an infinite range of depth and soul that artfully portrays the conflicting emotions of the whole album. The whole disc is a thematic exploration of the elements of having a party combined with the let-down after everyone has left for the evening. Overall it is a sonic revalation of the life of twentysomething America. Music does not define me, but rather serves as a soundtrack to the events of my life that occur when it is around me. This CD has, by virtue of it's timeless take on life become the soundtrack to a good portion of my University existence."
4,Ivy are excellent,"This is the CD that brought Jayson B. and Michelle Allen together, so you know it is good.Long Distance was great too, but that didn't bring Jayson and Michelle together, so it's not as remarkable."
2,what a let down,"the title of this film really caught my eye. i was thinking of two styles of kung-fu (dragon vs vampire) going head to head in a mythic battle. i was instead treated to NO kung-fu.....did i say NO kung-fu. the fighting that was there was weak and under-choreographed and the acting and plot were horrible(which is usually ok if the fighting is good).the film is really about one bad guy who wants this guys Shaolin secret magic, so the magic-guy promises to teach a theif (the main character) his secret. but this ends up being a dead-end beacause the bad guy kills the magic master....oh and there is a vampire lurking around for no reason as well....i dont want to give it all away so go ahead and buy it and see this disappointing film for yourself."
1,Just could not get it to work at all,"I wanted to replace my old and rather flaky foot pump and as my rear drivers side tire had developed an annoyingly slow slow leak I went looking for a more powerful foot pump. The Slime looked like the business and was one of the few twin cylinder pumps available in the US. I read the previous review about the connector, I use foot pumps a lot and I was sure I could get it to work.Sadly I was wrong, I had to pump up a flat last week and despite trying many many times, attaching , unattaching and re-attaching the connector I just could not get any air to go into the tire.Also the connector fits so tightly it is extremely difficult to get on and off, this makes me worry about damaging the tire valve. I hate to give such a bad review to any product and I was very hopefiul about the product and perhaps I just had a bad sample but I would not reccomend this product."
2,Bad connector for a car tire,"As the other two posters have mentioned, the connector is really badly designed. Basically the stem is too short so that you have to fight to get the connector onto the valve. For some reason you also have to fight to get the wretched thing off. Having managed to connect it, then you need to apply your full weight (in my case 155 pounds) to inflate the tire - which happens at a snail's pace. All in all I'm not impressed. I've used foot pumps for over 15 years and I've never had so much trouble- even from the cheap $6 pumps. True they only last a year, but I'd expect something much better for a $30 pump."
3,Godd affordable pump,"I have found this pump very handy to have in your car. I used it essentially when I need to add more air in my tires. So far the experience has been really positive. You can rely on the gauge. It seems a little hard to pump but hey ""No pain no gain..."". For the price and this is an excellent pump and the quality seems to be very good (surprisingly)... :)"
4,"It's so cheap, adding a real air chuck won't hurt?",Seems like the pump is good and the air chuck is bad...So just replace it with a clamp-on air-chuck #6140A61from McMaster/Carr. Fixes it right up and the air chuckwill prob'ly out last -you- let alone the pump? ;)Update:While fixing bicycle tires the kids tried using it andstepped on the gauge which bent the manifold and thatcaused it to leak at both cylinders. Hadn't figured outa way to repair it at this point. :/Up until then pump and especially the new clamp-on airchuck worked great! No kidding. :)I'm buying another and keeping this one away from myfavorite mocosos. ;)(my first review)Alvin in AZ
1,Quantum Microscope,"The item was received and appeared to be in good condition. However, when I tried to use it all I saw was shadows and then the light source stopped working. The idea behind this product is great but it's durability is poor."
1,not great,"I purchased two of these microscopes for my classroom. They look nice, have big screens, and several lenses with which to magnify, but the light source is awful. I had to turn all the lights in the room off and close the blinds in the windows just to see a shadowy image on the screen. Yes, it does magnify and do the job as a microscope, but it would be nice to see the image on the screen more clearly. I also purchased the ac adapters to power the microscope, but now wish I had saved my money and not purchased any of it. My students were so excited to use the microscopes, but we were all disappointed with the quality of the images on the screen. This may be great to play with at home, but as a classroom tool, it was terrible."
1,junk,"Didn't work, it was if i was spraying alcohol. As soon as i would spay it the product would evaporate on the surface. paint came right off of it just the same as if i wasn't using it. Another sales gimmick that does not work"
5,Best mat for the money,"Since learning Thai massage, I was searching for an affordable/comfortable mat. I was glad I found one with the Shiatsu/Thai mat. It's light enough for me to carry, thick enough to feel comfortable on any floor and well under 200.00 dollars. Thanks a lot guys. Keep up the good job. Namaste."
3,Better Be Better,"I hope for better plot development, smoother dialogue, and deeper character insight. The ""reunion"" and the mastadon in the lab give me hope that the wit and verve are back. I'm pleased that Caroline has a larger role this season. Every workplace needs a no-nonsense conscience to cut to the chase and keep things focused. Wendell, representing the working class hero, brings ""Bones"" back to earth and in touch with the rest of us. Baby Hodgins, a mere glimmer in the writer's eye ""7 months ago"" is this season's clock.Let's hope the writers regain the confidence and balance they displayed during the first two seasons. C'mon, people. Let's wrap this series up and send it into syndication with a flourish. Okay? No more two-dimensional Bones. Try to remember all the progress she made during earlier seasons and credit her with more emotional maturity and cultural literacy. Otherwise, how are you gonna explain the eventual . . . okay, I don't want to spoil the surprise."
5,Fantastic,This series never fails to disappoint!! A perfect choice for anyone who enjoys forensic shows like CSI or NCIS. I watches the whole season in one weekend marathon session....i couldn't get enough!!
5,I have to have it!,"Although there has been some ups and downs (""The Finder"" episode is the lowest in the entire TV show history)in this season, Bones hasn't lose the sparkle that makes it the best show on TV. Only the episode about the deaf-mute girl makes you feel the great and satisfying experience that is watching this TV Show."
5,The Sixth Season of Bones,Excellent...entertaining...great series! I would recommend this Season to anyone...I enjoy the actors and their chemistry...always look forward to the next episode.
1,Bones Season 6,This product appears to be a counterfeit. The labeling and packaging are not standard. One of the disks skips. I would not order from this vendor again.
2,"Pregancy and ""luv"" take over a good police drama","I have enjoyed Bones from the git-go, for its sometimes-gritty subject matter, interesting police procedural depictions, and the byplay between the main characters. However, in the sixth season, the series has become a soap opera about relationships, pregancies, and cutesy people occasionally interrupted by the cases. I'm outta here!"
1,I Give Upl Husband Gave Up the Week Before,"After seeing the first episode of this season, my husband said he was giving up on the show. He absolutely loved the first four seasons but he couldn't take any more of this touchy feely unrequited love stuff for another season, like he did with season five. I gave it till to the second episode to improve but it got worse. What was once a very funny show with Bones and Booth has become as funny as the proverbial heart attack. Even the serious aspects to this CSI but anthropology drama show are now taking a back seat to their love lives. Angela and Hodgkins are so sappy about being in love and expecting that every moment they are onscreen verges on embarrassing. Bones and Booth are now dealing with his new girlfriend but it is plain to see that they are both still in the throes of unrequited love. Again. There is barely any screen time to handle the case by the time we endlessly view this tripe. This show has jumped the shark."
1,DVD skips,"The DVD was listed as ""like new"" but the DVD skips and it came in a strange case. The first disc in the case skipped terribly. The first episode played with a few skips, but the second and third episodes were not worth trying to watch. It skipped every 10 seconds. As for the case, it wasn't the orgiinal - it is made of cheaper material, the front cover was taped on, and it holds 8 DVDs, not 6. None of the DVDs fit neatly into the case."
2,poorly written with annoying characters,The writers of this show must be moonlighting from their regular jobs on a soap opera. The characters are so poorly developed they make the Real Housevives seem deep in comparision. The stories are cardboard and the 'science' is about as believable as an episode of The Jetsons. Truly awful and getting worse each season.
5,Great season of Bones!,Purchased from awesome seller! Was only watched like once so was in excellent shape! One of my favorite season of Bones. David and Emily are great at bringing these characters to life. Both are very funny and I could watch them as these characters for a long while.
5,What's not to love?,"This series consistently puts out! Great. If you've never watched this show and are simply looking for advice on tv shows to buy on dvd to watch, you can't go wrong with this one. It has been great from season one until today."
5,Another hit,"I have been a huge fan of Bones for a while now, and this season doesn't disappoint. Following the reunion of the Jeffersonian forensics lab after a brief hiatus, this season treats such issues as the Booth-Bones relationship, Max Keenan, various on-off romances, and the Gravedigger. there are plenty of new, fresh cases to solve. This show is never dull, and always keeps you on edge. I won't say it's one of the best seasons, because they are all so amazing, but I will say it is well worth watching if you are a fan of the show."
4,Bones and Life,Both these dramas are clever and a joy to watch. Can not understand why Life did not continue. Probably did not fit the usual no brainer style of most American shows.
3,Great show,Fast Shipping. I enjoy the show. Would make a great gift. Works great!!! I highly recommend this DVD. You are sure to enjoy
5,Fast and cordial delivery.,The price and delivery is very good. A letter accompanies the item which reminds me of the old days when personable customer service was the norm.
5,bones the complete sixth season,I have been a big fan of bones since it first started. I really enjoyed this season although I would like more episodes per season.
5,Love Love Love this series!,This is a great series and it is so much better on DVD than on TV! I hate commercials and it great to be able to just pop in a disc and relax on the sofa.
3,Losing it,"The mystery portion of the shows are fine. We have the usual high-quality, inventive murder/situation to resolve. However, the personnel development, or is it redevelopment, of the characters is cloying and annoying. It's turning into a real ""chick-flick"" series and not in a good way. Probably no more Bones in our viewing future."
5,Emotionally harrowing,"I did not realize the emotional investment I had in Dr. Brennan remaining rational, logical and unfeeling. The past couple of episodes reinforced these qualities to an almost frustrating level. Well, if anyone wants to know when she is going to FEEL, watch this episode. Her path to tears must be surreal and almost a psychosis so tightly wound she has been to stay in her unemotional bubble. An introduced character plus the entire plot used to reveal her heartfelt qualities are a subtext to the overall theme: Dr. Brennan wakes up to her heart."
5,bones season 6,What can you say the series only gets better.This season was a tear jerker and a breath holder. A must for the Bones Fan.
5,Bones,"The best show on air, great story lines. Loved it. Love the way the cast work together. Hope they keep up thegreat mix between the characters."
3,Hannah has pretty much ruined the series for me,I find her boring and irritating not to mention that Booth is becoming more distant now that the relationship between Booth and Bones has soured the interest of this show has pretty much soured for me. The series is still okay but its not nearly as enjoyable as it once was which is a real shame.
1,SELLER NEVER RESPONDED,"I received order, Bones, The Complete Sixth Season, got to Disc 3, and it would not load. Tried it on several VCR's and got the same DISC ERROR message. I attmepted to contact the Seller on three separate occassions via his email address in the span of three months, and never received a response. THIS IS NOT anywhaere near Seller's service response history, BUT A ONE STAR is my vote. No courtesy of a reply, or any attempt to resolve this issue. DO NOT RECOMOMEND THIS SELLER TO ANYONE!!"
2,Scratched discs,"Received the order with no problems, however, there are several discs that have scratches and will not play in DVD player. DVD players skips through content that then cannot be viewed. This has now happened on three of the discs associated with the season. The item was supposedly brand new, must not have been stored or mailed properly."
5,Bones Used DVD,"Product arrived well before time quoted and in excellent condtion. I was a little apprehensive to order used dvd's, but am very pleased with what I received. No problems with any of the discs and will defintely order from this seller again!"
5,love bones,"Love the show and buy all the seasons when they come out. Amazon has very good prices and also has preordering, which I like. I will keep purchasing from Amazon."
5,Bones!,I love amazon instant video! When I miss an episode of a show I'd rather pay a few bucks than have to hunt it down and worry about viruses!
4,Bones Season 6,Everything was as expected. I had no issues and came very quick. It was a perfect gift for my sister.
1,Not so hot,"I was looking forward to a really good read here, but the book was dull, heavy, and depressing. There was also too much sex for me. A far superior novel on the same subject is YOUNG WILL: THE CONFESSIONS OF WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE, by Bruce Cook, which was lively and interesting. I'd also been planning to read Cowell's MARRYING MOZART, but after reading THE PLAYERS, I decided against it."
5,A writer's writer,"Stephanie Cowell is a wonderful writer: sensual, fresh, original, but most of all inspiring. A writer's writer: no higher praise.Sandra Gulland[...]"
3,Historically detailed dramatization of Shakespeare's life,"Of course the actors and writers went hungry when the City of London shut down theaters to combat periodic outbreaks of The Plague! Again, Stephanie Cowell treats us to such detail in a drama set in her meticulously researched Shakespearean London, this time about the great writer himself, before he became famous.""The Players"" is a good read for lovers of historical fiction and romantic notions, taking stabs at the origin of the sonnets and other aspects of Shakespeare's early life"
5,Rich and enjoyable,"Honestly, I would give this 4.5 stars, but that wasn't an option. . .My family found this DVD to be very enjoyable. Yes, me and my wife and two young girls. In fact, Live in HD is on DVD is about the only option for me with young children -- I can always pause the DVD to explain the plot and read the subtitles for them.The sets and costumes are so good and the camera work is excellent. You often forget you're watching a live stage production instead of a movie.Placido Domingo amazed me. That anyone can sing like that at 69 is astounding. Like another reviewer, I was not so impressed by James Morris.Adrianne Pieczonka was very enjoyable. I didn't hear the flaws that the other reviewer did. Marcello Giordani was excellent. I really enjoyed listening to him.Overall the acting was first rate. I believed the story as it was presented."
2,NB: By comparison,"Domingo's attempts at baritone roles is successful only because, in my opinion, he is an untouchable. People love him and his ventures into the baritone repertoire are celebrated, but he can ONLY be compared to other baritones in the role and as such he fails.Gobbi, Cappuccilli, Milnes, even Hampton, are all better by far. What is depressing is if you really want Simon Boccanegra on DVD you are overwhelmed with Domingo live performances. I do not deny his stature as one of the great 20th Century singers but that should not give him license to do anything without fair criticism.Domingo is not a baritone, and while his stage presence might fill the shoes of Boccanegra, his thin, hollow ""baritone"" voice does not."
5,very good suplement,"hi. this produt and the company, entirelt pets are awsome. the nutri cal is good on my dogs. they love it."
5,This is a book you can't put down.,This book was by all means a gripping one which I didn't put down until the very end.... Maalouf has a sensitive way of producing a combination of romance and reality and one has no way of knowing how much of it is actually contrived...mainly because of Maalouf's convincing. sensitive and confident style. This was a book I really enjoyed reading and I am looking forwarding to reading more of his work.
5,like them,These spark plugs fit many of my small engines.I t sure beat the price at the local hardware store.It sure makes it easy to just react up on my shelf and get a plug.Great deal.
3,"Compared to other Second Great Quintet albums, merely decent","Released in 1966, MILES SMILES was the second album where Miles Davis assembled his Second Great Quintet: pianist Herbie Hancock, bassist Ron Carter, saxophonist and main songwriter Wayne Shorter, and drummer Tony Williams. This ensemble explored a kind of finely crafted modality often called post-bop, which in its elegant flow and smooth edges contrasted strongly with the free jazz movement enjoying its heyday at the same time.I love most of the Second Great Quintet albums, but MILES SMILES leaves me cold. The majority of the songs here are too restrained and low-key. The album unfortunately doesn't sound as good as its predecessor ESP; why is Shorter pushed far to the left? Still, ""Footprints"" is an excellent composition and the playing throughtout is fine. I just desire more variety."
5,MILES BEST RECORDING FROM THE SECOND QUINTET,The Second Quintet went all out in this 1966 recording!It is in my list of his top 5 recordings during his entire career!Miles at his best!!!!!!
1,Not hybrid SACD,"Be warned, this is not a hybrid SACD, it will only play in SACD players. There is a non-SACD version available."
2,Miles smiles,Not one of Miles best albums compared with his classic bebop of 50s & early 60s. Miles bestsidemen from that period were Coltrane Adderly Evans Chambers and Philly Joe Jones.
4,Good Grin,"Miles Davis / Miles Smiles (Columbia Legacy CD): While this is a very entertaining album, it is one I like more than love. I give it Four Stars."
5,The crowning jewel of Miles' second great quintet.,"Well folks, this is about as good as it gets. Here Miles and company (Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter, and Tony Williams) let loose with the furiosity of ""Orbits"" and ""Ginger Bread Boy"" while showing amazing restraint and dynamics on ""Circle"" and ""Footprints"". One of the best recordings of Miles' 50 year career."
4,A final nod to normal,"MS is evocative of Davis at his post-bop peak, chronicling a time right before outer ventures became the rule of the day."
3,Good book ...has info about Ayatollah Khomeini,It is an interesting book with information about the shias in Iran and particularly how the atmosphere was like during the time of Ayatollah Khomeini. I think girls would enjoy this book more than guys because it is written by a female which makes it even more interesting as she writes about her experiance in Iran during the time of the islamic revolution in 1979. I read this book sometime back and i still remember the interesting quote which I read on the first page of this book by Hazrat Ali. It is an interesting read for someone who wants to get a glimpse of the time of the islamic revolution in Iran.
2,"Informative, but very biased.","I have major problems with this book. The author obviously went in with the pinion that women were being mistreated in the Islamic world, a perception she ""supports"" with various unrelated examples. The book is obviously biased toward the author's western viewpoint of the status of women, and she applies her cultural standards to other cultures--something no self-respecting anthropologist (or journalist, in her case) should do.I will say one thing in the book's defense, and it is that through it all, she tries to remind readers that what goes on is some countries is in direct opposition to the example set by the prophet Muhammad. She makes an effort to separate what Islam requires/suggests regarding women, and what certain countries and people do to women in the name of Islam, and for that I thank her. Beyond that, I think this book is the story of an author who went out looking for information to support a theory she had already formed. So much for unbiased journalism."
1,Amazing,"Amazing how these reviews keep changing from one day to the next. Sometimes there are a bunch wiped out (usually 1-Stars) and when someone complains a couple reappear another day. For what it is worth to bother putting in another one, the book lacked validity in any area and seems to be written either by some misinformed, misguided or totally (well I don't want to violate TOS here do I) person. This type of writing belongs in the fiction waste basket prior to getting past some unsuspecting publisher who obviously thought it was worth printing. Kind of goes along with the hate books published by the Christians in accordance with accounts of the Pagans in the early days of this country. A total waste of time and certainly not a believable account of anything the rest of the world knows."
4,Women in Islamic societies,"Nine Parts of Desire is an intelligent book by a curious female journalist who, frustrated at being excluded from regular reporting during a Middle East assignment, instead investigated the lives of Islamic women. This is old-fashioned journalism by a pro, full of insights; she's not trying to make a point, but to describe and analyze what she encounters. It's very readable, and I recommend it highly."
3,"Very biased and skewed, but overall good information","One has to agree that there are inequalities of the sexes within the Muslim and Arab World, as there is everywhere. This book presents some of the information wrong, especially the Quranic and Hadith texts, as well as leaves out other information in the same areas. Although she might quote some of these texts, she takes them out of context which not only changes the meaning, misses the point they were trying to convey in the original context. This book is pretty good if you are already know a good amount of information regarding Islam, women, and multiple views regarding both so you can pick out the flaws and misinformation."
5,Amazing insights to world of Islamic women,Read this some months ago and have just finished Geraldine's Year of Wonders ie 1666 of an English Plague Village. I have read it three times - remarkable and unexpected ending. Worth adding to my bedside table. Her 9 parts of desire is a must for men.Michael S Parer
3,There are better,"I suppose I have read both better and worse books about ""women and Islam"". I suppose I had high hopes for this book, given the general descriptors. My main complaint is that the author presents many heavy handed stereotypes and the standard misinformation, and that is that.Since there are many long reviews of this book, I will simply state that as a parallel format book, Price of Honor will educate those who really desire accurate information more than this book will ever. And by the by, I have TONS of books on the subject!"
3,I suppose it's hard to be completely unbiased,"This truly was a fascinating read and I could not help but appreciate Geraldine Brooks' devotion in her interviews and putting this work together. Written in the 90s (aka pre-9/11 world and view of the Middle East) she tries to figure out the whys between traditions and laws regarding Islamic women. Brooks is a lovely writer and her works paints a vivid image of Iran and other countries, as well as various women she meets. That said... I can't help but consider this a feminist work. Most of Brooks' conclusions dwell on negativity and harshness. Indeed, it's hard for a person to fully understand another mindset and Brooks does her best to be understanding. And good qualities is mentioned.Brooks tries her best to be unbiased, so I guess I can't fault her for that. But maybe an effort to speak of more good would be appreciated."
4,The hidden world of Islamic women,"Geraldine Brooks, who I knew previously for her novels, was also a foreign correspondant for the Wall Street Journal. When her female assistant, who previously painted her nails and talked about dating at the office, decided to don a veil for modesty, Brooks became curious about the role of women in Islam. She discusses Mohammed's experiences with and teachings on women, as well as the modern interpretations of those teachings and what that means for modern women in Islam. This book was obviously written before 9/11, so it's missing some important changes that have happened as a result of the attacks and would be significantly improved if it were updated, but the current text is still very worthwhile for those of us who don't have much knowledge of Islam or its teachings."
1,Transparent prejudice thinly veiled,"It's sad that Geraldine Brooks is unable to veil her dislike of the people - including the women - she writes about. Her very choice of words and the way she describes people - whether they are her personal colleagues or relatives of Khomeini - belie her prejudice, which makes it impossible for her to write anything objective. Good thing another Western women - Elizabeth Fernea -addressed the task in a far more professional manner."
1,"Another misguided view of Arab and Muslim women, BAD BOOK","I do not recomend this book to any one, its too biast and narow minded and lacking the fundamental truth."
2,Disregard this book,"I believe that some of the information is accurate, however, I suggest reading about women in Islam from a Muslim woman. A secular feminist is not going to give the proper picture about a woman in Islam. It is like asking a dog what it is like being a bird. Also, most of her discussion is about ""cultural"" norms. It doesn't relate to Islam at all. I suggest going to Islamic web sites and Islamic bookstores for real answers..."
1,Insensitive and Unaccurate!,"I have just finished reading this book, which I thought would provide me, the Muslim woman,with an insight of literature that was deplicting my role.What I found, infuriated me! As I turned the pages, hoping to find relief with positive portrayals of most Muslim women-I only found more negatively drawn, inclusive interviews that seemed to be the focus of her reporting tactics.What was so 'hidden' about her book was the successful, Muslim women, who were happy and not oppressed!I strongly DON'T RECOMMEND IT!"
2,Disappointing rehash,"I guess it is a good market now for anything about Islam. This is all old news, looks like reworked columns. Not insightful, not fresh, just tired old stuff mainly about middle to upper class women. Save your money."
5,Fascinating read - and not just for women,"Not only did I find this book profoundly interesting and thought-provoking, but so did my fiance and his best friend (also male). None of us could put it down. I'd particularly recommend this book for anyone in a reading club - you should have lots of interesting discussions! An excellent book for anyone with interest in cultures and cross-cultural (mis)communications - and I don't just mean Islamic cultures."
1,JOKE,Obviously this is FICTION ! If it's not then I don't have a clue where this writer came up with all this imaginative speculations. YES VISITOR VISAS? ROFL I am still laughing at that and so much more but laughing only because it is so obvious. Disgusted is what I am at the gall and audacity of the stupidity and ethnocentricity of all of it. It really is quite absurd for any of us who know the truth and I agree that anyone who wants to know the truth should certainly not believe what someone that doesn't seem to have a clue says. But then I am of the mind that the book MUST have been written as some kind of JOKE? Right?
3,nine parts of desire,"one has to be fair while evaulating this book...the kind of treatment towards women that the author depicts is something very real. saddening, yes...but one cannot deny that so called 'muslim' countries today oppress women and infringe on their rights and dignity that are upheld by the Qur'an, the word of Allah. what God has granted us believers, mortals take away from us in the name of religion. that said...the book also has quite a few instances of gross generalization. I didn't see the author make an effort to understand the difference between cultural practices and that which religion truly mandates. to get a better understanding of the status of muslim woman, as the Qur'an present to us, Amina Wadud's 'Qur'an and Woman' is amore suitable book. in closing, I'd like to quote - 'Let there be no compulsion in religion...' (Surat Al-Baqarah-Ayat 256)"
1,Don't waste your money on this extremely weak product,"That previous review can only have been written by a representative of the company. I purchased this product last week at Whole Foods. From the research I did, I knew that TRUE oil of oregano is hot to the taste. So I bit into one of these ""oil of oregano"" capsules, with its thick gelatin lining, and the tiny amount of substance inside tasted entirely like olive oil. Olive oil! It had a slight taste of oregano, but certainly no more than your cooking after you put a dash of the spice into your food. So the lesson: if you want expensive ""OLIVE oil"" capsules, by all means buy these. But if you want ""oregano oil"" capsules, look elsewhere."
2,trying to send back,"I purchased this product for my tv that 'went out.' The lamp replacement was not the problem and so I tried to send the product back, but the resaler never responded to my request to send back and per their info, they have to approve it to be sent back... I now have this product and do not need it, but having problems getting my money back."
4,TurboCad Worth The Money,This program at times is a little hard to figure out sometimes but for the money is well worth it.
3,First Person Account of Delaware's 1st Reg. in Civil War,"For a Delawarean interested in the Civil War, this is a fascinating book.Written by Capt. Seville, who served in the regiment, this book presents a first person account of the 1st Regiment Delaware Volunteers as they participated in some of the great battles in the East such as Fredricksburg, Anteitam, Gettysburg and others. The book relies heavily on regimantal after battle reports, some of which are printed in their entirety.The prose is sparse and the story is sparingly told. Nevertheless, this account of the service of one of the best regiments of the Civil War (which suffered tremendous casualties opposite the Bloody Lane at Anteitam and helped repel Pickett's Charge at Gettysburg) is fascinating."
4,Billy Joel Does It Again,"For Billy Joel fans, The Bridge is a must have album. For music fans, The Bridge is a should have album. For folks who are deaf, you still may want to consider this album! It's that good!!"
4,Best of the Later Years,"I'm not sure why this album has been put down so much. This is easily his best post Glass Houses album. Really, the only week tune on the album is Temptation. His previous three albums had more or less been homages to the Beatles (Glass Houses and the Nylon Curtain) or Doo Wop (An Innocent Man). On the Bridge, he finally starts to develop his own style again, which is honed and well-crafted. As is typical, Joel front loads his album with hits, but outside of the hits there are a couple of gems that you won't want to miss. Running On Ice, Big Man On Mulberry Street, and Getting Close are all great tunes, the latter of which features outstanding hammond organ work by Steve Winwood. Naturally, The Bridge doesn't really rank up there with Joel's 70's work, but if you like albums like An Innocent Man and River of Dreams, you should definitely have this album as well."
5,The most complete Billy Joel album,"I have a comprehensive collection of Billy Joel's fine body of work, but I don't think he was ever able to top this. It is a mature and enthralling collection of songs finer, in my opinion, than any greatest hits collection. There is no better album to get me going, get me happy, get me enjoying myself, get me thoughtful, get me anything."
4,Cross The Bridge,"After he explored the music of youth on an Innocent Man, Billy Joel followed that up with the more modern sounding The Bridge album. This is his first album to featured major collaborations with other artists. ""Baby Grand"" is the most notable of these as it is duet with his idol Ray Charles. The song has a nice, easy going feel to it with the two piano men distinctive voices meshing well. He also joins forces with another piano man, Steve Winwood on the album's closer ""Getting Closer"" and the eccentric Cyndi Lauper on ""Code Of Silence"". ""A Matter Of Trust"" is a strong rocker and along with the big band swing style of the lengthy ""Big Man On Mulberry Street"", stand out as the two best songs on the album. ""Modern Woman"" was originally included on the Ruthless People soundtrack and is an upbeat, fast number. The album's one lowlight is the predictable and insipidly sappy ""This Is The Time"", which has become prom fodder."
4,An ass-kicking album!,"Following the success of GREATEST HITS VOL.1 & VOL. 2 in 1985,the following year saw Billy's next all-original album THE BRIDGE. A MATTER OF TRUST kicks ass big-time! The music video shows Billy and his band performing the song for a crowd surrounding the building in which the performance is taking place. Inside the same building several floors below is a cranky,crabby woman repeatedly yelling ""SHUT UP!"" THIS IS THE TIME tells about memories to look back on in the future. MODERN WOMAN is from the movie ""Ruthless People"" released in 1986 as was this album. BABY GRAND is a duet between Billy and Ray Charles. Guest artists on this album include Cyndi Lauper on CODE OF SILENCE and Steve Winwood playing his Hammond organ on GETTING CLOSER. A MATTER OF TRUST,BABY GRAND and BIG MAN ON MULBERRY STREET are recycled for 1987's KOHUEPT,a live album recorded in Russia when Billy promotes THE BRIDGE. Except on BABY GRAND,there is no Ray Charles,but instead,Billy's band."
4,"Good, but not Great","Of all the Billy Joel albums I own (and I have 10), this by far is his weakest effort. By this, I don't mean the music's bad, it just has the least amount of songs that I would listen to. ""Running on Ice"" is a nice, fast song, and ""This is the Time"" is my favorite-I play it on the piano a lot. ""A Matter of Trust"" is nice; Billy picks up a guitar! ""Modern Woman"" is fast, but then it fizzles out; ""Baby Grand"", even with Ray Charles, is just a ver bland song; ""Big Man on Mulberry Street"" is okay; if I listened to it more I'd probably like it. ""Temptation"" is weepy, willowy song. ""Code of Silence"" is a good song, but Cyndi Lauper's bird-call noises get annoying. ""Getting Closer"" is okay, but not great. It's a mixed bag, simply put."
1,HORRID!,"Call me crazy, but this one really sucked! I have listen to my dad's record version, and only Running On Ice, Matter Of Trust, and This Is The Time are good. This is his worst! The songs aren't as deep as his other songs, and trying to use techno funk music isn't a great try. Avoid this like the black plauge."
2,Was disappointed with the anise taste.,I looked forward to this tea and I don't know why. I was disappointed in the flavor and I have made better tea myself by adding a drop of Anise candy flavoring to green tea.
4,worked as expected,got this oil to do an oil change on a rebel 250 and has worked great so far. first time using this brand and so far no complaints
1,Cornstarch is first ingredient,The description of this product states that there is no added starch and yet the first ingredient is cornstarch. My boyfriend took this when I ordered it for him after checking the ingredients on amazon but without reading the fine print on the bottle. He is on a starch free diet because starch makes him flare up. Well now it has been about three days and he is still in severe pain. I am extremely unhappy with this and I have learned an important lesson; you can't trust that the product you receive will match the description online.
2,Did not work for me,"This product did not work as well as CM Responce for me,even if I took twice as much.It may work for others though."
2,Mandoline 2000,"I was very disappointed with this product and am returning it as it certainly didn't meet my expectations of a ""professional"" tool. When I attempted to use the serrated side of the blade, I ended up being unable to do so with carrots as it just wouldn't slice through them with any kind of even results. When using the julienne attachment, I had to go back and break apart each slice as it didn't slice through the entire vegetable (I was using the guard). I also found that the support leg was very quick to collapse. It would be nice if it locked into the open position."
1,Should be called the finger shredder,"Be very very careful when using this thing -- I was and still ended up with 8 stitches holding one of my knuckles on. The pusher (which I was using at the time) can move around on you so watch out!! My mandoline went in the garbage promptly and I'm back to using a food processor.Besides, I never could get the julienne blades to work properly as they did not fit correctly into the slicer. Bad design plus bad workmanship."
1,Not,"Having owned an inexpensive V-slicer that worked very well, I expected great results from the Matfer. I was sorely disappointed. When I tried to dice onions, the blades seemed incapable of cutting through soft foods, such as onions. When I tried to cut potatoes into fries, the amount of force necessary to get the potato through made me afraid I would slip and cut my hand on the inadequate guards. Additionally, hard foods such as potatoes or carrots inevitably had the tail end break off rather then being sliced. Finally, the blades cut to inconsistent thickness resulting in non-uniform thickness slices and waffle cuts that didn't waffle evenly. Construction seemed adequate and I did not have any problem getting the blades in and out, but the overall performance was poor."
5,Finally-A real Mandoline,"For years I put up with...imitation slicers. I purchased a Matfer and I find that I am using it more often than my food processor. It works with ease. I make a lot of one dish meals with sliced vegetables and I love it. Not only is it handy, it is easier to clean up than my food processor. I like my food processor, but now that I cook only for myself, I use my mandoline in preference to the processor."
1,USPS says delivered but I have YET to receive it!!,"Not on hold at the post office, where is this item?! Why haven't I received it yet?"
5,beautiful watch,I bought this watch as a Christmass gift yet I haven't given to this girl who I'm too shy to let her know of my attraction. Anyhow I still have it and it's very nice. I also bought the mens Pathfinder and I'm happy with both.
3,Great watch,"This is a great looking watch. It goes well with my work attire. However, it isn't easy to program, set the time, etc. I know someone who actually returned it because it is so difficult to use. But, once you figure it out it is great!"
4,casio baby-g databank watch for ladies,"I like this watch. It is lightweight and comfortable, and does not feel bulky. The color is light enough that I can wear it in a format work setting and feel good. I gave it 4 stars only because the databank pages don't seem to automatically sort themselves into alphabetic format, remaining in the random order in which they were entered. Also, there are only 20 data pages, and I would have preferred 30. Otherwise, it is easy to program and the electro-illuminescent back-light is great."
4,Pretty good.,"Much better then I expected. The watch I recieved looks quite different from the watch shown. It has a clear face instead of a purple one, also like others said the color is much more sub-dued then in the picture.This is my first day wearing it and so far so good, I was very glad to have an alarm that is loud enough to wake someone like myself up.The watch is a bit bulky if you are not used to wearing sport watches, though I am already getting used to it and loving it."
1,This is a terrible watch,"This is a terrible watch! The features are hard to figure out, and the buttons are difficult to use. The watchcase is huge, but the numerals are too small to read easily and the bands across the face obscure some of the writing on the watch. It's also fairly heavy. I've had Baby-G's before, and this particular style was a BIG disappointment. I'm sending it back."
4,Great!,"Love this watch. I'm an E.R. RN and this is my work watch. Wears well despite body fluid splashes, banging it on equipment, etc... My only grievances are: It won't tell me the day of the week and year for example: ""Fri., Aug 1st, 2008"". I work weird hours so sometimes I do forget what day of the week and year it is.... Anyway LOVE IT!! Will buy another one when this one craps out."
4,Pleasantly surprised...,I really like this watch. I like the sporty look. Very easy to set-up. I love the world clock feature. I got the watch right before a trip to Europe. So great to have the London & Rome time zones just a few clicks away versus constantly resetting my watch manually....and easy reference to multiple time zones. I used the Alarm feature as well on my trip - very easy as it requests time zone info as well. Have used the stop watch on my runs - once again easy. I had to be careful on my last watch - as I'd accidentally reset the time at the end of a run because the stop & reset were the same button. No fear of resetting as this one as start/stop & reset are different buttons.I really like the overall functionality & look of the watch. Only problem I've had - in hot weather the plastic band irritates the inside of my wrist.
2,"dirt, grime, and mold in the pins and crevices","I loved this watch when I first got it. But after a few months of wearing it everyday a couple of things happened...1) the color started getting a little greyish/ yellowish2) there was dirt, or grime, or mold building up in areas of the watch that I could not clean.Granted, I work as a firefighter...so the watch takes some abuse, but I could not clean out the moldy looking stuff, so I had to get rid of the watch. :("
2,Didn't do anything for me,"I took this according to the directions for a month. I only wanted to lose 10 pounds, but didn't lose a single pound, so I can't recommend this product."
3,An alright product,"It gives me a small amount of indigestion but the directions say take it 30min before eating, so you can't really eat food with it. This is also a different formula from the one I got a few years ago (after the whole ephedra fiasco when ephedra was removed from it) and not quite as effective for me. Others may have different results. It did give me more energy and actually more focus as well, so not all was bad about it."
1,very disapointed!!!! not what it claims to be at all!!!,It didnt help me one bit.....I noticed nothing!!! for the money i spent i was very disapointed!!!!
4,A Classic Tragedy,"This deceptively simple, underrated drama is actually a very good classical tragedy, set in colonial Africa. The protagonist is brought down by his tragic character flaw; the rules of unity are also in evidence. Give it a chance, particularly if you are a student of classical literature."
3,Okay...,"I did find this to be slow-moving, but nonetheless rewarding. So, that's a mixed review! But it was intelligently written, beautifully shot, and well-acted. And I lived in Africa for a year, and saw how some of the Africans really lived in the present, without regard for the future. And it's Mr. Johnson's disregard for the consequences of his actions that does him in. Very true to the African character, I'm afraid (call me a colonially-minded bigot if you want, but that was my experience). So I found the movie true-to-life on that score."
2,Terrible DVD quality! So-So Film.,"This DVD has the worse quality of any DVD in my collection, even though the box reads ""guaranteed superior quality"". Grainy picture, washed out colors, and sound that plays more through rear speakers are some of the low points. This is the reason for the low rating of 2 stars.As to the film, it contains beautiful African scenery which makes the poor DVD transfer that much more regretable. The acting is first rate. And the views of West African village society are insightful. However, the storyline is a rehash of the typical British colonial flick...you know, native mistreated by the overlords, gets into trouble and ends up road kill on the imperial super highway. Too bad that the director could not develop the characters better."
3,"Very enjoyable the first year, cancel it after that","The problem with bird magazines, like coin magazines, is that there's only so much to be said about the subject, and generally a one-year subscription covers it well. The photograpgy is stunning, but you can only be amazed by so many hummingbird photos. The stories start to repeat (how to ID hawks, make your back-yard into a bird sanctuary, look at the gorgeous hummers, how to ID migrants, travel stories about exotic places and their birds, birds you can see in your backyard, etc) ater a year or so.Grab the great end-of-year deals if you can, but next year try something else."
4,Wildbird,"I liked the magazine because it stayed with the articles on the cover and more on different birds, from the habits, to locating birds, what they eat, nesting patterns, ect. My favorite part of the magazine was the Bird Jokes, Contests. Wonderful magazine with pictures for kids and adults, a treasure find for any bird lover."
2,For the onithologically informed,"If you're some kind of bird expert, this magazine may inform and intrigue you. For the backyard bird feeder guys and gals and ornithologically challenged, it's entirely too technical and arcane."
4,ives,estaba buscando un producto que me ayudara con el ingles y este es muy interesante me ha gustado mucho espero
2,Take to long to come,I took about a week to leave where it was coming and then it went GA It past my state but two days after that it came..
2,There Goes a Tractor not what was expected,"This video, part of a popular series, was rather disappointing in comparison with the others. It would have been titled more correctly if it had said ""Learn About Farming."" My son 4-year-old, who loves tractors, lost interest in this video after only 10 minutes and when he was asked why he didn't want to watch he said ""it doesn't have many tractors"". The host is also somewhat annoying in his presentation, even for a 4-year-old."
4,There Goes a Tractor,"My almost 3 year old son likes There Goes a Tractor a lot. We've seen almost all the There Goes a .. series videos, and this one is one of his favorites. Also, he likes this same Dave in There Goes a Dumptruck. I didn't like this Dave's style as much as Dave Hood, who stars in the others, but my son seems to like both of them just fine."
4,Good read,I enjoyed this story. It was different with the warlock story. The hero was a very arrogant but that fit with his personality. The heroine did stand up for herself and there was a satisfying ending.
3,Not for Me,"I purchased the trilogy after reading a wonderful review form someone's list.I am an avid Nora Roberts, Danielle Steel reader and these were a bit disapointing. Too much sexual tension without the story to back it up.I read 1 1/2 of the 3."
3,Nice ride on a train.,"you feel like you are riding on a train through the countryside of the different parts of south america. this video is better than ""travel to south america by cruise"" which is not exactly sailing on a cruise ship. the only problem with this train video is that it only gives you a view of one segment of society and that however gives an impression that only poor people ride trains."
2,Follow-up,"This is a follow-up to ""Sex And The Single Girl"". It deals with surviving as a nubile female in a large office in a very large city (New York or Los Angeles). And in the 1960ies or even '50ies. Like the original, saucy sex features heavily in the title and the promise, but little in the book. Instead there are mostly anecdotes and some very jumbled advice. One example is to ignore it if your employer forces a kiss on your mouth after the job interview because he's just a weirdo who will do this to anyone. It's all a bit musty and unenlightened and unwitty. A typical follow-up, in a bad way."
5,good movie,i loved the casting and storyline. i was impressed with director tony abulu and the entire cast. story was about a nigerian boy that wants to leave the country by all means to enter Us
4,Happy.,"I love being able to complete a set with Amazon's amazing prices. If they don't have it, they offer very great companies who can offer it. They deliver fast too."
5,Smiling Country fan,"Mr. Kelton's ""The Smiling Country"" was a delightful sequel to ""The Good Old Boys"". I think the way he dealt with aging and rights of passage touches something in all of us."
5,Wow!,"When I was in school, a teacher assigned us this book.I was fascinated. They made compass cases out of melted phonograph records! They made air tubes out of hundreds of cans! They hid tunnels everywhere! And it was all TRUE!!!Unfortunately for me, the rest of the class whined that the book was boring (!!!) and the teacher had us turn them in. He had to pry mine out of my fingers. Years later, I was finally able to get a copy of the book, and it was worth it.I'd like to list the truly amazing things they did to escape the Nazi prisoner-of-war camp, but I wouldn't want to spoil the book for anybody."
4,Better than the film,"If that's possible! The movie of the Great Escape is one of my favorite all-time movies. So I was excited to read the book, and it did not disappoint. It was fascinating to read after having seen the movie, to match up the characters with their real life counterparts, to read what had really happened and what was embellished (not much!). I highly recommend the book."
1,Bleh....,"I'll admit I can't say much, and from whay other reviewers wrote, it WAS an amazing story, but does ot really call for swears? Okay, in quotes, fine. In the text, I myself find fault. I don't mean to judge, but as for those who want swear-free reading, steer clear unless you feel like using a white-out pen on practically every page. I didn't even get past the first chapter since it didn't seem worth the time and effort of whiting-out so much. This reveiw is merey my personal opinion and to also aware those that want CLEAN reading material. I am not judging. I hope I helped!!!"
4,The Great Escape,"In this installment British and American prisoners are trapped in a Nazi POW camp, and takes place in Germany during WWII. Of the group that trys to escape is the books author himself, Paul Brickhill. Led by fearless Englishmen named Roger Bushell, both British and Americans come together and plan an escape from the Nazi camp. The task is hard, digging tunnels under the camp's grounds, while creating their clothing and/or weapons needed to dig the tunnels and escpape. The men are faced with many different turnpoints and struggles like: they would have to restart digging a tunnel everytime they made a little mistake or they would have to go without any sleep night after night. I really enjoyed reading this book and recommend it for ages 6th grade and up. Thank You!"
4,Pretty good. Definitely worth watching,"Based on the comedy ONLY, I would give this a 3.5/5, but I give it a 4 cause the COMPLETELY agree with most of the jokes. There's one joke about African-Americans & Asian-Americans that I love, AND agree with totally.I've always liked Steve Byrne though. I think my fav thing with him that I've seen is a YouTube video. I think he was in the Comedy Factory. That was hilarious!! You'll know it's the one when he makes the joke about ""Spooning"" with women."
3,The Long-Awaited Garbage Truck,"I purchased this truck for my 2 1/2 year old grandson since he is mesmerized by garbage trucks. The garbage truck seems to be well made and durable, however the two trash cans that come with it are not. The prongs that hold the trash can lids onto the trash can are flimsy and break easily so that was a disappointment. For the price of the truck, I feel two extra trash cans should be included. Also, our truck did not have a CD included as shown on the picture."
2,Cheap plastic parts/don't buy,"My son loves the garbage truck but after just a few minutes of opening it and playing with it, he came to me every 30 seconds to put back the lids of the garbage cans. The lids kept on coming off! This was a Xmas gift, otherwise I would have returned it and get something of better quality. I do not recommend this product as part of the fun is to dump/empty the garbage trucks, hence the lids have to be able to open/close."
3,Not a $30 toy,"I bought this for my son for his third birthday because he had asked for a garbage truck. There is really nothing special about this toy, and I should have shopped aroud for a better value."
4,Positively Po-Town!,"I thoroughly enjoyed Poughkeepsie, NY: Halfway up the Hudson! Despite little detail about the last 40 years, it is an impressive pictoral history of an oft-maligned city. Existing in the shadows of New York City and Albany, Po-Town has earned its share of now documented historical importance; and this book."
4,GOOD OLD BLACK AND WHITE MOVIE.,"Saw this movie in a theater as a kid. Bought it for the nostalgia and was not disappointed. A bit corney, but a fun movie regardless."
2,only game in town,"Upon reaching 15k miles on my 1999 Jetta TDI I discovered I needed to chage my own oil. I purchased this manual because it was the only one to be found.Having in the past been very dissapointed in $15-$20 Haynes or Chiltons manuals, I've looked the book over with a very critical eye. This manual contains errors (and probably ommisions) and is only marginally better than the $15-$20 manuals."
3,It's okay,"Better than not having anything at all. If you can find what you're looking for, it can be kind of helpful.The index is almost completely worthless. The section on check engine light codes is about the same -- it gives a very brief description (3 words, maybe) for each code. Nothing else. I found a later version of this manual that seems to actually give some trouble-shooting ideas for each code. It's not great, but better than this one, but it unfortunately is for the 24V engine, and I have the 12V engine, so it wasn't perfect either.But, I don't think there is better info for these VWs available."
4,2000 honda 1100,"I like that way seat looks and makes the bike look. I don't like the fact it makes me feel like it is pushing me forward, I am a big guy (250+) I would think the seat would be geat for a smaller guy. I will get use to it and my wife likes the fact it makes her taller than me in the seat.It has not been a problem but the seat only mounts with the hook under the tank and the small bolt on the rear fender.I also can't use my saddle bags that fit under the old seat, no room under this seat."
4,addleman Seat,Seat is very very comfortable on long trips. I thought the firmness of the seat would be otherwise but I am very pleased.
4,Cute & reasonably priced!,I prefer to purchase inviations & thank you cards that match so this was a great deal! I do wish the thank you notes were more than just post cards but they will still do the trick!
3,Slightly unclear description,"I really liked the product. My only complaint was that in the description, I would have avoided confusion if the description was something like, ""8pcs of each"". I assumed that there was 16 of each, and I am usually a pretty careful shopper. Otherwise, I really liked the product itself and would purchase again."
4,Cute Boys!,"Overall, the story could have used more plot twists. The good looking men made it worth watching."
1,Why Why Why Why must this crap be distributed,This movie took The Vampires (1998) James Wood and slimmed it down. Low budget movie with low budget acting. Its not a very good copy to boot. The best part of the movie was the opening credits and I'm even ashamed to make that reference. Its the part with the most nudity. I can't think of a worse waste of time.
2,vampires in the hot desert,"this one pits Kerr Smith and vampire hunter Brendan Fehr up against vampires Jonathan Scheach, Simon Rex and Phina Orchure which the two have a connection with a girl they bit and the 2 boys have her and their all trying to survive. not the worst vampire pick but sure is silly with its slayings and the end is predictable but non the less its an ok view"
1,Is this never going to stop??,"Well, just another movie belonging to the garbage.... Is this never going to stop? Is this stupid waste of money going to continue producing mean and vile movies like this one?The main trouble is that there's no reference anymore at all to at least give a hint to the audience about the real potential of a movie. Money is the only guide to actors, screenwriters and producers to decided where to lend their services.Take, for example, the bad guy in this obnoxious movie, played by Jonathan Schaech. Judging by his very convincing performance in Tom Hanks's directed THAT THING YOU DO, you could never tell he would be in such a throwaway movie like this.See, I like road movies. I even liked John Carpenter's VAmpires, with James Woods. But this THE FORSAKEN is beyond description. It's simply utterly forgetabble."
1,WARNING,"This movie is over rated here at Amazon!The movie is nothing but kids stuff... there is no suspense, thriller or horror! There is nothing but topless girls and so much blood. Even the make-up is silly.It's one of the worst movies I ever saw. If I want to name a list of worst thriller movies, it would go like this:1. The Forsaken.2. From Dusk til dawn.3. Scream (part 3).4. Blaire Witch Project (part 2).Be warned..!"
3,"""I've seen better, but this is a good though""!!!!!!!!!!!!","I must say ""The Forsaken"" was a good movie with an interesting storyline, but quite frankly, it would have been better if they were serial killers or stalkers because they just didn't strike me vampires, not my definition of vampires anyway. They were doing more so shooting and hunting than flying around and feeding off these people. I didn't see any fangs or any other indications that they were vampires besides the fact that they were attracted to the sight of blood and they could let sunlight hit them. Don't get me wrong, It was a good movie, but not what I would call a vampire flick though."
2,Watched this while cleaning out my desk!,"Well, at least we have some honest people. I watched this while cleaning out my desk and the only part of the movie anybody is going to remember is the nude shots from Izabella Miko (Coyote Ugly). God bless DVD. Cough! Cough! I mean . . . God Bless DVD!"
3,More Bloody Than Expected...,"Okay, I just saw this movie last night and it was alot more bloody and gross than I expected! I mean, I love Kerr Smith and Brenden Fehr and even the main vampire guy but there was too much blood for me.I have always been attracted to vampires! I love how seductive they are!! When they gently bite your neck and the other person has a sensual look on their face... you know... the romantic stuff... But these vampires scared me! I guess that's what they were supposed to do though... In that case, it was good! I liked the story and I loved the characters. Rent this movie if you like vampires!"
3,Good for what it is,"I went to see ""The Forsaken"" in theaters initially because of Brendan Fehr, who plays the secondary lead, Nick. I went into the film expecting lots of blood, vulgarity, and sex, and that's exactly what I got. Since I wasn't expecting ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" none of that mattered to me, and I thoroughly enjoyed the film. For the type of movie it is, it's a good one. Brendan Fehr is fittingly ""bad boy,"" and Kerr Smith plays the role of a befuddled cynic quite well. The girl, in my opinion, was entirely unnecessary, and they only threw her in to have a blonde with breasts. Other than that, if you like gorey movies with a darker edge, you'll enjoy ""The Forsaken."""
3,Worth it if..,"the plot is terrible and most of the scenes are annoyingly bad, but i like this movie simply because Brendan Fehr, Simon Rex, and Kerr Smith are amazingly hott in it! if your a fan of any of those people then it's probly worth the cheap price at wal-mart, i watch it just to look at them. If your looking for an amazing vampire movie then your not going to find it in this and if you dont look Brendan Simon or Kerr then you'll probably hate this movie, if theyd used other people it would suck terribly honesty its a waste of talent..if ur looking for something good dont watch this.."
3,Not bad at all. A pleasant surprise.,"As far as Vampire movies go, this one is worth a look. I wasn't expecting much, but The Forsaken delivered a good cast, some nice f/x and plenty of (...). Not very scary, but better than you think."
2,Forsake this Film!,"What a load of rot! The main vampire in this is supposed to be a French crusader who sold his soul. He roams around the deserts of South West USA, in the car's boot! (he's driven by a Renfield-type character)Firstly; if he's been around so long, you'd think that he'd have saved up money to at least buy a decent car. (Or at least a house)Secondly; if you're a vampire, and sun-light being your major concern, why live in the desert? Why not have a house where you can at least move about in day-light hours (remember - this guy spends half his time in a car-boot!)The rest of this film offers even more stupid scenarios."
2,Vampire Flick,"Sean becomes infected with a virus that will turn him intoa vampire. A road trip picks up a hitch hiker on a trail of a band of vampires. They pick up a woman who becomes infected. The three race against time to track down and kill the source of the virus- a centuries old vampire. Outside of a few very brief nude scenes I wouldn't recommend it to anyone but horror fans or vampire enthusiasts. Worth renting once, but it's nothing special. Billed as a ""sexy"" vampire film; I agree."
3,Real good,"This movie was good, but i had to give it to a friend cuz it had lots of nudity in it. Just boobs though. Really Good picture and sound. Not cheesey"
4,as good as Lost Boys,"Ladies and gents youll love this movie, it is just as good as lost boys. It needs an alternate ending though but still worth the price"
2,Contemporary Vampire Hunter,"Sean, a young film editor, is on his way across the United States to go to his sister's wedding with a Mercedes that he is delivering to the same location, where the wedding is taking place. However, a flat tired leads to Sean picking up a hitch-hiker, Nick, who seems to be a harmless young man. As the film keeps rolling, the audience finds out that Nick is a vampire hunter and before Sean expects it they are in deep trouble. Forsaken is a horror film that causes some startling moments, but fails in delivering a solid story that keeps the audience's attention throughout the film."
1,Absolutely horrible.,"I had free passes to this movie when it first came out in the theatre and still felt like I paid too much for it. They try and hook the 18-35 male audience in the first 2 minutes by showing a (typical) naked blond in the shower, and the cliches only get worse from there. The dialogue is atrocious, the cinematography lacklustre, the premise full of holes and the suspense never builds. The director/screenwriter are obviously trying to demonstrate just how sexy and primal these bloodsuckers are, but have no real understanding of the fact that vamping for the camera in skimpy outfits and pouting have nothing to do with what makes vampires (yes, it's true), alluring and dangrously appealing. No chills, nothing original, please don't waste the precious moments of your life on this stunningly bad film."
2,Terribal movie,"How could they compare this movie to The Lost Boys?!This movie was nothing like the Lost Boys,this movie was terribal!Don't waist your money on this movie,for a good Vampire flick I recomend Interview With The Vampire or Bram Stokers Dracula."
2,One of the most lifeless and dull vampire films ever made,"Yet another predictable and silly vampire film about film editor Smith who goes on a road trip to attend his sister's wedding but ends up on the run from a bunch of blood-sucking freaks after picking up a hitch-hiker who fights them. Derivative of vampire films like NEAR DARK and JOHN CARPENTER'S VAMPIRES, this has a moment or two but becomes so dull that it actually disappoints."
1,Awful,"This movie ties only with ""Jeepers Creepers"" as cinematic ideas written by some movie executive on his/her toilet paper. It's so predictable and pejorative it borders on inane and a total waste of money. Schaech and Smith are decent actors, but you wouldn't find proof of it here. After watching this drivel for almost two hours, you'll find yourself roaming the desert looking for some impossibly attractive vampire to end YOUR misery."
4,THE OK MOVIE,THIS MOVIE IS PRETTY GOOD! IF YOU LIKE THE T.V. SHOW ROSWELL YOU SHOULD LIKE THIS MOVIE! IT ALSO STARS THE GUY FROM ROSWELL! HE IS ONE OF THE MAIN PEOPLE IN THIS MOVIE! THIS MOVIE IS NOT ONE OF THE BIG SCARYM MOVIES! IT IS SCARY BUT NOT LIKE SCREAM OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT! SO IF YOU LIKE SCARY MOVIES YOU SHOULD FOR SURE SEE THIS!!!!
1,Very disappointed with purchase,"Unfortunately the Dana Carvey Show DVD has you sit through 5 minutes of advertisements for other shows which I felt was a bit much.I bought the Dana Carvey DVD, not the Ads that come with the DVD."
5,Great Music,"I see some guy who's one of the Top 500 or something trashing Billy on his last album. What's wrong with you?! This album is great. ""No Man's Land"" is a nice, upbeat song, and the rest of the album is good. Most of the album seems to deal with the uncertainty of the near future. ""Famous Last Words"" is a fitting end to the songwriter's pop/rock career.""These are the last words I have to say It's always hard to say goodbye But now it's time to put this book away And that's the story of my life..."""
3,Okay but not his best,"Billy was getting old now and was getting tired. he needed a break this proves that even a little break would help. This album is superior to Storm Front. Most of the songs are pretty repetitive and boring, but a few rank pretty good. The best one is River of Dreams because it does not have to many boring guitar parts. It sounds a lot like some of his older matieral. The next is Goodnight My Angel for the same reason. Shades of Grey comes next because it is thrilling and would be a good concert song. The gutiars are fresh and exciting. Finally it is Blonde over Blue because of the great lyrics and cool beat. Of the rest All About Soul would have to be the best. Okay but not great"
2,"Billy Joel turns ""pop-ish""","This is a far cry from his old greats. The song ""River of Dreams"" is such an uninspiring piece of work, and the rest of the album is not that different. He's too pop - selling out to sell alot. Only ""Lullabye"" is worth an ear."
3,Not his greatest.,"I am a huge fan, and I did not find this one as good as his earlier works. The title song is definitely the best."
3,It's Okay,"I'm not really a fan of Billy Joel or anything, I just bought the album because ""Lullabye"" was the last dance at my prom. The other songs are okay, but ""Lullabye"" is my favourite."
2,So-So Finale,"It's got some catchy tunes, some stand-out tracks, but really - you'd expect a little more out of his final album after all these years. It sounds like it's supposed to be a Billy Joel album rather than giving any new definitions to what a Joel album can be. Nevertheless, fans will find it a good play with some songs that get better the more you hear them; but it is a little too produced, sometimes forced, to really be enjoyable."
4,"A Great CD, From a Great Man, With a Great Mind!","This was the one of the first cd's I ever owned, and I bought it when it was first released. I was somewhat familliar with Billy Joel's other works, but was still fairly unexposed. I knew ""we didn't start the fire"", and ""keeping the faith"" though. THIS ALBUM MADE A FAN OUT OF ME! I can honestly say that this was an excellent CD because after I was finished listening to it, I went out and bought every other Billy Joel CD... Do I think his style has changed in this one? Very much so. If you were to look at all the s**t that was going on in his life at the time, it would explain the cynical, somewhat bitter lyrics of ""great wall of china"", and ""Blond Over Blue"". Because of that, this CD stands a quarter of a notch below his other works, but I still would not hesitate to recommend this album to any Billy Joel fan, or non-fan alike."
4,"Despite what's been said about it, it's actually quite good","It's no secret that the song 'River of Dreams' is regarded as one of Billy Joel's big failures. Personally, I agree - the song is definitely worth skipping on this album. But put that aside and look at the rest of the album. 'Two Thousand Years' is one of the strongest tracks Billy Joel has ever written - it's a beautiful prayer-like song that builds plenty of momentum over five minutes. There's also the wonderful 'Famous Last Words', 'Lullabye', 'Great Wall of China', 'It's All About Soul' and 'A Minor Variation'.There's some really interesting music on 'River of Dreams', some great lyrics, and the album certainly does not deserve the flak it has received. For a Billy Joel fan or just for a casual listener, this is quite a strong album. Check it out."
1,Billy deteriorates to the point where he should retire,"Billy Joel's songwriting had been declining steadily since 1985. Though his performing ability was strong, his songwriting became little more than rewriting old 60's tunes. This decay had been building through AN INNOCENT MAN, THE BRIDGE, STORM FRONT, and now THE RIVER OF DREAMS.Only 5 songs are worthwhile to listen to, ""No Man's Land"", ""River of Dreams"", ""All About Soul"", ""2000 Years"", and ""Lullabye"". Even these do not measure up against his earlier works from his golden era.Stay away. In fact Run. Run far. Far Far Away."
1,This Dream is More Like a Nightmare,"Who taught Billy Joel how to sing and play the piano? I wonder if he can do both at the same time or if he has to stop singing, play a note and then try to sing again. China wouldn't need a Great Wall if this Cd came out back then...all they would need to do is play this thing over a loudspeaker...that would keep the rest of the world away! Hopefully we won't be exposed to this trash for at least ""Two Thousand Years""...hopefully it'll be that long before he releases another load."
5,One of the best books I have read this year,This is an excellent book! Singh has outdone himself. I like the detailed descriptions of how different cryptography algorithms work and how the codes were broken. After reading this book I think I have a much better understanding of the field. I particularly liked the chapters on the Enigma machine. It is also interesting to learn about some of the personalities associated with cryptography. I have never found another book on this subject which is so interesting and provides so much detail.
3,The Code Book,"The book was interesting and appeared well researched but the writing a little amateurish. My biggest complaint though is that the book was misbound with about 25 pages not appearing at all and 25 pages being repeated twice, once backwards. Very annoying."
2,Missing figures,"I am very disappointed that all the figures/illustrations are missing. If the publisher wishes to sell an ebook, then the ebook should contain all that is in the printed book. If for some technical or other reasons that it is not able to do so, then this should be stated in the original book review. Otherwise it is plainly deceptive selling."
2,Where are the illustrations,"Am re-reading this book on the Kindle (having lost my paper-back).Beautifully written book, but have to score it a 2 because all of the illustrations are missing. In addition, it seems to have been scanned, converted to text and then not entirely successfully proof-read. Surely there must be the original text-file somewhere.The occasional typo, no problem, but the lack of figures?"
3,Not for kindle,"Do not buy it for kindle, it lacks most of the illustrationsVery good book but for kindle its just frustrating.Update:Sometime this year (january 2012), this book received an unpdate, now you can actually see the illustrations on your kindle, since I dont own the paperback (and havent even read the whole book) I cant actually say if it has all of them, anyway now you can enjoy it enough to start reading it.I gave it 1 more star because of the update, but it is messed up that it took them so long to publish it."
4,Interesting!,The thing I liked most about this book is that I understood it. There are some cryptography books out there that are so complex it takes a srong background in programming just to get through them. This is NOT one of those books! Learning the history behind the development of different encryption methods and how to go about decrypting them was fascinating.
4,"A pleasant read, though a bit dated","I bought this book because I'm interested in cryptology but do not have the time to dig deep into specialist books. The book did not dissapoint me - it is well written, not too technical but doesn't 'dumb down' the essence of cryptology too much. The only reason why I wouldn't want to give it 5 stars is that it is a bit dated. Written quite obviously before 9/11, it is a bit too optimistic on the outcome of the battle between code makers and code breakers.A good book, fun to read, and relatively easy to grasp."
5,great book on history of encryption,My take-aways from this book:* simple language* effectively explains even the most complex of technologies* enjoyable read and never bored
4,A good read,"This is an interesting and surprisingly easy read, giving the reader a history of cryptography and predicting the next steps. It also includes tidbits on some of the interesting characters that played pivotal roles in the field."
5,Readable and interesting,"A review from the author of DREAMING YOUR REAL SELF: A PERSONAL APPROACH TO DREAM INTERPRETATION; and DREAM BACK YOUR LIFE: A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO DREAMS, DAYDREAMS, AND FANTASIES.Simon Singh's The Code Book is a fascinating review and explanation of cryptography. Placing its evolution in a historical context, the author describes the need for encryption and how more and more secure systems became necessary as each one was cracked. He takes us to the present day with our need to protect financial and other sensitive information on Internet. Considering the technical nature of his topic, Singh makes cryptography interesting and challenging. I usually read several books at a time, but this one held me to the exclusion of others until I finished it. Extremely lucid and fascinating."
5,Enjoyable and informative!,"This book is a good primer for anyone interested in an introduction to the history, personalities and methods in cryptography. I'm not very adept at math but that didn't hamper me in reading this book. Simon Singh, as he did with his book on Fermat, takes us 'innumerates' into mind when writing his books and gives clear and concise explanations that don't get lost in jargon or presume his readers are math heads.A fun and informative book on an important and facinating subject!"
5,You need not be a mathematician,"I want to echo the idea that this is an excellent book for the layperson. You need not be a mathematician to understand and enjoy this book. If you have a casual interest in science and, most importantly, a love of ideas, you'll enjoy this book. I would also recommend James Burke's The Knowledge Web."
2,Don't buy the Kindle Version,"HelloI had some time ago borrowed and read the book, and it was witty and informative. Read the other reviews about the content of the book.However, now I bought the Kindle Version, and found out that none of the various figures that are crucial to explain certain ciphers have made it into the Kindle Version.Another example: When Singh explains that he has 'hidden' a text by marking some letters on this very page with a little inconspicuous dot below, it defeats the purpose if the Kindle doesn't display those dots.Seriously, get the book, but the real book, not the Kindle Version.Cheers"
5,incredibly interesting,"Simon Singh has a true gift for writing. In the wrong hands the material presented in this book could have been dull. Mr. Singh, however, turns this material into what reads likes a page-turning novel. This book is loaded with fastinating information presented in clearly written manner. If you have even the slightest interest in the subject matter, I promise you that you will love this book. One of the things that makes it great is that it looks as deeply at people as it does at the science and math involved. You will find yourself getting attached to the men and women who were so heavily involved in the developments in this subject matter throughtout history. For a top-notch learning and entertainment experience, go read this book now."
5,A great read of a tough subject,"Singh traces the history of code and cipher making and breaking history. There has always been a struggle between those making codes and those braking codes, with implications for the people, businesses, and governments of the time. For example, we currently live in an era in which there are essentially unbreakable ciphers available, which allows for internet commerce, and companies like Amazon.com to exist. As Singh traces this struggle between code makers and code breakers, you will learn the basic elements of cryptography in a non-threatening (for non-mathmeticians) fashion."
4,Great read.,This is a well written book from an author with great knowledge on the topic. Don't be put off by all the talk about 'Where is the American side of the story' because in all honesty it's nice to read a book which is not so pro American for a change! A breath of fresh air.
5,Nice Book,"Excellent compilation of various encrypting techniques, from very beginning of encryption somewhere in old history periods."
5,Superbly written book,"This book is coherent, really well written. If you just a bit enjoy math & ciphers you must read it."
4,Fun book,Very fun and easy book to read.It is not just about codes and how to learn them.It goes back in the history and talls u all inportant events where the codes playd inportant part.It one of those books u read in a 5 days or less.If you are into codes or history buy this book
1,No Illustrations on Kindle,"This is about the Kindle version.I read the book as paperback a while ago, but I lost it when I moved around during the last few years. It's a great book and I would give it five stars, but the Kindle version is missing all illustrations. If I could give zero stars, I would - it really ruins it. Should the publisher put in the effort to include the illustrations in the Kindle version this would be a five star review for sure."
4,A book you can read,"I ordered this book, and it came in the mail. You can read it, or use it as a weight to make sure things don't blow around. It's not too heavy so you can conveniently carry it around in a bag, but be advised it cannot fit in a regular sized pocket. The jacket is nice, slightly grippy, so it's easier to hold it if that's what you want to do with it, or throw it, if you decide to do that. I didn't try tasting it. It is not especially colorful but the outside looks alluring. All in all, I am satisfied with my purchase of this book."
4,Good Introduction to Cryptography,"I read this book after reading 'Cryptonomicon' by Neal Stephenson, which is a fictional novel that also deals with secret codes and cryptography (and is an excellent read by the way). I wanted to know more about the subject of cryptography, so I tried this book out. It a very good introduction to the subject. It simplied the concepts enough so that they were easy to understand. Another good feature of this book, is that it wasn't all technical - there are historical aspects of secret codes and how those codes were broken.Simon Singh has done an excellent job of taking a complex subject, and making it an enjoyable read. If you're a curious mind who enjoys understanding how things work, read this book."
5,a good book for beginners,This is a really good book for beginners in criptography.It has the story of criptography (the explanations of ciphers and how to break them) since the first ciphers.
5,"Excellent History of Cryptography, And a Great Read!",This is one of the greatest histories of cryptography that I have ever read. It discusses many of fundamentals and also simple substitution ciphers and how they are broken. It keeps you in pace with the story so much so that when I learned how the Viegnere cipher was broken I originally thought it to be impossible. It is a fun read and it is clear to understand unlike some other cryptographic books and explains concepts very well. I especially enjoyed testing out trying out the Diffie Hellman key exchange and learning about the possible futures of Cryptography in Quantum Computers and Quantum Cryptography. A must read for anyone interested in learning the basics of cryptography. Definately a great place to start!
3,The code book,"This book was a little bit disappointing. Simon Singh is usually more exciting, but in this book he is a little bit too UK-centered. For instance, he gives an extensive description and history of the decoding of the German ENIGMA code by the British, but only a few words on the American decoding of the Japanese Purple code. As a general introduction to coding and decoding, it could have been shorter, as a detailed introduction, then it should have covered more areas."
3,Good background for encryption,"This is a good book to provide a minimal background for most people for the subject of encryption. For many this might not be an exciting subject. But thanks to this book it helps explain its relevance and history. Besides providing a background on encryption it highlights a story about a true hero of great genius. Unfortunately as the story unfolds he will be maligned and harassed until he ends his life, just because he was homosexual. Regardless of his choice of partners, his work and mind were brilliant."
2,Do You Want To Play 'The B...eale Game'... Ask ME How?,For the most part... it was a very interesting book. It's biggest FAILURE was not having a better understanding of 'WHAT' the mystery is really about... 'WHO' created the mystery and 'Why' it was created... 'Where' the mystery will ultimately take you to. Mr. Singh and others like him have no idea that the one 'allegedly' deciphered message STILL HAS parts that have as yet not been divulged to any one other than myself. IF he were truly serious about an accurate understanding of the B...eale mystery... he should have spoken to me first.
5,Great stories of codebreaking,"Singh's book on a topic that many would find boring is actually a delight. Though a little part of the book is donated to how codes are broken and definition, the stories in the book are the true gems here. If you love history of any kind- pick this book up."
5,Fantastic introduction to cryptography,"Fantastic introduction to science of cryptography and it's history. Goes into a lot of information about how various codes work, how they're broken, and so on.I only have a couple of criticisms of the book, namely that it leaves out some very important encryption systems. Very little is talked about the coding systems used by the US and the Allies, and by the Japanese, in WWII. The use of the Navaho language is extensively covered, but the more traditional systems are hardly mentioned. Also, there is virtually no mention at all about how modern symmetric cyphers, such as DES or the new AES (Rjindael).All in all though, a great read an a good introduction to the field and it's history."
5,The Code Book: THe Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography,"Amazing and touching stories with incredible insights of knowledge. Cryptography becomes interesting, intriguing, fun and highly readable under the author's writings. I never bother to write a book review and I think it is only fair to write one and recommend it to the readers for all the efforts the author has put into this book.It is also very educational to kids even they are not into science (how can they not to if just be ""naturally"" curious) . For example, the story of Decipherment of Linear B. And it is also a very moving story behind how ARS becomes RSA of public key cryptography. I see the integrity and dignity of those intellectuals. Apparently they are the role models for kids.This book worths million dollars more to me."
4,Another lucid winner from Simon Singh,"From the writer of ""Fermat's Enigma"" comes another lucid, mathematics-based history, this time of codes and cyphers.Again, like his previous book, I was (despite scraping by/flunking all my college math courses) was able to easily follow his history of codemakers, codebreakers, and their endless intellectual battles for supremacy, complete with examples of how do make and break codes and cyphers.Highly recommended."
5,Deserves more than 5 stars!,"This book is a wonderful blend of technical writing with allied history, story telling and myth. The author traces the evolution of code making and code breaking from historical times with interesting stories regarding their development and usage and the great minds who were behind the codes.The author has a flair of explaining technical stuff to lay people. It was a pleasure to read through the technical details of codes right from the Vignerre cipher right upto RSA. There is even a chapter on decryption of Egyptian hieroglyphics and other lost languages, even though technically they are not codes (since they were not used to hide information). I loved the description of the German code machine used in WW2 and how it was broken, quite ingeniously, by Polish and British cryptoanalysts. There are even some exercises for budding cryptoanalysts.In summary, this book gets a wholehearted thumbs up and I now plan to read other books of the same author."
3,Not a fan.,"My wife has her CD player filled with Joel. She loves his music, me, not so much. Some tracks are fine."
3,Is vinyl or is it Memorex,"Streetlife Serenade was a favorite in high school. I was looking forward to listening to it all again, and I did indeed get to listen to it all. But I would swear it's not a CD created from the original analog tapes. It sounded more like a tape recording of a vinyl album (remember how you would tape an album so you could listen in your car?) It's complete with hiss, pops, and clicks just like listening to vinyl. What's up with that?"
4,Underratted,"Everything Billy Joel did after this album is either great(Turnstiles, The Stranger, The Nylon Curtain, An Innocent Man, Stormfront, River of Dreams) or near-great(52nd Street, The Bridge). While this album isn't at that level it's better then his previous album 'Piano Man'. There is some very appealing music here. It's much better then a lot of hardcore Billy Joel fans would have you believe. The only Joel album I think is really substandard is Piano Man. (You can get the title song on compilations!)"
4,Very nice organ sound,"Rocket Science's songs have a different feel to them, mostly because of the fact that the music is constructed around a very cool analog organ. The song Copycat demonstrates the capabilities of this instrument to produce a theramen-like sound that totally rocks. Definitely worth a listen"
4,This Week I Read a Really Fun Book...,"Ahead of the trend...Brewer's ""stream of conciousness"" style brings to mind the current focus on opinion style books. Much in the vein of Terri Hatcher's ""Burnt Toast"" and the like.This woman's down-to-earth, unjaded look at her world and the world around her is endearing. Dottie's writing style is like dishing with your best girlfriend...she will make you cry and leave you laughing.Brewer's story is the story of everywoman growing up today, learning as she goes and faced with a comnpletely new set of options and obstacles from those that went before us. Dottie looks at each one and moves through them (from breast implants to abusive relationships), of course hindsite is 100%. Because this is written after-the-fact it allowed her to step back and take a more complete look at some situations...and probably was a little cathartic....and then there is that part about John Wayn Bobbitt, inquiring minds want to know!"
4,"Aw, you peeked! Knew you would!","Yes, it's there, in all the gory details. Dottie does talk about her courtship, marriage and 'it.' So, if you're into the titillating details about Bobbitt's bobbing baby...and want to know what HE calls it - read on.But, there's a lot more to this book. Dottie talks about many of her life experiences, the lessons she's learned, the wisdom she's gained, her personal heroes and gurus. The index is actually suprisingly educational.So, while you may buy the book to satisfy your curiousity,you may enjoy the rest of it more than you ever expect.And you've got to love the name of Dottie's publishing company.Billion $ Baby Publications ..."
1,THIS IS A SCAM DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!,"These ear rings were going to be for my prom, i wanted them so bad as they were perfect for my dress, i could not afford it as i spent so much on other things, well my rush delivery it came out to be 23 dollars, my little sister with her babysitting money offered these as my graduation present! imagine her dissapoint when all her late hours taking care of screaming babies were for a rip off!! the earrings are about as tiny as my pinky nail! so sad they wouldve been the perfect gift :/ i tried contacting this seller and NO ANSWER!! when ups delivered it, the seal was already broken and the driver didnt even bother to knock our door he threw it on our door step and ran, no time to get to him..this was my first online purchase i have learned my lesson.."
3,SPARKLE,LOVE THESE EARRINGS- GOT FOUR PAIR-- WANT MORE!!!! THESE WERE A GIFT--LIKE OTHER COLORS- CASUAL/ GREAT PRICE.
1,"I can sum this one up in with one word, LOSER!","I found this book to be much longer than necessary, extremely boring and amateurish. The author did nothing to develop the characters and portrayed them as shallow, petty, stupid, jealous people who were, for the most part, unlikeable.The story line was imbued with inaccuracies where both computer technology and the travel industry were concerned, and these inaccuracies highlight the authors obvious lack of research. I almost begged for Diane and Jeff to simply ""get on with it"" as the supposed romantic portion of this lame storyline dragged on and on. If the overuse of adverbs is your thing, then this book is definitely for you, but in reality I was almost driven crazy by them. I gave this one a single star simply because you can't give a no star rating. Don't waste your time on it."
2,Not remotely believable due to the author's ignorance about technology,"This story had possibilities, but when you see the glaring errors regarding computers, software, online bulletin boards and viruses - it completely destroys any credibility in the tale. And as mentioned by another reviewer, the tech part of the story seemed to be just stuck in there and went nowhere. I am not familiar with the travel industry, but even I could tell that the characters were not true to life regarding what would be expected of an actual tour agent; from the little I have seen of that job, there is no way that a person doing that job would have all the free time the author wrote into the story.It was bad enough that I removed it from my Kindle, and I won't be reading any more of this author's work."
3,Ok... but not great.....,"I prefer 101 Hikes in Southern California Gary Schad to this one. Origanally I had gotten this one because while I had hiking books about Southern California, I had only a few that were about the local area of Orange County. Honestly, I was very excited to see new places to hike around here, but I was quite disappointed. There are many hikes here in OC that are left out, and only limited references to the many hikes in our various local regional parks. There are no pitures, which I was a little bummed about. It helps for picturing where you are going, and the maps are not defining enough for the pages they take up.While the book does cover a few interesting places, it covers no more than most other books about hiking in the area that cover all of Southern California."
2,"Nice maps, not much else to love","This guide has very clear, easy-to-follow maps, which can be a big help. Other than that, it's not much. Very brief hiking directions, not much info about what you're seeing, dry writing. No photos and that's a loss. I get excited about hikes by seeing what they look like. A number of hikes that are more neighborhood walks than a hike. The author might have been better off choosing fewer hikes but making them good ones, and using the extra space for photos and better descriptions."
3,Foster and Robbins,"I gave this movie only 3 stars cause unless you like Jodie Foster's younger works and enjoy Tim Robbins' earlier works you prolly won't appreciate this film as much. Otherwise you may be delighted with this film, keeping in mind it's an indy flic, and appreciating it as such."
1,Worst movie I have seen in a long time,Jacket cover on movie states comedy drama. I failed to see anything at all funny in this movie. I thought this movie was very disturbing. While Tim Robbins and Jodie Foster put in a good performance the story line was jumbled and disconnected.This movie has moved in top place of 5 worse movies I have seen.
3,Good movie but crap quality DVD,"I just saw this movie and my feelings are somewhat mixed. The film itself is quite good, atmospheric and surprising. On the cover, however, the words ""superior quality"" are printed. A word of warning: only compared to your old 8mm films! The picture is grainy, when blown up to fit a wide screen tv this becomes painfully obvious. The sound is quite good, but the chapter index is way off. When you select the first one you actually skip the start of the movie. Furthermore the scenes are not numbered and there is no time stamp so you can only guess how long it is. This dvd is not only available in the region 1 version but also in a region-free version. I bought mine in the Netherlands. I don't assume the American version is different though. Bottom line: Good movie but crap quality DVD. (On the other hand, it is so dirt cheap that you can't really complain too much.)"
5,...Not to Mention the Penguins,"This is ensemble work at its best. A product of George Harrison's Handmade Films, it includes not only Jodie Foster and Tim Robbins, but also Todd Graff (""Hippie"" in The Abyss), John Turturro, Elizabeth Berridge (""Mrs. Mozart"" in Amadeus) with nicely interwoven storylines that dovetail spectacularly at the finish. Five stars means I own a copy (VHS since 1989, DVD since 2001) and watch it every year or so."
3,Lord of the Rings Fellowship of the Ring - Superposeable Strider Review,"I am an 11 year old boy.4 days ago, me and my bother opened the box containing Strider, a few seconds later his right hand broke off but it was easy to glue back on. Sadly, in addition to his hand snapping off, so did his sword holder and cloak strap.The detail on the face is not that great; his eyes are crossed and his facial expression makes him look confused and worried instead of fierce and strong.The toy is nice, I really like the sword and body sculpture. I would recommend this figure as a collector's item that would remain in his box but I would NOT recommend this figure for a child to then play with."
1,dumbest movie ever made,"This movie was the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. I have seen many,I'am 35 and sat through many bad movies. This one I hated. I can't believe I paid 3.00 to watch it..Please anyone who reads this don't take 2 hours out of your life for this movie. I should have just bought a pop and a candy bar. I would have felt better about that."
2,Review,"This movie wasn't even scarey. The title & description were misleading, ans all the best parts were used in the trailer.Would recommend people save their money and not rent this!"
1,WTH,"I don't know what to say other than what a waste of money for me, a waste of time for the so called actors, a waste of time for the people behind the camera. Just plain awful. I don't know what this crap was and neither do they."
4,Very easy,"This DVD was not available in Germany, so it was the only opportunity for me to buy it here. And that is what I did.The whole purchasing process was very uncomplicated, easy to understand and I received the DVD earlier than announced - all the way to Germany!There is nothing to complain about.;-))The packaging was safe and sufficient.The DVD was well protected and I received it undamaged. The article was delivered like described.I only can watch it on my computer, but this may concern to my DVD-player.I'm already looking for the next article that I want to buy. ;-))Thank you so much."
2,Better be handy with a soldering iron!,"As other reviewers have noted, the cigarette lighter plug supplied with this unit is, to put it charitably, fragile. It shattered the first time I attempted to pull it out of the socket. Fortunately, I had other compatible plugs handy that weren't needed for other devices, so I soldered the 12V leads from the compressor into a new plug. Now it works fine.OK, it's noisy and slow, but for a cheap unit, it seems to pump effectively. With it, I can refill the spare tire on my Prius, which requires 50 psi. All small pumps take a while to fill a tire, but using this unit is a lot easier than delivering 100 strokes with a hand pump."
4,Good Compressor,"Good Item but it warns you not to leave it on for more than a minute because it will overheat.I haven't had a problem because my tires typically fill up in less than a minute, but if you need to top off all 4 tires its a pain."
1,Defective product,"This product was defective. It did not work, right out of the box. I plugged it in and it did not turn on. I tried several times. It did come on for a split second on one of the subsequent attempts, but would not start again. Not sure what the problem was, so it was returned and the purchase price was refunded."
1,Garbage - good for 6 uses,I bought this at Target for $15.49Used it 6 times in cold weather (10-15 degrees F).Filling up a tire takes 10 minutes.It started to smell like oil and then the motor started turning very fast and it no longer generated any pressure.I don't care that it is very loud and vibrates across the ground.But it should last longer than 6 uses.I returned it. Save your money.
2,for limited emergency use only,This is not a air compressor for regular use. I got it with the expectation of being able to more easily maintain optimum pressure in my vehicle tires by filling them at home rather than relying on using the gas station air pump. It takes about one minute per PSI to add air to my tires with this compressor. I have never attempted to inflate from total flat but I don't think that would be a likely scenario since if a tire was totally flat it would need a change. I have used this to add air when my tires are at 27 or 28 PSI to bring them up to spec'd 32 PSI. It takes one full minute to add one PSI of pressure to a tire. Versus about 5 seconds using a large compressor at a filling station.After adding 3 PSI each to all 4 tires (about 15 total minutes) this thing was so hot I could not even pick it up. I don't think it will survive prolonged use.I will not be using this for routine maintenance any more. This will be in my car for emergency purposes only.
3,Little slow,"Works ok, but is slow to fill a bicycle tire to 40 psi, not sure how long it would take on a car tire??"
3,It works anyway...,"I got this Slime compressor to carry on my motorcycle. I've used it for other tires (car and bike) and it works OK; It's noisy as hell, gets hot and the nozzle lock can be finicky, but it does its job; and if I can get back on the road after plugging a tire it is well worth every penny. Time will tell!"
1,NOT Auric Blends,"This is not Auric Blends incense. Don't be fooled. The order arrived 2 weeks after I ordered it (past the estimated delivery date), and as soon as I pulled the package out of the mail, I could smell the cheap incense that it was before even opening the envelope. This is a cheap, knock-off incense. Don't buy."
4,Very educational and fun,"First off, I recomend purchasing this video along with There Goes A Tractor, the videos go together. There Goes A Tractor should be viewed first. It shows how crops on a farm are planted. There Goes A Farm Truck goes into what happens to crops and trees when the fruit, vegetables, and grains need to be harvested and what happens to the produce after it leaves the farm. It shows how cows are milked and the inside of a ice cream plant. Most of this is well explained and easy for kids to understand (my child is 2 1/2 and loves these videos). Of course, the narrator Dave does act goofy sometimes, which can be annoying since these videos could stand alone without all the play acting. However with this Dave its easier to watch, maybe because he's younger than the original Dave (Hood)."
3,not as good as the Dave Hood videos in the series,"This video does not feature Dave Hood. It stars David Sidoni who tries, maybe a little too hard. It makes you appreciate Mr. Hood as goofy but watchable. Whenever we watch it, our toddler yells ""Where's Dave? Where's Dave?"", and I find myself wondering the same thing. The acting in general is pretty bad.The content is interesting but limited to harvesting and processing. We see broccoli, lemons, lettuce, carrots, sugar cane, sugar beets and hay being harvested. Then we see them cleaned and prepared for shipping to stores. (There is no ice cream plant, as another reviewer stated.) The trucks we see are mostly harvesters, balers, washers, tree shakers and fork lifts. The only tractors are seen as they pull alongside harvesters, but from the reviews it seems that these must appear in 'There Goes a Tractor'.The material that's here is interesting, but I think it suffers from the absence of Dave Hood and a rather limited overview of farm equipment."
3,Ewan McGregor by Brian Pendreigh,"I like this book. The writter goes into the history of McGregor. Robert Roy McGregor. The writter interviews some of Ewan's friends and school mates. There is 8 pages of pictures. All in black and white. The writter looks at most of his important movies. Talk alot about feature movies. He takes you into the process of what a struggle it was to make some of these pictures. Especialy A Life Less Ordinary. He even goes on to why Ewan even took the job. You find out everything about what gossip that happend on the set to the things done off the set. The very interesting thing in the book in the Filmography. It gives ratings, year, production company, cast and crew. I liked it. It was different from the rest of the Ewan McGregor Books. I pick it because of the great pictures."
4,Fun new single,"Move over Pet Shop Boys, Erasure prove that fun is what it's about! Sounding a tad bit like Abba, Sunday Girl is nostalgic in it's danceable approach to keeping dance music alive. Check it out!"
5,Surprisingly hilarious,"While going into the theater, I was clueless on what to expect from this movie. What I got was a movie that made my whole day seem brighter. Great acting, great laughs, and great surprises are what makes this movie a definite 5 on my scale. If you haven't seen it yet, you don't know what you're missing."
5,Ready to Rumble!!!,"Ran across this movie with no expectations, quickly became one of my fav's. Turn your brain off and get ready to laugh yourself silly. Oliver Platt is Genius as Jimmy King. The rest of the cast is hilarious. Best enjoyed with a group."
3,Funny.,"If you're not into slapstick humor, I will definitely NOT recommend this movie to you. A lot of the comedy in this movie came from sight gags and physical comedy. David Arquette and Scott Caan play two wrestling fans from Wyoming who take it upon themselves to rescue their favorite wrestler, Jimmy King (Oliver Platt), from wrestling oblivion. The situations that these two guys get themselves into in the process, including entering the STEEL CAGE OF DEATH with about ten other wrestlers and meeting Jimmy King's supposedly dead parents, provide most of the humor for the film.This is not a ""sophisticated funny"" movie nor is it a pure ""stupid funny"" movie. This is just a straightforward flick about two guys of less than average intelligence putting their mark on the world (of WCW wrestling). I didn't laugh all the way through, but it was a decent comedy. If you've been thinking you might enjoy this, but weren't sure, pick it up. You won't be disappointed."
3,Oooooook,"This was an ok Movie. Funny at times... Makes fun of WCW and wrestling somewhat,but this dvd is saved by Clips of Fyre in the movie :^)as well as the old WCW people."
5,this movie rocks,this is one of the best movies i've seen since dumb and dumber.the ball shots at the end are the funniest.
1,the movie i never got,i never recieved this movie. i was really looking foward to getting this movie and waited and waited but never got the movie. i dont know what the deal is but i am very unhappy.
5,Great Wrestling Action,"Ready To Rumble is a great movie for all fans of wrestling. It does't matter if you like WWF or WCW, you must see this movie. Can Gordy and Shawn help Jimmy King win the WCW World Title and a Grand Prize of $1,000,000? Check out this movie today! WCW wrestlers that make appearances are: Booker T., Sting, Goldberg, The Disco Inferno, Perry Saturn, Sid Vicious, Juventud Guerrera, DDP, Bam Bam Bigelow, Kidman, and many more!"
4,hey,i like it im a huge wrestling fan!! especially the part of the icon sting!! love it!! go wrestling!!! ya!!
5,Ready to Rumble,This was a Christmas present for my brother. The month or so leading up to Christmas we had started quoting the movie and talked about how the movie was so corny it was kinda good. The funny part of the whole thing is that on Christmas morning we almost opened up a present from each other at the exact same time to reveal that we both had the same idea. I bought him this copy and he bought me a copy.
2,"""Ready to Rumble"" Lacks A Certain Flair","And I'm not just talking sophisticated, urbane dialogue here. I'm talking the man who best represents World Championship Wrestling,the federation promoted in this tape. ""Ready to Rumble"" would have been a 4-star masterpiece if it featured 14-time WCW Heavyweight Champion, Nature Boy Ric Flair. (WOOOOO!) At its best, ""Ready to Rumble"" offers dazzling wrestling photography choreographed with Busby Berkley-esque skill by WCW Superstar Chris Kanyon and a great (albeit short) sequence featuring Macho Man Randy Savage, (OOOOOOH YEAH!) but, unfortunately, all that is obscured by a paper-thin plot and unbelievable characterizations by David Arquette, Scott Caan, Oliver Platt, and actors who deserve better, such as Martin Landau. I would like to give big ups to WCW's new chairman, Shane McMahon, and Shane-O Mac,if you're reading this, I hope you don't greenlight a ""Ready to Rumble 2."""
5,Ready to Rumble,"Ready to Rumble; If you ejoy the show, the WWF style display of showmanship and combat this comedy is painful amusing and good for a night with the guys over beer and chips"
2,Ready to Stink,"Even though I love pro wrestling,I don't like this movie anymore. There was too much slime humor,too many wiener jokes,too many kick to the wee-wee jokes & lame sex jokes. I heard & seen better jokes from 3 Ninjas:High Noon at Mega Mountain. The wrestling is ok. The acting is lame & second-rate. I seen better acting from the robot in Rocky 4. The Villain is laughable and dresses like a Chuck Norris reject. The Sub-plots are just filler. The Sal Bandini guy is weird but still better actor then the rest of the cast. The epilogue is unreal & dumb. The Message about dreams can come true if work hard enough is a good message but it was ruined by bad acting & slime humor. A good message ruined by bad delivery? Reminds me of ""The Pagemaster"" I give this film a 2 out of 10."
3,Spanish movie,"The movie itself was received in excellent condition and on time, BUT it was advertised as Spanish sub titles. The entire movie was in Spanish. Sub titles would be ok as I was replacing the one we used to have and VHS is hard to find. It was also meant as a birthday present. I ended up buying the DVD version from someone else."
4,"Slim, excellent spatula!","The spatula works great, very slim and great to pick things up from nonstick pan. The only minor point is there was some slight softening/melting of the spatula during a period of excessive use (flipping pancakes for 15-20 minutes). But, I have not seen any serious melting, just softening, so I'm not too worried about it as long as I move quickly."
4,"Pricey, but it is a good spatula.",This is my second of these spatulas. They are nice to handle and slide easily under and egg or much heavier fare. They do tend to absorb color though - curry and beets will leave their mark on these spatulas.
5,Best spatula ever,"This is strong and thin and perfect for many uses, especially eggs and stir-fry and most everything else. I think I need 3 more!"
4,Liked better than I thought I would,"My Tupperware spatula of 20+ years broke and they do not make them anymore so I wanted to try something else. Looking for light weight take high heat flexible and the end will stay SMOOTH not get little ridges, snags etc. So far this one is doing great a little narrow and has started to discolor at the edge some has kept it from getting higher stars."
4,Works well,"Nice tool, works well, non mar in my pots. Good angle on blade. The blue color is a little unsettling to my spouse, but color does not affect function so I am pleased."
1,So Disappointed,"I purchased this item based on the really positive reviews on Amazon. This might be the first time those reviews let me down. Maybe I missed something, but I used this spatula to flip mushrooms browning in a stainless steel skillet. It flipped them beautifully. But the spatula melted on its backside. Perhaps it's only useful on non-stick pans?"
2,"Nice shape, but can't take the heat","I bought several of these for Christmas stocking stuffers. Particularly, I thought that my absent-minded professor son-in-law would appreciate the high heat aspect. I kept one for myself. I like the shape. However, the end of the utensil sears just like every other teflon type utensil. And, this is without any abuse, such as leaving the end of it in a pan. Each time that I wash it, I end up taking my fingernail along the edge to scrape off the frayed material.I would have rated this higher because of the handy shape. However, the product description of withstanding high heat is a big disappointment to me."
3,Overpriced - very overpriced,"As I write this, this spatula is selling for about two or three times what it is worth. I have one and like it. It is my favorite spatula for non-stick cookware. But there is no way that it is worth more than ten bucks. It is plastic, folks. Nylon. Matfer turns these out for about fifty cents each, but because a big-time cooking magazine gives it good ratings the price goes through the roof. I'm glad that I bought it when I did, but would feel pretty foolish if I were to buy it at this price."
2,Melted with normal pan use,"I forget where I heard good things about this, but it didn't deliver like I hoped. The end got that melted plastic appearance that happens with so many, and even as new it had flash lines from the mold, or so it seemed. Sticking with Oxo's silicone 600 degree safe spatulas for now."
2,Loved this spatula but it is peeling Matfer Bourgeat Master Chef Spatula,"I received this sometime early October and I LOVE IT - pancakes, fish, stir fry, just love it - went to use it today and see a string on the end of it - closer examination and it looks likethis item is ""coated"" with a material that is now peeling right off - like a snake skin. I gave it two stars because I don't know what this material is and some has come off in my food. I contactedAmazon and they are sending a new one because I do love the spatula and want to try again - hoping I just got a bad one. Quality control should be alerted to this, it is made in France."
5,My favorite,"It seems hard to get excited about a spatula, but this is a great product. The design makes it easy to get under food like grilled cheese and pancakes. I've had the spatula about 6 months now and it has held up to daily use. I'm buying another."
5,Overall Pleased with Purchase,"But two of these a year ago, and am still very satisfied with my purchase. The Spatulas are a lot sturdier and stronger than I had expected and they turn anything I need like a dream. The only gripe that I have with these is the maximum temperature. The packaging says it's safe up to 430F. I decided to give this a test one night when I was shallow frying some tofu and the spatula started to bubble up a bit. Not a huge deal, I'll still rebuy them once these ones have ceased. BUT BEWARE: Temperature tolerance is not as high as the packaging says."
5,Thin and Nimble,"This turner is perfect for flaky fish, pancakes, anything. It can slide into a smaller frying pan no problem, and it's think, so it goes easily under food. I use it often. It also fits well in my drawer as it is pretty flat."
5,my favorite kitchen tool,"fish, eggs, burgers, onions, this is the tool. i've even had my wench leave it on the pan and it didnt melt. this thing can stand a lot of heat and is both flexible enough to slip under light fare and strong enough to lift something larger like a thin steak"
4,Thin is in.,"i bought this spatula specifically for the fact that it is super-thin where most plastic or other nonstick safe spatulas you might as well use a rubber scrapper to try to flip things.one star taken off for the way-to-sticky adhesive used on the label; had to use goo-gone to remove it and for the fact there was a fine mold flashing completely encircling the spatula; for $4 i expect it; for $12, they should have removed it for me so i didn't have to.it is thin enough that it won't hold a ton of weight like a steel spatula. i haven't run into any problems yet and i'm glad i bought it. Oh one last thing; i bought the 'red' version but it's thin enough that light comes through and it looks more like dark orange, just a caution for somebody that is outfitting their kitchen in red; it won't match 'red' items.awr"
5,Thin spatula really works,"I fry a lot of foods and found the Matfer Pelton Spatula to be as good as its word for use on non-stick pans. It is both thin and flexible, and gets under delicate foods without gouging them, but has enough rigidity to handle their weight. Wide slots drain quickly. Haven't tested it beyond oil temperature of 375 degrees F. No signs of melting or degradation."
1,heat-resisting claims: dubious,"The ""Product Features"" for this spatula tout it as being ""Heat resistant up to 430F degrees fahrenheit"" and the ""Amazon.com Review"" says it's made to stand up to ""extra-high heat"" and that you needn't worry if you leave it leaning against a hot pan because ""it won't melt."" In fact, upon my first or second use of this product, it melted. I didn't even leave it leaning against a hot pan, or use it with ""extra-high heat,"" as far as I can tell. I was simply using it to flip salmon fillets in a hot skillet, and the mere act of making contact with the skillet for a few split seconds to scoop the spatula under the fillets caused the front edge of the spatula to melt. So, can't really heartily recommend this for most skillet cooking occasions."
3,Heat resistant isn't what you might think,"I am a big fan of Cook's illustrated so I thought this on their recommendation. It's a nice-looking spatula. However, even though it says it's heat resistant to 430 F, mine already has some marks where it's melted slightly and I'm confident my pan was never that hot! I'm replacing this with a slotted silicone spatula."
2,Nothing Special,I didn't find anything special about this spatula.I bought it thinking that it is different than the metal one that I am using.It works the same way as my old metal one.I regretted ordering it especially because of the expensive shipping.
5,Nice size,Great little tool. Especially useful for smaller sized non-stick pans. Shape and curves make it easier to maneuver underneath whatever it is you are trying to flip.
5,Best spatula I've ever had,"Saw this on America's Test Kitchen. Works great. We left on *on* a burner and it partially melted, so I'm buying another one."
5,"Great spatula, very ergonomic","We bought this spatula after our Kitchenaid spatula cracked (after 1 year of use.) This one is very ergonomic and light. It's a pleasure to hold it. Also, it is easily washed. It looks very durable, will see how long it will last."
4,I like it,Not sure what's up with the way negative reviews. I think this things is about as well built as any other spatula of this nature. If you want stronger you'll have to get something metal or wood. It's holding up well for me. I did notice just a little bit of peeling at the end after the first use but there has been no more and it's not any worse they any other spatula of this type I've used before. It may be a bit overpriced but that's all a matter of if you can find it cheaper anywhere else or not. We are using almost daily now and have no complaints.
1,not heat resistant,"I have used this a total of 5 times and the front edge is already melting. Note i never leave it in the pan. its only time in the pan is while i am stirring, flipping or scooping things out. This is also only hand washed."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this some months ago based on the many positive reviews this product received. However, I have found it to be no better than the two or three Brand X spatulas that I already have; ones that cost a dollar or two. Another thing, be careful not to rest this against a not pan for long or else it will be permanently marred. All in all, I'm disappointed with this item."
4,Terrific Book!,"My two-and-a-half year old and I just discovered this one by David McPhail, one of our favorite authors. It's right up there with our other favorites by McPhail, like our beloved ""Andrew's Bath"" ""The Bear's Toothache"" and ""Great Cat."" This particular book is very much in the tradition of Mercer Mayer's ""There's Something There!"" trilogy, which we also relish. All in all, a great story, with the perfect amount of fantasy and excitement."
5,Best of Joel........?,"Maybe, the Stranger is a strong first place contender though. On Storm Front I think Joel was really at his best. he was married to a beautiful woman, had a kid, was doing well, was thin, was painting his baldspot, had hair, life was good and this album reflected that. I remember when this album came out and was just blown away by it. This one comes in second to the Stranger, but some of my best memories from college revolve around this album. Everything is strong on this one, and it should definately be a part of your collection. I would also recommend the live versions on the New York/Yankee Stadium album, where he really belts them out."
2,"Too strained and ""pop"" for the Virtuoso","Looking back on this album, it really lacks any of the elements that make the ""classics"" by Billy Joel truly special.Blow by blow:""That's Not Her Style"" - fun rock song. That's all.""We Didn't...Fire"" - Just listen to the music and ignore the words - this is just a terrible song.""Downeaster.."" - okay song""... Extremes"" - Pop/rock-ish; good piano solo.""Shameless"" - he should be for writing this one.""Storm Front"" - decent, but feels like he's forcing it.""Leningrad"" - interesting lyrics""State of Grace"" - nothing special""When in Rome"" - forgettable""And So It Goes"" - now this is a special song. If you really like the B. Joel songs that dig deep and you feel every note and lyric, this is the one. You're better off downloading this one song than buying the whole album.Get yourself the ""Songs in the Attic"" album and call it a day."
2,Billy as Byran Adams,"The Bridge takes a lot of flack for being the worst of Billy Joel's later albums, but Storm Front is just as much a letdown. The biggest mistake Billy makes here is hiring Mick Jones of Foreigner to produce the album. His vast, atmospheric production hinders most of Billy's gifts as both a performer and songwriter (wit, irony, SUBTLETY!) and transforms him into a Eddie Money, Bryan Adams wannabe. Even Billy's most insigtful material (""The Downeaster 'Alexa') is dragged down by the production. But even a first-rate producer couldn't help the second side of the album, his worst songs since Cold Spring Harbor. Thankfully, he recorved in four years with River Of Dreams."
3,And So It Goes...,"This album isn't a GREAT Billy Joel album. The hit ""We Didn't Start The Fire"" is as annoying as ""It's Still Rock & Roll To Me"". BUT...BUT.... this album contains, in my opinion, the most intensely haunting and beautiful song Billy Joel ever recorded, ""And So It Goes"". The first time I heard this song, I cried and was physically pinned to my seat. If his new ""classical"" direction contains melodies and chords like the one in this song, in my opinion, he'll be very successful in his new direction."
2,Billy continues to fall apart creatively,"Billy Joel, though he was losing his songwriting ability, had somewhat rebounded from THE BRIDGE with a better album, STORM FRONT. It is a history lesson and largely reflects on the cold war and the struggles of the baby boom generation. ""We Didn't Start the Fire"" is the obvious single. ""I Go to extremes"" lacks the guitar depth of ""You may be right"". It is pointless to go into specifics. Summed up, the album can not hold its own in comparision to GLASS HOUSES or THE STRANGER,. It is probably on a par with PIANO MAN. It is only worth listening to one time only.Save this one for later....."
3,Ok but only 50 sheets,"I only give it 3 stars because it's only a 50 sheet pad which is awfully expensive. And, runs out sooner.Paper tears nicely off the pad."
4,"Very pretty and colourful, but not bright","I am happy with this product. I was looking for much brighter colours, but I found the colours to be softer as opposed to being brighter. It appears to be a strong bag since it is manmade material, but I would not have paid that amount for the bag if I could have seen it before I purchased it. That selling price should really be for stronger material, like leather. I would suggest having an optional long strap."
4,Basic but effective,"If you've been around boats for a while, you've noticed all sorts of shapes and hull designs. This book explains why.Every design has strengths and weaknesses. Every hull is a compromise. Don't expect design tables or details, just good basic information"
2,Stick with Part 1!,"Nearly everything about this film pales in comparison to the original! From the technical aspects-cinematography, editing, sound, ect.-to the writing and overall acting, it makes you want to pop the first film in the DVD player and watch it yet again.One of the criteria for judging a movie such as this is how easily and naturally it causes the tears to flow. With part 1, I was in tears with no difficulty at all. The drama was so real and spontaneous. But with the second film you get the feeling they are trying to grab your eyeballs to squeeze every little tear out of them. This makes for very strained proceedings indeed.Everything considered, Wilford Brimley and Doug McKeon DO manage to rise slightly above the material and keep this film from getting a one-star rating but I still think you're better off sticking with the original."
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!,This movie was terrible. i watched number one and two back to back and while I've loved number one since i was a child number two ruined it for me. i advise everyone to stay to number one and NEVER watch the second movie.
2,A VERY POOR SEQUEL!!!!!!!!,"Returning from World War Two, Billy is now a man and meets up with his youngest sister and Grandfather. After getting two new coon hounds{And completely ignoring the first film}, names them, you guessed it, Old Dan and Little Ann. A very bad movie!!!!! It doesn't mention one thing about the first film at all!! And Billy and Rainie Pritchard best buds??? PLEASE!!! And what of the other two sisters and the parents??? One bad movie!!!!!!"
2,Not worth the $5 I spent,"We love Where the Red Fern Grows (2003 version), and we were excited to find this video as the sequel, even though it's much older.It was pathetic. The acting was lousy. The storyline was so jumbled and disjointed. Even my kids agreed that it was not worth the $5 from the movie bin at W--mart. This will be donated to the library.I also noticed that it got the Dove Family entertainment award (said so at the beginning of the movie), but I wasn't too thrilled about the inappropriate kissing between the sister and the friend. In a kids' movie? Really? Totally unnecessary. And I'd like to know what the sister's romance has to do with the story about the dogs? It just didn't fit into the story.What a waste of an evening.Note that I'm giving it 2 stars rather than 1 star because at least there was no foul language and it wasn't necessarily offensive - just lousy."
2,was a bit banged up looking. Bought for friend,"Bought for a friend, not sure if it works yet. Was a bit banged up looking."
4,A dog and master love story,"I found this to be a good sequel to the original story. Two new dogs and new actors and actresses as well, but you would expect that because it is now 1945 and the war has ended. If I had to make a choice the first movie is far the better of the two, but don't take me wrong, this is a good movie too."
5,Great movie!,This is a great classic movie. It is a movie with values. It shows that honor and hard work can make dreams come through. It is refreshing to watch. If kids today watched these kind of movies they wouldn't be out killing kids in school. They would know that guns are for hunting and it is really wonderful to do the right thing. Thank you Amazon.com for selling us this movie.
1,Not as good as the first!!!,"You really don't want to buy this, it will ruin all your memories of the first storyline. END"
3,It's small but nice,"I wanted to give this as gift to someone, but I didn't because I was disappointed when I received it.As someone mentioned, the jewel is very small. I know the actual size is mentioned in the description, but when I ordered it, I didn't understand it actually. It was the size of a finger nail.Another reason I didn't like it was it didn't look as good as the photo. It just didn't. Also the jewelry part doesn't really settle down properly when it is put on the neck;the pendent just sticks out.What I liked about it?-The chain. It was very sturdy. I think I can still use it for something.-The tiny box. I love the purple box that it came with.-The jewel. I love how that green jewel is put properly on the piece. I don't think it would come out randomly."
3,Nice!,"Nice pendant, which arrived with lightning speed! Only drawback is that the bale prevents the pendant from lying flat against the chest, instead, it rocks back & forth. I would have rated this item as four stars, if it were not for that one flaw. The cut & color of the peridot are of decent quality & the sterling silver setting is a very nice, different design."
3,Expensive nail product,This wasn't the best of the best. Burt's Bees for cuticles is similar and actually works better. And is quite a bit cheaper too!
5,Something that works,"I have had ugly cuticles for years. Have tried other Qtica products in the past, but a friend recommended this and it works great. Give it a week or two, but there will be a noticeable difference in hangnails and cuticle hardness. I carry one in my purse and put another on my nightstand."
5,Best cuticle cream I've used.,"It is very thick and sticky, so use before bed or TV time. Best cream to stay on and do what it is supposed to do. Hard to find as stores run out of it quickly."
5,Excellent product but Amazon's price is too high,"I have been using this product for about a year now. We live in a very dry climate, and with regular use it will keep your cuticles soft and attractive. I keep an extra jar in my purse. Last time I ordered through one of Amazon's sellers and the price was less than $12 for two jars. Amazon's own price now is $18.34 per jar. Although I'm usually a loyal Amazon customer, I just ordered the same product (2) from paylessbeauty.com for $14.20 a jar with no shipping charges."
5,Gift for my wife,"My wife has been using this product for many years and it is the only thing she uses on her cuticles. She is a professional esthetician and recommends the product to everyone she knows. Give it a shot, especially at the price online, don't buy it from a salon...unless it's my wife's. ;)"
2,Justin Timberlake in disguise,"This is what happens to trance when it goes mainstream. I guess there is a lot of money in pop music or this is something the Bt always wanted to do. It sounds more like Justin Timberlake with the exception of 2 or 3 songs. Slow songs I just couldn't stomach, they sounded like cheesy boy band ballads. If you are a trance fan or electronic music fan stay away, but give it a shot and listen to some samples if you are into pop. It's amazing that there are over 300 reviews for this album versus around 80 of Tiesto's Nyana cd. Bt is extremely talented, but in this case he produced a pop cd that I couldn't listen to as an electronic music fan."
2,Nothing like what you're used to.,"It seems that every good DJ that we have liked has switched styles on us. This is more like a Pop CD then anything else. Its has great vocals but its not an electronica sounding CD by any means. Piano, Guitar, Electric guitar and drum are used throughout the CD. Stick to his old releases and skip this one."
1,By far the biggest let down of the year!,"Strait forward this CD is garbage. I am a fan of BT if we are talking about MISL, ESM and IMA. This is POP mixed with EGO and together it is CRAP. Also as a slap in the face to those of us with a brain he bastardises a famous Henry Miller word for a song that is far from being worthy.If there were 0 stars I would have chosen thatWill PR people please quit reviewing CD's and misguiding fansTHANK YOU"
2,Not the reason you buy a BT disc,"I'm a big fan of BT, and so I bought this album before hearing even a single track from it. A mistake! It starts out well, but by track 5 it's starting to go downhill, and from track 7 on it's just something unexplainable. I buy BT albums for their beat and this album doesn't have one. Well, the first few songs do, but even then the music is so stop-and-start that I can't imagine playing it at a party for people to dance to. Also, I think BT had a secret dream to be an 80's rocker and this album is the result. Don't believe me? Listen to ""Circles"".(As a follow up, I don't regret buying this disc, mostly because of ""Knowledge of Self"", an unbelievably great song. Overall, I'm just a little bitter about the overall direction of the album.)"
3,wonderful ear candy with no soul,"WOWEE...over 6,000 vocal edits!!! Why did he have to mention that? And why did he have to wear that suit? There is no question that BT is one of todays best electronica ""programmers"" but as a composer his songs lack soul and humility.Check out Hybrid instead. Their music is in the same vibe but has much more depth and soul.VANITY KILLS"
1,I still don't like this cd,"The music is very different, oh yes, to who this is to appeal to. I'm not sure. Perhaps that reviewer a few spots down that believes this to be a masterpiece. ""One of the greatest albums of this century"" or something like that. Wow. Are you serious? So he's not making trance anymore, not true to his genre. That's all ok, but this cd is just hard to listen to. Is there originality to this work? Oh yes, it is unlike anything I have ever heard. The man can't sing, thats fine. Are the concepts and the overall sound of the songs he's writing soothing to the ear? Hardly. I miss the old BT, it's alright, he's gone. Does it matter to me if this review is helpful? No. Is it informative? Yes. Some people might dig this cd but I don't. Five years later and I still don't like it. Don't buy this cd unless your hair looks like his and you should be fine."
5,Awesome ensemble!,"This is a new heading for BT. Quite different from previous material, but still unmistakingly BT. The collaborations are very interesting and make for very enjoyable music all the way up to great grooves. A definite addition to anyones BT collection."
5,Another complete success.,"Even after the reports of having material stolen from him. BT comes back better than ever in Emotional Technology. Brian steps out more this time on his own with lead vocals almost completely throughout the album. Amongst my favorites on this album are; Force of Gravity, Dark Heart Dawning, The Great Escape, scratch the attempt to list my favorites on this album. Each song builds off of the previous one. It is great to see each time BT puts out a new album. His style and energy has picked up great momentum since I first met him at Cyberfest in Northern California '98. Each of his albums is highly recommended for all electronic enthusiasts."
5,BT - Worth the Wait!!,"Honestly, this album took a little bit getting used to because it was so unlike his other albums. But that's BT, you know? You kind of come to expect the unexpected with him. He's always groundbreaking. I can't stop listening to this CD now! Love, love, love this album and love BT even more!!! Thanks for making such inspiring music!!!"
5,amazing album!!!,"i think this is amazing album.i even like it more that M.i.S.L. american version.only thing i miss is more trance music and last 2 songs on the album are little slow but more than that this is a great album and i really enjoy it!!!my favourite songs are :superfabulous,dark heart dawning,the great escape and communicate - song with jan johnston,she has a beautiful voice!!!buy this album today,you gonna love it!!i hope to see BT live in Tampa Bay,FL soon.BT we miss you!!!"
3,where oh where has the bt i use to know gone?,"I'm just not sure about this cd! It's just to POP. I could see this cd being played at a prom from beginning to end. bt started to lose me with the cd ""Movement in Still Life"", don't get me wrong, there are some good tracks on ""MISL"". But, like this his new cd ""Emotional Technology"" both have some good bt tracks. But then there are the tracks that just don't cut it! Seems as if he has taken some steps back, instead of moving forward.I first heard bt's ""Flaming June"", and had tears in my eyes. That was the first track I heard from bt. I bought the cd ""ESCM"", love that cd! Then I went back an bought his ""Ima"" cd, love that cd!! Then came ""Movement in Still Life"", good cd, but I only really like 4 or 5 tracks. Then comes this cd ""Emotional Technology"" this cd is just all over the genre list. Technology I get, but the Emotional part I just dont understand? 3 stars because I'm in the middle on this cd."
4,more of the best BT,"At first skim I was a little disappointed at the increase of new age/electronica and decrease of hiphop and industrial flavor to this album (as compared to Movement). But after a real listen to it, I got hooked. So hooked that it's been in my CD player for days. This album is every bit as good as Movement, yet it is distinct. The style is the same but the songs are distiguishable and varied. If you were looking for more of the BT from Movement, this one is a MUST."
2,Respect the Artist but Disappointed,"I have bought several of BT's creations and this one is lacking heart. The one pop song is kinda catchy but still a pop song. I like Force of Gravity. I bought the cd too quickly without looking into the other songs. There is 1 or 2 more I could listen to but there are now a few that make me cringe. This is not BT. I enjoyed the BT CD, Movement that has a vitality and groove that is not reflected in this CD. I hope he finds his muse again. BT is extremely talented. He seems unhappy in this CD and this quiet sadness bleeds through the music."
2,An Overproduced Mess,"As a huge fan of ""Movement in Still Life"" I was eagerly awaiting this album. I think BT is a excellent songwriter/creator/musician.However, this album seems like a collection of overproduced outtakes. Take the second track, ""Knowledge of Self"" with Gang Starr's Guru. BT's layers on every electronic effect imaginable; fizzles, bubbles, cuts, etc. Instead of releying on BT sence of harmony and beat, the song throws too much at the listener; the song is a chore to listen to. By the third song I'm exhausted.Songs like Circles are downright embarrassing. It's BT's take on Power Ballads, and Alice-In Chains style rock. I lloved ""Movement""s jump in genres, but please BT stay away from cheesy ones. I'm still trying to forget butt-rock."
3,Commercial future-pop,"I'll admit - I was slightly disappointed by this CD. After ""Movement in Still Life"" - which I thought was an incredibly inventive, playful and adventurous sonic trip, this CD seemed a little tame. I should have known by the album's cover art, with BT dressed up like Sean ""P. Diddy"" Combs, that this album was going to be a much more commercial endeavor. However, I still enjoy this album, despite its more pop sensibility. At its best it's sparkly, futuristic, and fun. ""Somnambulist"" is easily the best dance record I've heard in years. ""Knowledge of Self"" continues BT's experiments with hip hop that he began on ""Movement"" ... and it sounds kick-ass. ""Superfabulous"", although a little silly, still manages to intrigue me ... Rose McGowan is not a strong singer, but there's something seductive and tongue-in-cheek about her vocals. And ""Force of Gravity"", featuring 'N sync's JC Chasez, is an effective pop-trance breakup lament."
2,Not your father's BT,"As a big fan of BT's early work (I think I am one of the few people that think Ima is his best), I must say Emotional Technology comes up short. Too much effort is made to create hit songs instead of great music. The songs are pretty good, but overproduced- especially with the vocals. The album would be better if all the vocal tracks were cut. Note: I'm not saying that cutting all the vocal tracks would be best.I guess BT has got to pay the bills though- those Kyma setups are pretty expensive. More power to him."
4,"Catchy, but far from electronica perfection.","We all know that BT knows his stuff, based on more masterful LPs such as ESCM and Ima. This album does display his ability to create excellent beats and catchy tunes, but falls short a little bit:-The lyrics are mind-numbingly cliche. ""come on"" is said in standout track ""Superfabulous"" innumerable times. Don't think about what's being said in these tracks--you'll only be dissappointed.-Why the heck is BT singing?-It's a bit disheartening to see electronica masters such as BT, PvD, and Oakenfold move from good progressive house to more pop-like remixes.If you're a BT fan there's certainly nothing stopping you from still enjoying this LP, but those who are hoping for another ESCM may as well keep looking."
2,BT - Where ya goin?,"I am, and continue to be, a big BT fan. I appreciate his dedication to detail and his desire to do things a little different. That being said, I think that ET let me down. It is too big a deviation from where I think he was going with MISL.Instead of the usual avant-garde approach to digital music making, I found a lot of these tracks to be controlled and too ""popcorn-esque."" I almost get the feeling that this album is more of a resume for BT's production capabilities. If that is the case, then so be it. But I feel like some of the art might be compromised.Of course everyone should BUY this album and support this musician. I especially look forward to some of the upcoming remixes, especially of ""Force of Gravity"" and ""Paris."""
1,how the mighty have fallen,"short review hereive been a fan of bt since i was a teenager and the first album he made Ima - it was such a revelation and an absolute pleasure to listen toESCM came with a further dance and electronica force that i loved, but sadly after that, BT seemed to lose his wayemotional technology is the epitomy of a once talented breaks, progressive house musician losing his way in order to try to appeal to the mainstream to sell more recordswhat a dissapointmentBT mate - you need to go back to stuff like Ima - please"
4,Calming Trance,"I happened to pick this album up right before my flight. While listening to the whole album on my flight, I realized that the time went faster than normal as I was intrigued by BT's style of music. Two Thumbs Up!!!"
2,An experiment that doesn't work,"I bought this album when it came out and didn't like it after the first fews listens. Now I've come back to it after a few months and I still can't like it. BT eschews electronica in favor of a more rock/pop sound and the results are less than impressive. The sounds of this album may be new for BT, but they are not new for music in general. Nothing here stands out. Not one song has a catchy hook (a killer when it comes to pop music). The best track on here is Circles. Somnambulist is not for the hetero crowd and Communicate is by far the worst Jan Johnston song (and I've heard them all except for a couple of remixes).As great as ESCM and Movement were, I do want to see BT evolve, but I would like him to avoid writing BORING songs. And that's really the problem with this album - there is nothing remotely interesting on it.Unless you are a die-hard BT fan, avoid this one like the plague."
3,What's up with BT?,"This is BT trying to be Linkin Park - I am NOT kidding! What's up with that? (don't believe me? - listen to the ""Superfabulous"" track 3).However, besides that, the technology this guy is using is, as always, incredible. The things he does with sound are seriously mind-bending. I must admit though, that I like his not-so-technology-oriented b-sides CD ""Movement in Still Life"" better and would highly recommend it instead of this one.I should also mention that the double ""10 Years in the Life"" CD was a waste of hard-earned cash. Get R&R instead! It is also a collection - plus, it's a NON-STOP DJ mix of your favorite remixes by BT."
3,Not his best work but not bad,"Having only listened to this one time through, I can say with some degree of certainty that it is not as good as MISL, his last album. More of an 80s ballad feel to many of the songs, and his voice has been overproduced and sounds too sugary on most of the tracks. BT's signature ""beeps"" and ""tweets"" are cool but way overused on most of the tracks. However, there are a couple of standout tracks including #2 with Guru and #5. I'm a bit disappointed, as I think he hasn't grown musically as much as I had hoped for an artist who took 3 years to make this album. Also gets demerits for [poor]cover photo. Come back to your roots, Brian! And come play a show in DC soon..."
2,not for me or ESCM fans,"if you like ESCM then listen to the album carefully, it did not cut it for me.... sorry BT"
4,phaseshift,this is such a branch & shift from his past work - and a welcome one. he's growing and i love it!
5,Absolutely Amazing,"BT's previous albums were amazing in themselves, but this one really demonstrates his sonic ability. Instead of keeping with his well-known style for clubby, trancy songs, he shifts into this grey area between deep emotion and bouncing beats. My personal favorites are ""Force of Gravity"" and ""The Last Moment of Clarity"". I think the most amazing thing is that the ENTIRE album is solid -- there is not a single track that I do not like."
5,THIS MAN ROCKS,"this album rocks, it's soothing, and it pumps you up all at the same time. Emotional Technology is a product of true talent and hardwork."
3,The second CD is where it`s at.,"The first CD is pretty weak. With the exception of a few decent tracks, most of them feature acoustic guitars backed up by BT`s electronic production and generic songs about love. Things really start to slow down near the end of the disc, but you`ll probably have lost interest by then and have yourself wondering, ""Man, when is this going to end so I can go back to Flaming June""? Those whole thing feels like a flawed attempt to grab some mainstream listeners.The second CD more than makes up for this! You get Kimosabe, a kick-ass electronic rap song that was featured in Amplitude for PS2 and Need for Speed Underground. Tao of the Machine featuring the Roots, which is a sign that rap artists need to collaborate with electronic producers more often, and a bunch of sweet remixes and previously unreleased songs! Buy this album, but only if youre willing to pay the steep cost of a 2 CD import."
4,very cool,"If you like electronic music mixed with some pop, this would be right up your alley. Personally, I always liked BT and this album is one of their best. If you are BT fan you wouldn't be dissapointed."
5,Emotional Rhythm,"I've always felt you can't go wrong with BT, and here he proves it yet again. I love his tracks 'Shame', 'Godspeed' and 'Never Gonna Come Back Down' (off of the album 'Movement in Still Life'), which all prove he can appeal to a wide variety of electronica tastes. On this album, 'Somnambulist', especially, is a very well-put-together track; the beat is soothing, the vocals are hypnotic, it all comes together wonderfully. And I just LOVE 'Knowledge of Self' =^ ^="
3,what happened to this guy?,"I'm not sure what happened to BT along the way.. perhaps he's trying to be all things to all people, but should probably try to stick with what he knows best.everything --sounds-- beautiful and sparkly and polished, and their is a great attention to sound design, but what happened to the GROOVE?His production skills are second to no one, but he seems to be so obsessed with the technology of music making(he's writing a --book-- about stutter editing?!?!), he's forgotten about the MUSIC.the Male vocals, especially Mr. JC Chasez on from NSYNC on Force of Gravity end up sounding like tranced up Savage Garden.where is the guy that gave us IMA? I want him back."
2,Well......nice effects.,"Very disappointing......after his previous album I expected more growth in the writing department....he got hung up on the production side of the biz and forgot that you have to have a good song before you start producing it...anyway...every song on this record is mediocre....Mr. BT's singing is flat out boring...he should stick to producing boy bands who already have their songs written and can sing..At least you won't get stuck with a song in which you HAVE to look for a hook instead of it jumping at you and not letting you forget it....i've listened to the record numerous times TRYING to like it...but i have to tell you i cannot remember a single melody off it...The production is good and his signature machine-gun stutters are present on every song...there should be more to songs than his ""amazing"" stutter effects which get predictable and bore you to death....To sum it up ...this record SUCKETH."
5,Awesome CD,"I have always loved BT's music. I own everyone of his CDs but I must say that this is one of his best. If you haven't have the opportunity to listen to any of BT's music, I suggest that you should take a listen to this one."
4,The good tracks are great!,"The good tracks on this albumn are worth the price of the CD! Knowledge of self is an amazing song and it's followed by a few others that make you want to move.However, the other tracks are a little to pop for my taste but I guess every artist has to express themselves in his/her own way.If BT makes more songs like Knowledge of self, Look out world, Your cd players are not safe!!"
5,The Next Generation Of BT,"BT has upped the ante with every one of his record releases and this one is no different. This album is way beyond the work Movement In Still Life, especially on the vocal front for BT. This CD is the most amazing piece of work I've ever heard because no two tracks are alike. The variety on this CD is mind-blowing and BT works every genre masterfully. If you have any kind of interest in BT's work, do the world a favor and pick up this album, you wont be sorry. And even if you haven't heard of him before, this may be the best decision you ever make."
5,Great trends in music,"I've known about BT since ESCM. My first face to face encounter with him was when he opened for Crystal Method in Dallas, TX a few years ago.Let me tell you that BT is one of the most down to earth persons that you could meet.Emotional Technology is a great reinvention of himself. In some cultures this is called ""Ryu Pa"" meaning ""Water flows down divided."" Emotional Technology is BT's music development of the techniques of his past blended into who he is today."
4,A good introduction to BT,"If you have never heard a single thing by BT then you maybe be living under a rock, or you just may not realize who this amazing man is. In his current release of Emotional Technology, this is his attempt to get the general public interested in the dance/trance/electronica genre with great success. With songs like ""Somnambulist"" and ""Superfabulous"" he creates catchy lyrics with great dance beats that people can get into with out losing his what he is really known for. There is definitely emotion mixed with the tech in songs like ""Circles"" and ""Animals"" that show you that electronica isn't about crazy beats that may drive a person crazy. The only think missing is the voice of Kristy Hawkshaw that appeared in his last album Movements In Still Life, but over all great album."
3,"Very popish,strange sounding","This is not what I expected after hearing his ""Movement in Still Life""album.In fact,I was very letdown,because he seems to be following the footsteps of Tiesto and Oakenfold.I just hope a great dj like this doesn't end up a victim of bubblegum music.I guess maybe he's trying to change his style too.The best song on this cd is ""somnabulist""Thumbs down,dont get this cd unless your a newbie craving something different"
4,Ok but not the best,"I own just about all his music and this was by far the worst. I thought that he couldn't make a bad album, well until now. Instead of every song being good, there are only two of them that are good. The rest is a little too slow for me to make me fall asleep."
1,BOOOOOOOO What a huge mistake ET was!,"OMG ....how the hech can I even give it one star?Wtf is this pop stuff,and wheres all the good dance music we're used to hearing from him.Whats up with all the experimentation ? ...Dont waste your time and money on this CRAP!"
2,Mediocre!,"I was all excited to see what new stuff BT had come up with,and I must say I was not very impressed.Why the hell did he mix rock with techno?.BIG no no in my book!.that messes alotta peoples heads up for sure.Imagine if you heard hard guitars when u were rollin,boy that would sure ruin it for ya!...""Movement in still life"" was so much better,and less poppy sounding.His music is always changing and he's always trying new elements in his music ... if he'd stick with a particular style,he'd do alright.I dont recommend this one,at least he didnt sell out like Oakenfold did...""cry me a river""wtf?..now thats pop for ya"
1,Emotional Technology/ Sad Creation,"Emotional Technology is anything but emotional. It is not a question of genre, yet musicality, and there is none to be had here. He fails to capture any sense of direction or sound here, and touting that one song had over 6000 edits, is like touting how laborious Liberache's clothings was to tailor, yet was it tasteful....hardly. This is a horrid album by any measure."
1,Rubbish,"Absolute rubbish. Over produced and melodramtic lyrics make this one of the more disappointing CDs this year. Stick with Movement in Still Life, forget this trash.I would give it negative stars if I could."
3,The albums get progressively worse...,"I personally think BT of the Ima and ESCM era is some of the best music. Movement in Still life disappointed me, and so did this one. Instead of the electronic goodness I love, it's much more pop culture-esque, even more so than Movement in still life. If you liked MISL, I would recommend this, but, if you're like me, and prefer BT's older electronic music to this more pop-culture oriented stuff, I'd buy something else..."
3,What happened?,"I'm a big fan of BT, I loved his Movement in Still Life, and lots of his previous works. But what happened to this album??? The first 6 songs are great, I listen to them all of the time, but after Dark Heart Dawning I take the CD out and pop in another one. I'm not saying its a waste of money, I'm just a little disappointed. I was expecting an awesome CD that you will play over and over again when the mood is right."
4,Another breakthrough album from BT,BT has done it again. He has come through with another masterpiece. The production on this album is incredible and BT's knowledge and understanding of composing music shines on this album. It is a nice blend of emotional breaks and 4/4 beats. Vocal glimmer throughout the album creating a rollercoaster of emotion. I recommend this album for anyone who is new to the electronic music scene or any person looking for a cd to help renew their listening habits.
2,BRILLIANT!,"Brian combines the best of a myriad group of influences into a convergence of brilliant, moving, emotional and forceful music. This is Peter Gabriel caliber genius, mixed, sampled and blended together to perfection. Lyrically and musically one of the MOST satisfying albums I have ever bought. AWESOME, and so far ahead of the pack it is amazing. The remixes from this CD will keep me satisfied for a LONG time . Way cool! Way to GO Brian....WAY TO GO!. Keep it up!"
5,BT bucks the trend to make a truly refreshing album,"The first thing I said to myself when I heard the single off of this album was, ""Wow, this sounds so much different than anything else out there."" As the single insert says, Somnambulist has over 6,000 individual edits. BT keeps on redefining electronic music, while so many others churn out yet another lightswitch rave club hit. All I can say is, thanks for being yourself Brian."
3,Blur's (England DVD) Single of Good Song,"Yes, you may ask what does this mean, well since its a DVD from england that means most dvd players in american will not play it. The only real way to watch this DVD is though the computer, hopefully you have a DVD player on your PC. Also this means it will not play on a CD player.The Good news, The B-sides are very good it fits perfectly with Blur's Think Tank album. Also in a way you'll get three different music videos since its on a DVD.Overall: Great Music For The PC Only."
1,PPC only!,"Mac users, be aware: this is a discontinued product with software that only works on PPC Macs! If you have an intel mac, go to the x-rite website to figure the new equivalent product."
2,Very difficult to install on Windows 7 64 bit.,This product was very difficult to install on my Windows 7 64-bit system. It took me nearly 4 hours. It was also somewhat difficult to use. The program assumes you know a lot of color adjustment language prior to using it. There were missing links relating to help on the website.
4,Rear Bike Hub,The hub was a direct fit for the one on my older Pacific mountain bike. Works perfectly at one tenth the cost quoted by my bike shop.
1,Try Sidney Ledson's Teach Your Child to Read instead,"I have been a remedial reading tutor for 13 years and have seen the damage that sight word teaching such as this does--it produces poor spellers and readers who do not enjoy reading and who do not read as fluently as those taught with phonics.Try instead Sidney Ledson's Teach Your Child to Read in Just Ten Minutes a DayTeach Your Child to Read in Just Ten Minutes a Dayor any of Leapfrog's fridge phonics products--start withLeapFrog Fridge Phonics Magnetic SetthenLeapFrog Word Whammer' Fridge Phonics Set, also try Starfall for free.You can read about how the brain learns, dyslexia, and why sight words are harmful at The Phonics Page, and more information about phonics and dyslexia at Don Potter's Education Page and some free phonetic programs such as Blend Phonics that produce lasting reading achievement."
5,A must read for parents of young children,"This book is a must-read for parents of young children. It is the first and the dispositive reference book for teaching babies to read. You may well decide to follow the book's protocol exactly or to do things your own way (or possibly even not at all -- this is a bit of work like anything worthwhile), but this book provides invaluable information on where and how to begin. Even if a parent only takes from this book that babies truly can learn to read (as well as just about anything else you teach them), it is worth a read. The Your baby Can Read DVD series is also a great resource for teaching babies reading, as it the Trebellina DVD for teaching babies music."
4,A great How to book,"There are plenty of HOW-TO books out there the will tell you what they intend to do but when it comes to the how there is no information at all. You are left to your own devices or they point you towards their catalogue or website for further information (read: buy stuff from us).At this point in time I can not tell you whether or not the methods described in the book work or not but I can tell you if you want to know what the method is, how it came to be and how you can proceed to apply it then yes this book is 100% what is claims to be.It tell you exactly where to begin, what you need, how to set it up and so on and so on.I was very sceptical of this book after reading some of the reviews but now i can not wait to try it. Expect another review in a year or so if you want to know if it really works as well."
5,"Great Book, Worked For Us!","We did Doman's program when my child was an infant. He loved it. In fact, doing lessons was one of his favorite activities. We did art, animals, reading, & math. My son was reading & doing math pretty much as soon as he was talking. By the time he was in kindergarten, they made special arrangements for him to be in the 4th grade enriched math class. When he was just barely speaking, and we went to the SF zoo, He could name most of the butterflies in the exhibit. He was also familiar with all the major artists whose cards we had.Now, he's in 10th grade, a straight A student, athlete, and naturally in an advanced program. I'm thankful that I happened to pick up these books while browsing one day."
1,Pure Nonsense,"Krieger uses her arms like magic wands!There is no valid research to show that TT works. The better the research design, the less the effect, if any.Krieger's claim that anyone can sense the ""human energy field,"" aka chakras, was demonstrated to be groundless by a 9yo school girl who tested TT practitioners to see if they could sense her hand when not looking. This well-designed experiment was published in JAMA. No one, including Krieger, has stepped forward to replicate it.Krieger has made a laughing stock of the nursing profession with her attempts to make nurses the equivalent of faith healers."
2,New balance Mens SD 100 Sandal,"They are a little stiff, should have smoother edges around the area you slide you foot in. Not very comfortable."
4,New Balance Quality,"I would rate the quality of this sandal excellent, but would have preferred a wider width, which NB is known for, than what I received. Maybe after I wear the sandals for a period of time they will widen out."
4,its probably not what you think,"I read a few reviews about people *****ing about how this movie isn't ""goth"" enough. GET A GRIP! stop taking it so seriously. The movie shows what its like to be a off-beat teenager in the 90's and the consaquences that may come out of poor decision making. so if you are looking for another ""Crow rip-off"" than your not going to find it here."
3,Interesting view of peer pressure. Mabius stands out.,"Black Circle Boys is an interesting look at how peer pressure can affect decision making and actions. Eric Mabius was haunting and disturbing as the cult ""leader"". The film is a very accurate portrayal of how wanting to ""fit in"" can lead to destructive, and ultimately deadly behaviors. The portrayals of the occult ceremonies were very well done. Low-key, private. A much more accurate portrayal than the typical ""Hollywood"" versions. If you're looking for a statement about teen cult behavior, peer pressure, and just how dark life can be to a teen, look no further than Black Circle Boys. If you are seeking graphic horror and fast paced action, go back to Hollywood cheese. Be sure to watch the ""club scene"". An awesome up and coming band is featured. Rorschach Test is NOT to be missed! Their album, ""Unclean"" is definitely worth a listen."
2,TOO LONG!!! BUT AN OK FLICK...,I think the filmmakers could have shortened this film and put in something to actually scare somebody. It is in the horror genre and shouldn't be...
2,"Not a bad movie, but a waste of my time","Black Circle Boys isn't haunting; it isn't unsettling; and it isn't dark enough. Those are the big problems with this unorginal drama about a new kid who becomes a member of a male cult called the Black Circle Boys. Eric Mabius of Welcome to the Dollhouse and Tara Subkoff of The Last Days of Disco stand out as the psycho leader of the BCB and the hippy chick, respectively. It tries to be original by using males as the occultists, but it just feels like a guys The Craft or Foxfire!"
5,I though the Video was completly awsome,"I though this Movie was the best , my favorite movie by far... When I move back to my Home in Maine I hope to gather enough people to open a club called the Black Circle Kids , and do everything except murder ;)"
5,the best movie,"this movie is so good i can't even find it anywhere. if you come across a copy of this buy it. it is reminissant of american history x, or slc punk in the fact that it is mostly about teen-aged boys comming of age. while the first two movies were aimed at a pirticualy sceen, this will hit home for the rest of us. drugs are bad!! :)"
3,Ahhhhh?,"It had it's moments. There was action which kept the movie from getting too boring, but the bad guy wasn't bad enough and the good guy, well he could of been more believe able. I think the highlight was getting to witness a stoned out D.W. rubbing his belly and acting a littly psycotic. But it was worth a viewing."
3,Not Goth,This is DEFINATLY NOT a goth movie!! the dark undertones of satanism makes it an interesting story. It shows a perfect story of how easily a misguieded youth can be misled. BUT IT IS IN NO WAY GOTH!! : )
5,Great Independent Movie,"this is a great movie, one of my favorite independent films. Dont let the cover fool you its not a horror flick (although it has some disturbing scenes) its more of a drama, loosely based on a true story. Grap some shrooms and enjoy!"
5,LOVED THIS MOVIE~!,"This is one of my favorite movies, it shows true life and was a huge suprise, was not expecting it to be this good, if you were smart and are in the mood for a good ""gothic"" ""black Magick"" movie this is for you!"
3,"Good movie, bad ending.","""Black Circle Boys"" is a good movie and certainly worth watching, but there were a few things wrong. While it's certainly possible that I might have missed something, where exactly did Kyle's parents go? He fights with his mother and then *poof*, they're gone. And the big conclusion...a kick and ""You have no power"", then a shot of Kyle in a pool. So he got back into swimming, then? How'd he clear up everything with the police? While it was a good movie, the ending felt rushed and greatly took away from my overall enjoyment."
5,Best goth movie I have seen in years,"This movie was the most incredible movie that I have seen in years. The symbolism is amazing.Eric Mabius is amazingly HOT,HOT.He plays Shane who is following a path of murder and hate. You all must buy this NOW!!! If you like Gothic music and dark religons you will love this. Love ya Eric Mabius"
1,"Erroneous portrayal of ""Satanism""","This movie was fundamentally flawed. It shall undoubtedly spread the urban myth of the death cult which is incorrectly called ""satanism"" by those who know nothing about it. Satanism is a religion which worships life and the bloody practices of the punks in the movie are not accurate. A very bad movie."
1,POINTLESS,"Eric Maibus and Scott Bairstow have become fine young actors, and even their adequate performances cannot save this dismal, pointless, lurid and sadistic movie. Dee Wallace Stone should be ashamed for participating. Maibus plays the hypnotic leader of a teenage devil cult, with no conscience, morals, or regard for anyone but himself; Bairstow plays the usual ""misunderstood"" teen who looks to the group for acceptance. The script is laden with offensive four letter words in every other sentence; enough is enough. If this is the way teens talk, then steer me clear, folks. There is no heart or soul in this movie, and no reason to rent or buy. NO STARS. C'MON AMAZON, WHEN YOU GONNA GIVE US THE 0 STARS OPTIONS???"
4,great book in great shape,"This book is great for the beginner power yogi/yogini.Baron is inspirational, and is great for the practice.The sequences get more challenging each week.The book is not very deep, but gets to the point.It has good pics to guide you.I give it 4 stars for the fact that the pics are in black clothing which detracts from visual clarity, and lack of deep yoga connection. You can get this after following the book however."
5,OH MY GOODNESS!!!!,"What a book!!!! It took me a day to read...I COULD NOT put it down. Wonderful, Wonderful book. But the sequel is not offered on Kindle...WHAT'S THAT ABOUT???!!! This is such a great book that follows how rape can affect an entire family, church and community. But the best story is about faith, forgiveness and love!!!!"
5,Secrets always have a way of coming out,"I have read a lot of books, I mean hundreds, but this is the first book that has really captured my attention in a very long time. From the moment I picked it up to start reading it, it was hard to put down. There were a lot of moral and religious lessons to be learned in this book. It was so real and heartfelt. I truly felt for each character, especially Elizabeth and her family. While reading, I was able to read what each character was going through. All I can say is that this book is a very excellent read. If you have not read this book, I would highly recommend it."
4,old time ways,"Rehoboth Road was my first time reading by the author, was impressed, readable. I was quite upset that her father did nt beleive that she was raped could not understand how Elizabeth could keep it a secret, overall great storyline and I did purchase the sequel, I will defintely read more by this author..at the end he got what he deserved and much more"
3,An Okay Read,"This book started off slow for me. I could put it down and not pick it up until the next day. After getting maybe half way, it got interesting and it was hard to put down, then the end came before I knew it, and it was disappointing. I knew there had to be a sequel. I'm ordering the sequel, and according to the reviews it is a much better read."
4,God is good all the time and all the time...............,A great book I loved the southern dialect and the vivid descriptions of the South right down to the dirt roads and the Georgia Pines. I loved Ma Dear's strong role in this book. I wished that the story line was a little shorter why did we have to wait so long for the stuff to hit the fan? I don't even see the reason behind it coming out if it was going take over 30+ years. I did love the book and once you start you can't stop Great Read hands down.
4,When one door closes another is opened.,"In this written testimony about the power of God is a wonderfully told debut novel. From the very beginning, you get to know the characters and whether you want to, or not, it won't take long before you choose sides After the most brutal of attacks an innocent fifteen year old proves to have greater strength and faith , than those the communities around Rohobath Road hold in reverence. I must have though of a hundred Bible quotes and sayings. As you sow, so shall you reap probably is the most fitting. People make choices, in this world, and it often seems that those who do the worst of deeds go unpunished. You will not be able to put the book down until it comes to its explosive conclusion and I strongly recommend Rehobath Road to anyone who likes powerful stories, especially if you feel that life has not been fair to you. I look forward to reading any future books written by Anita Ballard - Jones. ."
2,another Carrey movie,"Though rather charming, this is certainly not the best of Jim Carrey's movies ; however the story in it is very original and there is some action near the end, so the result is still somewhat enjoyable. However, like many Carrey movies, this one has several facets, so you can look at it with eyes crying and then laughing, or vice-versa (typical Carrey humor ??).The soundtrack is attractive."
2,Doesn't cut it for me,"I detested ""Something About Mary""....so that should have told me in some way that I would find this film as unentertaining (unless your mind is fully in the gutter). I am a Johnny-come-lately fan of Jim Carry....having started to see his films The Majestic and The Truman show first and working my way back. The Mask was brilliant, and so was Cable Guy for dark comedy. If it were not for Jim and Rene Zelweger, I couldn't have lasted through it. For story line, it sinks, but it is a perfect set up for Jim Carrey. Too bad he couldn't have made it work better. Rene is an excellent actress who is hugely underused in this film. Interesting premise, and my dad loved it, but personally, I expected more."
4,One of the comedy's I seen in ages!,"Thats right, this film surpassed my expectations by a mile and a a half. The jokes are done extremely well, even though many are simplistic set-piece gags, they are executed with brilliance! I found myself laughing at nearly every joke in the movie, and believe me thats unusual for me, I'm a certifiable grouch.Its no sophisticated comedic piece but if you're in need of some belly hurting laughs definately check this movie. Brilliant!"
3,YES IT IS PRETTY CRUDE BUT QUITE FUNNY,I saw this movie and there are sick bits (dog s*!ting on lawn is pretty vile) but it does have its funny bits.Jim carry tries hard but the farrery brothers should reaaly go back to kindergarten school cause thats where they belong.
2,"A few scattered laughs, but mostly predictable","Those Rhode Islanders are back with more crude humor and this time, they've erred. First, the film tries to be a police story with a comedy shell, when it might be better as a romantic comedy. It's already obvious that Charlie/Hank (Jim Carrey) and Irene (Renee Zellweger) are going to fall for each other. Why have a pointless chase story in the mix? But for what it's worth, it did have a few laughs. There is a scene with a dying cow that raises a few eyebrows, and I liked Charlie's three children, who grew up watching Richard Pryor and still live with their father. The ending was a little uninspired, but had a particularly funny moment that I won't spoil. Mostly, it's by-the-numbers Farrelly. I'd only recommend it to die-hard fans of those brothers."
2,another Carrey movie,"Though rather charming, this is certainly not the best of Jim Carrey's movies ; however the story in it is very original and there is some actionnear the end, so the end result is still somewhat enjoyable. However, like many Carrey movies, this one has several facets, so you can look at it with eyes crying and then laughing, or vice-versa (typical Carrey humor ??).The soundtrack is really, really attractive."
3,Enjoyed this now and then,"A friend gifted me this DVD and I must add that I quite enjoy this silly film. Dont get me wrong, I think its a film that has its moments and I do enjoy watching it again and again after every few months. Jim Carrey's acted pretty good and the music that plays throughout the film is simply awesome. I enjoyed the camerawork and the lovely scenes of JC on a bike,country roads and America as a whole. I think its brutally funny in the start,lacklusture yet enjoyable in the middle and overall a winner towards the end. I think the character Hank is really played well by JC.I'd pick this movie over his last flick ""Bruce Almighty"" WITHOUT much thought. Cheers and enjoy the flick :-)"
2,Not Worth Watching,"I really wanted to like this movie, by I didn't. Jim Carrey delivers a mediocre performance while the plot is so dumb and cliche-ridden that it's pathetic. Worst of all, the humor is almost entirely missing. With a few rare exceptions (and most of these scenes you've already seen in the trailer), there are no funny moments. I was left wondering whether this film really was intended to be a comedy. But if it wasn't, then what was it?"
3,Kind of funny,This is the only Jim Carrey movie I've ever liked. I think it is partly due to how much I liked his costar in this film. They were both quite funny and Jim Carrey didn't seem to use so much goofy over-the-top physical humor in this one (which is what makes me not like his films generally).
4,PEE IN YOUR PANTS FUNNY!,"This is one of Jim Carreys funniest movies! He did a greatjob playing multiple personalities. The 3 guys playing hissons, were also great. I saw this in the theater with my10 year old, now he's 15. This movie is definitely not forkids! I didn't realize it at the time. If you want to laughyour ass off, rent this movie, it's hilarious!"
1,Vulgar does not equal funny,"Well, I will admit that I am a big Jim Carrey fan. I will also admit that this movie was not very good. There are some funny parts that are quite vulgar, but overall the movie is a complete waste of time.Jim Carrey tries to find humor in being obscene (yes, obscene even for him), but many of the sick jokes fall flat. There is almost no plot at all (not that I really expected any). This movie could have been about 15 minutes, not 90. For some reason people often find profanity funny; I think that this is often an overseen mistake with many comedy script writers. Not funny. Don't bother with this one. ..."
3,I'm pretty sure this idea came from my script sent to...,"Yeah, I'm pretty sure my script ""World Perfect"" sent to a well known talent agency, gave them what they needed to ""borrow"" yet another idea and run with it. I even stated in the synopsis that Jim Carrey would be perfect for the lead. What a shame Hollywood doesn't set out the welcome mat for new people more often. I mean, how many millions do they need? Gordon Gecko flashback!!!!Think about how many more millions they could make with some new sources of fresh ideas. Can we talk? ""How many more ""Rocky"" movies do we need?!!"" No offense, Sly. KIM"
1,"Me, Myself and Irene",After 10 minutes the movie just stopped and wouldn't continue. I couldn't see the rest of it and no longer had the receipt so I couldn't send for a refund or an exchange.
3,"Me, Myself, And Irene (2000)","This is by far Carrey's worst film.The story is about a man who develops split personalities after his wife leaves him and how he deals with it, but now he's has to escort this one lady to New York while getting chased by some crooked cops. Although the plot for this film seems a bit goofy at times and predictable, it still a pretty good comedy. The narration during this movie is very funny, and it reminds me of those old narrated goofy cartoons if it were R-rated. With so many hillarious scenes like when Jim picks a fight with a small kid in a restaurant to the scene when Jim is in bed with a guy named whitey, it's no wonder why this film is so funny. Overall, this is Jim Carrey's WORST film, but it's still a solid comedy for everyone to enjoy."
2,"What's new about it? A poor remake of ""The Mask""","If you think of it, this movie grabbed the same concept of ""The Mask"" (Carrey's best comedy so far, in my opinion), added some gross elements and voila! Carrey was not the slightest bit innovative for this one: even the voice for Hank (the bad guy inside poor Charles) was similar to the character from ""The Mask."" To me, the best thing of the movie were his three sons. You don't miss much if you don't see it."
2,AVERAGE IDEAS..,"This movie seems to be made of good isolated moments, moments that, unfortunately, are not connected smootly to make a good film... There are good jokes, some fun, but the whole is not good; it's loose, really weak."
4,"Me,Myself & Irene{Vhs}","Me,Myself & Irene VHS- Hilarious yet disturbing, foul-mouthed funny, good laughs, and At the same time makes you angry for what the poor guy goes through in the movie. No wonder. Very Funny although not as good as other jim 's Films and certainly not in my opinion his Masterpieces: Ace 1 &2."
4,CARREY IS FANTASTIC IN THIS VERY GOOD IF TOO LONG COMEDY!,"I think Jim Carrey has made a place for himslf at the top of the ranks of physical comedians. His incredible ability to stretch his face and contort his body is as good as Charlie Chaplin, Dick Van Dyke, Jerry Lewis and all the physical comedy greats in the history of film and television. Teaming up with crude comedy masters The Farrelly Brothers for this very funny if a bit too long comedy film is a good match. I enjoyed this film very much, but it could have been edited a few minutes to make it a better movie."
4,Hilarious,"This is a good non pc Jim Carrey flick. Really funny, the scene the morning after comes to mind. You won't be disappointed you bought it. It is usually had for a really good deal."
1,Don't Bother!!!,"This has to be the worst waste of film to be made is recent memory. What exactly was Jim Carrey thinking? The plot is so stupid and is also very crude and not very appealing for anyone with a sense of morals. Don't bother with either buying or renting this film, it's terrible"
1,Terrible!,"My sister had borrowed this DVD, because of some interesting reviews. It was terrible, disgusting, and after the film, I had a headache, because I was so confused about the plot. Jim Carrey's performance in The Truman Show had impressed me, but I cannot believe how he could actually participate in this movie. His skill is far superior from this. I found it offensive, boring, and not at all funny. There is no content in this movie, except for a few lame, dirty jokes. Some of the scripting was witty, but the directing, the plot, the organisation... was completely underdeveloped. This is not a film produced by some mature, experienced director revealing his skill. It is instead produces by one who has no real experience at all. I would know no film critic who would recommend this."
1,"Nasty, unpleasant movie....what a shame!","I love Jim Carrey's work (along with a lot of people). I lived in the Burlington, Vermont area where much of the film was shot. The river rescue was shot just down the road from my house in Milton, VT. I remember driving home from work and wondering what Rhode Island ""police cars"" were doing in Vermont. Anyway, I was really looking forward to the movie. Usually, Jim's movies are great. This one was terrible. One of the worst movies ever. Absolutely disgusting and just plain idiotic. Not even worth keeping around for the ""views of home"". Could've easily saved the expense and shot the whole movie in the producer's back yard.What a waste of gorgeous location scenery."
3,Runs Out of Steam,"The Farrelly Brother's latest effort has Jim Carrey as Charlie, a happy motorcycle cop who represses years of cruel treatment to the point where a nasty, Dirty Harry alter-ego develops. Both personalities fall for Irene (Renee Zellweger). Hank (the nasty one) has the funniest lines. Does it work? The problem is one of pacing. I roared with laughter for the first half-hour, chortled through the second 30 minutes, and then waited for it to end."
5,"Very, very funny!!","""Me, Myself and Irene"" is the story about a man who is the victim of a split personality. His gentle side, Charlie, is a nervous man who allows himself to be walked over by his friends. His other side, Hank, is a crude, nasty, menace to society. From dunking a little girl's head in water to deficating on a man's lawn, to calling people ""giant, walking Q-tips,"" Hank is a rude but smart man who usually gets himself out of trouble. This is not a movie for young children, having strong sexual innuendo throught the movie, and Charlie's foultalking trio of black children but for midteens to adults, this is good comedy!! Tuck the kids into bed, relax with a bowl of warm popcorn, sit back, relax, and watch Jim Carrey at his best!....... ""Well look who decided to join the party!! Did YOU have fun?!?!"""
3,"Carrey funny, movie lame","If this movie had half a chance of making it, it would only be because of Jim Carrey. He is the only actor that could pull of the mad cap antics needed. But even the brilliance of Carrey couldn't hold this nowhere script together.This movie would have been funnier just as a series of out takes highlighting Jim Carrey. The rest of the movie could have been flushed.His sons who spend the entire movie cursing for no reason could have been much better developed and utilized in the movie. The plot could have been much better adapted to Jim's sense of humor and timing.Like I said Jim is brilliant and that is why I gave this 3 stars. I love watching him work and as long as I only cocnentrate on him the movie is berriable."
4,Better then what most people think......,"Whoa,I thought this movie was going to be horrible..it seems so over looked.But it turned out to be very appealing.Sure maybe some people might not like all the swears,Hank, or the plot but when you go see a comedy who looks for a ground breaking story line?I thought this movie was really funny.Jim Carrey was great.You really belive that he was 2 people.Charlie the guy that get pushed around ALOT from his neighbors to the little girl on the street.Hank is the foul-mouth jerk that hits on Irene and appears when Charlie starts to get mad.Personally I liked Hanks personality better,Charlies was to cute?Heh..I dont know how to put it.Anyways I loved this movie,yeah, its pretty much you typical Jim Carrey movie,but Jim rocks!Hmm..ok just go rent it,its worth it.P.S. Happy Day-Late Birthday,Jim!"
1,Make sure it will play in the USA,I love this movie but i Never got to watch this dvd. Since it will not play in my dvd player so i just threw it away! It wasnt worth the time in sending it back
4,review,"I'm not a shrink, so don't ask me why, but this movie cracks me up in the same way the old movie ""The Out Of Towners"" starring Jack Lemmon does, where everything that could go wrong,does go wrong"
2,Pretty flat.,"The lead actors in this movie (Jim Carrey and Renee Zellweger)were pretty flat and unconvincing, namely in the lines where they are trying to sound empathetic and concerned.The paper mache cow he was beating seemed pretty unconvincing, too.The movie is, simply enough, about a dual-personality character who has conflict with himself, and that's the most of it.More could have been done with it.More, and better."
1,"Me, Myself and a Barf Bag","Quite possibly the most embarrassingly bad movie I've ever seen. I didn't think Jim Carey could fall any farther down on my list of ""actors I least like to watch"" - but darned if he didn't manage to do just that the other night when I tried to make it through this film. Not since ""Ishtar"" have I seen such a criminal waste of celluloid. I don't mind a little mindless bathroom humor once in awhile - but not when it's this blatantly mindless and appears to be the sole purpose of the movie. Renee Zellwegger must cringe when she looks back on her decision to become involved in this abortion. I would even think Carey must flinch a little - and with his record that's saying a lot."
1,"Me, myself, and Irene","I bought this movie on the advice of my fiance' and best friend. It is one of the most inane pieces of drivel I ever started to watch, and a total waste of money!!!!! I didn't finish watching it and never will.Most sincerely,jori"
2,Runs Out Of Steam After A While,"Me, Myself, and Irene is just a one trick pony movie. Yes, Jim Carey pulls off a few amusing scenes. After a while though it gets kind of redundant. How often can you stomache Carey jumping back and forth from an easy going loyal person to a vengeful creep.The plot is truly helter skelteras it seems as if at the last moment that decide to throw in the old double agent routine to make Carey look like the true good guy. Meanwhile, look at all the criminal acts that Carey participated in.The roles of the three African American sons at first is a bit comical. However this sidebar act wears thin with the rapid fire cursing. It is way too stereotypical.A few amusing scenes here and tehre but overall this is a dissapointment. Seek out The Mask or even The Truman Show as these are superior to the medicore Me, Myself, and Irene."
1,"Dumb, dumber and just plain stupid.","This has got to be one of the worst comedies I've ever seen. I could barely watch this whole movie. There were some funny parts early in the movie. But, once you saw them continue to shoot a living cow, that was the end for me. That was totally unamusing and sick. I've never been a big fan of Carrey to start with. Now I'm even lesser of a fan. To me a 6th grader could write a better movie than this."
1,"DISCUSTING, VULGAR, NOT FUNNY AT ALL !!!!!!!","1 STAR BECAUSE THEY WON'T LET ME PUT NONE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NOTHING MORE TO SAY THAN WHAT MY TITLE SAYS !!!!!!!!!!!!! THE JOKES WERE NOT FUNNY, THE COW SCENE WAS JUST DISCUSTING, THE LANGUAGE USED WAS VULGAR............I LEFT THE ROOM JUST AFTER THE SCENE WHERE WE SEE CARREY IN BED WITH A PICTURE OF RENEE NEXT TO HIM, THAT WAS IT I HAD ENOUGH !!!! AND ANYWAY WHAT IS SO FUNNY ABOUT BEING BI-POLAR ??????????????? THIS SICKNESS OR ANY OTHER SHOULD NOT BE USED SO THAT SOME ACTOR CAN MAKE HIS PERPETUAL & SEMPITERNAL NOT FUNNY FACES"
3,Give the guy a credit,"Of course, there's nothing much but a very uncomplicated plot, slapsticks,green stuff & foul language. But you have to give Jim Carrey credit for his vein-popping red-blushing transitions from Charlie to Hank."
1,Disappointed Fan,"This movie is so disgusting, it's hard to put into words. I was extremely disappointed with it. I consider myself a pretty big Jim Carrey fan (I even liked The Cable Guy)but this movie is stupid, offensive, and worst of all, not funny."
1,...,"Too many awful things to say about this movie, the worst I've seen in years. Bad premise, horrible gags, offensive languange and situations, grab-bag music. Without Carrey, this wouldn't have gotten past the studio secretary's waste basket. One star is a handout. Pitiful."
5,Woo Hoo!!,"I thought that Me, Myself, and Irene was a fabulous movie by the greatest filmmakers- the Farrley brothers. The movie is a bout double personality cop Charley Baileygates and just a bunch of wacky other things. He meets Irene( Renee Zellwegger) and falls in love with her. They go on a road trip to get away from the feds. And here is the best part of the movie. At a diner they meet a man that is pale white (forgot what they call them) and Carrey is brilliant as he takes off with crazy jokes about him. I thought a brilliant part of the movie was Carrey's three black full grown sons. They were hysterical and really made the movie shine even more.I won't give away anymore about this fabulous edition to the works of The Farrley brothers. This is a must see movie. Kudos to the bros.HAPPY VIEWING!"
1,Two sides to this review:,"You either really liked it or you didn't:As a person like Hank, I would say that this was funny taking all of the possible crudeness and swearing and everything rude that could be put into a movie and do it with no holds barred.As a person like Charlie, I would say that I would be totally disgusted seeing all the swearing, (every time you breathed no less) sight gags, violence, and total disregard for anything decent in a movie. I'd be totally turned off by seeing this movie and would quit seeing it halfway through.Too bad I'm more like Charlie."
4,"Crude, but funny...","Jim Carrey is at it again in his first comedic film since his dramatic turn in ""The Truman Show"" and ""Man on the Moon"". He plays a cop with split personalities. Both sides of his personality fall in love with the same woman, which causes some problems. This movie is hilarious, but some of the jokes and scenes are pretty offensive at times. The language is also very raw. Not for everyone."
5,Another classic from the Farrelly geniuses....,"By now you've probably read reviews of this movie saying it wasn't as funny as Theres Somethng about Mary. This to me was completely untrue. From beginning to finish, this movie was filled with comic genius. Renee Zellweger really put up a great performance, but by far his three sons were the most enjoyable. Jim Carrey put on a good performace, but I will say this was not his best. The Farrelly brothers have done it again I say. But since this is a Farrelly brothers movie, all those lovable disgusting parts are in. I'm glad this comedy came out because i havn't seen an intelligent yet stupid comedy since Theres Momething about Mary"
1,The Worst Movie I've Ever Seen,This movie was so bad that after 15 minutes my husband (a huge Jim Carrey fan) wanted to leave the theatre. Don't waste time or energy on this movie. The gags were not funny and the story line stunk. I'd give this negative stars if I could - it was a waste of money.
2,bleh,"The movie itself is a snoozer. There's a good amount of physical comedy, but the story just went nowhere. However, the running commentary is hilarious! When the commentary is funnier than the movie, you know the movie is pretty bad."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"You would better spend your resources stoping cat jugglers or donating your organs to science (before you die). Synonyms for this movie are INSIPID, VAPID, JEJUNE, and BANAL. Jim Cary has outdone himself in his ability to insult and abuse common decency. The entire story line is shallow and as imature as the humor. If a list of morally offensive movies were made, this would be in the top ten."
2,eewwwww gross!,"What was Jim thinking when he agreed to do this movie?? I have been a BIG fan of Jim. I loved his comedy in Ace Ventura, dumb and dumber, Liar liar, and so forth, but this movie really was terrible. It did have some funny one liners, but there were way too many gross scenes. Not for young viewers, your parents, grandparents, or any date that you might want to impress. Over all, you wouldn't miss much if you never watched this movie. Very disappointed."
1,The phrase LOSER comes to mind.,"What a piece of crap movie. Stupid beyond stupid, no real plot and so called comedy bits tossed in here and there that had no real attachment to the story line. I don't mind rude langauge in a movie, this movie has gone to far. Cussing for the mear sack of cussing. MF this and MF that with no real point and to why it was needed. Lame with no story ... don't waste your money. Jim Carrey seems to have lost his edge, no bad movie after another. Maybe I'm getting old or more likely Jim carrey's gag are old and worn out. Loser film, loser."
1,so silly it's not funny,"you watch a Jim Carrey movie with the expectation that it's going to be silly, stupid and funny. If that's your type of humour. But I found this movie so dumb. I found it really boring and not funny at all. Infact it bordered on disgusting. There was too much swearing for my liking. And Jim Carrey's role was one of his worst I've seen. Even dumb and dumber was more funny.I was so disappointment. alot of people have asked me - what did I expect. well I expected something better than this."
3,Shannon Whirry Is Awesome,"Erotic film star Shannon Whirry has a bit part as the beautiful mother. As Charlie (aka Jim Carey) begins his no-holds-barred attitude, he approaches Shannon as she breast feeds her child while sitting on a park bench. Unabashedly, Carey removes the child and he begins to feed off the ampley endowed Miss Whirrry. It' amazing how Carey almost swallows Shannon Whirry!"
5,Jim Carrey is fabulous,"If change the performer of this movie's leading role to another actor, I would like to rate this movie a popular one without funny. Jim Carrey made it different. Really he is a great performer who seems to be able to play any role funny and attractively. This movie tells you a story of a Rhode Island state trooper, also is a schizo, who was performed by Jim. Like other Jim's movies, a chain of laughing stories made up this one, also with a little bit rude language for making up the characters. All these gives you an opportunity to enjoy a schizo, two men-Charlie and Hank, be in love with the same woman. This movie is so comically entertaining that I just feel it is too short for seeing. And I am just eagerly looking forward to the next masterpiece of Jim Carrey. Hilarious!"
1,"Me, Myself & Irene is really a bad movie.","I love Jim Carrey. I love everything that he does. I was so disappointed in this movie. I hope that he never works with the Farrellys again. I wish that I could rate this movie with an L for ""La-hoo-za-her"" because that's what it was - a big loser."
3,The Triplets Are Hilarious,"I am not offended easily, but this movie is very offensive. The triplets make it worth watching. I wasn't offended by their cursing. To you people who were offended by their cursing, go get yourself a Disney movie! You should notice that this movie is rated R! I think the triplets were hilarious, but this movie is demeaning to albinos and women, and some of the things in this movie are just plain not funny. The Farrely Brothers need to learn that sometimes just because a movie is trying to be shocking does not make it funny. So I give this movie three stars because of the triplets."
5,highly entertaining-not only a comedy,"I make it short as usualIf you like Jim Carrey's humor than you cannot go wrong with this movie.I dont know if he got an award for that, but HE SHOULD. Jim is as great as usual. Unbelievable how he is in charge of his body. He plays two roles in one :-)Jim C. is doing such a great job and he should have been awarded with an oscar for comedy.This movie is not only a comedy, but a nice fun cop movie.Just get it and enjoy."
1,Disappointing,"This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The movie's only saving grace was the 3 sons, they were hilarious. I rented it for free from the library. Don't pay to see this one."
1,You have got to be kidding,This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I can't believe people thought this movie was funny. The script was total garbage and it was the usual Jim Carrey one man show routine. The only funny part of the movie was the cow scene - and as far as I'm concerned - the cow stole the show. The movie just dragged and enough was enough. I kept thinking that it would eventually become funny - but it never did. I always wondered why there were so many copies on the Best Buy shelves - now I know.
3,A Real Mess He Got Himself In For...,"This was not your typical Jim Carrey flick; here, he pretended to be a Phode Island highway patrolman. It was actually a nasty movie: ""my dad says you're a joke"" by a foul-mouthed little girl. Charlie had to take the law in his own hands as everywhere he looked, people made fun of him. Hank, his alter ego, is the aggressive part of Charles who avoids confrontations at all costs. He's treated as a mental patient, i.e., ""Close your eyes but keep your mind wide open.""There was too much vulgar language in the homogenous population, white mothers with black children. If this is t he type of employee the highway patrol has in Rhode Island, and the Knox city police who show no respect or integrity are the same type of character, then this country is just an immoral entity full of evil and demonic police ""officers."" The kid in the restaurant had rude manners. There just was nothing funny about multi-personality. It was total insanity."
1,Me Myself And Irene,"The main problem with this product was that it was horrible quality. The DVD was apperently scratched in many places, something that was not mentioned in the description, and while watching it would skip around throughout the whole movie."
2,Disappointing,"The movie relies too heavily on Jim Carrey to carry it off, rather than have a real plot. The gags are lame. The cotton mouth scene was not funny, nor was shooting a cow 6 times in the head, strangling it, shoving his fingers in its nostrils and having Irene kick it, funny.Although the movie had a good end, it was an overall disappoinment for me.The 1 star is for Jim, of whom I am a fan, and the other is for the makers, for effort."
2,Nothing Eye-Popping About This,"I bought this hoping to get the IMAX experience. I didn't expect perfection, but I did expect something better than this. For starters it's not 3D...more like 2D.5 because the images don't pop out of the screen as you would expect. If you're watch a 3D movie, yes it gives the movie more deminsion, and a somewhat 3D effect, but nothing comes out of the screen. As far as regular non-3D movies, which it promises to convert into 3D...what a waste! It adds almost nothing. I hoped it would work on the 3D versions of Shrek and Spy Kids, but it did not. And if you want this thing to have the ultimate home theater experience wouldn't you want it to work on a big screen TV? It doesn't. I give it 2 stars for a nice try, but the technology isn't there yet...maybe one day."
2,Its OK for the price,"First of all you need to play with buttons to get is right. As lot of people says, it doesn't convert 2D to 3D as it should, and you can't see 3D effects out of 2D movies or TV shows, it kind of take you in a view where it looks like you are watching it from a window without little 3D effects. For the Price I am happy because I got lot of 3D movies with it and it works on 3D movies, please note that not all 3D movies will work with these, only 3D movies that work with shutter glasses will work with those. Spykid and other movies will not work with these you need those paper glasses with those."
3,Contains several urban legends; don't believe every word,"In just the first half of the book, I found 5 urban legends being presented as fact (e.g., that ancient thing about ""bite the wax tadpole"", the one about Africans thinking that baby pictures on baby food meant the food was made of babies).Granted, the latest update was in 1999, but the facts should have been verifiable and verified even then.Take the anecdotes with a grain of salt."
2,Empty examples,"""Once upon a time there was a company which...."" and ""it once offered a product which's name sounded badly in another language"". Unfortunately we do not know the details. Such examples are not so often but they exist in this book and one can harbor doubts whethere they are true. Some of them may be just made up. Therefore the value of this book may be not so great."
4,Learn by laughing,"If this is the book I think it is, first published in the 80's, it is the only business book that has ever made me laugh out loud. Over and over again.Don't be put off -- it _is_ a serious business book, and it treats the issues in a systematic fashion. But it is well-written, too, and the examples the author uses to make his points will have you chuckling."
1,Poor service,"Very slow, never received my product, and never heard back from the seller. I would not recommenced purchasing anything from this seller"
3,200k BTUs = 4 minute T-bone,"Awesome amount of BTUs; but be prepared for some home tune-up work.The cast aluminum burner had paper scraps lodged inside. The gas orifices needed reaming with an electric drill. A 3.1mm or 7/64ths inch bit; from memory. The upgrade from 185k BTU to 215k BTU results from stepping up from a 20psi regulator to a 30psi regulator. The 30psi regulator comes with a higher quality stainless braided hose.Do NOT expect any customer support from the distributor in Mississippi. Phone call requesting tech support was never returned.Running at full BTUs, you can grill a thick steak at under three minutes per side!. Worth the trouble. I recommend it."
1,DREADFULL TYPICAL VH1 MTV HYPE,real diva's can sing. Diva is usually in reference to an operasinger or a ... circuit female singer... All of which can actually sing. Diva is alsoin reference to people who paid their dues and been around a long lomg time. That have done many many different types of music. Such as a real diva being Linda Ronstadt. So they should have just refered to it as greta modern pop singers of our day. The diva shows are shameful... Whitney can't sing gospel. Shania has a couple songs. Celine is faking itshe can't hold a note and has zero style and usually ruins other classic songs. Aretha never had soul since she just screams and their is zero feeling to her music. Though she was lucky to have great people around her feeding her good material. Mariah is a decent singer and has alot of potential but she wants to just sell looks instead of quality so you can chalk her up as a bad imatation of DEniece Williams and Minie Riperton who had syle and could actually sing.
4,Lot's of Sing-a-long Fun!,This is the type of CD you can out in and have alot if fun singing along with. Each song is belted out by these fabulous ladies. The only downside is having to listen to the self -aggrandizing chatter in between songs.
5,they're awesome...but Shania's the perfection made woman!!!!,"well, I have only one thing to say:this CD is absolutely a jewel!!!!!!I really am impressed with the voices of the divas, they're excellent performers... but I must say, the best of the divas is SHANIA TWAIN!!!!! please, listen this voice! girl-power kind, emotional, simply wonderful!!!! maybe she has not the history of years and years like the others, but she was born when God was inspired. She looks young, so pretty (charming face, and what a body! I wish I have it!), and please... ooh these songs!!! are simply out-of-this-world! I wish I have written her songs!!!! and she knocked the other divas with her ""speech"". Buy the video. and don't forget Shania's the best!!!!!!!"
2,"Very, very undergrad","A graduate program had the audacity to use this as a text. I would say this is a solid community college level text, or perhaps an intro to communications text for a 4 year course. Most definitely not a graduate course level text. Don't expect to gain any particularly new insight into communication if your grad school assigns this text, although you could probably expect an easy A."
3,A Small Touring Exhibit,"""Human and Divine: 2000 Years of Indian Sculpture"" is the catalogue of a small British touring exhibit (year 2000; venues only in Great Britain) of Indian sculptures. The exhibit consisted of 75 pieces in total. The selections printed in this catalogue, most of them of reasonably good quality, were well-chosen to include examples from various regions and time-periods. However, the small size of the catalogue (only 80 pp.) seems to have defeated the best intentions of its organizers. Only 43 of the 75 touring sculptures are pictured, and insufficient space was allocated to their description.Erratum: On page 60, the meditating Jain saviour (catalog #65, photo p. 64) is identified correctly as Rishabha, but for the wrong reason: his vehicle is the bull, depicted on the fold of cloth in front of his throne, not the lions which are depicted beneath his throne."
5,A warm and touching Christmas collection!,"A long overlooked vocalist from the 70's, 80's and 90's, Kenny delivers a tastefully produced and performed December/Christmas collection. The songs are beautifully arranged and truly capture the essence of both the Christmas and winter seasons. A delightful addition to your Christmas library!"
5,"""December"" by Kenny Loggins",I absolutely love this album by Kenny. It is far from the ordinary Christmas time music that is usually heard in December.
1,Too Difficult To Use,"For a patient recovering from heart surgery, the pillow is too difficult to get ""into"", meaning they cannot pull themselves up to get against the pillow."
3,Not-so-special Edition,"I've loved this movie since I was a kid, watching on late-night TV, but is there anything more annoying than having a vertical line continuing through every scene? How they can release a ""special edition"" DVD with that line and a series of black and pink spots popping up periodically. Extremely dissappointing. I wonder if the print is just as bad on the double-feature DVD it is also on."
5,One of the best worst movies ever,"This was a fanfreaking tastic badly made movie. The kids (10 and 8) and my wife all watched this and everyone laughed, hysterically. The best possibly are the police men who disappear in the sand, the shot of them looking at the camera, throwing their arms up and then falling, PRICELESS. The appearance of all brainwashed people lags between a hangover and wicked constipation, another hysterical review.The actual martians, not the leader in the orb, are easily spotted by bad costumes and their zippers as they run in the ""tunnel""BEST OF ALL, weatch out for smart kids who figure out saucers ans alien weapons in mere seconds...look out Mars!!"
4,Better Than I Remembered,"Having seen this movie on television when I was young, I knew how it was going to end. But I didn't mentally get all the stuff leading to the conclusion back then. With the passing of time, the film has more of a Twilight Zone feel to it, with the threats from ordinary-looking folk being more menacing than the alien threat. I find it interesting that changes in society have made this movie more effective; would any film maker today allow a scene in which a father smacks his young son? Some may find the ending gimmicky, as I once did, but now it seems to have the right amount of ambiguity. There are some very good effects and memorable scenes in this film, and the collector's booklet accompanying the movie is fine."
1,"Great Classic, But...","I'm 56.And this movie terrified me when I saw it. That scene where David's father goes up the hill past the tree to the sand dunes is classic and pure gothic. For days I looked at the back of the necks of all the grown-ups for a little ""wound"". Especially my friends grumpy old fathers! And the little girl and the set fire in the basement was they stuff of nightmares.But people should not mess with great classics except to ""re-master it"". And I understand from reading one of other reviews here that someone bought the copyright and messed with it. How sad people feel they have the right to mess with a movie that touched so many people.We kids liked to be scared and this movie and any monster movie was great to me. My Dad popped pop corn and our den was a gathering place for up to a dozen neighborhood kids on a Saturday night. But then....we grew up... only to realize there are real monsters."
2,"Great Movie,Horrible DVD","Invaders from Mars is a great classic science fiction movie from 1953.This 50th Anniversary Special Edition comes with some nice artwork and a nice booklet but the quality of this DVD is just aweful.A lot of these old Sci-fi movies are certainly not in pristine quality condition and come with some flaws which is OK and acceptable but this movie is bad from start to finish,faded,grainy,dull and scratchy all over.Shame on Image Entertainment for even releasing such a poor copy.Why even bother,it's no better than the $5.00 VHS copy I bought 15 years ago.As far as I know there is no decent copy of this movie available.Hopefully someday this classsic movie will be restored and released as it should be.Hopefully!!"
5,A wonderful trip down memory lane!,I saw this movie on TV when I was a kid--so long ago that I never knew the movie was in color until I bought this DVD! What a great trip through time seeing it was for me. And having the British cut of the film was an added bonus that I appreciated very much.
3,Beware the Fiftieth Anniversary DVD Edition,"I think everyone interested in scifi films, especially films of the fifities, remembers this classic. I have a VHS version, but when the Fiftieth Anniversary DVD came out, I couldn't wait to get it. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!!The DVD is made from the original 35mm print, and I guess the historians did not want to tamper with it in any way, or didn't want to spend the money. What you get is a scratchy, jumpy film with more interference lines than you used to get on TV before cable. Stay away from this version. It usually costs more, and it's a waste of your money. The imperfections ruin the enjoyment of seeing one of the all-time classic scifi films. The British version included on the disk is of equal ""quality"". We would have been better served if they included a restored version with the original print."
2,A Poor Quality Print,"Really a shame. With 20+ dollar price tag on this disc, you'd think that there would at least be some sort of warning about the poor quality of the sound and picture. Image Entertainment usually does much better (check out the excellent ""Rocketship X-M"" for comparison). As another reviewer has pointed out, it's hard to believe that this is as good as it gets as far as a restored print. 3 stars for the movie and 1 star for the picture/sound."
2,"Great movie, poor DVD","This is one of those classic SciFi movies that scared the 'bgeezus out of every kid who saw it in the 50's/60's. After viewing the spectacular anniversary edition DVD of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" I expected a comparable treatment of ""Invaders from Mars"" (especially for the price). But no ... the image quality of this Image Entertainment DVD is ....: scratches, blips, and poor color rendition abound. An undergrad film major could have done a better post-production job. Maybe that's who Image Entertainment employs? I see the company's Director recently resigned -- hopefully in shame after seeing their effort (or lack thereof) on this project. Great movie, but buy it on tape and pocket ten bucks..."
2,Poor quality DVD,"Despite being touted as a ""brand new digital transfer"" this DVD is suprisingly bad. I don't mind films showing their age with a few artefacts popping up now and then but this is just ridiculous. The sound is also only barely passable. Buyer beware."
3,Poor transfer.,I was looking forward to seeing the movie as i only saw some trailers of it.It looked pretty good but when i played it i was really disapointed.The transfer is terrible.I dont know how this can be a special edition.Its more like the crappy edition.Someone must have a better print of the film.I wish it would be released again but with a better quality print.This is an example of how we get ripped off sometimes buying something like this only to be let down.
2,gets stuck,"I remembered watching this film with a girlfriend so I wanted to get it. It broke up and got stuck in places and I winded up just turning it off. I was very disappointed with the digital format. I still love the film, but guess it is too old to load properly on a dvd."
2,Form ruins substance,"While the term ""classic"" is thoroughly overused to describe movies, ""Invaders from Mars"" is definitely a sci-fi classic in the truest sense. Sadly, this version of the movie is simply atrocious. As another reviewer here correctly stated, ""What you get is a scratchy, jumpy film with more interference lines than you used to get on TV before cable. Stay away from this version."" I found the poor picture quality so distracting that it ruined the experience of watching the film."
3,Must agree with others on picture quality,"I must agree with the others that the picture quality is lacking. Still, I enjoyed seeing this movie again. A little more corny than I remember. 3 stars are due to the picture quality."
4,A Surreal Nightmare,"This film simply does not get the credit it deserves. Often written off as yet another cheesy '50s alien invasion movie, Invaders from Mars is SO much more. This is a brilliantly directed glimpse into one little boy's nightmare, as his parents and almost everyone else around him seems to become overtaken by Martian body-snatchers, and maybe even worse - no one believes him! This is a genuinely terrifying and nightmarish descent into madness that left me with chills days after watching it. Look past the some of the corny acting and dialogue and focus on the real psychological meat of this film, because there is a lot to mull over here."
2,Really Disappointed,"I was torn between I hate it and I don't like it. I actually saw this film in the theater when it was first released and loved it. The quality of the film is just awful with colored, streaking lines throughout every scene. I am so disappointed."
2,Don't believe the HYPE!,"Excellent film - bad DVD. ""This Special Edition"" features a print which is sub-standard, so better beware. It's fun to have the British version of the movie on this DVD - nonetheless a little bit more care concerning picture quality would have been nice for 50th birthday presentation of this landmark movie."
4,"TERRORIZED AT TWELVE, SMILING AT SIXTY","I am So happy to have found this film. When I was little I saw this and couldn't sleep all night . I was terrified. My mother actually sat up with me and gave me a glass of milk. LOLNow I find this just plain fun to watch. The funny part is how the Army comes out in their TANKS (along with their theme song)after a few people have been ""taken"" by UFO's. Not exactly how the Army would act now! They would say, ""Case Closed or Else."" File under ""Classified.""The acting is really good. One policeman, if you look closely, is the doctor on Gunsmoke! Doc whatshisname. Oh, these tanks are funny."
3,Of its Time!!,"This film can serve as a metaphor for absurd remakes of the genre. Sure the film in 1953 was on a tight budget, so were the Val Lewton films over at RKO in the 40,sNevertheless what must be considered here is the cinematography and montage. The final sequence with Jimmy Hunt running, his face is superimposed with a recap of the events of the film. Still this montage is terrific and disturbing...but not unusual when you consider that the films director was a king of ""montage"" William Cameron Menzies.Even zippered uniforms cant hide artistry."
5,This film is a True Classic!,"This film is a true classic! It scared me half to death when I was a kid, and my best friend still does an excellent job of making that bubbling sound when the aliens boil and dissovle walls in their paths. I absolutely love this film. Yes, I know it was made around the time of the cold war paranoia, but I think it has more to do with wierd aliens and wierd sounds and science fiction than fear of any human political systems. You have to buy this film if only to see that cool little guy in the glass bottle with the shifty eyes."
3,Seemed Better 1st Time Around...,"I remember being terribly frightened of this movie when I was a kid. Scenes such as the people falling into the hidden hole in the sand near the bridge, and of adults who were not the same people anymore scared me silly! So during my relentless pursuit of this video, I told my wife and kids that this was a great movie and it would be worth it once I found it.. and finally I found it! Then we sat down to watch it and I became the object of derisive laughter. Oh, well... it was scary back in those days. If you look at it from a child's perspective, it is indeed frightening. But being an adult jaded by all the special effects in the movies nowadays, plus subject matter that knows no bounds, I guess this movie seems pretty silly now. Actually, the some of the special effects in this movie are pretty hilarious - take a look at the outfits the aliens wear (looks like they were crawling around in a septic tank) and their multi legged master."
5,Awesome old movie,If you want a part of our past to return and see an older low budget movie....this is the one for you....brought back memories of my childhood...Wow...Invaders from Mars in it's original version...I loved it! Great late night popcorn in hand kinda movie when you want to see a simple movie without making your mind think too hard on the plot...
2,"hmm, i've seen better","well this seems to be one of the first bodysnatcher type movies, so it has its originality. the paranoia and fear of the kid when no one will listen is relatable too. for those points i gave it a 2. however the ending makes no sense, and i particularly don't like it when a movie ends with someone waking up, because either way it wasn't real to me anyway. the remake of this was awful. i wouldn't dare call this scary though, however, it has its originality in that it was one the very first and has since been copied in hundreds of ways. I wouldn't recommend it though."
1,"Unfunny, Uncampy Garbage","Don't mention this waste of celluloid in the same breath as The Day The Earth Stood Still or even Creature From The Black Lagoon. This is almost what Ed Wood might have made with a bigger budget, but the hammy, campy flourishes that are so endearing in Plan 9 or Bride of the Monstor aren't there. The acting is wooden, the dialogue is straight out of classroom films, and the special effects worse than Wood's. Only Robot Monster comes close to this bottom-rung effort and at least Robot Monster had some interesting beefcake. IFM should also get the Stock Footage award for its use of WW II army footage as the film plods along. Yeesh, this film is pure crap! Makes me want to wash my eyes out with Gilligan's Island reruns!"
3,This sared the living daylights out of me as a kid,"It's a 'B' movie through and through. So the acting, the set and, yes, the quality of the dvd transfer is tainted from the beginning. But it was the one movie that scared the living daylights out of me as a kid. I had nightmares after viewing this one. I didn't buy it because I thought it was a quality movie or for the storyline, though, honestly, forty years later it does have some high points. I think the 'head' of the alien one of the best, especially back in those days. One feels the emptiness of the moment, not because of creativity and production, but because of the sparse set. It's bleak and barren, and actually works if one has the necessary creativity within one's imagination.I have no complaints on the quality of this movie or on the fact that it lacks in other ways. I'm just glad it was there to scare the living daylights out of me as a kid, and that I can own it today and have a laugh and enjoy a moment of my childhood."
4,Zippers from outer space!,"I have read countless reviews of the corny costumes with zippers, what is amazing about the movie is the great acting by the boy and the fact that he finally got some adults to believe him!"
3,seminal so-bad-it's-good scifi classic,"Invaders from Mars came out in 1953, at the height of Red Scare paranoia, and it is both a product of its time and a seminal film that influenced future scifi/horror movies. When a young boy sees an alien spaceship land in a field, he finds that not only don't most adults believe him, but they start acting very strangely....The alien costumes are laughable by today's standards, but young kids still get a thrill out of this classic, and many elements are still effective. The music is very good and the atmosphere of tension created with extreme close-ups, for instance.One problem is the acting. Those who have been probed by the aliens act wooden, but sometimes it's difficult to tell the probed actors from those who are just plain bad! The female lead is the exception in an otherwise goofy cast.Check out the 1986 remake with Karen Black too!The DVD includes the original US as well as the alternate British version, the trailer and over 100 stills."
2,"blah movie, even worse quality dvd","The movie itself starts off okay with all this spaceship business and the mysteriousness of what happened to the kid's parents. But things go downhill when they introduce the army and fill the movie with tons of stock footage of tanks moving here and there. Too much time watching tanks move, or army people scuttling about.Anyway, the biggest complaint is the DVD itself. I have hundreds of DVDs, and this one is by far the worst quality DVD I've ever seen. The video quality is full of grain and spots and lines - just plain horrible. Buyer beware."
4,Is that you dad?,Pretty good sci-fi from the golden age but not as good as some would want it to be. The print was ok considering the age of the negatives and the sound was average. Good color and all in all a pretty good slice of american cheese under the shadow of the cold war.
2,The movie is as I remembered it,from watching on TV in the 60s. No surprises there and I'd rate it a 4 on that. The quality of the DVD is abysmal though. I'm going to assume that the production values of the original movie were at least adequate and that no care at all was taken in transferring it to DVD. Zero for the disc itself.
5,great 50s sci-fi,Remember when you were little and tried to convince adults of something but were dismissed as just a silly kid with a wild imagination? That's what the 12-year-old hero is up against as he tries to warn of aliens putting implants into humans to control them. Weird camera angles and distorted sets add to the paranoia. Only 78 minutes long because it was made in 1953 when double features were the norm.
3,Invasion From Mars a Blast From the Past,A charming sci-fi piece from an earlier age. I was glad to get a chance to finally see it. The kid in the movie reminds of the kid in Family Affair. The movie contained all the stock characters including a hard bitten general and a pipe smoking scientist. Worth a loo.
1,BE CAREFUL!,"I was very pleased to see that this old classic was released on DVD. Despite it's age, the movie holds up nicely, although corny compared to today's movie technology. If you think that you are purchasing a ""pristine"" copy, be careful! When I pay twenty bucks I expect a nice crisp copy. Not so here. Scratches, pops,blips, etc. What a disappointment. The picture is not that clear.I am very sad that Image has promoted this DVD to be better than what it is. Hopefully, someone else will get ahold of it someday and restore a true classic."
1,Poor quality DVD,"I truly wanted to add this DVD to my collection of classic Sci-fi movies. However, the transferance of the film to DVD was poor. I regretted returning the DVD. I have not yet replaced it. But I will once I can find a DVD that is viewable."
2,Different,"I have been using Almay Mascara for years. I needed some and ordered it online. However, this is different. It SMELLS, irratated my eyes, and flaked off. Horrible. It is not like the ""Almay"" Mascara I buy in the store. ?????I will never order this product again."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this product from the store last week which is why I an here now looking for something better. What a waste, I feel quite embarrassed walking around with flaky bits of mascara around my eyes and sure enough, every time I look in the mirror these is more. If does nothing for my eyelashes other then make them black, no volume, no shape, nothing. Going to return it ASAP"
1,Disappointment,"I was extremely disappointed with this book. It is definitely for teenagers (especially the romantic type). An assumption that it was the same as the William Peterson film, The Staircase, was incorrect. The only similarity was the staircase being built by a ""mysterious stranger"". Oh, well, as an adult, perhaps I should be a bit more careful in book choice and look inside before purchase."
5,!!! !!!Billy Joel is Awesome!!! !!!,"This CD is my absolute favorite! ""Scenes from an Italian Restaurant"" is my top most favorite song next to American Pie! It's best to listen to this CD with the volume turned up really loud (but not too loud) and just have a ball! Speaking of Balls, S.I.R. is a great song to dance to! This is great, meaningful music-ya gotta love it! I'm only 15 yrs. old and I'm hooked :) !"
5,"I f you like classic Billy Joel, you'll love this CD","Billy Joel, The Stranger, contains some of Billy Joel's greatest classic hits. You will find songs like Movin' Out and Scenes From an Italian Restaurant. the CD has songs for your every mood and occasion. It really is a great buy!"
4,Billy's Best,"This is Billy Joel's best album in my opinion. The songs I enjoy the most are ""Movin Out(Anthony's Song)"",""The Stranger"",""Scenes from an Italian Restaurant"", ""Only the Good Die Young"", and what is in my opinion one of his most honest songs ""She's Always A Woman To Me"". Truthful lyrics like these are absolutely spellbinding to my ear. Even the great Bob Dylan, whose song called ""Just Like A Woman"" can only play second fiddle to this song. This song is direct and pulls no punches. It should be the musical anthem for male freedom and women's liberation. Of course the song this album is most famous for is ""Just The Way You Are"". Which was a huge hit in the 70's."
4,No Stranger? Get It,"Billy Joel is kind of my guilty pleasure - He's one of the most revered musicians or at least very popular of today yet I never quite got him. Until more recently when I decided there was a time I really liked some of his tunes, the years of 77-84 really spring to mind. I had a few of his cassettes when I was little and I always liked the late 70s, early 80s Billy songs and this is the album where I remember paying attention to him.This is the first remastered version was released a few years ago and it was only $8 so I bought it in a heartbeat and I really like it. The long and scene stealing ""Scenes From An Italian Restaraunt"" and the cool title track make it more than just pop music, there's elements of grandeur here but not over the top. Plus it has hit after hit - ""Only The Good Die Young"", ""Movin' Out"", ""She's Always A Woman"" and ""Just The Way You Are"" and most importantly, my pal Amy idolizes Billy and since I idolize my petite pal with large bosoms, I too love Billy Joel."
5,Quintessential Billy Joel,"When I listen to this CD, it's difficult for me to remember that I'm just listening to ""just another one of Billy Joel's CDs,"" because this one is LOADED with awesome material -- many of the songs from this album made it to the Top 40s, and for good reason.Whether you're a fan of Billy's more mellow pieces (""Just the Way You Are""), his more in-your-face songs (""Pressure,"" ""Moving Out"") or his fun numbers (""Only the Good Die Young""), ""The Stranger"" won't disappoint. And who could resist the combination of all three characteristics, ""Scenes from an Italian Restaurant""? It's all on this album, and this new CD, complete with remastered tracks and Windows/Mac-friendly video footage, delivers."
5,"Big Hits, Big CD","Extravigant songs on this CD, with many of his greatest hits on them. I would recomend this album over any other Billy Joel's albums. This is a great value and a great present to almost anyone. I have had the album for 8 months now listening to it on the way back from work everyday to sooth me. I give it 5 Stars!"
1,A Disgrace,"I bought this album thinking that it was a Billy Idol album, but this sounds nothing like Billy Idol! This garbage sounds awful! That idiot on the album cover should put that mask on in order to hide his massive shame over the pile of crap that this album REALLY is!"
3,A couple of jewels,"""She's always a woman"" and ""Just the way you are"" are major works surrounded by standard products."
2,Sounds decent but there are a few flaws,"This album sounds great for the most part, but there are a few things that pissed me off. First, it says that it includes a free digital download and even has a card inside the sleeve. In the fine print, though: Offer Valid Until July 8, 2009. Second, the vinyl was cut pretty badly. Most of the edges are cut to a point, but there's about a 3-inch section of the outer circumference that doesn't wither down like the rest (instead it's like many other 180g vinyls, with the wide edge). Lastly, the first half of the B side cracked quite a bit in the right channel. It wasn't audible during loud portions of the songs, but through most of Vienna it was loud enough to be annoying."
4,Jesse!,"Jesse, and I can't help but love him, pretty much sums up the ""essence"" of the Kingdom of God in this book, and that is that God is a good, not bad, god. God is a god who love, not hate, us. God is a god who heals us, not make us sick."
1,A Fantasy,"This book is just a book by a nut-case christian thinking that ""god"" is going to undo natural law just to justify a belief system that is stupid and primitive."
1,Zire Replacement Battery,Be careful to ascertain whether or not the battery will need to be taken to a technician as it does not always plug in but may need to be soldered (sp). That was in my case. The directions were also vague.
1,Didn't work for me.,"This battery didn't work as a replacement for my Zire 31. It was too big to fit in the space and when I soldered it, it didn't fix the problems I had. May have been something else, but the size issue would have been annoying if it had worked."
4,Excellent Scary Flicks,"Both are decent movies that have some frightening moments. I do not remember seeing them until recently, and really enjoyed them. I recommend them highly to anyone who enjoys this type of movie. Enjoy!"
5,Yummy,"Really yummy. I use it on taquitos. For those who don't like it hot, just use a little. I load it on like frosting."
5,Even works for water signs,"Being a Libran meant I had an uphill task, but Jeannie Innis' fabulous guide had helped me shed several pounds. Its astrological tips help you attain that perfect figure, and - more crucially - keep it. I'll have to be on my mettle though as the new moon in Capricorn looks like throwing a pretty big cheeseburger my way next week. A first rate guide."
5,An old- time favorite,"This was a childhood favorite of mine which I frequently read in the Library of the Troy Jewish Community Center 87 First Street.I can remember sitting there and reading about such questionable greats as Harry Danning, Sid Gordon and Moe Berg. Of course there were undoubted greats like Hank Greenberg and Sid Luckman. And there was in boxing too Barney Ross and Benny Leonard.Perhaps there are more up- to- date books about Jews in sports but I doubt there are any which tell a story as well, and give the young person such a warm feeling about the Jewish contribution to what seemed at that time of life, the most important form of human activity."
3,A book for young jews,"THIS IS GREAT JEWS IN SPORTS BY ROBERT SLATER, WITH INTRODUCTION BY RED AUERBACK. 2ND EDITION, PRINTED 1992. THIS IS A VERY LARGE HARDBACK WITH ELABORATE, ALTHLETE-FILLED INFORMATION. THERE ARE JEWS IN HERE WHO ARE SUPERSTARS SUCH AS SANDY KOUFAX, NAT HOLMAN, AL DAVIS, AND LOADS OF OTHERS WITH LIVELY WORD AND PICTURE PORTRAITS OF THEM, USUALLY 2-3 PAGES EACH. WHO FOUNDED THE NBA? WHO STARTED THE RING MANGAZINE? WHO WAS THE FIRST JEWISH BULLFIGHTER? WHO WAS THE GREATEST TABLE TENNIS PLAYER EVER? THERE ARE SURPRISES ON EVERY SINGLE PAGE, INCLUDING AN ALL-AMERICAN PLAYER WHO WENT ON TO THE PITTSBURGH STEELERS WHERE HE WAS CALLED ""THE RABBI."" THERE ARE 326 PAGES IN HERE AND AN INDEX AND THIS IS A BOOK THAT WILL ENTERTAIN YOU FOR HOURS AND ABSOLUTELY INFORM YOU! I THINK EVERY JEWISH HOME WITH A YOUNG PERSON NEEDS THIS BOOK. IT'S SO INSPIRING. STORIES IN HERE MAKE YOU JUST CLOSE IT AND SHAKE YOUR HEAD"
4,Beautiful Voice,She is awesome and pretty! and has a beautiful voice. the songs all kinda do sound the same but they're good. i want this cd for christmas!
3,Joy Enriquez > Not So Joyful,"i recently picked up this release because i liked 'what do you want', but the album does not stand out at all. it is a typical album of the nineties. darkchild's music is becoming really monotonous. the song 'shake up the party' sounds like a jennifer lopez song and all the other songs sound just as familiar. yes joy has a wonderful voice but her music does not have any impact whatsoever."
1,Every song sounds the same,"Every single fast song on this cd sounds the same. The only thing that changes is the lyrics, the beat stays the same. Joy dosn't realy mix it up at all. Her slow songs are not all that great either. Joy just dosn't have the strong voice to carry slow songs. I think she should have stuck to back ground singer for people like Mariah and Whitney."
4,No box - bulk splenda,"Thought I was receiving a boxed case of splenda packets. Instead I received a plastic bag of the 1000 packets. I guess if I was running a deli or restaurant wouldn't care. Item is bulk splenda & not boxed case that you would find at Costco or BJ's.But, has worked out just not what I was expecting."
3,Good Item But Costs TOO MUCH!,"Sure, Splenda is a good sweetener and I have bought it here in this quantity in the past, but it costs TOO MUCH here, and I especially feel this way when I went right now and found it at the samsclub website for half as much. Now of course, samsclub sucks because they won't ship it, but we have to pay shipping here too, so why can't the price be half as much also, or at least comparable to that? I would even be willing to buy the generic version of Splenda, (sucralose + maltodextrin + dextrose) ""Altern"", but that isn't offered here either, but if it is in the future, IT SHOULD ALSO BE AT LEAST HALF THE PRICE, or more realistically, 1/4th just like it is in real life. Anyway, I am sorry, I just wanted to gripe a little. Sweetener should not be only for rich people. If they were to charge that much for sugar (which it is, look it up on Wikipedia), I'm sure lots of other people would have a heart attack also (not just me). :P 6/10"
1,Vile putrid slime!,How could you people like this crap?! The more I use it the more I hate it. My family tells me it tastes just like sugar. I'm not sure that they ever actually had sugar! I'm stuck with using this in my coffee until I get my favorite sweetener called Ideal in the mail. I may run out and buy sugar as a back up until i get my sweetener. The tast of this is vile. the after taste is horrid. I might as well be putting fermented bile in my coffee! bleh!!!!!
4,As advertized,The product is fine. Whoever decided that a random number of words were necessary before a comment could be submitted......is not a people person. The first four words of my comments were all I really wanted to say!
4,Good value,The price for Splenda has been going up and this was the best deal I could find at the time. I looked again now and I am finding better deals but it might change again. All in all if you like this product look around the site and find the best price. If you haven't used this product before I would find a smaller quantity to try first.
2,I Agree,"Buying a video without knowing what episodes are on it is very risky, like a roll of the dice."
1,Don't be fooled!,"Ok, I am one of the biggest fans of the Andy Griffith show. And I'm even more of a fan of Don Knotts. BUT, this DVD is worthless for one reason - its video quality is worse than broadcast television (I'm not kidding). I bought this at a local store that won't take returns on opened DVD's, so I lost out. What a waste of money. Don't buy it!If you want a great Don Knotts movie on DVD, buy ""The Shakiest Gun in the West"". Its absolutely perfect in every way! (as far as Don Knotts movies go)"
4,Andy Griffith SHow - 16 Episodes,"Most reviews listed are absolutely wrong and must be referring to some other release. The all-important theme song is there for all 16 episodes and while the video quality is not as good as the TV LAND reruns - it is 16 COMPLETE episodes for $$$! The video quality is ""fair"" - still great to have for the money AND original music."
2,unknown titles,It is hard to purchase something without knowing what episodes are on the tape. It would be nice to see a detailed list of the shows.
1,Patience is rewarded,"Finally, after years of clamoring for Paramount to release (what I and countless others consider the finest television series of all time), Seasons one and two are available AND season three is scheduled for release in August.For years all we had were the public domain episodes from seson three but greatfully our wait is nearly over.All of the various ""collections"" have served their purpose and I remain grateful for the gap that they filled, but within a matter of months we should have all eight seasons available. Therefore, if possible, now is the time to be patient for just a little longer with the knowledge that all is going to work out and with a little proding Paramount may consider speeding the release of seasons four through eight.I would not recommend purchasing any TAGS ""collections"" at this time"
3,not that bad,"This DVD isn't that bad, but not exactly perfect. The video quality would get 8/10 and the sound quality 7/10. The audio would often go up and down several times. The video is almost what you get watching cable TV. The theme on this is the original except for 2 of the episodes on the last disk.- HelpfulReviews.com"
4,16 Wonderful Episodes of Andy Griffith,"These 16 uncut episodes [with orginal theme music] are excellent. The picture quality is very good. The Loaded Goat,rarely seen on tv, is worth the price of the dvd. This is a mustfor fans of the show.Hats off to Brentwood Home Video fo thisgreat release."
1,Poor Quality - 5 minutes missing from one of the episodes!,"I bought this DVD expecting to see some of my favorite episodes, and yes some of the episodes are uncut. But overall the picture quality is terrible, additionally one of my favorite episodes (the one with the English Butler) is missing 5 critical minutes of he episode where the butler talks about how he likes staying with Andy and Opie, but overhears Andy and Barney talking on the porch that night. The scene obviously is missing when the butler just disappears right in the middle of the episode.Watch TV land instead, and you'll get a better quality result."
3,Disapointing...,"The Andy Griffith Show is one of my favorite television shows... This DVD is not one of my favorites!! I bought it at Ross (heh...), I was excited and when I got home to watch it was terrible!! Yes, the shows are uncut, and the original air length, but the picture quality would porably sicken you!!If you want to see uncut episodes, you might want to buy this DVD, but if you want good quality, might as wee watch TVLand, or... find a different DVD>"
4,Brentwood has the best DVD release of these episodes!,"I saw that some of the reviews listed for the Brentwood Home Video release of these episodes on DVD are incorrect. This review is specifically for the 16 episode, 2 disc set made by Brentwood Home Video:Sound and picture quality on these discs is very good. There are no major scratches on the film prints as seen on some other DVDs. Every episode is complete and uncut. The original theme music is used on every show and there are no company logos embedded on the image to distract you as on other discs. Basically, you get all 16 public domain episodes, uncut, with decent picture and sound quality in one 2-disc set. They are simply the best DVDs of these episodes currently available..."
1,The Andy Griffith Show - 5 pack,"This is the lamest video product i have ever seen. First of all, there are only two episodes per disc for a total of about 50 minutes of video. DVD's can hold AT LEAST five episodes per disc : what a tremendous waste of space and packaging ! Next, the wonderful @ familiar theme song has been REPLACED (if you can believe that! ) by new elevator-type music. Man, what genius thought that one up ? Third, the video images are horrible and look worse than rabbit-ear antenna reception in a thunder storm. Finally, the ""special features"" are so pathetic that i honestly think that fifth graders could do a better job. I love the old andy griffith shows too much to remain silent about this incredibly bad product. Consider yourself warned and ""nip this one in the bud."" Nip it, nip it, nip it !"
1,Wait...DO NOT buy this DVD,"Dismal picture quality (it looks like it was literally recorded off the air by somebody using a consumer DVD recorder). WAIT until somebody decides to release quality sets. I am sure the original masters exist; they are valuable enough that at some point the whole series will be released. MONEY and greed talk. In the meantime, just tape or DVD record your OWN episodes off TV for free...you'll get better quality."
3,The music is not the original Andy Griffith song???,I love Andy Griffith but was very disapointed that they did not play the original Andy Griffith song before the episode began. Otherwise it was fine.
3,Too Bad about the sound,"The picture quality is good, the audio has a hiss in it. If the sound was better I recommend the set. At this price it is not a bad deal if you can take to listen to the hiss."
1,Terrible,"The themesong has been removed and the copy looks like it was shot from a video camera off TAGS playing on a tv set.I figure the person that gave a five star rating was the owner of Madacy. Amazon really should not let the DVD distributors/owners rate their own products. This is the first and last Madacy product I will ever purchase. I'm really surprised to find big retailers carrying this [product]!Luckily I found the set in a junk bin for [money].I thought about giving the set to someone for Christmas, but it is so bad I would be embarresed to give it as a present. I guess I'll just donate it to charity and write the loss off on my taxes."
1,Do not waste time or money,"Do not waste your time or money on this or other ""BEST OF..."" sets. The seasons are coming out through Paramount (season one and two already and season three August 16). These episodes have been in ""public domain"" and therefore available for years and now, in just over a month all of the first 94 episodes will be out there. Also season two had the original sponser spots which I thought were fun as well."
4,The Best Of The Bunch...,"This is definitely better than the other sets out there-the theme music is original on all but two of the episodes, and source material is clean. Interestingly, all these episodes are from the 1962-63 season, and they comprise the entire latter part of that season-every episode from 1/21/63 to 5/6/63! The only complaint that I could make is that it would have been easy to place the episodes in chronological order. But all the PD material available is here to enjoy."
4,The best Andy Griffith DVD available!,"Finally some of The Andy Griffith Show episodes have been released on DVD. Sure, these are six of the sixteen episodes that have been in the public domain and available from other companies for years, but the quality of these are the best you're gonna get! And these are the full, uncut versions unlike ones from another company that had released three episodes on DVD. I praise LaserLight for doing what they can to bring classic TV to DVD. A great gift for an Andy fan with a new DVD player. I also suggest LaserLight's DVDs of The Lucy Show and a Christmas Marathon disc which includes episodes of The Beverly Hillbillies, Ozzie and Harriet, and The Jack Benny Show."
1,"TAGS watchers, do not waste your money!","This series of 5 CDs contains only 2 episodes per CD. The video quality is very, very poor and ""The Fishin' Hole"" theme song has been removed. If Andy Taylor knew about the poor quality of these CDs, Barney definitely would ""be allowed to arrest somebody!"". If it were my company (Amazon.com), I would warn the prospective buyer of this CD set. If you are a devoted TAGS rerun watcher, I can safely rest assured that you will be disappointed and irritated with these CDs. Madacy is the name on these CDs."
1,I feel cheated,"Not what I had hoped for. The opening theme is missing, The transfer to DVD is poor and there are only 10 episodes on 5 discs...2 per disc! I would not but this if I knew then what I know now...This is in spite of the fact that I now live and work in France and felt like I really needed a Mayberry fix to get me in touch with my roots....Avoid."
3,The Episodes Featured,"This DVD set contains the episodes found on previous releases by Medacy and Sterling: ""Rafe Hollister Sings,"" ""Class Reunion,"" ""The Big House,"" ""A Wife for Andy,"" ""Mountain Wedding,"" ""Opie and the Spoiled Kid,"" ""Andy Discovers America,"" ""Aunt Bea's Medicine Man,"" ""The Darlings Are Coming,"" ""The Great Filling Station Robbery,"" ""The Loaded Goat,"" ""High Noon in Mayberry,"" ""Barney's First Car,"" ""Andy's English Valet,"" ""Dogs, Dogs, Dogs,"" and ""The Rival."" Fans will recognize ""The Loaded Goat"" and ""Barney's First Car"" as some of the finest episodes in the series.You'll receive two double-sided DVDs in this set.Let's hope someone comes up with a definitive, restored edition of this fine program."
2,Not what you would expect,"This collection does contain the Andy Griffith episodes it states, however the consumer is short changed in several ways. First, the official (whistling)opening music is omitted for whatever reason. Second, the quality of episodes is suspect. Third, considering what they are charging for this set, one would expect more episodes. I highly recommend not buying this item. I would wait until other Andy Griffith DVD's are released containing the same episodes. As a matter of fact there are several episodes in this set that are on other Andy DVD's."
1,Love Andy Griffith...But,"I love the Andy Griffith Show, but this DVD was a big dissappointment. ""Best of"" not even close, contains only 3 (mediocre) episodes. And doesn't even include the original theme or credit music. ""Classic Favorites"" is much better, 6 episodes."
1,Very Disappointed,"No theme music. ""Best of"" is a joke. Only 3 episodes. Would have been much better to watch the reruns on TV. Not at all collector quality."
3,Andy Griffith,"I brought a selection of Andy Griffith movies and I was very disappointed. Out of the 4 dvds,that I purchased there were 3-all of the same episodes."
2,TAGS collection review,"I was about to buy this DVD on Saturday, but I decided I would wait til' the price goes down or wait until the first season comes out. I also saw what company these DVD'S were from (Madacy Entertainment) so I said ""forget it""!"
1,Don't buy this Collection!,"This collection does not contain the original music, and the quality is horrible. The real collections are starting to be distributed by Paramount Home Video, thanks to pressure from fans and the success of the Dick Van Dyke show collections."
2,Too big and manly for my taste.,"I just received this watch today and I will be returning it. I found it too be too big for my wrist and a bit too manly looking. I've been trying to find a women's digital watch with an all stainless steel band and this fit the bill feature-wise but just wasn't feminine enough and is too big for my petite wrist.As an alternative, I also ordered the Baby-G Ladies Watch Baby-G G-ms MSG-300D-4BDR-6 and will be keeping it. It's a bit smaller, fitting my wrist much better, and has a more feminine look. I would recommend checking it out instead of this one if you have a small wrist (mine is 5-1/2"") and you don't want to look like you're wearing a man's watch."
4,Great watch,"This watch is exactly as described. It is easy to use, and is not as heavy as you would think. It is pretty large for a woman's watch - If you are really thin, it will probably look like you are wearing a man's watch. The watch has a metal bracelet and metal around the face, but the silver colored plastic case is obviously plastic - you can tell that it is not all metal. Over all, I would definitely buy this watch again."
1,MANLY!!,I bought this watch for my mom who loves digital watches and when I got it in the mail I was extremely disappointed. Looks like a mans watch. Very large.
2,Much less than perfect,"First of all, I'm male. The classic problem for men's digital watches featuring all that stuff is the enourmus size, and the designs, almost always overelaborate. And the plastic strap, not durable.This watch has meant for women, but its size is perfect for a man. In fact, it's too big for a lady. For me, it is gorgeus, easy to use, easy to see the time.Everything perfect? I'm sorry it's not: the alarm sound... why so quiet? And the light, I'm sorry its white. The date is not visible enough, but everything else it's fine and pretty. The strap is very good quality and beauty too. So... almost perfect!Two years later: Suddenly, the plastic zone around the crown began to loose the paint. It looks awful, so... goodby watch."
3,Expensive but Few Alternatives,"Little did I realize how much a Hamilton Beach humidifier would cost me more in consumables than the actual unit itself. I have three in the house, since I have forced air heat and live in a four-season region, and needed to humidify the sleeping rooms. Amazingly, the filters are hard to find, and even crazier to price reasonably. Not too many alternatives, and now I'm leery of buying replacement humidifiers on the chance that I'll end up in the same boat again with the newer model."
3,stitch movie poster,Arrived bent and beat up I am very upset with the company that sold it. They will not even reply to my emails.
4,Three Nuts in Search of a Bolt,"The previous writer is in error. ""Three Nuts in Search of a Bolt"" is definitely the Mamie VanDoren movie. He has this movie confused with ""Promises! Promises!"" which starred Jayne Mansfield and Tommy Noonan. The confusion probably arose because both films had Playboy spreads, and both co-starred Tommy Noonan.""Three Nuts"" is a funny film and for the writer to give it one star just because he had to give it something does a disservice to the movie and Amazon customers."
5,If you have been dumped...this is your album,"Joe does a great job with this album and the one song that tells the truth about life is so true in the lyrics of ""Take your Love and....."
5,Comedy album of the year!!!,Joe Pesci revisites his role as Vincent LaGuardia Gambini of My Cousin Vinny Fame.He is excellent as he spoofs numerous genres of music. The title track (Yo Cousin Vinny)will become a cult hit.Other songs poke fun at wiseguys and stereotypical mob themes.Pesci's funnies performance since My Cousin Vinny.The best comedy album since the Jerky Boys.
5,"""Take Your Love"" IS the Best","I heard this song played on the Don and Mike radio show and it is heeeeelarious! Man, the $13 price tag is worth it just for this song. I know I'll be listening to the song for days and I know my friends will enjoy it. Good stuff from Pesci!"
3,"3 hillarious songs, the rest, blah","i LOVE Joe Pesci: He is HILLARIOUS in every movie I see with him in it, from Home Alone to My Cousin Vinny. I saw an ad for this cd in a Columbia House magazine, and I decided to check it out. I was dissapointed. ""Yo Cousin Vinny"", ""Take Your Love & Shove It"", and ""Wise Guy"" are hillarious, but the rest is just, not that funny. Knowing the hillarious man Pesci is, I know he could have done much better than this. Don't buy this: just download the 3 songs I mentioned, and if you want good comedy music, check out Jack Black's band Tenacious D.Come on Pesci, I know how funny you can be, you can do better than this!"
2,"barely funny, definitely crude","This album has a few funny moments buried in a pile of garbage. Save your money for the ""My Cousin Vinny"" rentals and you will be a lot happier. At least with the movie you get to see an Oscar winning supporting performance by Marisa Tomei (who isn't too hard on the eyes, either)."
3,Little Joe sure can sing!,"This is actually Joe Pesci's second album. His hard to findfirst albumcame out in 1968 and consisted mostly of covers of Beatles and Bee Gees songs (I actually have a copy of it). Thirty years later, he released this second album. It is ostensibly performed as the character he played inMy Cousin Vinny, but some of the songs don't seem to be performed by Vinny. For example, in the song ""Wise Guy"", he refers to himself as ""Pesci"". Anyway, most of the songs here are played for laughs, but some of them are done more or less seriously. The songs that are played for laughs are fairly amusing, although most of laughs come from hearing Joe sing vulgarities. As for the serious songs, they are fairly decent, but Joe is no Tony Bennett. But I will admit that this album is better than most albums recorded by actors."
1,Vincent Laguardia Gambini Sings Just for You,"A friend asked me to buy this CD for him online as a gift for his sister. I was very pleased that the CD arrived in much less time than projected. Since this was a gift, my friend wanted a new CD, and it was still in the shrinkwrap. That's the good news. Bad news is that that jewel case was broken and cracked. I wrote to the seller, and received no reply, however, 2 days later, an empty jewel case arrived in the mail. It was scratched and dirty with adhesive still on it from whatever was in it before. By this time it was too late to order a new CD. Seller should have replaced it with a new CD, which is what I purchased--or at the very least, should have responded to say that he didn't have another.Was not at all happy with this transaction...First time I was dissatisfied with Amazon, and I won't deal with private sellers any more."
3,Prelude to Potential,"I read this after reading The Book Thief, and even though the author's writing style annoyed me at first, there's is something organic about it. Honest. This book reminded me of my family, my brothers, and sibling rivalry."
5,Poetic and adorable peek into the adolescence of an artist,"Please don't ever judge this book by its cover. Based on the title and image, I was expecting a shallow hormone-fest for teen boys, but it's a beautifully written story of an artist discovering his craft and finding his sense of worth because of it. I freaking love this book. Zusak balances humor and poetry like nothing I've ever seen. It's awesome, but completely unpretentious. He also handles sibling relationships in a touching and realistic way.I read this book like once a month. It's that good."
4,Another great read by Zusak!,"I discovered Zusak with ""Book Thief."" I then read ""I Am Messenger"" and finally got my hands on this book in the library. Initially when I started reading it, I thought this was going to be too simple of a story for me to enjoy. Wow, was I wrong!! Cameron Wolf really grew on me, as well as his relationships with everyone else, especially Ruben. I can see Zusak laying a common foundation in this book (as well as ""I Am Messenger"") to culminate in the telling of ""Book Thief."" Highly recommended!"
4,Getting The Girl: A Teen's Perspective,"Not Zusak's best work but still a great read for teens. The main character Cameron is a gentleman and half, not to mention somewhat of a hopeless romantic, a rare find in a teenage boy. You get a good glance into Cameron's mind through the journals he keeps along with his narrative in the story. I didn't LOVE this story but as I read I felt a certain kinship with Cameron as I understand about unrequited love and finding something good only to lose it. I wasn't too keen on Octavia mind you, but she did serve well as the one to give Cameron a much needed boost of confidence. Again, not the best from Zusak but still a superb read."
2,Another OK prep book,"I bought this book by winter and read it on the plane in winter break. Although the review was very short, it has 6 sample tests, which are very similar, but somehow easier than the AP exams. I suggest you should get the Cliff Notes is you have a lot of time. Otherwise, this book will be fine."
2,Pregnancy for Dummies,"I am appalled that any book on pregnancy would tout the ""convenience"" of having your labor induced. The idea that working parents with busy schedules can just go in and ""have"" their baby at any time is not only unnatural but so unfair to the safety of the newborn. If you are too busy to work your labor into your schedule, then I think you should rethink whether you want to raise a child."
1,This is the worse Dummies book I have read (and I have a lot of them).,"There was nothing about midwifes, home births, doing it green, advice on how to give birth naturally. It is a very ordinary pregnancy guide, nothing special. A big disappointment as I love the dummies series. On top of that I didn't like the way it was organized. I would have preferred it to list the pregnancy symptoms/development month by month."
5,great book to have.,"My wife and I found this to be our favorite book when we were having are too little girls. So when a coworkers wife was expecting, I ordered this book for them."
2,I'm not that dumb.,"It may be titled ""Pregnancy for Dummies"", but even though I've never been pregnant before... it turns out I'm not THIS dumb. Unless you've been completely under a rock your whole life, you already know more than this book can teach you. Skip it and buy something else."
4,The author is my doctor,"I'm lucky enough to have Dr. Stone assist me with my twin pregnancy, the book is great for those who can't actually see her. She doesn't take the fearful, doom-and-gloom approach (my gripe with other pregancy books), but has excellent information on how to have a baby safely."
2,Less than Satisfactory,"I love this series of books - but didn't love this one. Some really important issues - like dealing with illness while pregnant - were dealt with in a very superficial way. I am pregnant for the first time, and I have a ton of really specific questions. This book does not go very far in answering those questions. For a first-time mom, I would suggest ""What to Expect When You Are Expecting,"" instead. This book simply does not provide enough detailed information to be truly helpful. It is more like an outline of everything you need to know; but you still end up seeking out other books to get more info, so save yourself the money and skip this one."
2,Do not buy if you are American,"I bought this book not realizing that it was the UK edition. So the book spends a bit of time going over UK health care, welfare and medical benefits of UK citizens. Since I am American none of this pertained to me. Also some of the vernacular is different, understandable but different (mum = mom, labor = Labour). Some words were confusing if you didn't spend a minute to look them up such as Paracetamol (thats actually tylenol). Also things such as the food guide pyramid are different because each country has its own pyramid. If you are not from the UK, keep looking until you find the US version. THe technical baby stuff is the same, but much of the other stuff is much different. You will be much happier if you get the US version. If you are from the UK - You will love it"
2,not worth buying if you want to know all your birth options,"Since I am a nurse and doula amongst other titles, I figured I would see what this book is all about and I must say that I was very disappointed in it, including the tv program that was based on this book. This book reminded me of going to a hospital-based childbirth education class, where it only gives you one side of birth- the medicalinized way or no way at all, with intervention after intervention. It did not describe at all any of the pain management techniques other than medications, nor did it describe or mention homebirth or birth center options, or even doula support. If you want to know all the current info out there, this book is definately not the one to get."
2,the really mean pregnancy for DUMMIES.,"Honestly, this book is written for a third grader. One of the first things it talks about is how pregnancy is broken up into ""trimesters"" REALLY?wow. If you know NOTHING about birth/pregnancy then maybe you would benefit from this book. However I found it really unhelpful and I quit reading after a few chapters...."
1,Don't Bother,"A truly ""dumb"" book - there are several other pregnancy guides that are much more useful (and still easy to navigate)."
5,Highly recommended,"I purchased or was given three pregnancy books and this was by far the best. The others were written by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (my husband is an OB/GYN) and What to Expect . . . I did not like the organization or content of What to Expect . . . and the ACOG book was a little skimpy on the practical questions I had. Pregnancy for Dummies was funny and answered all my questions with medically appropriate advice, according to my husband whose medical opinion I highly respect. It is light-hearted at times, which I liked a lot, but still provided serious and complete advice - not for those without a sense of humor though! All in all, a very good choice, especially for first time mothers."
5,Moisturising,Amazing oil.The smell is not ovehelming like other indian oils.It has no added fragrance.It keeps my hair soft shiny and moisturised.My hair is also strong and healthy and growing.I wish they sold it in a bigger bottle.
4,helped with hair falling,"I have been gradually losing hair in last 5 years. I wasn't using any hair oil or gel. One of my friends suggested that i should look into Bhringaraj Oil for hair falling and hair weakness. I have been using this product for almost a year now and notice stronger hair. This however doesn't do any miracle and grow new hair, but it does help with strengthening existing hair. One other thing i like about this oil is that it doesn't leave any bad smell."
4,Dry but works,"I did something kind of interesting with the oil - I added it to my shampoo so that every day I wash my hair, the oil smell isn't even something I worry about. It turned the shampoo a green tint but it works. One of the girls I work with just mentioned how long my hair is getting, and I've only bee using it for 3 weeks. It dried out my hair a little bit but just throwing conditioner over it worked perfectly and my hair is soft, strong and long. :) I like it."
2,Not impressed,"I don't like this oil at all. Not only is it greasy, but it smells mostly like sesame seed oil, which has me wondering if that's the main ingredient rather than the bhringaraj. I also don't notice any difference in my hair other than it smells like my hands after eating a greasy pizza."
1,Does it or Does it not greow hair.,"Based on the confused feed back it grows hair, but yet it does not, a real bizzarre review it sounds like someone is confused and has no problem confusing every one else. I have never tried this product but, based on the stupidity that this reviewer decided to give, I probably would not try it, then on the other hand if I was as coffused as this reviewer I might. Bottom line does it work or does it not work."
3,Useful thing but costs more than other similar ones,"Useful thing but costs more than other similar ones. It works fine, but I was expecting it to cost around ~$3 - $4."
3,OK for the money,"It is cheap, and it does what it is required to. Not super precise, not very convenient to use, but good as a quick solution."
4,"Works, very accurate, cheap. BUT...","The gauge is very accurate, almost as good as my ~$25 digital one.Very easy to use and to get a perfect seal without even trying, which is very hard with other brand products (like my ~$25 one).Too bad it contains lead. 1 star off it would have been perfect. =(Other than that, works very very good."
5,Joyous Christmas pop at its best!,"I heard this cd a year ago when it was first released by Donny's fan club. The man has voice that truly is unequaled and fits any type of song out there. From traditional renditions, to modernized re-workings, to brand new funked up regge christmas songs the cd is a treat and great addition to anyones collection. Donny is someone who needs to be realized for his wonderful gift...his voice, and his gifted writing abilites."
4,Nice Christmas Listening,The CD arrived in a timely manner and in perfect condition. Donny's voice is wonderful but the choices of songs we not as good as I had hoped they would be. I would say it is more of an easy listening type Christmas CD.
5,IT'S ONE OF THE BEST CHRISTMAS CD'S I HAVE HEARD.,"THE BEST SONG I LOVE ON THIS CD IS ""SOLDIER KING"". THE FIRST TIME I HEARD IT REMINDED ME OF WHY WE REALLY CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS. ""O HOLY NIGHT"" IS SO BEAUTIFUL. THE ARRANGEMENT ON THIS SONG IS OVERWHELMING. THE BEST PART OF THE SONG IS WHEN DONNY COMES IN AND SINGS {HE TAUGHT US TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER},I'VE NEVER HEARD IT ARRANGED LIKE THAT BEFORE. I REALLY LIKED HOW HE GOT HIS FAMILY TO SING PARTS ON ONE OF THE SONGS. I WAS ALSO FAVOURED BY ""BABY"" WITH DONNY SINGING ALL THE PARTS. ALL IN ALL THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST I HAVE HEARD!"
5,The True Meaning of Christmas Shines Brilliantly,"I've had this CD for over a year and last year I thought it was a good Christmas CD. This year when I truely listened to the words and I was touched to the heart. This CD truely tells the love and message of what Christmas is and it is without a doubt my favorite Christmas CD. As new Christmas favorites I love, Mary, Did You Know?, Come to the Manger, and Who Took the Merry Out of Christmas? To me these songs elegantly express what the feelings of Mary were as she gazed upon this newborn son of hers. Angels We Have Heard on High, Deck the Halls/Hark the Herald Angels Sing, and O Holy Night/Divine are superior in the presentation he has given. So many of the songs simply give me much to think about in the birth of Jesus Christ and he has done the most wonderful thing that any recording artist can hope to achieve, to cause the listener to listen with their heart each and everytime they listen with their ears open and not preoccupied."
5,A Classic that Enchants Everyone,"I thought I cared only for classical music until Mr. Osmond changed my mind. I have dozens of Christmas recordings, but this is now my favorite. Christmas at Home enchants everyone. The oldsters love its classic carols: musically rich, vocally superb and delivered by a man who knows what he's singing about. The kids also appreciate the reggae Deck the Halls/Hark the Herald Angels and the rock-tempo songs such as Who Took the Merry. A Soldier's King will remind fans of 1989 and Soldier of Love: it's the Little Drummer Boy as Vietnam vet. And my favorite 30 seconds is the snippet of God Rest ye Merry that revisits the concept of ""Osmond Family Singers."" The album closes with a Come to the Manger that sent me to the fine print to discover a senator's name. In short, buy Christmas at Home for yourself; get a few for gifts. This is classic stuff."
4,Beautiful Christmas Album,"Christmas is my favorite time of year. I have a large assortment of holiday music, but a handful of truly meaningful CD's. Donny has captured the heart of Christmas in this CD. He has brought alive why we celebrate. While the entire CD is quite good, Mary did you know is powerful. It'll touch you to the very core. A must CD."
5,Not Christmas without it,"This album has been a Christmas cornerstone for me since its release seven years ago. It is one of the most unique collections of Christmas songs I've ever heard, ranging from familiar classics like ""The Most Wonderful Time of the Year"" to relatively unknown but still amazing songs like ""After December Slips Away."" Included in the track list is a captivating Calypso version of ""Deck the Halls,"" and I don't think anyone has ever done ""Grown-Up Christmas List"" more justice than Donny. It's only the first week of November, but I've been blasting this CD in my car for the past few weeks since it arrived in the mail. Even though the snow hasn't started falling yet, hearing these fantastic songs again puts the smell and feel of the Christmas season in the air."
2,Cannot download CD,The holiday music is very enjoyable but I purchased this CD to download to my IPOD and it will not download to iTunes and you cannot burn a CD from it.
2,disappointed,"i purchased this CD b/c of the positive reviews on this website, but am quite disappointed. 2 reasons specifically: first, i was surprised that osmond's voice isn't very good - i was expecting more. and second (and this may not be an issue for many people) the sound was too pop and didn't feel Christmasy. i prefer a more classic sound for Christmas like natile cole's the magic of Christmas or amy grant's home for Christmas. those both have a contempory, yet classic sound."
5,Simply The Best!!!,"I purchased this CD because I am a Donny fan. To my surprise, my husband loves this CD as well. I has to purchase him his own so that he would leave mine alone. When Donny sings, you can tell that he feels the words that he is singing. This is a very moving CD. This is the one that you will play every year....it is a classic!"
4,a must have,"This is a must have in your christmas collection, some great tradionals and wonderful new renditions. Truly brings out the real meaning of christmas...JESUS. Must hear ""After December Slips Away""!!!"
5,One of the most intense voices I've ever heard,Marla Glen possesses one of the most intense voices I've ever heard. She is a true artist devoted to her music and delivering a message in a most powerful and deeply felt manner.She is probably one of the most popular soul artists in Europe and given the fact that she is an American national living in Paris makes it hard to believe that she is not more well known in her own home country.This was her debut album and it hit Europe like a lightning bolt.I can only strongly recommend her work to anyone. Listen to her and you'll understand.
4,Little guy who slashed Sauron and became a Gollum.....,"Isildur was the son of Elendil. I have bought the papa,and now the son! And if you have a Sauron figure and perhaps the Elves like gil-galad you will have a epic battle on your hands. Isildur is a important figure for he defeats Sauron by cutting off his One Ring of Power and thus destroys him....(A lot of you might know this.....) But did you know Isildur gets drowned in the river because he failed to throw the Ring into the fiery mountain. Elrond I bet was not too sad for the yougun prince. Poor guy. He saved the Tree of Numenor before the island was destroyed and brought it to Gondor. So he was really a good man and small like Aragorn but he turned out like Gollum. So buy this cool figure and have fun. Maybe you can take him for a swim in the bathtub and recreate that scene where he loses the ring in the river and the orcs stick him with arrows. Just don't let him go down the drain........."
2,"Not the best, but not that bad","Of course, every CD I own of Billy's has something good about it, and I love every one, but I'm sorry to say that this is my least favorite. It has a lot of great songs, but the recordings seem rather tired. Miami 2017 is too slow, Angry Young Man is also, and James is a sleeper.However, All You Wanna Do Is Dance is a fun song, I do like this version of Say Goodbye to Hollywood, and New York State of Mind is very relaxing.If you like a lot of the songs on this album (Miami 2017, Say Goodbye to Hollywood, Summer Highland Falls), and if you have not already done so, I'd strongly reccomend ""Songs in the Attic"". Many of the songs on this album are on that one, and the live versions have something that the album versions do not. If you're just starting out with your BJ collection, I'd put this album aside for later."
5,"Classic Joel, before the pop star emerged","This is classic Billy Joel material on a self produced album. Great stories, good mix of tempos.If you need to listen to early Billy Joel, you cannot go wrong here."
4,"If you like the songs, you need to get ""Songs In The Attic""","All I can say is that these songs are great, but the live versions of ""Miami 2017, Say Goodbye To Hollywood, Summer Highland Falls, and I've Loved These Days"" are MUCH better. Producer Phil Ramone said it best that these songs really do sound better live. For true Billy fans though, this is a good album to have for comparison, so you can enjoy the original studio recordings as well. Besides, this cd (like the rest of the Billy Joel collection) is 24-bit remastered and inexpensive!"
1,At the Core of a singer-songwriter,"This album finds Billy Joel at the dawn of the superstardom to come. There are a number of songs that could very well have been hits had this album been released after he had been internationally established with The Stranger and 42nd St. Notably - Miami 2017, Summer Highland Falls, and New York State of Mind are album-cut classics and are as good as anything he had written before or since. For those fans who were introduced to Billy Joel through Just The Way You Are, and the rest of The Stranger album, Turnstiles is well worth the purchase to discover a prior album of equal weight and substance."
3,Disappointed State Of Mind,"A marred remix of ""New York State Of Mind"" had me promptly remove my headphones in disgust and search for my vinyl and first generation cd release of my favourite of all Billy Joel titles. Sometimes, less is more, especially regarding a saxaphone that once hinted at the subways musicians who showcase their talents in exchance for a coin (or token) of appreciation. The remixed version irritated me with a sax overriding the complete composition. (Will someone please give this guy $5 to quit playing!!!) Also a slightly altered clarinet throughout ""I've Loved These Days"" torments a highlight of this classic. Billy, did K-Tel put you up to this? The highlight, a crystaline remaster of ""Summer Highland Falls"". Personally, I'll keep my originals (worthy of 5 stars) & pawn the remaster."
4,Timing Is Everything,"Largely ignored when it came out, this is far superior than, for example, Glass Houses. The fact that Joel has continued to play most of these songs in his live shows, including, of course, the timeless ""New York State Of Mind"" shows the respect Joel himself has for these songs. Joel has often said he wishes he could re-record these songs to get closer to the sound he was searching for, but to paraphrase Joel himself, I like these songs ""Just The Way (They) Are."""
4,Great all-purpose glass,"Although I have Riedel Cab and Pinot glasses, they must be washed by hand so I usually use them only for great wine or for guests. The gourmet glass fits easily in the diishwasher, stores easily in any cupboard and delivers good taste, especially for whites, in a convenient manner. As an ""everyday"" glass, it has no peer."
4,great for whites and dishwashers,"this is the second time I've ordered these glasses, replacing some that broke from daily usage. their short stems are ideal for dishwashers. the small bowl however makes them less than ideal for hearty reds. best for white wines. for reds, go with Riedel's stemless tumbler style wine glasses. the lack of a stem is not ideal, but you'll appreciate how they fit in the dishwasher."
1,"glass from France, not crystal from Austria","Riedel's water glass and gourmet glass are both made in France of glass (not crystal). The stem's too short for wine in my opinion, but you could always use them for water. The water glasses are more suitable, though, as they have a wider mouth."
5,Super stuff!,"I've read this magazine for years and have found it so useful for my information resource guide. It has the latest information on drugs and therapies, and the food section is incredible. From Fast and easy recipes of your favorite foods to nutrient information guides that covers so many areas of diabetic living. Diabetes Self-Management magazine is worth the money!"
5,must read,"I have several books on diabetes. This magazine, I believe, is a must read for those afflicted. It has great articles and hopefully will keep me updated on new discoveries and treatments."
4,Nostalgia on the cheap,"Do you still have your old Atari tucked away for those rainy days? Do you enjoy good old-fashioned low budget graphics? Are you more then happy with a character who's just a cursor-a sword that's just an arrow-and dragons that look like ducks? If so Adventure is every bit as fun as you remember, or as much fun as all your other old Atari games. Yes it's utterly pathetic when compared with every other modern video game on the market, but for pure nostalgia it can't be beat. Grand Theft Auto 4 may be mind-blowing, but it can't make you feel like you're ten years old again. Although if it does you should probably get some sort of help for that."
4,So far so good!,While it has seen limited use so far it has met my expectations.Attaching the wheels was straight forward and not a problem.The only reason for the 4 out of 5 stars is that one of the swivel casters doesn't quite swivel as freely as it should but I don't think it will hinder the overall performance.The folding handle seems a little shaky but I will wait until I've used the cart a few times with a heavy load before I judge that.So far I am very happy with it and would recommend it to anyone looking for a heavy duty hand truck that folds for compact storage at a reasonable price.
2,I received My Package Broken and the Item scratched Up.,I received my product is somewhat of a mess. I haven't written or said anything. I was dissappointed.
3,Nice Design. Keyhole-type Mounting,"I like these shelves because of their design -- they have ""built-in"" bookends. They are made of some sort of a composite material, and are available in a number of ""finishes"" or unfinished, so they be painted after delivery.The shelves mount via typical key-hole slots. The keyhole slots are not reinforced. The shelves come with screws only, but not with any types of anchors etc. Take appropriate precautions and mount with safety in mind, especially if you are putting these up on dry-wall and are unsure about the location of wall studs. Consider additional bracing, especially if heavy books will be placed on them, to ensure they don't go ""flying""."
3,badly trained gaurd dogs,"I properly trained gaurd dog would not attack someone who is being submissive. I do understand the suit maybe why the dog attacked. However I know properly trained gaurd dog dose not contuinally attack in such manner. But it was clear at bsinging hy way dogs were jumping all over the place they were poorly trained. They were trained just to attack and the is not a gaurd dog. A good guard dog,alerts handler 1st and will only chase on comand etc."
5,A Tour of the Knowledge,"I found my copy of this gem in a thrift store book section and purchased it for an entire fifty-cents. So far this book has proven to be a intellectual powerhouse and it never disappoints. Articles have been hand picked by the Britannica editors from the best of the encyclopedias' authors over the years. Toward the back there are abbreviated treatises on various topics from some well knowns. Einstein on Relativity, Whitehead on Mathematics, and T.E. Lawrence on Guerrilla Warfare to name but a few. If you're a generalist and/or a fan of the encyclopedic style you need this book."
3,Phar-Lap,It was ok. I really wasn't looking for the poster buy for the movie. I read the description wrong. It was my mistake.
5,These are my fave Books :-),"I love these books. I have all the set of six books and Keep reading them over an over, They are wonderful.they where given to me about 12 years ago. highly reccomendthem for people who like unicorns, warriors or fantasy book like I do :)enjoy :-)"
5,Such a great book!!,"I was on vacation with my parents and came across the first in the series. I loved it so much, they had the whole set special ordered for me. I still read them over and over again to this day, and to see the condition of the books lets you know that! I was hoping that I could get my hands on some newer copies to have around, and you can be sure I'll search!!!"
5,A story I'll never forget,"Home from college, I was sorting through numerous books I'd packed away years ago and came across this series. I dusted it off, flipping one page, then two, then the next book and the next...I loved this series as a child, and I'd recommend it to everyone as a great intro to fantasy. If you can get your hands on a copy- treasure it."
5,If only they were still available,"I read these when I was in junior high and loved them. They had beautiful covers (artwork by Rowena, if you can believe it!), and stories that fired a young girl's imagination.I've managed to find two of the six in used bookstores over the last several years, one of which is missing pages. The prices... are way outside the range I'm willing to pay for them. But I'd love to find the rest and complete my set!"
1,unhappy,It was advertised as a hardcover book... however it was not a hardcover. I was very unhappy with false advertising.
4,Very Nice Book and explores all different emotions,"I think this is a very good book because it has happy and sad parts and had a very good plot. Kirstin is a pioneer girl from Sweden who is coming to America to live on her uncle's farm. She has many hard times and makes many friends along the way. I have read all of the ""Meet the American Girl"" series except for ""Meet Molly"", and I believe ""Meet Kirstin"" was one of the best."
1,Simmons Customer Support is Horrible,"The drumkit performs o.k. but - Horrible company service. I purchased the Simmons drumkit on Dec 23 2009 and the kick drum stopped working on Dec 24 2009. Simmons acknowledged a defect in their drum pads on their website. I called and spoke to Gary at Simmons customer service and have not received any service or further communication. I have since called and emailed Simmons numerous times and cannot get ANY service from Simmons what so ever. I am writing this review on Aug 20th 2010 and still nothing from Simmons. Simmons has yet to provide any warranty service, if you're looking for a new drum kit look into another company with a better track record other than Simmons."
4,"Not as good as an acoustic set, but still good for the price","The reason other reviews are saying negative things about this set is because most drummers fail to acknowledge that you can't hit the pads too hard or they WILL begin to break. I opened the box christmas morning, easy to assemble, WAY more portable than my old acoustic set, I used this one in band practice today, my band mates love it. My only problem is the EQ of the 3rd tom, it doesn't make as much sound as the other toms. I fixed this by tampering with the individual drum volume settings. It works for me because i don't have much space in my house anymore"
4,Simmons electronic drum set,"The sound is very good, I was surprised, this is my first electronic kit, I am used to accoustic drums. The only thing I don't like is that I have to purchase an amplifier to hear the drums without my headphones."
3,Basic Overview of Police Firearms,"Starts off with a history lesson on the evolution of law enforcement in Europe and the U.S. and then focuses on the firearms used by the police. Some of the firearms covered include: S&W; and Colt revolvers, Remington shotguns, Colt semi-automatice rifles, etc...They cover about as much as you can fit into a 50 minute episode, which means it lacks a lot of detail. Would have been better if they discussed the evolution in training methods over the years."
1,Wrong Parts,"I Ordered this for a 1982 Suzuki Swtft GTI and now I went to install it, wrong parts! Now it's too late to return it."
3,"Great show, but don't buy from these crooks","$100??? Are the DVDs made out of gold? I saw other volumes on here going for $60 or more -- even that's ridiculous.Good Eats is a great show -- the best on Food Network, in my opinion -- but what these sellers are asking you to pay is absolutely absurd and completely unjustifiable."
3,a weird smell,That's the thing I have against this chin-rest; it has a weird smell that is not good at all. I have to put some perfume on it every week to be able to use it. Relating to comfort I would say is 3 stars.
3,read manufacturer warnings,"I've read several of the reviews here and just wanted to note that the manufacturer's guidelines for Pyrex baking dishes specifically warn that they are not safe for stove top use, oven temperatures above 400 F, and extreme temperature changes. When used within these guidelines, the chance of the dishes exploding is much lower. Pyrex baking dishes aren't perfect for everything, but they certainly have their place in the kitchen. I will agree, however, that they can be hard to clean."
1,Now I understand! My dish shattered too!,"I have used Pyrex bakeware for over 20 years, and I was shocked when my fairly new 9x13 pan shattered. I figured I just got unlucky and got a bad one. I was going to buy a new one - thank goodness I read the reviews first! And yes, I did follow instructions - I baked my lasagne at 350 degrees, did not use an open flame or broiler, etc etc. I can't believe this safety hazard is still allowed to be sold! I am so mad! I am switching to Corningware now."
4,"Nice dish, hard to clean though","These Pyrex dishes are hard to beat for the price. You have to be careful with them, however, because they can explode I highly recommend that whenever removing them from an oven to immediately place it on top of the oven to rest for a few minutes. That way you're more assured of it not breaking. I would recommend a pottery dish over this one though but if you're looking for cheap, this is it. But please be careful. You absolutely cannot take these from the fridge and put it in the oven. I guarantee it will explode."
3,"Exploded, but probably my fault","I roasted a chicken in a Pyrex pan and then put it on the stovetop to make gravy. I turned the burners on underneath it and brought the drippings and some room-temperature stock to a boil. Suddenly, kaboom!Okay, in retrospect, that was a really dumb idea. But I had always heard that Pyrex was specifically safe for this, and that made it better than other glass pans. Additionally, I had done this several times before.Bottom line: Pyrex is not safe for stovetop use. I will always use metal roasting pans in the future."
1,Exploding Pyrex,"I have been a chef now for seven years and have not ever had a problem with pyrex. Until now. Last night while roasting some potatoes in a 400F oven, my pyrex dish exploded. It rained glass all over the inside of my oven. It was a disaster. I am just thankful that nothing happened to me or my two year old who was in the room at that time. This sounds like a REAL PROBLEM!"
2,be CAREFUL,"I had a set of pyrex bakeware given to me as a wedding gift September '04. The 4X4"" pan exploded on me one of the first few times I used it. It had come directly out of an unmarred box, brand new, so I highly doubt that it was a handling issue. I'm a Ph.D. chemist so I know what to avoid when using pyrex, extreme temp change causes thermal stress etc... if there was a nick or scratch in it I wouldn't have been baking with it. I was not badly injured, but I see from doing a quick internet search (that landed me here) that some people have not been so lucky. Just be careful if you are using new pyrex bakeware. The sudden increase in complaints tells me that it could be a manufacturing issue."
1,Dangerous Pyrex,"My wife and I recently had a 13x9 Pyrex dish explode in the oven. The fire department came because the remnants of the dish caught on fire when the oil in the pan dripped into the pilot light beneath the oven. A simple web search afterwards revealed literally hundreds (yes, hundreds) of complaints about exploding Pyrex dishes. Consumer Affairs has been reporting the danger for years. Don't buy Pyrex."
1,Exploding Pyrex: Should Sue!,"Who's going to pay for the big burn marks all over my new wood floor from the exploding Pyrex pan? Yep, explosion, same as everyone else. Thankfully, my nine year old was not helping me make the lasagna as she often does. Then she could have easily lost an eye as it shattered into thousands of pieces, flying through the air. This product should be pulled and no longer sold. I am so furious. No, I wasn't doing anything wrong either except take it out of the oven and put it on the counter to cool. Do not buy this product unless you are willing to take a major risk to yoru health."
3,Deep dish casserole wasn't DEEP,"This was advertised as being deeper than what it turned out to be. It's a regular 9X12 casserole of which I already have several. I need one that is deeper than 2 1/2 inches for my enchiladas. Shipping was free and it was well-wrapped and arrived quickly. It will make a nice gift. This is a versatile dish and can be used for so many things...casseroles, cakes, fudge, brownies, or a serving dish."
1,Roasting pan exploded,"I had a terrible experience last night--a recently purchased 13x9 inch Pyrex glass roasting pan exploded after I took it out of the oven and set it on a pre-heated electric burner. Glass and food everywhere. I was fortunate, however--no glass on me, and only a few minor cuts.I know that these pans are not supposed to be used on the stovetop, but I never expected that they could EXPLODE. Seriously--there was glass 4-5 feet from the stove.Nearly all of my baking dishes, casseroles & pie pans are Pyrex. Some are over twenty years old. I have loved using Pyrex, and it was always my first choice for bakeware. But after this VERY frightening experience, I absolutely cannot recommend that ANYONE purchase the newer Pyrex glass bakeware, which is no longer made by Corning.If I could give it ZERO STARS, I would...."
4,"Pyrex is safe, and it's fantastic","I've been using Pyrex for as long as I've been baking. I use almost nothing else in my oven, microwave, and refrigerator. I've never had any problem with breakage of ANY kind. My idiot sister managed to break a piece by putting it on a hot stovetop burner (not an approved use), then pouring cold water into it. That will break any kind of glass, and will even warp cheap metal.I'd rate all Pyrex as perfect if it were a bit lighter, and if it were nonstick. As it is, nearly every piece of Pyrex out there gets four stars from me."
1,PYREX EXPLODES!`,"DON'T BUY PYREX!!!! pyrex has a tendancy to EXPLODE for NO REASON! I worked for World Kitchen (owns Pyrex) and got tons of cases where pyrex exploded for no good reason. preheated ovens with no significante temp change... normal use and care and it EXPLODES!!!DON""T USE!!!"
3,Fine for beginners,I purchased this books in hopes that I would find some unique swags. These are simple swags and would not be difficult for the beginner.
5,My favorite la Fave,"I heard him at Poor David's Pub 15 years ago or so. Road Novel is my absolute favorite. So good it makes me sing into my thumb much to the dismay of neighborhood cats. He is awesome, soulful and just makes you want to make out with someone! I love ""Into Your Life"" and ""Buckets of Rain"". It's been awhile since i have bought any of his other CDs (I have Buffalo and Trail but aren't as up to speed on them.). I think I am due for some new Jimmy. Love that soul, Jimmy...keep it up. The junk on the radio is just that....come see us in Dallas again."
3,"Good Musician, but . . .","First of all, I have never seen Jimmy LaFave live, nor is he my uncle so I can rate him, more or less, objectively. He has a great voice, good musicians and arrangements, but he seems to be still searching for his own style. I'll have to admit that I like his version of Dylan's ""Buckets of Rain"" but on most his songs he seems to be imitating rather than innovating. When [If] Jimmy finds his own style he could be great. Thanks for reading this."
4,"Ray's early works influenced by Nat ""King"" Cole","The early works of Ray Charles(avaliable in many collections)were culled from his Swingtime label 78's, mainly recorded in Los Angeles in the late 40's and early 50s. All are heavily influenced by the Nat ""King"" Cole trio. (Cole's early period in which he played jazz and blues in a trio setting and with the all-star Jazz At The Philharmonic groups. Ray and Nat both would later sell millions with smaltzy orchestrated pop ballads.Best of Nat King Cole Trio: Vocal Classics 42-46Cool Christmas Blues)Another key influence was Charles Brown, another uptown bluesman who played piano."
2,leave the drama and artsy prose for a novel!,"I was thrilled to get this book - autumn and winter are my favorite gardening seasons. I was hoping this would be a factual book, pumped with good horticultural information.What I got was a sappy book full of romanticized gobbledygoock and poetic prose. If I wanted to read a fictional romance novel I would have done so.If you want a ""just the facts"" let's get down to gardening type book, this is not for you. If you want a dreamy armchair book to read as you sip chablis in front of a crackling fire, whilst the snowflakes dance upon your frigid windowsill, then this may be for you."
2,Not the best,The colors are great but the quality not so much. I love that the comforter has 2 colors but becuase it wraps around the edge of the mattress it is not reversable. The sheets are NOT soft at all. Even fresh out of the dryer they are a wrinkled mess & very stiff. I was very diappointed because I really love the colors for my little mans room.
3,What is the use of the case?,"I find the weights convenient to use during workouts. The case is useless for storage as it will only close when the lowest weight is attached. To put weight in the case, one has to unscrew the higher weight used and screw on the lowest weight."
2,Heavyhands 1-2-3--not accurate weights!,"Amazon's description indicates there will be ""four 2-lb end caps"" and ""four 3-lb end caps"", and each end cap is labled with those numbers, but you will realize that the numbers only indicate what the ""total"" weight will be when those caps are applied to the handle. You are not getting four 2-lb end caps that each weigh 2 lb...they actually only weigh 1 lb each, resulting in a total of 2 lb for the 2-lb caps, for instance. Also when applying the two 2 lb end caps and weighing them on a scale, I found that the total result was only 1.91. When applying the two 3-lb end caps the total weight result was only 2.85 lb, and when applying the two 1-lb end caps the total weight result was only 0.87 lb. So overall...not accurate. Nice concept if the description was not deceiving and if the weights were actually accurate."
1,"Bought new, received used","This was fulfilled by Target. We bought ""new"" merchandise and received a package that had been opened, gear that had been used enough to be significantly scuffed up and worn, and then replaced in the original plastic package and taped closed with packing tape. Amazon was, as always, great about the return, but we will never again purchase online through Target, as this must be how they dispose of their store return merchandise."
2,"Bought from Amazon: Assumed new, received used",I would like to have known prior to purchasing this item from Amazon that I was buying a store return. The scuff marks on the weights made the obvious. The taping around the exterior of the package was an indicator as well.Heavyhands 1-2-3-Pound Multi-Pac Black heavyhands with Carry/Storage Case
3,Nice weights but not the right weight,The weights are nice but they are not close to the advertised weight. We have a laboratory scale at my company which is calibrated and certified so I know the following measurements are accurate. I also weighted other hand weights to see if everyone fudges on the numbers. Not so... Other hand weights weigh almost exactly what they claim. Not so for heavy hands... For example using the 2 lb setup: one heavy hand weighed 1 lb 13.8 ounces and the other heavy hand weighed 1 lb 14.4 ounces. So we are talking about them weighing about 7% less then advertised. You'd be very angry if that was prepackaged coffee or nuts you bought at the market and were cheated out of 7% of your purchase.So bottom line... I like the weights and I will keep them but I feel kind of cheated.
