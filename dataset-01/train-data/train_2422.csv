3,Equus Code reader,"Even though ordered at the same time, the other item ordered arrived promtly ( the next day ), this item took a week to arrive. Item appears staifactory."
5,Excellent,"for years on my 1995 f150 i struggled to count the beeps or the sweeps or the lights to get the error code number. all you have to do with this unit is plug it in, turn it on, and it automatically goes through the whole error code search and then displays and remembers all the error code numbers. no counting anything. i wish i had this years ago."
5,Equus 3145 Ford Digital Code Reader Works,"I had a problem with my 94 Ford Taurus 3.8l engine stalling after sitting for a few minutes. used the code reader to discover that one of my sensors was bad. After replacing the sensor I still had the problem. Although the reader The MAP was ok,I replace it also. The MAP was good and that did not solve my problem. The problem is that Ford recalled the fuel pump on the car in 1994. It was the cause of the problem. It causes the car to have an effect like a vapor lock. At lease the code reader save me from spending more money. I think it was a very good deal. It forced me to look for the problem some where else, Two thumbs up....."
1,Ford code reader,I am so so so dissapointed! I bought this for my hubby & once received it wasn't for our car year! I wish amazon would have it said in description!! So now I have to send it back and I am very annoyed.
4,works great!,Bought this code reader to use on my 1995 Ford Bronco. It works great! I am able to pull codes and issue tests on the vehicle.
5,Awesome!!,I am really impressed by this little guy..!! My mechanic suggested picking one up in lieu of counting the flashing lights and I'm glad I did..! Seems like its well made and I was surprised to find a thick instruction manual with all the codes and diagnostic help included!! The info in the book is very helpful and well written -- helps tremendously with diagnostic!Good buy!
3,Not for cars newer than 1995,"This may well be a very good product, but I wouldn't know because the Amazon description does not make it clear that this product is only for vehicles built between 1981 and 1995. Only if you zoom in on the picture can this fact be seen printed on the product.Apparently, before 1995, manufacturers used their own code system known as OBD1. After that time, OBD2 was introduced. This later coding requires a more sophisticated diagnostics reader with a new type of standardized connector and code system, but has the benefit of not being manufacturer specific."
2,Warning - Description on Amazon.com is vague,"Can't attest to the quality of the product, but the description on amazon.com is vague - I was very careful to match the reader to my vehicle (or so I thought) and STILL had to send this back and order a different unit for my '03 Ford with an OBDII system. amazon, as always, was great: gave me an electronic credit so I was able to order the correct unit and get it coming before I even shipped the original back."
3,Equus 3145 Ford Code reader,"This little gem assisted me with the diagnostics of my 96 Ford car. Before I bought this unit I was replacing parts to beat the band and got no further ahead with the exception of having lots of new unnecessary expensive replacement parts. After reading the instructions for 30 minutes and a 10 minute test, zeroing in on the trouble was now possible and the frustrating guesswork virtually over with."
4,A value code reader,Easy to use and easy to follow instructions. A great way to save some money for those mysterious alarms that pop up.
5,Awesome,This right here is classic 2000 techno with that classic Japanese clean sound. Mijk Van Dijk owns his craft and makes his best album. Wonderful driving music.
4,"Not as informative for older infants, but still a good reference","I bought this book when my daughter was 8 months old. It has a lot of information for ""pre-parenthood"" and when your child is a little older and walking. It gives good information about restaurants, where to shop, good parks to visit, hair salons,and what accommodations are available for children (changing tables, kid's menu, etc.) I was hoping to see more things for older infants. I was a bit disappointed to see that IKEA was not included in the guide. It's probably one of the most baby and kid-friendly places I've been to. For the most part, I'm satsified with the book.(Perhaps it should be called a ""kid guide"" rather than a ""baby guide."" Nevertheless, I'm sure I will be using it when my daughter is a little bit older."
1,What A Frustrating Item To Try To Buy!,"I would LIKE to buy some of this tape, but I select a color, then try to click to add it to my cart, but have a circle with a slash replace my cursor, and a note pops up to make a selection in order to add it. I give up! I'm going to another site."
2,Rather Shallow,"I've seen some superb productions in the Empires ""series"". Holy Warriors, however, is not one of them. To keep this short, I will just say that much of the film consists of slow-motion scenes of Richard, Saladin, or battles, while the voice over narrator gravely and dramatically intones his explanations of what we are seeing. Even the scholary comments by the academics don't seem to be able to contribute much to the story line. This documentary is a disappointing and rather superficial treatment of a great historical story."
2,Good production values but unfortunately bias account,"I have watched almost all of PBS's excellant empires series of documentaries. I have not been disappointed, until now.This is such a romanticised account of Richard the Lionheart. The writers were at great pains to paint a picture of a noble and selfless Richard. Filled with so much laughable spin, it excuses him of his cowardice (e.g. his retreat from attacking Jerusalem not once but twice) and his excesses (e.g. the slaughter of the 3000 arab prisioners).Saladin was painted as a ruthless man who did everything to obtain and retain power. The compassion he showed towards the Christian civillians after capturing Jerusalem was viewed with skepticism and negative spin.When an organisation like PBS start producing such an unbashedly bias and jaundiced documentary, it only shows the effect 9/11 has had on society. One can only hope that in the near future, fairer heads will once again prevail in PBS."
3,Empires - Holy Warriors: Richard the Lionheart & Saladin,A sobering documentary in light of the current state of world politics.
2,Not High Quality Scholarship,"This program is a far cry from the usually high quality scholarship you'd expect from PBS, I didn't even like the actors they cast for saladin and king richard, don't waste your time watching or buying this program other critics on this site have given references to other material on the subject which i plan to look into."
3,A decent yet partially biased account of the crusades,"This movie is a nice watch for anyone who would like to know more about the crusades. Its extremely well directed and provides the viewers with a clear analysis of the events that took place back then. However, I felt the movie was biased towards King Richard in certain ways. While his mission was shown of an entirely religous nature, for Saladin the viewer gets the impression that he was more concerned about maintaining his political status in the muslim world. The documentry does talk well about certain attributes of Saladin but misses out on the whole point of Saladin's efforts, i.e. Jerusalem is just as sacred for muslims as it has been for Jews and Christians."
3,Disappointed!,"I read the reviews on this DVD before purchasing it and they were stellar. However, I was enthralled with it until it reached the end; which in point of fact should have been the beginning. It ended... period... leaving me hanging. I went as far as to check out the rest of the cover to see if there wasn't yet another disc I forgot to play. I thought... man it can't have just ended now!How pathetic."
2,If you can't walk the walk...,"What did it in for me in regards to this album, was Amy Grant's personal life testimony. That pretty much made this album really shallow. It lacked the backing of the kind of life that should be behind christian albums.It's ""ok"" that she got divorced and remarried, if that's what she chose to do. Personally, I was crushed when I heard. But if you're going to live your life that way, please don't continue to preach and minister through christian songs. The stage that she's on is one that needs personal integrity and earned respect. But unfortunately, she doesn't realize that. I'm not really sure what made her think that she could pick up right where she left off.Life choices carry consequences. Everyone deserves mercy, just as God shows us mercy. But ministry carries a requirement for personal integrity and responsibility. You can't live your life however you want and still maintain your ministry of Godly song. And that's what makes this album so shallow."
2,"Great Hymns, Cloying Piety","Grant is an interesting performer who might have effectively introduced these wonderful old hymns to a new audience. Instead, her selections are excessively arranged, and her piety is cloying. Please, give us entertainment without the sermons, which are now less convincing than ever."
1,Did NOTHING for my spiritual side,"Not only was this album way below expectation - I felt as though this now old lady was trying to recapture her former glory. it was just .... bad. Very diappointing. I was expecting the old Grant. No real voice behind the music, which by the way is not quite sure just what it wants to be...am I a pop song? a gospel song? a country western song? El Shaddei was my most awaited. It was also my most disappointed listen.Don't waste your money buy it on the clearnace rack in a month or two.The whole CD just struggles!"
3,"I love Amy, but...","I've been a huge Amy Grant fan since AGE TO AGE, but I'm really disappointed in this collection of traditional hymns. Amy still has a warm, extraordinary voice, but there seems to be no sparkle and no joy in any of these renditions. Perhaps she meant this album to be quieter and more reflective, but the final effect seems to have sucked all of the life out of these wonderful songs. Instead of rejoicing, she actually sounds sad on most of the songs. I miss the spark of AGE TO AGE and hope she returns to that format very soon. Until then, I'm going back to listen to SING YOUR PRAISE TO THE LORD again. If ever there was a cause for rejoicing, it's our Lord!"
3,Okay....but good old hymns can stand on there own.,"I have been a fan of Amy's for quite some time now. i was very pleased to see that she made the leap back to here roots in this CD, however, i was disappointed when Amy decided to break songs up. ""It is Well"" would have been more beautiful on it's own. Amy also did this with some other selections which didn't seem to do justice to some of these very old hymns.Amy in my opinion did it right on the second CD of old and favorite hymns letting each song stand on its own. It was far more pleasing to listen to the second CD."
1,Legacy Hymns and Faith,I could not hear the words of the music. I was disppointed because I do like to listen to Amy grant.
4,A Good Collection,"Amy Grant has put together a group of hymns that are done in a modern way with a good sound.Two of the songs that I think that she did very well are 'My Jesus, I Love Thee' and 'Softly and Tenderly'. One song that I don't think that she should have attempted here is 'I Can Only Imagine'. Perhaps it is just that MercyMe has done such a phenomenol job on that one, but Amy's version is not a great one.Overall, I enjoy this album. For those who enjoy a modern sound, I would strongly recommend 'Redemption Songs' by Jars of Clay. It is really incredible."
4,Better than expected...,"This album takes a few listens and then begins to grow on you. I'm a fan of hymns more than a fan of Amy Grant, and that's why I purchased the album. I like some of the non-traditional ways the hymns are presented. It has somewhat of a country feel to it, as some reviewers have mentioned, and I think that's partly because of Vince Gill's influence (who is a superior musician in my opinion) and partly because Amy Grant seems to be going for a more Southern, sit-on-the-porch-swing kind of vibe for the album. I like that she picked some hymns that you don't normally hear in standard hymn collections. The two songs written and co-written by her, to me, are the weakest. I wish she would have put two more hymns in instead. Overall though, it is a good CD."
2,I really wanted to like this one,"I was thrilled when I first heard about this album. However, my excitement quickly faded during my first listen to this album. This project had great promise. In the past Amy was second to none at turning songs into classics. The biggest problem with this album is that it sounds DEAD. Amy used to sing with such conviction, passion, and sincerity. I didn't feel those qualities on this album.I think I would of also enjoyed this album more if she didn't incorporate so much country music into it. Several of Amy's previous songs had a touch of country in it (such as ""Tennessee Christmas"")and it worked for those songs, however I feel as if she went into blue grass/country overdrive here.I really wanted to like this one.On a side note..... Things did get much better on her second album of hymns ""Rock of Ages"", where she appears to have come back to life and move and inspire me with her songs once again."
2,Great if you like Vince Gill music,"I went into the store to buy an Amy Grant CD and I came out with a Vince Gill sounding CD. While it is nice to see an artist expand their horizons, this is too much twang for my taste."
2,Not So Good,"It's clear this forum is just like Amy's newsgroup -- if you dare to differ from the prevailing opinion, you are castigated and dismissed as irrelevant and mean.It just blows me away though, how people can give this project a 5-star rating. It must be because they are either diehard Amy fans or that they didn't grow up in church singing the old hymns. Truth is that Amy can't sing hymns, several of the ones on this album are butchered beyond recognition. I think she should stick with the light pop tunes that she had on HIM and HOL."
2,Better Luck Next Time,"OK, I've got to give Amy a ""B"" for effort, but otherwise this CD is a mixed bag. I do like ""This Is My Father's World"" (except for Vince's harmonizing) but not much else. On ""My Jesus I Love Thee"", the tempo is too fast and Amy seems to be gasping for breath at times. Probably my least favorite track is ""Softly and Tenderly"". Many of the reviews praise this song and its so-called ""haunting drums"" but I felt the drums were very awkward. Instead of the moving altar-call song it is meant to be, it sounded more like something you would hear in a desert biker bar at 3am.I really didn't like the places where Vince Gill sang harmony. Amy and Vince really don't harmonize too well. To be fair, something about Amy's voice makes it hard for anyone to sing along. I don't care for Vince's influence on Amy's music either. I'm glad that they are happy together but I hope that their future studio collaborations will be limited."
2,Not that great.,"I was overjoyed to find a new CD with classic hymns instead of contemporary fluff! Especially a CD with ""Softly and Tenderly"" -- my favorite hymn of all time. I like Amy Grant's voice for the most part, so I bought the CD. Bad move. Her voice doesn't suit the music at all, and vice versa. When the music starts out simple and upbeat, Amy's voice is low and drawn out. And speaking of ""Softly and Tenderly"", the version of it on this CD was almost enough to make me cry, and not for good reasons. Skip it!"
5,Uplifting and calming at the same time,"I LOVE this album. I have a 6 year old and she loves it as well. In this day and age when secular music is becoming so ""graphic"" it's nice to know that there is music out there that the whole family can listen to. My daughter sings along all the time. And it's nice that these old songs of faith can be heard and loved by a whole new generation."
4,Fresh Revival of Old Treasures...,"Amy's gone back to her roots in this album, and honor her roots she does quite well. The album is a wonderful blend of creativity and tradition, ranging from the jived-up Southern sass of ""Nothing But The Blood"", to the quiet reflection of ""Be Still My Soul"" and ""Softly But Tenderly"". The new songs are a pleasant addition to the mix, from the confessional ""What You Already Own"" to the slightly-rewritten ""Imagine"", made popular by new Christian group MercyMe. The album drags in a couple places, but overall it is a wonderful and distinctive addition to anyone's CD library."
2,Doesn't work with most of my products,"I purchased this for my USB racing wheel and my USB Flight system. The computer recognises both, but occassionaly they'll disconnect. On my PS3 my racing wheel works fine on it's stock short cord, but with the extension in use the PS3 won't even recongise my device."
4,Fine Jazz Singer,"I am a radio jazz DJ and one of my specialties is ""female jazz singers you may never have heard of"". I have a large number of quality vocalists in my collection, and Ms.Eckert is one of the very best. A fine jazz voice and sensibility. I only wish she would get some recognition so we could have some more of her music."
5,Very refreshing!!,"I look at home design's books constantly but have never felt compelled to actually buy one until reading Home By Design. The layout of various design options in this book is great for those who own homes and even for those who wish to own homes in the future. There were numerous suggestions on how to utilize any living space. The explanations weren't difficult to understand or patronizing to those of us that aren't interior decorators or architechts. The photographs are beautiful. The rooms in the photographs are spacious but not in a far fetched way that some home design books feature. By that, I mean that you could actually picture some of these rooms in your own home. I think it's important in home design books to make the reader feel comfortable. You don't want the book to have a fairy tale vision because it'll end up in a pile of books at some garage sale. I would definitely recommend purchasing this book. I will be keeping it as a reference manual in my personal library."
4,"Yo, Joe!",G.I. Joe has always been a mainstay in american animation ever since it's debut in the 80's. While the episodes are a bit random some of the best episodes are picked for the new videos. With this new box set we'll have 18 episodes on video. Start collecting now because this is the best time to remember this clasic!
4,Flight,"Dawn Over Kitty Hawk is a first class narrative history of the early years of flight, not only the Wright brothers, but skillfully weaving in the story of others. This is a first class story of the rivalry that existed as man tried to imitate birds and fly through the air with the greatest of ease. It is informative as well as entertaining."
5,Never give up!,"This is a fabulous classic underdog story. It demonstrates that the Wright brothers were not just ""man against machine"" in unlocking the mysteries of flight. The Wrights were also fighting against fierce competition, against other brilliant men, against accepted yet erroneous engineering standards, and against each other, sometimes, as they melded their own human, distant personalities into one for the cause.Tremendous contrasts accentuate the challenge. For example, Langley had the financial backing of both the Smithsonian and the Federal Government; the Wright brothers spent the money they made selling bicycles. Langley's launch device alone cost $20,000; the Wrights launch device cost $4 (that's four dollars). Others worked on heavier-than-air flight for decades; the Wrights solved the problem in 4 years.If you love stories of success based upon single-minded determination, you won't want to miss this one. Never give up!"
3,poorly constructed but cute if fixed,"the costume itself is cute. The hat is pretty flimsy and the neckline was sewn crooked as was the rope on the hip part. I took the neckline apart and resewed it properly and retacked the rope. Otherwise, the costume is cute and true to size"
4,Great Book for EVERY Classroom,"I am just learning sign language myself, but feel as if everyone would benefit from knowing a few words and letters in the most common sign language (in their area) so they can speak (or at least offer a word of kindness) to more people.The ideas in this book could keep children busy during indoor recess, while riding the bus to a field trip, waiting in line at the museum, or just a few minutes until class dismissal. The students would have fun and the added benefit of learning a new way to ""say"" numbers, letters, or words in ASL.Learn to Sign the Fun Way: Let Your Fingers Do the Talking with Games, Puzzles, and Activities in American Sign Language"
4,Cool,The book is fun. I found a couple pages where the answers didn't match the signs but it's still a fun book.
4,Sign fun,Has a lot of basic signs that are well grouped. Takes those signs and suggests games to play to reinforce the sign learning. Easy to use and fun as well.
1,never worked right,"I bought this unit after someone was raving about how wonderful it was on a message board. I have never been happy with it.First I tried using it to loosen up wallpaper for removal. The vapor wasn't hot enough to melt the glue nor moist enough to soften the paper.Tried it on tile grout..sure it cleans..if you scrub hard with the wire brush (which was trashed after using once cleaning grout)....but I can use a scrub brush and hot water for free.I felt the vapor coming from the unit was not nearly as hot as the description stated.Being unsatisfied, I called the company, I could pay shipping and repair charges if I wanted them to look at it. No thanks..they have enough of my money.So did I just get stuck with a defective unit? How can the other reviewers be so happy with theirs? The company needs to stand behind their product and be sure all units shipped are in proper working order."
2,Question of fact,How can we view findings about Jesus of Nazareth when there was no Nazareth at the time of Jesus. My readings conclusively tell me that Nazareth came into existance well after the time of Christ.
2,Disappointing,I loved the music in The Godfather; this compilation did not live up to my expectations.
4,profecionals detective handcuffs-black steel,"I THING ARE VERY REASONABLE PRICE FOR WATH YOU GET THE QUALITY ARE GOOD AND , DELIVERY EXELENT."
1,Altec Lansing's customer service is pathetic,"I purchased a set of these speakers after carefull consideration for my girlfriend. The controller for the volume both remote and hard wired lasted all of one day before failing. I promptly contacted Altec Lansing and they promised to send me replacement parts. After waiting for over two weeks I called them, only to find out they had not bothered to ship the part out. The agent told me he would try to ship it out overnight, which didn't happen. It is apparent that this is a company that has no consideration for their customers, so if this sounds like a good company to deal with then I encourage you to buy their faulty product."
1,Not so great,"It might be due to the size of the room and the limited spaces I have to place the subwoofer, but no matter where I put it the bass was very much overpowering. When I finally was able to position it so that the booming/vibrations weren't too distracting, just the volume of the low notes themselves was far too loud (even with the bass turned all the way down). If being used for certain movies or gaming purposes, the bass might be desirable. I was planning to use it primarily for music through an mp3 player, and the bass overpowered the vocals a LOT, pretty much defeating the purpose. I returned it, and am trying a different system."
3,is it really worh it?,"last year, i was using the altec lansing 641... until the bass stopped working on it. the company has been very supportive and gave me the new fx-6021.the satellites sounds excellent... and the bass is ""acceptable"".but recently... my bass started rattling... there must be some loose items in there... the noise can't be really be noticed unless it exceeds approximately 2/5 of its full capability...once the speakrs and placed lying sideways... i found the rattling noice reduced.the design of the satellites are awesome... while the bass looks somewhat dull... i would have to say that this speaker system is a bit overpriced for the kind of quality you get from these speakersover all, i like this system.. it's just that rattling noise.. it's so annoying~ (i've never read of other cases of rattling for this item from other reviews)"
5,As Crisp & Clear as Audio Fidelity gets!!!!,The Sound quality is simply impecable and unquestioned and if that's your goal you will achieve it. This is apparent in all sound ranges and through all music types. The price at $220 is a little high and keeps alot of people away. I think if it were in the $130-$170 range more people would be turned onto this item.
1,Very big BOOOM!,"Sound is too ""boomy"", it is not sound quality item. If you need it LOUD and dirty, it is Ok, if you need it PRECISE it is not it exactly. For $200 you can get pro studio monitors. The bass response may be cleaner, but the satellites sonically quite good. I listen to the symphonic, classical music mostly and it reproduces it with quality. I would like to see more even and flat friquency respronce."
3,"Pretty good, worth reading","Entertaining book, good and original story line. After finishing the book I got the feeling that something was missing, though I still reckon its worth 2.5-3 stars. I think there probably wasn't enough focus on the strengths and weaknesses of the main characters and when the last ""lock fire"" command was sent I didn't feel that the suspense was built up enough. Also as another reviewer has mentioned, the inter-racial conflict seemed to dissipate too easily. Overall though I enjoyed it and would recommend it as a good winter (or summer if you're in the North) read."
2,Incredible Bulk,"The case is well designed, but there is no way to use it with the executive belt clip case that comes with the phone. Thus, I have absolutely no use for the item, reducing it to nothing more than an overpriced piece of plastic. However, if you do not need to use the belt clip then the clear active case is a great purchase. It does the job it was meant to do, it protects the phone. It is easy to use and it does not get in the way of other features."
3,"Good Directions, Slow to Start","I just bought the Tom Tom Go, and I have to agree with several of the other users' comments. The directions, so far, have been very accurate. One complaint I have is that it DOES take awhile to get a satellite signal when I first turn it on. A couple of other problems:1. The instructions on loading the maps were not very clear, and customer service wasn't very helpful. I was finally able to figure it out, but it was a very frustrating experience.2. My suction cup does not stick to my windshield for more than a couple of minutes before it falls off. I haven't wanted to stick it to my dashboard because of others' comments about the difficulty of removing it, so I let it sit in my center console. This works as long as you are satisfied to listen to directions and you don't actually have to look at the map!"
1,TomTom has no service,"After less than four months, the battery in my TomTon GO failed. I discovered that the only way to file a claim for warranty service is by e-mail. That e-mail apparently goes directly to the dumpster. It took two weeks for any action to take place on the claim and then they just changed the status to ""solved,"" without offering any solution and without any communication.In my opinion, this is a company that has no clue what customer service is."
3,Good Machine if you do not need Customer Service,"Pro: High resoultion, excellent 3D screen, excellent Voice Direction, 256MB SD card enough to store from Virginia to Ontario, Canada.Con: Supspicious Customer Service Qulity (raised 2 questions and got no response). Wondering what to do if they do not honor the $50.00 rebate. No phone number to call either.You have to manually switch map between regions. e.g. if you want to go to Toronto, Canada from NY, you can only program the map to go to Buffao, after you cross over to Canada, you need to switch to Ontario region to obtain Satilite signal to continue toyour destination in Canada.Instructions to install new map to the card is not clear enough. Take quite a while to figure out.Support from their Website not much help either.Customer Service is priority to me especially for this kind of high priced product. However, if you don't care about customer service, I would recommend it."
1,Enormous disappointment,"I have had nothing but trouble since I purchased this unit during Jan. 2005. I was able to load one small map, fortunately, it was my home state but since then I have not been able to load anything else. I get error messages galore! There is no customer support that I can tell. I have sent questions which have yet to be answered and the web site is difficult to navigate. It does a fairly good job with the map that loaded. The 3D picture is pretty nice and it seems to latch onto satillites fairly well but the disadvantages of the unit outwiegh any advantage"
3,Not impressive at all,"Well.... I did my research before buying this product.I've been using it about a week. I can give 3 stars for this GPS device.CONS:1. No highway address can be located. You need to know a crossing road.2. It only calculates based on mileage. It does not have a highway only calculation mode. It will give you local roads all the way.3. be careful with upgrading. It may screw up the machine.I had to format the disk and re-do everything.4. Poor tech support. Don't even try during weekends5. Highway split is an EXIT?PROS:1. largest screen you can get for your bucks.2. Easy set up3. Rechargeable battery - good idea (but, not changeable)"
5,"Yes, indeed, TomTom has no customer service","I am yet another customer who has discovered that TomTom seems to have no customer service.NOTE. I don't know this particular GPS so my ""5 star"" rating is not meant to mean anything."
2,Great idea but poor execution,"I read all the glowing reviews and bought one of these units. It is a good looking piece of equipment in a nice package, but until I could not get it to find the satellites did I see the small package insert(obviously an afterthought) that pointed out that if you have a newer car that has a thermal windshield with radio antenna integrated you must buy the external antenna. That is what I did not want. Also, the print on some screens is so small as to be unreadable and direct sunlight totally blanks the screen. I don't know where the reviewers who said the screen was great in sunlight live, but it really cannot be seen in Texas sunlight.I sent mine back at my expense. I wish the manufacturer had identified the thermal winshield issue before I wasted my time. This is a good idea, but needs some more work."
1,Maps of Western Europe are incomplete !,"I recently purchased the maps of Western Europe to complement my Tom Tom GO as I was going to travel to Europe. However, this package is incomplete as it does not include the maps of ""Major Roads of Europe"" which needs to be purchased separately and is only available bundled with an SD card! This is unacceptable."
1,tomtomgo,device is not user friendly and cant get support via e-mailor phone . cant see in the sunlight
1,"Heavy, not very efficient","I thought this would be the best vacuum for my sot carpet and I loved that it is upright...but this thing is 1. super heavy around the head, making it hard to move around; 2. doesn't pick up all debris; and 3. parts get loose and are hard to replace...I do not recommend buying this vacuum cleaner!"
2,The only thing heavy duty about this vacuum is the price!,"We purchased this vacuum when our beloved Hoover was laid to rest after ten years of service. We wanted something that would last a long time and all of the usual household vacuums seemed flimsy. This vacuum is of equally poor quality. This evening, I sucked up a dried bean and the vacuum jammed, began to burn, and on top of it all, the power button isn't reliable so I wasn't able to turn it off quickly without running into the next room to unplug it.It doesn't suck up half of the debris that our Hoover did and it costs three times more than something comparable from a local department store that might have convenient features like a quick release cord, something I wish this one did with a 50 foot cord!"
5,GOOD STUFF FOR BONE INFECTION AND ARTHRITIS,"I HAD MAJOR INFECTION IN MY FEET WITH REDNESS AND SWELLING. THE BONES SORE TO THE TOUCH AND PAIN IN THE JOINTS. AFTER MAJOR ANTIBIOTICS MY FEET WERE STILL REALLY BAD OFF, SO I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT, AND GOT MORE MAJOR ANTIBIOTICS, AND IT CURED MY PROBLEM!!! GOOD STUFF FOR ARTHRITIS AND BONE AND JOINT PAIN. REALLY WORKS! FIVE STARS FOR ANYTHING MADE BY FUTURE BIOTICS!!!"
5,Packs a punch!,"What a great little guide! It's pocketsize, but it is crammed with useful information and pictures. I carried it in my purse the whole time I was in London, and referred it to it often. Really good if you are on the go."
4,snapshot of London,"This is good little guide for learning the basics about London and seeing what to expect through photographs. For an extended stay, you need something more comprehensive. I used a Lonely Planet: London to plan my trip, and then carried this one with me while touring the city."
2,An Incomplete History Lesson.,"One has to wonder if this is only a part of a series and they simply forgot to finish it...the first 20 minutes or so are devoted to the early years of the war which leaves less time to cover what is the central theme of this documentary, namely Hitler's increasing paranoia concerning the OKW and how his decisions shaped the final year of the war. This film takes you to Operation Market Garden (the attempted capture of Arhnem) and then abrupty ends. Such compelling events as the Bulge, Operation Bagration, and the defence of Berlin are not covered. Not a bad documentary, for example, the OOB comparisons of the Army of 1940 and 1944 were very interesting, but overall, it could have been so much more. Not recommended as a purchase but OK as a rental."
5,Great Biography of an Incredible American,"This biography gives an excellent portrayal of the life of George C. Marshall. It interviews those that knew him well and gives an impression of an underappreciated American hero. George Marshall should be remembered as one of the most important 20th Century Americans: along with JFK, FDR, and MLK. His integrity and service to the nation were just phenomenal. This video is well worth the 1 1/2 hours. I highly recommend it."
3,Mike Tramp has matured,"Mike Tramp was the lead singer in White Lion, an average band connected to the Hair Metal scene. Mike Tramp on his own is more interesting and he has left most of the past behind him. Just like Joey Tempest from Europe (""The final countdown""), Mike Tramp has matured in a way as he went solo, and the music is not pop metal or even hard rock anymore. ""Recovering the wasted years"" is a good effort and musically it bare connections to Joey Tempest's ""A place to call home"" as well as to Tom Cochrane's ""Ragged ass road"", or in a way even Jimmy Barnes' ""Freight train heart"". Some of the songs are very good indeed, like the opening ""Falling down"" and the fast and catchy ""Don't take my rock `n' roll""."
4,Typical Mike Tramp solo material.,"Good effort by Mike Tramp. If you like White Lion, his solo efforts are a little different, but still the song writing is good and the songs are good. I like most of his solo records."
5,Fun Thanksgiving read!,"One of those books that's funny for adults as well as kids. If you're looking for a funny Thanksgiving book starring a turkey family, this is it!"
3,Luke Short Wrote a Good One Here.,"A civilian wagon train carrying new Army repeating rifles with a small cavalry escort has to cross the Arizona desert on the way to Fort Whipple while facing the relentless heat, lack of water, a gang of outlaws trying to steal the rifles and the wraith-like Apaches defending their homeland. My only criticism: not enough gun fighting. Good, strong character in Dave Harmon, owner of the freight company and former Army officer."
4,Banking in the Global Village,"A story of an international banker-detective-phlospher as he contends with financial highjinks, a murder, and a kidnapping in several countries of South America. A very good read, actually quite educational, with a lot of current techniques and lore about international finance."
5,Wow!,"I love this scope! I've searched the web for hours and at my last ditch attempt I found this. I've got a friend that owns this, and I had a try. It was incredible! I've got a Edu Science 100X to 750X but, frankly, anything I wanted to view over 450X was most dissapointing. I couldn't get enough of it! Some people might think I'm nuts rating this so high but for a microscope this price its amazing. The other products by Meade seem pretty good too."
1,Feeder,It still has not arrived and I have no way of tracking it. Almost 30 days after ordering. Will let you know.
3,NOT as bad as some people claim.,"OK.....Some of the lines drawn on the pictures can be confusing, but the style is quite accurate, although it is very relaxed in the respect of effort in stances, with for example the turn into chicken stance in Beng Quan being almost upright instead of being low like the dragon, but this maybe due to stylistic differences than sloppiness.An interesting book in that the english text is translated directly from the Chinese text, with some very interesting useage of words.Buy this for your collection, but not necessarily as the best reference."
2,Not all that good.....,"I've practiced xingyi for a couple of decades, and like to pick up whatever books come out (in English) on xingyi.This one is just 'ok', if, and really only 'if', you already have a fair grasp of xingyi to begin with.It serves as a reminder of sequence, with little more to add."
1,It's good for one thing,"If you are already studying xing yi, you have knowledge of what is in this book. If you are away from an active practicing environment with other practitioners, this book will at least serve as a list of what a lot of what you'll want to remember. You couldn't learn from it, but it could keep you from forgetting."
3,NOT purple as shown!,"This is a beautiful crystal, however, it is not at all the purple as shown in the photo. It is almost completely clear, except for a very faint lavender tinge at the very top. It is so faint that I actually thought it was a clear crystal sent by accident, until I put it in the sunlight and saw the bit of light purple at the top. Still a lovely crystal for a great price, but you should be prepared for more of a clear crystal than the over-all purple as depicted. ;)"
2,it had a crack,"I ordered a white and a purple crystal, when I received my crystals, the white crystal was perfect, but the purple crystal had a crack. The hole in the purple crystal was also not drilled properly, and that area is partly chipped away, and I am not sure if this can be used.I don't think the damage/crack happened during transit because it was packed really well, and it looked more like manufacturing defect.I decided not to return the crystal because I don't want to waste time and money for shipping back something that I purchased for $3.50, but I am disappointed that the crystal was not checked before it was packed for shipment."
1,Not Purple at all!,I ordered 2 of this purple Crystal thinking they would be as shown in the picture. Not at all!! They are a faint lilac. It is not fair to claim a certain product in the picture and mail to buyer something else. this is dishonest. I will contact seller and update with how the seller will handle the return/replacement of this item.
3,Vintage Crystal Purple Feng Shui Ball 40mm,A medium purple but definitely a purple- it is glass.Well made. Good price. Bought as a to-go-with gift...Packaging is cheap. No string/fishing line comes with it.Hard to really think or tell actual size -suggest you use a tape measure.Would still recommend.
2,badly made!,I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT A $[...] MODEL WOULD BE MADE BETTER THAN A MODEL THAT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS MADE BY A CHILD!!!!!!!!!
4,Fun Read!,"This was a good story. I didn't really know what I was getting into, I had read The Book of Luke first and decided to get this one, even without really knowing what the premise was. I wasn't disappointed.I found myself glued to the pages for the most part. Neither Vanessa or Reed were happy with the situation and both would have rather things stayed the same instead of change.Vanessa seems to have hit lots of problems in this book. Not only does she have a half brother who is coming to stay with them, he's also famous. And that doesn't help when everything else hits the fan. But it was a good coming of age story and seeing Vanessa grow up a bit and make choices that would result in change (which she is terrified of) it was a book that was a pleasure to read."
4,pretty good!,"i honestly kind of liked the book, but it wasn't amazing. i do understand that it wasn't going to be perfect, but i think that i expected more from the book.while the plot line was actually okay, some things did bother me. vanessa is supposed to be this super-smart girl, but there are times when she is honestly just plain dumb. also, the story was fairly predictable, and i didn't feel that there were many exciting twists in the story. some parts bored me a lot... otherwise, it wasn't a bad read."
3,Doesn't hold a candle,"The first two movies were hilarious, this one seemed lacking. While there were some very funny parts it just was not a good way to end the movies. It was funny, but it could have been way better."
4,Very Funny,My husband and I enjoyed this movie. It was very funny and had a great storyline. Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller are hilarious and so is the little boy. I would recommend this movie but not for young children as there are some parts of the movie that are not appropriate for children.
1,Meet the Remote Tester,"The only good thing about this movie was that I got to make sure the fast forward, skip, stop and eject button worked on the remote control."
2,Juvenile,"The first installment of the series was mildly funny, but with each episode that followed, the plot descended further into juvenility. Enough already. How many jokes can be done with the family name? This has all the humor of a sixth grade boys locker room after a gym class.DeNiro, Hoffman and Streisand are better than this. I'm sure they liked the salary, but they are not enhancing their reputation as actors with this."
1,A horrible sequel,"We really liked this series and looked forward to this movie. To be blunt, this is the worst movie that we've seen in a very, very long time.1. The filming technique is just horrible. Imagine a cheaply made soap opera, not a really movies. Angles, lighting, etc were nauseating.2. The jokes were crude, unoriginal, and just plain stupid.3. There is no coherent story line. Just a string of crude 'funny scenes' patched together.We don't like writing bad movie reviews since the topic is so subjective, but this movie is just horrible."
3,so so,The only reason I watched this movie was to keep up with the previous sequels but as sequels go they weren't as good as the first but not totally boring either.
2,A classic example...,"...of going to the well one too many times. The first 2 in the series were genuinely funny. This one seemed completely forced. There were a few chuckles, but no real laughs. The plot was thin, the storyline predictible, the acting sub-par -- an amazing thing when you have actors of this caliber in most key roles. Watch it on cable."
1,Pitiful,This was a complete waste of my time. I am so glad I didn't see this at the theatre! I kept asking myself when it was going to be over. Really-Really-Really painful to watch. It makes me so sad because I actually liked the other two films. What a shame.
1,Honestly The Worst Movie I have Ever Seen,This one was so bad that I had to shut it off. I have seen the previous ones but this one was just bad. It just went back and forth with stupid things. I will never recomend this movie to anyone to watch.
2,Horrible part 3 to Meet the Parents,"I didn't like it at all, the story was pathetic. The only good thing is that the actors are great but they should've come up with a better story."
3,It's okay.,I really thought with this all star cast it would be better. It was funny but a lot of it seemed like recycled humor. I am giving it to a friend and telling them to pass it on when they are finished.
1,That's 90 Minutes I'm not getting back of my life,"It was the daily special for 99 cents, so I figured I'd try watching this movie. Wow, I can't believe this all star cast would bother with a third movie that was this unfunny and unoriginal. At least I didn't pay movie theater prices to see this junk."
1,Worst movie ever ! ! !,"This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen... I did not laugh once. I couldn't finish the movie it was so sick and unfunny... It was so poorly written and acted by all. I don't understand how this movie ever made it to the screen and how any of these class Actors were stupid enough to even let it get released or worse yet, how could they have been so dumb to even read the lines and then think they were funny... they must have needed extra money to pay their Servants or something.... I tell you, Hollywood really takes us all for the suckers that we can be at times... thank goodness we can share our opinion... If I were them I'd fire their agent, I could get them better roles than that, geez..."
3,"Hmmm, not bad","Ok it had some funny scenes, but not to be considered a hilarious movie by all means! Meet the parents was the best of the series, I just wish some people wouldn't decide to make sequels as the quality certainly drops with each following production."
1,Nothing like the first two movies,This movie was nothing like the first two movies.....it was not funny at all....I rented it from the redbox so I am glad I only wasted $1
1,Not a good sequel.,"I thought that this movie was going to be as good or better than the other two which I liked very much. But, MAN was I wrong! This movie is boring, and not like the other two in spirit. This one went back and forth on idiotic, not well-thoughout scenes. I don't recommend this to anyone."
2,Ripped Off,Just purchased this item in June and while I'm happy with the movie I was blown away today when I tried to download the digital copy in iTunes only to find that the code has now expired just 2 1/2 month after buying this. It might not be worth the extra money for the BR/DVD/DC if the digital copy is worthless.
1,"Awful, Awful, Awful sequel","This sequel absolutely ruins the first two movies in the series. If you are expecting hilarity as was in the second movie with the baby drinking vodka, etc. you will be sorely disappointed. The kids are too old, not funny and the endless storyline about viagra is not amusing either. It isn't funny that DeNiro has a heart condition and collapses either. There really isn't anything redeeming about this movie whatsoever. Save your money."
4,A great part of this series,A fun finish to the seris. Unless they are deside to do one of the kids grown up should be done. I hope so cause it looks done. So I think it it done so could be wrong but I do not think so.
3,Skip it unless you have nothing else to watch,This is far from being as good as the first one. Watch the trailer if you want to see the funny parts of the movie.
2,A Waste of a Talented Cast,"Everyone is back and they easily slip back into their roles but they are all wasted since the movie offers no fresh ideas at all. Jack Byrnes (De Niro) once again doesn't trust his son in-law Greg Focker (Ben Stiller), this time he thinks Greg is cheating on his wife Pam (Teri Polo). While Greg once again tries to prove himself to Jack, but fails miserably. Greg also has to compete with Kevin Rawley (Owen Wilson) for the love of Pam....once again.On top of all the old material all over again you have the film trying to get laughs with puke scenes, farting, fingers in butts, needles to penises and Greg cutting his finger with blood squirting all over his family. If a writer has to use any of the above to try and get laughs, it's clear that they are a desperate for laughs. I chuckled like 4 or 5 times and the film is at least a little touching in the end. But still, Little Fockers needs to be the last Focking movie!"
1,worst of the 3 meet the parents collection,movie is very slow not very funny at all and looks ike this movie was put together very sloppy hope there done with this movie. i would the 3rd movie is the worst by far and the 2nd one was'nt that good
2,Not worth the money,"I found that in order to get decent results, you have to cook at least 4 cups of rice. Since it's just my husband and myself, we find that we have to use the warm function frequently. If you keep it on the warm setting for an extended period of time, the rice gets too dry. We've also tried turning it off and them hitting the warm setting right prior to eating and found it to be spotty.We've only have the cooker for less than a year and the seal is no longer functioning properly. The rice doesn't get cooked completely. I've had other cookers that have lasted us for over a decade, so I'm extremely disappointed with this machine."
2,Poor quality,"The non-stick coating in mine started to chip off after only a few months(less than a year). It needs to be replaced after being used for one year since the bottom of the non-stick pan is in a really bad condition. Not a good quality product. I have used other rice cookers before and this one has the shortest life span as far as the non-stick coating is concerned.There is also a bug in the delayed timer. If you set it to 1 hour, it is acturally about 15 minutes. The subsequent hours are fine. For example, the cooking begins after 2 hours and 15 minutes if you set it to 3 hours."
4,Thrilling Suspense,"Don't Say a Word is an in-your-face novel that practically reads by itself. Although the dialogue is often laughable and the characters are paper-thin, the hundreds of twists and turns are enough to keep you entertained well past your bedtime.A psychologist's daughter is kidnapped by men who pretend to be able to see everything the shrink and his wife do. They want to get a number from a psychotic patient of the good doctor, a number which, of course, will bring them to a loot worth millions. The doctor has only a few hours to get the number and find his daughter.The race against time plot is always entertaining. The action is non-stop and the finale is beyoung belief. This is a book you just can't put down. The plot lets you forget that the author has no real style of his own and that the dialogue is often horrendous. This is one novel that satisfies its reader from beginning to end."
4,What do you expect?,"Ask yourself what you want of this book. If its an entertaining, reasonably suspenseful timekiller you seek, then this is a great choice. It's an old book experiencing a (slight) renaissance due to the release of the Michael Douglas movie. I would rather pick my own eyes out with a grapefruit spoon than see that movie but the book is the source and introduces a flawed psychiatrist and his small family and then subjects them to psychotics of every stripe. As a parent, I feel compelled to warn adults with children in the house that the novel preys on basic child-kidnapping fears. But you already know that, don't you? The ending is a bit pat and the improbable seems to trump the likely at every turn. Even so, it's a nice little romp, sort of thriller lite. It is particularly effective in its compression of time and its varied perspectives. If you've ever wondered about the mind of a psychopath, Klavan will gladly oblige you a peek."
3,"Good beginning then bogs down, characters & plot over the top.","Recently read and LOVED Klavan's ""True Crime"". Disappointed with this book. Started out interesting and seemed promising as the scenario and characters involved in the kidnapping of a little girl developed, but it got too bogged down and went on and on, seeming to go over the top with both characters and plot. You know where the story is going but it just takes too darn long to get there."
2,Like wading in sewage,"Like another reviewer mentioned, this book dwells on some very sick behavior and holds out the carrot of a tortured child to spur readers on.I liked it in the beginning, when the main character was coherent and the cliches were far between and few. Then comes the kidnapping and emotional diarrhea bursts forth. Sorry. But it does. Now come the gasps, the repetitions, the ""...""s, the frenzy of desperation and, for no particular reason, a cop who endlessly emits smelly farts. That joke grows old really quick.At times this story came across as a video game or psychopathic ramblings. I had to skip the frantic interior monologues that went on for pages and took up whole chapters. NOT believable and wearisome as well.I heard the movie was good. Go see it."
1,Contrived and predictable.,We are supposed to be kept interested wondering what the magical number is. I was not. The characters are un-believable and dislikable. The writing is dreadful and cliched. The climax has been repeated in a million movies. Did you believe it?
1,"stupid, stupid book","believe me... the book is not worth reding.I got the book because the movie sound interestingbut there wsn't much of a suspence in ithorror, the horror"
1,Don't waste your money.,"I was looking for a nice cucumber toner because the one I used for the last few years is no longer being made. I received this product very quickly, and tried it. I thought huh, I guess I got my face really clean with my face cleanser, because nothing came off on the cotton pad with this product. After a couple days I decided to use the cheap toner I had previously purchased at Target after I used this product. Now mind you, I used this product first, then used the super cheap toner from Target. Nothing was on the pad after using the cucumber toner. I then used the cheap toner. The pad with the cheap toner was brown with residual make-up! (my make-up is brown). All that was to say that this product was a big waste of money! I'll be using the toner from Target."
5,What a great book for anyone interested in ATM,"I was thrown into a situation a week ago where I need to come up to speed very quickly in ATM topologies. Cisco ATM Solutions answered all of my questions.The step-by-step introduction to the ATM design made for easy for me to brush-up on ATM principals, and the back of the book with actual designs was great.This book is perfect for the first time ATM'er as well as the seasoned CCIE. A must have in anyone's telephony technology libary."
2,I have to Disagree,"After purchasing this book a year ago, I am about 400 pages in and totally frustrated. It is like a collection of white papers about ATM theory. Sure, good info, but I want to know how to IMPLEMENT and design ATM networks. The writing style is awful -ex. ""the partner agrees on this, that, and the other stuff"" (pg. 140). The English usage is suspect at best, leaving the reader with impression that a number of writers had their hands on this one, and that many had English as a second language. While there is some good info in here, as well as some lab exercises, a solid, well-written book on ATM has yet to appear. After about 500 pages of this, you won't even consider putting this technology into your WAN -it comes accross as an administrative nightmare, obtuse, arcane, and altogether incomprehensible."
3,Almost there !!,"Nicely written & very informative.Though I was left with a lot of knowledge of the terms / build up of ATM ... I just did not get a real good enough 'grip' on this subject by reading this book !! Considering the reviews that this book already has from other readers, I'm sure I must be just the exception !!"
1,A Lot Of Fluff and Poop,"This book is too fluffy to have any significance in the life of a parent or child. Let's talk, instead, about how the kid wakes up and passes gas all over the house, or how a mother has to work 3 jobs to support the kid's cereal-eating obsession. The kid that reads this will laugh....as the little toy he ate earlier on drops out in his stool."
5,"GET IT, GET IT, GET IT!!!!!!","This is a KILLER! And very hard to find!!!! This is ""Puntillita"" on 1960's recordings and a few 1970's things he did with a big band. ABSOLUTELY SWINGING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Don't pass this one up!!!!!Mark / silverspurr"
1,Voyage,"I would not buy this CD if it wouldn't have been for the one and only song I always been listening to ""Voyage Voyage"". Its great song but the rest of them I didn't like. Besides they were (most of them) in French"
1,Oops! Viz did it again,"To any fan of Konjiki no Gash Bell, do not buy this manga. Viz Media has edited what could have been great. All of the names are either completely changed or shortened. All the names of the spells are shortened. Viz would even dare to mess with the artwork and give undearwear on ""Zatch"" in the beiginning of the book. Well Viz, I give you 1 star for this one. This is not what Makoto Raiku wanted us to see, and I would highly recommend watching the fansubbed episodes of the TV series instead of this manga on [...]."
5,my name is zatch.zatch bell.,"this manga is awsome.i got it today and its the first teen book that ive read.its about a battel to be king of the mamodo world if you like humor and magic you love this book!also recommend et cetera,legendz,rave master,and hikuru nogo"
1,Awful,"This was probably the poorest written book I've read in many years. It was especially disappointing as the subject matter is so topical, and it should have been fascinating. Unfortunately, the writing style is so stilted and shallow that I found myself not caring what happened - just let me get to the end. There is no attempt at character development; everyone is either a cliche or paper thin. Events happen haphazardly and are never tied into a later event. Don't waste your time or money, just read the newspaper."
5,A thriller to the very last page.,"Not since Rainbow Six have I read something so frighteningly realistic. Non stop action from page 1 keeps you captivated. With twists and turns abound, Max provides a look into the minds of those who fight against every American. Eerily forecasting previous months events, it almost seems if Max had access to information that the CIA, FBI, and NSA did not. It is unfortunate that terrors such that Max describes have unfolded, but his amazingly accurate story telling shows that just because it is fiction does not mean it can't come true."
2,Don't buy this from Amazon!!!,"I very much wanted four burner covers. I ordered them and was excited to get my shipment, although all four were chipped. So..amazon nicely told me to send it back for a replacement. However, the replacements were also chipped! After requesting a third replacement, Amazon refused to send another shipment saying they had to investigate their shipping of this product. They did offer a refund, but weeks later, I had no covers.I finally ordered them directly from Pfaltzgraff for a dollar more per item. It was worth the four dollars, as the items were packaged correctly. As I read other reviews of Amazon's shipping of Pfaltzgraff, I will be hesitant to order fragile items from them. It seems this is an overall problem they have not resolved."
1,Arrived chipped!,I ordered 4 burner covers and upon receipt found two of them to be chipped. The box they were packed in was partly crushed and there was only one thin layer of packing material with none placed between the covers at all. I am awaiting a reshipment of the two chipped covers and hope that Amazon will do a better job of packing. If not I think I will follow the advice of the other poster and buy from Pfaltzgraff directly.
2,Handle broke almost immediately,"Nicely designed pack, but a little plastic part that connects the rolling handle to the bag broke on the very first trip I took with it. Thus, when I pull the handle out, only one side connects with the bag anymore."
2,size issues,"Size is longer than advertised and wheels are underbuilt and not engineered properly. I'm sticking to Samsonite which is beefier, carry on ready and fabricated by a company that really knows how. Rick, stick to your excellent travel writing."
1,"Poor construction, did not last.","My bag's zipper handle broke the first time I used it. Then the rubberized handle wore off within about 6 months. At month 11 the trigger to collapse the handle gave out and I needed to replace the bag. I travel a lot, but getting less than a year out of a rollaboard is bad. I've gotten four times as much life out of bags costing less. Take your money elsewhere."
3,Helpful,I think that this book offers some easy excercises that you can do. The pictures are easy to follow and the explanations are simple.
4,User-friendly with lots of pictures,"This book acts like an exercise guide. It has smooth pages wtih nice black and white pictures depicting each exercise. The short descriptions on ""how to do the exercises"" is precise and to the point. Exercises center around the neck, back, torso, hip, wrist,chest, arms, and abs. Minimal equipment is required. Most exercises are done on a mat or a chair. Other accessories are easy to obtain: light weights, pillow,rubber ball, and such. I found this book very useful and easy to follow. The exercises are fairly easy and most anyone can do them. There are programs designed for people sufferning from osteoporosis, osteopenia, and the prevention of such. I found this extremely efficient because my mother and I can use the same book for her treatment and my prevention."
1,Don't be fooled by the title,"As a clinician-scientist, I believe in evidencebased medicineThere is no evidence base to support the work-outshown here to my knowledge have been provento build bones as opposed to other typesof exercise. As scientist from respected institutionlike NASA can tell you, the only most importantway the body needs to stimulate bone buildingis periodic weight-bearing exercises & stepping.The same view is shared by neurophysiologistsof NIH of USAThis kind of title is extremely misleading& should be taken with a grain of salt"
3,Powerful Images,"The images in ""Stolen Dreams"" are powerful. The expressions on the children's faces and the looks in their eyes make up exactly the expression of the title of the book. I would have liked to see more in depth investigation into the problem of child labor-- causes, reasons, problems, solutions, advocacy groups, challenges, etc. of which admittedly there is some discussion about. However, as I'm doing research on the topic, I bought the book with the mindset that this would be more about images than thorough information about the problem. So, the author accomplished what they were after perhaps. Good illustrative work."
3,"Are Aliens Among Us? (wink, wink, nudge nudge)","This supposed ""report"" about alien contact begining in the 40's and coming to a head in the late 70's is more farce than fiction. Instead of using the tried and true method of writing an SF novel, Siegel and Butterfield, along with designer Jean-Claude Suares, put together something that looked real enough to make you think twice at first glance. Upon closer reading, however, you notice the little touches that only the Sf fan could provide - a reference by then President Carter (in a faked memo) to someone beating the Wildfire team at flag football or the visiting aliens wanting to take TV personality Robby the Robot back to their home planet. A curiousity at best but hard to find intact as most of the trade paberbacks from the period have bad glue that has gone brittle and pages fall out all over the place. Worth a look if you can find one."
1,Hahaha,This book is for internet retards or complete newbies....*I* could have written this book and it's 32$ I would be rich...hahaha
1,Really?,What is this made of? Solid Gold? How the hell can this be this expensive? For a price tag of $999 this shoud come with a ton of extra stuff. Like a lifetime's supply of knives and ninja weapons.
2,A good opera ruined by the staging,"Musically this is a very nice (but not outstanding) opera. However the staging and direction detract from it. One rather uninteresting set (it looks like a waiting room with a few chairs, a water cooler (from which cast members frequently get drinks for no reason) and a newspaper rack (the cast frequently reads newspapers which is probably more interesting than watching the action on stage) serves as a hall in Westminster, the duchess's private chamber, and a cell in the Tower. Costumes are not very fashionable modern dress.The best way to enjoy this performance is to close your eyes."
1,Avoid PCMover - it's terrible,"My experience with PCMover was horrible, when using it to migrate from an XP system to a new Win 7 Pro 64-bit computer this last week. It was only about 70% effective (some of that was due to program incompatibility), but it's biggest sin was the effect it had on the Windows Firewall. Now that could be a Windows problem (no surprise there) but forums talking about this particular issue that disables the firewall showed that many of us had one thing in common, we used PC Mover to migrate.And when I went to fix my old XP system, I used it again to create a ""moving van"" which was saved on a removable drive. It was incredibly slow and even restoring it back onto a fresh XP disc volume resulted in bunches of problems with apps.Sure, if you want to transfer data only, no problem. When it comes to apps, though, it messed up my Windows installations and dropped the ball on my software. I'm looking elsewhere next time."
1,Not worth the money,I downloaded PCMover Professional and was very disappointed with the results. I tried moving the software and documents using a USB cable and only a few of the applications moved successfully. Then I tried moving using an external hard drive and this only produced an error. It would be better to just move your documents using an external hard drive and reinstall the applications.
2,Not What I needed,"I recently purchased this item for my Fiance to move his programs from his old laptop to his new desktop. Instructions didn't seem very clear, and he ended up having to uninstall/reinstall several times. The programs my fiance uses for work are very large; to be honest I wasn't expecting this software to really move everything. It did however move some of the programs from the old laptop to the new desktop... Overall it was not what we wanted and not what we needed. Someone else may however benefit from it."
1,NOT GREAT FOR XP TO VISTA,"MAY BE GOOD FOR XP TO XP, BUT SINCE NEW SYSTEMS WITH XP ARE NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE TO GET, IN MY OPINION THIS WAS A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. IF I HAD ONLY WANTED PHOTOS AND FILES MOVED, I COULD HAVE DONE THIS ""THE HARD WAY"" WITH CDS OR DVDS, WHICH WOULD HAVE TAKEN ABOUT THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME (AND LESS MONEY) AS THIS COST ME..... HOPE ANYONE ELSE BUYING PCMOVER IS MORE SATISFIED WITH IT THAN I... GOOD LUCK!"
1,Don't do it!,"Dreadful experience from start to finish. The transfer failed 5 times with the rather unhelpful error message ""PCmover has encountered and error and needs to close"". On-line support instantly suggested enabling logging at both ends, trying it again, and then sending the log files to the developers who would be in touch in ""a day or so"". Obviously I wasn't the first fool to pay them to help them develop their product.The value proposition is the product will save you time and effort, and is therefore worth spending the money on. The reality is you don't save any time, and you still spent the money. My advice would be to save your money, spend more time looking for your original disks, and move manually."
2,Be CAREFUL about using this software,"I used the new version this software to transfer from a computer with Vista to a new one with Windows 7. I'm not super computer savvy but I'm pretty good at moving from one computer to the other. I did everything I was supposed to do and the transfer took about 6 hours. The problem was that I was moving from the 32 to a 64 and iTunes got corrupted in the transfer. I couldn't uninstall, reinstall - or do anything - and I need it for my phone. After 3 hours of phone time with tech support (for iTunes, not the software), we all admitted defeat and I had to restore the new computer to factory settings, start completely over, and make the move manually. I'm not saying this was the software's fault, it may have been a function of moving from 32 bit to 64 bit but I will never again use software to move programs. Files yes, programs no. The whole experience cost me the price of the software and about 12 extra hours of time."
1,Don't buy this product,"Buyer Beware! Before you buy this product download the 20 page user's manual and read page 2.You will find out that it is not so easy. Laplink's marketing states that ""Simply install PCMover on both your old and new computers and go!"" Not so!After I read the user's manual, I saw how complicated it really was so I waited until I knew I had a day to try the software. I waited a few months to block out the time and tried it and gave up. This was after the 30 day return policy. However, I didn't download the software until the day before I requested the refund.Buyer Beware. I tried to explain my problems and concerns and asked for a refund. All I got was a ""stone walling"" support staff person named ""Bobbie Anne.""I suggest you write the files you want to move on disc or other storage device and move it to your new computer. Good luck!"
1,More harm than good,"PC Mover was fairly easy to use, but was worse than useless. It successfully migrated a few simple applications, but not the more complicated ones. It left the PC in a state where I could not install over the failed apps to fix them, nor could I successfully delete them to reinstall from scratch. Lots of time and effort down the drain, not to mention the steep price."
3,"PC Mover is OK, but not perfect","I purchased this software to move from my data from a Windows XP computer to a new computer with Windows 7 Home Premium. It was very easy to use and it di a fair job of moving my data. I did have some problems on the new system and had to completely delete a user id that it had brought from the old computer and redefine it. The problem was Microsoft Outlook related.I would not recommend this product for use by a novice computer user. If you know your way around in Window, then you should be able to use this product and fix whaever it did not do correctly.I used this software and the software supplied with Windows 7 to finally get all of my data transferred."
1,Wasted time with PC Mover Professional and Upgrade Assistant,"Hoping to move my notebook from XP to Windows 7 as an ""in place"" upgrade (multiple partitions on the same hard drive) without reinstalling applications, I wasted two days and $60 on these two LapLink products. Instructions were confusing, and the migration of the ""moving van"" with all my applications stalled, inexplicably, each time I tried. Got bounced off LapLink on-line chat each time I asked for help. Wound up using Microsoft's free Easy File Transfer to move my data and settings, after which reinstalling the apps was comparatively easy -- the Microsoft utility easily moved my email, calendar info, etc. which was most crucial for me.Great idea, Laplink, but didn't work at all for me."
1,Warning: One Shot Use!,"When I bought this for $29.95 I thought I was getting a deal since it lists at $59. But when I got it I was really irritated. Nowhere in the description does it say that you can only use the software for one transfer, period! When you install it, you burn the serial number and it's all over. So, if you are a computer tech, like me, this is not a reusable tool. Oh, you can certainly BUY another license. But that's absurd in my book. This is like buying a word processor that you can only make one document with. Or a hammer you can only build one project with. Laplink, pull your greedy heads out of your @$$!So, I never used the software. I immediately repackaged it and got an RMA to send it back. You have been warned!"
1,Please don't waste your money,"Bought the product to move all my stuff from a XP computer to a new Vista one. After fooling around for some time I was getting an error message telling me that my operating system was not compatable. I contacted Laplink and they indeed do know that ther software will not work on a Vista computer, so unless you are transfering to an older XP system this software is useless. The line on the box says ""The Easiest Way to Move into a Windows XP or Vista PC!"" That is a lie!!! And of course since I have opened and installed the software it is no longer returnable. So let the waste of my $65.00 keep you from wasting yours!"
1,Absolute disaster,"The ""transfer"" first stalled halfway through. The second time, it finished -- but nothing worked. Not a single app functioned. Then, when I told it to ""undo"" its mess, it left 90% of it behind. Also, settings on my old computer were changed. Buy something else. This thing doesn't do what it promised to do."
1,"""Not As Advertised""","I cannot recommend buying this product. It claims to only move what you select, however it appears to move the registry in entirety and moves programs not selected. Half of the programs moved do not work. Some have required much work to reinstall, including registry editing. It cost $75 to pay Sun to get Java to work on the new computer due to errors caused by PC Mover.I moved my documents files via home network, and used PC Mover to move programs. If a person has the possibility to connect old and new computer to same network, I believe better results would be obtained by moving files manually and reinstalling programs rather than use this product."
1,An obsolete program,"I can't imagine that anyone would buy this program today except to move from an old computer to a new Windows 7 computer--but this program won't do that, unless you buy a special cable in addition to the inadequate cable included in the box. I learned that the hard way, after struggling with PCMover for a day. The manufacturer and amazon.com should not be selling this product as ""new,"" but as an obsolete antique."
3,OK if you are at least a semi-geek,"Bottom line is, I got my files and most settings moved from a Vista computer to a new Windows 7 computer. But it was not a quick, easy or painless process.Problem 1. The included, special ethernet cable would not handshake correctly between the two machines. I went back to an old version of the program that I still had around, and found the USB cable. I then needed to install special drivers onto the new computer to make that cable work. And then, because it was a USB 1.1 cable, the transfer took about 26 hours for about 100 gigs of stuff. That's a LOOONG time, pardner.Problem 2. Three breakdowns/crashes en route. Close program, reselect options, each time. BORING. At least I could start from the most recent crash rather than all over from scratch.So my new computer is running OK after a few manual tweaks. I can recommend PC Mover to people who havea. purchased it cheaplyb. know something about computer TLCc. and possess lots and lots of patience"
2,Not worth the money,"Sounds nice in concept, but customer support was unhelpful and slightly arrogant. In the end it was safer and easier to use the Microsoft free tool and reinstall the apps myself. Again, a great idea, but over priced and the customer service........."
2,Laplink,"This sotware product is pretty poorly designed. You don't get a lot of options on what you can move. Most importantly, it didn't move all of my documents. Some are flat out missing. Very bizarre. The user interface and installation are not poorly organized.Moving settings from one system to another is always a dicey proposition, but I thought this would be a simple way to move documents, favorites, e-mail PST files, etc. It wasn't. I'm now manually moving things. Save your money and just buy an external hard drive."
1,Sort of works but crashed 2 different sytems.,I work on computers and have been a head of a department supporting 50 computers. I decided to try this product for moving stuff over to a clients computer. The first had the desktop constantly restart. No one could use the computer. The next computer would not even start after using the program.I had to format the new hard drives and reinstall the software and use other methods to move the data over. This took extra time. The other methods did not move the program over but were faster and did not crash the system. I am out the money for this product and it was horrific. I won't not suggest this product as all.
4,PCMover,"Almost There!I'm not a techie, but for the money it was worth the investment. It transferred the majority of the information from the two drives in my old notebook. It did not transfer my Outlook inbox/outbox or the archive files (which I had a lot of) this may have been my fault still working on that issue.Because of a problem with my registry PCMover recommended that I purchase another problem to solve the registry problem. I was able to purchase and down load it over the internet successfully.I would use it again."
3,Good Program BEWARE this version has a USB 1.1 cable,"This program seems to work great BUT the cable that came in this package ordered from AMAZON is a USB 1.1 so far the program says it will take over 12 hours to transfer a handful of programs to my new VISTA PC. There are cheaper options right here on AMAZON that also sell this package with this 1.1 cable but for some reason I thought AMAZON had the newer product with the USB 2 cable, NOT SO."
1,Beware of Lap Link Software,"I purchased to product after being told by the company that it would be able to move files and key software. My biggest concern was would software that I use every day such as Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, Outlook, Power Point and Access) actually function if moved by Lap Link. The company assured me of two things - first - it would work; second - if it did not work there was a money back guarantee.My results - it did not work. Every software program that i use on a day to day basis did not function. I requested a refund immediately back in (December 2012). It is February 2013 and I have never received the refund.My suggestion, save your time and don't buy this software UNLESS you only want to transfer files."
1,What a waste of money and time,"This software was a waste of money and time. Microsoft Office did not transfer correctly, nothing really worked right. Still had to reformat the hard drive and start from scratch. And I was going from a windows 8 PC to another windows 8 PC."
1,Wasted days and wasted nights,"Followed directions, engaged PCMover support, using almost two identical computers in Windows 7, turned off all security softwared, turned off power saving, ensured firewalls open, and half the time the sofware would not recognize teh other computer using the cable included in the box. Transfer attended 5 times, and failed every time. Support............ unable to come up with a solution. I've wasted more time with this than it would take me to install new programs and copy files over. Good job PC Mover."
1,Mixed Results for IT shop,"This is just one mans FYI results:PCMover Ultiamete Pro with Ethernet crossover cable did not transfer the Microsoft Office 2007 Suite from one older XP machine to the new XP machine. Even had same user names, and users folder names in the Documents and Settings folder. That is the single biggest reason I wanted to purchase it. Now I still have to call Microsoft.It transferred my Adobe CS4 license, but not my Acrobat Pro license. Odd. Now I still have to call Adobe.I wonder if I will have any better results if I did an XP to Windows 7 Migration. I will advise if so.Thanks."
1,Not worth the time or money!,"Complete waste of time and money! I knew going in that it would likely take 5 or so hours for the file transfer. What I didn't realize is that it doesn't move non MS items like Quick Books at all. It would have been far faster for me to re-install my software programs manually then to use PC Mover. I keep all my files backed-up anyway so PC Mover really didn't help in that area either.PCmover with Selectivity, Including Laplink USB 1.1 Cable"
1,Useless,"this product is only good for moving your data files. You can get better results by using the software that comes with Windows 7 and a cheap cable. This used to be a great product and would let you move your applications. Now you will still need to reinstall your applications and reregister them. Not a time saver, but a time waster."
4,review,"Only after receiving the product, did I hear about any of the caveats. It does NOT copy everything - as you have probably guessed there are some licenses that are not simple or simply applied. Overall, it did about 80% of what I needed and expected."
1,Don't Bother,This software is basically useless. After wasting time I ended up using the easy transfer cable for windows 7 from belkin. It actually works as advertised.
1,Discouraged,"Sadly, the product was used and the registration belonged to the original purchaser. If I was tech savvy enough to realize that, I could have saved paying the seller price plus purchasing a newer product. What a lesson learned!"
1,Many compatibility issues. A complete waste of money!,"I bought this software to save time migrating my files and applications to a new laptop. I am a web developer who relies heavily on the Adobe CS3 Suite of applications. If you've ever installed this suite, then you know that it can take hours. Nowhere on laplink's web site does it say that their software isn't compatible with Adobe's. Yet when I tried to migrate everything over, Adobe wouldn't run at all. It just said that I needed to reinstall everything from scratch. In addition there were incompatibilities that caused other software applications to error. After several hours I ended up giving up on trying to use PCMover and just reinstalled everything manually. What a waste of time and money this software was. I can't get my money back and it's unusable on other machines, once installed.The whole idea behind using PCMover was to save valuable time. It turned out to be the opposite. Don't waste your money!"
1,PCmover,"Using this product was a nightmare. I followed the directions exactly moving from an XP computer to a Vista computer. I ended up having to erase and reformat the hard disk of the Vista machine, and having to resinstall all factory loaded software, then copy over my important files. This was time consuming and the product was a BIG disappointment. A better route is to save all important files and copy them over, forgetting the software. New versions are often needed to run on Vista anyway. I wanted to save time but ended up spending WAY more time using this product."
2,Laplink PC-Mover; Not that great,"I upgraded my business laptop and wanted to transfer all engineering programs from the old to the new. The transfer did indeed work, kind-of. Not all programs came across. The important and most secure ones did not make it. In the end, I found Windows Easy Transfer (free) was equivalent to PC Mover (at least for me). I think I wasted my money on PC Mover"
3,"Competent, but not great","Ms. Kress turns out a competent work of mystery here. The story is good, and we don't find out ""whodunit"" until the very end. My only complaint is that the characters were a bit cliche. Dr. Melanie Anderson was just about the angriest character I have ever seen. In my own humble opinion, I don't see how she could possibly have risen to a position of responsibility within the CDC with some of the know-nothing convictions she holds. Agent Cavanaugh is the quintessential ""man afraid of commitment""Read this book and be entertained for a few hours."
3,Enjoyable Science Fiction Mystery,"This is a competent science fiction/mystery hybrid. The plotting is good and quality of writing solid. Good for a short, undemanding read."
5,thank GOD,"Being a Old Head =41 I came up on rap so I dont listen to today rap or should I say crap,no message no meaning,lack of lyrical creativity.This cd is what rap should be about a message and meaning.5 star keep up the good work!!!"
3,Made it through chapter 5,"I really wanted to like this book. Has some thought provoking stuff. I could almost overlook that he's an atheist. I thought, well, I'll see what he says. Well, the author put too much politics for me to continue. He is critical of President Bush in fighting ""evil"", but has nothing to say towards the anti-war left or the liberals who only see evil when it politically suits them and even then it is about power. (IMO)To inject one side of the political without the other, without the looking into how one side can clearly define evil and the other looks for political points; well, I found it hard to read much more. I read into the next chapter, chapter 5, but couldn't any more read this guys ramblings.Not a book I can recommend to a conservative mindset. I was really looking forward to this book and am really let down by the author."
2,Blah,"Oh the joys of institutionalized, modern philosophy. Sometimes it is enlightening and insightful. Often it is dull, long-winded, oppressive, political, depressing, and argumentative, much like the modern philosophers and the college philosophy professors who push this stuff."
1,Poor Quality Paper and Print,"It's hard to read because the pages are of a poor quality off-white paper, and the print is small and not dark. I happened to buy the CD months later, and the content is good."
5,"Postmodernists, Meet the Ancients again, yet perhaps for the first time!","This is remarkable piece of scholarship in which the threads of philosophy, psychology, theology, and cultural anthropology are woven together with wit, intelligence, practical and personal reference points. Professor Haidt will, no doubt, hate me for saying this, but I found this to be a most powerful tools for my own self development, reflection, and life planning. This is also the most cogent, actionable, and complete explanation of the Positive Psychology world I have come across. It is as if the author took dozens of pieces of very dense research and connects the dots among them in a profound and approachable way."
4,"I'm ""Happy"" I bought this book.",The book presents old wisdom and pairs it with modern scientific research which is interesting and an unusual approach. The author gives ten main points on how happiness is achieved by different people. He shares his knowlege and lets the reader make up his own mind. He is well read and uses examples from all kinds of literature. The book has been a worthwhile read for me.
5,Great Read!,I would recommend this book to anyone looking to get some understanding of how and why they think and act the way they do.
2,Save your money,"This is a collection of often old studies that the author has collected (I learned about the Harlow monkey experiments in college 30 yaers ago). His earth shattering conclusions include that we should strike a middle way between spirituality and materialism, and that often after people have bought something that they always wanted they are dissappointed. At the climax of the book he states that in order to be happy we need loving meaningful relationships and a job that provides us with satisfaction. What a shocka!!!!How we establish such relationships and find such jobs is our problem.In short a collection of simplistic drivel. However I give it 2 stars instead of one because it flows along nicely."
5,Absolutely fascinating book!,"I love this book, it's very interesting and fascinating! Every other sentence I'm nodding ""wow, yeah that's true, I didn't see it that way!"". This book offers a great insight into people's minds and hearts, and explains what the true drivers of happiness are. The elephant and the rider analogy completely makes sense. This book has made a difference in my life, I now look at things from a different viewpoint. The author's knowledge of biology, human anatomy, philosophy, psychology, sociology is very impressive. He explains human behavior using scientific studies and theories but also gives his own personal opinion and ideas which makes the book more personable and reader-friendly and not just a stiff textbook. An overall excellent book!"
5,One of the best books I have read,This is by far one of the best book I have read on the subject. The author is backing up every idea with the latest research. Worth the time!
5,wisdom literature made easy,"haidt's book is the best summary of the recent findings in the war betweeen sociobiologists,positive thinkers and existentialists.dont nmiss it"
4,Stunning,"Accessible, helpful and thought provoking. Great read and good introduction to positive psychology. Go read some SeligmanLearned Optimism: How to Change Your Mind and Your Lifenow that you have been introduced to the concepts."
5,The Best,I have no reservation: This is the best book I have every read.I was astonished at the number of subjects from every life that came up. I was astonished at some of the results from experimental psychology.Haidt weaves all this together in a logical and readable way.I am also impressed by his graciousness in expressing his admiration for the work of others.I have ordered 5 copies to give as Christmas presents.
4,Happiness Hypothesis,I do like the book and how it is written. Many of the ideas and thoughts are written in a way that one can comprehend.I found the first part of the book a little difficult but the rest of it flowed quite well.
4,Pursuit of happines,"What is it that makes people happy? How can one attain happiness and find meaningful life? Can happiness be permanent, or is it collection of moments? All these questions and many more were on my mind when I decided to read this book. I found book exciting because on the cover it mentiond how ancient philosophy defines what is it that makes humans happy. Author dips into all thoughts, both ancient and modern: Greek, Hindu, Buddism to name a few. I was glad to learn that we are all product of what we inherit and experience we collect throughout our lives. We need to first learn about ourselves -- who we are, why we are the way we are and what stirs our emotions in a positive way. The approach to achieving happiness is different for all of us individually: altruism, philantrophy, random acts of kindness, meditation... The trick is finding out balance in life and being consistant with it. Now, we are talking true happiness."
3,"Insightful, but challenging","This book was recommended to me as a source for insight following a rather unpleasant life event. The book is interesting and well-written, but it is clinical in its tone although softened by using layman terminology. I have found it a very difficult book to read in parts. It requires some concentration and the time to read extensively so that the concepts which reinforce each other sink in. It is not anecdotal as much as reasoned in its approach to human interaction and the underlying scientific studies documenting the mechanics of relationships.I like the book, but it's been tough to sit down and make a large dent in it. And I don't know that the clinical analysis of ""why things happen between people"" is as much what i was looking for as ""how life can improve.""In fairness, I'm only 1/2 way through. I will finish and update the review."
4,I listened to Unabridged Audio CD Version--Interesting & Well Done,"Except for his under-informed take on Buddhism [he misunderstands the subtlety of what the Buddha means by dissatisfaction/suffering], The Happiness Hypothesis is an interesting and skillful blend of ancient wisdom and scientific studies on happiness. Some of it will be familiar to those of us who've read a lot in this area, but odds are high there will be plenty you won't be familiar with and enough of a different perspective to hold your interest. Enjoy!As noted, I listened to the unabridged CD version, it was clear and easy to follow.-Marshall GlickmanAuthor, Beyond the Breath: Extraordinary Mindfulness Through Whole-Body Vipassana Meditation"
3,Flimsy.,"The price should have told me. The knives blades are thin enough to be a boning knive. Too flexible making it differcult to work with. They are sharp. The blade is not sturdy, as I said before like a boning knive. They could be dangerous since they are sharp, but flimsy. Use with care. Delivery wasn't up to Amazon standards."
1,Feng Shui Didn't work for me,Part of why it was used and the product did not come complete. I was not happy with this product or service.
4,Little Less Pressure,"I noticed that this does not have as much pressure as the regular shower and I end up having to rinse my hair a bit longer. I have well water and switched to this as well as once a week Murad so I can't tell which exactly helped me to stop loosing hair. Either way, I bought this because of the reviews on helping with this exact problem, and the combination stopped the hair loss. So Yes, BUY THIS if you are loosing too much hair and have well water. Should also consider the murad bran shampoo/conditioner/scalp treatment and some B vitamins. I am cured!!! :)"
5,awesome product,This filter does what it says. I have a well and could not keep my hair blonde....until now. I will never be without
2,Not quite as good as I expected,"I bought this after reading the excellent reviews, and I must say I was a little disappointed. My skin and hair are not nearly as soft as when I shower at my parents, with there water softener. I don't know if the town I live in has crazy awful water or what, but I didn't notice a big difference. I would not buy again."
1,Jonathan Product Beauty Water Shower Purification,Awful! It leaked and had the improper washer to prevent it from doing so. A plumber said it wasn't worth trying to adapt it for the shower plumbing.
1,Short Changed,I only received a filter and not a complete system. I was not able to use this item. I ordered the full system from ANGELAS BEAUTY for 55.00 thru Amazon.
3,tricky installation,"I have replaced the filter in this system a few times before with no problem. This time, it leaked like crazy until we realized that the O ring on the shower head had come off with the old filter.....had to get the old filter out of the trash and remove the O ring from it which was tricky to get back in the right place on the shower head and make it stay. After that, it was fine, but I'm wondering if you have to buy the whole unit again to avoid this problem."
4,Takes a few weeks to see results. :),"I bought this filter in hopes that it would help with my hair (which is colored, thick and below shoulder length) and it didn't disappoint. I did start using Alterna moisturizing shampoo and conditioner at the same time, and it took a few weeks to see positive changes in my hair and skin BUT.. with that said, I'm so thrilled with the condition of my hair now. I don't use de-frizzing products or shine enhancing products and my hair looks glossy and smooth about 90% of the time. Well worth the cost of the shower unit!"
5,A GODSEND!,"I have heard wonderful things about this product- and they are all true!I use city water as I live in an apartment, and I'm sure it works just as great for well water as well.I suffer from adult acne, eczema, dry skin all around and dry hair- this thing does wonders for all of the above!In just my first use my skin didn't feel dry after getting out of the shower, my acne hasn't itched nearly as much, and it didn't bother eczema at all!It's so easy to install, the shower head itself works better than my original one and I even use it for baths and to wash my face in the mornings and nights."
3,I mean...is it actually doing anything?,"I am not sure this thing is working. The 3-star rating is really just saying that the shower head gives adequate water pressure and installed easily. I can't tell a difference in the water coming from the system -- seems like the water from before. My hair doesn't feel any different and my skin is basically the same. But, I know sometimes it takes a while to see results, so I am on week 3 and will re-evaluate in a month or so to see if this thing is actually living up to what it promised."
3,"Works good, but not sure about the benefits",I personally didn't notice any difference in water quality. It doesn't make water feel slimy like a water softener would. My hair and skin seem to be the same after several weeks of use. Still thinking about a new water softener (old one broke 2 years ago and we didn't buy a new one since).
5,Jonathan 'Beauty Water' refill cartridge,"I have well water. My softener and Iron Filter are inadequate. My hair used to be frizzy and I would have to continually get hard water treatments at my salon. Since 2010, when I began using the Jonathan beauty water filter system in my shower, my hair is soft, not frizzy, and even my skin feels soft, not itchy or tight. I love this system and will always buy the refills when my cartridge wears out. It's an amazing product!"
5,A Piece of Fame,"I may be biased on saying this book is the greatest book ever written (next to the Bible), partly because I pesonally know the author, and one of the main characters he used,""Serge"", is actually my older brother, real nickname ""Sarge"", also, my entire family is mentioned on page 7, (I'm Tony). Anyway, the places mentioned in the book are real existing places in my hometown, and life at that time couldn't be more accurate. This book keeps you on the edge of your seat, and it is fun to read, but you may want to keep it away from younger children as it contains bad language, it is mainly for adult readers, but overall an excellent book"
3,Intuition: It's Powers and Perils,"Book was in ""fair"" condition - Obviously had been read by someone else. There underlining was evident along some stains on the book pages. Arrival was just okay as I had ordered it just to read rather than having to read it for a deadline."
2,One has to wonder....,"One has to wonder just how much ""intuition"" this author has... There is more to intuition than rationality and ""intuition"" as a word has become like the word ""love"". A lot of people use it, but how many really understand it?In my opinion... a simple example... Gambling is not based on true intuition, indeed is a gross misuse and ""understanding"" of the true ability of intuition. A ""wishful thinking"" scenario if I may. A ""gee I wish I could do that"" kind of thing. There are just some things some people cannot do. Or cannot do well. That's what makes us all important.Careful of an analytical author debunking intuitiveness.... a cat cannot understand fully what it is like to be a dog.... the same holds with people who write analytically about a subject that is not analytical in true form."
4,"Very double bass focused, good nonetheless","Just a warning - If you don't have a double bass, you might feel a bit ripped off. When I saw Thomas in clinic I instantly got this DVD, watched it and felt it was kinda useless boring, and his voice ticked me off. Then, months later I sat down, determined to learn some stuff off it. Whoa... I am so glad. Movement and Mechanics is great for solos, and Stick Tricks, is also amazingly beneficial for jazzing up your solos. I felt a bit left out with all the double bass stuff in there (I remain defiant not getting a double bass), but still there were about 4 chapters that had nothing double bassish in it. The DVD is great in a sense that it is all transcribed in PDF form, but you need a DVD on your computer to view it. To epitomize, if you've got a double bass you will love this DVD, if you don't, you'll still like it, but you won't gain as much from it."
1,Give credit where credit is due!,Great production and playing but I can't help but think that Thomas bascically presented ALL of Marco Minnemann's ideas from his book Extreme Interdependence.
1,"Musical drummers, beware of this DVD",Do not buy it if you want to learn about being a musical drummer. No groove what so ever. Very basic lessons for independence. Not worth the $$$.
5,Yeah Baby!,"This dvd(s) is off the hook!Man, don't listen to the guy who rated it one star,HE IS A MAJOR BONEHEAD!Anyway, this dvd has alot of tight lessons that will keep you hooked for decades to come!"
2,Better designs available,"This gets the job done but there's better designs available.The tank is angled the top which means it won't sit flat in the sink when you're trying to fill it up. The fill hole is only slightly larger than what you'd find on a soda bottle, so you can't fill it up quickly in the tub. The small opening also means it doesn't dry out quickly.For reasons beyond all understanding, they put in a very bright light you can't turn off. If you want to use it in a bedroom, you might have a hard time sleeping with it on.It's pretty quiet but definitely louder than other ultrasonic vaporizers I've used.Overall I would look at one of the Vicks units instead."
3,It is goof for office use but not for bedroom.,The water goggles and it bothers me when I try to fall asleep. Otherwise it is quiet. There was another review on it says this too. Now that reivew is gone. Wondering why.
1,honewell humidifier unreliable,"I purchased this humidifier and within 2 weeks the motor became so weak it didn't blow out any moisture. Worst humidifier I have ever had and I use one every winter. And it is not ""quiet"" as it says in its name. It may not blow as loudly, but the constant gurgling of the water is worse!"
1,Piece of junk Stopped working after one day!,"Worked fine for a day, then, trouble started. No mist coming out on highest setting, then, it started leaking on my carpet. Did everything mentioned in trouble shooting the device and nothing worked. The warranty is a joke. I have to send to them at my own cost with a $10 check or money order for ""processing fee."" So, basically, I'll end up paying $20+ just for them to see what the problem is and whether they'll give me a replacement or not and possibly pay for shipping it back. I just bought another one (different brand) and thrown this one in the garbage where it belongs."
1,Revised Review - Have two of them both leak after less than one year,Loved these humidifiers at first but simply don't hold up. Both of them leak all over after less than one year. Do not recommend.
1,very bad quality,"bought 3 in 3 years, all stopped working after a few months, will go to other brands."
2,Great while it works.,"I've had this unit about 3 years & it leaks where the 2 pieces go together.I always dry it before I put the top on. I have used distilled water because of the white dust filters don't last & are expensive. I would never buy another Honeywell Ultra QuietCare(tm) Cool Mist Humidifier, White Finish."
3,Ok but could be better,"Annoyingly the humidifier tank leaks when you refill it, plus it's too small. In addition, even with the recommended maintenance and replacing filters more often than recommended, mineral deposits collect. So I use PURE distilled vinegar, which works but which is much stronger than Honeywell suggests. Hopefully this concentration of vinegar won't harm the humidifier. However, I'm using that because I already know that the alternative, namely persistent mineral deposits, can destroy a humidifier, as I found out withHoneywell HWM450 Quick Steam Warm Moisture Humidifier. For my latest humidifier, which I just ordered, I'm trying Crane Crane Tear Drop Humidifier; hoping for better."
2,It runs great for 3 months then not so much,Like others I found that it runs great for a while. Eventually about 2 weeks in I had troubles with it producing mist. I tilted it back and found that worked great for about 3 months. I used the optional filter cartriges and cleaned it every 3 days but it eventually stopped producing mist. I can't get it to work anymore. I wouldn't buy another KAZ/HONEYWELL product except for perhaps the large cool air units.
1,Doesn't last very long,"Purchased two of these 2 yrs ago, one died at end of last winter, started making loud clicking sound, then just quit making mist.The second one just started making the same noise, should die any day now.Not worth the price, can't turn the light off(electrical tape fixed mine) and it's a hassle to fill."
2,Very uncomfortable,"I owned this Humidifier for 3 years and have to concur with others that the design of the tank is very uncomfortable. I have to hold the tank upside down and fill it in with jug of water. By now the drops of water start coming out of the bottom.Overall its quiet, but the design to fill the tank and light is very uncomfrotable. Also I think its dead now cause its not producing any steam whatsoever. I tried to play with the tank if I sat it wrong but after adjusting for 2 days its still not producing any steam. Did not even work full 3 years.So I am on amazon looking for the better humidifier."
3,Humidifier,"Excellent product but needs attenion. Must keep deposits removed or does not work. Must empty after each use!!! Very, very Quiet."
2,low steam,"worked well first couple of weeks,then would release adequate steam for app.20 min.and then diminish.tried to clean filter,good for a couple of hours then returned to same problem.I did like the quietness of the machine,also requires little care."
1,Leaks Water!!! Piece of junk!,"I'm now on my second humidifier. I returned the first one because it leaked water. I called the company and they said to exchange at the store. It worked fine for about two weeks, then it started leaking again. It's on a level surface, I followed all the guidelines on how to clean/ fill it. this thing is garbage."
1,Unit Stopped Working,I have to say I am very disappointed in this unit. I purchased it approximately one year ago and it has now stopped emitting a vapor. I have tried all solutions suggested by the owners manual and Honeywell and nothing has fixed it. It's a kind of expensive humidifier to just have to junk after only one year.Does anyone know if you can purchase a new nebulizer unit for the humidifier?
4,Quiet; fun shape,"I just ordered a second HUT after searching unsuccessfully for one in local stores. I really appreciate that it is quiet (many other humidifiers actually hurt my ears) and I like the fun shape, which I find more arty than than the typical clunky/ugly/utilitarian unit. Size is just right and I LIKE the blue light, which I find unobtrusive; it shows if machine is on or needs to be filled--and prevents me from tripping over the humidifier if I leave it on the floor, at night. White film is a bit of a bother, but other humidifiers do this, too; tilted top does make it a little awkward to fill as you need to hold it while filling, rather than rest it on sink or tub bottom."
2,Leaks horribly!,"We ended up buying 6 of these taking back each one as they all leaked! Not just a tiny bit either! The last 2 we kept, I took silicone calking and sealed around the edges of where the clear front meets the white plastic. That is where it was leaking.This unit is VERY quiet and does work well, once it stops leaking. The tiny knob to get it unscrewed was tough to take off after it suctioned on.We had these for 2 years then had to throw them out. Not worth the money. If they could figure out how to make the leaking issue better, and the knob not so difficult to remove, they'd have a great product!"
2,Big Problem - It Leaks,"This looked to be the ideal solution to low humidity - easy to fill, narrow but tall, etc. But after a few months, first one then the second unit we owned began to leak. Needless to say it was a mess, and destroyed the finish on a dresser. Do not risk it."
2,does not work,"I was under the impression this was a fancy pedal to be used in a box car racer but I have gone through three in one day and they all broke. There is no place to screw it into the brace and it breaks like glass, then there is this silver disc inside and it does not seem to have any function whatsoever after the glass around it breaks. I am getting my money back along witht that green blood you know that type 0 negative blood that is green well there is not a drop it also has a silver thing in it and I do not understand why it is there."
5,Wonderful -- Just Wonderful,"I LOVE whodunits. I have solved thousands of whodunit puzzles over the years in multiple languages. I consider myself to be a tough critic.However, this new book by Hy Conrad way exceeded my expectation. All the stories were unique, original, and written beautifully. The book first provides the mystery, followed by additional clues, followed by one or two definitive clues, and then the correct answer. I enjoyed the process of going through all of them in sequence while thinking long and hard. Even for a seasoned veteran like me, some puzzles were quite tough -- tough enough that I had to look at the definitive clues.I recommend this book not only to older children (who enjoy mystery puzzles) but also to non-English speakers, who wish to improve their English skills while having some fun."
1,Don't buy these from Amazon because the cookies will be stale/soft.,"I also got two packs of 24 using the buy one get one free deal. Despite the fact that the cookies are sealed in each individual box, the cookies are soft. I've had Barnum's Animal Crackers countless times in my life, and I have never had soft cookies.Now I'm stuck with over 40 small boxes of soft animal crackers. Amazon says that this item isn't eligible for return. I'm not giving the animal crackers a poor rating; I'm giving Amazon's animal crackers a poor rating.Don't buy these from Amazon!!"
1,At Least the Box is Still Nice,"Barnum Animal Crackers are no longer the crisp, delicious cookies with beautiful animal forms that they once were. The new cookies are soft and pasty and feature cheap, vague animal forms. The only positive note is that at least the box is still attractive."
1,Sat in sun to long,"Terrible, terrible. bought two boxes with 24 in each box. One of the 24 packs was stale."
5,31 cents a box,"For $30.00 shipped for 48 boxes it was a good deal. They are good snacks for the little ones. when they visit. Also gave a case to my sister in law for her little one.First time I bought any type of food from amazon, wasn't to sure if the product would be fresh, but it was."
3,Good cookies but misrepresented,"I purchased these cookies because my boyfriend and I both like them, but grew tired of buying the little circus boxes at almost twice the price. So we refill our boxes from these larger packs. The only problem is these Snack Pak cookies are NOT the same as the circus box cookies. They are a different size and they taste different. This should be clearly stated by the manufacturer or the seller[...]"
1,Completely overpriced,Don't buy these at $37 for 24 boxes! You can get them cheaper at the supermarket! How can they call this a sale price- it's misleading.
3,"Love the crackers, but they don't ship well","I really love Barnum's Animal Crackers and was tired of spending $2/box for some when I was traveling so I thought to buy a case. These are the real thing and taste great. Price is good. packaging is good. The only problem I have with it is that they were shipped in their original carton by Amazon and UPS wasn't all that nice to the box, so a good portion of the crackers were cracked (though still edible, just messy).I'll stick to buying them in a local store where I can feel for crackedness before I buy."
4,Barnum's Animal Crackers. A Nice Treat For My little Boy.,"Mmmmmm. animal crackers. I remember liking them as a kid. Barnum's, it's even the same brand. I found these at my nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market and the box was labeled ""Limited Edition."" These ""Limited Edition"" boxes constituted only about 10% of the total boxes. It was predominantly blue and featured a mother polar bear and cub, the same illustration as appears in the upper right-hand corner of the drawing on this box. Hmmmm. Special edition? I wondered what was so special. Evidently it was only the box. Inside was the same assortment of cookies I would expect in any Barnum's Animals box. Taste the same too. Ah well. These will be a nice treat for my little boy.Gary Peterson"
1,The royal family through rose-colored glasses,"The problems with this book begin with its title: It's neither a social history, nor does it have much detail about Buckingham Palace. Instead, Edna Healey has written a sugar-coated history of the royal family. Some of her sources are linked to the royal family, and the resulting book is so unabashedly fawning that all credibility is lost. Even Edward VIII is described in a sympathetic light. Those with a serious interest in the history of Buckingham Palace as a physical structure will be disappointed in the amount of detail, and there are other authors who have written more balanced treatments of the royal family."
1,Very poor,"Instructor is inarticulate/incoherent. Sound and video quality is poor. Camera angles are such that you typically can't even see what he is playing. The only enjoyment to be had is the mental challenge of trying to remember what tune the ""riffs"" are from, since he never mentions the actual song titles."
1,"Beware of all ""In The Style of..."" Videos","I completely agree with the first reviewer. All that I want to add is that I've tried a few of these ""In The Style of..."" videos, and all of them have been horrible. So this one isn't the only bad apple."
1,Terrible,This tape consists of a guy hurrying through several well known licks. If there's any instruction here I don't see it. Worthless.
1,what is the lesson?,This DVD is the worst. It only provides you some information and the guy just played the tune twice (one at normal speed and one at a slower speed) and then you on your on.Don't buy it.
4,"Beatles Guitar Instructional dvd ""In the style of""","Well I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer. I am a professional guitarist (but a slow learner) and I have several ""In the style of"" dvd's. Curt Mitchell is a great guy! No, I don't know him personally, but he comes across as very genuine and he's just being himself. I admire him for that. He's not trying to act or perform, he's teaching us riffs. And I love his commentaries and opinions on guitarists and bands, in fact I would love for them to be longer and more in depth! I would have rated this dvd 5 stars if it were longer. Curt Mitchell jams!!"
4,Rather Timely,"Although written when people knew what a slide rule was, the basic story -- that of private enterprise being contrasted to government programs is as telling today as when it was written. The pitfalls of any design project constained by an in-place bureacuracy are in sharp contrast to the demands and flexibility of private enterprise. Shute's experience is as important to today's readers as when the airships were being deceloped.It should be required reading for engineering students, no matter what their areas of specialization."
3,not about how to use a slide rule,"What i was looking for was a book that would show me how to use a slide rule to take a trig class, since the teachers do not allow the use of calculator to do the calculations. this is not it."
1,Not What I Expected,"I purchased this phone after owning another Samsung phone for 3 years prior with no problems. However, the VGA 1000 I purchased just 8 months ago broke on the hinge when closing the phone and is now in two pieces. After contacting Samsung, I was told this is considered ""physical damage"" and not a defect, at which point they implied that I had abused the phone and would charge me $75 to try to repair it. Sprint, with whom I have my service, also called me a liar and insisted that the phone could not have broken on the hinge simply by closing it. I beg to differ. Neither company will do anything to help me. I am disappointed as I considered Samsung a reputable product and had even paid more money to get a Samsung phone than had I gone with another brand."
2,The king of dropped calls!,"I had this phone about 3 frustrating weeks then I exchanged it for a Sanyo, it dropped nearly EVERY call. I have had sprint since they were introduced, I had more dropped calls in the three weeks of using this phone then I have the entire time I have had the sprint service. The signal strength was very good nearly every time, still dropped the calls. Also the phone would make beeping sounds in the ear peice the entire time you were talking on it... and one more thing, after a short while the of use the phones battery would get very hot. Samsung needs to go back to school on this one!What I did like... The color screen was incredible and the ease of use was great, if it wasn't for the problems I would have gave a very high rating of this phone. It has some nice features.One final thought... Its too bad Motorola doesn't have any sprint phones anymore nothing compares to the quality and durability of a Motorola."
1,Sprint... Bad Service,Buyer beware... do not buy Sprint. I give them zero stars! I purchased a Treo 600 for metro Atlanta. Basically the service was very bad. I called to cancelled and charged me $112 and change. As a business customer or any customer why am I being changed for poor service. I am not going to speak bad about their customer service because they tried. But they do not understand about business relationships and how to assist the customer. If you intend to buy a phone from them get the least expensive plan first. Then will not loose as much monsy as I did for just 7 days of service.
2,Downloaded Pictures,The pictures look okay BUT they are alot smaller than the pictures that my brother gets from ihis LG phone
2,"It's good, but Eamon hates Sprint!!!","DISPLAY: It's ok. I've seen better.CAMERA: AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!VOICE DIALING: Never use it.INTERNET: SLOW!!! Dial-up is faster!PHONE BOOK: Cool.Get this phone if yuor a ghetto flag. Most common flags own one of these, because Eamon and Akon hate Sprint. But Ashlee Simpson has Sprint so I guess it's ok."
2,You love to roam? You will with this phone.,I have had this phone for almost 2 years. I am not very impressed. The coverage for the phone is horrible. The phone switches from analog and digital roam constantly. If I wanted to pay too much for service this would be the phone to use.
1,"If you don't mind low batteries and no signal, this is the phone for you!",This phone is horrible! The battery might last a day. I've been to several major cities in the US and haven't been able to find a signal! Good luck if you just purchased this phone!
3,"NIce looking, not that great","I have owned this phone since it came out (1.5 years) and it has done OK for. My biggest complaint is that no one can hear me on it. People are constantly complaining that I cut out when I am talking. The camera sucks too, not even really worth having. The phone looks nice, gets pretty good reception, I like the applications that it comes with. The battery life is average compared to the other phones that I have had. Overall I would not probably recomend this phone unless you just want a decent phone for cheap."
4,Like not love this phone,I like this little phone. Yes the quality of the pictures is poor and it is difficult to see in the daylight. You can download free ringers and games at www.myhonefiles.com. Once I personalized the phone using this site I was much happier.
3,It's okay,Cons: The battery life [is poor] on this phone. It lasts about 2 days if I don't use it. I compared the pictures taken from my phone and my friend's Sanyo SCP5300 and it doesn't compare to it. Sometimes the phone will freeze and I can't turn it off. Instead I have to take off the battery to restart it.Pros: The phone is fun to take funny pictures of friends with the fun frames. The reception is great on this phone. I haven't had a dropped call yet.
2,Sound Quality is Awful,"I bought this phone for the features, and while they are very good, the actual phone on the Samsung VGA1000 is awful. The sound quality is terrible. The camera is nice, but you can find cameras as good or better on other phones. Keep away. This is a dud phone. Samsung should know better."
5,Great phone,"I got this phone a few days ago and am loving it. It's got an excellent menu and navigation which are very important to me. The phone book is great because it enables you to have home, mobile, email, pager, other, a ringer, the person's birthday and a picture. Although I don't plan to use the camera very much it's great- its got a zoom feature and edit feature so you can take a better picture than with most. It's a little slow to power up, but I guess that's because of all the features and the Sprint web service is backed up, so despite a call to customer service and a few days I still don't have access. But the service is much improved from a few years ago, the cust. service rep actually called me back later that afternoon and will do a follow up call tomorrow. So I can't complain too much"
5,Great Phone with a big screen.,First of all I would like to say that this phone is awsome. It has a larger screen than almost any other phone in the same price range. These new TFT screens are very clear(great for games). The camara is also very cool. The web brower works better than you might think a web browser would work on a phone. All in all a great phone.
4,(...) get your facts straight!!!,"""Battery Life mediocre, and Downloading Games expensive and only lasts a few months-what a scam""?????what are you talking about? I have this phone and the battery life is great, allot better than the samsung a-460. It lasts a couple of days give or take a few hours depending on how much you talk, use the browser, or your phone is searching for a signal. Try setting your phone to automode instead of just the sprint network, that way you will save some power. also you dont buy ringers and then only get to keep them for a month or so, if you buy a ringer, then it yours for good."
4,Good phone with a couple minor negatives,"I just got my VGA1000 a couple of weeks ago, and I love it. I play with it constantly. I'm always taking pictures and uploading them to the internet where you make a photo album with captions and all, its really fun. The camera takes good pictures in high quality mode. Wireless web is fast and simple. The screen is big, bright, and clear. It will be a while before get rid of this phone. A few minor gripes include the battery, it gets really hot if you use the phone for more than about 30 min. The flash on the camera tends to just screw up the picture instead of helping it out. Also, the camera is very sensitive, you must hold the phone completely still for the clearest picture. These are only minor complaints though, the good far outweighs the bad. There is currently a good deal on this phone too, so if you're in the market don't pass this phone up."
2,"Great features, bad phone","I replaced my old motorola phone (which lasted the streets of NYC for 2.5 years) with this one because Sprint no longer carries Motorola. I love all the features; web, camera, IM, text messaging, look & design. However, as a phone, it stinks. It can hold the signal, but the sound quality is horrible. People are always telling me that I sound muffled, which was not the case with my old phone. I have to talk very loudly to have heard at a normal level. Plus, it shorts out quite often causing the phone to power down unexpectedly. Very annoying if you are expecting calls. I am not a tough customer and expect these phones to be disposable - especially with the heavy duty use I give it. However, after having high satisfaction with my motorola, I will go back to them. As read, I am not the only one having problems with this phone and quite a few of my friends do not like their Samsung phones. I would stay away if you can."
4,I love the Samsung vga1000,"I just got the phone for a christmas present. So I have had it for almost a week I love it. Nice sharp pictures, nice features, and very easy to do anything. The only problem I have is when I send short messages (text) most of the time it doesn't go through, meaning I have to type it all over again and hope the next time is different. But that should just be my reception problem I don't know about anyone els."
4,Samsung VGA1000,"Well, I've owned this phone since April 2004. It is now August 2004 and I am still amazed at the features it has!!! I was reading a previous article, and they said it cost $15 just to send pictures. Well, this $15 isn't JUST for pictures. You can get a plan for $15 which includes unlimited web access, send unlimited pictures, and send 100 SMS Text Messages! And dude, a data cable isn't $80........ SURF THE WEB! I got mine for $0.10, yes 10 CENTS! Anyways, this is a great phone and I LOVE IT! Its packed with cool features!"
3,Good phone with ok service.,"Let me first say that this is a good phone. It has web service, a camera, games, and other good features. I bought a phone with Sprint. I'm kinda glad I did There service is was ok because I've had a few problems with Sprint. A lot better than my friend's Alltel phone. Here is the good and the bad.Pros & ConsPROS- A phone book that lets you have speed dial up to 300.- Instant messaging that works good.- A fast web service.- High quality camera.CONS- The web only has a few websites, but still very useful at times.- Ringer tone downloads are low quality and sound cheesy with such a good phone.- Games are sometimes expensive.- Sprint isn't the best service out there. Verizon Wireless and T Mobile are better.I somewhat recommend this phone."
4,good phone bad provider,the phone is awsome best reception ive ever had camera is great easy to navigateSprint PCS is a horrible provider you have to pay for everything even storing the picture that you take on you OWN phone 15 extra a month you should be able to upload the pictures to your comp with out having to pay for it. i dont see kodak and hp and other makers of digital cameras charging you to upload your pictures to your computer sprint is horrible
1,Very disappointed,"I ordered this phone for myself and one for my girlfriend because of the free rebate from Amazon. After having it a day we both noticed these beeps while we would talk. After going to Sprint they tested both and said they were defective and gave each of us a new phone. We again had the same problem with these. This chirping sound that can last for 10seconds at a time. Regardless of the phone being free, for $260 there is no reason to have this problem. I called Samsung to see if there is something I can do and the 2 people i spoke to were not friendly and said a 3rd person will call me back within 3 days and it has been over a week with no contact.The camera on the phone is terrific, the phone is easy to use and learn. The outside of the phone is one of the better looking phones on the market, but none of this is worth not being able to talk normally."
2,"be careful... this phone looks cool, but doesn't work well","this is not a great phone at all. i bought it in november and had to return it in january because it kept turning off by itself and it would not want to restart. it's fairly slow and there are often errors when using pcs vision.it doesn't stop there. my mom got the same phone in december and THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO HERS! one day it just stopped working. wouldn't turn on.my coworker had the SAME THING HAPPEN TO HIM!!! he took his phone back, too.we are not crazy, violent people who throw our phones at brick walls! this phone looks really nice, but it's NOT a great phone. i strongly recommend buying a non-camera phone, as those tend to have less problems.if you buy it--good luck!"
2,going back,"Though the sweater fit okay, the material was so thin I could see through it on the backside. Looked very cheap. It is not a twinset, only one layer in back, which would be fine if the material was of better quality. Sending it back. Might have been okay if it would have been a darker color, but I ordered the cream color."
3,Item was returned,"I expected this to be a two piece set, however, it was one piece that appears to be two. I returned since it wasn't what I wanted."
5,super debut legal thriller,"Narayan of Rebeccasreads highly recommends DEATH ROW DEFENDER as an impressive legal thriller & a must-read for the student of criminal law.Jon Clayton's in the slammer accused of a rape-murder. He's a man you love to hate, with a brutal record of violence & crime. No one doubts his guilt, & with elections rolling around, the Governor of Florida decides this is the juicy case to project his stand against crime.Woody Thomas, a world-weary retired public defender, has a hard time convincing himself of his client's innocence... until dangerous things begin to happen to him & he realizes Federal agents are trailing him.What follows is right up there with the best lawyer/author writers & culminates in a ""fantabulous finish."""
4,One of the best litter mats I've tried,"This mat does a pretty good job of catching the litter. It is rubber, so it is flexible and easy to keep in place. As with all of the litter mats I have tried, our 2 cats try to avoid walking on it but they don't mind this one as much as others I have tried. Just need to be clever in placing the box and mats in such a way that they have to walk on them. I do think more than one mat is necessary to catch the litter."
3,Great scenery,"Very beautiful scenery in this video. Definitely inspired me to check out the Goat Rocks Wilderness. Only beef I have is the video quality isn't that good, and the narrators voice can be quite annoying."
3,"not bad, but...","The book gives pretty good Jini overview, but it's just that: overview. Don't expect any code examples. Also there is a lot of repetition where the author goes over the same points in different chapters."
3,Not so good,"Quite hard to follow. The organization is pretty weird and jumps all over the place. Diagram that are being refered to and are usually on the next page, so you end up fliping back and forth. Formulars are organized pretty badly. End of chapter has a summary which give the important parts, so that's a plus."
1,7 days Norway,"I was watching this movie together with friends. We all were a little disappointed about the film. I am not sure of the purpose of this movie, but if it is to make travelers wanting to go visit Norway, it is a failure.Most of the movie was filmed in sad weather condition.It looks like the weather in Norway is grey, windy, wet and cold, even in the middle of the summer.I guess he photographer had a tight schedule and could not wait for the weather to improve.The part from Lofoten was nice though.I missed a reportage from the nice southern part of Norway also.All in all a cheap and sad movie. I will not recommend anyone to buy it."
2,not the best of bing !,I was somewhat disappointed at this bing offering because I felt they left out a ton of rare bing material !These were some just ho-hum performances. The bing rare 2 cd offering is a definite no buy folksI doubt I'll ever listen to that cd ever again
3,Total Lack of Communication,This seller is not very good with communicating with when there is a problem with an order. However the seller did issue me a refund which is why I gave three stars instead of the one star.
4,A Humorous Treat,"Jigg's Drug Store is full of cats, and has a leaky roof. The people who reside in the town of APplesap think that Jigg's dancing cats are under a spell and when the drug dtore threatens to close down they couldn't be happier. That is, all except for Melba who must decide weather to face her fears and fight for her store or if she should leave it alone and loose her sanctuary.What a colorful story! I was thrilled by this story the first time I read it yhears ago. It is funny and endearing and teaches the shy readers that they need to stand up for what they think is right despite their own fears."
5,a photographic exploration of the land of light.,"this book takes you on a tour of the land the people and the history of Ghost Ranch New Mexico. the photographs by Janet Russek adn David Scheinbaum are compelling and stunning and expole all aspects of the area. along with the amazing pictures in the book, the essays by well noted southwest historians bring light to the history of the land the people and the union that has occured between the two for cunturies."
5,The One Year Bible,My husband and I each have a copy of this Bible. We just love it! It makes the Bible fun to read and you get such a feeling of accomplishment from keeping up-to-date.The Bible can be hard to wade through. This makes it pleasant and we are learning so much! What a good guide to life God has given us!
3,Kindle edition misses the point,"This is just a book, after all, but the whole reason for a One-Year Bible is to read it one day at a time, organized by day. I haven't been able to find any way to navigate to a specific calendar day in the navigation section of the book. Simply offering a choice of ""today"" and have the book take you to that day's reading would be a major improvement."
5,The One Year Bible,"The One Year Bible is AMAZING, plus the condition it can in was as promised! I am very very pleased as it was a Birthday present for a friend of mine. She hasn't put it down since I gave it to her!!!"
5,A Must Have,The daily readings are not too long or too short...Just enough to give you something to reflect on.
5,Outstanding Service,"Outstanding services and planning to order thur them again.Great Commution.Get 5 stars.Douglas, Escondido,Ca"
5,must read,I enjoy reading the bible in this way.Helps me to get a little bit in each day. Try reading each day. It will bring you closer to God.
4,Very good but not perfect,"This was a replacement for a copy that was stolen. (Sheesh! Stealing a Bible? What's the world coming to?) Anyway, I've been reading The One Year Bible for the last several years and I find it very helpful in daily Bible reading. The only thing I'd like to change is that the notea are at the end of the section, as endnotes, rather than at the bottom of the same page as footnotes."
5,So easy to read anywhere!,"I love having this on my kindle that I can have with me at all times, no need to carry around a tattered, bulky book. I have read this book over and over and now I will always have it and never have to replace it!"
3,The one Year Bible,The NIV is not as literal a translation as I would like. Nevertheless the format/layout is very useful when sharing in a group study
4,The One Year Bible NIV,"I have always wanted to read the Bible, and have started more than once only to have put it down and not picking up again. I don't see that happening with this book and how the Bible is covered."
3,One Year Bible,"The only problem with this Bible is the very small print. If that's an issue for you, buy a larger one. Other than that, the version is easy to read and it's nice that it is small enough to throw in a purse or bag."
5,The One Year Bible NIV,Excellent way to read the Bible in a year. Love the way it is organized and reads like a novel.
4,THE GREETER,I GAVE THIS BIBLE AS A GIFT AND MY FRIEND HAS THOROUGHLY ENJOYED HIS DAILY READINGS . I NOW PURCHASE THE ONE CHORONOLOGICAL BIBLE NLT AND PERSONALLY THINK THAT IT'S A BETTER READ .
4,The One Year Bible,This is a great format for people who want to read through the bible in one year. It is organized in such a way that getting through the bible is less daunting than one might think. It is especially good for those who are new to reading the bible.
5,Great family project,"For our family New Year's resolution, we want to grow spiritually, so my husband and I bought this book to read with our 10 year old son each night (when possible). It is great! A little of the old testament with a little of the new testament with a nice psalm or proverb...great way to read the Bible and make it not so intimidating! Great way to create dialog with our son---would definitely recommend. Wish I would have done this years ago with this book!"
5,Blessed to find a recent version.,"Received a bible from friends of mine about 9 years ago, and it was falling apart due to the harsh temperatures I subject the Bible in my car. I was very, very happy to have found a newer version (larger text) of an incredible everyday tool for worship and meditation! AMEN ... PRAISE GOD!"
2,The One Year Bible: New international Version,I was very disapppointed in the size of the book and especially the size of the print. It will be quite difficult for me to read and will make reading it much less enjoyable. I wise it had been in the discription of the book when it was presentedl
2,"Basically what I wanted, but...","Trying to read my regular-sized bible every day is overwhelming. This is pretty much what I was looking for, but I wish the words of Christ were in red (as they are in every other NIV I've ever seen). Plus, there are random passages that are bolded...it took me a awhile, but I found the explanation that these were ""crucial passages"" -- okay. Says who, exactly?Update: I am no longer even trying to use it daily -- because although the concept of the Old Testament is okay, the rest of it is too intermittent. It's one thing to read 2 pages of Old Testament every day, but reading one psalm or one single entry from Proverbs is not conducive, for me, to deep study. A great concept for the Old Testament only, but I would not buy again."
2,Small print,"I am no where needing reading glasses yet, but the small size of the print in this bible would have required a magnifying glass. I'm sure that if I could have read it the book would have been fine. Additionally when I returned the book, Amazon wouldn't pay any of the shipping and they were going to back charge me for the free shiping since it wasn't their fault the print was so small."
4,No more morning hassles,This is a brilliant bible reading guide. I no longer have to search for the daily readings while still trying to open my eyes; it's all there ready to go!
1,Too small print,Too small print for usual Bible reader and it wasn't advertised as the compact copy when we ordered it from the page we ordered it from. Had to send it back. We did finally get one that we like very much. The one that has notes by F. Lagard Smith and we are very happy with that. Thanks for your opportunity to express our thoughts. Tom Thomas
5,Am very pleased,I am very pleased with this product. I appreciate the bold scripture in each days reading and like the compact size.
5,Bible,"I love having the convenience of my Bible on my iPad. This version includes Old Testament, New Testament, Psalms and Proverbs readings each day."
2,print,the print is too small. even with my glasses I can't read itto I was so disappointed. a description of the font should be available
3,SMALLEST FONT EVER!,"This book is for those with a magnifying glass. I am 25 years old, and no where near losing my eye sight, but this book is microscopic!"
4,In a Perfect World CD,"If you like Gene Watson, you will love this CD....I have listened to this for days and I never get tired of it....I just love his voice and his music..."
4,Gene watson,"As always, Gene Watson delivers great country music. I have been collecting his msuic from the git go and like a fine wine he gits better with age."
3,yadda,It was a good cd and it was good to hear Gene Watson again since it has been years since he had a hit. He's an oldie but a goodie.
3,Needs More Carl,"The ""author's"" forwards lend nothing to the thoughts of von Clausewitz. It would be a much better read if Carl's thoughts were the extent of the book."
1,A huge disappointment,A Secret Eye was a huge disappointment. The characters were not as developed and colorful as one might expect. The diary/journal form became ho-hum after the first few entries. The dragging subjects and subject matter made the 470 pages difficult to wade through. Augusta has always been my home and I did enjoy some of the local history. I am certain a more interesting story could have been told about my hometown.
2,Not that great.,"I was surprised to hear how many folks liked this magazine. I was disappointed that the book was actually a flimsy magazine and for the price I would have passed. Many of the pages are filled with advertisements. The layouts were uncreative and nothing exciting. The recipes were also not as descriptive and complete as others that I've seen. I also found that if you do not have children many of the ideas were not useful. I would not recommend this magazine. There are plenty of other choices that are better for the money. This magazine is not robust to sustain any tough handling. Although there are a couple of simple ideas to get started, I have to admit it wouldn't be the first book I would reach for."
1,Disappointed,Expensive magazine. I expected this to be a paperback book rather than a magazine complete with advertisements.
5,I use this every day!,"Every single time I sit down to scrap and have my photos chosen, I reach for this book. I've rarely made a layout without using it since I picked it up. I love that Becky gives you the sketch and three interpretations of it so you can really see how it can work. Its the size of a magazine and has sketches for 2-page layouts using 4 to 10+ photos. Very useful!!!"
1,Where is Johnette Napolitano?????,"When I heard the Johnette Napolitano track in the movie, I automatically wanted to go out and get the soundtrack. I was very dissapointed to learn that it had somehow been left off of the cd.... Hopefully, this track will see a release."
2,not worth it,This is definatly not worth the money they sell it for. Though they were in great condition when I got them the product itself is very flimsy. These would be great for kids just learning the art but I would not recommend them for adults or tournament use as the light material makes technique look sloppy
3,Graphic SF Reader,"Green Arrow is fighting an ethically challenged, or even evil corporation who will stop at nothing to get the sort of real estate deal and development that they want, through.His head is turned by a woman that it should not be, and this causes tragedy and a confrontation. He still has the criminals and the monsters to deal with."
3,pictures were not ssme as product,I ordered a converter. It came in time but when I opened box the breakers were missing. The picture showed breakers. Now I have to buy breakers
4,power supply 7345,can't rate it higher because had to replace 3 of them in the last 15 years on a couple of my trailers.do like them though they are not that hard to change.
2,to unorganized for me,this game was really long to me and very hard to keep up with and the fighting was kind of lame
1,And the score is no longer perfect. Kurplunk!,"If you wanna add to the noise and give me yet another bad vote for my review, so be it. But I didn't understand this game at all. I was looking for a strategy RPG and this mess didn't cut it at all.Although the characters as a whole in this series are very intriguing, especially the fire dude, this game was flat out weird and confusing.And it's not fun. Take my word for it! It's abysmal and such.I really tried to get into it, but I didn't understand all of it! And when I played, I was like, this is it? I gotta fight this zombie dude, and that's it? And he was kinda hard. It seemed very hard and was frustrating, so I sold it!1 star. Not fun at all.1 star."
4,"Good, different, but good","For anyone who doesn't have the album, don't buy this expecting Blink style. If it compares to Blink, then think of Adams Song, or stay together for the kids. The whole album is mellow, accept for my first punk song, which had energy I didn't know Tom was capable of. Mark does have a guest appearance on it, as well as Tim Armstrong of Rancid, which added another star to the rating. I think Tims appearance was just a wink to Travis saying thanks for joining their new band, the Transplants. I would expect for most to get tired of this cd after listening to it more than three or four times."
4,Boxcar Racer,"This is a good album. Most the songs are a lot harder than typical Blink and they are all very good. Without Mark you kind of feel like there is something missing but his guest vocals on ""Elevator"" are awesome. I'd reccomend this CD to anyone that liked Blink 182 or anyone that likes punk."
4,Box Car Racer,"Very good album. Did not expect much. Album highlights Travis Barker's remarkable talents behind the kit; he is definitely one of the most gifted and underrated drummers to emerge in the past 10 years. Enjoyed the special guest stars, especially 'Elevator' in which Tom and Mark Hoppus team up to bring that Blink-182 charm back into the ears of the listener.Tom Delonge shows his growth as a song-writer, creating songs that envoke memories of punk artists past. As I listen, I can remember sitting in my room listening to the likes of Rancid, Fugazi & the Ramones.I strongly recommend purchasing the cd, but if not, at least download some of the music and see what you are missing."
4,Boxcar Racer,"Like Blink but leaning more to the pop punk on the newer albums. i was hoping it would be more like dude ranch but not as goofy, more hardcore punk. But still its a good cd evem if its not really punk. if you want real punk go buy a pennywise cd or dude and before from blink 182."
1,This angers me,"A few years ago i heard Blink 182, and i liked some of their songs... a few years later and i started to hate it. And then Box car racer came along... which was even worse, in fact i think i heard my 5 year old cousin listening to this.. Sad part is box car racer's singer has the same voice as my 5 year old cousin! I Feel so is one of the worst songs ive ever heard. There are hundreds of bands out there who deserve to be seen but only bands like this are shown cause it is 'mainstream'. We need to start acctually LISTENING to these bands.. anyone can tell Box Car Racer is horrible in both their music and lyrics."
1,Terrible CD,"I listened to this cd only because alot of people said it was really good. This cd is so bad and I can't belive that people like it. These songs have no meaning, the lyrics are stupid and if you want to listen to real punk rock, listen to the ramones, rancid or the sex pistols"
1,punk??,"These guys are all from blink, The singer sounds like a little girl.If u want some real good voices and screams check out linkin park or nirvana. check out The Ataris if u like blink style music, but with much better vocals, The guy actually sounds like a guy..."
1,GRRR,ok where is mark?? HMMM?? why did tom and travis just RANDOMLY start a new band without mark?? GEEEEEZ i mean mark is like a really good bass guitarist and he is sooo hott!! AND FUNNY!! he is what made me listen to blink 182!! i refuse to let blink fans buy this cd its not cool nop not atall!!
1,WAT?!?,"STOP AND LISTEN! wat is ur guys problem! this cd is terrible! do u realize wat this is! this is blink without the greatest part of them! MARK! MARK IS ONE OF THE WORLDS GREATEST SINGERS! how can u make a blink cd without him! i give five stars to Blink 182 (self titled), Enema of the state, and 4 for take off ur pants and jacket! Blink is my fav band and Mark is my fav singer! Wat WERE U THINKING TOM! MARK MARK MARK MARK MARK!!!! peace out"
1,this cd just plain out horrible,"granted ""feel so"" is a good song...but besides that this cd is horrible...first of all...i cant think of anyone from blink being emocore...secondly, all the songs sound the same and it gives me the biggest twitch, latly the drumming is way to annyoying ye its pretty good that y i gave this cd a one star..barely worth that"
3,"Dude, this is TOTALLY Blink 182.","If you're a fan of Refused and Fugazi, then you will not be happy with this CD. However, if you are a boi or grrl starting to feel a bit too old to show up at a Blink 182 show, then you just may enjoy this more ""mature"" derivative of the band. It's a little short on the cool guitar riffs and intense vocals of their referenced influences, but the overall sound is a little more interesting than their day band."
4,Good stuff,"With the exception of Cat Like Thief and My First Punk Song, this album is very good. Very well-written, well-performed and even experimental at times (listen to drummer Travis Barker's unconventional beats)Highly recommended, even more than Blink 182. Crazy."
3,You've gotta be in the mood for it,"This isn't a bad cd, it just isn't a great cd. The songs are pretty repetitive, so by the 10th or 11th track, you think it's the third time through the cd.All in all though, if I'm in the mood for it, it's a good cd, I just won't be able to listen to it all the time, like I can Less Than Jake or Soul Coughing. And if you're just looking for another Blink 182 cd, this isn't it. It doesn't have that same catchy, pop-punk sound to it."
3,Box Car Racer,"I'd have to say that this sounds like another Blink-182 CD. If Tim Armstrong from Rancid were not their special musical guest then it would have [been bad]. Hearing Tom DeLounge's voice 13 times in 13 songs can give you a bad headache. Theres only about 3 good songs on the CD. If your a Blink-182 fan your probably going to love this CD. Me? I don't really like Blink, in fact I dislike them. So go buy a CD and see for yourself, prove me wrong."
4,Tom Grew Up,"This cd is very different than a Blink 182 cd, however one ""funny"" song still made it on the cd(My First Punk Song). All the songs talk about grown up topics from seeing someone jump off a building(Elevator) to loving a girl(There is). The only bad thing about this cd is that almost every song seems to end the same way, like Tom used a formula to write the songs. They all end with a long repetition of the chorus, for some songs this is good, but others it kind of sucks and is repetative. Buy this cd if you like punk bands that arent fast, but are more melodic. If you like Tom's voice, buy this cd because on 10 of 13 songs, he is the only one singing. I like this cd."
1,Total and utter nonsense.,"I can't believe that Tom DeLonge and Travis Barker even had the gall to put this junk out. It's just the next Blink 182 album, minus the singer who's voice is actually tolerable (Mark) and plus more awful, awful lyrics from Tom. Not to mention that the music isn't much of a departure from Blink's usual poppy, 3-chord fare. It's only amusing to think that Box Car Racer are referred to as Tom and Travis' ""emo"" band and they compared themselves to Fugazi and Quicksand. If you want to buy something that is good, maybe actually get a Fugazi album or something. Dare to explore. These 30-something teenagers sure didn't."
3,hot tracks,the album had some really good songs but they were missing something humor.If you like the new album of blink 182 u will love the album of box car racer.!
4,REVIEWING BOX CAR RACER,this cd was very good. I liked all there songs excpetially there first song it was almost as good as the other albums. There voices are awsome the music is awsome it was very good I gave this album four stars out of five because even though i really like blink 182 this album doesnt have that much punk as they did in some of the other albums such as take off your pants and jacket. well thanx for reading this and i hope you enjoy the cd
4,Good album...,"First off, let me start by saying, if you're a Blink fan, and buy this expecting to hear Blink 182, then you've wasted your money. While some of the tracks do sound a bit like Blink, most of them the only thing connecting them to Blink 182 is the unmistakeable sound of Tom Delonge's voice. Favorite song on the album would have to be ""I Feel So."" Other good songs include ""All Systems Go,"" ""Tiny Voices,"" and the song, ""Letters to God."" It starts out accoustic, then midway through the song, kicks it up a notch. In the song, Tom seams to be talking about his fear of dying, ""I won't lie, I won't sin, maybe I don't wanna go, can't you wait.""I'd say overall, it's a good CD, and I'm sure it will get plenty of playing time in my cd changer while I'm cruisin. For the teeny boppers on MTV screaming ""Tom is SOOOOOOO hot,"" don't buy this, please, please, just leave it alone."
5,Great CD,"Anyone that is a blink-182 fan will also love Boxcar Racer. And for anyone that is upset about no Mark, ""Elevator"" is an awesome song that Mark is in! I love this CD!"
4,A good side project,"This almost could have been a Blink album. Almost. The subject matter is more serious and the music a little heavier, but at it's core, this is still pop music. (which is a good thing, because Tom Delonge writes great pop music) The influence of Fugazi, prevalent throughout much of this album, can also be found in Blink material (""Please Take Me Home"", for one). Several reviewers on this site have mentioned the influence of Refused, but I don't hear it. Hopefully, this album can turn some of the MTV crowd on to more serious punk music that they would otherwise never be exposed to.Overall, a good album that's worth having, just don't expect anything radically different."
3,Not quite what i expected,"After i saw ""I Feel So"" on MTV i thought: ""man, this album is gonna kick some serious [behind]"" boy, i tell ya, i was wrong. I went to FYE and bought this so called ""album"". I expected some good, mature and well elaborated album, when i played this CD in my stereo and heard the whole record, i was so damn dissapointed.The lyrics just (stink), they have short songs and the music sounded the same in every song.The reason I gave this ""album"" 3 stars is:1. I Feel So2. There Is3. ElevatorI personally don't recomend this CD, it doesn't have what it takes to become a real ALBUM.Take care, seeya soon."
4,"Sounds less punky, but still good","If you are one of those people that think Blink182 has sold out over recent years, then you probably won't like Boxcar Racer. The CD is less punk than most blink stuff, but still pretty good. ""I feel so"" is already a hit and I think ""Letters to God"" will make it on the radio too. There are some high flying songs on the album that remind me of Blink. Most of the CD, however, offers a slightly different sound. I really like track 5, ""Cat Like Thief"".Tom does most of the vocals, but receives some guest help in a few songs, including an appearance from Mark Hoppus in ""Elevator"". All in all, if you like alternative, and Blink's newer CDs (Enema of the State and Take off your pants and Jacket), then I recommend this one. Blink is my favorite band, and I really like this CD."
5,darker and deeper...,"Not nearly as sophomoric as a lot of the songs on any given Blink album (don't read that wrong, juvenile lyrics are one of the reasons I love Blink), Box Car Racer manages to combine darker lyrics and a serious vibe witout losing the completely catchy riffs and infectious tunes of the best pop-punk out there today.Listening to ""Watch the World"" reminds me of why I've enjoyed seeing Blink 182 throw a few more serious tunes on their albums, and why I sometimes wish they would stick with that vibe for a few more songs. Sometimes you wanna rock out to a less-mature punk album and other times you want something with a little more substance - this one combines the great melodic, hard-charging Blink sound with songs that feel a bit more sincere. If you've been a fan of Blink 182, purchasing this should be a no-brainer."
2,Original? Where?,"I must say I am extremely dissapointed by the latest Blink 182...oops...I meant the Box Car Racer CD. That's right, any of these songs could be found on a Blink 182 CD. This CD was supposed to be true punk rock, and less pop stuff like standard Blink 182. That is flat-out not true.Feel so is an excellent song, and the main reason I purchased this CD. Unfortunately it is far from the ""less mainstream"" sound that was anticipated. If you want true punk, go get a Pennywise CD, if you want pop-punk go buy a Blink CD...they are better than this anyway. Just download Feel So."
4,good one,this is a great album all the songs are more serious than blink songs and its kind of a hint into what blink-182 is now having more serious songs my favorite song on the album is elevator but what i dont get is why everyone thinks tom is a good singer have you people heard him live come on now hes really monotone but i still like him and this album is a good one
3,Box Car Racer's Self Titled CD,"I've not been a Blink fan for that long..About half a year yet I'm a huge fan. I expected this CD to be better, it has some excellent songs like There Is, Elevator, and I Feel So..Tiny Voices is another good song on this cd. As far as the songs I mentioned nothing else is ""ok"". If you listen to There Is and then My 1st Punk Song it seems like I made the song, not Box Car. I was expecting better personally--If I could only buy one CD I'd buy Sticks and Stones by NFG. Other then the 3 songs I mentioned, the cd was a let down."
4,"Boxcar Racer- eh, not 2 bad","Boxcar racer is pretty good when u put it all together. If you like heavy metal, the song for you is my first punk song. All the other songs are the same but still really good. There is only one song that I didn't really like but I wont mention it because thats only my opinion and that's the only reason I rate it four stars. All in all, this CD is very good, although it may have a few swear words, only about ten in the whole CD, the CD is still great. Travis and Tom from blink 182 are in this CD but I personally think Boxcar Racer is better the Blink 182. Boxcar Racer is great!"
2,average stuff here,"Well, I used to enjoy Blink182 quite a bit back with the Cheshire Cat and Dude Ranch albums. Either I've grown bored with age, or it just really is novel and it gets old (take your pick as to which). Anyway, I gave Boxcar a chance, because I read that the style was going to be different with serious lyrics. Well, yes it is a little different than Blink musically, less pop-punk, and yes the lyrics aren't as juvenile. However, Tom's vocals are just unbearable for an entire album (in fact see him live and see just how unbearable and out of tune they really are). There are plenty of those typical Blink palm muted guitar parts, which has gotten a bit stale too. I'm sure plenty of this stuff will be watering down the airwaves. I'll give this 2 stars, because it is right in the middle, meaning average. Recommended only for those of generic musical tastes, or die-hard Blink fans."
5,I love this cd![.],"Wow, my goodness! this is the best freakin' album ever! Ok, well, maybe not ""ever"" but its soooo good. I love every song. I listen to it every morning before school. With the exception of ""My first punk song"" every song is soooo great!! I do have to say that the sound is a little differnt from that of Blink182. But is still wonderfulicious none the less! I really dont know if this will help anyone but hey, I just had to say how good this album is:) peace!~Kaylin"
4,this is not a Blink-182,"I found a dark CD on the first self-tilted album of Box Car Racer, This is more agressive than a Blink-182 CD, more mature but I miss my Blink-182 friends and I want these guys (new album 2003 I know!) but the bx car racer album is great in his self..."
2,stick with blink,"This CD is really dissapointing. I mean, I am a huge blink182 fan, they are one of my favorite bands, but this is nothing like Blinks great stuff. This album has a few good tracks, but the rest is poor, in my opinion. This just shows how crucial Mark Hoppus is to Blink 182. Download the few good songs from Boxcar, and forget buying the CD. Save your money."
2,one of many,"OK I picked up this album because it was supposed to be the new Blink.Well its more hardcore punk. Some of the songs I really, really dont like. A few were actually good, but most were just ok. If i had previewed the cd first I most likely wouldn't have bought it."
2,They Ain't No Blink,"If you are planning on buying this album - don't unless you're a huge fan. If you like Blink 182, Green day, NFG etc, you will be disappointed, I know I was. My First Punk Song is the standout track, at at only one minute long that's saying something. The 30 seconds or so at the start of the intro to I Feel So are pure class, but then the prospect of a decent song is ruined by an over-loud instrumental. Mark Hoppus' input makes Elevator the only decent full-lenth track on the whole album, and here's why. Box Car Racer is a cliched rant by a rich little boy who seems to think his life is terrible. Too many obvious references to 9/11 make it an irritating listen, to anyone outside of the USA anyway. The fact is, if it was anyone else it would be a half-decent effort, but you can't help comparing it to Blink, and it just doesn't match up. Tom and Trav, don't give up the day job yet guys. (See, I can use cliches too!)"
1,I'll be honest...,"I haven't listened to this entire album. And you know what? I'm not going to either. With Blink-182, Mark and Tom played pop punk that had nothing I could take seriously anyways. But this?! This is insulting! Amazon.com says that it refferences Fugazi. I disagree. This CD RIPS OFF FUGAZI(although only musical. Mark could never write lyrics like Ian and Guy). The difference? Mark attacks the ""big issues"" and does pretty good job of whining about them too. This is inane. You want really punk or hardcore, try some Fugazi, Dead Kennedy's, or Minor Threat. There is nothing credible about bad music. Period."
4,Interesting,"I love the guitar and stuff. The sound is great, my first punk song sucks, but other then that the CD kicks ass. The reason I gave it a 4/5 is because its like amazing blink 182 without mark, and mark vocals are so heartfelt, I love them, butthis is still a great album."
5,evolution,"I never liked blink 182 that much. While their musical talent was obvious, I always found that they lacked emotion and sincerity(in their lyrics and sound). That is where this album really shines at times. Some of the stuff is just like old blink, but a few of the songs really stand out. Letters to God, I Feel So, There Is, and Watch the World are just a few of the songs that are pretty powerful lyrically, vocally, and instrumentally. You can really lose yourself in some of these songs."
4,Beautiful small thing,"As side projects go, this one simply works. I just keep coming back to it for some reason. It's Blinky in all the right ways, while pushing Blink's more scatological material aside for the moment and going more in the direction of ""Adam's Song."" I can hardly object.I can't help but worship the phenomenal work that Travis does on these songs. (Yeah, drummer speaking.) Tom's voice remains glaringly untrained, but that's always been a big part of Blink's brash charm, and it works here as well. ""I Feel So"" is a tall drink of water, as are ""And I"" and ""There Is."" (Okay, so they don't always finish their phrases. Thou shalt forgive.)"
3,I feel so pissed,"this is a very disapoiting cd. tom and travis were right to come back to blink, but this album is what ruined blinks new cd.i liked i feel so, but the rest sux. i hate it when people say""this song saved the album"" cause theres no way one song can do that. thax 2 box car racer, the future of blink was ruined....."
4,"very nicely made dominos, fun game",Others have complained about the domino quality but I think that they may not have the premium set. These dominos look and feel terrific. The game is lots of fun. The rules are a little more nuanced than you might expect so you will have to play 4 or 5 games before you learn the various exceptions and rare moves. The written instructions are comprehensive but not all that easy to understand. I took this on a recent family vacation and had to do some arm-twisting to get people to play but once they started they got into it. You do need a really large table even with a few players.
2,Not What It Claims To Be,"I love Metallica and I love the DVD's that talk about various artists songs, and how to play them. But here is my main gripe with a majority of these kinds of DVD's, including this one: They don't include ANY of the second guitar parts for most of the songs! Let me give you a specific example:On ""Until It Sleeps"" there are obviously two guitars playing, along with some overdubbed stuff. So James and Kirk playing (different parts), plus at least one overdub in some parts. In this ""in depth analysis"" they ONLY include James' part for the ENTIRE song, except the solo. So that second harmony chord part you hear on the CD is completely absent here.And it's the same for all the other songs as well. You are getting anything BUT an in depth analysis, and if you already have the sheet music for these songs, this adds absolutely NOTHING of value to it, so skip it."
3,Fine but...,The ten-pound doggie doesn't mind riding in this. There is a strap that clips onto her harness that would keep her from jumping out. It is sturdy and well made. The only problem is that there is a strut that supports the bottom and it rubs against the tube when turning left and right. It rubs the paint off and I fear it is now damaging the metal. I contacted the manufacturer and they just don't care. I even suggested a solution of them supplying something to protect against this problem but they simply do not care.
4,Priced to High,This is a very good product. The candy has a very good flavor. It really helps to have an alternative when you are dieting. The only problem I find is that you can buy these at Walmart for under $2 a bag....so they need to sell these for less. Also keep extras in the fridge cause they do get sticky when they melt in the summer heat.
2,melted mess,Being diaetic i love this product. Problem with storage prior to and or during shipping. Upon arrival the first bag was a sticky mess. They do not stnd up to heat. Amazon made it right.. have to wait for cooler temperatures.
5,Very informative and readable,"This is an excellent and up-to-date book about galactic astronomy that can be read by just about any interested person. It has an enormous amount of descriptive material about galactic anatomy, the Milky Way Galaxy, the Magellenic Clouds, the Local Group, Clusters, and Superclusters. It discusses the problem of the ""missing mass,"" and of galactic origin and evolution. There's an introduction to interacting and starburst galaxies, to ultra-luminous infrared galaxies, to radio galaxies, Seyfert galaxies, Gamma-ray bursters, and Quasars. All in all, it is an easy way to learn a great deal about the subject: it has more meat than most books for the layman but is easy to understand."
3,Great shirt,"This is a very nice quality shirt, only disappointment is that they did not offer a chart showing the children's sizes and I ordered the wrong size."
5,lower control ball joint,"I bought this part 1 month ago and installed it myself on my 2004 mustang,so far the part is working good"
1,Paint flakes off,I bought this cover for my husband's LG phone. He used the cover for about one week and then threw the cover away. The cover was black and the paint would flake off revealing the cheap white plastic underneath. Product in my opinion was a waste of money.
5,awesome product,producr worke grea tjust like the package said it would loads of energy and focus with no jitters. great product guys
3,no sleep,these things did get me started on the right track but i took just one early in the morning and the sstill messed with my sleep....
2,Stim X,This stimulant X was about average when it comes others I did not find anything too fantastic about it. There are others out there that work way better than this one in my opinion.
1,I dont recommend this,"Okay, this made me feel sick, my skin was tingling, it was like abnormal. I have never took en caffeine and had THIS happen to me. Everything felt so weird i would have to describe it as a energized fever."
1,never again!,All I can say is if u wanna feel like you're going to have a heart attack then buy these pills.
5,Exactly as advertised,Received 2-pill sample and took them yesterday. I felt alert for at least 8 hours with no jitters. The tired body an tired eyes feeling was eliminated. I will purchase this product soon.
1,Energy pills,I got my free sample. Took one pill around 11 a.m. to give me some energy to do my daily chores. Waited an hour and felt nothing so I took the 2nd pill and WHOA! I had tons of energy but a couple hours into it I felt nauseous and yuck. It may have been I took it on an empty stomach or that I was highly senstivive to the ingredients.
5,Great for on the run energy,I like the fact that this energy stimulant is pill form that can be taken with just a glass of water.
2,good & bad,The product gives you energy all day and suppresses your appetite as advertised. The drawback is it gave me rashes and made me scratch like crazy for the first two months and then started to subside. It lasted approx. 3 1/2 months in all. Caused scratching all over. Basically no areas omitted. Be careful with this product. Also makes it smell MUCH more when going to the bathroom.
1,not original red pills. do not be fooled by picture.,the picture of the bottle and the price being double would lead you to believe that this is the original red pill formula. do not be fooled. i ordered expecting this and received the newer blue and white pills that i could have ordered for half the price under a different listing. RIP OFF!!!!
2,Felt like it worked for 1 day,"I was super excited when I tried this product and it made me not hungry. That was for one day, then I got sick, then it just stopped working. Save your money!"
2,Made Me Feel Weird...,"This product was okay to begin with, but unfortunately when I upped the dosage to 2 per day as recommended I started getting bad side effects. I had chest pains and was still hungry even after taking down the dosage. I am only 22 and have used other diet pills before and never had such negative side effects. Definitely not like Slim Xtreme, that was a great diet pill...too bad it was discontinued because this is not a good substitute."
5,Excellent pre-workout prep,"Anabolic Xtreme Stimulant X (Energy & Mind Formula) definitely gets me ready for intense weight training and cardio workouts. As to the manufacturer's ""fat burning"" claim - they will not help a person lose weight unless combined with a healthy diet and regular exercise. They do make my workout sessions more intense, thus equating to more total calories burned during a workout and a higher resting metabolic rate after a workout. I take one pill 20-30 minutes before each workout. I have also used them to put a pep in my step after have a late evening of cocktails (it knocks a hangover right out of my system). One pill is the perfect dose for me; two really put me on edge. I also avoid taking them after 3pm, as they otherwise tend to keep me awake past my midnight bedtime."
3,no more hunger,Keeps my appetite surpressed and my energy high. Body will adjust to servings just as with anything else. Good product for a good price.
5,Perfect for Traveling,"These changing pads are great to have around in your diaper bag and for traveling. The surface is soft and doesn't bother baby's skin. It dries pretty fast too -- sometimes the baby will get a little spit up on it. I just let it dry and it's fine, so you don't have to throw the whole pad away. It's thick enough that moisture doesn't soak all the way through."
2,Leaves fuzzies on baby's bottom!,"Purchased these elsewhere after seeing them here b/c wanted to have them immediately. Intended to purchase them here as well. However, this product leaves fuzzies on baby's bottom--wether or not baby has urinated on the pad--which then must be wiped off before putting on diaper. Easier to just use the standard vinyl/wipable changing pad with a paper towel and just wipe the pad off when necessary."
1,"Villazon good, but Netrebko big disappointment","Traviata is my favourite Verdi opera and I have gathered at home quite a collection of cds and dvds with some of the greatest Violettas: Callas, Gheorghiu, Sutherland, Moffo, etc. I bought this item based on amazon reviews, but the fact of the matter is that I regret having bought it: I like the tenor and the baritone, but Netrebko did not convince me as Violetta.- act I: her coloratura is barely satisfactory and not what one would expect from a regular singer at the MET...- act II: her Amami Alfredo was weak; she went off tune rather often;- act III: I got no sense of the frailty and tragedy of Violetta - she failed to convince dramatically.So if you are a big fan of Villazon, you may want to buy this dvd for his good Alfredo; but if you are like me and you can't imagine a good La Traviata with a mediocre Violetta, save your money."
5,The best Traviata ever...,"Orchestra, singers (Netrebko, Villazon, Hampson), setup... By far the best Traviata ever!If you are new to opera, start with this one but be advised that all other Traviatas will look poor."
5,Awesome!!!!,"Surely a must have for collectors! Never seen before production of La Traviata. Hip, modern and inspiring! Not to be missed by any Opera lover and persons who wants to see a modern version of this maginificent world class cast and production."
4,rolando is the greatest,Anna Netrebko is a very great soprano. She has that wonderful Russian dark quality to her voice. But Rolando Villazon is something so special. He is so good looking and such a great singer -along with his acting ability and that could make him one of the greats someday. I am new to opera and got hooked when the 3 tenors came on TV. I will gladly shell out any hard earned cash I have for anything by Rolando Villazon.
2,book,I didn't really like this book... they are not as simple as I thought they would be nor are all the ingredients easily accessible.
5,Something funny that is also highly useful!!,This book had me howling with laughter at its trivial tales of office back-stabbing and how to deal with a variety of nasty colleagues. We all have them! The author offers some fine principles to live by for those of us who must be subjected to the capitalist life-plan of 9 to 5! A must to help us all keep our wits and sanity intact!
4,Twelve Truths,"Karen Randall is very either/or about the office culture. Some offices are great and then there are the crazy ones. This is a survival guide for the office that is not nice, polite, fair, or even fun. Helps you to survive and succeed."
3,A no-nonsense look at rank-and-file office politics,"Generally informative, although I was hoping to learn more about why the executives (who unleash the dysfunctional managers and supervisors on the rest of us) think and act the way they do.The advice in this book is strong enough for a man, but made for a woman."
1,This book is all gripe and no grounds.,A few grains of truth and tidbits of helpful information are hidden between piles of stories that are barely relevant and poorly organized. The author borders on sounding paranoid in her discussion of officemates. I wish I hadn't spent the money.
4,Good Fan but replacement bulb hard to find,Installed this fan about a year ago and it works fine although it's a little louder than I was expecting but not nearly as loud as the home builders original fan. Finding replacement bulbs can be a challenge but at the time of this writing they were available on Amazon - search for MaxLite MLS13GUSWW GU24 Spiral Base 13 watt Compact Fluorescent
2,Not as quiet as it is advertised.,"This fan was installed over our toilet as part of a bathroom remodel. It is rated at 0.9 sones (which should be barely audible) but it is much louder than a much larger Hunter fan was installed by our walk-in shower (Model 82033 which is rated at 1.5 sones). One Sone is equivalent to the sound of a quiet refrigerator in a quiet kitchen. This fan is significantly louder than that!The fan seems to move a good amount of air and we like the light and nightlight. But, the noise level is much louder than we had expected. So, our contractor ordered a second fan and replaced it. Sadly, the replacement fan is only a tiny bit quieter but still much louder than its larger brother. We are looking for another brand as I now doubt a third one from Hunter of this size will be any quieter."
4,Useful but limited...,"A few years back, this book was the only game in town for anyone who wanted to scan a list of slang options for a given word. Good selection of words. Trouble is, it's extremely cumbersome to search for a word, because many words are filed under a less familiar slang word -- to look up ""marijuana,"" you have to look under ""pot."" ""Drunk"" is found under ""on the sauce."" There is an index system, but it's not terribly efficient."
3,Hard to Use,"I find using this book interesting in that, once I find a key word, I can see dozens and dozens of slang words that mean more or less the same thing. Opening to a page at random, I see ""Jeez"" as the header word: the synonyms listed under it take up pretty much the entire page. I like that because I can browse through these words, maybe 100 of them, and select the one whose shade of meaning I'm looking for.But: understanding the shade of meaning depends on me, the user. That information isn't given in the book. And, as another reviewer pointed out, neither the year of first use nor the origin of the slang term is given.The index takes up about half of the total number of pages. It's difficult to move back and forth between the ""dictionary"" part of the book and the index part. Nevertheless, if I want a lot of slang synonyms for one term, I always check this book, mainly to get an overview."
5,Excellent Teaching Tool,The Life & Times of Baxter The Bat Dog takes me back to fond memories of animals stories I read as a child. The book is well written and the illustrations are very well done. It kept my children's attention throughout. I like the way the author has cats as Baxter's best friends. This book helps teach children about sharing and getting along with others who are different from themselves in a subtle way. I am going to recommend this book as a teaching aid to my colleagues.
4,Promising but it could be more detailed.,"SPECIFICS:Page Count: 144Number of images: 98Small images: 4Half page images: 3Full page images: 802-page spreads: 11BW images: 3TEXT:1 page dedication1 page introduction1 page about the Elektra artworkART:12 images: 5 stars40 images: 4 stars46 images: 3 stars0 images: 2 stars0 images: 1 starOverall: 3,5 starsThis is a review of the first 123 pages.Pages 124 to 131 display interior art and text.Pages 132 to 135 have a step by step tutorialPages 136 to 139 show several sketches.Page 140 is a checklist of the artist worksPage 141 advertises the artist's web site.Pages 142 to 143 have photographs."
2,Kettlebell swing,"I just received this DVD today and am looking through the very informative ""how to swing"" section for an actual workout. I am very disapointed,there is a very short one, but nothing new. I only read the one reveiw on Amazon and wish I would have ordered a differnt DVD. I already know how to do a one and two handed swing and increase the weight as I go. I didnt learn anything new and now have to go back to the Amazon search section to try and find a Kettlebell workout DVD that has a workout included in the DVD.This was the biggest waste of money I have ever spent."
1,Don't Believe the Back Cover,I like some others thought this book would be different from the discription on the back cover. This book was very disturbing. I am afraid to say that I did not finish it. My time is so precious and there are so many other books to read. If you choose to read be aware that it is very violent. I would not only not recommend it but warn you against it.
1,Looking for something enjoyable to read? This isn't it!,"I read this book believing the back cover was accurate - a story about the struggles of a young woman growing up in Northern Ireland. It is less than that. It is grossly obscene and there is nothing funny about the demented family relationships. As a person of Irish descent, I found the book to be offensive, scattered, unconscientious, and pointless. I highly recommend that you don't read or purchase this book. I only finished it because I had the misguided hope that it would get better - it didn't."
2,Not Worth the Cost,The picture is deceiving; you only receive one ball that is 8 inches in diameter. I paid approximatly $20 for the item and an additional $10 for shipping. The product was defintly not worth the price.
5,T.J. and Garsed are one of the best all over the planet...,ok..this is not like the album Quid Pro Quo but it awesome again...liquid guitar sounds gonna touch your soul..
1,Rand McNally GPS Navigator,"I personally would not recommend anything from Rand McNally. I trusted there products and purchased the GPS and then they shortly thereafter discontinued this model and started selling Garmin's. They told me they have no intentions on updating the maps in the future for the Rand McNally Navigator (go figure, and they are the map experts!) My rating = Thumbs down to Rand McNally for lack of product support and not making available updates for a GPS bearing the Rand McNally name."
1,Caution - No longer made by Rand McNally,"As of about July, 2007Rand McNally no longer makes this item and has no suuport link on their website. I question if any updated maps or product improvements will be available. They now suggest Garmin navigators."
5,Great gadget and portable,"This is a great GPS device! It is very simple to set up and use immediately because the directions are very clear. It also comes with a small Rand McNally atlas and mount for the windshield.When you are actually driving the directions are given in a clear voice with plenty of warning time before a turn. It also includes estimated time of arrival and mileage for that trip. I can plan different routes with different stops and if I choose to go a different direction, the GPS will self correct and give me a new route.I have not used the MP3 yet, but I plan on loading songs soon.Great new product!"
3,"Good fan, but 1.3 sones?","I installed this fan in the master bath which is 11x12 over a year ago and at first I liked it. It was NOT as quite as I wanted, but better then the useless fan installed by the builder. The first thing I did was replace the cover with one from HD (I did not like the look and the color was not a ""true"" white like my ceiling. For the smaller second bath (9x10) I installed the Air King BFQ High Performance Bath Fan, 90-CFM 2.5 sones. Both fan do the job as the mirrors do not fog. But both are about the same as far as loudness? Maybe the hunter is a better fan, but not at more then 3 times the cost."
2,Starts Out Quiet But Dissapoints In No Time,"We installed this fan 8 weeks ago. When first installed it was whisper quiet, we couldn't even tell for sure that it was on. About a month after installation it began making more noise, a ticking sound. This sound has gotten increasingly worse. It sounds like something is loose, but my husband took it down, cleaned and examined it and could find no obvious reason for the noise. As time goes on I can only assume it will get noisier. I'm very disappointed in the fan's performance."
1,Canceled,"OK well this wasn't the best I saw on the site anyways but I figured it would be worth a try, but I will never know if it is worth anything or not. I bought this item and it was canceled due to being out of stock which is not what was said on the site. That alone however is not what really made me mad about this it took them a week to tell me it was out of stock and I did not even receive an email untill after the product was already overdue to be here. So I personaly would not buy from this company again due to the fact of as I said there are better products out there, incorrect info on the site, and the amount of time it them to correct this."
2,No More,"I just cannot continue reading this series,as I am getting bored with it.The author just does not hold my attention.I have no feelings one way or the other about the main character.I don't like or dislike him.the author could not bring him to life for me."
4,Wish I'd had this for my daughter,"This book hadn't been published when my daughter got her glasses as a pre-schooler. Wish it had been. A great daddy-daughter story especially when her father tenderly explains that while her glasses do make her different, she's also different because of her charm, her wit, and her curiosity. A book that affirms self-discovery, self-acceptance and the value of a sense of humor."
1,Not good for my daughter,"My 4-year-old daughter was actually excited about getting glasses...until we read this book. After picking out her new frames, we were about to leave the ophthalmalogist's office when she saw this book and asked me to read it to her. I figured it would be a cute book and couldn't hurt. Now I wish I could go back in time and tell her no. Yes, it's a cute book, but boy did it set us back. It created the idea in her head that she shouldn't like her glasses. Now she keeps saying she doesn't want to get glasses. And she was excited about them before reading this book! We'll see what happens once her glasses arrive, but I REALLY regret reading this book to her."
3,Luna and the Big Blur,I bought this book because my little boy was feeling insecure about his new glasses. The book is ok to teach children what glasses are for and about the doctor visit.
4,A Good Read Even for Guys,"Though clearly pitched to women, the writing and humor are strong enough to hold any reader. And beneath the humor, there's plenty here to learn from re navigating the shoals of modern life. This from a guy who was never that impressed by Thelma and Louise."
1,Couldn't read it - PRINT IS TOO SMALL,"This is my first ""review"" of a book I didn't read because the print was too small. I'm hoping more people who share this issue will complain via their reviews and publishers will get the message.I order most of the books I read from the library, so I don't know if a book is ""readable"" till I get it. I don't need ""large print"" books, but there's no excuse for a 6""x9"" paperback book to use print this small."
5,Lovely...,"This is so far the most sophisticated perfum I ever had. Only use this one for special ocassions. Just need spray once to smeel great all day long. Everybody ask me for it... believe me, you wont be dissapointed. Thanks J del Pozo, please continue making it...:)"
4,TIM MOORE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE SUCCESSFUL,"I'm glad to see Tim's work finally re-issued in CD. I think he had recorded somewhat like six albums but this self-titled one was the most famous because of the song ""Second Avenue"" which went to the US TOP 40 then by Art Garfunkel but I prefer Tim's own version more. ""Love Enough', 'Sister Lilac', 'Charmer' & ""A Fool Like You' also stood out.I gave this album 4 stars because his second album ""Behind The Eyes"" (not on CD yet) should really get 5 stars. Lots of orchestrated ballads there plus a few outstanding rockers such as ""Rock & Roll Love Letter"" (a top ten hit by the Bay City Rollers).Tim is a talented singer-songwriter which should have been more successful commercially. Unfortunately my collection of his works just stopped at ""White Shadow"" (his 3rd album). I wasn't able to locate any of his latter albums. Just hope I'll come across them in the store again on CD."
5,Thank you Tim Moore,"When I first heard ""Second Avenue"" on the radio in the 1970s, I knew I had to have this album. The record store had to special order it for me. After all these years I can still say that ""Second Avenue,"" sung by Tim Moore, is one of my all time favorite songs."
2,did not work for me,"the cup was very disapointing , my tablet still hardto swallow .I thought this was the answer to my swallowingproblem but it did not help ,I no longer use it ,waste ofmoney"
3,Not for me...,"I had high hopes for this product after years of gagging and sputtering on pills. Unfortunately, this did not work for me. If people who have trouble swallowing pills can be sorted into camps, I'm in the group who fears choking and always seems to catch the pill on the back of my tongue at the last second...water goes down and the pill stays in the back of my mouth. This did not do anything for my problem. I'm giving it 3 stars because I don't think there was anything wrong with the construction or design of the cup. It simply did not work for me. Since I mostly need to take vitamins, I bought a pill crusher instead."
1,Disappointed,"I was so excited when I found this cup online. My granddaughter is having problems swallowing her daily pill and was hoping this would be the answer to our problem. However, it didn't work for her, she still manages to get the pill stuck on her tongue. I will be returning this item. I was also disappointed that I had to go through the seller and not Amazon to return the product. I could not print a return label, had to make my own. I'm concerned that I may not get my refund, time will tell."
4,really helps!,"My son (11) has always had trouble swallowing medications due to a very sensitive gag reflex. Howver, afeter a couple of practices with this, he is taking his pills with no drama or delay. It iw wonderful not to have an argument everytime he needs to take a pill. Thanks."
1,Not for me,"Having recently begun to have difficulty swallowing pills and needing to take more than a few daily, I bought this cup. Like others I, too, found it useless. I have followed the directions carefully, but found that it has never dispensed the pill with water -- the pill just sits inside the spout where it gets water-soaked and begins to disintegrate. This, needless to say, is not the result that I wanted. I would certainly like to know how those who report satisfaction have managed to have the spout release the pill with water so that it could be swallowed. Ah, well, it sounded too good to be true and for me it was. I have better results just remembering to tilt my head back when swallowing a pill."
1,Didnt work for us,"A lot of money for nothing for us. She tried many times to use it, but it just didnt work for her. We are still unsuccessful with getting her to swallow pills."
1,Did not work for my kid.,"Did not work for my kid. If you can't get it down in the first shot, the pill gets wet and then sticks in the spout. Don't recommend."
3,cup,"In theory this should be a great solution, did not work for us. The design of the cup may help others"
2,Didn't work for the pills we have,The pill kept sticking to the sides of the pill chute and wouldn't get into the mouth even when we practicall tipped it upside down. The pill stuck to the sides and didn't work. Even when we wet the pill first it still stuck and all the liquid would go in the mouth but the capsule stayed in the chute. Very disappointing for the price!! I wish I just bought the 4 dollar competitor product instead :(
2,Not working for me...,"I thought this product might help me with swallowing pills. I found that it brought too much water into my mouth at one time. In addition, if you need to take two pills, the second pill will get wet, and it will not move into your mouth (you must dry the cup first). Also thought the product was overpriced."
2,Too much liquid!,I bought this for someone that has a hard time swallowing pills. I was told that it was to hard to use because the spout allows far to much liquid to come in at once. I tried it myself and have to agree.You end up with a mouthful of liquid and the pill you were trying to swallow.Maybe if you can find a way to plug up the spout partway it would work better.
4,A nice second Semiramide,"I find Panni's tempos a bit awkward and slow - especially compared to the fiery bluster of Marin. I also think Marin's set has an all-around more even cast, and that would be my choice recording. I know, I've heard all about La Studer and Larmore's onstage gaffes, but in the studio they were just fine. Gruberova of course is phenomenal in the coloratura, but beyond the breath-taking runs her performance still comes up as bland, the dramatic moments are pallid and unconvincing. She has an easier time portraying fear or outright horror, but I can't buy her threats (especially compared to Studer).Florez fans will want to note that this is already an old recording (though only recently released I believe). So expect a beautiful voice that is a work in progress.In short - if you're only getting one Semiramide, this wouldn't be my choice. I would get the Marin set (most consistent), or the Southerland/Horne for the best Semiramide/Arsace solos and duets."
5,Refreshing,Great book to read when your usual translation feels dry. I have been reading James Moffat's version for about nine months and I am still enjoying it very much.
3,Moffat OK,"The Moffat translation seems to be intact, but the paper used is like photo paper which makes this bible unusually thick and cumbersome. The Spine is too week for the bulk of paper which makes handling the book a clumsy process. I suppose for the relatively low cost one might consider this acceptable in today's market, but now you are at least forewarned."
2,Waste of money,I wanted to learn about Hepatitis B..not what this man ate on a daily basis. Did not find the book helpful at all.
2,Informative,"This book was very informative, not only in answering questions about Hepatitis B but also in describing the various other forms of the Hepatitis virus (A,C,D,& E). The book outlines common questions and answers reqarding Hepatitis B and describes the author's cure which carries a warning and disclaimer regarding the use of the combination of Interferon and Ribavirin (not sold in the US). I found most curious the author's statement on pages 11-12, ""I started to pray very hard for God to help me make the best decision. I went with my instincts because that was all that I had left to rely on."" If I could ask the author one question, I would ask him this. While he was praying, why didn't he just ask Him...""for healing""? (Isaiah 53:5)"
4,Reliable,"Together with its companion ""Mexico West Traveller Map"" this map is one of the best maps available for Mexico. Easily legible design, important tourist information (many sights shown, including the always searched-for gas stations). A reliable map for those planning to drive in Mexico."
1,worx 24 volt 2-1 cordless trimmer,"Very disappointed battery last 20 minutes if lucky, had to manually pull string out. This might be fine for a very small yard. I like how they say 2 football fields. The best part is how they stick it to you when you return it, $45.00 to return it for me. Thats after a 40 minute wait on the phone to get a return number and,then they tell me it will take 3 days to email they label to me. Please read the reviews before you buy one. The only good thing I could say it was light weight."
2,Not worth it,"If you have a small yard with light edging, this product may be okay. We don't have a large yard, but we do have a fence in our backyard. This trimmer finishes a small amount trimming in the front but it doesn't even get 1/3 of the yard done in the back before the battery dies. With the climate where we live, we get weeds that spring up pretty quickly and this trimmer just doesn't have the oomph to get those in one pass. It takes several passes to cut some of the larger weeds.Basically, this trimmer just doesn't have the battery life or the power to do a good job. Next time, I'm going to spend more money for a more quality product."
2,no where near the power of gas models,"Just got my WORX WG150. I would suggest if there is anyway you can, test this weedeater before buying it. With single string and smaller string than is used on most gas models I found edging unacceptable. After about 20 minutes or less the battery has power but not enough to cut the grass but to fully discharge the battery you have to hold the switch in the on position for about another 10 minutes. The only positive thing I can think of is I was able to listen to my talk radio station with headset while operating the weedeater."
2,Depends on your Grass,"The Worx trimmer is engineered well as far as ease of use, charging and storing. However, it does not generate enough cutting force for the typical grass of the South, St. Augustine. Don't bother buying this product if you have tougher grass, it will just push it around."
3,Good Product,Weed wacker was good but the battery that came with it sucked. One season for a $40.00 battery isn't getting it.
4,Nice work horse for small jobs,Love the battery power and this is a very easy to use product. Only thing I would change is make the extension longer for taller people.
3,Workx Works,"I have an easier time cutting the lawn, especially since my grass has patches, (some died) so it's not worth lugging the heavy lawn mower up my steps plus it's heavy for a 5'3"" woman like me to push. the model I bought is not the elite/improved model and I wish it came with more line trimm, but overall alot easier to cut the lawn."
1,Worst buy ever!,I bought this trimmer after seeing the infomercial. I have never been more frustrated with anything! The battery power is poor and has to be charged before every use even if you did not use the full battery the previous time. The line breaks all the time. I did not receive a lifetime supply of cord and when I called they charged me for extra spools. The customer service was poor and after hearing my complaints they did not offer any resolutions. This has been a total waste of money and I am having to buy a new trimmer. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!
2,"Nice idea, but for light work and easy jobs only, like edging your sidewalk.","The Worx GT WG150 is not for big jobs, or heavy cutting of weeds. I like the portability, and the battery life is reasonable, but only works for smaller trimming jobs that are ""easy"". Was hoping to replace my electric corded trimmer, am having to buy a larger one. Luckily the price point was such, that I don't feel really taken for the lack of performance, I got what I paid for."
4,Good Product,"We bought this originally in 2007 and it made a funny noise and stopped working after 5 years so we bought another one to replace it. Yes the battery is a problem as everyone has written. We did buy a second battery a couple years ago so now we have 3 batteries and 2 charges. We can charge 2 at once, take 1 and use it for about 20 mins. Put the 3rd one on and use the 2nd one for about 20 mins. They take about 2 hours to charge for each one so we work it out. The yard in total time is about 60 minutes so we make it work with the rotation of the batteries. We haven't been too pleased with the edger so this year we bought a B & D edger and we really like it. It was a good price on Amazon like the Workx was a good price too."
2,Not What I Expected,"Product does not work as advertised. The battery is short lived, and it has a hard time trimming the weeds with such a thin line. Not satisfied with this product at all. I have an electric trimmer that works 10x better than this product."
2,heart of the system (battery) very poor,"The NiCon battery has low power and poor life. I have had my edger for two years now. The first year it worked great, at the end of the summer I drained the battery and set it aside. The following summer I recharged it and went out to use it, I barely have enough power to get my trimming done let alone the edging. In order to use it again I have to clamp the handle down and completely drain the battery (not safe). Then recharge the battery for 24 hours. The Nicon battery in short makes the system completely none usable.Pros:Great ergonomicsFor the 10-20 minutes I have power it does everything I could ever need it for.Cons:POOR battery lifeNeeds to be completely drained to make it functionI consider the battery the heart of the system; poor heart poor system. Its like having a laptop that has to be plugged in to work."
1,Worthless,"No power at all, Very poor performer, They talked me into buying a second battery and now I know why, it runs low on power within 10 minutes.The telescoping shaft is a nice feature but only if you are 4'7"" is it of any use. Fully extended it is too short for the average person.I am waiting a refund!B&D; grasshog is a much better unit, I had my last one for 4 years before I needed to replace it and then late one night, I got sucked into the worx infomercial."
3,Replacement spools detract,"The trimmer pretty much works as advertised on TV. However, the spools containing the trimmer line are too small and are a rip-off. I used the trimmer twice for about 20 minutes each time and the spool that came with the unit ran out of string! I thought that was ridiculous until I determined the reason. The company has a so-called ""free replacement for life"" program. This is BS. They want almost $9 for ""shipping and handling"" for six replacement spools. If USPS is $2.71 to ship that leaave $1.00 of revenue for each spool. At a manufacturing cost of about $.25 they realize a gross profit of $.75 on each spool. If you need a replacement after every two uses, they are going to get a lot of replacement revenue for each unit sold. Kind of like the HP toner or Gillette razor model. Sell the box at break even and make a bundle on the toner or blades. On retrospect, I would probably get the trimmer with the largest possible spool."
2,Small Jobs only!,"What was Popular Mechanics thinking when they recomended this product. I would only recomend this for small jobs only. I have 2100 sq. ft. of lawn. The battery is adequate. The worx is light and easy to use. However, it is not a good trimmer/edger. I have used a gas trimmer for years and thought this would be a great tool to replace my old one with. What a mistake. You are constantly having to feed line if you want a close cut, because it just wont cut. It has a metal guide on the front of it that is more of a hinderance than guide. And as for using it as an edger, if your taller than 6 ft. be prepared to do alot of stooping. This product is worthless as your main trimmer/edger."
2,not all that strudy,"I purchased one of these because it sounded good on the tv ad. Free line for life, sounds great. The length of the handle, after it is extended out, was still very short and uncomfortable to use. The actual edging of the grass took forever. The battery was charged for several days before use but does really last that long. I sent it back and went back to using the a gas powered edger."
4,flexible tool,"The trimmer has all the flexibility it advertises. The battery is easy to get on/off. I think the ultimate power is a bit lacking, but overall it is very easy to use and adjust."
2,Great Concept - Poor Performance,"Nice Product. Edge cutis beautiful if your grass has already been trimmed by a more powerful trimmer. Thus it's not so good on the power side because it does not perform well on serious trimming duties. Would be an excellent product if it had 3 simple things: 1) A 36 Volt Battery for POWER. 2). Real wheels that were made of high grade rubber instead of cheap plastic. Also if it incorporated ball bearing wheels into its design the wheels would not bind easily. 3). The telescoping shaft desperately needs to be at least a foot longer. Then this product would really be ready for the everyday home owner. As it is now, it's for some little old lady who wants to tiddy up a bit. Worx Mfg, if you are reading this, please take this review to heart. You have a great concept, but in practice it truly is lacking."
1,"Weak performance, weak customer service","This trimmer edger is weak, it bogs down too easily. The only benefit is that it is cordless. We had to get our gas powered trimmer to do the real work. We ordered two batteries initially, the second of which never came. We called 3 times and were forced to leave messages. We emailed 3 times as well with an automated response telling us we would be contacted within 24-48 hours. None of our emails were returned, nor were the messages that were left. Finally got through where I learned that emails and voicemails are sent to an unmonitored box in their ""corporate office"". Upon that news, instead of asking for our second battery to be sent, I cancelled the order immediately. That best money I spent was the ink I wrote my return confirmation with. Do NOT buy."
1,Be very afraid,"OK so when I first received this ""trimmer"" the battery would last about twenty minutes. It would take three charges just to edge my relatively small yard.Just as I was about to give up and return it, their website stated that certain batteries were defective and could be replaced. Mine was one of them and I filled out the information on their website. Got a new battery but paid $7 for the shipping (how stupid was I?). New battery wasn't any better. Sent everything back directly to Worx over two months ago (paid another $16 for shipping)and I have not heard anything from these people.Bought a Ryobi and it works great!"
2,Worx GT Grass trimmer,"Trimmer is light weight and easy to manage. Like many battery operated device, it looses power so fast. It took me longer to trim my small lawn using it than a conventional gas one. Thank You for letting me try the device."
1,poor power source,Have had this trimmer for a year. Its battery is undersized. You get 15 min at best. The line doesn't self feed and wraps around the shaft and is difficult to unwrap. Looks better on tv than the real world operation.
1,Not Recommended=String Trimmer is a Wimpy Performer!!!,"Don't waste your money = go corded or gas only, unless all you have to trim is 10 - 30 feet of golf course quality short grass... Go to a Menards or Home Depot or another ""brick & mortar"" store so you can get some customer service. I emailed them about their poor performance and poor battery life on the string trimmer and got no response. One of the largest wastes of money in my lifetime. The blower and trimmer are ok, but the string trimmer is a joke!Be prepared to buy batteries - that are very expensive - every year. The string trimmer is for very small jobs - contractors: Don't buy this trimmer = you'll never get the job done in time!!! I have three houses/yards to trim and went back to my gas trimmer that makes short work of it all !!! Larry"
1,great concept poor execution,I bought this at costco because of the t.v. infomercial and my gas trimmer was waering out. When it arrived I was excited to have a new tool. It was very easy to put together charging the battery took 1+ hour not the 30 minutes as described. I went to work and in about 20 minutes the battery died. I charged it again and this time it took almost 2 hours. I went back to work and in under 30 minutes the battery died again. My very small yard was not even half done.
2,Mediocre,"The product works well as long as you don't have think grass or any kind of thick weed to cut through. I like the design and all the angles it rotates is very helpful and convent. If your yard is thin grass than this is a great choice, if you have think grass, weeds, or runners to edge, look elsewhere. This trimmer/edger will not cut through anything thick."
2,15 minutes and DONE,I bought this thinking the battery would save on gas and time.... I was wrong*Battery dies after 15 minutes (re-charge 2 hours) another 15 minutes ugh...3 charges per use not acceptable*Poor on edging must go over 2 or 3 times for clean edge*Poor height adjustments for anyone over 5 feet tallDon't waste your time unless you only have a 20x20 area to do
4,Worx trimmer,"Nice business!, everything came at time, even sooner. And just as describe. It would be great if you have more bunddels on lawn and garden."
2,Not how it's advertised,"Watching the commercials on TV this trimmer looks great. My wife wanted one that was lighter than my ECHO so I ordered it for her. With a full charge it will in fact trim grass. that's about it. if you get into any weeds it will leave most of them. I did order an additional battery which was a smart choice since the battery only last about 5 minutes with any power. After that it even has trouble with grass. In conclusion, this is great for a tiny yard with a short sidewalk and a few shrubs. Anymore, stick with the power machines."
5,Love it,I can't use a gas trimmer becouse they are too heavy. I was buying cheap electric weed eaters and I hated th cord and not being able to go to the end of my property. (I live on an acre) this weed eater is not real powerful but it's great for me! I have MS so I don't need it to last too long but I can do over half of my front yard before the battery dies!
1,Poor Battery,"Battery charged for 3 days, then only lasted 15 minutes when used. I would not recommend this item, unless you want to keep charging it."
2,Cordless just doesn't have enough power,"I wanted to like this trimmer, I really did. As a woman, it is so difficult to manage a gas-powered trimmer. When I saw the ""before"" and ""after"" photos listed here, I decided to write a review. It would probably take me an hour to get the effect shown in these photos! If you have St. Augustine grass, you have to move the trimmer about as slow as a snail in order to cut it. And even with a small yard, the battery will wear out before you finish.My take on this trimmer is that it is better than nothing. It works better than the gas trimmer I have hanging in the garage that will not start at all."
2,Never Again,"I had hoped for end of gas powered trimmers in my life, but not to be! First year it was OK, next year weak, now no action at all. Won't even cut thin grass. Do I want to spend 100 bucks each year on batteries that crap out after one summer's use and refuse to power up fully? This thing is going OUT in the can. I won't fall for the commercials any more for new untested stuff like this. I see there are now propane powered trimmers that you can buy only on-line, but nobody has them and no repair shops for them anywhere. Buy something with no service anywhere? Nope, I won't fall for this again. Going back to gas power but this time with 4 stroke no-mix engine. Even though Craftsman is medium grade quality they offer a 3 year end to end warranty for only 49.99. So for three years I can get no-question replacement for the price of ONE battery from Worx. A no-brainer decision now!--Excelsior!"
3,"it is ok, that it!!","The product is too weak to do more than maintain the landscape. If you are using it to clear the growth after the winter, you will find it is too soft.I had to revert back to my gas trimmer to clear the winter growth and I suppose will use this to maintain the edge.Not what was promised on TV ads."
3,Worx 18v cordless grass trimmer,"trimmer has nice features, too bad the battery does not stay charged as long as the manufacturer states."
1,Think twice and hard,After using my edger and blower for 1/2 season and purchasing an extra battery for backup I am completely dissapointed with the lack of power in either unit. I had to replace the battery charger this spring and now neither battery will hold a charge. The unit is good for very small areas but the lack of battery life makes it useless.
5,a great work tool,"I own this and think it's the cat meow. It makes outside work much easier and faster and it edges just wonderfully. The best part is - no cords to fuss with - it's all on a battery that lasts for longer than the job takes. Your price is $25 off the infommercial. So, I highly recommend it."
1,cordless no-go,They say you get what you pay for!!!!! First and last time I buy a Work GT brand.After one use its no good. The replacement spool wont stay in and keeps popping out coming unwind....
2,"Great Idea, But Weak Execution","The title pretty much says it all. The device when fully charged is fairly weak; it will not cut through thick grass or weeds. The commercial was very exaggerated. Worse of all, like others that bought this trimmer, after about a year the battery died. The only good thing about this trimmer is the tilting head, that's it.For the price of this thing, go get two gas trimmers."
2,just a toy,"i was hoping for the best ,but these worx is a toy at best, i should of know better.maybe if you have a very small lawn."
4,I LOVE IT!!!!!,"i have had this trimmer/edger for 2 years. i have about a half an acre. i was reading some of the other reviews and found the same thing over and over. the spool. i have no problem with the spool, because i wrap my own. the spool you get from worx ar almost laughable. beside the line you get it is a good machine. i wouldn't keep your batteries on the charger all the time because they heat up. i read a review that some lady's battery and charger blew up. that is why i wouldn't leave the battery on the charger all the time. all in all it's a good trimmer and edger. i use it to edge too. the beginning of each year so far the first edge takes a little longer everyone after that is great. the light weight is great and i love it!!!!!! it is worth every penny."
4,Just right for me,"I was a little apprehensive about purchasing the worx after reading the negative reviews, but decided to give it a try anyway. So glad I did. For what I use it for it works perfectly for me. I needed a small lightweight trimmer without having to use an electric cord. I can get thru my whole yard without needing to recharge the battery. I tried it in some thicker weeds and it wasn't up for that, but I just needed it for grass. If you are looking for something to do heavy duty weeds, this wouldn't be the machine. But like I said, it is perfect for me."
1,WORX cordless trimmer,"Theoretically a very good idea. In practice, a dud!! Not near enough power, the parts did not fit together well, probably good for only one use. Do NOT purchase one of these. I used mine once and will discard as it is just awful!!!"
1,A piece of worthless junk!,"I wish I had read more reviews before buying this worthless tool. I wish I had mailed it back right away. But by the time I had used it, it was to late to send it back. And (from where I live) returning large items like this is such an ordeal. I would gladly give it away, but I am sure no one wants it?It is worthless with NO POWER AT ALL! It has been thrown off in a corner in the garage (deemed useless) Don't waste your money on this expensive piece of junk! I will NEVER! I repeat NEVER! purchase anything from this company again!!!I'm thinking on a scale of 1-10 that one is the lowest score I can give it."
3,Does small jobs,"Seems to work ok, but have never had it auto-feed as claimed. But it is light and easy to manual feed. If you have a small yard it should last long enough before recharging."
1,Waste of money,"Bought it for my husband to make gardening easier,he says it is not sturdy,not powerful enough. Passed it on to my son who has a postage stamp yard,he hated it.So we went and bought one that is over 300 dollars,and now the worx is sitting in the corner collecting cob web,too much trouble to return. A lesson learned,always consult with the gardener before buying any tools that is too good to be true stuff on TV.To rate this product it really does not deserve any stars but this is required."
2,Worx GT Review,"After seeing the infomercial for Worx GT, I couldn't wait to order it. I already own the cordless Black and Decker String Trimmer, but the edger feature on the Worx appeared to be better. Sadly, I am very disappointed. Like the Black and Decker, the string doesn't feed out easily. Plus, it doesn't have near the power of the Black and Decker. I tried to use it to edge the ivy that grows into my driveway and the Worx didn't have enough power to cut the ivy off. When I use the standard position to cut grass around the edge of the patio, I have to keep going over the same spot to get it to cut. The one nice thing about the Worx is the flexible handle positions. If I had it to do again, I would not spend my money."
1,Total trash,"I cannot beleive I fell for this piece of junk. I tried to cancel after reading reveiws, But was told they could not find my information about my order, and told me to call back in 24 - 48 hrs. the next day i called they had took the money and the junx gt was shipped. kinda shady. any way tried it out and all the nightmare reveiws came true. dont waste your time or money on this junk."
1,worx gt no work,"Bought 24V model, between shipping and the upgarde over $150.00. Worked one time and battery never recharged. Went through a few replacement chargers and batteries but none ever wokred. Sent back for refund, waiting to get money."
1,Weak and Slow,"I have a tiny backyard, and this cordless trimmer seemed like the perfect thing to get all the corners and edges done quickly. Unfortunately, I learned that the battery runs low so quickly that it took me three full battery charges to complete the trimming and edging. Since it takes up to three hours to charge the battery I figured out I could actually get it done faster with a pair of scissors and a gardening trowel - not the solution I was looking for. It can only hold up to the thinnest weeds. Anything substantial stops it dead in its tracks. Don't waste your money on this one."
2,Lacks power,"The Worx GT is a novel design that is very easy to operate. I really like not having to pull along an extension cord or worry about gas and oil. BUT, and this is a big but, this trimmer offers precious little power. It cannot handle the thinnest bits of grass, and don't even attempt to use it on strong weeds. I would recommend sticking with a gas-powered or electric cord model."
2,"More Power, Please",This product is very well constructed and the concept is good BUT it lacks power to do the job! Found it very frustrating to not be able to do what I wanted it to do which was trim a normal landscaped yard.
1,Over-hyped trimmer,"I purchased this product relying on the advertised presentation. Boy, was I taken! One word describes this product: Underpowered. I'll go back to dragging a cord for a while until I first handedly experience an efficient cordless.Richard Knowles, Pensacola, Fl."
1,poor edger/trimmer,"the worx gt is lightweight and that is the only plus. The egder doesn't cut thick grass or weeds. it is a poor edger and trimmer. the trimmer doesn't cut the grass around the foundation of my house. The line doesn't auto shoot like the company describes. The line cuts and goes inside of the machine and you have to flip the machine, open it up and pull the strand out (which is hard to pull out) then manually thread it. The line cut two times in four minutes after I took the time to rethread it. I am returning this thing today. this item is only good if you have thin, soft grass, and no"
1,Wrokx GT - Fails really fails!,"WORX GT WG150 10-Inch 18-Volt 2-In-1 Cordless Electric Grass Trimmer/EdgerI bought this at the beginning of the summer so that I could get rid of the cords following me around the yard. What a disappointment! The battery doesn't even hold a charge to get through on side of my front walk and I don't live on a football field! NO POWER to cut through thick growth in corners. I have never felt so taken advantage of. ""Truth in Advertisement"" is not part of this Company's Mission Statement. This product is a shear waste of money."
1,"Don't buy, piece of junk & customer service stinks!","Before buying this call the 800 number and see how long it takes to get through. Go online and write anything on their response page and see how long it takes to call (if you get one). We have had our weed eater for a month and it has worked for less than 20 minutes. We found that the battery doesn't work. We immediately called and they sent us another battery (it took 2 weeks.) It was the wrong model number, wrong battery. I called back and finally got through, the customer service rep told me another one was ordered and was on its way. I recently called b/c I got no confirmation email and it had never been ordered. As far as I am concerned, I own a piece of junk. It has not worked enough to finish my front yard. The company stinks. DON'T BUY!!! Be warned."
1,"Stay away, Worx's will not work with you on battery issue!","Battery and Worx are worthless. No help! My unit is only 2 months old! Battery will not charge. It now over heats(blinking red light) so it won't continue to charge after 5 minutes in the charger. Can't get response from the Co. They have not helped others from what I have read. They must know about the negative commets and problems with the battery, and continue to advertise and sell them. Go to other on-line retailers and the ""Q"" tv retailer and read all those reviews as well. Everyone has the same thing to say."
2,Battery is worthless,"The features of the cordless trimmer/edger are great. Love how lightweight it is. However, it worked great the first time. I even bought an extra battery with the original purchase. After 3 times the battery would not hold a charge for more than 10 minutes. Thought the battery was defective. Then the other battery did the same thing. Thought it may be the charger that was defective. However, I read other reviews on this product and most state that the batteries do not hold a charge. Therefore I will have to return. It is a shame they cannot get a battery that can hold a charge. But cannot use the product without a working battery."
2,"Weak, underpowerd and doesn'r last long","This trimmer is not worth the money. The motor is weak, the battery life between charges in about 10 minutes then you have to charge it for an hour if you can get the charger to reset and actually charge. If you have more than 1/4 acre lot this little thing will not help you. The one nice thing I can say is that the changover from trimmer to edger is easy."
2,Not powerful enough for the average yard,I purchased this because it looked wonderful on the tv demonstration. It seemed like it would be more convenient than my Black & Decker 18 volt cordless. WRONG!!!! The B & D had MUCH more power and works much better for me. The battery on the WORX does last a long time but that is the only benefit I found. I loaned it to my neighbor when her trimmer went out and she didn't like it either. I wish I hadn't wasted my money!
1,Terrible,"I ordered the weed eater\edger, hedge trimmer, and blower.I did not take the option to pay more for a faster delivery. I tried to cancel the order less than 24 hours later (buyers remorse) but it had already been shipped. Paying more for faster delivery just seems to be a way to try to get more money out of the buyer.When I received the order I tried the weed eater\edger and the blower. The trimmer was under powered but was OK for light work. The edger is the weed eater turned on its side. There was not enough power to properly do any real edging. The blower did not have nearly enough power.I paid $36.00 to return the order. After 20 days my account was credited for $25.00 less than what I had paid. I guess this was a restocking fee. Ordering from WORX was a very expensive mistake."
2,Weak,"Very little power, short cutting area. However it is very convenient if your cutting very thin grass."
2,Worx GT,"Great for trimming, but not powerful enough for edging. We had to go over the grass 3 or 4 times to get a clean cut.Worx GT 10-Inch 18-Volt Cordless Electric String Trimmer/Edger #WG150"
1,worx trimmer review,I was not happy with this product. The battery only lasted 1/2 a season. I called the service department to make sure I was using the battery properly. The replacement battery is $40.
1,very disappoited,I brought this trimmer 2 years ago it is worthless battery does hold a charge I would never recommond it its junk
3,Home Owner,"The system is light and easy to use. But the battery does not last long as stated on TV (3-times around a foot ball field) and your Web site.After edging the yard, the motor seem very slow and run very hot when I tried to cut around the trees and fence.I may have gotten the wrong model number. Because the one I saw on TV had a smaller square battery that attached directly to the Worxs. The one I have has a long steam type battery that attached inside the Worx's handle.I'm returning this one and will get the other model and see how it will work.Will let you know soon. Stan Neal"
2,WORX GT,THE BATTERY ON THIS ITEM IS BAD. YOU HAVE TO CHARGE IT 2 DAYS FOR IT TOO WORK RIGHT WHEN I GOT IT THE PRODUCT SHOULD HAVE WORKED OR STATED ABOUT THE CHARGE.
5,Electric Grass Trimmer,Husband loved this! In Jamaica they use the grass trimmer instead of lawn mowers. Might have to get a new one once he gets to America!
3,Battery Life is short!,"I love the weight of this unit and the concept, however I have gone through alot of batteries! Batteries aren't cheap either!!! Each battery will operate the machine for about 10 minutes and then it needs charging. This works great for about a month and then it won't charge completely anymore. This machine is costing me too much money, I have since bought another brand!"
1,Townhouse Dweller,"If you live in a townhouse or condo with very little grass to cut, this is fine. If you have an actual YARD, don't waste your money buying this. It only has a good 12 minutes of decent power per charge . . . tops. Work quickly or buy an extra charger; or you'll run out of ""juice"". And if you're going to need an extra charger, just throw in the towel already and buy that gas or electric trimmer."
3,grass trimmer,"The grass trimmer is not very powerful.. I use my old gas one instead, it does a much nicer job"
3,Not very strong.,I like it Do not get me wrong It served its purpose But if you have thicker grass or weeds like I had in some places Then you will still have to get down with a knife and loosen things up. I only really use it because I have an irrational fear of weed whackers and my husband gets deployed a lot.
2,Worx review,"No problem with battery power or endurance. Light and eazy to handle. I did find that the cutting string did not auto extend on occasion. Difficult to accuately guide the the cutting string to the exact area I wanted to trim causing the cutting area to be gapped and uneven. Overall, would not have purchased the trimmer. I'm back to using my old gas trimmer."
3,Owned this for 3 years,"I bought this weed trimmer/hedge trimmer combo from the infomercial on tv - works fine for light duty - the company is great at sending replacement spools at no charge - with exception of shipping and handling. Battery only good for 30 mins so nice to have extras. I would rather have an electric one though, which I am shopping for now."
1,this is a total piece of s***,This trimmer has no power except to trim fuzz off a peach. It feels great and looks good but does not have enough power to blow dust off your window sill. I called the customer help line and had to wait for 44 callers ahead of me to ask for a refund mailing label. This is a total piece of s***.
2,Worx GT WG150 Cordless Trimmer,Very disappointing!!!!! The line wears out fast and won't cut heavier weeds.If you have a small yard with no weeds this may work fine for you.A gas trimmeris much faster and does a better job.My advice...Don't get rid of your gastrimmer !!!!!!!
1,GREAT and OVERWHELMING DISAPPOINTMENT,"My wife ordered this trimmer/edger for me as a father's day gift. When we received the product in the mail, we were very please. The GREAT and OVERWHELMING DISAPPOINTMENT came when we tried to actually use the trimmer/Edger, we realized then and there that this thing is simply not able to do neither the trimming nor the edging effectively. After we had followed the instructions, and charged the battery pack overnight, the next day we tried it in our driveway; a fairly small area, after 45min of frustration we had to give up. The results left our lawn looking uneven. To be generous, I'll say that the trimmer produced mediocre results, and is not effective at all as an edger. Anything but this product!"
2,GT Worx isn't the worst,"I bought the GT Worx in July 2008 and think it's an okay product.The automatic line has not worked from day one. The line cutter is a little far from the protectant shield thus is too close to the line feeder, so the line doesn't get as long as other eaters.The flower guard is sorta in the way too so it always seems like the line isn't long enough to cut weeds. Since the auto line feeder hasn't worked, whenever I hear a high pitch I need to stop, flip over the eater, and press the button to let more line out...something Robyn Harttl promised I'd never have to do again.It is super light and the battery power seems better than I thought it'd be.Maybe my weeds are super powered because the GT Worx couldn't slay my yard. I think it would work better for brand new, fragile yards.Good luck!Still at it,R.Stark in Oregon"
4,Worx Cordless Electric String Trimmer,"It is very light and easy to use. It is a little bit underpowered in my opinion, but it does do a reasonably good job on grass and weeds. The battery holds its charge pretty well and recharges quickly. Overall I would recommend this product to others."
4,I've had it over a year now,"Last season I would have rated it one star due to ongoing battery problems. I took another shot this spring and called to have the battery replaced. I was informed the old batteries were produced by another manufacturer and did not stop charging when overheated. They have new batteries from another company and so far, it has charged perfectly the 10 times I've used it.As for performance, it will do very well on small to medium sized lots. I have an above average lot (half acre) and the battery holds out fine. If you have close to an acre or more, get two batteries or buy a gas trimmer. But, this is much more convenient than a gas trimmer since it's as easy as popping the battery in and out. Takes several hours to charge it up. Power is pretty good unless you're trying to clear out an overgrown area. But for the trimming most people have, it is more than sufficient. I have grown to really like this trimmer and have found the customer service to be responsive."
1,battery is garbage,"I bought this last year and used it once, it was excellent. I put it away for the winter, charged the battery and went to use it. It ran for 20 seconds and died. I tried charging it, got the dredded flashing red. Battery is garbage after 1 use."
1,Crap,"This is the worst piece of crap I have ever seen.... Don't believe everything you see on TV, I regret buying it. The string is so short and the power that comes from it is poor. The battery don't last as long as they said... it takes five minutes to cut three feet of my grass edges. Don't buy it, please! It's junk."
3,It does the job but....,"This items is a good ""detailing"" tool, though is a little weak for large yards and tough grass. I use my regular gas trimmer to clear tall grass and large areas due to the longer line. I use this product where a finish is needed. I will recommend buying a second battery to finish the job without waiting to recharge."
1,disappointed,"I ordered the grass trimmer. I used it the first day. When I put the battery to charge It did not turn red.I had to wait another week for the a new charger and It did not work either. I thought now it's the battery. They said no, it's the charger. How lucky am I to get 2 bad chargers... I am sending it back, Am out $ 60.OO, because of the shipping cost and I have nothing to show for my money. With the money I spent on shippingI could have brought an electric one. They claim the spools are free but only send 2, now you have to pay shipping for the other ""free"" ones. Don't buy..."
1,Weak motor and batteries not covered by warranty,"I wouldn't buy this. The motor is weak AND the battery will not charge after two uses. Called customer support and they told me that batteries are NOT COVERED under the ""warranty"". Save your money and your blood pressure and go elsewhere."
1,Completly dissapoiting,"I had seen the infomercials for this product. I wanted something that my wife and kids could use to help out with the lawn, and this looked perfect. However, it was completely dissapointing. It had no power, the cord did not seem to feed properly, it would not edge neatly as shown.I returned it, and will probably replace with a gas powered unit again."
2,Girlyman trimmer,"Nice idea, but poor in execution. The trimmer works well on light grass, but is bogged down by weeds. The trim string is in a small roll, and while it is easy to change, it lasts about five minutes and costs $5 ea to replace. My advice: suck it up and buy a gas trimmer."
1,Completely unacceptable.,"Painfully weak. Takes 4 or 5 passes to do the work normally done in one pass. Takes forever. Line often slips back into spool and can't be retrieved without disassembling it. Useful charge lasts less than 30 minutes and weakens slowly. Will not recharge, unless fully discharged, which means you have to hold it on forever while it slowly grinds to a halt (the manual even suggests that!). Good idea, but simply does not work. More of a toy than a tool. I'm seeking a full refund."
3,Power,The unit is very handy and well constructed but it is not quite powerful enough. 24-volt would have been better.
3,Very light duty,In the begining it would break the cutting lines as soon as I started using it. After a few calls to the factory they sent some upgraded lines at no charge. Now it works better. Very light duty.
2,Not all pieces included when purchased on Amazon,"The as seen on TV commercial for this item shows that it includes a hanging bracket, it also mentions lifetime free replacement trimmer cord. The box the item came in also mentions the hanging bracket but according to the website for the product, neither are included when purchasedon Amazon. If I had know that I would NOT have purchased it via Amazon but used the items website for ordering. I suggest people look carefully before purchasing items on Amazon as it appears they are NOT all created equal!"
1,Disappointed,Very poor battery life on two batteries. It works okay as an edger but not well as a weed eater. I was very disappointed in my purchase. It was a waste of money.
2,Work GT WG150 Review,"It was difficult for the user to evenly guide the unit in the edging mode along the sidewalk/driveway. The plastic wheel could be wider to provide stability. Also, if the unit had an edger guide to keep the unit moving in a straight even motion. I returned the unit and purchased another piece of equipment"
1,wasted energy (electric),"The battery won""t take a charge hot or cold! After a very short operating period the battery is run down and hot.In order to complete a small job in a reasonable period of time, I put it in the refrigerator while doing other chores.After a short period of time, the battery would not recharge. I believe the twice around the football field was a fraud!Rating .6 (downgraded from 1}"
1,Poor Battery Quality,I just contacted customer service because my battery won't hold a charge. There is a two year warranty on the product and a one year warranty on the battery. I purchased this in 2010 and am not a person that mows twice a week. This is dissapointing because I actually like the product itself. But it will cost $67 to replace the battery which makes no sense at all. Maybe the newer versions are better but please beware that the original version and customer service are less than ideal. Not sure why you warranty a product for two years but only the battery for one.
4,Good,"Overall, very good. Only two problems, have trouble removeing the battery to recharge it (don't have enough muscle, I guess) and the cord has broken twice and then you can't find an end to unwind it.I am pleased the battery recharges quickly compared to my last brand."
1,"Poor Quality, Dead Battery, No Service Response","Bought it in April 2010, Battery died in July. Emailed customer service twice, - no response. Tried to contact customer service by phone twice - ended up in automated response doom loop. In addition, the plastic guard kept falling off, creating an obvious hazard and accelerating the consumption of the nylon string. Bottom line, do not waste your money and time and avoid putting your health at risk with Worx poor quality cordless electric trimmer/edger and hard to get ""customer service""."
1,DONT WORK,"THIS MACHINE DON'T RUN LONE ENOUGH TO GET ANYTHING DONE. WHEN IT IS RUNNING IT DOES NOT CUT THE GRASS IN ONE PASS. AUTO FEED FAIL TO FEED LINE AND WHEN DOES, IT EMPTY THE SPOOL, CUT ENTIRE SPOOL INTO LITTLE PIECES, REPLACE SPOOL TWO TIME."
2,Under Powered For Florida,"I live in South Florida and found that the novelty of an electric edger and weed wacker didn't work out. Our grass down here is too thick and not like the northern grass, very tough to cut. Weed wacking was OK but Edging feel short by a mile. If you live in Florida and know what I am talking about this product is not for you."
1,No Customer Service,Don't buy anything from WORKX direct or by any of their resellers because they will not provide any customer service - period. I had a battery that just would not hold a charge. I wrote various e-mails asking to return the defective battery and asking them to replace it. Not even a response. Nothing. If you have any issues with their products you are out of luck.
3,works OK,"Works OK, The wheels for edger are junk they do not roll smoothly. The auto line feed is not auto at all"
3,too weak,"I found the unit is only good for very small areas and the charge is minimal at best, works ok for only abou 5 min and then has no power left to continue."
2,OK,"The auto feed doesn't work like a good old bump feed unit. It is not worth the $100 bill, more like $50."
1,bad battery -worse customer service,"The battery is weak and lasted less than a year. Trying to get another one from Worx customer service has been an unbelievable and terrible experience. Is has taken 6 weeks and still don't have a replacement. Do not buy one of these units. We bought the trimmer, blower and hedge clippers and am sorry on each."
1,Not the one on TV,"This one has a different battery that is on the handle. The one on TV is a flat battery that is sort of in the middle of the unit.This one makes the handle heavier and makes the unit fall over when you just lean it against anything.It is not as ""great"" as the ads say, and that's very disappointing."
1,Doesn't cut - even simple grass,"I have had this unit for years. I charged up the battery overnight and the next morning was ready to go and it did not cut anything. I switched out the battery thinking maybe the 1st battery just wasn't working strong enough to cut and with the 2nd battery it cut for about a minute then nothing. I'm talking simple grass. I have grabbed it a few times since then thinking, ""OK this time it is going to work"" and nothing. It came with lifetime supply of cutting cord and now I know why, I will never use the 1st spool that came with the trimmer. Worthless! Just taking up space in my garage!"
1,"Terrible product, worse customer service","This is the worst money I have spent in a long time. The trimmer cannot handle trimming, the edger function does not edge, the battery lasted 10 minutes and then failed to recharge at all. Customer service told me to rewind the spools. Hello! One of the ""great"" features was that you didn't have to put string on any more! A refund was refused and they are sending me a new battery. Why? I still have to go behind it with my old gas trimmer and gas edger! Don't waste your money."
2,Under powered tool,"I purchased this item to reduce time it took to trim, it actually increased my time it took do to a lack of power. Yes it works but I can't move as quickly as with my gas trimmer. I bought it for the angles it could quickly adjust too it does that. But I can't move along with any speed."
2,Reviewing the WORX GT - 18- volt cordless line trimmer,"Don't understand the product link? The Worx GT battery only last 20 min. On a full charge. It is not powerfull enough.The battery takes 6 hours to charge. It sends to much line out, then the wire winds arthe trimmer needs to be re- thought out. It needs far more power. Thank you: Bryan Miles............................................................"
1,Piece of Junk,"Worked great the first 5 times. Then the battery would no longer charge. I followed the charging instructions to the letter. Piece of junk, a new battery costs almost as much as a new trimmer. I will go with a gas trimmer in the future."
3,Okay for a cordless,"Well, this works great but the battery life seems to be getting shorter right away.The commercial shows trimming a football field 2 times with no problem, I have used it to trim a 50 X 70 yard, the garden for the same & its seems to slow down, had to recharge to use it for the second yard, not really as big as 1 football field.. Well cordless is cordless.."
1,save your money,"i have 2 of these, one for work and one at home, i've never been able to complete weed trimming at either place before the battery dies,dissapointed and buying an electric trimmer to replace both"
1,Not worth spending your money on.,"The batteries (I bought a backup) didn't last a year. The price for the battery is too high to justify buying the trimmer because it doesn't have the power to cut through even a thick patch of grass, let alone a tough weed."
2,Disappointing,"This item does, work but very ineffectively. Recommended only for those with a very small yard or very light duty weed edging needs. Does not do a very good job of cutting normal grass. My wife probably will use it only for trimming between some of her flowers."
5,Best trimmer!,"We have had our Worx GT for over 2 years now and it is fantastic. We had a gas trimmer (heavy, fumes, breaking line- terrible!) The Worx GT is lightweight, easy to use, and no fumes! Plus it can edge and trim around anything easily! My neighbors are always asking why our lawn always looks so good, and how we trim around my son's playset. They have seen me out trimming 8 months pregnant- Ha. This is an amazing tool."
3,Worx Evaluation,"The Worx has lots of nice features, but the string is too small in diameter. It works great on grass and other light weeds, but the power isn't strong enough to take care of any significant growth."
1,I had hopes....Should of read reviews.,"I bought this unit with the other accessories falling for the HYPE. Go on youtube and watch the infomercial again. They actually only show you the unit being used in slow motion. I can see why now. What a joke. I have had these units for over 6 months and this pack came with 3 batteries...I can see why. This thing is a disaster. The power runs out so fast, you can count the seconds till it won't even spin. And let me stop myself...""Power""....is the wrong word. Even at full charge this thing has NO POWER. I wish it would of worked. Cool idea....100% failure on execution. Oh well....I am going to sell the entire package at my yard sale to the next sucker. Just bought the ryobi 4 stroke trimmer for $69 (Refurb). What a dream. A trimmer that works."
2,worxless,"A friend gave me the worx because she was fed up. Would not charge/hold charge. I found it disgusting and true. Reading the reviews it seems like a common flaw - hard to believe they haven't fixed it - great idea, but poor product. How frustrating!!"
1,worx is worst,brand new 5min. it wont set out line wheels fell off help line is torture i made mistake today of trashing the box it came in .
3,Good only if you have the time,This trimmer is good for those who have all the time in the world. We edge the front yard then put the battery on the charger. Mow the front then the backyard. Then we get the battery off the charger and edge the back yard. Battery will last for a little more then 200 feet of edging. The only plus is no dragging of a cord and it is less intrusive then a gas edger.
1,Lithium battery dead after 3 uses,"Add me to the list of people with battery problems. I used in twice last season, twice this season. When I went to charge it up the last time, the charger says the battery is charged after 2 minutes. When I go to use the trimmer it dies in 30 seconds. I put the battery back on the charger and it says it's charged in 2 minutes. Trimmer goes dead in 30 seconds."
2,Wish I would have researched first,"I bought this on impulse after catching the infomercial by mistake. I needed a trimmer so I thought this one sounded great. Well, it certainly isn't all it is cracked up to be. The battery doesn't last very long at all. My front yard is average to small size and it takes two charges to get it done. The string???? OMG! I had to stop every five minutes to adjust new string. There is no auto-matic release. Plus the new spools they sent had to be unwound and rewound because the waxy string was fused together. I certainly could have done just as well if I would have visited the local store.I would not recommend this product for this price."
3,Yikes WORKZ,I like the light weight feature of the WORKZ Trimmer Edger. I wish I had bought a second battery as backup. The first one lasted one hour and I was not finished with the yard. I also wish the cutting cord could be heavier. This tool works well if you maintain the yard on a frequent and regular basis. It was not meant for heavy and prolonged cutting.
4,Like gadgets,"So far so good with the trimmer. Only had it a short time, but seems to work well. The battery holds up long enough to trim a normal size lawn. Won't cut heavy grass, but does a good job on the normal lawn grass. Light weight for my wife to use."
3,Not up to par with their TV ads,"Does a good job on fine blades grass, but lacks the power in heavier lawn cover or weeds."
1,Disappointed,"The product does not stand up to the TV promo. After a full battery charge, the equipment lasted about 15 minutes. I'm already older but now I'm also wiser."
1,Weak and unconfortable,"This trimmer simply lacks the power needed to do what a line trimmer does. It is also cumbersome and uncomfortable to use. I'm removing the spool and giving the trimmer to my son for a toy. Seriously, I'm not the least bit afraid of him getting hurt with this trimmer. It really is that weak."
1,worx gt trimmer sucks,My father bought a works GT trimmer two years ago . The battery life only lasted about 5 minutes and we were not able to get a new one because no one ever answered our phone calls to customer service. The trimmer sucks it doesn't do anything as advertised. the company does not honor any of their guarantees.very frustrated with it all.
4,Worx cordless string trimmer and hedge trimmer,We have a moderate size yard in So.Cal. St. Augustine and ivy in front and back. Also good sized bushes along the side of the home. Although these units are not as powerful as gas or electric they work great. Very light and comfortable to use. Really like the edger action. It has a hard time rolling if debris is on the walk but does great rolling on the lawn. Must replace the anemic string it comes w/ for .065 string. The hedge trimmer works great on the ivy and bushes. Battery life is strong for about 30 min. then starts fizzin'. 2 batteries recommended for big projects. Makes my yard work much easier. Glad I made the purchase.
4,Works great as a trimmer - edger could be improved,"On the positive side, the battery power of this tool makes it convenient to use and easy to operate. The trimming capabilities are excellent and the tool is light-weight and very portable. However the edging capability is only adequate and requires a very good battery charge... A true all-purpose edger does a better job edging than this tool does. I think that they are on something with this product, and as soon edging improves... this will be ideal tool."
1,doesn't work very good as an edger,"The worx gt doesnt work very good as an edger. The guard that flips down to guide it around the curb is in the wrong place and will eat your yard up. The guard needs to be in line with the weed eater line, and it is not. It is set back about an inch too far. It works great as a weed eater but I wouldnt recommend using it as an edger."
1,Frustrating,"I've had my Worx 150.1 for 3 years. It worked fine for my needs (just trimming ""volunteer grass"" & weeds). I love the fact that you don't have to fuel it with ethanol-cursed gas & there's no restraining cord. I even recommended it to friends. BUT NOW it has developed a cronic non-feed problem. It runs fine for about 20 seconds then as the RPMs increase you realize that it failed to auto-feed. I was so ticked off with this ailment that twice I just threw the cursed thing away while uttering things I can't repeat here. I never had a problem with the battery, so it'll probably explode next time I use it. I intend to go back to the folks I had recommended it to and advise them not to waste any money on this piece of trash. I give it a grade of ""G"" because that's the letter below ""F""...It's made in China (naturally) and I suspect this is their way of raising the blood pressure and stress levels of Americans. Over and Out."
1,Garbage,Bought this because I saw it on TV adds that it looks so easy to use. Ordered it and was so happy the first few weeks. After two months battery started loosing power. Worx sent me a replacement battery but same thing happened. After two months it starts to loose power again. Nice Idea but poor quality. I'm sorry to say that but I'll never gonna buy worx product again.
2,WORX Grass Trimmer,"The trimmer is light, easy to start and easy to use. It does a great job on light grass and weeds but not well on heavily congested areas. Tall weeds get wrapped around the spool and bog it down. The battery is a joke. The battery that came with it would only last about 5-10 minutes. I contacted the company via their battery repalcement web page and they send me another one. It only lasts about 20 minutes. Not even long enought to get around my pasture once much less the 3 times around the ball fiels that it advertises. My advice is to check out other brands before spending your money on the WORX trimmer unless all you want to trim around is a flower pot."
3,Proper use of a suburito,A suburito was never intended for combat rather it's intended to build ones strength & timing! In this way you can hold the lighter katna without feeling fatigue
2,"Decent, I guess, but too light","I purchased this item in order to be able to practice with something resembling a tachi. Unfortunately, this was much too light -- not sure why the shipping weight is eight pounds (even with the box, it didn't weigh that much). It is not appreciably heavier than the Cold Steel O-bokken. Also, after the first use there was some splintering on the handle and I had to tape it. The finish could be better, but the wood itself appears to be satisfactory."
2,Not for the veteran hunter,"Reviews looked great, unfortunately i think they where written by newbies to archery hunting. For the price you can't beat it for a starter release. Do not care for the smoothness of the release nor the nylon whimpy strap that connects the release to your wrist. The scenario ""You get what you pay for "" holds true for this item."
4,So I followed the author's advice,"I really did. I sat down and wrote an email to an old friend that I had snubbed. Now, I agree with some of you that Liz Pryor's letter writing advice was subpar, but I did it anyway. I don't know how it will turn out with my old friend, but I feel a weight has been lifted -- if nothing else, I acknowledged the end of a friendship, without recrimination, without accusation.That's why I think highly of this book. Liz Pryor inspired me, through stories, to make a change in my life. The book isn't a Pulitzer Prize-winner, but it doesn't need to be. Pryor addressed an issue that resonates with women, an issue that hadn't been addressed in this way before."
3,When friendships crumble,"Women can be really cruel to one another, even ""Best Friends"" of over 30 yrs. Not saying anything, just ignoring, pulling away, ""customs"" & annual events you always did together, other plans get made that don't include you are all passive aggressive signs. But since you have never seen this behavior from ""her"" you don't expect or recognize it for what it really is, rejection, walking away. The best part you will find out is that YOU did not do anything wrong. SHE DID! Read the book"
4,Good Book at Explaining Why Some Friendships End,"After a friend of 16 years dropped off the face of the earth, I always wondered what happened. After running into her 5 years later and still feeling angry, I picked up a copy of this book. It helped me to see that I am not the only one this has happened to. The stories in the book made me see that women's frienships change over time. Especially, when one of the friends undergoes a major life change. I felt better about things reading the book. However, it made me sad to see how awful some women can be to one another. If you don't want to be friends with soemone anymore, for whatever reason, you need to tell them so they can move on."
5,Finally.....some validation and perspective,"This book was a wonderful read - I didn't want it to end. Liz's writing style is bouncy and easy going. She moves you through the visual elements of each of the stories of the women who's lives were left in tatters over unexplained abruptly ended friendships. I needed some help on this subject, having been dumped by a great friend from my childhood seven years ago. I still carried the confusion and sadness and wondered how she could have done this. What was she thinking?The book reveals much insight into those women who are the ""dumpers"" What that process was like for them. There aren't many books out there on this subject - so grab this one and have a few tissues on hand - the tears you will shed will be not only for these stories of broken hearts, but for the sorrow you still might carry around for your own loss. Well done, Liz"
3,Debes darle una oportunidad,"Este disco marca un giro un tanto radical en cuanta a las letras y al estilo que traía Mägo en discos anteriores. En este disco están más abocados a la protección de la tierra y sus seres (Gaia: la madre naturaleza). Sin embargo, mantienen el estilo Rock/Fulk/Celta de discos como Finisterra. Este cambio más que todo en la letras no caído bien a los oídos de ciertos fans que son un poco más metaleros y gustan más de discos como Jesús de Chamberí y La leyenda de la mancha.Personalmente el disco me gusta, es solo que es un poco ""suave"" (en lo que a la letras de las canciones se refiere creo que el más suave y ""romántico"" de todos), aun así hay que darle una oportunidad al disco y escuchar el mensaje positivo que intenta dar.Eso sí la calidad del disco, sobre todo la mezclas y la claridad del sonido es superior a los discos anteriores."
4,Entertainment for adults as well!,"I must start this by saying that I am an adult. I happen to be flipping the channels about three years ago after getting home from work and found the Wishbone series on PBS. I was immediately hooked! I have been watching ever since. I love all the Wishbone episodes, but this particular one is in my top 5. I find that the ones that I like the best are not released on video at this time. I can't wait until all the episodes are released because I would buy them all! I really like how each episodes shows a shortened version of the classic story, and then has a modern story that correlates. So far, there has only been one edisode that covered a book that I had not read, so I immediately read that one as well. Not to mention that this show has one incredibly CUTE dog!"
4,must have for mythology buff,"This book is a brief yet concise ovierview of the major characters in the Greek, Roman, Celtic and Norse mythological legends. Worthy purchase for someone wanting to get into the study of mythology or just add to your collection."
5,above and beyond great service,"I ordered this on a friday morning and i got it on that monday, and it was even gift wrapped. I will for sure use this store again. Awesome service."
1,Doesn't fit Motorola 5.8Ghz DIGITAL phones...,"Perhaps I missed something, but I assumed (I know, I know...) that they wouldn't still be selling batteries for analog cordless phones, or if they did, that a 5.8Ghz analog phone didn't exist. My Motorola 5.8Ghz digital has a battery pack made of 3 AAA NiMh batteries; _this_ one is made of 3 AA NiMh batteries, and it doesn't physically fit inside the phone. The back of the package says it fits ""Motorola MA300, MA350, MA351, MA361, MA362"" (among many other models of other brands) but cautions that you should ""Check size, shape, and connector type for match."" Kind of hard to do when they don't list those things in the product description."
5,LAST NIGHT AN ANGEL STOPPED BY,"""LAST NIGHT AN ANGEL STOPPED BY"" WAS THE MOST INSPIRING, UPLIFTING BOOK I HAVE EVER READ. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT FOR ALL AGES. AS A CHILD, I GREW UP IN TENNESSEE, AND I WAS A SOUTHERN BAPTIST. AS I GREW UP I REALIZED THAT I DID NOT HAVE TO GO TO CHURCH IN ORDER TO KNOW GOD. I HAVE A BROTHER IN TENNESSEE, WHO IS A MINISTER, AND CONDEMS ME AND ANYONE ELSE, TO HELL, WHO DOES NOT ATTEND HIS CHURCH, AND ESPECIALLY IF ONE DOES NOT SPEAK IN TONGUES. THIS BOOK PROVES TO ME THAT I HAVE BEEN RIGHT WITH GOD ALL ALONG. THANK YOU LOGAN AND DARNELL.I KNOW THE AUTHORS OF THIS BOOK, AND CONSIDER THEM MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY. DONA, THE MOTHER OF DARNELL, AND THE WIFE ON LOGAN, I KNOW HAD TO BE APART OF THIS EFFORT. I APPLAUD THEM! THANK YOU LOGAN AND DARNELL FOR MY SIGNED COPY. I WILL READ AND REREAD, AND TREASURE IT FOREVER."
1,Don't waste your money.,"The pages of this book came in handy for my bar-b-que, although it was costly to use it for that. Coal is cheaper and burns much better. I couldn't make sense of it or what Mr. Bohen was telling us, the unlucky readers who actually paid money for this drivel."
4,Worse than Led Zeppelin: the Stone's 1972 US tour,"Full of casual sex and violence, this is a salacious account of life on the road with the Rolling Stones. Greenfield excels at nailing personalities and describing the fishbowl the band lived in. The Stones begin the tour in a vulnerable state of mind, scared that their glory days are behind them. Their braggadocio picks up considerably as the tour progresses. Near the end we have 16 year old girls doing ""favors"", beatings are given to anyone who steps out of line, groupies being filmed ""in action"" (despite Bill Wyman's 10 yr old kid hanging around!) for that infamous tour movie who's title I can't even mention here. Plenty of cruel nihilism. Oh well, I didn't read this expecting a nursery rhyme! This book delivers, warts and all."
5,The Seminal Book on Shame,"I can't count how many people I've met over the years, who like me, think this book changed their lives. It offers major, dazzling insight into human experience that's clear, humane, and just plain brilliant. Everyone, famous or not, writing about shame in the last 2 decades owes a debt to this book whether they admit it or not. And when you hear a character like the heroine of ""Clueless"" talk about having a major shame spiral--this is where the term originated. That's how significant this book is--it's influenced popular culture, and the author's still alive. I highly recommend the author's other books on shame, and his children's book, Stick Up For Yourself!"
5,Hard Country,"Excellent movie, entertaining in every aspect from the story line to the music. A must see for country fans."
5,Excellent book on the Hebrew Idioms that are in the Bible,"This book can be read and re-read over and over because there is much depth here. Jesus used the Hebrew language of the day to express Truth about the Kingdom of God. Robert Lindsey and others help to uncover the real meanings behind the Gospel sayings of Jesus. Buy it, Read it and change your thinking about the Kingdom!"
2,Picture is deceiving,"I bought these on Amazon to use for a plane trip, and to have when taking my granddaughter with me shopping, etc.. The picture on the front of the packaging is deceiving as it implies that the pad is as long as the child, yes? They are not -- they are 19"" long. Some will say: ""You don't have to have the child completely on the pad"" and I would agree with this statement UNLESS you ARE in an airplane or in a department store bathroom, utilising the changing table -- THEN, it is nice to have the child protected.Will use up, but not repurchase."
4,Small but good to have when you need them,These are somewhat small but are great to have in your diaper bag when you need them. They are basically a very thick paper toweling with a plastic lining on the back to prevent leaks. Excellent for those changes when traveling or shopping.
5,Great for travel,I use these when I travel so I don't have to take my big diaper pad and they are easy to throw away if needed. If it stays clean I fold it back up and use it until the end of the trip. They are not super long but my regular diaper pad isn't that long either.
2,Unappropriate but comprehensive,"This is a jargon Spanish-English Dictionary with good coverage of business terms. However, the reality is that Spanish-speaking countries often use different terms for the same concept. To be useful, such a dictionary, in addition to just translating a term to the other language, should offer a brief definition, enough for a person to know if the term means what he wants to say. In the case that different terms exist for the same concept, it would be very helpful if the dictionary specified the country or countries that use each specific term. From the English side, which I am not familiar with, it could be that UK, Australia and the US have different terms too.. A dictionary that did not deal with such realities should better be called a Mexican Spanish-US English Dictionary.."
3,Heavily biased,This book overpromotes certain vendor web services offerings. This is more than likely caused by the authors day job as an industry analyst where they get paid to write nice things about vendors who offer suboptimal solutions.I would encourage managers wanting to learn about web services to purchase a book targeted towards developers and only read the first several chapters. Developing Web Services and Java Web Services Architecture are two good books that fill this need.
5,"Lucid, comprehensive book close to the software market","This book is incredibly clear and dense at the same time. Anne Manes accomplishes to show in a vendor neutral way an entire market of products in an emerging industry. I am thoroughly impressed.This book is not for the faint of heart. It does not contain source code, but still requires a lot of technical understanding from the reader. An excellent book also for developers."
1,Awful,This product is cheap looking and overpriced. From the description it makes it sound like you're getting 3 organizer units but it's only 1. Go to Target and buy their cloth ones for $8. Much nicer for a fraction of the price. Don't waste your money.
2,"Great Songs, Great Entertainer, poor execution on Astaire's part","I hate to disagree with the other reviewers who found this CD enjoyable but I found this CD to be very disappointing. I actually like Astaire's singing voice in the old movies and find his voice on this CD to be pleasant and unassuming however it lacks polish. This CD sounds like Astaire needed to spend a week or two getting his singing talent back up to speed. He sounds like a pleasant amateur who is struggling with the songs. The Amazon samples played on a notebook computer sound excellent. However, playing the CD on a decent player shows all Astaire's weakness as a singer. It is just painful. The songs are excellent and Oscar Peterson's combo is outstanding. It is disappointing that the producers didn't give Astaire an adequate number of takes to get it right. They almost had something wonderful here."
5,A trilogy worth reading.,"If you are a Barbara Cartland fun , I strongly recoment that you read it.Thalia, Penelope and Alisa,Illouka and the three Earls will travel you back to the eigtheen century where love will eventualy find it's way.Music from the heart,I think is the best of the three novels.(FOR ROMANTIC SOULS ONLY! )"
3,WEll they are very nice but......,"they need elongation , they are very short ,but the stories are wonderful but they need more...... but if u like stories to get to the point , u will love them"
1,Give me a break!,I was stuck on a plane for 14 hours and this was the only book the flight attendant could find for me. To put it mildly...THIS BOOK BLOWS!
5,excellent socio-political analysis,"This is one of the best works I have read recently on Mexican politics. Castaneda's review is one of clarity and insight. This book is a great resource for analysis on the Mexican electoral system, popular dissent, and the history of the PRI. I highly recommend this one."
5,This is cool!,"This is a sweet sword, dont practice hitting things with it, because it might easily break, IT IS MEANT TO PRACTICE THE DIFFERENT SAMURAI MOTIONS, not to hit your little brother with, though the handguard may be missing, it looks better without it, I really like the sword, considering I used it for what it is made for PRACTICING."
4,where is SUMMER LOVE ?????,"Felicia Sander's ""Summer Love"" is one of the best non-charted (or obscure) songs I ever listened to and it's very rude that they always overlook this. Eric Records (or Bear Family) should do the job of compiling Felicia Sander's complete recordings. I will give this album a 4 but will change it to 5 star if they add ""Summer Love."""
2,Exercise physiology,"The book cover is too old and look dirty, with black tape all over the front and back. However, the inside pages are okay."
1,Amazon sent wrong video card twice.,This is my first bad experience ordering on Amazon. Sent 128mb version twice when I ordered 256mb version.
3,It seemed important at the time.,"Gloria seems very spoiled and no wonder. She has had a very interesting life but seems most interested in herself.It makes you wonder how she every had a wonderful son like Anderson Cooper. He seems so down to earth and very concerned with the world and the people in it.Gloria seems only interested in ME, ME, Me."
2,Entertaining but not deep,"I enjoyed reading the book, but it was short and didn't give as much information as I thought. A lot of it was common sense advice on romance and love. If you are looking for a light, quick read, go for it. Don't expect a full disclosure biography."
1,This book is not important,"This book can be read in 1 hour...nothing of substance. She rambles and it is not in order...you become confused as to when something is happening in her life andd who she is married to at the time she is having another affair. It seems that her love affairs were important, but not her children."
4,"Maybe not important, but intersting","Gloria Vanderbilt was 80 years old when she published this book, which I find astonishing. She has lived through so much tragedy, lived so many different lives, had so many relationships that much of it really does not matter anymore, but it is interesting to read about it."
1,"no insight, little descriptive prose; some names and some not named","The only reason to explain this book is that the publisher made a bad decision. Vanderbilt is vaccuous, her divorces and even the loss of her son by suicide is glossed over. Some of her lovers are named, some are not, but it doesn't matter.... everything is a short snippet with Gloria always bouncing on to the next romance. Vanerbilt masters the art of having nothing to say. ""It seemed important at the time"" should read it isn't important now and the way its written, it probably never was. One star is one too many"
2,Who is the real Gloria?,"This book lacks depth and leaves the reader feeling that we still don't know Gloria Vanderbilt. Also, why does she give the impression that she only has one living son? What kind of mother would disregard her two older children? Very sad.A much better book on the Vanderbilts is ""Fortunes Children"". I recommend it."
3,I would give it 3.5 actually,"The book was much shorter than I thought, and the writing was a bit too scattered, too many side notes - but good. I would average it out to be a 3.5 and you will find it funny, interesting if you know the characters or have read much about them. When you think of them as people it becomes harder to grasp, but characters seems a more realistic yardstick to use. I love Gloria Vanderbilt, I admire her and feel that she deserves applause and praise, but this one didn't do it for me. Maybe a good book to take traveling."
2,A Walk on the Rich Side,"A fast read about the lives of the rich and famous of a former time. I believe many of the younger readers won't connect with either Ms. Vanderbilt or her lovers, but for the older folk it's a few hours of fun they might have missed out on."
4,Glamorous Biography,"Here is some Hollywood history written by Gloria Vanderbilt. The book is a quick read, and the stories she tells about all her famous boyfriends like Howard Hughes, Marlon Brando, Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra are amazing.I couldn't put this book down. I loved reading about the Glamorous and Romantic life Gloria Vanderbilt has lived."
5,Great illustrations,My daughter and I love flipping through the pages and laughing together. Great illustrations allow you to make up the story as you go.
3,very small book with a little confusing cartoon,a confusing little book for my 2 year old who loves richard scarry books. ended up returned it. Should have bought the $10.99 hardcover book.
1,This is awful - horrible images!!!!,"My son loves Richard Scarry, and we have two dvds he loves: Counting and ABC. This book, however is terrible. The images are chaotic and confusing. And the story is confusing, as well. Not recommended, even for Scarry fans."
1,"Silly, pointless story","I love the ORIGINAL, madcap Richard Scarry stories, but this one is just plain ridiculous. The firefighters spend most of the story cleaning up messy car accidents instead of fighting fires. The final line of the book is something like ""We'll clean up the mess. Don't worry, it's all in a firefighter's day."" What, are they maids?"
5,Another fun book by Richard Scarry great for the young fans!,"I taught school for 25 years. My young students loved Richard Scarry as did I. I now have a 3 yr old grandson who loves books, firetrucks, and being read to! Nana made a big hit with this one, and enjoys reading it as much as Carter enjoys being read to and looking at it."
3,ehhhh it's ok,"My 2 year old son is on a very big Firefighter kick right now so I purchased several different Firefighting books and this is easily his least favorite (and personally I would have to agree). My husband grew up on Richard Scary which is why I bought it in the first place but if I could do it over - I wouldn't.It seems like the story goes like this - everything gets SUPER messy then it gets fixed, then another HUGE mess happens and that gets fixed and then yet ANOTHER massive mishap/mess happens, etc. Seems a bit excessive to me and the art is a bit A.D.D. - everything everywhere!! WAY too much going on - every page is covered!! Maybe some people like that?Personally I recommend ""Curious George and the Firefighters"" and ""Big Frank's Fire Truck"" these were 2 of the other books I bought at the same time and my son LOVES them!! George ranks #1 but Big Frank is a very close 2nd!"
5,Action packed pictures and story!,"Do you think it might be a good idea to hire painters named Drippy and Sticky?Well, In Richard Scarry's fun-filled book A Day at the Fire Station, that's just what happened and much more! Toddlers and young readers will love this story about mishaps galore.This classic children's book is chock full of laughs and action, with illustrations that offer lots for the imagination.Recommended!"
3,book,"this book was not worth what it cost, in my opinion, so if you drop the price I believe you will sell more"
2,Not typical Richard Scarry quality.,"Story was not about a fire station other than silly activity was located in station. Book was gift for clever 4 year old who wondered "" where are the fire men""."
5,a nice addtion...,"added this one to my order though wasn't planning on it, glad I did....my grandson is crazy over firefighter and has the curious george fire fighter book as well, a good pairing..."
4,rubber knife,"The knife was just what I wanted. I am very satisfied with the product, it will work great with my Play Theraphy.Moore8"
3,It's bent,"I read other reviews before making this huge decision. Some stated their knife was bent on delivery. My greatest fear has been realized, my knife is bent. I placed a large clip on it and allowed to bake in the sun. It's still bent. Bummer.Will the bend show in the movie, will it look like a fake rubber knife in the movie?Don't know either..."
3,Depends on what you want it for...,"I used this knife for a film and looked fine on camera, but while using it in a fighting scene, the blade part ripped off.We are unsure if it was just that one unit, or if its not that durable. It is made out of rubber and feels like a really good quality rubber.We purchased 2 more just in case, and they did not break.One con if you use it for a movie, the blade part often bends and is hard to make it strait.Overall, whether you use it for combat training, film or stage, you will enjoy this product."
2,I guess it serves its purpose,"I just recieved this knife. I purchased it as a gift for my husband as he practices various martial arts. This knife was in no type of packaging, and the blade was bent. It has some discoloration on the handle that makes it look very cheap. It does not look as exquisite as the photo, I am almost embarassed to gift it. This will be one of those gifts that come with an explanation. As he is opening it I will probably say something like ""it looked a lot better on the website. I thought about sending it back, but I decided to give it to you anyway so you can use it to practice your martial arts without hurting anyone"" :) In a nutshell, I guess I'm saying its not pretty, but it will serve the purpose for which it was intended. (just dont buy it as a gift)"
3,"Ok for a Prop, not for training","For a prop for a costume, the knife was great. Very real looking yet not real enough to very be considered a true weapon. For a training tool, not so good. After about a day of simple use the 'blade' snapped from the hilt. If your using it for training, look else where."
5,The Spin Doctor,"I thought the book was great. I really enjoyed the way the story went back and forth and then came together at the end. I've never read a book that was written that way and it was a real break the way books are traditionally written.I also liked the way Victor gave all of us a message and awearness about AIDS. The knowledge about AIDS is really needed in the black community and through out the world.Victor is a very unique writer with new styles and fresh ideas. I will not hesitate purchase and read anything he puts out. All greeks need to stick together. Keep up the good work brother.Thank you for the drama,Van Harris (Phi Beta Sigma) vman.com7@juno.com"
5,A One Nighter- Autumn Leaves,This book was hard to put down once you started reading. It is one that can be read in one night. I enjoyed the story line as well as the knowledge. I have never read a book that was so touching. I am looking for a part two.
2,Unappealing writing style,"I read this book because it was chosen for my book club. Though I try to make it a point to finish any book I start, this one wasn't easy for me. Though the characters were interesting enough, I found the writing style and phraseology extremely annoying. It just didn't seem to flow at all. Things would be okay for a paragraph or so then the author threw in language that seemed overly dramatic or really out of sync with the overall picture he was painting. I applaud the effort of anyone who writes a novel but I really didn't enjoy it and doubt I'll read his other works."
2,thumbs down,"This was a book about a very serious subject, AIDS, but the characters had absolutely no depth, and the book was so full of errors, I felt embarrassed for the author while reading it. Very obvious misspellings and grammar turned me off to the storyline. I've noticed the same errors in Casting the First Stone as well. Some of these new authors need to get a professional critique of their work before submitting it for publication, and no that does not mean allowing your mother, sister and girlfriends read the manuscript."
5,TRULY A LOVE SO DEEP,"I loved this book. My heart truly went out to Kennedy. Simpson Stone got what he deserved, he was such an ass. I am happy that it worked out for Marshall and Jasmine. Jasmine was a very stong woman to have endured the things that she went through with Marshall. Legacy was a true friend, even though he was not there at the end with Kennedy, you could truly feel his pain. I wish much success and blessings to Victor McGlothin. Peace!"
4,AUTUMN LEAVES: LOVE SO DEEP,"I thought the book handled a sensitive matter, Aids, with a realistic storyline from all angles. The characters were well developed and could appeal to most age groups. I believe this book should be required reading for preteen, teenagers and young adults. The 30 to 60 age group should read this book to refresh what they already know, but have decided to have selective memory loss. This is definitely a book all book clubs should read because the discussion could last for hours. This book will stir your thoughts emotionally."
4,Lessons to Learn!,"I thought the book had a good story line and I really appreciated the way the author dealt with the issues of AIDS without preaching or being trite. The story is real and can happen to anyone. Kudos to Mr. McGlothin on a job ""well done""."
4,Loved it!,"From the moment that I picked up this book, it was hard to put it down. I laughed and became teary-eyed in a few parts of the story with each turn of events. A great read if you can get past the grammatical errors."
5,"IN AUTUMN LEAVES, THE LOVE IS SOOO DEEP","I, too, would love to see this book on the big screen. Victor McGlothin has created a story with a love so deep, I could feel it. The friendship between Marshall and Rory is beautiful, AND it crosses the color line which anyone can relate to. I was so familiar with the love between Marshall and Jazmine, as the plot thickened I couldn't put the book down. Kudos to Victor McGlothin for working such an important dilemma as AIDS into the story line because we must STOP THE SILENCE!"
4,Pager Turner...,Once again the author has wrote another excellent book. The ending is not what you think. I enjoyed the issues brought up in this book..regarding african americans...was enlightening. Keep up the good work. Waiting for your next winner.
4,A very good story,"This was a story about love and a story about friendships. Both the love and the friendships ran deep. Really it was 2 stories. The story about Marshall, a college football star who digressed from his way of normal life with the death of his best friend. Legacy and Kennedy. They became friends but abruptly this friendship endures a truamatic event. You will need to read this book to find out what the 2 stories lines had in common."
2,Autumn Leaves - An English Teacher's Nightmare,"Autumn Leaves was chosen for review by our book club. I found the author's story line well thought out and the moral of the story commendable. However, I found the grammar to be horrible. I'm not referring to the language of the characters, I am referring to the grammar of the author. A qualified editor would have never allowed this book to be published without clean up. Incorrect punctuation, run-on sentences, etc., etc. It is difficult to believe the author received a Master's from any legitimate school, but I applaud that accomplishment. I do, however, recommend that the author enroll in writing and English classes so that his future offerings are more acceptable by a wider audience."
2,Deceptive name,"The description led me to believe that there would be 200 of the turn buttons with screws. What I got was a package of 100 turn buttons and 100 screws. I guess that adds up to 200 but seems like false advertising to me.The buttons and screws I got worked fine, but not happy with the marketing.Update to my review:I emailed Amazon and they quickly responded back. Apparently I should have received 200 turn buttons with screws.Amazon is providing a resolution."
3,Need to replace the capacitors,I purchased this set in 2007. In 2009 it started making a clicking noise when the set was turned on. It also had a lot of purple in the color. I did some research and a lot of other people were having the same problem. The problem was that Samsung did not put in big enough capacitors. I replaced all of the capacitors with bigger ones and it has worked fine ever since.
1,NOT reliable. Owned just over 1 yr before it needed repair,"My wife and I purchased the Samsung 52"" LCD tv (LN-T5265F) at Best Buy. A little over 1 year of normal use, the tv started making a clicking noise just before it would power on. A month later, the screen failed to turn on after the clicking noise. We were able to find a local tv repairman that could service it (five hundred for parts/ one hundred for labor).After having it serviced, the tv worked fine for a few months, but has now developed several small vertical lines on the left side of the screen. I'm pretty sure that this will probably also get worse and require another expensive repair.This will definitely be the last Samsung product in my house."
2,Waste of money,"Would have given it 1 star but it did give me 3 years of excellent HDBut after 3 years. Dead. My TV will no longer turn on. Started a few months ago. It would click and attempt to turn on. After a few minutes it would come on. Over the months, the attempt would take longer and longer. Yesterday it took 30 minutes before it came on. Today, dead. Seems this is a common problem.[...]Spend your cash elsewhere"
1,Only lasted until the warranty expired,Bought this TV in 2008 at Circuit City. Picture was great until a little after a year. The screen would be unevenly lit. Half of the screen was brighter than the other half. Then the colors started becoming washed out. The repair guy initially said the digital board was bad so he ordered another one. Samsung had the part back ordered for 3+ months so I had to wait 3+ months for the repair guy to tell me that didn't fix the issue and that it was the panel that had gone bad. The panel is worth more than the TV. Spent about $2300 on this TV. I will never buy another samsung product again. Their customer support is poor and the quality of their products seem to be lacking. Funny how things always fail right after the warranty expires.
2,Great while it lasted,"Bought the tv in the fall of '07 for just under 3k.We had done our homework and this was a good buy at the time.Pink pixels started appearing and we called a Samsung repairguy. He said that it would cost too much to repair and to buy a new one (around 1300). I looked up the problem online and MANY other people are having the same problem with this model.Luckily, we had purchased an extended warranty but it expired last week. But Amazon has a 30 day grace period so another repair guy is coming out next week. Wish us luck!"
4,samsung LNT5265F,Have had the Samsung lcd just over a month now and so far it has been all I would have hoped for and the picture in HD is outstanding. It still seems like more TV for the money than anything I have seen. Delivery was satisfactory(on time). I would recommend this TV to anyone for the right size room and it is the perfect size for my living room 22 x 22. Also would recommend a surround sound system to enhance even farther
1,Lasted Only 2 Years!,"This TV was fine until it stopped powering up after two years only. There is a defect. Do an online search and you will see numerous complaints about this defect, which Samsung will not acknowledge. A one year warranty is not enough. If you dare to buy it, purchase an extended warranty. I found out the hard way and now I must pay hundreds to have it repaired. I will never buy another Samsung TV...period...underline."
4,12/19/08 price refurb $1250,"I had a Samsung HP-P4271 1024 x 768 res. I bought only 5 years ago. I couldn't believe that this refurb was miles ahead of my old HP-P4250 what ever that is. First I paid $2200 for 42"" of 1024x768 and 3000-1 contrast res max. With only one DVI-D input no HDMI. When I got my new HD sat receiver updated in Sept and the guy couldn't hook it up to my TV cause it had old DVI-D input So that's when I knew I needed a newer TV already. You can get the Yamaha new RX-V1900 7.1 surround @ 140W per chan w 4 HDMI inputs. You should put everything through that first. Blue ray, xbox, PS3, and computer. I'm HDMI crazy. They got to get rid of everything else and just leave HDMI.So anyway I paid $1250 refurb at Compusa and $80 shipping freight. The Yamaha V1900 is around $1200 still cause its so new. But the V1800 got the same 4 HDMI inputs for around $800 online Then your set for COD4."
5,Beautiful Picture!!!,"Please note this LCD tv does not have an anti glare screen. First and only lcd i have ever seen like this. First was disappointed with that feature, but have grown to love it. Gives clearer, more crisp picture. Still would not reccomend for heavily lit rooms."
3,Samsung LNT5265F 1080p lcd hdtv,"My husband and I LOVE this TV, however three weeks after we received it we have green lines on the top of the screen and white lines running throughout the whole picture. We called amazon and they are resolving the problem this week. We hope this is just a defect and they will replace it immediately. We've only heard good things about this TV."
3,Hi-Gloss Screen = Plasma,"Samsung made a fatal design flaw on this TV; going with a gloss screen put in the realm of Plasma TV's. According to the CNET review of the 46"" version, if you plan to put this in a sunny room you better have good blinds. They compared it to a black mirror, and after visiting Sears this weekend, I have to agree. If you are going to deal with glare, you're better off buying a plasma; they're cheaper and produce far supirior blacks. Somewhere Samsung lost the ball on matt screen = bright rooms = LCD = no glare. Maybe they will correct their mistake in the next release."
1,Missing Accessories,"TV was shipped without manual, remote control, power cables, etc. TV only.Amazon and Samsung are slow to respond to situation, so far only have got the run around. TV sitting on floor not operating."
4,SAMSUNG 52'',THE ONLY THING I DONT LIKE IS THE MOST OF THE SHOWS THE BACK GROUND MUSIC IS MORE LOUD THAT THE PERSON TAKING BUT THE REST IS O.K
1,BE CAREFUL with REFURBISHED items!,"Product is being returned! I had great delivery service even though it was delayed at the beginning. It was suppose to be a refurbished LCD but looked used when it got here. There were two issues with it: (1) a horizontal gray area about 8-10"" wide in the middle of the LCD and (2) sometimes the LCD would not turn on (but you can hear movie though). There were also issues with the colors - green and red. I had to constantly adjust the colors. With this experience, I decided to stay away from LCDs until the technology matures for larger screens. Seems like all bad LCD stories happen with the larger screens. So, I went and bought a 50"" Panasonic plasma instead."
4,Great value,"My family selected this TV for its pricepoint and excellent reviews - so let me say first: we have not been disappointed!The picture quality is good, as well as the built-in speakers. We were easily able to hook it up to an Onkyo receiver for a/v switching. I'll mention some of the negatives, because that's why these reviews are read in the first place.1) There is a fair amount of glare, so make sure you have that issue addressed covered before you buy it.2) it attracts/dust fingerprints easily3) when we return to the main screen from watching DVDs on my xbox 360 the TV reports it is an incompatible video mode and then goes black. Pretty annoying. I'm pretty sure it's not an xbox setting, but maybe it something on the receiver I haven't figured out yet.4) TV buttons are harder to access now, becuase they're on the top of the TVOverall: Excellent buy. Great image quality. Great sound. I wouldn't let the cons mentioned above stop me from buying it again."
2,refurbished lcd tv,"This is like my third tv was shipped.1st TV - power goes out after 30 min of watching.2nd TV - damaged on the right coner of the displayed.3rd TV - they sent me a refurbished tv that someone had replace the turner box. Some how the tech didnt put it back in correctly and it is not aligned in the center, and had several front face stratch."
4,Good but not outstanding,"I bought this TV during december 2007. Definitely I would like to suggest the following few points to the new buyers.1. I am not saying this TV is bad. Definitely this TV is worth for the money I paid. But I would consider paying that $600 more to get the next model LNT5271F which is very good comparing to the 65F.2. Screen reflects a lot, very good on dark rooms and no lights infront of the tv and no windows infront of the TV.3. Refresh rate is low. You will see the boxes when picture moves fast. It's more visible when the picture is shown close-up and moving."
1,Cheap Capacitors spoiled a great TV,"I once Love(d) this TV. Paid $2950 for it through Amazon in 2007. I still think Amazon is great, but now the TV is having the problem common to all Samsung TVs. Takes a long time to turn on, clicks and clicks, and when it does come on it has distortion in picture. Amazon can do nothing for me but suggests I contact Samsung customer service. Samsung customer service(?) writes back and says ""they don't have a record of problems with this TV"" (liars!) and suggested it was a bad surge protector. I am not giving up and will pursue Samsung fixing this for free. I don't think I should have to take the risk of opening up the TV and replacing the capacitors myself as many others have done (search internet for Samsung capacitor problems and you will find many links and Utube videos). A $3000 TV should last more than 4 years. It would have been nice if Amazon had offered to pay for getting it fixed.Buyer Beware: Don't buy Samsung products!"
1,Read this Review if You are Thinking of Buying -- Capacitors Fail and Picture Fails,"A year after purchasing this tv, it would not start up anymore due to the fact that the capacitors blew. I had to take it apart myself and replace them. Then, the picture started developing these pixelated lines that run vertically on both the left and right side. The fix is too expensive. Do not purchase this tv. Do a little more research and you will find that these problems are a pattern for this tv. I spent $2300 and could have purchased something much better for a lot less. Very disappointed."
5,great TV!!!,"did my research like everyone else and was between this and the sony XBR LCDs. the contrast on these monitors are great, much better than any other LCDs currently on the market. Amazon white glove delivery service was great and it's really a sharp looking unit. to the shiny finish of the tv, that is part of what gives this LCD the great contrast ratios, so it was a conscious engineering decision made by samsung. the traditional matte finishes were meant to cover up hot spot issues w/ LCDs, but also resulted in lesser contrast ratios. highly recommended!"
2,Problems with the LNT5265F,"We bought this LCD in June and we loved it. BUT by September, barely three moths later, we started having an issue with the picture disappearing. Screen would just go BLACK. Sound ok, but absolutly nothing on the screen (including the menu). Next day, it's fine. This has been happening on and of now wvery few weeks. Yeah, try to get service there when the problem is happening... LOLI am thinking I just got stuck with a lemon, and have filed a complaint with Samsung, so we'll see how it goes...."
4,Very good tv,"First the poor: This tv does absolutely nothing to help standard definition signals. With some adjusting you can make it look fair to poor over satellite (I really didn't no how poor the signal was from my satellite until I hooked up this tv). The good: This tv looks good with a 480p DVD player, looks very good with an up-converting dvd player, and looks exceptional with HD DVD (you do need to make adjustments to get the most out of tv, see: ""avs forum"" for help as it has a strong following there). Conclusion, very very nice tv but go ahead and upgrade your satellite or cable to HD before your new tv arrives."
5,The very best HDTV I could find,"We shopped for 3 months for a spectacular deal on an awesome set, and we sure got it with this purchase. The price is the best we could find and the quality of the picture is stunning. We were a little sceptical about having the set shipped to us, but the packaging was more than adequate and it arrived in perfect condition. The look, features, quality and price make this one of the best purchases we have made. Thank you Amazon, Vann's and Samsung!"
3,Quit worrying and do it,"I done loads of research before making this purchase. I done so much research that I started confusing myself a bit. The only downfall to this purchase was I didnt do it sooner and ended up costing myself about 200 dollars after the price went up.This by far is the best of the bunch in my opinion and I couldnt be any happier with the timing of delivery, purchase or the product itself. Plus stay away from monster HD cables. I bought 3 HD cables from amazon for less than 20 bucks and they work just as good as a monster."
5,Amazon is the only way to go,After losing sleep for 2 months of research looking to buy the right $3000 TV (before my family got back from vacation) I found Amazon selling the best TV at the absolute best price with the most value. The delivery was 7 days early and the white glove was great. The delivery guy set the whole TV and DVD player up for me. All this was at least $500 - $1000 less than the least expensive least trustworthy online store. Not to mention I saved all the taxes ($250) I would have spent at Big Buy. If you are going through the same girations searching for the right place to spend your money go no further. Thanks Amazon!
4,Great Set,The TV looks great. I had read some reviews where some said they had to make several picture and sound adjustments. But so far Ive found the defult settings are fine and the picture looks great. Being a gamer I was also was looking for a LCD set and my Xbox360 games look amazing. But if you still have a Playstaion2 you may want to upgrade to Playstation3 or 360 because Playstation2 isnt HD and doesnt look too hot. I had planned on getting this at Circuit City but on the advice of my Dad I ordered it thru Amazon and saved a few hundred dollars. The only reason Im giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is because this type of product needs to stand the test of time before accurate review can be given. I dont want to be one of those fools who rave about something than have it go south. but so far samsung has made a believer out of me.
2,has all the reflections of a plasma,"One of the reviewers mentioned that this LCD TV behaves like a plasma (all light sources get reflected on the TV) -- he/she is absolutely right. For me, the reason to buy an LCD TV over plasma is to have no glare. This TV's glare is as bad as a plasma's."
2,Poor quality control. Two of four in my pack had hooks spaced too wide for the pegboard.,"Well, I bought from Ace Hardware these quarter inch hooks and ironically half of them didn't have the hooks spaced properly for the 1/4"" pegboard I bought from Ace Hardware, and was actually surplus of the very pegboard they use in their stores! I tried to bend one a bit to get it into my pegboard wall and the weld broke and it came apart in my hand. The fourth I ended up using but after doing a bit of damage to the peg holes in my pegboard. Sheesh! When you buy something as simple as wire bent to spec you'd think it would be. You just can't take anything for granted anymore."
2,Nice Features but can be troublesome.,"My main concern about this trimmer is its serious lacking of a safety switch. The user have to be very aware when switching from one cutting position to another, if not, your can easily trigger the unit on and cause serious injuries. I got pass the first flaw and proceed to edge my lawn, I had to stop several times to trigger auto-feed the spool and twice to manually feed due to the fact that the spool completely cut off, so I unplugged, remove the spool head and re-feed, this all happened within the first 10-15 min of usage. Another thing I was willing to get past was the construction; for the price I figured it would be ok... but it all plastic of some sort and the seams come apart (not completely but I saw great amount of separation that told me the thing won't last long) when switching cutting positions. I'm returning it."
1,#WG 103 String Trimmer,"Purchase of this item was a mistake for me. While the design of the machine is excellent, the nylon line that is provided is worthless. The trimmer works great in an open field, but cannot approach an obstacle without the line breaking. Heavy duty replacement line purchased at a local hardware store lasted longer, but is still unsatisfactory. The time required to replace the line makes this tool unacceptable."
1,Never Will I Buy a Worx Product Again !,"After four years of frustration with the WORX WG103 and its faulty line feed, I am finally throwing it in the garbage, because that's where it belongs. I can only guess at the number of hours I have spent trying to get the line feed to work properly. Wouldn't the designers of this product have tested the line feed before releasing it for sale to an unsuspecting public? Apparently not. The so-called Help Line just refers you to the website where there is really no help at all. So, when it comes to WORX products, BUYERS BEWARE !"
4,Worth a read,"This book is old (from the 1970's) and written with a personal bias, but it gives a good idea of the Amin reign."
1,No item received yet,Please take notre i have not received this item yet. I have already sent a couple of email telling about the situation but i have not received any feedback from amazon.Thanks ibn advance for your response
5,MAKES OPTIMUM USE OF EXTRA SPACE,"We all know friends, neighbours and co-workers who have everything in their garage except the family car. The car usually gets booted out the door in favour of lawn furniture and equipment, camping supplies, and anything else that comes along.In this book, the reader will find a variety of uses for the garage over and above ""a place to stash the useful and useless odds and ends."" Personally, I liked the greenhouse and studio ideas, but there are others here, too, such as the soundstage that would excite the teen-aged musician in the family, and a playroom to keep younger children amused for hours.This is one of the first books I have seen on garages and it has some excellent ideas. With over fifty concepts contained here, the book has something to please every lifestyle and virtually every taste. The reader is only limited by their budget, but many of the ideas can be scaled down or expanded upon depending on the financial resources available."
2,Not garages exactly,"This book and the great mass of the photos relate not to the garage, ie, a covered space where cars are stored or where a hobbyist workshop is located, but converted space or living space above a garage. If you're interested in creative garage layout, workshop arrangement, automobile-related storage, etc., this is not the book. If your desire is to turn a hardworking garage into a granny flat, this is for you."
4,great book,Tons of ideas for transforming your garage into usable creative space. I'm interested in turning a garage into an artist studio....lots of good ideas here.
2,Stick to the original,"This book reads like it was written by three different people and it shows. Plot is poor, character development is nil. Like the authors, I've wanted a sequel to the original for years but this one was a disappointment. I was surprised at the low quality of the writing. Examples: an assassination attempt in the middle of a play - before the assassin has obtained the information he needs. Or, a sudden switch to first person point of view for a minor character two-thirds of the way through the book. What were the authors thinking?"
1,Not worth a penny.,"Having loved James Schmitz classical novel (the Witches of Karres), I finally relented and bought this book. Alas, I could not be more disappointed. The plot could have (barely) worked, but the dialogue is wooden, not helped by a couple of jokes repeated a dozen of times over the book."
1,Reads like bad fanfic,"In the first few pages, the authors decide to tackle some ""mysteries"" Schmitz had left behind - and if I had had any sense that they had resolved them with what the original author had intended, I might have been pleasantly surprised. But their ""answers"" are so completely out-of-kilter with the tone of the original book that I felt cheated. And this tone deafness seems to pervade the book. If you really enjoyed, ""The Witches of Karres"" - stay away from this purported sequel."
4,The Wizard of Karres- Worth reading,"The Wizard of Karres is a reasonable follow on the the original The Witches of Karres. The authors mostly capture the flavor of the original. It is a fun read, nothing earthshaking, but fun. It kept my interest. Slightly reminiscent of Circus World in flavor if not plot. I'll download the Sorceress of Karres as soon as I finish the hard copies of other books lying around, but there's no urgency."
3,Sequel to a Classic,This gets an extra star because it is a sequel James Schmitz's 1966 classic The Witches of Karres and it is good to see the old characters come alive again. I enjoyed this sequel for the most part and would recommend it to anyone who really liked Witches but it falls short of the original. The plot (which I won't give away as a spoiler) is a bit shaky and feels contrived. The main characters lack the charm they had and diverge from the personalities Schmitz built for them in subtle but perceptible ways. The minor characters feel cartoonish and two dimensional. You can see how the authors attempted to recreate the feel of the original 1960's space opera and I applaud the effort but I'm afraid they couldn't quite pull it off.
1,Rookie mistakes from veteran authors,"Fans of the authors' other books or of the original tale will be very disappointed by this story. It seems to me that these authors made a huge rookie mistake: assuming that the reader knows everything about the universe their story takes place in.There's no transition from the original story, no background information, and the plot just dives in with no real cohesive feel of the setting, characters, or events that occur. I recognized terms and names from the original, but it all lacked definition. Even the characters seemed flat and undeveloped.They may have been living, breathing, dissecting minutiae, and agonizing over the story for weeks together, but we haven't been let in on any of it.Oh well, even top-notch authors are allowed a stinker once in a while."
3,Light Hearted Fluff,"This is a somewhat simplistic, happy tale where the good guys always win. There's no real suspense, as any dangerous situations are resolved by Deus Ex Machina. (That is, something/someone magically saves them, every time.)When they tell you that a wizard's powers develop when needed, you'll realize that anytime things look dark, he'll develop some new power to save them.It's a pleasant, unchallenging read, which turns out pretty much as you expect. It's labelled adult/high-school, but I think that may be overstating it.There is some potential for complexity, as when the Captain worries about feeding one vatch on the body of another. This should be a severe ethical issue, but it's mentioned once, and never again. It's like one author tried to steer the book towards some interesting issues, and the others ran away from it.I've read both Lackey, and Flint, and this is not up to either of their usual standards."
2,Not Even Close,"No-one would call ""The Witches of Karres"" a great novel, but it was a true delight, a book I have re-read and enjoyed numerous times since I first stumbled across the original novelette in the early sixties. Sadly, the things that made it such a delight - the clever writing, the not-at-all-subtle social commentary, the humor ranging from deadpan to virtual slapstick - are absent from this sequel.One of the earlier, more easily pleased reviewers stated that ""some people live to find fault,"" which may be true but is irrelevant here. I am glad for his sake that he enjoyed it, but if you find this book a satisfactory follow-up to the original, I can only conclude that you missed most of what I loved and enjoyed about ""Witches."""
4,Not as good but not bad,"Ok, it's nowhere NEAR as good as Witches of Karres but taken on its own it's not to bad and it is sort of nice to see the characters live on, even like this.I thought long and hard before buying it but ultimately I'm not unhappy I did. You should think about it to, but probably you won't be unhappy about it (or buying it used or taking it out from the library) either."
5,Great as always,Love the show and slowly getting all the seasons. No matter how many times I watch these shows I still laugh. :)
5,Way Past Kool,Futurama is pure gold. I have all 4 volumes and the movie. I highly recommend this for anyone who is a fan of the series.
3,Good but one problem,"First let me say something straight off. I consider Futurama to be one of the funniest and finest cartoons ever made, and a travesty that it was canceled. However the problem with this that made me give it three stars is that there are problems with the animations. Sometimes people's arms while skip around without pausing, so its not the DVDs. This seems to have never happened in the other seasons."
2,Dissapointing,"These cartoons are written in such a way so as to express all manner of humor, base or otherwise, with subtlety, and sometimes with no subtlety at all. Normally, Cartoons tend to express innocense or simplicity, these do not, let the buyer be aware, and let the buyer think carefully before purchasing these for children, as they may not be suitable for same given the content and portent. Other than the aformentioned, these cartoons can be very funny."
4,be careful,"Do yourself a favor and order this as part of a larger order (so you get a big box delivered), or the box may get crushed as mine did. The result was crushed cases on the inside, as well.Otherwise, content fantastic (I borrowed another set). I like that they have been good about including extras with their dvds.I'm going to return this case, but I'm getting another one!"
5,WOW WHAT A GREAT DVD!!!!! 5 STARS ALL THE WAY MAN YEAH!!!,great dvd man its sooooo good i love it and i will alwasy love it!!!!!!!!!
5,LOVE IT! They actually made effort to match Volumes 5-6,"Volumes 1-4 now match volumes 5 and 6, and I thank FOX for doing this, I love it. Perfect for collectors like me.Now if they can release seasons 1-10 of Simpsons to match seasons 11-14 cover designs! That would be awesome. And perhaps the 4 Futurama movies together in a cool design case!"
5,Go ahead and preorder,"I'm in USA, but I own the PAL / European discs of both seasons 3 and 4 and they are well worth it. I'm a little disappointed that I can't get repeat play to work for the PLAY ALL option.The quality is excellent and the extras are fun. No commercials and plenty of robots - just the way I like it. If you don't have a region-free dvd player, you'll have to wait until March 2004."
5,Undeserving Of Cancellation,"Futurama is one of the best animated comedies in history, in my opinion. Both smart and stupid people can laugh at it's content. The potent humor mercilessly pounds anyone into hysterical submission until they're overcome with comical joy. At least, that's what it did for me.A few folks might not be able to appreciate the science fiction-gone-crazy theme, but it doesn't matter to the rest of us because we're too busy enjoying the show.Volume three continues the series' impeccable quality. Same attention to detail, same incomparable sci-fi comedy. There are new audio quips given by select Futurama characters at the beginning of each chapter menu. They are a nice, amusing touch.My favorite episode: Anthology of Interest II. I wonder how many viewers understood the ""all your base are belong to us"" gag."
5,Futurama Video Series-on time gift!,Received the gift on time. Ordered in the last days before Christmas. Received on time. Thanks for the great service.
5,"Yes, its totally worth it!","Trust me when I say this, you will fall in love! With Bender, a trash talking robot who really just wants to be loved...with Frye, a victim of unrequited love...with Leela, a one eyed space pilot who never met her parents...and the rest of the crew. I can't wait for the new season to come out in 2008! The characters are real, the plots are engrossing, and the laughs just keep on coming!"
5,Highest Quality Available,"One heavy duty piece of equipment. Harder than it looks and I've yet to get the right form. Careful or you will hurt your back. Excellent product but must be used properly, which I don't have the muscle strength or training to do so. Use under supervision."
5,Durable and affordable,I purchased this item because I use a similar product at my local gold's gym. I tried to purchase a lower quality ab roller at Dick's Sporting Goods but was unhappy with the quality so I did a search online and found this one on Amazon. The overall price was good but the shipping was a little more than I thought was necessary. I have used it numerous times now and am very pleased with my purchase. I recently packed it in my luggage for a business trip I recently took. I was very glad I did because the workout facility at the hotel I stayed was substandard.
5,killer stomach work,Is as advertised . Great. And portable use it a part aid a multiple AB set . Very challenging and fun.
1,Horrible Company.,"The product that was sent to me was wrong, didn't even look like the picture at all. The picture posted looks bright red and compact. The one sent to me was maroon in color.. huge wheel and the handles were as long as two of these put together. The company gave me such a hard time returning it and acted like children. I would give it no stars if I could."
2,Pantera's approach to pole,"I'm surprised this is called POLE TRICKS 101 because the majority of tricks are very advanced. She's quite the amazing pole dancer, though I find her a bit scarey with those body tattoos, pierced nipples and platform stilettos. This is definitely not your pole dance as exercise DVD. (I would recommend the very thorough KT Coates 2 DVD's. Check her out at [...]). Still, Pantera is a pole phenomenon and I admire her athleticsm.I like the red arrows that show you where to apply pressure to the pole but the shots are often cropped too close and you miss important details. Other key pieces of info are also missing (such as how to get into an advanced pose before an even more advanced pose). And she doesn't cover transitions at all. Maybe we're to assume that'll be covered in POLE TRICKS 201? If there is one, I don't think I'll buy it."
5,ADVANCED MOVES,"This DVD offers some advanced moves that neither Pole Katz or A Pole Lot of Fun are prepared to teach. In this respect, Poletricks 101 is for the more advanced. The instruction is very clear and the instructors themselves are energetic and passionate. A quality production."
4,Great Trick video,this is a great video if your wanting to learn new pole tricks. it doesn't help you if you are wanting to learn how to get from move to move or transitioning from walking around the pole to getting to the trick.i would say this video is for someone who has got the basic moves down. it was great help for me as it shows u step by step how to do the ticks. the pause and rewind was my friend during this video. they do take some time to learn unless you are already good with your basic tricks. i watched the whole movie before i started my work out to me that helped me pick up the moves a bit faster.so this is not a first timer video. take some classes then buy this dvd!
1,Worst book ever written,"I hated this book. There was hardly a story line, the book was totally sex including female masturbation. Sorry, I don't read Harlequin Presents for soft-porn, I'm looking for romance. I hate this book so much it's headed for the trash can instead of the book swap or Salvation Army."
2,"Pretty, but not worth it","I bought two of the wooden broadswords only a few days ago, and outwardly they looked amazing. The looks are the only reason im giving this item stars at all, its nicely shaped with a glossy finish. While this sounds good, I expected the items i spent at least $50 dollars on to perform well. The first time striking anything besides air (a hanging punching bag) at about 10-15% power, the blade flew off just after the handle. If your looking for a practice weapon, I would suggest anywhere but here."
1,Don't expect to do any contact training with it.,"The one time the sword actually came into contact with anything, it broke. The part of the wooden blade inserted into the handle was very short and unstable, not to mention it was only held together with a thin layer of superglue. Buy steel, but more importantly, BUY FROM SOMEONE ELSE!"
2,Cheap and Damaged,"Usually when I buy something new, I like to put the first scratches and dents in it. Somebody beat me too it. This sword is cheaply made and will surely not last a year of training. The seller gets these from overseas and makes no apology for sending damaged merchandise. I would look around for a different seller."
4,Leather like,"This bible is leather like. It feels weird, but it is a decent price. The print size is perfect. There are title headings when the text is giving a new idea, which is great for studying."
3,Picture Misleading,"Could not locate the total ounces on the bottle or the picture and wrongly assumed, based on the astronomical price of $29.99, that the bottle was at least 24 or 32 oz. Wrong. Bottle was a mere 8 oz. I will not ever purchase this again. I would have never purchased this to begin with, had the weight been properly advertised. Way too much money for way too little oil!"
2,No vanilla coconut or milk,"This does not smell anything like vanilla, coconut or milk. I love all these scents and have purchased many products that are scented with vanilla, coconut or milk, and this smells nothing like any of them."
5,Inspirational,I found this book to be very inspirational. I've tried to lower my bodyfat in the past but after a few weeks I would feel deprived and frustrated. The Mind Body Makeover Project gave me several ways to identify how I was ruining my own success. I've been on track and getting leaner every week for the past 14 weeks! When I need extra inspiration I simply read one of the stories of the people who have followed Mr. Gerrish's advice.
5,Finally - A Brilliant Fitness Book I Can Use With My Clients,"As a Personal Trainer who truly takes a holistic approach to my clients' fitness and health, I have long been aware of UFOs (Unidentified Fitness Obstacles) yet never had a name for them or way to identify them. Michael Gerrish's UFO Test in this book is a brilliant and comprehensive diagnostic tool - in all my years in the fitness business I have never seen anything like it. I use this test with my clients and it is right on - and the beauty of it is that with the book, they have become empowered to take their wellness into their own hands and I support them each step of the way. In an industry that sees hundreds of books published each year featuring fad diets and workout gimmicks, 'The Mind-Body Makeover Project' offers a solid, strategic plan - adressing physical and emotional concerns - providing completely attainable results for real people to integrate into their daily lives."
5,A refreshing guideline for total fitness !,"This book is as close as you get to feeling that someone is working with you to obtain the most successful program for lasting fitness. After I took the test, to help identify my fitness obstacles, I saw my family practitioner to confirm the medical obstacles. Within three weeks, I noticed my energy was soaring and I had started to drop a few pounds but more importantly I felt better in all ways. But this book taught me to patient and compassionate with the journey. When I slip, I find it easier to get back in balance. The case studies and resources in the book round out the support or information you need when you take on overall fitness. It's the best thing I have ever done for myself!"
5,A revolutionary book - a must read!,"I bought the book with the hope that I would finally figure out why I wasn't losing weight. The UFO test included in the book really was my key to really understanding why over the years my dieting and exercizing were not meeting my goals. I also started using the exerices that the book recommends which has helped me to really tone up. What can I say, 2"" off my belly isn't bad in four weeks."
5,Thorough and Eye-Opening,"This is the most thorough book on the subject of diet and exercise I have ever read. Not only was the UFO test eye-opening for me, it helped me quiet those inner, critical voices that have always defeated my plans to adopt a healthier lifestyle. Even if you've never gone to the gym, this book gently guides you through each exercise, so that you are never intimidated. This is not a book that you will want to skip around in. Every section is great!"
1,Don't buy this book,"I bought this book based on the other reviews and I regret it. It's the same tired, hard to follow information as other health books."
2,Cute but not very durable,"I like this top, BUT the very first time I washed it (inside out, on gentle cycle, in my front loading Whirlpool duet machine) two of the decorative ""coins"" came off.I found one in the washer and one was simply gone.So, I was only able to wear this shirt once before it went in the Salvation Army bag.I would advise hand washing if you decide on this one."
1,Yuck!,"What a bad suprise! Terrible material & all of the ""coin trim"" is already coming off (before I wore or washed it). Save your ten bucks - this shirt is much cuter when it is a 1 inch picture!"
1,Kikit Women's T,Item returned because of poor sizing and quality. Would hesitate to purchase clothing in the future.
2,Hard To Use,"Bought this hedge clipper due to some features not available on competitive models. The option to extend the handle is nice as it helps balance the clipper better with the 22"" blade. You can also move the top bar to various locations, though I didn't find that to be much of a big deal after all. Cut through all the thick new growth on my hedge nicely.I hate the fact I have to keep one hand on the top bar and the other on the handle all the time to keep it running. There are switches on both and you have to squeeze both fully or it stops working. Try doing that for three hours on a shoulder high hedge. I finally got fed up after my arms went numb and put a velcro strap around the handle to keep it continually depressed. Never had this problem with clippers before. Nice unit but gave me more of an arm and upper body workout than I needed. I wouldn't dare use it on a large hedge needing a ladder. To me all the safety switches make it more dangerous - one is plenty."
2,It's ok as a novelty but there's plenty of better ones.,"I bought a couple of these for a ninja theme day. One for a friend one for me. I thought I could use it as a practice knife in the gym. I practiced with this for a while and to be honest it got annoying. Reason being is there's no balance to them. I get they're a practice knife. But every knife I've owned or used has some type of balance you can get use too. I've done kali, kenpo, shotokan some seal knife fighting techniques I learned while on security forces in the military etc. I'm fairly proficient with a knife. Other than your standard showing white belts how to defend off of this I wouldn't recommend this.On the plus side the handle is ridiculously hard and weighty, you can pretty much use this knife as an improvised slapjack."
5,Self-defense Training Knife,Purchased three for a class I am teaching; Quality as advertised; Fast shipping; Great company to work with.
1,Wasn't worth my money,"I bought two books on dog adoption, this book being one of them. I really didn't get my money's worth from this book. The tests that the author advised just are not practical. If people did what she said, no shelter dogs would ever get adopted. In general, other books on dog adoption have a lot more practical advice than this one. This book was not a total loss, I did learn a few things from it. But, all in all, it was not worth my money."
1,Don't understand how anyone can do these tests on a dog?,"It just isn't practical in a shelter when you go to adopt a dog, to do all those tests. I have also read that the test is not reliable at all. Some people have great dogs that failed the test. Other things in the book were very interesting. Like what kind of second dog to get. That made a lot of sense."
1,Do your research first,I've read some really very disturbing things about this author and her methods. So I would say that after reading them I'm going to pass on buying this book no matter what the ratings are.
2,"buyer be aware, this temperament test is controversial","Even in the hands of professional dog persons, the test has not been proven accurate. In the hands of a novice, your gut instincts may serve as well. In fact Jean Donaldson of the SFSPCA, in a small sample of 8 dogs, had a 75% WRONG rate. Dogs that failed went on to never bite anyone and a dog that passed wound up biting. Don't just take this test as science. It isn't. Notice that the author has referenced no other authorities but herself.It is an engagingly written book, and has much useful information, but the test is very, very controversial among shelter people and dog-knowledgeable people.Take it with a grain of salt. No, take it with several grains of salt."
4,summer infant monitor,"I'm really happy with this monitor. The volume is louder than other monitors I've tried (which I need, I'm a sound sleeper), there's no interference at all, there's no guessing when the battery is going to die as with some rechargables (I accidentally left the monitor unplugged and on for 14 straight hours and the battery's still good!), it's working just great. The only thing though, is sometimes the sound quality will get a little fuzzy around the same time most nights, and my daughter sounds possessed when it does this (her goo's turn into growls). It's not a big deal though, if I turn off her end and turn it back on it clears right up again. I highly recommend this monitor."
2,Feed back and annoying Hiss,"I bought this monitor as a replacement to a two channel monitor that I have had since my sons birth (2006). This receiver unit, even on the lowest setting, has a very annoying hiss. It is the only thing plugged into the electrical outlet, and I have moved it to numerous spots in my room. The distance it has to broadcast over is less than 75 feet. I would NOT recommend this monitor to anyone. Unfortunately, I have been unable to find my original monitor (new)."
1,Horrible Product!,"This is the worst product. Do not waste you money on this. The lowest volume setting is ear splitting, and the tinny noise coming out of it will drive you crazy! Do not buy."
1,bad quality if...,"First the big if: on my disc The best of W.C.Field including golf specialist, dentist and fatal glass of beer is not from PLATINUM collection but from DIGITAL GOLD COLLECTION. May be all the same.On the cover states in three big banners: Digitally remastered, digital 5.1. surround soundtrack dolby digital sound.All you hear is some far away voices and an irritating low fuzz all the time. The quality of the movietransfer is as poor.As we say in Holland: Buying Cheap is buying expensive!"
2,Disappointed,Was disappointed by the quality of this item. In fact the worst I've ever bought. Oh well...
2,"Not the Best Of, Just a Sample of Public Domain","These are a collection of the handful of WC Fields shorts, all of which are actually public domain at this points, so rather than buying, you should go to the archive.org and stream/download.You should really just save some cash and buy the collections. Sure, they're 40 bucks, but you get almost every WC Fields movie."
3,Not for the W.C. Fields rookie,"This is a bargain basement edition version of W.C. Fields' shorts. The production is cheap and the extras are non-existent. If you're on a budget and want to see where W.C. Fields was before such classics as ""Its A Gift"" and ""The Bank Dick,"" then this is a reasonable investment. But the film quality isn't good, and some of the prints cut off Fields head in ""The Golf Specialist""(I""m guessing that those shots didn't mean to cut off his head, but I could be wrong).I bought this not expecting much, and that's what I got. If you want W.C. Fields' humor it's here, but don't expect a quality transfer or any extras with the shorts."
4,Gorgeous houses,Beautiful pictures of a variety of houses that offer ideas for decorating for log cabins. It helps to allow thinking outside of the box. It shows that the feel of a log cabin does not just have to be the typical rustic decor.
5,Best Guide to Armenia,I volunteered in Armenia for two months and this book was an indispensable guide throughout my time in Yerevan and beyond. The photos are beautiful and the writing is excellent. I am looking forward to an updated version that includes sights from historical Armenia.Please don't be discouraged by those who have given the book poor reviews. They are looking at the book in a political context rather than as a guide book.
1,Poorly built,An Emei Piercer is supposed to have a washer. The washer is important. The washer makes emei piercer rotate without wobbling. Without the washer it can only wobble and makes the emei piercer worthless. DO NOT BUY this emei piercer.
3,Not bad,"its not a bad tool for $30, you just need to grease the rotating area and its spins nicely and also you can put tape on the rings to have better friction so it wont slip out of your hand. i say buy it if you want to just have fun, btw the tips are kinda of, ok sharp"
5,Beautiful!,I got this for my mother for Christmas. The box and ornament are beautiful and the recordings are wonderful. She had tears in her eyes when she opened it. The 3 CDs had most of the songs that she sang at Christmas when she was a child. It's a gret heirloom piece to hand down for generations to come!
3,Worth a quick read if you're a McLean fan,"Well, i think the title of the book pretty much says it all. The author Val McLean clearly states early in the book that her life has not consisted of the same stuff that made for good reading in her husbands book the Guv'nor. So if you're looking for all kinds of juicy stories about Lenny's escapades that you didn't read in the other book, you won't find too many. That being said, there are a few stories here and there that weren't in The Guv'nor, and it was interesting getting firsthand accounts from someone who was so close to Lenny. All in all, not nearly as exciting as The Guv'nor, but if you're a McLean fan it's worth a read."
2,Not what I expected,They were not at all what I was looking for. They're very plain and boring looking to give to a friend.
3,Domino Racks... Dominos only?,I purchased these racks to use on a tile game. Though they seem well made they would not hold all of the tiles needed for the game and the viewing angle was not good. They may be perfectly great for dominos (which I have not tried) but they did not work well for Rummikub.
3,cars toy,good durable product and my 2 year old son loves it and it hasn't fallen apart like alot of his other cars.
1,Kung Fu / Black Sash sold by Bigflysports,"I ordered 3 of these black kung fu sashes . They were 14.99 each .they are very very thin and not very well made .I could have purchased other sashes for 4.99 that are made a little better than these 3 that I ordered from BigflySports .In all these are thin and crapy made kung fu sashes.And I know what they are suppose to look like and feel like . I have a Black Belt in Vo Lam Kung Fu for over 30 years .Tish was to be replacement sash for my brother ,I'll have to sew all 3 of these belts to make 1 good one out of.the price should be 3.00 each for these sash. Its my opinion, Thanks"
4,Another Magical Work,"Exile's Return is the third book of the Conclave of Shadows series, and while it isn't his best work, Feist again takes us the magical world of Midkemia. If you haven't read the first two books (Talon of the Silver Hawk and King of Foxes), you will not understand the position Kaspar is in, so I highly suggest you pick up the other two before beginning.Feist's style of writing is unique to himself, and is filled with humor and wit, although sometimes it's difficult to detect. Exile's Return again shows us the former Duke of Olasko (Kaspar) on the continent of Novindus, where he was earlier exiled. Through this experience, he begins to understand the torments and sacrifices of the peasants, which he never contemplated while ruling from his palace. The ending of the book is quite mysterious, definitely leaving room for another sequel, which if you're a fan of Feist, you will eagerly be awaiting."
5,Great service,Received the trees quickly and they stood behind their product. Very satisfied and would definitely order from them again.
3,Leaves Seems Like Their Dying,"The I got the plant today, the leaves seem like their dying from the shipment. I'm giving it some emergency care to see if I can save it, two of the leaves were completely dead. I have it under a special light which acts like the sun. It's also in controlled heating at 80F.I suggest you expedite the shipping if you buy this, might be dead if you wait a week.Also, it seems like a second tree is starting to come up in the pot. I don't want to do any transplanting from the original pot until it's more healthy.I also have some organic fertilizer coming which I'm going to use on it.I'll update this review if I'm able to save it."
5,6 ft tall three months later,I received these in March. The plants were about 3 inches tall. Three months later they are 6 feet tall and the trucks are stout 6 inch thick. They look very healthy. I'm glad I planted them in the back of the yard by the fence because they will be huge soon.
5,Great service and beautiful plants,Kudos to Hirts! I have never been disappointd with the plants I have ordered from them. My banana plants arrived today and they were in great shape. I can hardly wait till spring to get them planted. I ordered from other nurseries with terrible results. I'll stick with Hirt's from now on.
4,Winter hardy Basjoo banana plant,The price was very reasonable. The plants arrived in an acceptable condition given the current wheather. One had no green leaves left but all are doing much better and growing after transplantation. Time will tell how winter hardy they are. Even though I'm at a zone 9-10 my current banana trees froze but some are already coming back. I had the same problem the year before. I want the trees for the hummingbirds since they like banana tree flowers better than any other flower or feeder. I hope this kind of tree produces good nectar and it does not get set back for months with a frost like my current ones.
3,Banana plant,Planted it on a pot and was doing well but with the heat in Dallas the leaves burned. I placed the pot in a shaded area with same result. The trunk is growing but unable to sustain the new leaves.now it is cooling a little and I can see the new leaves are faring better. I received the plant about less than a foot tall and now the trunk is about 2 feet tall within 4 months.
1,not recommended,I ordered two plants. They arrived earlier than expected which is good part. The bad part is one plant arrived dead and the other barely alive. I don't recommend ordering this size of a plant during the summertime. The plants can't handle the heat. I notified the seller of this and received no response.
4,More of the Same -- High Praise for this Band!,"SCOTS may not be the most innovative or experimental band around, but they are among the most entertaining. ""Mojo Box,"" the band's most recent effort following their five-star ""Liquored Up and Lacquered Down"" album, serves another big heap of guitar riffs and clever lyrics that is perfect for your next big shin-dig.A bit raunchier, a touch more rockin' than ""LU&LD,"" ""Mojo Box"" brings the goods hard and fast. With six tunes clocking in at under 3 minutes and only one over four minutes, ""Mojo Box"" tosses you from tune to tune, most of which come with SCOTS' usual mix of wit and double entendre. ""Doublewide"" is probably my current favorite track, but pretty much every tune is enough to get my fingers banging on the steering wheel and my thoughts turning to bootleg liquor and some Carolina BBQ.A great addition to any southern rock CD collection!"
4,One of their most accessible albums... fun stuff!,"A fine, fun album full of bouncy, hook-heavy retro-rock -- surfabilly, Southern soul, and a smattering of tongue-in-cheek country. The lead track, ""Smiley Yeah Yeah Yeah,"" lets you know where their heads are at on this one: it's a melody-heavy party record that doesn't take itself too seriously, and just lets the good times roll. The de-emphasis on white trash stereotypes and renewed attention to musicianship is most welcome, as far as I'm concerned. Recommended!"
3,A few good songs,Not as good as I expected from the sample snippets available on the website. Only ended up liking two songs.
3,I like it !,"Not as hot as I hoped, but still holds true to the Rippingtons sound.Let it Rip, IMHO is better....but I still give it a 3 out of 5.It`s a good one..The more I play it, the more I like it..."
3,Derivative and disappointing,"The Ripps have done some great things in the past, but in this album, they are clearly coasting. The music is derivative, less horns, and frankly, disappointing. If it didn't have their name on the front, I wouldn't know whose music this was -- looks like they have gone for the money. This is the best elevator music I've heard in a long time, but it doesn't fit the definition of jazz in any way . . ."
3,happy anniversary,"happy anniversary to the rippingtons. i've been a big fan since the beginning. got all of their cd's and even some of their merchandize because of bill mayer's jazz cat. i was expecting more of this latest release but got less than i hoped for. i loved the previous ""wild card"" album. nonetheless, there are tracks which stand out the most according to my opinion. listen to ""costa del sol"", ""eternity"", ""twenty"", ""a kiss under the mooonlight"" and medley tracks of previous hits. it's good to know that some of the previous personnel made themselves available for this album. tony morales, steve reid, jeff kashiwa, brandon fields, david benoit, kirk whalum, dave koz, jimmy ""flim"" johnson et al lent their talents to make this release more meaningful. where's kenny gorelick? i also the appreciated the inclusion of the retrospective dvd despite it's brevity. how about releasing a dvd of the ""live in l.a."" and ""live across america"" albums?"
1,The Rippington's 20th Anniversary,This particular copy had the DVD disc missing. Got a new copy sent
3,Volume levels of songs different,The music is great. Most but not all of the time I am asleep before the first song ends. But if I am not when the rest of the songs play the volume is to low for what I have set for a comfortable level for the first one. The first one seems to play louder than all the others. I noticed the same thing when listening to the samples here. This does create a problem for me. I am not listening with headphones. Maybe that makes the difference. If I had a CD player with a remote maybe I could turn up the volume if I wasn't asleep after the first song. Really do love the music. It is very relaxing.
4,Pachmayr Presentation Grips,"These grips cushion the back strap of the Ruger Redhawk. While it may appear that the grips are quite larger, they fit my average to smallish hands well. They definitely temper the recoil shock in a good way. I recommend them.One note: With Pachmayr grips I have been irritated by their tendency to have a significant separation in the front of the grips where the ""halves"" come together under the trigger guard. I have remedied this by using LockTite Flexible and shock resistant formula to adhese the parts. It lasts, is neat, and can be cut and re-adhesed for removal and cleaning."
4,great cd,My husband and I used this CD during labor. It was peaceful and helped set the mood for a wonderful experience. I would recommend this CD for anyone who enjoys meditative or spiritual music.
5,beautiful,"I am also a Deeksha giver, as are the musicians who created this beautiful CD. The music is a perfect background for the giving of the Deeksha, or Oneness Blessing as it is now called. Thank you."
1,Wasn't what I expected,"I bought this as a package thinking it would be nice background music for reading the book. Instead it was filled with music devoted to Eastern gods. While this might be nice for folks inclined as such, I was hoping the concept of ""oneness"" would turn out to be more omnifaith in its approach rather than dedicated one expression of faith. I guess ""oneness"" means one style - not an integration and harmony of East and West, but just East."
4,A well built and easily installed product,"A good deal and a good product. The price was a little more than some of the other USB 2.0 pcmcia cards, but this was an easy install. Actually, plugged it in - added the power from USB port and re-booted - it worked fine. Didn't even need to add drivers (Win XP SP2) or use the enclosed cd. The transfer rate is noticably faster than the USB 1.1"
5,Uncle Willy's Tickles,"This gentle and reassuring book does an excellent job of helping children delinate personal space and the fact that children can control who touches them and how much. Kyle is tickled more by his Uncle than he wants to be. Different from many books that discuss touching in unwanted places, this book allows Kyle to tell his Uncle that he loves him but doesn't like his tickling. An empowering book for any youngster who is learning their place in the world."
5,The Instant Dominican Republic guide is GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The Instant Dominican Republic guide is really nicely written.The guide is small and easy to carry around.The book features fast facts,top sites, great photography,background of the country,travel tips,and essential contact numbers. The guide was very helpful and the information in the guide is good to know.Anyone going to the Dominican Republic could use this guide book.Its great!"
1,Not even close,"I bought this book for my father shortly after his diagnosis. What a mistake! It frightened us all unneccesarily. What he went through was nothing like what Mr.Korda experienced. I realize that every man will have a unique and different experience. That said, I have to say my father is doing quite well at two weeks post surgery. He has been relatively pain free for 10 days and recouperating nicely. This book would have been funny to read AFTER surgery, but by no means should it be read in those scary, dark days after you have been diagnosed. It will cause alot of anxiety and stress. From all I can gather, many men do really well after surgery. Don't let your love one read this book. It is one man's extreme experience."
1,Tells more about Korda than about prostate cancer,"Unless you are especially interested in Michael Korda, I strongly agree with those other reviewers in recommending that you DO NOT read this book before you decide on treatment or before you have surgery. The author of this book is a very sad case and far worse off than most opting for surgery. This book is worth reading AFTER surgery and you have begun to recoup a little. You'll at least feel good that you're not as bad off as this self-centered schmuck.For good personal accounts of surviving prostate cancer read Bert Gottlieb's and William Martin's books. Both of these books are deeply reflective and filled with hope and useful information. Also Robert Young's Phoenix5 web site has very useful personal accounts."
4,Very nice teaching resource,"I love the quality of this product!! The pieces are nice and big and very bright. We bought it to use it for our church preschool Sunday curriculum.My one negative comment is that the names of the ""Fruit of the Spirit"" (love, joy, piece) are printed onto the different baskets of fruit... i.e. Oranges ARE Gentleness! I would have prefered having separate name plates with each ""Fruit of the Spirit"" so that I could assign a fruit to it (since I want to use peaches which bruise easily to talk about gentleness). The blank name plates that are provided are a bit big to cover the ""names"" on the smaller baskets. If the baskets were not named, I believe the product would have wider appeal since ""non-religous"" groups could use it too just for teaching about different fruit, or just decoration."
5,Khushwant is the man,"Like Train to Pakistan, this book explores a side of Indias history that was very very painful. It is a towering achievement in storytelling, and is a compulsively readable book. Khushwant Singh is a well known Delhi based journalist who views India with an unflinching eye, and populates his stories with utterly believable characters and situations.There is much tragedy, and much humour throughout the book. Do not be surprised if you shed a tear reading this one."
2,"Not really ""Heavier Weighted""","It works but I am gonna have to buy another one.I was looking for sort of a heavy duty jump rope but this product,only handles were heavier not the rope itself...so if you are looking for heavy jump rope, this is not the one. I didn't like it at all."
2,A Little Mistake!,"Yes, this film falls flat and certainly does not do justice to the original ""Lord Edgware Dies"". What's more, there is a significant mistake that was not in the novel or the TV series adaption. Has any other Christie fan spotted it? If you recall the story, the impressionist Carlotta Adams writes the last letter to her sister excitedly revealing that somebody payed her to impersonate Jane Wilkinson. Piorot eventually deduces that a middle page is missing and one word slightly altered in order to hide the identity of Carlotta's employer. So far so good. But then in the Ustinov version her letter ends: ""..Anyway I'm visiting Lord Edgware tonight as Jane. Will let you know how it turns out"". In the novel the letter says no such thing. And that is the whole point. Anyone who remembers the plot will realise this is precisely what Carlotta would NOT have written. Does anyone agree? But more to the point - given the soulless style of the movie - does anyone care?"
2,Read the book instead,"I am a big fan of movies from Agatha Christie stories, but I must say that this adaptation was not one of the better ones. Peter Ustinov has played Poirot well in the past, especially in Death on the Nile and Evil Under the Sun, and even in Appointment with Death. This movie, however, inexplicably places Poirot in the 80's, thereby defeating a lot of the appeal of these other films. Ustinov himself is still likable, but the supporting players seem out of place and halfhearted in their acting. The story is actually quite good, but it is much too difficult to look past the mediocre acting to enjoy it. Christie fans would be better off simply reading the book or watching David Suchet in another version of the story, called ""Lord Edgware Dies."""
1,'Thirteen At Dinner' will make you rush for dinner!,"Horrible! Completely and utterly horrible! Horribly horrible!!Why did they make this movie? For passing time? Wouldn't they rather have read a book, or gone jogging?-->The negative aspects:1. A cabbage placed in place of each actor, would have acted more impressively!2. The sound recording makes you wonder why silent films are catching on again!3. The dullness and dreariness are very genuine!4. The music (meant to be eerie and have a mysterious air) really makes one scream...for other reasons, though!5. Peter Ustinov (!)6. The sets are very convincing...convincingly lousy!7. The plot has been shown so clearly that one could easily mistake this movie for Bambi! (no offense meant for Walt Disney).Please note: This list could continue endlessly!-->The positive aspects:1. A true depressent for one in extremely high spirits!"
1,Don't buy this item ever!,"Worst thing you can do is buy this half protector which doesn't even protect at all!! it fits on the psp screw openings but that's the only thing it does right, it doesn't protect except partially the screen, the back and the sides of the psp are not coveres or guard against anything, don't waste $10 on this, spend a little more and buy something that covers the psp completely for $15 or $20 ."
5,"Beautiful Illustrations, Captivating.","I am biased - I got this book from my Dad as a boy - and it really made an impression on me. Ran into it on Amazon, and got it - and I am NOT disappointed with what I remembered about the book - fabulous drawings! I love having this book back"
5,Excellent!,Eric Sloane does an amazing job melding the text from the diary with the lifestyle of an American farmer in 1805. His in depth knowledge of tools and ways of the past gives a complete picture of life on the Blake farm. My son and I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Well done!
2,Not what I expected,I read the other reviews before I bought. I guess this wasn't for me. I love diaries but this wasn't really a diary.
4,Pioneer Life in the early United States,"I had this book in an earlier edition (1970's?) and found it delightful. As a boy I pored over the text and line drawings to learn how farm life was 150 years hence (I grew up on a farm). The knowledge of the means of labor and variety of tools which were crafted and used has been with me since, and it is interesting to see some of those tools in antique stores and know exactly how they were used. It also has given me great insight into how my ancestors settled the regions were they made their homes, as my family history research progressed."
5,One of the best,"Somehow the sum of the story, descriptions of tools and techniques, and simple drawings adds up to one of the most compelling, accessible, and effective depictions of life in 19th century America I've every read. I came across this wonderful book while doing research for my undergraduate thesis over thirty years ago, I used it very effectively to teach high school history, and just last year I had a great time reading it with my 11 year old son. In all those years I have never seen it fail to engage and energize the reader, often compelling them out of their seats to try one the contraptions for themselves (the ink recipe works well). How cool is that!"
2,Better off with a can and string,"I bought this phone about three weeks ago. Out of all the cell phones I have owned in the past, this is surely the worse one yet. Do not waste your money.Negatives: Phone shuts off at random, will also shut off if you press ANY button twice or too long, picks up on every little background noise around you while in-call, phone key response is S L O W. Takes too long to get around it. Easily dials numbers if you do not have the keyguard on. Have to take a second look when disconnecting call to make sure the person is not on the call still (big woops)Postives: It looks nice. It has numerous games, icons etc. As we all know though, looks ar not everything.Next paycheck I am dumping this phone and getting something else."
2,Too technical and not practical,I was hoping that this book would help me create several evaluations for my training programs and I am sad to say it did not meet my expectations. The books fails to present in detail the requirements of each level of evaluations. Spend your money on another book with more practical guidelines.
5,LARGE PRINT,"I didn't realize this book was a large print book until I received it. I find the larger print very convenient when I am looking at the book from a distance while typing on my computer but it makes the book heavier. All-in-all, the book is good to have, especially when you are studying after a long day at work."
3,Great book ... Hard to Read,"The information in the book is great ... but the book's layout is hard to read. The large font causes many of the tables and figures to be on pages not relating to the text. Everything time I start reading it, my eyes get tired."
2,Product image misleading.,"The lamps have a very dull brushed on silver finish, not the shiny smooth finish in the picture. Also the base does not have a black finish on them either they are more of a bronze color. Overall very disappointed when I received them in the mail. The picture seems to be photoshopped."
1,Returned,"Returned item immediately. Painted poorly with a metallic look on plaster. Cheap, cheap, cheap. the good news ia the return was easy."
1,This book could kill you.,"I was sickened to see this book even listed on Amazon. In 1977 my mother followed this diet under a doctor's care and died as a direct result of Dr. Linn's diet. There were many deaths across the country in 1977 directly linked to this diet. This was truly their ""last chance."" Please do not buy this book."
1,UnSafe Diet - Please Do Not Buy,My Mother also died in 1977 as a result of the Last Chance Diet. Please do not purchase this book.
1,Unsafe Diet - Please Do Not Buy,My Mother also died in 1977 as a result of the Last Chance Diet. She strictly followed the program under a doctor's care. Please do not purchase this book.
3,Leaking,tried to install first time and there was quite a bit of leaking happeningeven with the teflon tape and wrenching. haven't made second attempt yet.
1,no change,I have a water tester - I tested the water for a reading before I inserted a new cartridge - I testes AFTER inserting and received the SAME READING - SEVERAL times.NOT WORTH THE MONEY I PAID FOR IT.
4,finally a clean shower,"My shower water has a lot of iron or something but the Culligan shower filter really get rid of it. I do, however, have to change it every two months. I don't know if that is the shower filter not quite living up to its promised time frame or maybe its just my water. I think it is just my water cuz I've never seen anything like this."
4,Great Addition to the Household!!!,"Straight to the point:Main reason I got this filter was for my baby amazon birds (parrots) as they shower with me. I notice a big difference in their feathers; they are more shiny and soft as there isn't any residue of chlorine when they dry.I have also notice the difference in my skin. My shoulders, arms (elbows mainly) and hands used to get very dry, but not anymore. I do recommend this filter t anyone with similar situations as mine, or purposes.Oh, by the way....it is very easy to install.Cheers,"
3,good water,"I use these before. they work great, the only problem is they don't last the 6 months that is promised. with only 2 people using the shower and not long showers."
5,shower filters,The shower filters are exactly as advertised. They work wonderfully in the Culligan shower heads.
5,Filters out the junk,"This is a difficult find in local retail stores. Glad it's available readily online.The filter works very well. Takes out a lot of the chlorine smell and also the sediment in the pipes. It's not a water softener, so do expect to have that ""slick"" feel after you shower like you do with the big ""Culligan"" home based water softeners. Those are great, but cost $$$. This unit does just fine and would highly recommend it to anybody who has strong chlorine smell and old pipes with a lot of built up sediment."
4,works well,This filter cartridge seems to filter the water well. I could feel a difference and smell a difference. The cartridge lasted a whole year before you started to notice it clogging and restricting water flow.
3,Water power?,I am considering buying a showerhead water filter and wondered if Culligan's filters reduce the water power. Has anyone noticed the difference of your water power after installing the filter?
2,shower filter,I really couldn't tell the difference of having the shower filter on. I think our water must be pretty good. Probably would not buy again.
2,"Cartridge filled with KDF, not as good as carbon block by DuPont","This cartridge looks exactly like WFSSC0501 made by DuPont externally. Culligan uses loosely packed gold-color KDF which is used mainly to remove chlorine.DuPont uses carbon block, same thing used by Brita, Pur, GE in faucet water filter. DuPont's shower filter WFSS1050 makes the water feels clean, but Culligan's does not."
4,Very good filter replacement for Culligan Filtered Showerhead,"This is the replacement filter for theCulligan WSH-C125 Filtered Showerheadin chrome finish. It does a decent job filtering a lot of the water's ""impurities"" and excessive chlorination. Prior to using this filter set, my skin would feel itchy after a shower. This problem was alleviated by the use of filtered water in the shower, and there is a noticeable difference when using this shower head filter set. Our household goes through a filter every 4-6 months. Highly recommended."
5,Helps my sensitive skin,Good product for my sensitive skin. Keeps the chlorine in the water low. Actually lasts for months like listed on the package.
4,Culligan replacement shower head filter,The Culligan replacement shower head filter arrived promptly and was what I needed/expected. It fits the Culligan shower head that I've been using for about a year.
4,Good I guess.,"I can't really tell the difference, except I do see a cleaner bathtub that lasts longer and my skin is less dry. it is a good product, I have no regrets. Would probably keep purchasing it."
5,Great!,"I can tell the difference when I use this thing! My hair is softer than it was when I was not using it. The water is really crummy at my apartment too, so this has been a great investment!"
4,Major improvement - lasts 6 months in NY,"I hoped since I am a single household, taking maybe two 10 min showers/day this would last longer, which is why it's not a 5 star. But maybe it's because water quality was poor to begin with and the filter works hard. For a good price, I got 6 months of vastly improved water (single household). It will make your soap glide smoother, your hair softer, skin better prepped for shaving, less dry skin. Worth it!"
5,Anything that keeps my hair color to last longer works for me!,"I don't like the idea of city water's chlorine on my skin and in my system, I drink filtered water, why not filter what I shower in? Plus by keeping out the chorine my auburn red hair color lasts longer!"
5,Culligan replacement filters for showerhead,Definitely a good product. I purchased both the showerhead and replacemnt filter at the same time and saved money.
4,water feels good,"Filter was easy to replace and seems to do a good job... my girlfriend felt that her skin wasn't as dry after showers and I think the water feels good. The water pressure isn't as strong as before installing the filter, but it is still quite good... guess that all depends on the water pressure one has before installing it."
5,What a difference it makes!,My wife has extremely dry skin all over. We both suffer from dry skin on our shins in the wintertime. These helped tame our county water supply so that our skin was softer. This was the first winter that the skin on our shins wasn't itching and cracked open.
4,Works as advertised,"Replacement filter work as advertised, I purchased mainly to reduce chlorine level in the water. Reduced a lot of problems with our baby's skin."
5,Work for the ISH-200 as well,I've already reviewed the ISH-200 Chrome Shower Filter. This is the refill. These are a piece of cake to replace and install. No tools required on the filters I have. Man does filtered water make a difference. You don't taste that chlorine and who knows what kind of effects happen when showering daily in chlorine water. Lasted 6 months or longer for me. Definitely will buy more when my next 6 months are up.
3,Can't Prove This Works But NO Problems With It and Easy Install,"Point off for being waaaaaaaaaaaay too expensive. It is very easy to install and I would recommend it. I know you can subscribe and pay less if you commit to buying one per month, but it is still very expensive. I'd like to find these local and in bulk."
5,Culligan Shower filter,Works well and is a great way to maintain your hair color especially if you pay alot to get your hair done.
4,works wonderful,"This product is great to have. Here in Los Angeles you can smell the water, but after using this product I feel healthier and I can tell the difference in my hair and skin. Good price too! Cheaper than the hardware store that I was buying them from."
3,Just OK!,"Three stars is max for this filter, replacement filters are way too expensive and I have to honestly say I have not noticed any benefits from using it to justify its price."
3,Decreases water flow rate,I don't notice any difference in the water quality but do notice a difference in the flow rate. There was a noticeable decrease in the water pressure flow rate on both of the shower heads after we added this culligan filter cartridge. Our showerheads are different types and brands but both water savers.
1,bad buy!!,"the product is not like the photo, I think a lack of respect and honesty for not showing the product as it is, I will not use, it looks like nasty."
5,OralTonin,I use this product about 3 or 4 times a day. It has good refreshing taste. My mouth gets dry during the night and I fine this product helps with the dryness.
3,New version with sweetner!,"I'll bet most of these older (and good) reviews are for the older product without the xylitol. I really liked the older formula which I can't find now. I ordered more only to get the ""new"" formula which while not bad, is very sweet and I will not buy again. If you don't mind the fake taste, it is not bad. I don't like it."
2,Disappointed.,"Expensive and disappointing. Of course, nothing replaces good oral hygiene, brushing, flossing and used of antiseptic mouth wash, but was expecting much more in this product."
1,Died!,"I had mine for about six months when it suddenly died, with six months' work of video editing on it - the computer refused to see it. Went to LaCie, they said, ""Well, first we'll format it, and then..."" I RAN! Went to several repair people but no luck. Would NEVER buy one again - the hours of work I lost..."
2,formaldehyde?,"The mirror arrived in one piece but had three staples visible in the edge of the mirror. It also had a warning on the back that said it was made with ""materials that may contain formaldehyde which is a probable carcinogen"".I may return it!!"
2,Love it,"This mirror arrived 2-3 days after ordering and it looks exactly like the photo and looks great on my wall. It is a very nice and inexpensive, but elegant, piece of home decor."
5,Kudos! The best ever!,"I've installed 4 wireless routers until I settled on the popular Linksys WRT54G. I wanted a wireless printsever so I got the Linksys WPS54GU2 which ended up in the dumpster.When I needed more range I started considering changing my router for something a bit more powerful... enter USR5461.Not only did it take literally 1 minute to install and configure, but it also covered some spots previously no signal could reach.But the golden feature is the built-in printserver. In no time I could print my documents from across the apartment. Very fast.Con: For no known reason, it goes AWOL every once in a while and you have to reboot it.Other than that, it's the perfect product and I'll be on the lookout for USR products from now on. Kudos!"
5,My review is based on over one year of constant use,"I bought this product because I wanted a printer server integrated with my router, so that everybody in my house (sometimes up to 5 computers) could freely share a printer. I had already enjoyed such nicety with my previous SMC router, except that the printer connection was based in old parallel connector instead of USB of this router, and my new printer required USB. So I also upgraded my old router from 802.11b to this router which is compatible, but also supports faster 802.11g.So far my experience has been excellent. Almost no problems. Occassionally I have to reset the router (turn off and then on) to unhung the printer when there are printer problems (and I mean the printer, not the router). This is really minor and rare though, so I am very satisfied all in all...."
2,worked.. sorta.. nevermind.. no it didn't..,"This router was good for about 3 months. It worked great on my wired machines. The wireless worked great for MS machines, but my IBook wouldn't connect. I tried to upgrade to the latest firmware, but it crapped out and I had to send it in for repair. I have a webserver on the network and I couldn't connect to it locally. Suppoort said that the firewall wouldn't let me and there was no solution. I finally bought a linksys. Couldn't be happier."
3,mirror printing,"I set the unit to 192.168.1.76 and all prints came out mirror image. Customer support advised settings to no avail. But when I changed the IP address, it printed alright. However, I was never able to implement my automatic double-sided printing so I exchanged it for a Linksys PSUS4 which had no problem doing automatic double-sided printing and using any ip address."
2,I experienced problems...,"My old Robotics wireless router (USR8054) works better than this newer model. My old system had two antennas, this one only has one. Not sure if that's the reason. All I know is I tried this MAXg and it could not transmit through my home's plaster walls as well as the older model I have. It's probably OK for those with sheetrock walls and without steel beams/studs."
5,"Great router & print server, easy set-up!","If you are looking for a router with the latest in security, extremely easy set-up, and a print server for a reasonable price...then stop looking and buy this router. It does what it's supposed to do...sends a good wireless signal, allows up to 4 wired connections, and serves as a print server (works fine with my Canon i860). If you are somewhat technically challenged, and just want a wirless router that you can plug in, follow the set-up and then forget about it...this one is for you. Now I do have to discourage you from also purchasing the matching USB wireless adapter...the software that comes with the USB adapter is cumbersome and locked up my computer."
1,A Pain toUse,"I have owned this product for several months now. I have to go through a stupid step to use it. I was having a really hard time getting connected to the Web after I hooked up this router. I finally figured out a fool-proof way. I have to turn on my laptop and let it boot up. Then I have to walk over to the router and unplug it on the back of the unit and wait about 30 seconds. I then plug it back in. After a minute or two of waiting, I then get my wireless connection to the Web. How dumb! I should have returned it, but waited too long (guess I was hoping for a miracle). If I buy another router, it won't be this brand."
4,"The best sober, non-partisan text on the historical Jesus","Unlike other hyped up works on the ""historical Jesus"", Meier's series makes no sensationalistic theses. Instead, it soberly weighs the available evidence and reaches measured, tentative conclusions after a detailed review of the background of biblical scholarship. Although this is not a best-seller formula, it does make for what is perhaps the best introduction available to historical Jesus scholarship. Perhaps its one weak point is that so much material is considered of interest to specialists and relegated to footnotes, that the reader finds himself going through each chapter twice: once in the body of the text, and once in the endnotes"
1,Don't bother! It's gonna hold up the end of my nightstand.,"It never ceases to amaze me when non-Catholic apologists, hostile ones at that, believe they know Catholicism better than practicing Catholics. James White begins by presenting what the Catholic Church claims as its position and then tells us what it ""really"" is(according to him of course). Worst of all his tone is sometimes condescending and often outright offensive. He never mentions the Protestants he is at odds with, say Martin Luther on the True Presence or even R.C. Sproul. He appears well versed in the Church fathers and early church history, but somehow he is at odds with just about every historian(non-catholic ones) I've ever read. Go right to the source. The writings of the Church Fathers are readily available as is the catechism of the Catholic Church."
1,total waste,"This book is a total waste. The author has been refuted and demolished by average Catholic scholars. His arguments are illogical, self-refuting that uses a lot of circular reasoning.If you are fair google: catholic-legate and see for yourself how his arguments fell short, really short!"
3,something lost in translation,"The statements of Epicurus as translated are like onfucius say\ bumper stickers,or greeting cards, carefully selected aphorismsI found very little to make me exclaim 'This is why we still read him. Unlike Lucretius and 'The Nature of Things.'I keep asking, :How much of this is really Epicurus and how much Victorian bowdlerising."
2,JUST BORING,"EXCEPT FOR TWO OR THREE PAGES,TO MY MIND IT IS A TOTALLY BORING BOOK.I CAN NOT FIND ANY MORE WORDS TO MAKE IT UP TO TWENTY."
3,"Coming from a Jesco fan, it's just ok...","I was so pumped up to see this! I've been a Jesco fan for years. I thought the soundtrack wasn't very fitting. This documentary is incredibly sad. I was hoping for something very artistic and nostalgic. It was neither. Still interesting, though. The bonus footage is good."
3,Interesting to say the least,"One very interesting and captivatingly entertaining documentary. I would not recommend letting children under the age of 17 watch it though. There is alot of drug use, foul language, and talk of violence. But, it in a weird way, the documentary shows how family sticks together."
5,"Wild, Wonderful and what the...!?!?","I had to watch this documentary twice just to be sure....""did I REALLY just see and hear that??"" I can't explain the Whites...you just have to experience them for yourself. They are disarming, disrespectful, disturbing, and strangely entertaining. At any rate, this documentary will not disappoint!"
1,An embarrassment to West Virginia,What a wasted effort. Why someone would choose to film the nastiest white trash family they could dig up is beyond me. These people are an embarrassment to my beautiful home state.I hope CPS takes the rest of the innocent children from these people before the next generation is ruined.
1,Despicable and Not Funny At All,"Many people think this film/documentary is hilarious, but I disagree. The Whites are a poor excuse for human existence. They should all be in prison and the children should be protected by family services. This film was not entertaining, it was not eye opening, and it surely made a mockery of the poor people of the US. It gives the under privileged a bad name, especially those who are trying to live a decent law abiding life. Why are these people not serving life sentences? This film is not worth the time or money spent on producing it. I have no compassion for these so-called people, only for the children who are not even given a chance for a normal life. It makes me sick to my stomach to think people are getting away with this type of behavior. Wake up America; lock these people up and throw away the key."
1,Appalachian Trash,"As someone who has chosen to be a West Virginian, I find it interesting that I have known people like this in other places but I never see movies about the Terrible Taylors of Texas or the Wiked Witches of Salem, Mass. It is always Appalachia.I have seen everything in the oil patches of Texas that I have seen in West Virginia. The cultures are very similar."
1,A Gross Misrepresentation,"I can't even get through the first 10 minutes with out boiling over with fury of the representation of West Virginia. This is the prototypical use of the film industry to project a down cast light on West Virginia without real knowledge of the state history and culture. Juline Nitzberg picked the shame of West Virginia to document-from the person to the county. This is also a gross misrepresentation of ""the most famous person in West Virginia."" What about military leaders such as Stonewall Jackson, Actress Jennifer Gartner, Actor Don Knotts, Singer Brad Paisley, late politician Robert C. Byrd, and many more? If you want a real story of West Virginia research how we became a state and used our knowledge of the constitution to some what illegally split from Virginia. Want to watch a movie- We Are Marshall. It is my hopes that people will ignore this documentary and realize this was the film industries' way to make money."
1,Cant watch it,"AFTER placing the order, paying and downloading unbox player the website says that the VIDEO IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE OR RENTAL. is this what i can expect from Amazon? Pay for something then be told it is unavailable.The Wild and Wonderful Whites of West Virginia (Tribeca Festival Premiere)"
1,Description of This Movie Does Not Match It's Content,When browsing documentary section of Amazon On Demand library I thought this movie would be about a troubled coal mining family. The movie had nothing to do with coal mining families of West Virginia. It was more of a reality TV show that can be found in any city in America with regard to how these people lived their selfish lives. I don't know very many people in real life that act like these people.This movie gets a D- and should be pulled from the documentary section and put in with action fiction.
4,The Whites,"After seeing the ""Dancing Outlaw"" video in the early 90's I didn't think anything could top it. I was right. This video is very entertaining to say the least but it's certainly not ""The Dancing Outlaw."" At times during the WWWWV I was laughing my butt off and at other times I almost wanted to cry for some of the situations that the Whites have gone through. It's definitely worth a watch at any rate. This film isn't an exploitation of the family which I'm thankful for. It's simply a year in the life of The Wild and Wonderful Whites of West Virginia. Also, in the extras dept. there is a cool interview with Hank Williams III that is worth checking out and he's also in the film a little. Hope this was a little helpful in your decision making."
1,"Will The Real White Trash, please stand up","You guessed it, South Park should do a skit on these folks with their Pabst Blue Ribbon = I am White Trash and I am in Trouble. The White Family, as much as I wanted to love the heck out of them and their causes, the only thing I kept coming back to was the South Park episode of Pabst Blue Ribbon, I am White trash and I am in trouble. Some people just shouldn't drink or do drugs, and this unfortunate Family of Misfits has now shown America an example of why."
2,Not a block buster,This movie/documentary is pretty bad. Bought it for a relative living in WV more as a gag gift than anything. It was perfect for what I needed it for but if you're looking for a good movie to watch....this isn't it!
3,The Wild & Wonderful Whites of WV Documentry,"I am a resident of WV and I must say these people are raw, uneducated and crude! I've met or seen a few people that remind me of this family but they are a minority. The White family does not represent the majority of West Virginian residents!"
4,Scary People,"These folks are pretty frightening, especially since they are able to reproduce! The dancing is very good, however. This fact does not reduce the seriousness of the felonies they commit, though!"
4,I can't believe people live like this!,"Watched this last night with my husband and daughter. We come from a small, country town. This was almost unbelievable to me."
5,If your looking for some laughs and real life drama...look no more!!,This movie is a MUST see! Its packed with laughs and real life drama from begining to end!! Me and my friends have seen it hundreds of times and still cant get enough! Still quoting scenes from this film to this day!!
1,Pure Garbage,"About 30 minutes of this movie was way too much. Let's all spend some time swimming in the gutter. Nothing uplifting or enlightening here, just a pure disgusting waste of time and giving attention to those least deserving. The town Sheriff was exactly right, why not ignore the lowest of the low and give attention to the people from the community who accomplish something and can inspire others, like the boy who went to MIT? Why waste anyone's time with this garbage?"
4,An Inside Look,"An inside look at one troubled family, living in West Virginia. Funny, sad, disturbing, but captivating. Worth a look for sure."
4,Jersey Shore meets Jerry Springer on Steroids,"Title of the review says it all. If nothing in the title of this review appeals to you, you won't like the documentary. If something in it grabs you, for whatever reason (I guess this requires you to admit as much, even if only to yourself), you will."
3,i'm puking,i watched a movie called Deliverence in the 70's when i was a kid and now I know there are people like that in America. I bet that mongoloid banjo player in that movie was a White. Have anyone ever seen a family that is so ugly outside and inside in their life? After seeing the White females I can see why their men turn to farm animals. If your gonna drop out of school at 10 years old why even bother to go at all? I guess for the free babysitting. The only rational conclusion i see is all of them need to get sterilized to put a stop to their breeding process which is as fast as rats. I also cracked up at fat mama White thinking she is so tough when she is steps away from an old folks home. That being said I found it worth watching and sort of entertaining too.
4,Funny and Crazy,"Although I'm sure most people from WV hate to see people from their state acting like this, I happened to think it was a crazy and funny film. I find this movie completely amusing and even a little sad at select parts. Look forward to laughing, being shocked, and maybe even getting a little grossed out. Enjoy!"
4,This is life around here...,"You haven't seen anything until you spend a couple days in Fayette County, Pennsylvania. Even though this movie takes place not far away it pretty much sums up what you see here on a daily basis. There are many more family's just like this all over the east coast."
3,Odd perspective of other families in the US,"Found this documentary very interesting. I've actually known people like this in my life, and it's interesting to see the family dynamics and what passes for ""normal"" in the lives of others."
4,4/5,"I watch a lot of documentaries and though this may be ""White"" trashy, it's entertaining. Odds are, you watch this you'll lose a few brain cells. But its fun."
5,Crazy people but great entertainment.,"Started watching this on Netflix and couldn't take my eyes off for one second. This is probably the most dysfunctional family out there. I guarantee that once you start watching it, you will watch it to the end. Yeah, sure you may say ""Wow this family is horrible"" or ""I can't believe people really live like this"" but it's deffinately entertaining. I've watched it a couple of times and I must admit, I will probably watch it again. It will pull you in and leave you with wanting to find out more. Would love to see updates on them."
3,White Trash,Kind of an interesting documentary. It took me a while to believe that it's a true story. It's hard to believe that any family like the Whites would allow themselves to be filmed. But maybe it's more like reality TV.
4,crazy whites.,I find it pretty funny. There either stoned or drunk all the time.no class tipical white trash. Its great. Got to see it.
3,Redneck to the max,"The movie was funny but also kinda sad that there are people out there that actually live like that. NOT a movie for children. Raw footage of vulgar, drunk, and high folks the entire movie."
4,It was worth a watch and the avoid WV,"They are a family that should be avoided and not to mimic. They have a crazy life, even though it seems to be towards the end of their run of craziness. You start to feel bad for their simple view on life and the consequences it brings. It would be a whole lot better if they just stuck with the funny, and less with ""Real life circumstances"" West Virginia sounds like a place to avoid."
5,The Wild Wondwrful Whites of West Virginia,Very funny at some points but also sad as well.I can watch this DVD over and over. Love it.
5,Whites,Really enjoyed the documentary. Funny yet very sad at same time. Enjoyed the extra features also.Have watched it seven times with friends and family.
3,Everyone know someone like the White family,"I personally enjoyed this documentary and found some of it very funny. This documentary in not for everyone. One of the people I was watching it with said that she felt sad for the Whites and that she wasn't really enjoying the film, she said it made her feel uncomfortable. Everyone to their own taste, there are people like the Whites living in every state in the country not just West Virginia."
3,Real Reality,"In a world filled with fake ''reality'', this is the story of the decendants of D. Ray White and their family's tale 1st hand. Either you are going to like this real as can be Doc. or you will hate it from the 1st scene that you considered outside of the normal. This isn't a film that is family time worthy by any account but once you see it, it will stick with you. From drug uses to prison to a Cult Icon(Jesco White), this family has the ''there's one in every family'' as a whole family. I liked this film and commentary by members of this colorful family is Real. No make-up artist, no special effects and the film opens up and ends keeping you filled with a dose of Real Reality. See this film and if you like it, tell more people and if you hate it, well at least you saw something that wasn't a remake or imaginary. The fact DickHouse the guys behind JackAss were involved lets you know that nothing was off limits!"
1,Really?,Someone lock these people up. Im from WV and I dont know anyone like these nut jobs. The first dancing outlaw movie was funny. This is simply pure trash. If you want to watch ignorant people doing drugs all day this is your movie. Save some brain cells and watch something else. I am less intelligent for watching this.
4,"i would like seconds, please","my only complaint?? i wanted about three more hours of this, at least. more! more! more! i could have followed the whites around for 5 years instead of one. i am not the ""partying"" type, but i would party with the whites in a second. they truly are america's last outlaw family. my vote will always go to the underdog, and this case is no exception."
3,White Ain't Right,"This is a movie I was really looking forward to, a friend thought since I LOVE ""Gummo"" this would hit the spot. It bored me. Sorry, wild and wonderful Whites of West Virginia, I've been to snake-handling churches and rushed around to find bail money for folk and all your trash talkin' was nothing but. The Hank III segments were a nice departure, but as a movie or documentary or both, it seemed (IMO) kinda tame. I live outside of a town that would give those Whites shivers, so perhaps that's why I found the movie to be so bland.For those who've had NO EXPOSURE to the rebels in the woods, so to speak, this film might be interesting, and under the influence of a few drinks, even entertaining. It's YOUR call, Amazon customer! Open the door? Leave it closed?"
3,Interesting Movie,"I want my hour and a half back. Just kidding, I knew what I was getting into somewhat. Not a bad movie, I liked the Hank III music."
5,Sad and Amazing at same time.,"It's sad how people live, think and act. This movie sums up all three. Some may think they are wastes of life, which is probably true, yet they enjoy every minute of the way the live. And it amazes me that they can live that way."
4,"Fun sword, but not for competition.","I have been using this sword amongst 2 other swords for straight sword forms in wushu. The great thing about this sword is its lightness, you can swing this sword around extremely quickly almost like a broad-sword. It is balanced a little too hilt heavy so it balance right on the guard, I think most people used to wushu swords are used to blades that are more blade heavy. This sword is OK to practice with if you do not intend to compete in a tournament since this sword does not qualify for tournament usage under Beijing rules, this is why I use the two other swords most of the time for practice. I think this is a great sword for performing exhibitions though."
5,Cook Book,The book arrived very quickly and in the condition described. What a surprise it was to find a copy of this out of print book.
1,Copyright Infringement,This is David J. Marks who hosted 91 episodes of the television show WoodWorks on the DIY network. I own the exclusive licensing rights to all of the video content of WoodWorks Seasons 1 thru 7. The Season 7 episodes offered here at Amazon are a bootlegged copy which is why the audio is out of sync with the video content. This is a copyright infringement and illegal.WoodWorks Season 7 is well worth viewing when you access this product legally from my website djmarks.com.The legal version of WoodWorks Season 7 will be released by myself later this year. My edited version will have excellent production values which match the caliber of the woodworking content I present in each episode of WoodWorks.
1,Bootlegged Edition,"I have had the opportunity and privilege to work with Mr. David Marks. He is a very talanted individual and his superior work speaks for itself. This edition of his video being sold is obviously a bootlegged version because of the fact I know Mr. Marks strives for quality in every aspect of his work, including educational inspiration. Amazon is normally a trusted site for myself as a consumer and honestly I was very surprised to see that they would allow this poorly constructed copy to be illegally sold. Production by David Marks himself is always 5 star quality."
3,The sound is out of sink with the video,"This is a great woodworking show and deserves a higher rating, David Marks is truly inspiring. I loved the show when it was on the air so I jumped at the opertunity to buy the last season. But the sound dose not sink up with the video witch is totally frustrating to watch. I should have gone to davidjmarks.com first ware I was Abel to buy the first couple of sessions on DVD."
3,Much missed TV series,"I watched these all the time when they were on the DIY network. I am a woodworker and I have benefitted very much from David Marks WoodWorks series. Just like the previous reviewer the 3 stars is for the video quality, particularly the audio/video synch is off a good second or better. To me this is very annoying, fortunately on this show it isn't as bad as some because there is not much attention focused on him but rather more so on the work where it isn't quite as noticeable. It is strange to hear the table saw cutting before the wood contacts the blade. The show itself deserves 5 stars, there aren't many more shows like it out there anymore, none at all on diy, a few on PBS. The video issue needs attention, for a paid show it should be of higher quality in my opinion. I too wish more were available, Amazon only has part of season 7, David Marks has seasons 1 & 2 available on DVD or individual episodes on his web site but are pricey.Mike"
3,"Great content, poor playback","The medium rating is not because of the content, that is great as you would expect from David Marks. Minus two stars for playback quality where the words don't match up with the mouth. You kind of get used to it after a few minutes but with all of the excellent free woodworking video content available on the internet I want the shows that I actually paid money for to be better quality.Quality issues aside I really enjoy David Mark's show. I wish there were more available."
5,Me gusto,"Rápida entrega , en buenas condiciones, el servicio fue bueno ,no daños, en buen estado , ya no me acuerdo si llego a tiempo."
1,You Can Do So Much Better,Learning the few good techniques taught in this book are not worth having to suffer through all the anthropomorphic nonsense and overall ignorance of equine behavior and learning contained in this book. Do your horse and yourself a favor and get Equitation Science by Paul McGreevy if you really want to learn horsemanship.
3,Good for a beginning horse person,"helpful basic information. The tips and suggestions are good, solid information and very helpful. It would be a good resource for almost any horse owner."
4,Bad behavior correction,Informative. Knowledgeable. Detailed. A little difficult to read but sections have very good points and ideas for suggestions to try.
2,"Been there, heard that...","This book is a compilation of what all the Natural Horsemanship folks are already saying...nothing new and original here. I don't mind reading information more then once, but I like to get at least one something new out of each book."
5,Horse talk!,"This book helped my kids to understand how a horse thinks and how they can learn to think like a horse! It also helped them see their how their actions caused certain reactions with their horses! In all, we found this book very informative! :)"
2,"If you have never seen an aquarium, this is the book for you","This book is short. It only covers VERY basic information. You can get just as much information from the back of a fish food box. The book does have a short bibliography, but it list works by only three authors: Earl Schneider, Herbert R. Axlerod and Jim Kelly. Choose a book by one of these guys and you will be better off."
5,Excellent!,"We have this rice - in different flavors - almost every night. Put it into the microwave for 90 seconds, and you have delicious rice. It's not the cheapest way to buy rice, but it's fast and delicious."
4,"Fantastic, but don't overpay","I love this stuff; I eat it at work all the time as a default lunch if I don't want to head out. You'll have to try all the flavors to find the ones you like. Long Grain and Wild Rice is one of the good ones in my book. You can usually get this at Walmart and Target for about $1.60 a piece, so I don't know why anyone would pay the $45 for 12 that is currently listed here. It would be nice to buy a pack of 12 but you have to be competitive with B&M. At least with B&M I can vary the flavors in my 12."
4,Convenient,"While the product is convenient, I could taste a bit of ""packaging taste"" along with the rice. Having purchased 12, I hope it was just a one-time occurrence!"
4,Great speakers,"I bought these speakers to pair with a home theater in a box system for our master bedroom. I didn't want to have to run speaker wires clear around the room for the rear speakers. These speakers worked great right out of the box and I am pleased with them. They were the perfect solution to my challenge. I especially like the ability to increase or decrease the volume right on the speaker - in my application - right on the bedside stands. The only reason I didn't rate this product 5 stars was the fact that I have to turn them off when not in use, or I get a little hum and an occasionl crackle from them. That is not what your need in the middle of the night at the bedside. I assume it is from some electrical interference, but I prefer not to have to turn them on everytime I use them. Other than that, they worked great for me."
3,What now?,"I hooked the speakers up and the sound was okay, a little ""tinny"", but then I don't have a real expensive, state-of-the-art sound system either. I never could get the antenna and the 2 speakers to pick up the same sound on the same channel, but by then I'd thrown away the box. So I still have them, and have bought something locally that works. What now?"
2,do not work,"After two months both speakers stopped receiving signal from transmitter. Tried new C cell batteries (They need 16, 8 each) but each would not work. Hooked up supplied power adapters and still would not work. Also with batteries inserted the speakers are to heavy for their stands and must be held down firmly by one hand while turning on or off with your other hand. If you try to use one hand to turn on or off the speakers fall over."
1,noisy,"The wireless link produced lots of noise, even when channels were constantly changed. Any kind on a electro-magnetic field produced by refrigerators, dishwashers, or especially microwave ovens rendered the speakers useless. They produce a clicking noise when the path between the transmitter and reciever is broken, even slightly. I wouldn't buy them again."
5,Great Collection: When Recorded?,"I got this collection a while ago and have enjoyed it very much. However, after searching for hours I was unable to figure out when any of these recordings were made. If anyone out there has any information that can help me (and others) to place these recordings in Shankar's opus it would be greatly appreciated."
4,"The carp, the goddess, who's ""she"", la Grande...","Recently, I've had the chance to read this novel through an english class which has brought out many new perspectives within the novel. This novel shows the importance of family and the balance and equality between life. The conflict with the Marez and Luna can be referred to a ""Romeo/Juliet"" Shakespearian drama. One of the good aspects of the book that I found was interesting engough was the mockingbirds that kept on appearing within and between the lines of the text. Well, that's all folks. Also, to help you with the understanding of the text would be to discuss and ask questions with fellow classmates or family members. *sparknotes.com may help too.... (^_^)"
1,Very boring.,"In my ninth grade English class we have read this book. No one in the class enjoyed it. The dreams that Antonio has are strange and the writing is very bland, not to mention confusing before class discussion. I could not help being bored during this book. I would dread picking it up and reading for homework. I did not enjoy this book at all, Im sure many others will agree. It is not what I call a ""masterpiece"" thank you."
5,Very nice,This preset dimmer switch fit perfectly in with my six switch wall box. The 1000 watt made it so that I could use both of my chandeliers with out worrying about an electrical hazard. Easy slide and adjustment. Fast service too.
4,It's a light switch,"It's good and it works.I didn't give it 5 stars because I wasn't excited by it; it works and does the job..If you want a good dimmer, for a good price, this one works. I installed it in 10 minutes and it worked fine; 3 months later, and I haven't had any problems either."
5,Every singer should own this book,"This book is a breath of fresh air. Singers are a beaten up, battered down, ignored and abandoned lot. Nothing feels worse than standing on stage and not knowing what to do with your hands, face, body. Directors rarely help. Teachers make you sound pretty. This book gives you a strategy for looking good and coming across well to the audience. If everyone would read this book and pay attention to its message, opera would be far more popular, and would lose its reputation for dramatic boredom. Helfgot and Beeman have real wisdom between two covers. Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!"
4,Learn C# by example,"I have been programming for over 18 years and this is the bookI turned to when it was finally time to learn C#. The bookfeatures a large number of sample programs that are easy tounderstand. Each sample is followed by paragraphs that explainwhat the code is doing, line by line.The best way to use the book is to read a section, and thenbuild the sample program from scratch. There are a few instanceswhere the text is not perfectly clear on which elements to placeon the form, and there are a few errors in the sample programs.In case you get stuck, all the sample programs are avaiable(compiled) on the Deitel web-site.I give the book 4.5 stars."
3,Too much emphasis on console applications,"Wonderful tips, easy to follow, lucid explanations, BUT I would have given it 4 stars if the authors had explained the various concepts by using the Visual C# IDE from the get go. Who in blazes runs console applications in this day and age?"
4,"Good book, basic samples","Deitel's methodologies and techniques for teaching C# prove quite reliable. If you learn well with a focus on theory first, followed by examples - then this book is for you. My only pet peeve with this book is its duplication of samples from other Deitel books - how incredibly boring if you already completed the examples from another. I found the examples near identical to How to Program Java or How to Program C++. Note the programmer series for Deitel books do not include the exercise sections at the end of each chapter like the `How To' series. That said, it gets the job done for teaching in a reliable fashion."
4,Great bag,"I received this bag last week and can't wait to use it. It is a decent size to hold everything you need to spend a day at the beach. It's also a cute little tote if you don't mind people seeing what you have in it. I own many Pradas and this has to be the cutest one I have ever bought. The bag does have leather trim. Also, you can't beat the price for a real Prada!"
1,Plastic Prada bag: Plastic = cheap,"I actually sent this bag back immediatley after opening! I knew it was going to be plastic which was fine with me. I could use it in the summer at the beach or by the pool. But, the description said it was trimmed in geniune ""pig skin"" leather. When I recieved the bag there was no leather to be found on the bag. The trim was some type of weird plastic aswell. It was the cheapest and most fake looking bag I have ever seen! I couldn't believe that Amazon was selling this product for $200! I love Amazon and everything they have to offer! They really shouldn't put there name behind this product anymore. Any faithful Amazon custom would be shocked and appauled to recieve this on there front step! I know I was!!!"
2,Somewhat dissappointing,"The tip is a bit loose, and the horsehair was not put on properly and flew off as soon as I started training with it. That said, it serves its purpose as a training weapon, and I can put the horsehair back on if I want to use it as a competition weapon, so I didn't return it."
1,"It is a rip-off, you do not need this product for obd1","The check engine light came on in my honda 95 delsol, I googled on how to read the code and finally used a piece of small wire to read the code. When I saw this item on Amazon, I thought it would be some kind of electronic code reader, so I bought it, to my surprise the kit had a booklet and couple of jumper connectors. You can find all the information on how to read OBD1 coded just by googling. For honda and toyota vehicles you will need a piece of wire! The material value of this product should not be more than $2.00. I bought it for $25 which is completely rip-off. I felt I was an idiot to buy this product!"
3,Doesn't Work with ALL 1983-1995 Toyota/Lexis Models,"This product is not compatible with my 1995 Camry LE V6. None of the hookups fit any of the ODB ports - not even close. Read on the web that this was a transition year for Toyota.I bought this knowing full well that it was a (relatively) expensive version of a hot wire, but I was having trouble making my car blink the codes. If you don't like the hassle of stripping a wire and farting around with the ports, this could be worth your 25 bucks (if it works for you!).I'm returning it and am very happy with Amazon's return process, so far."
4,"Yes, I agree, too many language quotes","I agree with the reviewer below, entitle ""Translations Needed.."" I got really annoyed with the use of all the languages without any translations. This made for some awkward reading and points, and left the reader wondering ""What the...."", if you will. Also, a little verbose. Maybe that is just the writing style of the day, his cultural background, or whatever. However, his books are not a ""smooth"" read. They are extremely interesting and educational, though. I do enjoy them immensely."
4,A Welcome New CD That Rocks,"I thank the previous reviewers for recommending purchasing the 3-cd/dvd set at Wal-Mart for a few dollars more. I can't stop cranking this cd. The cd of new music would fit nicely with the mid-80s REO sound.The dvd is a well-mixed unplugged interview/concert for a studio audience, and includes terrific new arrangements of ""Ridin' The Storm Out"" and ""Roll With the Changes,"" as well as a few tracks from the new cd. I was particularly impressed with ""Dangerous Combination,"" which was co-written by Kevin Cronin and the talented Jim Peterik of Survivor and the Ides of March.The third cd is a 2006 live version of all of the tracks from REO's multi-platinum HI-INFIDELITY. A nice little bonus--I had never heard a live version of ""Follow My Heart"" before, and Mr. Amato does a credible job of replicating the one-and-only Gary Richrath's guitar solos.Definitely worth the money."
4,Great Fresh Sounding Record - Where's Neal?,"The record sounds good and has a fresh approach. The last studio record tried a bit too hard to have the old REO dichotomy of ""rockers"" and ""ballads"". This is different. And cool! It reminds me most of the Cow album (1976's album titled ""R.E.O."") in that the songwriting is very strong and the sound is new. What disappoints, though, is the mostly AWOL status of keyboard player Neal Doughty. He's on all the album artwork and plays on one song, but producer Joe Vannelli takes over all the other keyboard parts. Not that they're bad... they just aren't Neal. The included bonus disc (at Wal-Mart) of the live performance of Hi Infidelity is pretty damn good. It's marred only by Kevin Cronin forgetting a verse of ""Shakin' It Loose"". The closing song ""I Wish You Were There"" really shines."
4,getting better as I listen,"I am a long time hardcore REO fan, at first listen I did not like this album at all, the more I listen to it I am liking some songs better, some just plain suck. I, however, do not agree that Kevin Cronin's voice is shot. He has one of the best male vocals of all time. I'm not sure about Gary and Alan's replacement members-- those were big shoes to fill. Still a fan, but I like the Hi Infidelity era best of all. Good effort guys."
1,A failure,"I really like REO's older music and I was excited about this CD, but when I got and listened to it the olnly good song was ""I Needed to Fall."" The rest of the CD just isn't good. I suppose it's tolerable to listen to it, but there wasn't any other songs that I cared to hear again. Some of the songs I even hit the track forward button. I guess there comes a time in a band's career where they've topped out and they're not going to be able to reproduce their past quality. At least REO can tour and play their older music."
2,It wouldn't get any better than this...,"Please don't get me wrong. This album isn't bad at all.It's just not REO. It doesn't sound the same, it doesn't feel the same.REO is a classic and REO is all the fans wanted to hear. Somewhere, in a shaded distance, ""I needed to fall"" finds its way home and slightly brings back the powerful, unmistakable REO sound. But only for a split second and like a familiar face in the crowd, it's gone.It's an honest album. But maybe it was never meant to be recorded.With no computers, no fancy editing tools, the remastered version of ""Hi Infidelity"" is a much better choice for the hardcore REO fan. And it gets better every time you hear it. ""Find your own way home"" doesn't."
2,Working up to 3 stars,The more I listen to it the less boring it sounds. I guess after ten years since their last cd I really expected to much. Only the most hardcore REO lover could think this rates more than 3 stars.
5,Geat Album that should get more Airplay,"I saw REO's performance on ""Soundstage"" and was transported back to the late 70's and early 80's. The current band sounds terrific and their new album is Great. I particularly liked the title cut ""Find Your Own Way Home"" and absolutely love ""Dangerous Combination"" I wish this album would have more publicity because it is better than much of the garbage out today.Now I am not saying all of todays music is bad, but this album warrants much more attention and recognition. Its great to see Kevin Cronin, Bruce Hall and Neil Doughty still jammin together like in the classic days."
5,REO Haters,"The ""REO haters"" sure hate with a passion and with knowledge of the bands past albums and personnel. I think it's because they have a personal grudge with the band. The FACT of the matter is, this is some of the best work REO Speedwagon has ever done. The album is selling very well. People are still coming to see them play after over 36 straight years of touring. They landed their first charted hit in over 15 years with ""I Needed to Fall"" from this album. Fans of REO past and present will appreciate and love this album. GREAT job REO Speedwagon!"
5,Great machine for the price!,"I was prompted to purchase this because of the other reviews I read, and I'm glad I did. It was easy to put together, and it's a great, smooth rower. I've never tried a rowing machine before, so it took me a few minutes to develop a smooth rowing technique, but now it feels natural. I like to row while watching shows I've TiVo'd. It's quiet, so it's easy to watch TV while rowing."
2,Arms of steel,This product was great for about three weeks. Then one day while I was working I ripped the right rowing arm completely off. Good for my ego however I think the flimsy construction had more to do with this than my overwhelming strength!
2,"Great until it broke, twice!","I really liked this machine for two weeks. It's quiet and I got a great workout. Then it broke. So I returned it for a replacement. I really liked that one for two weeks, too. Then it broke. Both of them broke in exactly the same way. There's a weld where the arms are attached to the underside of the body and that weld broke on the left arm of both the original machine and the replacement machine. I don't know if it's a design flaw or the welder of the left arms is not up to snuff, but, fool me once, I'll get a replacement; fool me twice, I want a refund. Amazon.com has been great with their return policy. The company that made the machine has been unresponsive to my inquiries. So why 2 stars and not just 1? Well, I really like the machine for 2 weeks."
2,cheap rollers,"I found the rowing machine fairly easy to assemble, and seemed to be sturdy and well designed. I like the motion of the rowers and it is easy to adjust the tension. The problems came when I started working out with it. I weigh 170 lbs. and the first time I used it I began to see plastic shavings on the roller tracks. The seat still moved, but it wasn't very smooth. When I got down to look at why this was happening, I saw one of the rollers had fallen apart. The inner metal lining of the wheel had popped out causing the wheel itself to roll off kilter. I took the track apart to access the seat and rollers. I managed to slip the metal parts back in place. After I got it put back together and tried again, another roller did the same thing. I still have to contact the manufacturer and see if there are better rollers available. If not It is pretty much worthless as an exercise device."
2,Getting worried after 1100 strokes XXXX update now failed.,"no point repeating 100 reviews so just this.SEAT HAS BEGUN to wobble @ about 1,000 strokes. I am concerned this is a design flaw and not something I can tweak. This is after only a few short uses. I just hope its something I can fix easy.update to a couple of weeks later and seat roller has failed I cant use it anymore, so thank goodness I am still in the return window.BIG thumbs up for Amazon they really step up to plate, it means i can buy all sorts of things here knowing that for at least 30 days Amazon has got my back.If only I could buy this rower with perhaps 50 bucks worth of better hardware."
1,4 different parts replaced in first 45 days - 5th on its way.......have fun!,"I think I have spent more time fixing this machine than using it! Today, when the second set of rollers gave up [they get totally decimated, leaving dangerously sharp metal chips on my carpet], I called Stamina again to find out they are aware of the problem and are planning to ship newly ordered set of rollers - they DID NOT recall the product, though!Shock arrived damaged and was replaced. Pedal broke on third use and were replaced and a full set of rollers [now I will be sent another set]. Each time, I am supposed to remove and replace the parts myself, of course. Customer service is nice and helpful and parts are being shipped free and fast - but it doesn't make this machine acceptable."
1,Wheels on seat break off,"My rowing machine arrived yesterday. I went to try it out and almost immediately the wheels on the seat broke off. I called Stamina today for replacement wheels. The customer service person told me that they know there's a problem with the wheels. When I was telling my story, she immediately asked, ""Is this the 1050..?"" Many, many complaints about the same problem. They're working on getting better wheels, but they don't know when those improved wheels will arrive. In the meantime, they'll send me the same kind, though they're pretty sure that those wheels will break as well.My advice is not to buy this product until they have a breakthrough on the seat wheel issue. When that will be is anybody's guess.And I don't think much of a company that continues to sell a product that they know is defective."
1,Great if you can get one with all the parts!,"We bought this rower and used it for about a month before one of the black plastic foot rests broke. We contacted Amazon and they had us send it back for a new one. The new came with more than half of the pieces missing. We were going to order a 3rd one, but Amazon will no longer guarantee it if anything goes wrong. The prospect of having to deal with the manufacturer directly is a little too scary, so we will not replace."
5,well worth the money,I have not used a rower before and was quite pleased with this product. Glides very smoothly. Great tension for a good workout.Read the instuction through once and you should have it together in 30 minutes.I love the way the glider stores out of the way - any corner will do- mine is against the wall in a small living room.I had thought this item would be a little chinchy from the photo but it is well made and quite sturdy.
4,Very Satified,"This rower is great, exactly what I thought I was getting. It's a good workout - aerobic as well as a muscular workout. It was easy to put together, inexpensive, and arrived on my doorstep very quickly! It doesn't really fold up for storage, but it does tip up to get it up and out of the way. I find that I do need to wear sneakers in order for my feet to stay in the straps, but other than that, no complaints!Well worth the money!"
4,Excellent product,"Very surprised at how easy it was to put together. After reading other ratings I thought it might be harder, but was simple. I agree with other ratings only problem is foot holds. They need to be corrected. Everything else is very good. Moves smooth and is well built."
3,So-so when you want to row,"It's okay, not great, not terrible just okay. The resistance is a bit hard to judge sometimes and the computer is very basic. Set up is easy and the frame seems sturdy, though you have to check EVERY bolt before you put it together or you may end up having to take it apart just to tighten some bolts. For the price it's a decent deal for a home user, if you're looking for something a bit more heavy duty, you'll have to look higher up the price scale."
4,Good value for amateur,"I bought this a few months ago to supplement my WII fit and free weights. It wasn't hard to set up. I use it 2-3 times a week for 15-20 minutes at a time, works fine. Two minor issues, others have mentioned that your feet can come out of the straps, happened to me a few times til I learned to strap my shoes down tight. Also, if you get a little off center, the seat won't slide. For the price, excellent value."
4,Workout for the cardio and the strength,Only part about this machine you need to have to create a workout effect is perserverence. The machine performs endlessly and perfectly but do find a sweet spot for it to stand the remaining time you are not working out. It folds but needs a bigger space than your ab machine.
3,good for the money,"For approx. $100, the price on this rower can't be beat. It's a decent workout, though not as aerobically challenging as I thought it would be. Got it for Christmas, and the biggest downside are the miserable pedals that are supposed to keep your feet locked into place. They are just barely adequate, in my opinion, and in fact I tried to pull the velcro on the right side so tight that the plastic on the pedal broke. So after 4 uses I've already broken the thing. A call to Stamina's telephone line got me nothing but holding time, so I tried ordering the part on their website. That was a week ago, and I've heard nothing and received nothing. The bad thing is that with just a little tweaking, Stamina could make this rower the exercise deal of the century. Instead, it's merely pretty good for the money as long as it doesn't break and as long as Stamina replaces the broken parts."
1,No support,I ordered the Stamina Body Trac Gloder 1050 Rowing Machine approx. three weeks ago. The use instructions were missing from the package. I have sent numerous emails and made a couple of phone calls but have yet to receive any response from the seller.I do not recommend buying from this company!
4,Love it,"I love this rower. It's a simple & great workout. It took very little time to set up, and is easy to set up. The only ""problem"" I've had is one side of the seat lightly scraps the side (which is probably from how I sit) not to a point where is any problem, & if you put a little grease...like petroleum jelly, it guilds very smoothly. Given the price it's something I deal with. I also love how easy it is to store, being in a super small apartment its nice to be able to just put in a corner until I need it. Also I agree the foot rests aren't the best but it's not so bad that the rower isn't good.Over all I would suggest this to anyone who is looking for a good rower & doesn't want to pay a lot."
3,Not much Stamina Body Trac Glider,"I was dissapointed by the fit and finish of this product. The packaging wasn't sufficient enough to keep small plastic pieces from breaking off the handles and other parts of the machine. The machine it self is farely minimal in resistance, even at the highest setting. It takes some getting used to to find the right coordination and rhythum. My feet kept slipping out of the pedals and the velcro straps for the feet started to tear immediately after a couple uses.Other than this, it does help the lower back and keep the whole back and shoulders limbered up. I would recommend looking for a model in the next higher price range for better quality. You get what you pay for."
1,I wanted to like it...,The feet issue was a huge problem for me. It was all I could think about especially since there was basically no resistance. This is nothing more than a glidig seat. It got passed around my family until someone finally threw it away. I'd just save up for an actual rowing machine.
3,buy it?,its ok for someone that never works out... goes from levels 1-12.. first day I was already on 12..and about 200 rows... good cardio tho..
2,Confused,I still haven't figured out how it works! I am confused as to the direction and position my knees and arms should go.. in addition to that the foot peddles do not stay on or fit properly. It would have been nice to get a visual as to how this equipment should be used. I have never had an opportunity to row and I was hoping that this would be an alternate exercise since I have fractures in my foot and can't do traditional workouts.
3,passing grade but not an A,"It took a few calls to customer service to get the machine working. One entire assembly was missing from the original packaging, and the display unit was defective. However, their customer service was courteous and quickly shipped replacement parts at no charge.The rower itself, now that I have it assembled, is fine. I'm 5'9"" and haven't experienced any of the fit issues that other people have observed. The display is rather simple; there's no ""distance"" or ""pace"" measurements, just elapsed time and strokes (plus ""calories"" but there's no way that value is accurate.) I just use a digital metronome as my ""coxswain."""
3,Rowing Machine,"The product was shipped quickly and arrived in good condition. It was easy to assemble, however there was a broken piece. One of the components that connect the electronic read-out was broken. I accessed the company's website to request a replacement and it was shipped immediately.The rower itself is easy to use and works well. My issue is I have average size female feet (size 7) and my shoes pop out of the bottom of the foot pedals b/c the velcro strap runs across my toes. My husband bolted two pieces of plastic to the foot pedals so my shoes would fit higher on the pedal and the velcro strap would go across the proper part of my foot.It would be nice if the company offered the velcro strap to be adjustable to fit smaller/averaged sized/female feet. The machine is impossible to use if your feet aren't held down. It's obviously designed for a men's foot."
1,Missing materials and broken parts,"The product was damaged and several bolts were missing.When I tried to look at the pictures, my product did not match properly.Am very dissapointed, as I really looked forward to using this rowing machine.Boo."
2,"Cheap, Get what you pay for","At least it is functional, mostly.Bolts with poorly drilled tracks, one of the two electronics connections is stripped and missing the connector so the display will never do anything useful. However, it does mostly work, and is cheap and takes up less space than most machines. Keep in mind it is not suitable for a tall person at all. I should have gone with my gut despite the good reviews - I'd already returned a Stamina bike due to non-functioning out of the box. Too much work to return after assembly though, so oh well. I get what I paid for, I guess."
4,good machine,The only issue I have with this machine is that the foot straps are positioned to high for someone with average size feet. Both my wife and I have trouble with our feet slipping out even with the straps adjusted as tightly as they can be. Other than that the machine is exactly what we were looking for.
1,A Bad Decision,"The potential is there for this to be a great machine for the price, but since I have to try to force myself to keep my feet in/on the pedals, this is why I would never reccomend this to anyone. I wish I would have followed others that have said when they experienced the same thing because I would never have purchased this."
2,sturdy but not a very challenging workout,"I was hoping for a more challenging workout. This doesn't really do much for the legs, and while you can work up a sweat and raise your heart rate, you can't really go full out. The equipment can't handle it. The footrest straps aren't located effectively, so you really have to pay attention to your feet and even then they still slip out and you have to stop.Recently the piston seemed to lose some oomph, and I've only had the thing for a month or so. It doesn't provide resistance through the full stroke, but only through the latter half of it. I haven't contacted the company yet to see what the deal is with that.My advice; it's cheap, it raises the heartrate, it can be stored upright, it's a decent indoor workout, so it's probably worth buying if those are important attributes. If you want an intense workout, this isn't it. You might be better off with one of the flywheel types of rowers. Some of those are less than $200."
3,Almost pretty good,"I've been using this machine on and off for about 5 months. It's a little squeaky, but not bad. After 20-30 minutes, the range of motion of the strokes decrease. But I only use it for 30 minutes, so this isn't a problem. Once in a while, my size 10 foot slips out from the foot rest, but I just slip it back in while I'm rowing. A smaller foot will need reenforcement (extra velcro straps). The only reason why I rated it a three is because the piston just started leaking oil. I still have resistance, but I think I'll have to start shopping for a piston. But hey for the price and because I am a beginner rower, this machine is worth the money. If I can't find the piston, I'll just up grade to a better machine. Rowing is the right exercise for me."
1,not worth the money,"* thought it would fit under the bed from reading specs but it is about 18"" high.* about the 10th time i used it the right foot strap broke.* it also creaks* i would not buy it again"
2,less than expected from Amazon,"The machine arrived in a timely manner however, it appeared to be a returned item as the packaging was damaged and had lots of tape on it. The pieces were thrown in the box. The display mount was bent but not enough to warrent the hassle of a return. The overall machine function is fair, the display operation is not well thought out(no on/off). All in all, having dealt with Amazon for a number of years, I really expected more."
4,"great value, great workout","love my rower! i've had it for about a month, and with almost daily use, here's what i've noticed:pros:* easy to assemble. took less than an hour, by myself.* great price* doesn't take up much space - i've never bothered to fold it up.* doesn't require power - it can be used even if you don't put batteries in the computer monitor thing.* offers plenty of resistance. i've used it for faster rowing (for cardio) at lower settings, and i've cranked it up to level 9 for a harder workout. there's a definite difference, and you'll feel it.cons:* the pedals are worthless. i removed them, and just stick my toes under the bar.* the rower arms are a bit creaky during use. is a bit annoying, but performance is not affected.* the computer monitor thing is kind of useless, other than when using it as a timer.all in all, i'm REALLY glad i took a gamble & made this purchase. provides a great workout, without any impact."
3,Cheap parts ---> Assembling the product is a pain.,"The product as such is great. Assembly is a pain though because of the cheap parts provided. I had trouble unbolting one of the bolts from the ""machine"". (yes, I know I was just unlucky, but this is my review. =) )5 stars for the product and the way it works.3 for the extremely cheap parts - bolts, nuts etc.Also, if you are shorter than 5'10"", this product isn't for you, because you wouldn't really gain much from moving a few inches on the bench (I'm 5'8"", and I honestly don't think this machine would work for me) .You would expect better quality for something that has such great reviews."
2,"Decent exercise, PLEASE Replace Footing Design!!!!","Out of the box and after setup this is a really good workout, Im sweating right now, but I would have a MUCH better workout if I could keep my feet in the straps.EVERYONE will have a problem keeping their feet in the steps, so these people need to get this fixed, the heel backing needs to be raised. I will have to put holes in the plastic to get it fixed, and that is very upsetting.Obviously a product these guys didnt test very long before mass producing, and thats boneheaded."
3,you get what you pay for,"baseically works as advertised but the METS generated is about half what a gym level rowing machine allows.the movement is smooth and easythe feet holders do not work well: having your foot slip out all the time is irritatingbut for the preice, hard to complain"
4,A great value. Hard to beat for the money.,"Overall, I really like the rower. Years ago, I had a Precor rower that was much more expensive and really was more limited than the Stamina rower. But, like many reviewers here at Amazon, I also had an issue with my feet falling off the pedals. I liked the solution of one reviewer, Johnny-X, who drilled holes in the pedals at the base and put a U-bolt through to keep your heels from slipping off. But, I also wanted to be able to use the rower in my stocking feet, so the U-bolt was not an option. As I was at Lowe's looking for a sturdy, but flexible material to attach to the pedals, I found some Vinyl siding samples in the lumber section. I grabbed a few and saw that they'd fit the pedals well. I attached them with rivets, but you could use small screws and nuts. The photos are in the gallery. My only other modification was to remove the cheesy graphics which really made the unit look better, in my opinion. Overall, I'd strongly recommend this rower."
2,"Good, when it works.","Like many others here, I was looking for a cheap and easy rower. This one seemed to win, so I took the plunge.The good:Assembly was very easy, it is relatively light, and can stand and fold up to minimize floor space when not in use. Computer keeps time and strokes accurately, but I don't really trust the calorie counter.The bad:Seat is pretty hard and uncomfortable. Footstraps are next to useless (take an old pair of sneakers, pull out the insole and drive 3-4 screws through the shoe into the footpad. Replace the insole, lace up, and you'll never slip out again!).The dealbreaker:After only a few months of use, one of the wheels has broken clean in half. It is currently useless as the seat will not move while I'm sitting on it. I'm still looking for a replacement."
4,"OK, not great quality..","For the price it's good, but it is just that, a cheap rowing machine. But I have used it daily nor for almost a month. and so far it takes the beating well"
4,Thumbs up!!,"Overall a great product. I could of used a bit more resistant while rowing. I would recommend this to someone who is not quite sure whether or not you will get a good workout with the Trac Glider. I am just getting back into exercising once again, and this was very easy to get started on."
3,"It's ok, i just wished it had more resistance on the legs maybe that would get the heart rate going :/","Go this machine yesterday ..it had everything inside, simple to assemble...but idk it just didn't really get my heart pumping and me sweating , I'm think about putting some resistance bands on the seat maybe the workout would be better..i would only recommend this to older folks because it's a easy workout"
1,Terrible Quality,The rowing machine took about 20 minutes to put together and it looked pretty cool. I decided to test it out right away and around rep 400 the wheels started making a terrible scraping noise below my seat. Then the wheels started to bind up and some wouldn't spin at all. The resistance level also wasn't as great as I expected. I was barely starting to get into it after 400 reps on the highest resistance when all this started happening. This thing is going back to amazon.
4,Good Exercise Option,"I really like this rower, it was very simple to assemble, and provides a good workout for your back and shoulders. Also surprisingly your biceps arm muscles get pumped pretty fast. My only complaint is sometimes after 10 to 12 minutes of steady rowing the seat rollers seem to skip, or roll roughly, not a big deal but it sort of makes you think maybe something is not tight and could possibly be breaking. Other than that I love the rower, especially the price."
2,Missing/Broken Pieces in Shipment,"Quality control is apparently a problem with this product. The meter post is defective (the extension wire that connects to the meter is missing), the two screws used for attaching the meter to the meter post are missing and one screw for attaching the rear seat stopper to the center beam is missing. Stamina's Customer Service is supposed to ship replacements in 7-10 days. Assuming the correct parts arrive, we will try again to assemble the rower."
2,not for men,"this machine is not built to withstand daily usage at high resistance. I went through two machines in a matter of months and they both broke at the base of the arm. Unless you use a very low setting don't get this model. I upgraded to the Stamina double piston model (I believe its the 1205 or 1207, going by memory here) and it's much more rugged and comfortable too, and the price was only $20 more than this model.But one things for sure, I will always buy from Amazon. I was able to get a full credit for the 1050 because it didn't last more than a couple of months. They sent me a shipping label and all i had to do was box it and find a Brown truck."
1,Worst rowing machine I've ever rowed on.,"This items does not show speed or distance. All I have to say if you are a rower don't buy this machine, you will be very disappointed."
1,this is REALLY bad,very poor it doesn't do anything it says and a bad machine.. I will NOT recommend anyone to buy this and i feel this items needs to be discontinued and to start with it came with missing tools
1,Assembly instructions,"I just received the product. Wouldn't you know that the instrutions aren't clear and since this is a Saturday-they aren't working. Outside of the main parts, nothing else seems to be in place, though the instructions say they could be ""gathered"". What does THAT mean? I sure would appreciate it if someone, somewhere could let me know how to properly put this monster together. LOLMargie[..]"
1,pissed,i ordered it and it came with missing screws and also the black plastic on the frame was cracked and in two pieces. they paid for return and had the item shipped again no problem with that but the replacement shipment was also damaged cracked in the same spot and i don't even know if i can return it now cause i was away for two week and just found out it was cracked. now i am upset and annoyed what the fkeudc
2,Rower's Fine But Amazon Screwed Up w/No Directions,"The rower looks fine, for what I paid, but I got pretty sick for a long time (I have a chronic breathing disorder) and didn't open the box til more than a month after shipment.Surprise!!!! No directions, no photo, nothing. I'm very displeased with Amazon. It's the last time I'll order a large item like this; it's an excellent lesson in ""Whoa, you need to be careful with online orders!"" I'll figure it out because it's not rocket science, but I expected better from Amazon.com."
1,Poor design and not a real work out capability,"The foot rest on this machine were poorly designed, my feet kept sliping out;the handle also poorly designed, they kept bumping into each other;the level are truly just for young children, does not give a real work out capability. Sorry, but it's true.Last but not least, I had to pay over $60.00 for shipping here and back for the return !!"
4,Rowing Machine.,"I have had this machine for approximately 6 months, but I haven't used it regularly. My inability to use the footrest has made me more or less unwilling to put much time into the machine. I wear a women's size 6 shoe and my feet constantly fall out of the straps. My husband has no problems using the footrest, but he also wears a men's size 14 shoe. I will probably [attempt] to make some sort of alternative strap for the machine, but I probably wont be using the machine as often as I would like. I gave it four stars because my husband enjoys using it and the problem I have with it is probably something that only bothers people with smaller feet."
3,Beginners Rower with questionable durability,"Overall, I am happy with the stamina rower. I am a beginner and I like the design and was happy with the price. The frame and handles are solid metal but my gripe lies in the foot rest where they cheaped out and used thin plastic. One of the foot rests broke on my third use :("
1,Broken pieces after heavy use:,"Great product for the amount of money.After 18,937 reps, the right oar snapped off. (these parts are steel, so I welded it back on.)After 21,099 later the left oar snapped off. (I will be welding this one back on tonight.)I don't think I can complain really... for $90, I have used the hell out of this thing."
2,Poor Customer Service,The product was shipped damaged. It had a broken foot pedal. I emailed customer service and they said they would send a replacement. After approximately three weeks I have not received the replacement part. I sent an another email asking about the part and they have not replied.
1,Just don't do it.,"This machine is terrible. Your feet don't stay in the straps (I'm almost 5'9"" and have size 9 feet, so it isn't an issue of my height or shoe size) and the movement feels awkward. Forget about rowing quickly, the seat won't slide smoothly unless you're going slow. I can say that it was easy to assemble, but that's about the only positive. Five stars for Amazon for taking this thing back as a return, and paying for the return shipping. I'll spend some more money and buy a used Concept2 on Craigslist."
3,"Very good workout, b","Very good workout, but it can not work longer than 30min on highest resistance comming to no resistance at all."
2,Sramina Body Trac Glider,The sliding seat was made very cheaply as after only 3 days itstopped sliding back & forth. Amazon refunded my money quickly.The rowing part seemed to work well. I would not reccomend this product.
1,Not able to use it - poor design/construction.,"I bought this rower in November 2007 and did not use it since then due to the poor design/construction of the foot straps, which do not hold the feet securely. It has been sitting in a closet, taking up space..."
2,not well constructed,"I took a chance with this budget priced machine, hoping to get several months of use. At under $150, you don't expect much these days. Unfortunately this was true; I got a couple weeks of (noisy) workouts before the left oar broke at the weld joint. I also had to make a modification to shorten the travel of the seat as it glides backward; it's definitely not designed for shorter people. The squeaking noise makes for an annoying workout -- so avoid late night routines. Lastly, if you do purchase this unit, keep the carton handy in case you need to return the machine as I had to duct tape about 3 boxes together when I sent it back to Amazon."
4,Good Surprises and Bad,"Having read all the reviews before purchasing I was a little nervous. I have to say I am seriously impressed with how sturdy the rowing machine is built. And while I scoffed at people saying that it was put together (I consider myself a master assembler), I too had difficulties. Mostly because the instructions are verbose in all the wrongs ways. Instead of just labeling things ""Part A"" it has a ridiculously long name that causes more confusion than clarity. But really, you only assemble something once so who really cares.It provides a great upper body workout, that's for sure. But, one of the reasons I bought this was because its touts a full body workout. Here it falls short. Sure, my legs are pushing off for the ""drive"" portion of the row, but with no resistance at this step its just window dressing. Its great for what it does, but I'm going to have to buy another piece of equipment for the lower body."
2,Not reliable,"I used this machine for a few months and I followed all the instructions. I even checked out some videos on youtube on the best way to use a rowing machine like this. The machine quickly began to degrade. There were areas of wear and rubbing all over the long bar, as well as metal shavings in the grooved area where the seat slides. I tried cleaning it and spraying it down with WD40, but that just dripped out and I had to clean my carpet. I'm under the recommended weight limit, so I don't think that it should have broken down that quickly.It was a nice workout before it started to break down though."
2,meh,Generally underwhelmed with the product.Pros:1.Very inexpensive: Got it on sale for $106 during xmas.2.Assembly was easy though the instructions are not thorough.3. Compact - folds up easily to sit in the closet.Cons:1.Workout isn't challenging at all even at the highest setting (12). I run occasionally (max 15miles/week) & do yoga once or twice a week & wanted a solid cross training @home so went for this. HR didnt go up much even after 30 mins2.If this was meant as a non-impact workout for seniors I could see them benefiting a bit but i'm sure there are other more interesting & engaging options with better workouts. (treadmill/bench w/weights)Anyone under 50 looking for something serious would be better off staying away from this.
1,not very happy,"had a little assembly which I thought would be no big deal, but parts did not line up correctly to assemble. very upset."
5,Love this rowing machine!,"We love this rowing machine! The range of motion for the arms is so much better then the usual static back/forth motion, and although we've had a little issue with keeping our feet in the straps (as others complain) we changed to using our Vibram 5-fingers and/or flexible water shoes that have a rubbery grip, plus making a little change to our method of pull/push (lean and tension changes), and we have very little problem with foot slippage. The statistics monitor is very useful and easy to use - a great feature for this very affordable machine. We did have two seat rollers deteriorate - we were working the equipment pretty hard - but the company replaced no only two, but four rollers within a week. It was relatively easy to assemble. It is relatevely light weight for moving and storage (although we have not yet stored it). A great piece of equipment, especialy for the price."
2,NOT GOOD FOR SHORT PEOPLE!!!,Although I think this would be a great workout machine for someone 5'10 or taller it did not work out for me I am 5'4 and could not reach the peddles which made it absolutely useless for me :( If you are short this is not a good bike for you because you will have to put your feet on the ground in order to exercise.
1,Do not buy!!!!!!!!!!,Simply put I could not keep my feet in the holds and within 15 minutes of use the wheel bearings in the seat were shot i spent more time putting it together then it lasted. Do not buy.
4,Rowing,"The rower is a good buy for the price.It does what the ad says it will do. The only problem is my shoes slip out of the pedals. Overall is a very a good machine. I really get a good workout on arms, stomach, legs and buttocks. I recommend this machine to women looking for a low impact workout to tone and shape. I don't know how the rower would hold up for a really heavy person."
4,Glider,"The rower was easy to put together, good quality for the price, I am a man who is 6'4 240lbs and it was a good fit."
5,ALMOST as good as my old Pienert 26' Rowing Shell,"Very reasonably priced, I took advantage of the free shipping and Amazon had it here in 2 days. The assembly was painless, great instructions, very little to assemble and even had tools included, 15 minutes after UPS dropped it off I was ""rowing.""It is VERY quiet, you can watch a movie or listen to your iPod while exercising and not disturb anyone.THE ONLY BAD POINT I will gripe about is that the ""out-riggers"" (metal pipe that extends the ""oar locks"" or in this case the hinge point) need to be twice as wide, they are about 16"" and need to be about 35"". I may ""hack"" this ""mod"" myself because after having a real rowing shell this - though WAY BETTER than any other erg I have used - really isn't as comfortable as my old boat.Bottom line: If you want a great low impact work out for very little money I would highly reccomend this machine!"
3,1050c rower,Nice machine for the money. Foot pedal design needs work.Would have been really nice to have received the product manual in the box instead of having to download it. Also the product was delivered damaged. The small wire that tracks the time and number of rows was severed.
2,Stamina Body Glider,"Stamina Body Trac Glider 1050 Rowing MachineI really like what the machine offers, but the parts are cheap especially the pedals and the seat squeaks to high heaven.I know in the near future, I will have to upgrade. So, if you are a beginner like me this product is okay, but if you are an experienced rower then you need to step it up and spend a little more for a better machine."
4,Works for me,"I read the reviews before purchasing and can now see why some people complain about the instructions. The parts list taks a bit of time to sort out since parts are listed seperately even when some things are partially assembled (like the seat). At first it looked like there were missing bolts - they were just already holding things together. The parts list could be friendlier, particularly with bolt sizes, but I still managed full assembly in about 30 minutes.I selected this rower because it was promoted as very quiet. While it won't bother the neighbors (apartment), the shocks squeak. Quieter would be better but you can still watch TV without adjusting the volume. The shocks are pretty tight so if you are out of shape, it will take a few days/weeks to build up enough strength for a full cardio workout.Overall, it was a good choice."
3,Good machine,The Stamina Body Trac Glider 1050 Rowing Machine seems to be a good buy for the price. Doesn't take up much room. There are two look outs. The first being that the seat is unpadded and hard. My wife puts an old piece of foam on it and is happy. The other is the foot straps. They don't hold her feet very well with or without shoes. This can be an issue since you need your feet to be secured to pull you back to the front of the machine. She has solved this problem by putting her feet under the foot pads and hooking her toes under them to pull her back to position. Since she discovered this technique she says it is a non-issue. We have had this for about a month and already she has used it more than any other piece of equipment she has tried in the past.
5,Rowing Machine,"I wanted an inexpensive rowing machine that would hold up well, be easy to store and be used three times a week. This is a great product just for that, and at $120 it is hard to beat the price. The seat is a little hard but a small pillow helps. It was easy to assemble and functions well. I like the timer as I usually use it for 30-45 minutes while watching the news on TV. It is quiet enough for that. It is also light weight and easy to move around. I weigh about 200 pounds and fits my body well. Good product. Some other reviewers have indicated oil leaking from the cylinder. I have not experienced that as yet, but having owned another more expensive rowing machine, it is a fairly common trait. I use a thin rubber mat under the machine to protect the carpet."
4,Good machine for home,Well built. Easy to assemble. I really get a nice at home workout with this machine. (You have to wear good sturdy shoes or sneakers and strap your feet in well in order to get a good workout)
4,Useful machine,"This item does seem to provide a good workout. We have found that folding it up to store is a bit of a nuisance, so it's currently taking up more space than I would like."
3,Only one problem,"I like this machine; it gives you different levels of resistance, unlike other rowing machines that don't. I bought it so I could lose weight and regain much of my lost aerobic capacity, but there's only one problem with it: the foot-rest pieces are too close to each other, so, my big belly gets crunched and squeezed in the middle when I move forward, keeping me from sliding all the way in for the electronic counter to recognize a repetition or keep the clock going. I can still exercise, but this flaw makes it uncomfortable. I guess that once my big belly trims down, I'll feel a lot more comfortable in the machine."
3,Stamina Body Trac,"Did not receive any instructions with this equipment. How to put it together, tension or how to use it."
