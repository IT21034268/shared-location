5,Fringe is superb tv,"This is a wonderful, mesmerizing story with great characters and beautiful picture and sound on my Kindle fire 7"" hd.I""m into the 2nd season and each episode is amazing. Anna Torv is a really fine and beautiful actress. All the characters are entertaining and delightful.I'll be looking at all the ""seasons"" of Fringe!!!"
4,I was an X Filer. Season 1,"Fringe really picks a lot from the X Files which if you liked, you'll like this as well. It's remarkably similar and that's a good thing."
3,Fringe from Amazon,Good enough. It's not the most believable story line and over-acting is distracting. We haven't made it through the first season. Hope it gets better.
5,Great Sci-fi series,I can't believe all these years I missed this series. One of the best series ever to be on TV. But at least I have gotten to watch it on my Kindle Fire. I highly reccomend watching it and definitley start from the very first episode or you will a lot.
5,Best show on TV!,The show is likely to be the most under appreciated shows ever. It's sad because it's one of my all time favorite.The acting is superb. The production value is phenomenal. And the story lines are amazing.
4,"Good, but I expected a few extra features...","Everything was great, I love this show and I didn't have the blu ray collection so I decided to buy it once and for all. When I received this one (first season) I was really excited about it, but I expected a little more about the features regarding the subtitles, because I'm more comfortable with the spanish subs (which is my mother language), I know that it was my fault 'cause I didn't see the product details, but I must say that there was no other offer with this characteristics, I mean there is no blu ray of Fringe first season with spanish subtitles. Anyway I'm almost the happiest girl with my collection. I just need the fourth season and we are complete!!"
4,Very intriguing,The show is very entertaining and intriguing. I find myself watching at least 2-3 episodes in a row and even starting to rewatch some with my children.
4,Good start,"As with any series, it takes a while for the characters to gel. This one is off to a good beginning. A little sloppy in the first few episodes as it is a bit unclear which direction the show is going, if any."
4,a little out there but very engaging,"I definitely enjoyed this show. It was very engaging but a little over the top and outlandish. A little predictable and cheesy at point, but enjoyable and entertaining."
4,Fans of the X-Files should check it out.,"Although the premise is a bit hard to believe, the show is a great sci-fi procedural in the style of the X-Files. I started watching because the show has finished and friends tell me that the conclusion of the series is satisfying."
5,Good show!,Love all the twists and unique plots. Getting it with Amazon Prime makes it even better since it's so cheap.
5,Season 1 sets the stage for an incredible 5 season run,"The story lines and the character development for the first season are well thought out and approached from a ""procedural"" or episodic type of sic-fi drama. In the second season the show delivers on the mythology that accumulates throughout the first season in a more concrete and linear fashion. Season One contains lots of clues thrown in but not in order of importance or in any clear sequence which is the key to not feeling like you are being spoon-fed some conspiracy theory that is oversimplified just to make this a mainstream show like CSI or NCIS or UPS911.The time you invest in this show pays off throughout the series but don't expect to figure it all out by the 4th episode. Who would want to anyway? Ana Torv and Joshua Jackson lead an amazing cast so don't be surprised when you find yourself watching 6 episodes back to back without noticing it's 3am already."
5,Great Series,"I have to agree with some of the other reviews that state that this series builds up from season 1 into a much better series. If you get dismayed with the first few episodes please stick with it for a few more. By Season 2 Fringe has become a truly great series. The cast has melded together and found their niche. Oddly enough my favorite characters aren't always the leads. For instance; The lovely Astrid (assistant to Walter) is featured much more prominet in Season 2 and I'm finding her to be quite an engaging character. It seems the public and writers agree with that assessment too, as she is featured more and more. So, if you are looking for an exciting series and love your Sci-fi stuff I highly recommend Fringe. Just remember it does start off kinda slow...but by mid season 1 and into season 2 it's become one of my favorite Sci-fi shows."
4,One of the great TV show,"I love Fringe, from writing to story to acting. The reason I only gave four stars was because of the subtitles of the DVD in Chinese. I don't know whom they hired, but the Chinese translation is not good. It is not horrible, but it definately does not grasp the essence of the lines in many scenes. It's a disgrace to my favorite show. I don't know if the executive producers or any crew members of the show will ever read these reviews, but if they do, I hope they'll hire someone else to do the Chinese translation for the third reason DVD."
5,one of a kind,"this is by far the best si-fi show ever, it has a great storie line,and adventure, with the perfect actor to play walter. i plan to own every season"
3,It's OK,"It's OK, kinda like X-files. It's funny how every weird thing is related to prior experiments 17 years ago to the same scientist. And no further research is ongoing? No other scientists are working for the government any more? And how many times can they reanimate 1 guy?"
4,Top 10 Pilot you will ever see. Catch JJ Abrams on his rise.,"Never watched this when it was active. Like Abrams other cult classic, Lost, this pushes the envelope for the thinking man's TV drama. Unlike Lost, it doesn't jump the shark ever third episode.We've witnessed a golden age of television in the Aughts, where TV writing was superior to the Theatrical releases. Fringe is one of the reasons why."
2,Watch X Files,I made it through 14 episodes and stopped. Not worth the investment. Watch the X Files and avoid this JJ Abrams swill
4,strange fun,"This takes strange science to extremes. Some.of the episodes are too much for me, but my husband likes all of them. I hope I don't dream about the show because it would be a nightmare for sure."
2,The one that got away,I downloaded this because I had a brain fart and I deleted this show. Now I find out that I cannot save this from my Tivo to my PC because it is copyrighted. From now on if I miss an episode I will just watch it on [...]. If I cannot keep it on my PC why spend any money on it.
2,fantastic for average intelligence viewers. insulting for the rest of us.,"seriously? they throw in enough 5-dollar-word jargon to make us think this show is done with intelligence, but its just another unbelievable characters, unrealistic scenarios, and a poor attempt to mix X-files and abrams-esque slow-bake thriller-ism. had to stop this one half way through the first show. boo!"
2,A little silly,"The style simarities with ""Lost"" are very strong. Picture that with only 3 main characters and the Sci-Fi aspect cranked way up. Being this is the first season I hope it gets better."
2,For girls only,"The main character is an idiot, if you're a guy spare yourself. They tried to rip off the x-files but did an awful job."
2,Slow and Lack of Content,"Spoiler Alert!I watched Fringe every week and bought the DVD set.Fringe is just not that good. It is slow. Something happens, let's go see what is going on. Every episodes are similar. After the first season, I lost interest. The characters don't have any emotion. The show lacks content. The show has very little philosophical or psychological value. It doesn't make you think or connect. This is definitely not X Files or Star Trek.*Spoiler*I like the idea that we are having a war between our parallel universe. I also like the idea that ET is watching. But again, after the first season, I just don't care anymore. It maybe nice if they give ET a bigger role to understand what make us human even in a parallel universe. But that will make Fringe another X Files and Star Trek show.two stars from me."
1,just horrible,"Might have been an entertaining show if the acting was not so incredibly unbearable. Just awful. If I could have left less than one star, I would have...."
1,"Love this show, but","The description really ruins this season finale. I wasn't surprised at all, and that's disappointing! I wish someone would remove the part that tells who William Bell is.I realize 1 star is harsh, but I would definitely give it 5 stars if the description hadn't ruined it. The part where Bell steps out of the shadows is very dramatic but would have been 100% better if it had been a surprise. The overall story is good."
5,FRINGE Benefits!,"In its inaugural season, the FOX offering of the Sci-Fi/Mystery saga FRINGE did not disappoint. While entering a market that has been dominated by such fan-friendly juggernauts as X-Files, LOST, and to an extent Unsolved Mysteries, the show delivered a knockout. A captivating cast, compelling story lines, and enough well produced special effects to keep it current, FRINGE first season set the stage for what could be a long run indeed. The DVD offers insightful, light-hearted, and relevent featurettes as part of its Extras along with stunning extra footage. Get in on this show asap, you won't regret it."
5,Good!,My mom loved the series and I've begun watching it too! The cover for the DVD set is very cool to look at. I'm very happy with this purchase.
5,fring the first season,"I love it. Wish there were more shows like this on tv. Great stories, great writting, and fabulous characters. It always leaves me wanting more."
5,Cannot express how happy I am to have found this show.,"It is simply a thrill to watch I appreciate all the scientific concepts that are applied to this show, thank you JJ ABRAMS!"
5,A great show,I love the series. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and keeps you wanting to see more.
5,Fantastic show,"One of the best new series on TV, smart, well written, well acted, and above all, intriguing."
5,Like the Wierd Stuff...,"...then this is for you. Several years ago I caught a few episodes of Fringe and loved it. However, have never been able to connect with it, since I work nights. Netflix does not have this in their down-stream availability. So I was very excited when I saw it offered via Amazon Prime...Yeah!!! Quality on my Kindle Fire HD has been Excellent!"
4,Sci fi suspense,The season starts off slow but picks up significantly mid season and the cliffhanger ending is pretty awesome. Parallel dimensions can be ridiculous if not done right. Fringe excels at making pseudoscience and theoretical physics credible despite some of the far out unproven and seemingly impossible theories it depicts. Good solid sci fi.
5,Love it,It's like a modern x files. Love the twists in the subplot. I'm hooked. I can't believe I'd never seen this show before
5,"A great deal for $10 bucks, includes two of Hughes films!!","This documentary on Howard Hughes was informative, albeit seemingly done on a lower budget: it was great to delve a little deeper into the history of Hughes and his life, as well as see two of his films! As a two-sided disc with extras, it's a great deal for ten bucks! If you'd like to find out a bit more about Howard Hughes (from watching ""The Aviator"" in theatres), this is a great place to start..."
5,Great Documentary...Plus Movies!,"I think the documentary is very informative and is a great compliment to ""The Aviator"", if you want to learn more about Mr. Hughes after seeing the movie. What is also great is that there are two full-length films on the flip side: The Outlaw and The Sins Of Harold Diddleback(Mad Wednesday), plus tons of bonus features as well. I believe this to be the best Hughes documentary on the market...and for the price and bonus features, you can't go wrong!"
1,"Howard Huges - His Life, Loves and Films",No closed captioned for that particular movie. very very disappointed!!!!!!!
5,"For Progressive Republicans ""Back to Basics"" is Essential","This history brief is one excellent book. It is rich in facts. It is strong in party identification. And I have never had such a healthy respect for Reconstruction. This book offers Republicans an armour of facts about their party, and an arsenal of truth vs the Democrat party. Additionally, I have never had such a sense of pride and confirmation that I chose the Republican Party long ago. So good is this work it is imperative I send copies to friends and relatives."
5,Canon Safe Interior Power Box options,I purchased this @ Lowes and used it for the Powerbox inside of the Canon Safe. I wanted to mount some sort of lighting and found that rope lighting was just the ticket. This switch was the perfect answer to be able to light the interior of the safe WHEN NEEDED. The plug in unit is the perfect size for the bottom outlet for lighting and leave me with another for the dehumidifier rod. 5 stars for the price and what it's designed for.
1,Worked for a month,I bought this switch and it worked perfect for about a month. After that it went dead. Check and replaced the battery and still nothing. Would not recommend.
3,"Great! When it works, that is...","Like others who have reviewed this item, my switch is in a relatively small room (10X10) and has a nearly-clear path from remote to plug unit. Yet... it works only 1/3 of the time. I replaced the battery last week and noticed an improvement for the first evening. After that, I'm back to pressing the toggle button many times in an effort to turn the lights on or off. I'd be happy to pay for for better quality but I'm concerned that they're all basically the same."
3,Doesn't work 100% of time,"I have this set up as the switch on the wall when you first walk into my 12'x13' bedroom and on the other side of the room is the lamp. This switch litterly only works about 10% of the time if I'm lucky. I dont know if it needs to be right next to the switch or what, but it doesnt have good range at all. The idea is good, but unless you want to keep clicking the on/off switch several times just to hope it finally turns the light on, I'd look for another one. The only reason I didnt rate it a 2 star is because if your patient enough to keep clicking the switch to turn the light on, its beats re-wiring your house for an extra switch."
1,Worked Once...,"You get what you pay for in life, and this product was a good example of that. I opened it up, got it all set up, pushed the button, and just like magic my lights turned on. Quite satisfied with my purchase, I pushed the button again... nothing. Lights stayed on. The product never worked again. I tried everything I could think of - I moved the switch around, I wiggled the batteries. Dead."
4,Works as advertised,"I bought two of these (on separate frequencies) and both work flawlessly. The switch looks a little odd, but probably as good as it can given the form factor.Signal strength is quite good -- a brick wall and a washing machine are in between one of the plugs and its switch.As noted by other reviewers, there are no separate ""on"" or ""off"" directions. Pushing the switch on either side simply toggles the power."
5,Makes for a nice installation,"I used this for an under cabinet led lighting solution. In the past, I either had to mount an electrical box and cover plate under the cabinet, which stood out and looked sloppy or had a wire dangling down to plug into a socket.This allowed me to hide all the wiring for the under cabinet wiring in the stove vent area and mount the switch next to the other switches for the kitchen. No wires or electrical junction boxes show and the installation looks very professional."
5,Great Help for understanding Bergman,"I took an Ingmar Bergman class, and I therefore had to watch a lot of Bergman films as well as analyze and write about them. Many of Bergman films as many know are sometimes very hard to understand. However this book cleared up so many things for me in the films. The fact the book is mostly Bergman commenting on his own films is great, so you don't have someone else trying to interpret someone else's mind. I you need or want to better understand and enjoy Bergman's works, get this book!!"
2,Texas Real Estate Sales Exam 2nd Edition,This book did not cover much of what I expected. It covers subjects on fitness and well-being. These subjects should not be part of an exam practice book. I went to the public libary and found much better practice workbooks written by Charles J. Jacobus. Not too pleased with my purchase.
4,Blocks out most sounds,"I got this September because I had just moved into my dorm and suite mates, fridge and ac were really loud and annoying. (paper thin walls) I've gotten more used to such sounds but these ear plugs block out most sounds such as keyboard / mouse clicking and fridge humming. You can still hear people talking if you occasionally, ac blowing and constant white noise similar to a sea shell because of the way it fits in the ear. I also got used to the white noise but still these are pretty good."
1,I recommend the seller but not the product.,"I would recommend this seller because the item was sent and arrived faster than estimated. I bought this product for someone else's usage and though they didn't find the product to be useful, in that it did not appropriately plug the ears to cut off sound, it was safety packaged. It had not been tampered with. As such, it's uselessness was not any fault of the seller. I recommend the seller, but not the product."
1,Does not work very well.,"I followed the dierections and shoved them in my ears. Nothing really happened. I can block sound better by plugging my ears with my fingers. Maybe this helps block the noise of jet engines or something very loud, but that doesnt really make sense to me. Kinda a waste of money."
3,"Not ""ultimate,"" but not bad","I have very small ears, and while these earplugs are slightly softer than the others I've tried, they still ended up making my ears feel sore after a short period of time. On the bright side, they blocked out most noise and didn't fall out while I slept. I was able to faintly hear people talking loudly down the hall, but it didn't bother me too much."
5,Great,"Unpretentious, yet magically beautiful.A young girl's diary of three years of her life in the end of the XIX century in a small diamond-extracting town in Brazil.Not meant for publication, the author gathered her writings to organize a booklet for her grand-daughters. When she was convinced to publish it, she could never dream it would turn out to be translated into many other languages.A must for literature lovers."
5,A Wonderful and Insightful Documentary,"I thought ""The Horses Of Gettysburg"" was a Wonderful and Insightful Documentary about the care, training, and use of Horses and Mules at Gettysburg and during the Civil War. Most people are aware of the loss of animals during the war, but not the figures of actual animals used, wounded, and killed during the battles. This is a great addition to any Civil War film collection and I recommend it highly."
2,A Little Too Boring For Me,"I thought this would be a really interesting film but it was a bit boring. We never made it through to the end, I had to turn it off."
2,The Two Doctors,"I did not like this story. I found the flesh-eating characters unsavory to say the least and to have a Time Lord, even temporarily to become one even more so. I also feel that the cinematography is not good. There are scenes in this serial which best be shorter. I liked to see Patrick Troughton again of course, again with Frazer Hines."
2,For die hard fans only!,This video is for die hard fans of the second and the sixth doctors! It far too long and there's a lot the story does not explain! Watch this video if want to have every episodes on video! Rent this video first before you buy it if you can!
1,Painfull,"I never liked Colin Baker, but this is beyond bad...it's painfull to watch. It's sad knowing that this piece of garbage was Patrick Troughton's last apperience. The story make no sense and Peri is oh so very very very anoying. From seeing this piece of trash, I know that the Colin Baker years really were the worst. AVOID!!"
5,This is the cutest doll I have ever seen!,I have never seen such a cute doll. I am a kid and if you ask me dolls are educational because they teach you responsibility. This doll would be durable except the wings of the butterfly may be a little fragile. But if you ask me this doll is an ideal Christmas or Hannukah present for any girl 14 years or younger. This doll is on the top of my Christmas list.
2,Somewhat dated and grandiose,"This is an extraordinary piece. It deserves a setting where the music can come through. I found myself distracted by the strong vibrato (I could almost see the epiglottises flapping with the vibration), not to mention a rolled r, a bland flute solo, an almost bleating oboe...I could go on, but why, when I am simply not in agreement with what anyone else has said. <sigh>But I'm only on my second hearing...perhaps it will improve with time. :-0"
1,Discontinued,"This was not the item I ordered.I was told by Amazon the supplier no longer offers item. I used it,did not perform as I thought it would."
4,Opinion of meditation teacher...,"You can listen to samples above and there is also a discription of the music as having human voices, synthesized ethereal sounds, etc. What you can't get is an overall sense of the effect through headphones over time.In addition to teaching meditation and using biofeedback for educational purposes including in public lectures, I have a graduate education in integral psychology. My experience using this CD is positive and I find it a helpful accompaniment to meditation.Theoretically, I know that entrainment technology can work. However, I haven't done any personal or wider tests with this CD. I do know it is very relaxing to listen to as are other CDs in this series. My very favorite by this particular person isOm - The Reverberation Of Source."
5,Joe Bataan,"Joe Bataan is and was a gifted, remarkable and unique artist. He is technically in a class by himself."
4,"Nothing fancy, but gets the job done very well","It is just what it looks like, a shaped piece of wood, but it does a great job in rolling out pie crusts, pastries, etc. Not sure why Amazon decided to send it in a HUGE box, though. Regardless, a very handy rolling pin, only caveat is that, unlike stone pins, it doesn't weigh very much, so, depending on the application, you may have to apply some force of your own (not a big deal, just different if you're used to a heavier pin)."
5,"A truly amazing ""rolling""","Have used this rolling pin for cut-out cookies, pie crusts, etc. It is very easy to use because it does not have any handles that ""turn"" when you're rolling out your dough. The length is perfect and it seems you don't have to use as much pressure on your dough to get it just right."
3,This is great for chapatis since it is Indian in design,This design is used mainly in Indian cookery to roll chapatis. Any Indian grocery store will carry the same type at a fraction of a price and works just as well.
2,A little short for the job,It is a little small to work any dough of consequence. It works well if you are working with a very small dough. This might be a pin to have if you are developing quiver of rolling pins. I bought the OXO rolling pin with the handles. I like that much better
3,Not what I expected,"Doesn't work as I had hoped, but I think someone needs to show me. I'm used to a larger, more substantial product and haven't developed the technique, so it sits in the cupboard. The wood and quality seems to be high, so if this is the right style for you, I'm sure you'll be happy with it."
1,Would be nice if I could get it!!,Twice I've tried to order this pin and twice it was never delivered. Seems that whoever is shipping it from Irving Texas never delivers it to DHL to actually ship. Finally got a refund but I wanted the rolling pin. Oh well guess I'll have to find a local source for it.
5,Not just for pie crust!,"The other reviewers are quite right that this pin will get your pie dough smooth and round without all the fuss you are accustomed to. However, you will truly feel tears of joy and gratitude welling up in your eye sockets the first time you roll out a batch of tortilla dough with this handsome little devil. Hallelujah!!! Nothing is more embarrassing than presenting your guests with unshapely flatbreads (burnt because you toiled so long on each that the previous one was neglected on the griddle). This beauty gets it done with speed, dignity, and a touch of sass."
4,"Great tool, you can't go wrong","My old rolling pins were clunky and old and not used very much. Purchased this one based on others positive reviews and they were correct. Quality product, cleans and stores easily and does what it supposed to do."
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"The rolling pin we received was not a Vic Firth. Instead Red Arrow sent us a cheap Winco knockoff. You will see them advertised elsewhere on Amazon for less than half the price of the Vic Firth. Funny thing, though. There was no note of apology from Red Arrow or explanation or offer to refund us the difference in price. Hmmm.... A little suspicious?? After we received it we dug through the Amazon reviews and discovered this was not a one-time fluke. There are numerous reviews from people who received the same cheap knock off. After talking with Amazon, they gave me the phone number to contact the company to try to get the order straight. The number simply went to a voice mail saying, ""The person at this extension is not available."" Nothing saying what company, dept or person I had called. Called Amazon back and they are doing a full return for me. At least Amazon is dependable if some of their vendors are not."
5,Perfect,"For those who use the old fashioned rolling pins, try a french rolling pin! You have better control and can shape your dough much easier."
2,"Nice, but","I bought this for use in my home where a lot of baking is done. While it is nicely made, it is much narrower than others I've looked at, and lighter in weight. It is probably best for a small woman's hand, and not where a man will be using it. I was diappointed, ended up giving it away, and buying a different one."
5,not a drumstick for sure,"freaks me out a little that Vic Firth makes drumsticks and rolling pins. Bakers swear by it and, so do I!"
4,Works very well,"It's the perfect size, light weight, not too big around so it rolls out very well. I just used it to make homemade pasta and it was an excellent tool. Pie crust will work equally well. This is the only kind of roller to use, all others are inferior. I've been baking and using roller pins for 30 years."
4,Best rolling pin for precise dough shapes,"This is a great rolling pin - a great size, high quality wood, very well made. It's very easy to clean when comparing to rolling pins with handles.It's a little difficult when dealing with doughs that are very dense, but when it comes to making a perfect circle for pies, this rolling pin can't be beat!"
1,everything is crooked now,"Bottom line: When the built-in level is level, the laser line is not. Makes a great paperweight."
2,Doesn't stick to tub & tickles instead of cleans,"This item would stick to the bottom of my tub quite nicely... until I turned the water on. As soon as the suction gets wet, it slips and slides all over. I had to hold it with one foot while ""scrubbing"" the other foot. It's too soft and rubbery - it felt more like a tickling attack than a scrub. I wouldn't recommend this product."
2,waste of time,I bought this hoping it contained some new original hard rock music. Boy was I disappointed. Save your money for the new Metallica CD. These guys are even trying to look like Metallica. This CD is OK at best.
3,Kicks!,"Finally a heavy band with a singer that can sing and guitarists that can play! Intelligent songwriting, great licks. A real pleasure to hear agressive music with a sense of melody. The production could have been a lot better, but this CD still blows away every demo in my milk crate...Obsidian's Fred (who ever he is) is staying near my CD player! I'll be keeping my eyes and ears out for these guys!"
5,A Great Import,"I got into Jimmy Barnes music after hearing his collaboration with INXS onThe Lost Boys Original Motion Picture Soundtrackand had to hear more of his music.I found this cassette at a bargain store in 1991 and fell in love with the songs ""No Second Prize"", ""Promise Me You'll Call"", ""American Heartbeat"" and ""Without Your Love"".My first Amazon purchase in May of 1999 was the importedFor the Working Class Man, which I wrote a brief review for, because I was so happy to be reunited with these songs. I lost that CD during a move and was happy to see this one was available for a cheaper price and snatched it up.I've read reviews where people have called Jimmy a glorified Australian Bryan Adams clone but I don't see any semblance at all, Bryan's music totally being Rock tinged and Jimmy sporting more a Country twang.These songs are timeless and the overall album is great and should be given a listen."
2,Kripal Gathers Too Much From Too Little,"While I am a Ramakrishna admirer, I admit I was intrigued by the book at first. Expecting long-supressed secrets about RK, what I got was a very few obscure statements and stories turned into an elaborate Freudian analysis of Tantra. This, along with a meandering hypothesis about what was in RK's subconscious. It's just too shaky, and Kripal is too eager to sniff out a conspiracy. For example, in the book's second edition, Kripal admits that Ram Chandra Datta's book--which he claimed was supressed by the RK establishment--was, to his surprise, published by the Ramakrishna Mission the same summer as the first edition of ""Kali's Child""! In the end, Kripal does not convince, and RK remains a mystery."
1,A huge piece of junk,"One need not waste his time collecting junks. May read something useful...Should one dare to translate a foreign-language book when he can't speak/write/understand a paragraph without the help of a dictionary? It seems, that's not a problem for Mr. Kripal at all! Without knowing Bengali, the author tries to prepare his ""thesis"" with the help of several books written in Bengali. Outcome is: massive intentional and stupid mis-translations leading to a utterly crazy (NOT scholarly) hypothesis.My comment:If Mr. Kripal's translation from his references are correct, then the other frightening possibility is (I happened to carefully read those original Bengali books.):I must have absolutely forgotten my mother tongue (Bengali), which I hoped to use until I die!"
1,The most disgusting book,"I am a Bengali myself. I found that the author has intentionally used very obscure translations of the original Bengali words , and have used those to suit his perverse agenda to degrade one of the greatest spiritual genius of India."
1,Fantasy in the name of scholarship,The author fantasizes about an Indian saint with very poor understanding of Indian culture in particular the Bengali form of it. With some preconcieved biases the author makes every incident in ramakrishna's life is fit into those biased categories. A general indicator of what 'Indology' has descended to nowdays in western academia.
1,Scholarship or fraud?,"Just because Kali's Child won AAR award some people seem to believe it passed the test of academic vigor. This is akin to saying since Enron hired third party accountants their accounting books are not cooked. We now know better. Atleast Enron hired third party, no such pretense is made in case of Indology. Jeffrey Kripal's Knowledge of Bengali is suspect, so is his scholarship. He is yet to accept a debate in Bengali language in an open forum speaks reams about his proficiency.There has been a scholarly rebuttal to Kripal at http://www.infinityfoundation.com/mandala/s_rv/s_rv_tyaga_kali1_frameset.htm. However Kripal declined to include Tyagananda's rebuttal in newer versions of the book. All this says more about state of Indology studies & Kripal than the later has to say about Ramakrishna."
1,Scholarly work !! Dont kid me,To think that this book is a scholarly work is to belittleour intelligence. Sri ramakrishna told only 2 things in liferenounce sex and gold. A person of such great spiritual stature who inspires in ordinary people to lead a chaste and spiritual life cannot be tainted in such a grotesque manner. Is religionobtained by mere scholarship and erudition? It cannot even be realized by argument. Whose sanction did Mr kripal have when publishing this book. Religion is obtained by leading a pure and chaste life coupled with austere practises. Would Mr Kripal have left any of his wordly life pursuits while writing this book. Sri Ramakrishna was a spiritual giant and only giants can comprehend giants. Mr Kripal obviously is not a realized man. What then makes him an authority in publishing this book. Its a shame that an Indian has defaced our beloved Ramakrishna. Shame on you Mr Kripal.
1,What a waste!,"If you are not familiar with ""blind leading the blind"", this is it. If a person is wearing a yellow glass, everything he sees will have the yellow shadow. And this author seemed to have a deluded perception which resulted in this book!"
1,titilating but totally flawed scholarship,"The author presupposes first and then manufactures evidence.A classic example of the pursuit of the exotic under the guise of scholarship that has come to personify much of work in the West regarding Hinduism. However, it makes ""interesting"" reading for someone (like myself) who many many years ago spent 8 years as a student in Ramkrishna Mission educational institutions. This book is worthless to anyone seeking an introduction to Ramakrishna's life or his ideas."
1,Unconvincing,Kripal is unable to provide any convincing arguments for his thesis. The book can only be termed very poor scholarship. I'm surprised that Wendy Doniger supported this work; it has certainly hurt her reputation.
1,absolutely worthless,I sincerely wonder whether the author is Texan Christian who is out to prove that everything about Hinduism is bad. He neither has the background of the place and time of Ramakrishna Paramhansa neither he has any depth on wha he is talking about. I think he is disturbed individual tying to seek some quick recognition by creating controversy.
3,Halfway decent,"I am giving this 3 stars. The three are because (i) I enjoyed reading it (ii) the author has presented an interesting viewpoint with an attempt at backing up his conclusions with data and (iii) the debate about the book has been enjoyable to read. The missing stars are because the author's conclusions are flimsy and he goes overboard in concluding a lot from little data, and because the book is rambling and a bit contrived; he could say what he needed to in a few chapters, and the rest is filler."
1,Just a bad book,As someone said: love the cover and recycle the rest. It is such poor scholarship that give the academic book bad name.
1,Preconceived notions,"Take a person who knows what one wants to write, sets off to research on the subject, finds practically nothing to substantiate one's points of view on the subject and then goes on to twist existing stories to suit personal opinions and invent non-existing stories. And then the person goes on to write his/her piece of fiction, then one would come up with a Kali's Child. The reader is advised, from one who has known and read about Sri Ramakrishna for more than ten years now, that his book is loaded heavily with the author's incorrect presumptions and conclusions. If one wants to know truly about Sri Ramakrishna, read ""The Life of Ramakrishna"" by Romain Rolland, 1914 Literature Nobel prize winner."
1,Shoddy book,"Having examined the Bengali original, all I can say that the author does not really know the language and his translations, on which he bases his thesis, are just wrong. This issue has been discussed at length by S. Tyaganand. It is a book that should not have been published before reviewing it by Bengali scholars."
1,The author is either ignorant or insane,"I read this book and it is not worth the time that one spents on reading it.I Have read a few biographies of other Indian saints written by Western journalists , and writers which were more honest.This person Jeffrey Kirpal has no understanding of what is Dwaitha , adwaitha or Saktham or the Brahman.Dwaitham is a belief or practise where as Adwaitham is not a belief , rather it is a state of mind.one could very well assume that this author just wanted to denigrate Ramakrishna.If the world had accepted homosexuality as the most sacred thing , then this author would have written that Ramakrishna was a womaniser.this book has all the qualities to be banned"
1,A Projection of Author's Homophobia,"The book is based on non-existent quotes, mistranslations, deliberate distortions, cultural insensitivity. Here is an online review of the book http://www.infinityfoundation.com/ECITkalichildframeset.htm The author has confessed himself that he fled a Benedictine chapel after some fellow monks made sexual advances at him. The book is, therefore, a projection of the author's own homophobia. Jeffrey is a pretender. While he harps that he referred to the 'original' Bengali sources, the fact is that he cannot even read Bengali without the help of a English-Bengali dictionary. I am quite surprised so many worthies in South Asia studies spoke of this book in such glowing terms- apparently a manifestation of nepotism prevailing in the American Academy of Religion."
1,Piece of disgusting junk,"If this is considered scholarship, I would consider a caveman to be a more honest person intellectually than this author Jefferey Kripal. However much I tried, I could not find honesty or scholarship in this book. I saw only wanted and biased mis-interpretations of original Bengali texts by a person who is not well versed in Bengali and interpretations that defy logic or common sense.I would not recommend anyone to waste their time with this book even if they get paid for it. The disgusting feeling we are left with while reading is not worth it.I give it 1 star only because Amazon does not let me give it negative points."
1,A very poor and unscholarly treatment of the Great saint,"This book by Jeff Kripal smacks of ignorance. What can be the credibility of conclusions formed by a person who was in Bengal for eight months [the period during which he researched for his 'magnum opus'] and claims that all his conclusions are based upon the original bengali work without knowing a single word of bengali to begin with? Even at the end of those eight months, he could hardly speak Bengali. One can't understand how has the author arrived at these conclusions."
1,Aberration of a weak mind,"The author's mission is like that of a vulture who might soar high, yet vision is confined to dead carcass. He has attempted to study sun with the help of a candlelight"
3,"A Free Lunch, Maybe, But Not A Gourmet Meal","Though there are some truly choice tunes on this CD (like ""She's on Drugs,"" ""Bakersfield"" and ""Shirley Maclaine"")--which compiles some of the Butcher's late-80's and early-90's recordings for Creation Records--there are too many great tunes missing for this to be a recommended investment, even for the novice Jazz Butcher fan-to-be. Why a remix of ""President Chang,"" when they could have fit on a couple of other missing gems like ""Sweetwater"" or ""Susie?"" You're better off just picking up any of the individual albums represented here (particularly the altogether brilliantCult of the BasementandWaiting for the Love Bus) for a more complete picture of the mercurial Pat Fish. For fans of Robyn Hitchcock, The Velvet Underground and The Modern Lovers."
3,son loves this!,Got this for my 6 year old and he loves it but the helmet is tiny. He still manages to wear it and it's funny to see sitting on top of his head. The chest plate was a little big but this was overall a good gift.
1,"A bit disappointed, but cheap.","I bought this for my 4 year old son. The items are flimsy, and I know it's for pretend play and not serious costuming, but the chestpiece doesn't even stay on without being tied in the back with a piece of string. Even on the tightest settings, the straps really just aren't meant to sit on a child's frame. Without the breastplate, the set kinda became worthless bc my son wasn't interested in struggling to keep it on, or wearing it without all the pieces. The sword snapped at the hilt after a few weeks.I didn't pay that much for the set so I can't be too upset, but given the chance I would not choose to buy more sets from this manufacturer."
4,"Fun, But Flimsy","This knight set is very cute, but be warned, it is made quite cheaply and the plastic bends and warps easily. It's a little too big for my 3-year-old son, but he doesn't mind (and will easily be able to fit it when he's 6). He loves dressing up and playing with the sword! The chest in particular can be bent out of shape if stored even slightly compressed, so you may want to make sure you have a place to put it before you buy it."
4,gladiator set,This toy is fun and very inexpensive. My 2 year olds love it. However the breastplate cracked in the front within 2 weeks so the durability with toddlers is questionable. overall the toy is worth the money.
3,we love this set!,My three year old has really enjoyed his knight in shining armor set! He has a plastic tool belt that he uses to hold the scabbard and shield and he goes around the house swishing his sword! The only problem is that it is not very durable. Both the helmet and the shield have already (since Christmas) been taped to hold them together. We may be needing to order another set pretty soon.
5,They have them at the $1 store!,They have these exact pieces at the dollar store. The only thing different is the sword at the dollar store does not have a 'case' ? ... I can't think of the word... lol the thing in the picture that it shows the sword can be put in... anyways they are actually pretty durrable for the $1 store. The sword is probably the least durrable but it gets more fighting use then all of the other toys. My kids Love them. They also have them in different colors at the dollar store. :)
2,Blade froze up after 1-2 years of light use,"The blender worked fine for about a year or so, then the blade completely and solidly froze up. We used it about once a month."
1,"Perfect for a prop, thats about it.","This should be $30.00 at the most. The wood looks real good, but its hardly funtional. If you put any heavy clothing on it, it will tip over. Its rickety. It has horrible plastic casters on it, which make it look cheap. It doesnt come with any spare parts so yer screwed if your phillips head brakes thru the cheap cams. I had to get a 3 inch screw to fasten it. I should of returned it, before i broke it."
3,Wait for the millennium to arrive first.,"I do not agree with all he says,and some of what he says is ""flatout wrong."" But the book is readable,and drives home the point that theonly people who need worry unduly overthe millennium enjoy the luxury to thinkabout it."
3,Confusion about two different books,"Another reviewer has reviewed a different book. ""Reviewer: Trevor J Hall (see more about me) from PERRY,, ME USA At last the two books of the life of the mutant prince of the House of Lin have been combined in one cover....""This is actually a review of _Empire of the Atom_, an SFnal re-telling of Robert Graves's _I Claudius_, and a quite different book, also by Van Vogt.As to the books at hand, they are some of vV's best, but suffer from all his characteristic faults -- the too frequent plot changes, the endless consipiricies (often where the leaders of two opposed sides are secretly the same person) a society whose economic basis is dubious at best. But it is a page-turner, and one that keeps this reader returning from time to time. A classic that any SF fan should read sometime or other."
4,Great product,"I previously used armor all ultra shine wash and wax until today. Today I used meguiars NXT generation car wash and so far I've been impressed. The armor all wash left a glossy shine but the meguiars wash leaves a deep, brilliant paint shine. Its more of an authentic shine in my opinion. The exterior plastics look better too after using meguiars NXT versus the armor all wash. Overall I'm pleased with the results."
1,Hard to use,"I bought some of the ones where you squeeze the air out and you don't have to use a vacuum. What a joke. The instructions said to roll it to squeeze the air out. I spent about 25 minutes trying that and basically put my sweater into a ball at the end of the roll that wouldn't lie flat. I never did get all of the air out of the bag either. I bought four bags and tried all four with the same slow compression. I will be returning them tomorrow. I think I'll just try a regular garbage bag, it's the same concept."
3,Use with Caution,"Overall, I like using the Space Bags. They are especially useful when packing heavy jackets. However, I have encountered several problems. First, one of the zippers broke off. Then, I had one stolen from my hotel room in Europe. I was using it as a shelf liner and placed my shirts on top of it.. I came back and it was gone. I'm not quite sure exactly why a maid would chose to steal a space bag but whatever. I also would advice against putting them in a garage or attic. Rats chewed ours up to make a nice comfortable, waterproof, dust proof, and dirt proof space for themselves. On the other hand, maybe they were trying to make a miniature version of the bag to sell to all their rat friends."
1,Not at all what I ordered,"I ordered what appeared to be a set of space bags according to the way the site is set up, however, all I received is 2 bags for $23.oo. Outrageous - I would never have ordered this item if it had been represented correctly."
5,A disturbing but excellent book,Child abuse is unforgivable and this book pulls no punches in describing what it is and showing the visible effects. If you are involved in the care of other peoples children I can recommend it.
5,Bright Star Timer Candles WAY COOL!!,"I bought these candles to replace window candles that were worn out, and I particularly liked the idea that once they were set, you didn't have to mess around with separate timers. I plugged them all in and then went and hit my main power at the time I wanted them to come on, and they all come on at exactly that time each day, and go off after 6 hours. Wonderful! I would have liked it even better if the timer was programable, but they work great. I put 5 yr. LED bulbs in them, so no worries."
3,"Nice, but disappointed . . .","The candle lamps are nice, I love that they turn on and off themselves, but one of them worked for maybe 3 days. The bulb quit working, I bought another bulb, and now that one will not turn off on its own. It has to be unplugged from the outlet. Very disppointing."
5,feeling it,"my butt is firming up and feelin it(as is my dear hubbie:-) ... this workout is very good, a suprising good buns workout that is straight forward and uncomplicated. Leisa does alot of pilates based moves that really work the glutes and do youever feel it, its a great video to have!!!"
2,So Disapointing!,"Let me premise this review by stating that I love Leisa Hart and her DVDs. I am used to getting either a solid cardio workout or solid sculpting workout from her, but this DVD delivered neither. If you're looking for some sexy stripper moves, then this is a good one, but if you want a workout, then skip it."
2,dime store quality..,"well you get what you pay for,these lights belong in some import store,the paint was already gone from the center of the back of the light i guess what ever company in taiwan builds these ---- things dosent even wait for the paint to dry to package them.i started to bead blast them and repaint them but i think ill just wait and see how long they take to rust,besides i think it would be a waist of paint.save your money or go to the big crate store they cary better quality than this.this is the last thing i buy that says procomp on it.."
2,"Again, what bonus?","Me again, still saying ummm... hello? What bonus? DO I DISAPPOINT YOU? is track one on the regular US CD, at one quarter the price. And the so-called IMPORT DVD included here is in NTSC format, the US format, so where's it imported from? Canada? And what are the four songs on the DVD, and how long does the DVD run? For thirty extra bucks, it should be a whole concert, not 4 short songs. Where was this mini-concert? When? How about a little real info, not just some back-handed insult about fairy dust! Rufus and his fans are real people! We deserve better than this!"
2,Bad watch,"I bought this watch over a year ago, and it began running slow within 10 months. I replaced the battery but it's now running slow again 5 months later. Even the watch or the seller is a dud; hard to tell."
3,Nice Contemplation,"for under twenty dollars this cd package offers 42 traditional italian/neopolitan selections. The recordings are very clear but mostly quite old and sound it. Many of the great italian singers/tenors are represented including Enrico Caruso, Beniamino Gigli, Giuseppe Di Stefano, Mario Lanza and Luciano Pavarotti to name just a few. I suppose it is nostalgic to hear these older versions but I actually prefer the 16 track cd of Dominic chianese's ""ungrateful heart"" which is a nice modern yet folk-like versions of tradtional neopolitan fair. Still if you don't want to invest a lot of cash this is a nice collection for the price and a great introduction to many of the older tenors."
2,"Sony does it again....the drive is good, the package is not","If you purchase this drive, be prepared to go buy other burner software to get it to work at it's potential. The included software is awful. At this point, the drive is not supported by Roxio's Easy CD Creator Platinum's latest version (5.1). It does work with Nero, which I'm still learning now.When buying software, I expect there may be problems getting it to work with my hardware. But when the mfg of the hardware includes the software and it is less than adequate with only a limited trial period & built-in self destruct, that makes me want to avoid that particular mfg.Sony makes great products, but their included overall package and technical support historically is poor. This one is consistent with their tactics.Hot tip: do not buy stock in B's CD burner software."
5,excellent on-time delivery,This was for an older camera that my mother has and she couldn't find any film. She was very pleased and I was extremely pleased with the very fast delivery.
4,Researching Q's & A's About Murder,"As I embarked on writng my own True Crime book, I ended up asking more questions than my book was going to answer. I turned to David's book for help.Q&A had actually answered questions I didn't even know I wanted to know! I was especially pleased to see that my own country was low on the list of nations whose people murder infants.David draws parts of his book on statistics, which is dry, but very interesting. I am not sure how he could have done better than he has. He is thorough in his answers, however, and that is what someone researching needs. We don't want anecdotes or other storie and examples; we want facts.If you are studying law, criminal anything, police, crime writing (fiction especially!) or anything else related to murder and answers about it, this is the book you need to read."
2,Meh...,"Not much to learn here. I thought it was going to go more into how to play in the Setzer rockabilly/swing/jazz style, but it's just a book for learning how to play Setzer's solos. Save yourself some money and sit down and cop the licks on your iPod."
3,too advanced for me,no words. far too technical. just not right for my skill level. I'm sure that someone else might find it worthwhile.
5,A must for guitar players,"Very detailed and accurate transcriptions. Gives you a library of Brian's commonly used chords, even tells you what pomade he uses. If you are fan and guitarist, this is a must have."
2,Transcriptions not licks,I've been playing guitar for 50 years and I'm always interested in various styles of music. I grew up with Rockabilly music but never really learned to play some of the class licks of early rock music. The Brian Setzer book looked interesting but the title is very misleading. This is a transcription of his early recordings and solos and is not a book of classic Rockabilly Licks. There is a difference.
4,"Practical and informative, a valued addition to my library","At 48 I began looking ahead for my future as a 'senior citizen'. Mr. Hansen's book was recommended by a friend as a good resource. I found it to be practical, informative in an easy to read style. It is now a valued addition to my personal library."
2,Not so helpful,"I'm still waiting to hear whether I even passed my Dantes exam on Astromony. I used this book as well as 3 other text books on Astromony to study. I pulled WAY more useful info from the textbooks that ended up being relevant to the test. This study guide covered just a small portion and although helpful for that portion of Astromony, did not prepare me for the entirety of the test."
4,More surprises from Mr. Eno,"This was issued under the Long Now Project, with which Brian Eno is very involved. In fact, the monies raised through this cd go straight to that foundation. It is a series of different bells, with an explanation provided in the insert as to the tonal differences and how bell sounds have developed over the centuries. This lines up well with the fractals and loop projects with which Eno has been involved in the past, as he studies the points of intersection and variations/differences as the sounds progress. Not really ambient but the kind of sounds that don't dominate a given setting. Would expect to hear this in a museum or performance art setting. Recommended, if not only for being so unusual."
4,quiet,this is a profound study about bell sounds. not like eno's another ambient alubums. nelori might be in a similar line.
1,"Not a ""new"" book!","I was looking forward to purchasing this item, but after reading L. Farster's review, I decided to do a bit of research. Like L. Farster, I discovered that The Reconciliation (Imajica, Book 2) is not ""new"" book, but rather that the original Imajica (I have the hardcover from '91) has been split into two books. Thanks, L. Farster, and yes, Amazon.com should make more it clear!"
4,Not your grandmother's crochet book!,"I'm not a fan of the slippers pictured on the cover, but as soon as I looked inside, I knew I had to have this book! It's chock full of hip projects using non-traditional materials like kitchen twine, raffia, and leather. This is not your grandmother's crochet book! I encourage anyone who is sick of wading through out-dated, cheesy patterns to check out this book. Most of the projects are made from simple stitches like single and double crochet, and they are very adaptable. Most of them don't even require a gauge swatch. I won't be running out of projects or ideas for quite a while.I didn't give it 5 stars because the instructions could've been a little better. First-timers may need some supplemental explanation from other sources."
2,"Not for a ""Newbie""...","Although I love the projects in this book, and the photography is fantastic, the title and description would lead one to believe that this is a good book from which to learn crochet. I believe this was the intent of the author, but it falls short in a few areas. First, the beginning steps are explained too briefly, and leave a lot of things out. Secondly, the descriptions of the stitches are written assuming that the reader already has a basic knowledge of crochet, using terms that do not make much sense to a first time crocheter, (and with tons of typos!) ei. ""Inserting you hook into the ring, work as many stitches into the ring as your instructions tell you."" Fine for a seasoned crocheter, but a bit confusing when working stitches into a ring has never been explained!I would give this book a 4 or 5-star rating for someone who has at least basic knowledge of crochet, but for the newbie, I'd give it a 2."
4,beautiful projects,I've been knitting for a while now and I picked up this book on a whim to expand my repetoire. The projects in it are really beautiful. I had previously steered clear of crochet because I thought all crochet was ugly. I was wrong! This book is modern and beautiful. The patterns all use Rowan yarns which are expensive so be prepard to do so some sleuthing to figure out yarn substitutions. As a complete beginner I did find that I needed some supplemental how-to instructions for stuff that just wasn't clicking in my brain when reading the book instructions. A little internet searching cleared that right up and now I've already picked out about 4 projects I want to try.
2,Too simple to be interesting,"This book likely won't be of much interest to experienced crocheters, because they've probably seen the projects in similar form in some other book or magazine.The projects are mostly in single crochet, which is fine even for experienced crocheters. However, most of the projects aren't unique. For example, a granny-square throw is included, which is a ""been-there, done-that"" project for many crocheters.A large, sleek-looking floor pillow stitched out of leather is the most interesting project in the book. But the author warns the reader that stitching with leather is hard on your hands.There are some unique color combinations in the book, and the photography is well done as others have said. However, avid crocheters are focused on creating crochet projects that appeal to them -- with or without the clever camera work of a photographer or the creative staging techniques of a photo stylist."
2,simple crochet,even if your a beginer this book is just to simplethe projects were so dull I can't see myself ever doing a singlething from this book . Don't bother there are better books out there.
2,2 units didn't work for me......,"I bought 2 of these. I used 1 on a baitcaster as directed with braided line. My buddy used his on a spinning rig with monofiliment. I know they're really not designed for use with a spinning reel, but we were just letting the line out for deep water jigging.....not casting. Neither of these manual units worked.......very inconsistent and inaccurate.The one deluxe unit I bought(with the light) worked perfectly on the same exact baitcasting rig."
4,Equus,"This original and bizarre story ia as good on film as it was on the stage.Although the subject matter is disturbing-the intentional blinding of several horses by a troubled youth-themovie seems to transcend the average psyco-drama horror genre.The two stars, Peter Firth and Richard Burton, are effectiveas doctor and patient.Montgomery Clift once said ""Richard Burtondoes not act, he recites."" Burton,however, is convincing as apsychiatrist who seems as intensely fraught as his patient. There is also a good supporting cast and cinematography."
5,movie equus review,A well-directed arthouse style movie. It is disturbing but necessarily so...brilliant performance by Richard Burton!
1,Horsecr@p,"Psychobabble, bestiality, animal cruelty, and stage play adaptions.. all the ingredients for a fun family movie.In a nutshell (pun intended):A quest for freedom, ecstacy, and truth represented by a disturbed stableboy who gets off touching and riding horses in the nude, ai, worshipping them, until they come in the way of his being able to perform sexually with members of his own species, whereon he flips and gouges their eyes out. The good doctor questions the ethics of curing one with such ""true passion"".There is some interesting study of sexuality in relationship to 'religion', although other than acknowleging that it can cause repression, odd behaviour (the boy) and hypocracy (the father), I'm not sure any new ground was broken or that this movie said anything that made it worth sitting through all the other BS (see paragraph above). A long movie to sit through."
1,Equus = no good...,"The stableboy isa monster who should have been put to death for his acts. The film is a horrible waste of time, and yet another example of the worst of the '70s attempts to show how a film adaptation of a novel and stage play can be put to the screen and still manage to rope in suckers and even win some awards. These types of films generally suck plain and simple, but this is among the notoriously worst of its kind. Would you care about the boys psychological make-up and rehibilitation if he had done this cruel act to a group of children? I think not. Richard Burton is better served in films such as 'Candy' and 'Bluebeard' - Stick to comedies, horror films and period pieces and forget this bogged down, heavyweight crappola! Sentimental poop! God rest Richard Burton's soul for this one!!"
1,Sick & Twisted!,What kind of mind came up with such a perverted story line? This movie is just weird. I am a big movie fan but I wish I could take back watching this crap. Watch it if you think that someone worshipping a horse as God makes a good story? This just proves that Hollywood has made junky movies for a long time! Now I see why the Oscar Academy like it.
3,"Pretty, But Flimsy","I've gotten plenty of compliments on the look of this mousepad. The graphics are fantastic! When work gets stressful, it is always a little calming to see a relaxing scene and artistic masterpiece.However, the pad isn't very thick. Normally, this wouldn't be a problem. However, the graphics are printed on plastic. The plastic doesn't lie flat on the desk which makes it difficult to navigate a mouse. Also, the plastic is somewhat textured, so it causes the mouse some other problems.I know the purpose of it being thinner and lighter is to make it easier for travel... but it actually makes it more difficult for use. For someone like me who sits at the same desk every day, the problems using my mouse get annoying rather quickly.Maybe I should just frame the mousepad and go back to my ugly, black, foam mousepad?"
2,slides on some tables,"These mouse pads slide on some surfaces like my epoxy-finished table. However, since it's only a bit thicker than a sheet of paper, it is useful for traveling."
2,you get what you pay for,Very thin and did not last long. not worth purchasing. The 2 stars is only because I love Monet.
1,Sticky on the bottom side,I didn't know the non-slide surface means sticky! What if the glue like material dry out? Also seems smell cheap plastic and the picture not very bright.
2,Your average car polish,"It makes a nice shine, but it doesn't take out any scratches except the most superficial ones."
1,Scratch Doctor is a scam!,"Nu finish Scratch Doctor does nothing to fix scratches; tried it on some minor surface scratches on my car and I might as well used normal wax on it; it shines but the scratches are now more noticeable, not gone as this product promises! This product is nothing more than hipe! Interestingly, they offer a money back guarantee on their wax products but not on this Scratch Doctor....now I know why. Save your money."
4,Very happy with this product!,"I've tried it all...and frankly, with my mother's driving getting worse as she ages- I am just thankful I have FINALLY found something that truly DOES reduce the appearance of most scratches by easily 80%!!!! Yep. It's a keeper!!!"
5,Better Than Expected,"I was pleased with the results I got from using Scratch Doctor. I knew it wasn't going to completely remove scratches (especially the deepers ones), but it really improved them. On a black car, that's saying a lot. It also improved the look of my plastic headlights."
1,Just like any other,"This is just like any other product that claims they can remove scratches ... you wax on, wax off but the scratch never really goes away. I tried over and over again with poor results. On top of that, the package leaked during shipping, so I received a big mess."
2,Scuff Doctor should be the name of the product - Auto Zone refunded me 100%,"This is as effective as Turtle Wax Polishing Compound which costs about 3 dollars for about 2-3 times the amount of Nu Finish Scratch Doc. Either way, I'll assume that by surface scratch they actually mean ultralight superficial scuff marks. This is essentially soft-scrub for scuffs on car/boat/truck/etc paint.Don't waste your money on this product"
1,Does nothing for light scratches,Bought this item last year to remove small scratches. Did not work at all! Tried several times! Do not understand how this product can get any good reviews!I'm have waited all this time to try another product and will report my findings.
1,no even close! a scam,"I bought it thinking ""scratch doctor"" that should work! This product does not even come close to the old product I bought from TV commercial! It DOES NOTHING to those surface scratches on my car. I think this product should be placed in the car polisher catagory, not ""scratch remover"". A money scam by its label."
2,Extremely weak,"I used to use GS27 which did a good job getting out scratches. I picked up Nu Finish Scratch Dr. due to positive reviews. I was amazed at how little it did. It's like they just put their wax in a different bottle. I have an 8 r old car with all kinds of scrathes and marks. The marks I was sure the GS27 (which I'm not sure they make anymore) would have fixed, the nu finish did nothing. Might as well wipe hand lotion on the scratch. A waste of $10. I gave it 2 stars becasue it did polish out extremely faint scratches. I noticed the areas where I had worked the product had the super fine scratches that look like haze on the clear coat cleared up. But that is the only thing it is good for. If it's a scratch you can feel, then I doubt this will do anything for it."
2,good product but is not permanent,"I wanted a lasting solution sadly, this is not the one. I've followed exactly what the procedure says but after 1-2 weeks the solution wears out and the scratches shows up."
1,horrible stuff,I used the directions it said on the tube and now instead of little scratches that you notice up close they are bright white scratches that are obvious much farther away. Thank you so much Nu Finish for making my car look like crap!
1,not worth a dollar,"This product did nothing, it didn't remove and cover one surface scratch. I had small marks on the hood of my Corvette and it was a waste of money."
2,Does not live up to its name. Sorry.,"It hurts me to type this because I'm a big fan of other Reed-Union products like Nu Finish, Nu Vinyl, Cling, etc. Unfortunately, Scratch Doctor is only moderately good for scratches. It will completely remove extremely light scratches- the kind you have to get down close to see. Anything beyond that it might be able to improve to some degree, but it is still easily visible. I've found that it is about 90% effective for paint transfer from one car to another. You have to work at it, but it will do a pretty good job. Like Nu Finish Polish, it is also good for paint oxidation and haze, but that's what Nu Finish is for. Sorry Reed-Union, but this one is a dud."
1,Product Does Not Work for Any Type of Car Scratch,"After applying multiple layers of Nu Finish Scratch Doctor to several fine scratches on my Lexus IS 300, the results had no effect whatsoever. This product does not work as claimed by the manufacturer, not even for the finest hairline surface scratches. I had great expectations in this product because I have used their regular Nu Finish in lieu of regular car wax on my cars for over a decade with great success, because it lasts so much longer than regular car wax."
1,The Doctor is out!,"Simple review,it does not work,even with a buffer.I suggest you try a lite rubbing compound it's cheaper and more effective.If this doesn't work it is past the clear coat and needs a pro to remove it."
3,"""SCRATCH DOCTOR"" IS MARGINAL AT BEST ...","Numerous reviews I have read on various links claim that ""Scratch Doctor"" either works great or it doesn't work at all.My experience today - 8/11/2011 - is that this product is marginal, all depending on the depth of the scratch.If the scratch is minimal along the paint line, the product works fine. If the scratch is into the body of the vehicle - deeper into the metal - ""Scratch Doctor"" does not do it. Not even close! It does not work on non-metal components of the vehicle.There are other scratch and dent repair products on the market which I intend to try to hide or remove the deeper scratches that are on my 2011 Midnight Black Hyundai Sonata.I hope to have better success with them."
1,Keep this away from dark paint finishes,"Once again I got sucked-in by product hype (I should know better by now). This stuff didn't remove the swirl marks, was very labor-intensive and the end result was no better than when I started, except now any paint chips are a nice, bright white that stands out nicely against the dark blue. Save your money."
1,Waste ot Money and Time (no pun intended),"Total waste of time and money. Having to listen to the self-indulgent comment of band member from Mostly Autumn (not really the greatest band in the world, are they?) and a few ""rock journalists"", giving 'star ratings' to Floyd albums, really takes a lot ( a LOT) of patience.The title is totally misleading: it's not critical; it's not even a review!. It's noting more then a rip-off!Avoid this one....avoid this one as plague, unless you want to spend a lot of money of a Frisbee."
2,"Pleasant, A Fun Watch","If you are a Floyd fan this is a pleasant diversion. It is far from definitive and the 'experts' are as good as you and I (if you are a Floyd fan).With that said, it's a fun watch (I did from start to finish).I think the real value for this is probably in the $15.99 range, not the $35 range. For all except the truly avid fan, I'd pass on this. Two stars because of the value."
1,do not buy,if you enjoy a bunch of bloated english men and women yap on about stufff you already know about pink floyd this is the dvd for you....there is only 20 sec blips of live preformances mix in with people gushing over the band...it suck do not waste you money...
5,Reviewing Pink Floyd...YES!,If you are a fan of Pink Floyd...and there's only one Pink Floyd sound...then BUY IT!! You'll be sorry if you don't. This dvd set arrived quickly as a surprise for my husband..a fan.
1,Health warning. This book is biassed and highly unreliable,"Readers, beware the sound of grinding axes. This book is written by a non-Korea specialist, through the distorting prism of simplistic US-bashing. The author has previously written in similar vein on Iraq, Libya, and other sadly misunderstood folks. Critical scholarship is one thing, but this book simply imposes an agenda on the Korean situation which doesn't fit. All in all, a subtraction from knowledge."
1,"painfull bias , distorted views","Chooses to spew venom at the US for it's policy towrds NK. Highly ignorant of some serious revelant facts regarding North Korea's devlopment before the Korean War, and uses every possible chance to spread his own brand of anti-US propoganda while claiming to be ""objective""10 will get you 20 that this book can be found in most North Korean Book collections, its that distorted."
4,Awesome wooden toys!,"Plan Toys makes a ton of good quality, eco-friendly, fun toys. My child loves Noah's Ark. It's totally cute and she likes the little multi-colored animals. But beware...the one we received, was not the one pictured. We received the ""newer"" version, but I was really hoping for the original one (which is the one pictured). Nevertheless, it's still a ton of fun for us to play with."
1,This book is broken (but the content is great),"Don't buy this book. Get the electronic version instead. The paper version got messed up by the publisher -- there is text missing at the bottom of page 5, a table duplicated on page 7, text duplicated on page 59, text missing at the top of page 69. Trying to read this book is infuriating. I switched to an electronic version. These problems haven't been fixed for at least 3 years and 6 printings. Even the latest (12th printing, March 2011) has these problems.However, DO get the electronic version. The content of this book is great and worth reading."
5,Best Software Book I've Read,"I have read many books by the most respected names in software development. This book is probably the best software development book that I have ever read. The advice is very practical. Anyone developing software should consider this a must-read.The recipes will help you get your system under test. Once you have good test coverage, you will be able to modify the structure of your code without worrying that you are breaking something. You will also find yourself more productive writing new code if you can follow the advice and principles laid out in this book.You will not regret purchasing this book."
3,Interesting but not mind blowing,"Quite interesting, 1st passage describe exactly my company, down even to the same field of work ! However, while advices are useful, I didn't find this book worth the while for an advanced developper."
1,Who needs this book?,"If you're an experienced programmer, you know everything or almost everything this book has.If you're not, you'll get lost in the book.And examples in java?Yuck!You could brush up on terminology with this book I suppose.Could also be useful if you take a class on the subject or give a class or write some tools that perform the described code changes.Caveat lector I only read small part of the book so far, I'll post an update if the books turns out contrary to my review."
3,"A decent, light read","This book is decent but it doesn't break much new ground. The author has the Fowler-esque affectation of naming very simple things to create a shared and clear vocabulary (ie making a change and seeing what it breaks when you compile is now the LeaningOnTheCompiler pattern) which feels a little overdone in places.There was some good material here, but generally the best parts were where he would tie an example into a well known design principal which would be explained in a sidebar (SRP, etc). Of course, that kind of stuff could be found elsewhere in a more concise format.The book is nice in that it makes you think through the samples, I just wish there were more moments after doing that where I went ""oh hey, cool"" (there were a couple, don't get me wrong) instead of ""yeah, thats pretty much how we do it now""."
5,Excellent piece of work.,"One of the best books about design, testing, pragmatism, and overall programming. I wish I had come across it sooner. I bought it after reading through Test Driven by Lasse Koskela where he gave this book praise. Test Driven is also a very good book and I recommend it as well as Working Effectively with Legacy Code. A programming canon for sure."
5,Great book!,This is the canonical book for working with legacy code (and you can even learn some if you're not working with legacy code). I use the things I learned from it daily!
4,Something's Missing...,"Um...is it just me or does it seem like the show didn't end? Nothing in the last episode of this season was like a finale. If it was because the show was axed, they should have done a special or at least a season 6 to give it an ending. I know there were spin-offs but it's not really the same. There are tons of extras! And I am glad there is an extra about the passing of Don Adams. Is it just me, or did Agent Larabee really seem to become a strong character in this season? I would have loved to have had a season 6 with more of him!"
1,Electronic shooting gallery,"I bought this item for my 8 year old,he played it once,he says it hard to hit the target, he has to almost touch the board with the gun to get a hit"
3,"Helps with the smell, and keeps it somewhat out of sight","My ScoopFree is next to the washer/dryer, so I walk by fairly often.It's nice to keep it visually out of sight a little (slightly yellowed crystals, or before it's swept, is not something I care to see often), and it does reduce the pre-sweep odour somewhat.On the downside, it's a bit expensive for what it is, and because the sides slopes inward, I think it makes the box seem smaller for my cats. I suspect for that reason, my larger cat missed the mark a couple times, hitting the moving lid of the ScoopFree machine instead of getting it in the litter.Still use it however, for the sight and smell benefits."
5,Awesome,"These things are actually kind of hard to find so i was happy they had it. i paid retail price, so i didnt get a deal but my cat likes it and im glad i got it. it helps with the smell, but in general the litter box doesnt smell either way."
3,Litter Box Privacy Hood,I love the automatic litter box. The hood is pretty but I have found it to not be useful to me. The cat does not mind it but the box does not smell with or without the hood. I purchased the more expensive litter box because of primarly the electronic counter. I find that useful as to when to change the litter. For my grown cat I am changing the litter about ever 60-65 uses.
4,Tops the Box,"What to say about a litter box hood? <grin>Let's see...It fits.It's purple.It keeps the litter from flying all over the place.Is semi-translucent so you know if a cat is in there or not.Also, this is an essential component of the HANDS-DOWN best automated litter box on the market."
5,Highly recommend this item!,"This is my first ""electric"" litter box. I have two cats and they took to it the first day it was set up. It really decreases the usually strong smell of a litter box. It was a breeze to set up. I also purchased the tent to go on top and that has worked well keeping the litter from flying all over the cats' bathroom floor. And with the tent they can't hang their bottoms over the side of the box and accidentally leave a BM on the floor. I'm going to use rewards points from a credit card to purchase the replacement litter cartridges and that will keep the cost of maintaining it down."
4,Was great,Loved how this box helped keep the litter in the pan while we owned the scoopfree litterbox. And it didn't hold the smells in as bad as we thought it would.
4,It fits and it helps keep the litter where it should be,"First of all- I bought this because I got a new older cat from the shelter that was a olympic gold winner in flinging cat crystals EVERYWHERE but in the box. We had to vacuum daily in order to prevent the wonderful crunch under our feet. This hood eliminated the problem on 3 out of the 4 sides of the box. That is what I expected it to do and it did. It is not the products fault if the cat still flings it out the front. I also thought that having the hood might help with keeping the odor under the hood, but it really didn't do that. Overall the product worked as described but I have since removed the hood and no longer use it as our olympic flinger has passed on from cancer and my remaining cats keep their covering to a minimum. I would definitely recommend this product to any cat owner who's cat cannot keep their covering to a normal level :) Good luck."
3,"Works pretty well, but has odor issues","We purchased 2 Scoop Free litter boxes and we have 3 cats. Our cats eat wet food in the morning and graze on dry food throughout the rest of the day. They use the litter box OFTEN! Anyway, the Scoop Free works just as it is supposed to, and I really like the way the crystals absorb and neutralize the urine. As far as solid waste is concerned, however, the Scoop Free still leaves something to be desired. The feces are scooped into a small area and the crystals are supposed to dehydrate it and neutralize the odor. We find that the odor is not neutralized quickly enough and after the cats have pooped the room is stinky for at least a half hour.But overall, we like this product and the mechanism has been performing perfectly for the month we've been using it."
1,Cats hated it!!,"My two cats refused to get in the litter box after I put the hood on so off it came. Would have returned it but it is so big and I had disposed of box it came in. My mistake! I will find a shelter to donate it to if I can find one that can use it. I think it just isn't high enough for my cats to feel comfortable going into. My cats are 11 years old and kinda ""set in their ways"" so I didn't try to train them to it, maybe a younger cat would adapt to it."
1,Stinky,Terrible stinky and the cat hated it . It was only ok for 5days. Took ages to come a total waste of time and money
5,No More Kicked Out Litter,"My male cat loves to kick litter and this hood has stopped the litter from going all over the room. Other hooded litter boxes were too short and he wouldn't use them because he couldn't kick enough. This one is nice and tall and he can see through it so he doesn't feel hemmed in. No more problems! I rarely have to clean up litter from around the box; the hood does a great job keeping all the litter in the box. Overall, we are very pleased with the litterbox. Very little odor, no more scooping, and a cartridge lasts around 24 days."
4,scoop free litter box,"very convenient,probably the easiest way to pick up after cats, the hood is absolutely necessary or litter flies all over, it should have been included with the system in the first place"
4,False dichotemy.,"Dorothy Rowe has earned a great level of respect and is known as one of the wisest people to exist in the UK. I'm sure she knows much more than I do about Psychology but with this point in mind, I was particularly disappointed in chapter one's subtitle: Fight or Flight. Seriously? What about 'freeze'? Now granted, I haven't read her whole book and will create an update when I finish, but knowing that she overlooked something so fundamental to our responses makes me doubt how rigorously she assesses even some of the basics. Nevertheless, since I haven't read her whole book, I'll still give her 4 stars on good faith."
5,These are great,I was having trouble with the memorex so I bought a pack of these and they worked great and I have not had any problems with them.
4,Works great. Good value.,"I've had problems playing custom made music cd's in my Dodge Durango (stock stereo, other cars have similar problems too). This is the only blank CD I've found so far that works 75% of the time or better. These CDs are generally slightly more expensive then the cheapest blank CDs, but they are worth the added price."
5,good customer service,The package arrived sooner then I thought. The box was packaged to insure no breakage. Merchandise was in good shape.
5,It's what I ordered,"I was hoping they would have white rings like the picture but like the description said, color may vary. Overall, it's what I ordered I have to give it five stars!"
5,"The ""Original"" Pictures...","Most people know this work through its orchestral version, brillantly done by Ravel (a slightly arrogant Ashkenazy thought otherwise). Still, the Pictures were originally written for the piano.Modern digital recordings of this original masterpiece are quite difficult to find, so it is a pleasure to hear them played by a renowned Russian performer.Pletnev is a marvellous player here, taking us into all these different places using only one instrument. Not only Pletnev is a worldwide famous pianist, he is also a renowned conductor. No doubt this experience has helped him express the variety of textures that this work conveys...Also, whereas the Sleeping Beauty adaption is an agreable curiosity, but the 2nd half of CD2 provides a great opportunity to discover Tchaikovsky's solo piano works. Very interesting.The sound of this digital recording is very good, and the CD is mid priced.To paraphrase Nespresso: What else? A must-buy indeed."
3,Leaden Mussorgsky loses the music's magic,"After the glowing reviews of this recording here and with the reviews of the Evgeny Kissin piano ""Pictures"" I expected something quite wonderful. I was shocked. Had we heard the same recording? Get the recently upgraded Sviatoslav Richter Sofia recording instead. Even without stereo it will apparently always be the ""Gold Standard""."
4,Good value,"Daniel Craig is always worth watching. The story line & acting were good. I enjoy British dramas, so this was a good buy for me."
5,Old fashioned English movie,Loved this movie. It was an old fashion English sleuth movie. Reminded me of the old Agatha Christie movies. Made in 2 parts.
3,BBC Who-Dun-It,Murder mystery revolving around an abusive husband who disappears ten years earlier. An obsessed detective is convinved the wife did it but cannot prove it without the body...which was never found. An unidentifable corpse is found buried on the premises in an overgrown ice house. A BBC who-dun-it. Well done with a good twist.
4,Good story,"I bought this for Daniel Craig. It is an earlier work of his. Acting is stilted, but the story is good. Nice mystery."
3,Hometown lads done good...,"yes indeed, I have this cd, and I think you should all pick it up. These guys show musical maturity belying their actual age group, and are among the better noise-rock outfits I listen to. Good live and good on record, these guys tear it up, and they're on one of the coolest labels, BreakEven Records.you are like the air, and I can't breathe."
1,WTF ONLY !,"Bear in mind there are two mainstream applications of Tae Kwon Do, WTF and UTF (World & Universal Tae Kwon Do Federation). This video shows the forms of WTF only! Don't buy the video for its combat applications only because they are very short and they are really obvious. Furthermore it's a pitty they don't mention the Korean names of the stances/kicks/punches. The video lasts about 45 minutes."
1,Don't waste your money on this tape,"As many others have stated, the only reason I gave it one star is because 0 is not available. The so-called master in this video has spent too much time in the dojang and has no idea of what would work in the street. His movements are stiff and predictable. He demonstrates against people doing stiff TKD attacks, not against anything like what one would really encounter. When he punches, his elbow flops out to the side which both robs you of power and steals the nice crisp look which many TKD people admire. I get the impression, however, that he may have some idea of what to do in the street, but not using the techniques he demonstrates here. Unfortunately, this is an all too common trait in the TKD community - ""I'll show it to you this way, but do it another way if you want it to work"". I'm quite surprised that Paladin puts this out, since they have a reputation of producing high quality, functional material. This is not one of them."
5,Great way to teach children about God.,"Harding is to be commended for this very enjoyable and God-centered book for children. Though, I think many adults would be edified by it as well. She uses each letter of the alphabet to teach an attribute about God. The entries are simple enough to understand, yet not simplistic. They are also consitent with classic Reformed theology (but are in no way polemic). I highly recommend this to all parents who are committed to seeing their children know the true God."
4,Great book for teaching children!,Well-organized with balanced variety for putting together lessons at home or church for young children.
1,What about the support,"I find it hard to believe that the drivers for XP could take this long. I have to purchase a modem from a company that feels it's necessary to actually support new OS's. It wouldn't be a problem if the drivers didn't blue screen the system. By the way, if you ever get a blue screen in XP don't do a hard shut down or it will wipe your hard drive."
1,The speakerphone software was a frustration to me,"I purchased this modem for the speakerphone feature, but, despite dozens of hours trying to make it work, I have yet to be successful with the speakerphone. I found the software to be incompatible with MS Outlook--and even caused serious corruptions in my XP system."
4,Puppy collector,Looses a star because the face isn't as cute as the picture shows but that didn't seem to bother my son much.
3,"Decent Book, Liked it.","This book was not bad. Good stuff inside. Useful stuff. Not the greatest tho if you get a speeding ticket and want to beat it. For that, I would recommend a book by Richard Wallace called An Educated Guide to Speeding Tickets, Beat/Avoid Them. That book is very easy to read. The guy who wrote is was a police officer and knows his stuff. He wrote a very useful and helpful book. I liked his better than this one. I used this book to help a friend here in Rhode Island beat a ticket in court so I know it works."
4,Brian Calvert of Sac CA,"Iam not sure if this is the CD I have, but since Amazon does not have much in the selection for Chimaria Ide just like to reccomend them to anyonen who enjoys Cradle of filth, Slayer, Entombed etc. They are a pretty heavy band more so then slayer and COF I would say but not as heavy as say Beheaded or Cannible corpse or Emperor. Indeed a good band in a class of their own."
3,"okay, okay...","I have a copy, but I wouldn't exactly kill for one. I mean, it's nice to have if you're a Hitchhiker fan, but let's face it, reading scripts is a less-than-fascinating experience; much better to actually here the show. On the bright side, there are some humourous directions for the actors, and loads o' facts about recording the series and whatnot. You might as well try to find a copy, but it's not the end of the world if you can't."
2,Sharp LC-32D5U should be better,"We have this tv for 3 weeks. The first week the TV Guide feature worked. I tried to add a channel to the listing, did not know that Comcast Cable had to do that and something got messed up and hasn't worked since. Comcast has spend 7 hrs here and Sharp has no answers. The TV Guide does not work, the listing on the screen for the channel does not display anything. Does anyone know how the TV Guide works??? The set up on screen and in the manual does not correct anything. The cable technician came and now when you press the remote for up channel it jumps from 5 to 600 and when you press the down arrow it goes to 713, which is not down by any means. How can anything get this messed up? Thinking of returning it and have 2 more weeks. Have another call into Sharp on Tuesday to see if someone else can help. Found out yesterday they don't make this model anymore. How good can it be???"
4,I guess it does what it's supposed to do,"We've been using our Capresso S9A for over 3 years now, and have had no indications of problems with scaling, so I guess these are doing what they're supposed to. I've not been able to find these anywhere except online, and Amazon and affiliates have been very responsive and prices seem to be pretty much the same everywhere..."
5,Jura-Capresso Clearyl Water Filter,The product works well. It arrived quickly and was less expensive than ordering it directly from the manufacturer.
5,It works great,"10,052 cups as of this morning and no problems. I change the filter every time my E8 says to."
2,Clearyl White NOT Clearyl Blue,"I'm trying to make use of this in my F8, while I wait for the correct filter. This is NOT compatible with my F8, which requires a Clearyl 'Blue' filter. I might have caught that fact before opening the package and noting the difference, if Amazon included the 'White' nomenclature. Don't repeat my mistake.FYI, both filters are made of white plastic. Hats-off to Jura-Capresso for thoughtfulness."
4,It makes great clean fresh water for my coffee maker.,"I wish this wasn't so expensive, $20 bucks a pop, but I can live with it if it continues to make great water for my coffee maker to give me EXCELLENT cups of coffee."
3,"They work, but the Capresso machines still clog over time.","I don't live in an area with particularly hard water, but the filters don't seem to handle regular water that well either. It works, but after a few months (with regular filter changes) the Capresso will build up sediment and end up dripping coffee instead of gushing."
3,Fab Flashback,"If ""Sergeant Pepper"" is the Rosetta Stone of Psychedelia, then ""Time Out! Time In For Them"" can be considered a pretty pebble. It's got some neat wild riffs and wavy gravy rhythms and sincerely corny lyrics that take you right back to that bizarre moment in '68 when everyone's mind was exploding. If you lack imagination or can't seem to buck the system for even 30 minutes then you won't be groovin' with this Radical Pop Rock. But, ""If you've ever been to a wilder party... you're under arrest."" That was the tag line to the Peter Sellers movie ""The Party"" that also came out in '68. Both that movie and this disc should be experienced for their dated, modest attempts to Freak Out the masses. Most of all, the vibe is just so, ummmm... ""vibey."""
5,Good product!,"My husband has a little one shot one cup coffee maker that uses these filters. He loves the little coffee maker for one cup at a time coffee, but these filters are very hard to find in our area. So, we are happy to find them on line and they do the job perfectly (no flowing over the top of the filter with coffee grounds...)."
5,Great Filters - Arrived as Advertised,Some of the older reviews say they got only 1 box of 40 instead of the advertised 12. I want to state that I did receive 12 boxes of 40. The older reviews mention these as being sold by someone other than [...]; it looks like Amazon.com is selling these directly now so the problem has been corrected. These work great in my single-cup coffee maker.
5,Yes 12 pack of 40 filters,"I received the package of 12 packs of 40 filters eachin a timely fashion. The cost, including postage wasless than I had paid at the local store which hasdiscontinued the product."
1,Merchant short-shipped me BIG TIME,Purchased a case of 12 40-filter boxes of Militta filters and received 1 box of 40. Cannot find any way to get in touch with merchant to request fulfillment of order or to complain. My only choice is to return the damn things. Thanks a lot for making yourself available to your customers. Skip these people when you next need to buy anything they sell.
1,Misleading Ad,"I purchased this item which was described as 40 count (pkg of 12). Supposedly, it was marked down from over $20. When it arrived, there was a large box with one little box of 40 in it. Shipping and handling charges were more than adequate to ship several of the packages that they had advertised. Customer service claimed it was just a typographical error and refused to honor what they had advertised."
1,False and Misleading Listing,"Home and Beyond offers this 12 pack of coffee filters with 40 in each pack. I ordered two 12 packs of 40 coffee filters each and Home and Beyond only sent two packs of 40. Not the 24 packs I ordered and paid for. My advice is do not do business with Home and Beyond when buying these coffee filters because they do not ship what the listing says. Until Amazon starts enforcing Home and Beyond to honor what they list in their offerings, IMHO then the buyers need to go somewhere else."
1,much too small,"DO NOT BUY! These filters are about 1/3 smaller than the last No 1 filters I had (Filtropa Aroma Brown No. 1 filters). These filters are swimming in either/both of the No. 1 cones that I have and do not come close to the top of the cone. I will have to make 4 or 5 pours to fill cup of coffee. To add insult to injury, they are not returnable."
5,Melita #1 Coffee Filters.,These work great with single cup drip coffee makers with cone shaped plastic holder.Lot less mess than loose grounds and whole lot cheaper than pods.I have a Black & Decker Cup at a Time maker.Most stores only carry size 2 on up so thanks again to Amazon.
3,Coffee size 1,i only bought these because i have a newer one cup coffee maker and couldn't find round filters. They really work best in a cone type coffee machine. They are a good product if using them for the right type of coffee maker.
5,excellent filters,exactly what I wanted; fit the #1 filter perfectly; arrived very quickly; natural filters are better than the bleached white ones.
3,Not great for the keurig,"After reading all the reviews but not seeing the keurig mentioned in any of them, I decided to give these filters a shot hoping to make brewing my own coffee in my Keurig easier. However, the filters are to big and have to be formed to fit the filter basket and folded over the top or the grounds go up and over the filter into my cup. I attempted to use the filter in the cone without the filter basket but the water stream is to strong and busts a hole in the bottom of the filter causing all the grounds to end up on my cup. So to make a long story short, these are doable w/some effort but don't really work well w/the Keurig and although I will use them & not go through returning them, I probably won't buy them again."
5,Great filters,I buy these filters at Price Chopper. They are great for single cup coffee makers. I have the black and decker single cup easy brew. They work great for it.
4,small coffee filters,These small filters are impossible to buy in the grocery store. They offer easy clean up and are not bleached so do nothing to affect taste.
4,Good for Brew N' Go,"These fit the Brew N' Go well, but could stand to be a little bit taller. I like to use a lot of fairly coarsely ground coffee to make a cup, which means that my minimum volume of grounds is the maximum this filter can carry. Another half inch or even an inch would make a huge difference - there's certainly space in the coffee maker for it!If you're a normal coffee drinker, though, using fewer, finer grounds, this is an excellent choice for you."
2,Hmmm...,"Not so great. The handle is really hot. You can work around this by wearing oven mitts whenever pouring, but this gets tedious after a while.Also, the glass is thin such that it breaks when dropped several inches. Mine is broken right now :("
1,This book is a big disappointment..,"I had looked forward to reading this book and must say that I was disappointed when I finally saw it. The writing is that of a grade schooler, and the content is both outdated and simplistic. There are a number of books I've found with much more depth, including:-- Shel Holt's The Intranet Advantage-- David Garrett's Intranets Unleashed-- Joan Bannan's Intranet Document ManagementAll of the above books are available from Amazon.com and are good reading with valuable insights for intranet developers. Regrettably, the Benett book was clearly written in haste and has little value for the serious intranaut or even the newcomer to the subject area."
3,Not in great shape,"My book got here quickly, but it wasn't in the shape I was expecting. The dust jacket had a strange small drop of crusty something on it, and quite a few of the pages had been dog-eared as place holders previously. But overall, the book wasn't in such horrible shape I was super angry, but I was expecting it to be in a bit better shape."
5,A Great Way To See The World!,"Working the cruise line industry for many years, I had a chance to meet Mr. Ross and got to read first hand, his latest 2000 edition. I was very impressed by the updated information his book provides. The cruise industry is always changing and Mr. Ross has done well in keeping up with the various changes. Everything is laid out nicely with easy step by step techniques. Want a job that pays you to travel the world...get the book!"
2,Cruise Work,"I found the contents of this book to be vage and to be perfectly honest it did little to help me. I say this from the point of view of someone who had never worked in the industry. Obviously if you have experience in the Hospitality industry it will be a help but then again if you have such experience all you need is the correct contact information. In the end I did get a Job on board a ship but this was thanks to information I got from another book which i Will not mention, but overall I was dissapointented with this publication."
2,"gushy, tho fun-I didn't discover where I'd fit in",I appreciate Jim's experience as a cruise director or entertainer but I didn't get enough info on where I would fit in aboard ship with my skills. I just didn't feel confident this would help me-still researching.
1,poor outdoor night light,"I bought this headlamp based on previous reviews and thought it was reasonable priced. The purpose of the headlamp for me was to light a path outdoors at night when I am returning my horse back to his stable, about 100 yards and a uphill walk. The strength of the lamp is very weak at night, and noticed no difference if I had the light on or off. So if your buying this lamp for outdoors at night forgetaboutit. It seems to work ok indoors but that was not my intended purpose. Look elsewhere if you looking for an headlamp to light up a walk path at night. Boo boo waste of money!"
3,Light works strap doesn't,The light works perfectly although I needed to use tape to get the strap to the right size for my head.
3,"The watch band is supposed to stay on, right?","This is not a bad watch for the price. The exception with my watch is that the pin that holds the band on the watch keeps popping out. I've almost lost the watch three times. Either I have a defective piece or the Swiss Army people need to add more strength the the pin's tension. The seller was kind enough to say they would fix the problem but I didn't want to go through the hassle of shipping and the wait for return. Oh yeah, if you have less than perfect eyesight don't expect to be able to read the date. It's tiny. A magnifier over the date as I've seen on Wenger Swiss Army watches would solve the problem. Other than that the watch is not too small or too large and holds its own with jeans as well as a sport jacket."
3,Interesting idea but maybe not for a book.,"An interesting idea to take a list of contemporary writers, track them down and pester them with questions asked in the moment and then locked their answers into print... fraught with dangers is the interviewing of authors, whether such interviews shed any light on the authors work is debatable but for the most part these conversations are at least snappy. As is to be expected the quality of each interview is dependant on the response of the reader, I found a few pearls(even amongst writers I have little taste for) but also found some a waste of page space. for interest authors iinterviewed: walter abish max apple ann beattie raymond carver samuel delaney barry hannah russell hoban william kennedy ursula le guin thomas mcguane tom robbins ron silliman edmund white"
5,Important read,"Difficult to read for the first time, but ultimately rewarding. Butler draws on Wittig, Foucault, and Lacan to question our assumptions about sex and gender, and ultimately, identity itself."
1,Nonsense masquerading as substance,"Terribly written, illogically 'explained,' totally uninspired. I was forced to read this during my graduate studies. Oy vey. This text offers nothing new, nothing fresh, nothing appealing. I defy anyone to email me and present to me an original topic that this woman tackles. As for the reviewer here who wrote 'Would you attack cancer researchers for their obscure language?' No, because cancer researchers are attempting to break down complex chemical and biological processes to their simplest explanations. They strive for clarity. They attempt to explain. I know cancer researchers. I have read their textbooks. Ms. Butler is no cancer researcher. Readers and not engineers, literature is not a science. Literature is the study of the human experience and the human soul, and the pretentious Ms. Butler has shown us her soul--and we find it empty."
1,Intellectual Pretension,"This book only has one useful function, and that is to demonstrate how NOT to construct a solid, sound, logicical argument. The problem is that everything dissolves basically into Butler's bizarre form of ""logic"" and ""thinking"": ""IF this is so, then..."" Read this book and check out how often she employs this way of writing. Well...the IFS multiply and multiply, and could be thoroughly challenged and critiqued at every single stage. However, she needs these extremely thin ""IFs"" to construct the bogus positions she wants to ""deconstruct."" Her reading of Lacan--which she then goes on to ""challenge""-- is a total fantasy, specious, and wrong. How can we seriously consider anything she says when her mode of writing is so untenable to begin with? Do not be blinded by Butler's pretensions to being a deep thinker, she is not, she is merely a person with decided OPINIONS, and that's all this book is, someone mouthing off about their opinion. But it is not a real work of thought."
3,Fits snug,This brand fits more snug then the original brand that came with the vacuum. It works though.
2,This add is deciving!,It totally looks like if you order you will get 2 filters. You only get the one filter. I would have ordered a cheaper one.
2,not good fit,did not fit well within my dirt devil vacuum. it was loose and doesnt seem like it provides the necessary suction.
5,Great price.,"This was a great buy, so much cheaper than other stores. Product was new and I've never brought filters from a store again, I've been buying them from here ever since."
4,Only received one filter,"No problem with the filter. It fits and works great. My problem is with the seller. I only received one filter. Where is the second one? Looking at the reviews, I see this has happened before."
4,PERFECT FIT,THE VACUM CLEANER THAT THE FILTER FITS WAS PURCHASED FROM MY LOCAL TARGET STORE OFF THE CLEARANCE ISLE FOR $15.00 BUCKS SOME TWO YEARS AGO THE STORE WANTED $25.OO BUCKS FOR ONE FILTER AGAIN AMAZON TO THE RESCUE $20.00 BUCKS FOR TWO + FREE SHIPPING AND THEY FIT EXACTTHANKS AMAZON
1,NOT Original Dirt Devil Filters,"I received the two air filters and they are not original Dirt Devil HEPA filters. I tried one filter and it is not correct since the vacuum does not work with it (loss of suction, burning smell from the vacuum, and the filter has a plastic coating which feels completely different from the regular ""paper"" feel of the filter I bought in the store last year). I even saved my older original Dirt Devil filter and the vacuum works fine with it (before and after trying the filter they sent)."
4,"Generic, not genuine.","when I was buying it, the product description said ""Genuine Dirt Devil"". It's not. It's generic and it's made by Envirocare Technologies. The filter material feels different from the original, but it did fit the vacuum. We'll see how it performs later."
4,"Product good, packaging bad","The filters seem to be working well. They were packaged individually in a flimsy paperboard box, and then put in a bubble wrap envelope. Needless to say the boxes didn't hold up well, but the filters were not damaged. The packaging was environmentally friendly, so that is good."
1,"Off Market, doesn't fit, only one arrived","It shows two filters, I only got oneIt says they are dirt devil brand, they ain'tAND to top it off, it doesn't fit well enough in the vacuum to create decent suction"
5,Amazing deal.,These filters are perfect replacements for the factory ones that come with the vacuum cleaner. You can't loose on this deal.
5,Powerful DVD,Powerful DVD. I work on a children's psyche unit and this has been a great tool to use for depressed pts and teenagers. Also a great deal and smooth transaction!
1,Never worked,"I followed the instructions to ignore the warnings related to the uncertified driver on an Windows XP system and when I tried to set the wireless configuration through the WinXP Zero Configuration Utility, my brand new PC crashed with a memory dump. Repeated tries with different settings etc. gave the same result. Thanks to Amazon's liberal return policy, I returned it and ended up buying a Linksys USB adapter (WUSB11) which worked great out of the box."
4,"Worked like a charm, even on older computers","I bought 2 of these, along with an SMC Barricade router/access point. I had no problem setting them up at all. I used one on a Windows 2000 laptop (an older one without network card), another on Windows XP Home. I recently moved the laptop one to an older P2 Windows 98 SE, and it recognized the network first time. The only issue I had was of my own making. I have both a home network and one using MS Groups. Still, once I figured out my problem, everything worked fine. The issue I had was strictly with directory sharing, nothing else. Highly recommend!"
2,Fails when other wireless adapter work.,This adapter worked Ok for me under Win98. PC running 98 would stay connected while two XP PC's (Home and Pro) would frequently drop connections with SS1022. Friends brought over an iMac with a Airporte wireless adapter - it never dropped. Toshiba and Dell laptops with integrated wireless never drop. Email to support@speedstream.com (listed in their documentation) bounces. I've purchased two 50ft patch cables until I evaluate a replacement router.
5,This is an outstanding wireless adapter,"I have installed and used three of these adapters on 2 desktop machines and 1 laptop, running Win98, Win2000, and WinXP. The adapter is extremely easy to install, the wireless utility is very informative and intuitive, the adapter has good range and looks good. I recommend it very highly!"
3,"Sometimes works, sometimes doesn't","I bought this product a while ago because it was being clearanced out. I figured this much out from using it over the last 6 months: when the USB works, the adapter works great. When the USB doesn't work, I start tearing my hair out. The adapter needs to be unplugged at shutdown, or it won't work when you boot up. The best time to plug it in is after the system has finished booting, and you see the desktop, and the cursor is just an arrow. Do not unplug other USB devices, or it goes from working to ""USB Device Not Recognized"" or ""USB Device has Malfunctioned"". If I try to update driver, and point it to the driver directory, it can't find the driver in that directory. The range is also not as good as my Netgear usb adapter."
1,This machine sucks,"Mine broke on the THIRD use. The milk steamer doesn't work anymore, all the steam blows out of the top cap. Luckily, there is a warranty, I'm waiting for it to get fixed, or for them to give me a new one. I'll let you know what happens."
1,Smells like a tire factory in New Jersey,"Maybe there's something wrong with mine, but after leaving it open for a week to air out and running several batches of water through it, it continues to emit a rancid hot new vinyl stench. The smell comes from the reservoir, and so naturally the coffee comes out imbued with this hideous aroma. It smells like one of those Nalgene water bottles would if you heated it to 212 Fahrenheit over a camp stove. Wretched.I've used the old ECM20 heavily for a year and a half, and it's fine. I thought this was the same thing in a different package. Nope. It's going back."
1,Way overpriced,Very unhappy to have ordered this for Christmas. Three weeks and still have not received. For this price and shipping I could have purchased TWO identical machines in town.
5,ArmorAll Power Wash Gel- a great product,"This product eliminates the step of adding car clearer to a bucket and filling with water. You simply spray the vehicle with water & apply the gel directly to the wet surface, or to your wet sponge or brush that you use to wash the car. Then you rinse the car thoroughly to reveal a clean surface. I would point out that you need to rinse promptly before the product dries on the vehicle. It does a great job; however, this product is almost impossible to find in local car shops or discount stores. I found it in a local ""dollar store"" for only $1. But it was sold out by my next visit. If you can find it locally, try it, especially for $1. Will be the best $1 you've ever spent on your car!"
2,Well... at least the kid likes it,"This book is written in painfully poor verse. My boy, who was 5 or so when we got the book, liked it, though, so it's not all bad. But if you can't bear uneven meter and forced, stretched, and mauled rhymes, you may want to pass on this and find something crafted with more skill."
4,From the cover,"From the back of the book:The third edition of this book builds on the two preceding editions. Older, obsolete titles have been eliminated, and newer relevant entries substituted. The twenty-four chapters of the book remain the same, but the contents of them have often changed. The book has been ""internationalized"" wherever possible. British publishers have been added to entries, when they could be ascertained. In the case of books originally written in other European languages, the title of the original has become the main entry, and translations of it into other modern languages have been noted. The chapter on English versions of the Bible has become a chapter on modern versions of the Bible (with notices of French, German, Italian, and Spanish Bibles.) Entries have been added on lexica, grammars, and concordances for the Northwest Semitic languages. In all, an effort has been made to keep the introductory bibliography within a reasonable limit."
4,Very good Iaido reference DVD,"I was pleased when I received this DVD. The production value was better than I expected (especially compared to other martial arts videos I own). In order to really benefit, though, I recommend that you have some working knowledge of swordwork.The different shot locations gave some nice dynamics, and I appreciated the Sensei's comments on Iaido.Just the blooper clip was worth the price of admission :)"
1,"Poor, with poor bits added...","I have to agree with David Collins here. A well-made DVD with very substandard iai technique.If you have no experience of iai, then you will be knocked out the art of iai and Ms Nomura. If you have aformentioned experience, then you will do what I did - pass it around the dojo for everyone to chuckle at.Our rank beginners pointed out her terminology mistakes, poor cutting ability and overall low level of skill. She is a 6th-dan, yes. But not in iai. Go search for her on the web."
1,"Nice frame, shame about the picture!","A not badly produced and filmed DVD of utterly appalling Iaido. Here in the UK this standard would not even rate First Kyu, let alone a Dan Grade. Don't waste your money.David Collins, 5th dan Iaido, 3rd dan Jodo, Kawagishi Dojo, Cornwall, UK."
1,the art of iaido way of the sword,Very deceiving.No technical integrity in Iai moves and dvd production.
2,Blah,"I listened to the samples, because someone gave the album 5 stars... And I was bored, so I decided to see how many musicians had the word ""cotton"" in their stage name. Anyway... I haven't heard the album, but I know it doesn't deserve anything over 2 stars (if you see the big picture). The other reviewer is either a friend of the band, in the band, or insane. I think anyone can figure that out... I just get irritated when I waste my time cli8cking on something and end up reading a b.s. review. But I guess I'm really wasting more of my time writing this... bye... on to pick out the ""cottons""."
4,This Bunny Has Game,"Bugs Bunny remains as one of the most influential characters in animation. His cartoons still continue to capture the hearts of millions, and that remains the truth with each carrot in the pot.The Stars Of Space Jam Collection, consists of six Bugs cartoons that are just outstanding. Each one is still full of jam packed zaniness. From a gambling rabbit, with luck beyond his wildest dares in Barbary-Coast Bunny, to his servitude in our somewhat finest military branch, that needs to start enduring a sense of humor, in Forward March Hare, and even accidentally mistaken for by gorillas as his baby in Apes Of Wrath.Of the Stars Of Space Jam series Warner Brothers created in the mid 90's, the Bugs Bunny chapter has some of zaniest cartoons to date, all brilliantly issued to video for the very first time. This and two other chapters are worth the money."
1,MORONIC!,"This was one of the worst exercise DVDs I have ever purchased. Completely moronic! Hated it! If you want a good arm workout go with Karen Voight, Minna, or Prevention instead. Waste of my money!"
2,Difficult to follow,"I'm having a hard time doing this routine through because I can't follow the instructions very well. The camera angles change too quickly and in the middle of movements, so I can't keep oriented and figure out what I'm supposed to be doing. It's very frustrating."
1,more for show than workout.,did not like the tape at all.To much dancing movements .tape is more for show than toning.Would not recommed at all.
1,Windows 2000 Problems,"This product will NOT run with Windows 2000. If you are running Win 2K and want to buy this, make sure you get the USB version. The Parallel vesion will not work."
4,Underrecognized gem,"While the best tracks do appear on the ""Best of Tracy Nelson and MotherEarth"" CD, it is great, as another reviewer said, to have the whole enchilada. Great songs, arrangements, playing, singing....a joy to have it back."
5,Down So Low still my favorite,"The song ""down So Low' had shaped and affected my life so positively as a young girl who at the time was very much in love and jilted by my long time lover, also left pregnant. The song simply says ""It's not losing you that's got me down so low I just can't find another man to take your place."" Somehow that helped me to move on with sorrow but move on none the less. Thank you Tracy & Mother Earth."
4,of a time,"Bluesy, well sung, well played, of a time but not dated, of a time like Youngbloods might be considered, not bad company."
5,Music,So glad i found this cd. I listened to this album when i was in school. Down so low is such a cool song. Love Tracy's voice. Thanks for getting it here fast. :)
4,hard to find,"I was trying to get this book for a long time, very satisfied by book 1. When I got it (not from Amazon) didn't impress me as much as the first, but still,it is a very good book and I heartly recommend it (if you are lucky and find one)"
3,nice unit,"Never used this, plans changed after receiving it.kept it for the value... maybe use it someday,who knows but he isn't telling ;)Thanks,"
5,Historical novel re-examining the expedition's experiences,"""Not another Lewis and Clark title!"" might be the reader's initial reaction here, but wait - it's a novel, not the usual nonfiction: and further, it focuses on the man behind the Lewis and Clark famer - one Toussiant Charbonneau, Sacagawea's husband. While the grounding here is solid in scholarship, Richard Hetu's The Lost Guide is anything but difficult reading: steeped in narrative tradition it provides a fast-paced historical novel re-examining the expedition's experiences. Gripping."
3,A good follow up to 'Beyond Belief',"Petra set some high standards for themselves with their 1990 release BEYOND BELIEF. They managed to come close with this release. ""Destiny"" is a great opener and a great rock song-one of the band's best. ""Who's On the Lord's Side"" elludes to a southern gospel type thing. ""Dance"" is also one of the high points of the disc. It is full of energy and has some great hooks. ""Hey World"" is a powerful ballad/rocker in the best tradition of arena rock. Some of the others are decent, there are not really any duds here. Overall an enjoyable record-one of the better Petra albums of the last 15 years."
2,Questionable quality,"After using this coffee maker for a relatively short time (2 yrs. or less) it conked out on Christmas day. Maybe it's just as well as I have been unhappy with the design of the pot (water condenses on the cover and drips on the counter every time you go to pour a cup) and the coffee basket also drips all over the counter when you swing it out to refill with grounds. The two hour hot plate cutoff may be good for safety but if you forget to reset it, you end up with cold coffee in the middle of the moring. Cause of death appears to be the temperature sensor switch components and research tells me that parts are next to impossible to obtain and that the best solution is to junk it and replace. Needless to say, the replacement will not be Mr. Coffee!"
1,Ultralight Spin Fishing - A Practical Guide,"After reading the few reviews I thought this book was a must-read. I was so wrong. It was a complete waste of time. It might (and that's an iffy might) be good for the rank novice who's just getting into fishing. For anyone with any experience at all, and especially someone with years of ultralight experience, this book is a complete waste. You'll get a lot more for your money spent if you spend it on on lures."
2,"uhh, just find your own","it arrived dry, mostly dead. I guess i was kind of expecting that. I ordered this (because it was inexpensive) in the event that i couldn't find any once I got home for the holidays. I was making little terrariums for Christmas gifts, and I found lovely moss by a creek near my parents' home, so I didn't end up using this product, so I can't attest to whether or not the meager green bits stay green or not. Either way, just don't..."
4,"As a Guide, or to Reflect","As an advance person who has had the pleasure of working with many of the same people Joan Sullivan mentions in her book, I can personally testify to the truthfulness of ""An American Voter."" Sullivan describes the chaotic day of a political advance staffer better than anyone I have yet to read. If you are looking to do advance work, read this as a guide. If you are an advance person, read this to reflect. This one is highly recommended."
1,THE COMPANY SUCKS !,ORDERED A MELITTA 10 CUP COFFEE MAKER AND ON THE SAME PAGE WAS AN AD FOR THE MELITTA FILTERS.........THEY WERE VERY EXPENSIVE AND WHEN THEY ARRIVED THEY WERE NOT FOR A 10 CUP MELITTA.................I ADVISED THE COMPANY BUT MY COMPLAINT WENT TO DEAD EARS !BUY YOUR FILTERS AT THE LOCAL STORE........THEY ARE CHEAPER!
3,Fine product but way over priced.,"Product does exactly what it's supposed to do. Filters coffee and keeps the oil from the coffee beans out. However, I found out that my local Target store normally sells them at $3.19 per 100 count. At the time of this review, it's at $2.99. I should have done my homework."
4,Good so far.,"Just gave 2 of these chairs for Christmas. There was no assembly, other than installing the arm rests. They are very comfortable, with good back support. Very sturdy, with a latch to lock them in place when open. Can't speak to their durability yet, but they made a great first impression."
1,bolts broke,"the bolts on one of the leg broke second day out so don't recommend chair for sea waters, may be fine for on shore use"
2,Nice chair but not very sturdy,"Very nice chair. Comfortable, easy to assemble, and light weight. However, chair collapsed first time on boat. We weren't 5 miles from the dock when we hit a wave and the chair collapsed. A total loss. Probably should not sit in chair while the boat is underway. Took chair to dumpster on way home. I would recommend this chair for the deck or dock, maybe in calm water. I would not call this an offshore chair. We were definitely inshore when it crumbled. Just glad no one was hurt."
4,good for those who work in the office.,"I bought this book expecting to have a spellbook with spells for success in general, but these are more office-oriented. I don't work in an office anymore, so I don't really have a use for many of these; so I feel that perhaps a better title would've suited this book. However, I do like Dolnick's writing style, the artwork in the book and the organizations for the spells inside. Overall, a good spellbook for those who work in a competitive office environment."
2,I don't think highly of spell books,"And this one is more of the same stuff that is regurgitated in most spell books intended for mass consumption. These books are entertainment and nothing more. Real spells that work would never be written in a book for people who are not even witches! Witches closely guard their spells. This is not a book for witches, it is a book for the ""Charmed"" crowd."
2,This is a useless book.,"I really can't understand how people could find ANYTHING useful in this book. All there is to spell working is a candle and flowers? Come on.I urge you to look elsewhere. Money Magic by Patricia Telesco is good, Scott Cunningham is good, etc."
5,A great game!,"I Got this game over the weekend, and my girlfriend had to pry the controller out of my hands to get me away from it. From the beginning, there is a lot of fun to be had. Many options and areas have to be unlocked, and finding things is half the fun. it's a difficult game at times, but it's still avery enjoyable game."
4,A Muppet lover's dream,"This is a wonderful game. Although the controls can be very frustrating at times, there is so much to do on every single board, that it takes hours and hours to complete. There are even hidden bosses. I would highly recommend this game to someone who has a good background knowledge of the Muppets. The movie clips are a lot of fun, and there are many voice clips to make it interesting and fun, too."
3,Not what expected,"Having grandkids who love the muppets, I thought this would be a great game. I found they had lost interest in it quickly (unusual for a playstation game.) The reason was you had to keep your eyes on the screen constantly. The Christmas part was cute and fun, but the others ( 25 characters to choose from) became boring. They still love the Muppets, but gave the game to a friend. I was glad since it was only frustrating them."
3,Okay Game,"I have always beena fan of The Muppets but i was a bit unsure about whether or not to buy this game. I purchased this game in the end as it was quite cheap and i thought that if i didnt like it that i hadnt wasted much money, it turned out that i loved this game. You take on the role of any of 25 muppets and race throughout 24 tracks all taken from the muppet movies(Christams carol tracks are good). using funny weapons to try and get the upper hand on your oonents. Worth Buying"
2,Typical game with partially entertaining options.,"Graphics: 5/10 - The colour shading is nice when you're playing outside, but for the rest of the time, this looks pretty effortless and droopy. It's also hard to see where a passage leads.Sound: 5/10 - The usual cartoon racing score hangs in the background, while the cars don't do anything too dramatic with their engines.Value: 5/10 - Most racing games are worth the money because they're entertaining, but to make a long story short, this one isn't really worth paying for unless you're a really big fan of the muppets.Overall: 5/10 - This is the sort of game you play in the game or record store while your waiting for Mum to finish her grocery shopping. In a game where you can hardly see where you're going, is it worth even playing? Yes, but only if Mum takes a couple of hours to find a broccoli stick."
2,It definitely wasn't like Crash Team Racing,"I was hoping to find a game that would be similiar to Crash Team Racing. This was not it. After 5 minutes I turned it off. The karts wobbled so badly that it was nearly impossible to steer. Although I bought this for two grown adults, I am sure that children might find this difficult after playing CTR."
2,Hard to control,"This game is very difficult and the racers are hard to control. I got this for my daughter as a Christmas gift in 2000 and she was 7-1/2 at that time. She tried to play it several times and has found it very difficult and frustrating to play. I've tried playing it myself and found it very difficult to control. It definately is not a Crash Team Racing, which was easier to play.Unless you can get this game at a substantially reduced price or for free I wouldn't waste the money on it as it is a difficult game to play & control."
2,Hard to use for younger kids; some features didn't work,"I bought this thinking it would be a good choice for our young son. In particular, the package lists a special mode that will ""steer the car"" for a younger driver. After buying the product, it took me about 5 minutes to find this feature in the (confusing) documentation, only to find that it apparently doesn't work."
5,The future of interaction design,"This book is a wonderful look at the background and future of interaction design. McCullough provides wonderful depth of understanding for the reader on the many discipline that support interaction design: psychology, architecture, cultural anthropology, technology. Not only does McCullough draw the disciplines together nicely, it is done seamlessly to the reader.My copy is now filled with highlighter marks and it a book I will be returning to for my profession and through time. If you are a fan of well developed end notes to find further information, this book is a charm."
2,"Almost, but not quite there.....","I purchased this book for a class I was taking. It was the required text for the class. I have 15 years experience in network design and administration and recently returned to school to earn a second degree. I found this text to be overly technical for its intended audience, and would not recommend it to any instructor. Also the accompanying test bank from which an instructor can pull quiz/test questions are absolutely horrible and only serve to confuse students trying to learn."
3,Bought it for class.,I wouldn't buy this book if it wasn't required in order for a class I was taking. I thought it was hard to follow.
3,Cute Little Book,"This cute little book would make a nice gift for some special occasion, such as graduation. My own copy was a gift from a friend. It is, however, such a quick read that most persons wouldn't purchase it for themselves."
4,Allows plenty of excess material for tying shut,Easy to open and install in container. Strong enough to hold significant waste weight. Sufficient material to allow self-tying closure.
1,Get another brand,"I have gotten this style trash bag for many years- it is so easy to close and lift out of the trash container, but this brand is horrible. Glad bags of the same style are much stronger, allowing me to do things like clean out the refrigerator and not worry, where I cannot fill the hefty bags to the top with normal kitchen trash without the bag developing a hole and spilling contents on the floor. I am taking trash out a lot more frequently, thus negating the cost savings of the bags. Spend a little more on the Glad bags and keep yourself from cleaning your kitchen floor each time you take out the trash!"
4,I like the flaps,"The easy flaps work well with the type of trash can that I have. The ""elastic"" feel of the flaps make it easy (no pun intended) to stretch the bag around my trash can and once on it stays on. When I am ready to change the bag I just pop it off and tie it up. Much easier than the bags with the ties in them."
1,Did not receive Stretch & Grips as pictured,"I ordered six boxes of these bags with the Stretch & Grip feature as indicated in the picture. I really like the Stretch & Grip feature, however I learned that this bag was recently discontinued. So I looked for it online and was happy to find this supply. Unfortunately, the product I received was NOT the Stretch & Grip, but just the plain Easy Flaps, which is not what I wanted. I was disappointed that the item I got was not what was pictured, and that I had the added inconvenience of returning this item."
3,Not a fan,I usually use Glad FlexForce or Kirkland bags. Both are superior to this Hefty product. I'm only 15 bags into the SIX BOXES and am so frustrated! The bags tear when I pick up a full (or half-full!) bag of garbage out of the garbage can. I bought this because of the great price shipped to my door but now I'm finding I'm using two bags for the job and spending more than if I had stuck with Glad or Kirkland.
3,Not Bad For the Price,"Not bad, but not great. I expected it would be flimsier than others that are heavier ply. You just can't be the price."
1,Demon Lover,"I bought this for a friend who's mother was evidently in the movie. Other than that connection for her, this was a total waste of money. This makes bad movies look great. Absolutely ""no"" redeeming value. Spare yourself and do not buy, rent or otherwise see this movie."
1,The quality is godawful,"I could not watch this past the five minute mark. It is obvious that the studio simply transferred a VHS to DVD. When will be people stop doing this? How hard could it be to track down the film master and do a proper release? I had seen the ""Demon Lover Diary"" which is a great documentary on this film and couldn't wait to buy this. Well I'm going to wait til a proper release is done because the quality on this is REALLY REALLY WRETCHED. I would say worse than VHS because it rolls and flutters and looks like crap. AVOID. It is possible to find both this film and the documentary combined but amazon would probably not allow such sources to be revealed. Do a search."
5,I love my catch all floormat!,The nifty catch all floormat is a must have for any working truck. It's stylish looks and ruggedness can't be beat.
3,I would not give Paul double billing.,"Clock on the Wall sounds like Paul McCartney and is a nice song. I loved Wings and feel Paul has not been as good since. Maybe working with Denny pulled something out of him. Anyway there are some good songs on this CD and if you are a Wings or early Moody Blues fan you should like it. The packaging stinks, no information on who plays what on this CD."
2,Japanese Tears (1980) under a different title and with misleading billing,"This album is a straightforward reissue of Denny's ""Japanese Tears"", a solo album of his which has been re-re-released under many different titles, more often than not giving Paul McCartney double billing. Truth be told, there are only three songs by Wings here, hence the ""McCartney"" credit: ""I Would Only Smile"", ""Send Me The Heart"", and ""Weep For Love"", all of which were leftovers from Wings sessions between 1973 and 1979.While the music might be to your liking, please keep in mind that, if you are considering to get this because of the McCartney double-billing, you will find very little of him here."
5,excellent,I used this product when I had severe flaking a couple of years ago. The flaking was gone within two weeks and has never come back. I highly recommend this to anyone as the product to use when others don't work. It does.
3,Watch the size!,"The product itself is great. I ordered this in March and received an 11 ounce bottle for about $25. When I reordered, the size had changed and I got only a 7 ounce bottle for $25. Tricky, because banner at the top of the page said I was reordering the same product so I didn't notice the size difference."
4,Dandruff Relief,"After reading reviews from other websites and blogs I decided to give this product a try. This product definitely helped me get rid of my dandruff, but if I discontinue using the product my dandruff came back! This product is not cheap and the smell is not pleasant. I'm currently trying to find a cheaper product that works as well on my dandruff as this shampoo for a cheaper price. I've already tried most of the drug-store brands and they didn't work on my dandruff at all!!!"
5,Incredible!,"I don't know what it is about this shampoo but it really knocks out the dandruff (embarrassing to admit that I have ... uh ... dandruff!) and does not diminish my bright red hair color. It is worth the extra splurge. After a short span of regular use, my hair remains dandruff free for weeks."
4,Great for hard to treat itchy scalp,This product is great to try if other medicated shampoos haven't worked. My scalp gets dry and flaky during the winter and using this a couple times a week helps to keep that under control.
4,a good option,"Honestly, I have not found a better product, but this is still a bit too moisturizing. I alternate with Mitchell tea tree which gives a really clean clean and leaves no residue. This one leaves a residue that can cause bumps."
5,Works,I only use a little bit (about the size of a quarter in my palm) every shower and I have experienced no dryness/irritation/flakes since using. Definitely something I will use as long as it is sold.
2,Horrible product,This product didn't work a waste of money I wouldn't ever buy it again. I thought that it would but damage my hair even more
2,Not Reccomended,"When I bought these, they worked fine, for the first two weeks. Then they stopped working, unless I was within two feet of the person holding the other radio. I replaced the batteries and everything, but it still didn't work. I don't reccomend this product."
1,Waste of money,"These radios were a waste of money! We bought this item forour son and promptly returned it. It claims to have a range of up to2 miles, but even in the same house, the clarity of the voices wasmuffled. As for distance, we lost communication a few houses down theroad. We have since purchased a .... 2-way radio for a comparableprice and are pleased with the huge improvement in clarity and range."
2,Please don't spend your money with the RipGO!,"Well, I bought one of this, at the beginning I was very excited, that was a really cool device, until I started to use it, then start the deceptions, first it don't support in anyway the Mini CD-RW, second belived or not it don't support the Mini CD-R of 210MB and this two problems Imation can not solve with an update of firmware, so if you buy this product you have to stay with 185MB discs, because the larger ones don't work on the RipGO they are really a headache. Sorry to dissapoint to the fans of the RipGO.En resumen no gasten el dinero en el RipGO, no soporta los discos especificados antes solo el de 185MB CD-R, y ya hable con Imation y no pueden solucionarlo con ninguna actualización de firmware, así que, así queda hasta que dure."
1,Unfriendly software,"Unless you are an expert in software development, don't buy this product. Installation is very unfriendly, nothing works, nothing connects. I wasted the whole evening trying to make it work and eventually had to return it."
4,Hubble Space Telescope: New Views of the Universe,"This is a lovely collection of the best of the Hubble photographs that had been done at the time of publication. Although they have been seen many times, and in many different formats, this book puts them all together in one place. It's too bad that some of the more recent spectacular Hubble shots weren't included, but the author's deadline was probably the culprit; it wasn't as a result of deliberate omission. This is, perhaps, a ""coffee table book"", but unlike most books that fall into that category, this one is paperback and very affordable. I can't wait for Mark Voit to do a Volume 2!"
2,Disappointing,"The layout of the book was disappointing. Instead of being a coffee table book containing mostly the latest, prettiest photos, much space was wasted on perfunctory texts containing little new information to space buffs, and the layout of the pictures was poorly judged, in my opinion, with several oddly-angled pictures splayed across the pages. There were too few large-scale photos, and most had been published in popular magazines."
3,Good but not great,This is a good book of hubble shots but not what I was hoping to find. I think Cosmos book put out recently has better pics than this does. It does give information and stuf in it but it isn't all that comprehensive.
1,Waste of money,"Very hard to buff out, leaves a splotchy look but it will fill any small nick in the paint leaving an extremely bright white spot. I did one front quarter panel and the hood ( f-150) then I stopped the results wear just horrible. This is one of the worst auto products I've bought.."
4,"Easy on, easy off, but...","Pros: goes on very easily with hand applicator, wipes off very easily, good shine (especially after buffed with electric buffer), does not stain plastic or trim, excellent Consumer Report review.Cons: 1) dries very fast. With the wax I used to use I could put on the wax and I had a minute or so to ""work it in"". It's difficult to do that with this wax because it dries so fast. 2) It was more difficult to apply this wax with an electric applicator that previous waxes I have used. Because it dries so fast and because of its consistency this wax is better applied by hand.Advice: Apply by hand. Work in small patches instead of an entire piece (ie, hood). If using an electric applicator apply the wax directly to the applicator, not to the car and then spread the wax."
2,"Hmm..more of a ""Drag Queen"" (No offense meant!) CD","I was thinking this more ""club techno"", but this is more of the techno that I hear when seeing a drag show. Kind of flamey. Nothing wrong with drag queens, just wasn't what I was looking for."
3,"Helpful, but needed something stronger...","This item works, however, I suffer from recurrent yeast infections. I think it's more effective than Monistat. Yeast infection treatments differ from woman to woman."
3,Hooray!,Now I get to buy the same album a THIRD time! Remix albums are so much better than new material!
3,Gorillaz are undefineable,"Ths album, with its drugged out dub sound, truly shows how genre-bending the group is. Although I don't consider it the best album of theirs, (its a little too slow and red-eyed hippie for me), I appreciate where they go with these remixes look forward to the next remix album of theoir mainstream releases."
4,Good but we need new material,"Being a big fan of nu-metal and 80's metal I still do not understand how I got into the gorillaz. I absolutley loved The first album and g-sides so I was obligated to get this album. The new remixes in some cases are the same. I was really impressed with remix of Man Research ( monkey racket). It is one of my favorite songs on the original album and the way they remixed it on this album stays true to the original but yet its so much different. I was however disapointed in the way they remixed soundcheck(gravity)it sound extremly different but the bass is great. In overall Id have to say this is a great CD for car systems. There isnt that many words but there is alot of infectous beats and low rattling bass. This album is a must for hard core gorillaz fans and people with systems in there car. Until they come out with there new movie and soundtrack I will still be singing, ""She turned my dad on"". In a minor note I wasnt impressed too much with the artwork either."
1,TJ,"These songs have been stretched beyond worth. It's time for some new recordings folks. This is a cheap shot to get more $ outa ya for the same ol' stuff. The first album rocked out, but this is a joke."
5,new Classic Dub Reggae,"I bought this cd on a whim when it came out, having heard ( and seen the video for ) Clint Eastwood.I have since bought the original Gorillaz cd, and I must say I prefer this over the original, being a big fan of dub reggae and chill-out type grooves. This is AWESOME. If you have the original Gorillaz cd and appreciate the diversity of the songs, you will more than likely not get into this one, as the songs admittedly all sound somewhat the same, they all have a very laid back reggae groove to them. But I can highly recommend this for fans of dub reggae."
5,This is a masterpiece,"The progression of my purchase: this album, then gorillaz 1 & 2. Yeah gorillaz know how to kick it, but this album? I go through life with a soundtrack, and this cd isn't going anywhere, anytime soon. Cmon, lets face it y'all, there is <way> more to reggae than we think. This is just a step in a new and right direction. Mixing the low bass and mystical fog feel of dub with the feel good sound of reggae, and a splash of dance, this is it. There's nothing better than a 20 minute instrumental, with smooth tunage and sounds out of nowhere to mezmerize the soul.If you dig this, you should pick up the Dead 60's dub/extended version of their only album. Plus, Reggae From Finland, out last year. Soul Captain Band, and a plethora of dub djs (plus hot smart women) make Finland worth visiting..So yeah, buy this. And Spacemonkeyz? PLease make more of this!"
4,What do People Expect From a Dub Album???,"I have read a handful of reviews now that have been not so fond of this CD. Well, I have to respond by asking, ""what is it exactly that you are expecting from a Dub CD?"" I mean, this think has all the bases covered in an effort reminiscent of the Mad Professor/Massive Attack 'No Protection' CD from a couple years back. I really liked this album, but I am very picky about going with 5 stars unless I am completely blown away... But nonetheless, if you are not expecting some dance remixes (check out the G-Sides album for that) or to completely recognize all the songs then check this out. It's dubalicious!"
3,Fair,"Well, I'm a fairly good fan of the quite interesting and ""different"" band known as the Gorillaz. I've never known what quite to classify them as. Rap? Rock? Techno? And the fact that their members remain almost anonymous (I'm sure everyone knows its Damon Alburn as vocals) makes them all the more interesting.This CD reminds me of G-Sides...its just a remix album. Although there aren't any new tracks, there are some wonderful tight remixs and some out right bizzare/awful remixes. This CD is perfect...only if your a hard core fan of our animated friends."
2,not much here for non-reggae fans,"What can I say... I loved the debut Gorillaz album that this is based on, but this isn't my cup of tea. Unless you are a big reggae fan, you shouldn't get this."
1,DON'T DEAL WITH the seller any_book under ANY circumstances!,any_book is the worst seller i have had the displeasure to deal with . EVER. its a month later and still nothing. i haven't even gotten a response from them. avoid at all costs!
2,A dissapointment to all Gorillaz fans,"I don;t like this cd at all. It is nothing compared to their other albums. So, never buy it! The only good songs are LIL DUB CHEFIN and FISTFUL OF PEANUTS. HORRIBLE!"
3,TDK SA90 High Bias Cassettes (5-pack),"I ordered these tape cassettes for my husband. He was disappointed in them, stating that the quality of the cassettes is NOT what it used to be.Nevertheless, since his favorite brands are getting more and more difficult to find, we'll probably still have to use them. And for that, he is appreciative with at least finding these."
5,Unbeliveable!,"This man was unbeliveable. He was a superman-superstrong, and he knew just what to do to win. The book is excellent reading, with an insite into the SAS in world war two. Paddy Mayne was a really interesting individual. I recommend this book."
4,An Okay Book,"The book Secret Sacrament is a good book. It isn't exactly fantasy it's more spiritual. It also described a story of a very pressured kid. The book is exciting and interesting. Especially the olden times the setting is in. The thing that amazed me the most is the healing and the power of reading dreams. The main character is Gabriel a young boy that doesn't want to be a tough macho man he wants to be a peaceful healer. In this story some major problems are that the empress Petra has a crush on a simple healer like Gabriel. Another problem is that his uncle wants him to be a man by following his father's foot steps in honor of his death, but Gabriel has another idea by the way his life is going. I give the book 4 stars out of 5. It's a pretty good book."
3,Makes you cry...,"This is a good book, not one of my favourites, but at the end it made me cry. Its a well thought out book, with a good story line.Although it was good, and I would recomend you read it, just get it out of the library."
4,"Gabriel was strong enough to follow a ""different drummer.""","There is an ancient prophecy in Navora that the downfall of the empire will be brought about by the rise of the conquered and banished Shinali people. When he was little, Gabriel had tried to run away from his father. During his escape he watches from cover as an escaping Shinali woman is attacked. Gabriel begins to have dreams which he finds he cannot understand. After his father dies, Gabriel disappoints everyone but his mother, by refusing to take over his father's business in Navora.Gabriel earns the chance to receive healer training. He is happy with his training when a chance meeting with a Shinali girl changes his life and his views. He begins to think that he may be the agent in the prophecy who will bring about war.A good, exciting tale about the abuses of power, two different societies and values, and the person who must make the choices which will determine the future of both."
2,vigilante,low budget filmaking not at its best. kudos to the film makers however for finding ways to finance a the film anyhow but really just a Death Wish knockoff. non original.even the commentary was boring. nowhere worth the retail price.
2,A movie that is boring as hell with very little good action scenes,"This movie has a good story and all, but its mass amount of filler, lack of action scenes, average action and its slow pacing that make it a bit boring to watch.While it does have some cool moments, which are the ones where Fred Williamson's vigilante character and his buddies start hurting and killing bad guys, but these moments are few and far between. If u want to see a really good vigilante movie, don't see this one, go see either ""Death Wish,"" or any othwe vigilante flick besides this one. 3.5/10"
1,Where's the climax?,"I sat up until 4:30AM watching this movie. The whole movie idea seemed good, and I kept waiting for the climax to come. It never did. This movie had way too many unneccessary parts and it's like they ran out of money or something and just made a hasty ending. I don't get the whole jail part and what purpose it served is beyond me. Even further beyond me is the fact that only about 25% of the movie is acually about the revenge of the husband. Why show and group of guys go around beating up drug dealers and pimps when it serves no real purpose in the storyline? It'd be OK if it had all come together in the end, but it never did. Plus, the acting was not as good as I had hoped. If someone killed my little kid and severely beat my wife I might shed a tear or two. I'd at least be a little more sad. I can't say enough about this movie. Don't waste your time."
1,Buyer Beware,"Bought this for a Christmas gift. Spent the time to put the set together but the game score module does not work properly. When we finally got it to work it lasted 10 minutes and sounded like it was sick. We replaced the batteries and cannot get the electronic module to work at all. I think the game would be fun if it worked. Explain that to a [kid] who just received this from Santa. I tried to contact Moose Mountain but their mail box is full. In reading other reviews on some of their other electronic games, they are not highly rated. Hopefully they will correct the situation or the product will be returned."
1,module doesn't work well,many parts to assemble. then electronic portiob doesn't work. sounds sick when it makes any sound at all.
1,Amazon rip off,Don't buy this product from Amazon. I bought this product because I thought I was going to receive ten blank vhs tapes instead I received one. The picture that they have is very deceptive. It clearly showed 10.
1,Improperly Advertised,Agree with the prior message. I was duped into thinking 10 VHS tapes were being sold. DON'T ORDER THIS.
1,"Unfortunately, I did not read reviews before buying","I also was misled into thinking I was getting TEN of these tapes, not one. While the tape is ok, it is absolutely not worth the price for a single basic VHS tape. I am usually a big Amazon fan, but this advertisement is very poor."
2,"For Shame, Rudy...","I was highly disappointed by this release. If you want something decent, pick up a previous disc, because this one is seriously lacking in everything that makes Wumpscut worth listening to. ""Scavenger"" is the only redeeming feature on this CD, and really, it's not all that spectacular. Listening to Bone Peeler is like opening a bottle of your favorite soda and finding out it's flat."
3,The Death Knell,"This is definitely one of the :w:eakest of Wumpscuts releases, but it's to be expected as the amazing Wreath of Barbs would be tough to follow. A track that was quite impressive though was ""Life Goes On"", it is forlornly harsh, violent but somehow peaceful at the same time. ""Crown Of Thorns"" is quite good, but it seemed to follow the same recipe that ""Wreath of Barbs"" did, just a little more evolved though. ""In The Peace Of Night"" clocking in at 8 minutes is a gorgeous piece of artfully dark music.Many of the other songs were underdramatised and lacked substance. Perhaps the new Wumpscut album will deliver where this one failed."
2,Nap time music.,"This does have its moments that give a vague reminder of earlier :W: songs, so I'm not going to say that this was a horrible album, but it did bore me pretty bad. I seriously can't believe that this was the same project that did Music For A Slaughtering Tribe. Unless you like slow and soft Industrial I'd leave this album alone."
2,The spiral down continues...,"I really tried to like Bone Peeler, I honestly did. It just did not grow on me at all like most music in this genre does. Rather than find some way to relate to the songs, pick up on a vibe to ride the album on, or even find some way to appriciate the 'artistic merrit' of the album, I only ended up feeling... cheated. The few songs on Bone Peeler that I somewhat liked ended up sounding redundant and weak. The music was not at all interesting and I swimmed around in Bone Peeler searching for something, anything to help me like the album. But alas, it ended up feeling like a very half-hearted album on the part of Rudy. And this was not the only time that Rudy would leave me feeling dissapointed. Rather, he would take it down one more notch, and take his music into another realm: That of complete and utter drearyness. One more album after this one, and I had lost all utter wanton to continue purchasing new :W: releases."
2,Oh dear.. no no no.,"I'm not going to delve into this album, as other people have already pointed out the majority of its flaws. I'll just say this -- Rudy has released some terrific stuff as wumpscut, but this is far from it. Boring. Bland. Get anything from the rest of his catalogue, but leave this one be."
1,These didn't work for me...,"I bought these after seeing all the good reviews, but these did not help me. Maybe it is an individual thing. I was still not able to digest dairy products after trying this product for a month. I was disappointed, but I did find another product that worked for me: lactase caplets. I bought the cheapest ones I could find on Amazon (the Kirkland brand), and they worked amazingly well. I took two instead of one whenever I ate dairy, just because I wanted to make sure there was enough lactase in my stomach to digest whatever lactose I had eaten. If this product did not work for you, I recommend looking for lactase caplets, especially the generic kind because of the price!"
3,So far after two weeks.,"Its OK, its for my son and I and my wife need to be consistant about giving it to him everyday. Saying all that I don't think its enough to get him through the day and he will need a regular lactose pill."
4,Great help for lactose intolerance,"This product really works well. It was getting so I couldn't eat anything with dairy in it. Now I can eat cheese and most other things. If I go for ice cream or something with concentrated cream, I take an extra pill (or a Lactaid) and that helps. It's not perfect, but it's way better than anything else I've tried and I've tried many options."
4,"Winterborn, susan carroll",True to form for Carroll. I have read the entire series of The Bride Finder and wanted more..good reading.
2,Very Disappointed,"After reading Bride Finder and Night Drifter and a few of her Harliquin books I was very disappointed in Winterbourne. It started out good, but then halfway through it lost something. I found I didn't even care about the characters anymore and really just skimmed through to the end. But this was an earlier book and maybe if I hadn't read Brider Finder and Night Drifter first I would have enjoyed this one more. Please don't pass up this fantastic author because of Winterbourne. Brider Finder and Night Drifter were 5 Star books in my opinion and I am eagerly waiting for her next book. This one, however, I would say pass on it."
2,Bouncy?,It is a pain to inflate.And I am VERY leary of using it. you have to put that sharp thing back in it to keep it deflating.. what if it pops and that thing jabs into you???
3,bang a gong... get on.,a tasty offering all the way from South Jersey/Philadelphia. amertume serves up the heavier side of powerpoprock stylee in excellent fashion. Mad ups to the boys.and I used to the think it was POWERLIFT...
5,Snow in Miami,For those of us who watched the TV series and were thrilled by the sounds of tubs lopeing the Ferrari along Miami's streets this is your soundtrack. Nothing another line and some cash couldnt solve..this is your CD. Great CD..a must have!
5,Awsome music!,"If you were a fan of the show or still watch re-runs, then this music is for you! Perfect combination of songs and music that you can listen to anytime, anywhere."
4,Liked it,I liked this cd but it is to much like the others I have .I was looking for new music from the show and I have most of this on the first Miami Vice CD. Nothing really new maybe a few songs but good anyway.
5,awesome!!!!,"this music is full of electricity.it defines the 80's as a time of fast living,cars and women.no doubt it will always be a favorite of mine"
5,Great condition,I love this soundtrack and the condition of this CD was great. Great music for the commute...plus a time-warp back to the 80's!
3,Nice,"I thought this CD was only Jan Hammer themes but find out there are more musics of other people, I would be more happy if this CD were only Jan Hammer musics."
2,Anemic,"I basically bought this CD for the Miami Vice Theme Song. There are a few good songs, but I'm a little disappointed overall."
1,Awful,"This is the cheesiest music ever. Phil Collins, Glenn Frey, Chaka Khan? Are you kidding me? These were the worst artists of the 80's. Where's U2, REM, the Pixies, X, the Pretenders, Tom Petty, Prince, Springsteen, the Replacements, Husker Du? Does anyone like Rock and Roll? Phil Collins writes songs for Disney and Pixar now! What did Glenn Frey know about 'Smugglers Blues'? Do you think he was writing from the experience or from the heart? These are the worst artists, songwriters and performers of the 80's. Enjoy the nostalgia, but the art which is song is seriously missing on this CD."
3,Nostalgic; incomplete,"Captures the early (and unfortunately, the more popular)seasons of ""Vice"". The Jan Hammer instrumentals are important, as is ""In the Air Tonight"", indelibly a ""Vice"" song. Others are a waste. Strongly recommend ""Vice"" music fans who want it all should go directly to Jan Hammer's ""Escape From Television"" album (which contains other ""Vice"" instrumentals, including the all-important ""Crockett's Theme"")and go episode by episode, compiling other songs, such as Godley & Creme's ""Cry"", Dire Straits ""Brothers In Arms"", Bon Jovi's ""Dead or Alive"", etc. The show really hit its zenith, musically and creatively, AFTER ITS POPULARITY WANED."
3,Replaced my Tape,I actually owned this album at release on tape. Nice collection of songs and to this day still enjoy the Jan Hammer instrumentals.
5,VERY PLEASED,My boyfriend said he would really like the soundtrack to Miami Vice. I thought I would never find it. I did and got it in record time and at a great price. I am totally thrilled and can't wait for his reaction when he finds it in his stocking. Thanks.
4,A SEXY EYE-OPENER AND AMUSING AS WELL !!!,"this was the first book i have ever read of Henry Miller, and i was told that he was a racy and sexually explicit author... well those descriptions were definately true!!!! The different people, positions, places and parts that have sex in this book are quite amazing! I must say that even though some of the things Henry Miller describes are biologically impossible, it is interesting whether he ever tried them. If you want a book that is entertaining, much more interesting and easy to read that either of the 'Tropics', then this is the book for you."
3,Fun and sex craved,"Though I had previously read three books from Miller I did not know of this one until I found it by chance in a German bookstore. I read it in German and was intrigued by Miller's pubescent yet intelligent and amusing obsession with sex--at least the obsession is more evident here than in his other works I've read. One thing however: I had to put the book aside for about a month before taking it up once again to finish it because nothing but crazy sex scenes for 200 or so pages requires a pause! It can get to be a bit much, and is not for the faint of heart sometimes (e.g. a rape is described). I came back to the States now for a bit and looked for the book in English. The American publisher has changed the title from the original ""Opus Pistorum"" (lat. ""Miller's Work"") to a cutsy-paris-travel-guide sounding title. If you read the book you'll agree that a better title would have been ""John Thursday in Paris""."
1,Not My Cup Of Tea,"Graphic, sad sex - sad in the sense that they're usually drunk as all get out and no one seems to have any true feelings for anyone at least in what I read. I have a hard time with Miller's portrayal of women as just ""c__ts"" as he calls each and every one it seems. I kept an open mind as best that I could and read a good portion, but it was repetitive and crude. He may be one of the greats, but this is not."
2,Not a real Henry Miller book,"Save your money. If you're looking for sex scenes, the ones in SEXUS are better anyway, and that's a real Miller book. Under the Roofs was published long after Miller's death. It's some porn that he wrote for $1 a page while in Hollywood, for some wealthy gent, in the days before you could buy porn in a bookstore. Not up to Miller's standards, which is probably why it wasn't published in his lifetime."
3,A HEAD OF HIS TIME POST MODERNISMS BLANKISM,"writers craft laboratory [TRY ON A NEW PAIR OF SHOES ], MAYBE TRY A STAB AT,TITiLATION [SEXY?

4,Poignant,"Aided by wonderful watercolor illustrations, this is a heartwarming story that is just right for older children. There are several messages interwoven throughout the story - about love, friendship, compassion, and loss. The story involves a young girl, Sara, and the cheetah she finds and befriends. She helps to raise the cheetah, who she names Flag, for a few months, and her relationship with the animal brings attention to the breed. Their friendship opens the door to understanding not only for Sara, but for her classmates as well. I would definitely recommend this book - it isn't particularly long, but still manages to bring home a message about caring for wild animals."
5,Heavenly treat!,"I first tried this sprinkled on apple slices at a small eco fair. Surprise! I had to drag my husband to the booth to taste it. Now he likes to use it on honey sweetened yogurt, his favorite dessert. I love it sprinkled on apples, pears, yogurt, whatever - it adds a sensational sweetness, yet it's really only the flavors of cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, vanilla, clove, coriander subtly blended with orange peel, star anise, etc. - and the little crunchy fennelly pollen of course - positively celestial combination."
5,Authentic recipes from Germany,"I absolutely loved this book, as does my mother who is originally from Silesia, Germany (now Poland). The recipes use authentic ingredients, are easy to follow, and are indicative of the foods from all regions of Germany, not just East, West, South, North like so many other cookbooks. My father was stationed throughout Germany, so we are familiar with the different flavors of Germany and appreciated the author's broad reach so that we could sample our many favorites, and we found new ones, to. My mother is very critical (no surprise!) about German cookbooks and asked me to order this one for her birthday since she's enjoyed the recipes we've prepared."
2,Gemixte pickles,"The recipes are not bad, but using German ""translations"" of English food names, obviously with no assistance from Germans, has simply hilarious results. Someone didn't know that the word PATE, as in LIVER PATE, is not the same as PATE, meaning skull. And that is just one example of a lack of attention to detail.......I'll keep the book in my collection, but cataloged in the Humor section."
2,The Quality of these grills has declined.,"I've bought three of these grills over the past several years. The first grill lasted 4 or 5 years and operated like clockwork until it ran out of gas from old age. The second one only lasted a year. I bought a third a few months ago and right from the start, the clip holding the top grill in placed was slipping, causing the top to slip out of alignment when you closed the grill for cooking. Today, the power light went off and I have no heat even with the cord plugged in and thus cannot grill my food today. I have to replace it again. I am extremely annoyed. This used to be a quality product that I told many people about. Not any more. I am buying another brand. No more Hamiltin Beach for me."
2,going back to my george foreman,"We registered for this to replace our old George Foreman grill and I thought it would be nice to be able to take out the plates and put them in the dishwasher. It did not crisp or cook our food as well, things tended to stay soft and just get warm and the plates never got fully clean in the dishwasher anyway. I had to ask my mom to give me back my George Forman grill, I'll never stray again."
4,smaller than i expected,"it works great although i thought it would be larger than it was,but for a small family i would reccommend it highly"
3,pretty good,"The drip cup is better than a George Forman grill, but because it sits evenly on the counter, they had to find another way for the grill to drain grease. They did this by making the grill surface channels deeper left to right. The result is uneven cooking depending on what side of the grill you use. The fact that you can take out the grilling surface to wash it, is waaaayyyy better than the Forman grill! I like the timer on this grill too. Some pros and cons on this Grill."
1,Don't waste your storage space,"I bought this to make healthier meats while doing The Atkins Diet. What a Big Waste of time and money.This thing is not a outdoor grill replacement.Very easy to clean, but I haven't had anything that tasted right when using it to cook with. Mine is taking up stoarge space til I can put it up forsale on ebay or through amazon or garage sale. Don't waste your money! Cooking on the stove is much easier, and tastier!"
3,One side cooks more than the other side,"The cooking is uneven. The left side cooks more than the right side.Not any close to the outside grill taste or experience. The times mentioned in the manual for various foods is not sufficient. It says 5-8 mins for chicken breast, but it takes much longer than that. I would rather prefer those skillet or pans with grills that can be used on the gas stove."
1,Hamilton Beach Model 25327,"I read all these dazzling reviews, just goes to show you that opinions are not worth much. This is the model with removable griddle plates. The griddle is sloped to the right hand side in order to have the juices and fat go to the collection tray. Thin items such as hamburger patties, hash brown patties and other thin meats do not make any contact with the upper griddle on the right-hand side.The phenolic plastic case is cracked after 6 uses on the top. Unit heats very slowly so ot takes approximately 8 minutes to get it ready for grilling.Save that George Foreman grill- at least it heats quickly and is designed to make contact across the surface so you can cook thin items. I was looking for a larger cooking surface and the ability to remove the grill plates for cleaning and it does these things. But the loss of 1/2 of the surface area is not so wonderful.Hamilton Beach 25327 Indoor Grill with Removable Grids"
1,Awful smell,"I purchased the Hamilton Beach indoor grill after having a George Foreman grill that broke (I loved the George Foreman one). I love the removable grids which the GF grill didn't have. However, from the first time we used this HB grill, my husband and I noticed an awful smell when it cooks. It is hard to describe the smell but it isn't a 'food' type smell and it makes the food we have cooked taste funny.I have given it plenty of use hoping it would go away but it hasn't and finally last night my husband and I agreed to just get rid of it. We haven't had any good meals from this machine (and like I said, we've used it plenty of times - probably 20+ meals) so it just isn't worth using anymore."
1,Used,I bought this for my daughter and when it was delivered to her and when she opened it up she found that it had been used and was missing the extra set of cooking plates that should have come with it as did the one that I received. It was supposed to be white but it was all yellowed by someone else having used it. So I was not happy about this item at all.
2,Back to My George Foreman Grill,"I bought this grill becuase it could be taken apart and put into the dishwaher. That turned out to be one of the things I don't like about it! I'm forever dis-assembling and re-assembling the darn thing, and then it comes out of the dishwasher scummy-looking, so I still have to wash it by hand. Also, because it is level, not tilting like the George Foreman grill, juices flow out of it in all directions. It reminds me of a waffle maker that way - where you have to scrub the back and sides when you're done. Lastly, the required 5-minute pre-heating time is irritating, and then it seems to be TOO hot! It burns items easily. All in all, I found my self using it less than the George Foreman, which was always ready to go. (Sure, I had to wash it by hand afterwards, but that just made it ready for the next time.) So I'm putting this in my 'garage sale' pile, and I'm going back to George. His stuff is simple, but at least it works right!"
3,Cooker is good. Usability is bad.,"This machine cooks perfectly. The moistest chicken breasts I've had in a long time. Love pork chops, but hate all the grease, messy cleanup and smelly domicile? The Meal Maker is made for chops! BUT:- The non-slip coating is extremely thin. After 5 uses, and never touching it with metal objects, the metal underneath the coating is already starting to show in places.- The little tray for excess grease just sits there. It keeps falling out. The duct tape I use to hold it in place looks pretty.- Storing this unit on its spine works only after the halves open up a bit to allow non-desired breading additions to accumulate. More duct tape fixes this.All in all it's worth the price - even if it only gets used 100 times. But I think the non-slip coating won't last that long. Too bad."
2,Not as happy as I'd hoped,"I had the ""old"" version of this grill, that did not have removable grill plates. I'm lazy and thought the removable ones would help me keep it cleaner....well, it is cleaner, but I doesn't cook nearly as well. With the ""old"" one, I could take a rock-solid frozen chicken breast, pop it in and in 12-15 minutes it was done, and perfect! Now, the outside gets tough and the inside is barely cooked. I can't explain this, as it looks like the same heating apparatus, etc, but it happens consistently. I'm thinking of switching to another grill. Seeing as I don't use it that much due to poor results, what good is the fact it's easier to clean?!?"
2,Save your money,I originally had a similar Hamilton Beach grill- Loved it. I got this one & it is half the size. Only fit for a single person. Decided to keep it anyway since I had already thrown the old one in the trash.
2,Choking hazard!,We received this toy as a gift and our son played happily with it for months. Just today my son came to me with one of the alligator's eyes. I was easily able to pull the second eye out. Both are the perfect size for choking. BE CAREFUL!
5,we all should bump like nick,Top jazz recording by stellar jazz performer/composer who blazes new trails while paying homage to those who came before him. As good a CD as you will find .Not commercial but ever so good!
2,Misleading Add,"Add indicated ""Pack of 4"" which I interpret as 4 boxes of 100 coffee filters. Only 1 box was received and I suspect that the add mislead me to believe that I would receive 4 packages of 100. The pack of 4 was the only reason I ordered this item online.. Even though the supplier is crediting me for the shipping charg because of its late delivery, the overall rateing has been dropped to 2 based on my impression of being missled."
4,What a deal!!!!,"Best $6000 I've ever spent. I was paying $12,000 for the 4 oz size, but then I found this little gem. What. A. Steal.I'd also like to say that I would firmly like to say that there is more seaweed in this particular soap than any other soap I've tried. Having personally spent countless hours handmaking sea weed soap, let me save you the trouble.I am so glad that the seller, radioactive, is doing the world an honest and genuine service of offering this product at the reasonable price of $6000."
4,Seriously????,"LOL!!! What ""magic theater"" said!Half the stars are for the sheer 'entertainment' of this listing!Thx for the laughs!"
3,"I like this boots, good style","but the only thing is that it is not real leather as it discribed. Inside the shoes, it says 'all Manmade'"
4,It's a wood block with holes in it.,The placement of some of the slots is odd and the widths definitely seem to correspond to some Henckles set. I did have some problems owning more than one chef knife. Overall the quality of the block is excellent though.
4,country girl enters the big city,"Wow! This movie is wild. The acting and even the directing and edting isn't the best, but it keeps you hooked in once you're out the gate.I enjoyed the music and hints of black militancy. Like at one point when the main character Anna Mae(?) says the same line as Jonathan Jackson when he attempted to liberate his brother George Jackson.All and all, it's good for laughs and jokes."
4,Great,Great classic movie. Great plot & story line. This is a hard to find gem worth checking out. Glad to find it on dvd.
5,Nice Movie from the 70's,"If you love those 70's flicks then this one is a winner. I love action packed movies and typically I am not too fond of the old ones because they are not as realistic as the new age, but this one is good. It has a good meaning and it keeps you into it."
4,"Oh, what a day in the hood it turned out to be for Jesse","I was lucky, or unlucky, enough to see this movie Fri. night 3/21/08 on the TCM channel. This is what you get when you can't sleep. By the way, it was followed by Penitentiary, but I digress. This movie hooked me like a roadside fatality car accident, I didn't want to look, but I couldn't look away. The acting was awful, but the story was interesting; it showed the lengths a sister would go to for her man, when she ain't got nothing to lose and she is from ""Sippi"" or Mississippi for the unhip. And, let those last five minutes be a lesson to those of you who don't know that ""Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned"". Especially a country black woman who has robbed a bank to bring about the release of her man from the big house.I'm going to buy this movie right now so I can watch it again at my leisure with my friends."
4,Another strong re-issue by B&F,"This one is good, as is the latest Linval Thompson re-issue by blood and fire, but the variety of songs is a little lacking. There are a few tunes that are great jams, but they do 3 or 4 different cuts of the same songs with DJ and dub over the top, and it gets a little tiring, but overall it is still a strong album."
5,Hostel Part 1 & 2,I have only watched both of the Hostel movies and I have always enjoyed them. The quality is great as well. I recommend the Hostel movies for anyone that isn't easily nauseated and likes some twisted humor.
4,Could encourage credibility,"The Christian community could gain tons of milage in the area of credibility if it would only take a serious look at the issue of the sabbath. We claim to believe in the authority of scripture then toss out all reasonable interpretation when it comes to the sabbath. We don't really have anything to lose, G-d won't be offended if we own up to the myths we have created about Sunday being something special. It's time for truth. You don't have to fall into seventh day adventism to appreciate the truth this author brings. Anyone with a heart for knowing the will of G-d should at least read this book..."
4,Historically Correct,I've had this book for sometime now and historically it is 100% accurate. Dr. Bacchiscchi's research is second to none. IF someone really wants to know this book will show them the facts.
2,Jamica Blue,Kind of hokey. Really took a leap of faith to follow the story line. How many murders would it take to stop an actual concert and would a concert really be that important to ignore multiple murders.Does get some points for the Ginny character. She seemed the most real.Kind of tough going
4,Another Street Fighter game?!?,"Well, to tell you the truth, this is a pretty cool game. The graphics are up to par and the selection of characters makes its replay value pretty good as well. However, as a die hard Street Fighter fan, I guess I was kinda looking for a bit more of a fast paced fighter over a game of parry, parry, punch, block. The super moves are awesome and are really flashy, but you only get to use one throughout the duration of the ""tournament"". Plus the rating system after the fights always makes you seem like a horrible player compared to what they're looking for. All in all though, the game is worth at least checking out, and it's a definite buy for other die hard fans like myself. . ."
2,Did anyone else notice...,"...how SLOW this game is???Compared to SFIII Double Impact this game's moves like molasses! Unless I'm missing some secret code, there's no way to speed up the game play. Ugh!I really wanted to like this game, but I am disappointed to say the least. It's great to play w/Chun Li, but these other characters aren't the greatest. Stick w/Double Impact. It has better graphics and much smoother game play."
3,One flaw for me,I'm one of the biggest street fighter fans to date. I still miss all the other fights as well.But this would have worked if they had not messed Chun Li my favoirt charicter up. I can still use her alright. But with her new moves and all... its... not the same and I can't do my famouse own costum combo's like I been doing in just about every street fighter challenge i've had since the start. It always worked. now I have to rethink how I'm gonna play her...
3,Not as good as Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo,"This was a pretty good game, but it does not go as fast as I would like, and I miss the old characters. They needed to bring back the old ones, the favorites."
1,The worst street fighter ever.,First of all this has to be the worst street fighter ever for the fowling reasons.*the game is verry hard even at the easyest level.*the game is too slow this thing needs to go faster.*the rap song at the charcter select is just stupid and anoying.*when doing specals the backround isnt all specal when doing it.*the game isent even near as good as its preavous title doubble impact.*even with the arcade stick it still is hard.*specals are different and anoying.*the four new charcters are just pretty lame and arnt worth getting this game instead just becouse it has more charcters.finaly what u should do before buying this insult of a street fighter game is think about geting street fighter 3 doubble impact that is a much better game all around and is much more of a better use for your money if you are looking for a street fighter or aney 2d fighting game.
5,streetfighter3rd strike is great,This is the best fighting game I ever played.The game features great graphics excellent game play and excellent game characters.This game has a number amount of moves and good combo attackes.The game has some awsome special moves.This game is great for fighting type people not for people that dosent like fighting.The game has awsome levels the back round looks very nice great backround. This game is the greatest fighting game in the world.
4,"Not flawless, but it's the best version of Street Fighter 3","Amidst all of the other Street Fighter games, I believe this is the best one, even though it did not receive much attention in U.S. arcades. The gameplay is responsive and accurate, and the Dreamcast version is virtually arcade perfect. The only factor which keeps me from giving it a perfect score is the music (rap/R&B music in a Street Fighter game?!), and the slightly pixelated graphics. I recommend this game to hardcore Street Fighter fans, because casual gamers may just see it as more of the same. Lastly, this game must be played with an arcade stick or import controller to be fully enjoyed... the regular Dreamcast controller is just too awkward and cheap."
4,Crystal Crossed Pins Post Earrings,"I just love the earrings, how they are designed. I wear them all the time when I go bowling."
4,Definitely worth the counter space,"I was interested by this product, with all the ads how could a person not be aware of it, but I wasn't sure it would realy be worth the cost and more imporatantly the space to use and store it. Our family was given one for as a gift and now I wish I had gotten one sooner!Cooking time is fast, the fat really does drain off, the food tastes great and clean up is easy. My non-cooking daughter will even use this product (and doesn't burn down the house either!)My only complaints with the product are that there is no on/off switch or temperature control. Once it is plugged in it's on and stays on until it's unplugged.I will be buying a second smaller grill to send off to college with the cooking-challenged daughter."
1,it broke already!,"I bought this in September 2003, and loved using it. Unfortunately, it no longer works; it quit in the middle of cooking lunch! I have heard that it is made by Salton, the makers of my sandwich maker that did the same thing."
2,Counter Space User,"There is no point in having this grill. It takes up precious counter space. It smokes up the house. The food cooked on it is dry and mostly tastless.I prefer a gas grill to this. I own a gas grill, so I say, what's the point? Sorry George. I like you but this baby goes in the next yard sale."
1,Toshiba Satellite A105-S2031,"Memory manufacturer website says this memory works with Toshiba Satellite A105-S2031, however it did not work with mine."
1,Did not match decription,"ugh... I was upset when I received the modules, I ordered two 1gb, (but what was I expecting for the price?) they were NOT PNY memory modules, they were offbrand with a sticker on them that read ""constructed in the USA."" These two modules I ordered from the same buyer, and the same description, for the same price didn't even match each other. So I tried them out anyway, I figured if they would still work, fine I'd keep them. Lo and behold, they are dead on arrival. Good thing I ordered them through Amazon Warehouse and they processed the return immediately. Buyer be weary, if the price is too good, it's probably not true."
2,one was dead,"I put both of these in my laptop, and it wouldn't boot up. Pulled them and put in the original half gig stick, and all was good. So I tried one at a time and one was bad. I ended up using the one good one and the original one. Probably should sent the bad one back bbut don'tknow tho whom it should go."
1,Loss of memory,"He memory didnt work, at all! After installing it the computer didn't start. Even after replacing the old memory. I had to take it to a computer shop to have it checked and buy new memory there."
2,Check your laptop's requirements and compatibility BEFORE,"I was only able to install ONE of the two modules I bought...turns out, there are compatibility issues with my Toshiba laptop that I failed to check BEFORE I bought this item. Rookie mistake...learn from me. You might want to buy this type of item directly from your laptop manufacturer to avoid issues like this."
1,Ordered the PC@-4200 and get PC2-5300 - Twice,"Ordered the PC@-4200 and get PC2-5300 and the replacement order was the same. They do not work in my Hp Compaq 8230 lap top. Amazon is great about the screw-up, but I have wasted two weeks on this simple upgrade. Not happy. PNY needs to fix this with Amazon."
5,get it,worked well. was compatible with toshiba satellite A105.easy to install. just plug it in and that was it. very cheap for high quality
5,works great,"just as expected, it works great. I hook up my XM, and I hook up my iPhone to my car and listen in high quality.I had to download the instructions for my head unit in order to enable the AUX connection - and when my battery goes out I get to try and turn it on again. Alpine could not have made it much harder to enable, but it's not the wire's fault."
1,do yourself a favor,"Buy the real part from alpine. This product doesn't fit correctly into the Ai-Net port, once I bought the alpine product, it works perfectly."
2,not a lot of new stuff,"If you've read Glen Baxter's _The Impending Gleam_, this won't really impress you. Several of the drawings and their captions that can be found in _The Impending Gleam_ have been recycled for this book. It's true that all the drawings in this book are in color, while the ones in _The Impending Gleam_ are not, but they're still the same pictures. There are a few things in this book that I didn't recognize, but I don't think this book is as funny as some of Glen Baxter's other stuff. There's a short little story at the beginning called ""Erina Tries To Be Popular"", but it's not very funny and it's mostly just confusing."
2,HORRIBLE,"The subject review is okay, but the practice tests are flawed and the answer keys are wrong! Also, the score conversion tables are inncorrect and include impossible raw scores. There are only 85 questions, but somehow the table is out of 90. DO NOT buy this product."
1,Advertised Wrong,"The description says it fits between 12-20 inches. When I got the product it was ONLY 12 inches long. Does not fit my dog. Waste of money. It was too cheap to send back after shipping, I would only get a couple dollars back.Disappointed"
1,ANNE GEDDES EXPLOITS!,"Geddes' work is a significant breech of basic human rights. This is putrid, repulsive (and artistically boring to say the least). Life can be incredibly interesting without ""cutie"" demoralisation. You rarely come across something so lacking in taste, which both exploits young people and allows opportunistic bloodsuckers to make a huge profit...this is obscene!"
5,ONE OF MY SON'S FAVORITE BOOKS WHEN A CHHILD!,"I ORDERED 2 OF THESE BOOKS FOR NOSTALGIA. MY SON IS CURRENTLY 27 YEARS OLD AND WHEN HE WAS 4 YEARS OLD AND A TAD OLDER, HE AND I SPENT A LOT OF TIME AT THE LOCAL LIBRARY FOR YEARS ON END. THIS WAS AND HAS BEEN HIS FAVORITE BOOK (MINE ALSO!) FOR YEARS ON END,AND WHEN I FOUND 2 OF THESE BOOKS FOR SALE THRU AMAZON, I DID NOT HESITATE TO ORDER BOTH BOOKS IMMEDIATELY,THE PRICE WAS MORE THEN REASONABLE AND I HAVE BEEN WAITING TO HEAR FROM MY SON, AFTER I SENT HIM ONE BOOK. I, OF COURSE, KEPT THE OTHER BOOK FOR MYSELF AND AM ENJOYING THIS PUBLICATION IMMENSELY!KUDOS FOR THE OWNERS OF THIS SITE, AND GOOD LUCK TO THIS NEW ENDEAVOR!ETERNALLY GRATEFUL,JOANNE EMMONS"
5,Favorite Book,"When our now 25 year old son was a toddler, this was his favorite book. We read it every night for months. He loved it."
3,"Good analysis from an outside perspective, but not terribly useful","THe subject intrugued me, the authors provided lots of clear examples, but if you're looking for a ""How To"" book this isn't it. On the other hand it gives a great outsiders perspective on the recruiting industry. Worth reading if you are a recruiter, just look elsewhere for the nuts and bolts how-to."
4,"Very interesting read, even if repetetive on the main theme","I found the book to be full of useful material. Although sometimes one has climb around the author's ego, this will be one of the books that I re-read every few months."
5,Cheap CD-RW & DVD-ROM,This burner is ideal for computer users with black or silver case. Its burn speed is very fast and reliable. The software is a bit weak personally. I use Ulead for my burning needs. I bought it for the low price. An excellent choice for upgrading an older drive.
5,Perfect for the Price,Had it now in the computer without any problems. Have added it to a computer upgrade and keeps on ticking.
3,Memorex COMBO CDRW/DVD 52X/32X/52/16X ( 32023268 ),This product is what I was looking for - it can record and play CD's and it can play DVD's - except IT CAN NOT RECORD DVD's - I am using the product - I have another DVD recorder
1,The Worse Crockpot EVER Made!!!!,"After about three (3) uses, the handles on both sides of the crockpot cracked and became unusable. I droped a seven-bone roast in the middle of the floor and burned myself in the process. The only good thing about the ""worst crockpot ever made"" would have to be the durability of the ""pot"" itself. That's the only thing that hasn't broken on this ...waste of money!!!"
3,Fancy shmancy stuff,"There are some great projects, but they seemed a bit too advanced for me. I was scared to try them, fearing miserable abject failure and mockery from my mate. I don't have mosaic scissors to ""nibble"" the tiles into the proper shapes. The directions seem clear, but I think probably are for people with some experience with home crafts."
3,Recommended but not without reservations,"The grill is useful in handling small scale grill like cooking. Enough for 2 people, or 2 burgers. It cooks a nice grill including beef, chicken, fish, etc. However, it does comes with some drawbacks.First of all, in-door GRILL means there will be smoke. Not as much as those charcoal but since you do not cook out door, you do need a good range hood. So there goes your stove top.Next problem is cleaning. Thanks to the teflon coating, cleaning is relatively easy. But the designer decided to make it more challenging by disallowing you to remove the grill surface nor wash it under water. It DOES get dirty and depends on what you are cooking, it could mean a lot of work!"
5,Solid storytelling and easy vocabulary,"Having checked out many ""easy readers"" from the library for my five year old, I have to say that this one is a standout. The stories are very entertaining and surprising. My daughter wanted this book read twice to her the day I borrowed it. I also appreciate that the monster which appears in two stories is not scary-- well, he scares some of the other characters initially, but he turns out to be a good guy. Highly recommended."
2,Tough questions,"Don't buy this book if u don't want to spend time on learning the hard questions that will not appear on real clep tests. I registered for one exam of natural science and after reading this book, i felt that i did'nt know anything about natural science; cancelled and postponed the exam. But actually the exam was very easy with all the simplest and straightforward questions .The books that I felt useful for clep are Barron's , REA and cracking the clep"
1,Horrible! Nothing like the real test!,"I studied out of 7 different preparation books, and this one, by far is the worst one! The questions in this book are really difficult, tricky and unlike the CLEP exam! The questions in the actual CLEP exam arent tricky like the SAT or GRE, they are straightforward. For some reason, Peterson's has decided to put in SAT-like questions on their practice exam. This book should be thrown out of the market because its NOTHING like the real exams! I would recommend Princeton Review's Cracking the CLEP, and Review for Clep Examination by Comex Systems. The REA also writes really accurate practice exams. If you are taking English, I also recommend you purchase ""The Writer's Reference"" by Diana Hacker. That was probably the most helpful book in brushing up on your English."
5,Material Excelente - Urge traducirlo al Español,El material es excelente para estudio bíblico individual o grupal. Realmente me ayuda a leer la Biblia en 90 días. Animo a los editores a traducirlo con urgencia al Español. Gracias!
5,Sicilian Blade,"Many books teach you how to get killed in a knife fight! This short primer teaches you to win a knife fight and live using a stilletto or a large Italian Bowie knife. Italian knife fighting evolved from the Schools that taught modern Military Sabre. Rather than teaching nonsense that does not work the military utilized realistic training that is taught here. This is the traditional method and works.The system is simple, fast, efficent and easy to learn. If you have a wife or daughter and live in a Jurisdiction where handguns licenses are impossible to obtain buy your loved ones this book, learn the method and teach her. They can carry lock blade folding knife to defend themself well. A knife and or a can of pepper spray are weapons of surprise and can save yours or your loved ones life."
4,Highly entertaining and informative,"A tour de force in the deadly arts of Sicilian stilletto dueling, Quattrocchi skillfully blends the elements of death with a clear look behind the veiled culture that fosters these arts. With hand drawn illustrations Quattrocchi deftly deals with not only the physical areas of attack, but also outlines the mental savagery inherent to knife dueling. One for lovers and fighters alike."
5,"Excellent history, and fighting techniques of this art.",This book provided an excellent history and practical application of this hidden fighting art. Before reading The Sicilian Blade I had no Idea that this european art was as intricate and as deep as any Asian martial art .The history and practical application itself was worth the price of admission. Kudos to Vito Quattrocchi for this informative work on this deadly art.
4,stilletto knife book,"very informative book... i would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in having some type of knowledge of the italian,sicilian knife and it's combative applications... not for the meek or faint hearted... very realistic.. drawings are half way descent even though i thought that the pictures in the book would be live photographed pictures..... outside of that it is a good book..."
2,2 stars for watch-ability.,Previous reviews are correct this movies stinks. There was no believability to the film or the characters. The storyline made absolutely no sense. Although I muddled through the movie I would not recommend this to anyone who is a true connoisseur of the genre. For that matter I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else.The money wasted on this films special effects could have been spent on better writers! Such a shame.
5,Definately Waterproof,"I bought this card for a friend who had one of the Nokia 'N' series phones, the card was hard to find so i bought it for him on Amazon, the card works great. After getting the card, the phone fell in a river and needless to say, it drowned, the card did survive, it is still going strong. He bought another phone for the card."
2,This book stinks,"This book was written by the leading beauty expert in the Sally Beauty Supply company and is meant for nothing more than ""troubleshooting"" for common beauty problems and helping the Sally's customer find exact brand name products (that are only available through Sally stores) to help ""solve"" the particular problem. My advise? Either go into a Sally's store or your hair stylist's salon and ""Ask The Experts""."
1,An unsatisfied reader,I was looking for a How-To/Helpful Hints book insted I got a shopping guide.This book was not helpful at all.
1,It didn't help me solve my dilemma,"I needed ideas for hair how to-s and they advertised there were some, but there weren't"
3,"it was okay, but not her best","This book was entertaining because of the great storyline and the characters really brought the book alive. However, I thought the love story could have been developed a little more. Don't get me wrong; it's still a good book but I don't think it's her best."
3,Tarnished California,"California is far from perfect, but not quite as unworthy as painted. It of all states, is known as welcoming(central Valley)included.Also, a new type of wealth was created in this state."
2,"More memoir, less geography, please","Every summer brought the drive in my in-laws' car from Stockton to Santa Cruz. I was not a California native,only marrying into a California family so I was not familiar with the state's history.I just remember California seeming so vivid and alive. Joan Didion narrates her family's move west and the intertwined history of the state and her family. Not only do we learnof family, but of the changes in the society. California has always struck me as a restless state, ever on the move, turning to the next idea or trend. Didion follows her family's history, the eventual erosion of the ties to the land and agriculture and the huge immigrant wave. There are the huge industrial closedowns and the urban sprawl and growth. This is a book for anyone who loves California, but not nearly as revealing about the author nor her roots."
5,Amazing California,"I grew up in the mountains south of Yosemite in the 1950's and 60's and have lived here ever since. I've worked as a logger, carpenter, and building designer and now spend much of my time hiking the trails in the High Sierra (not in that Arizona nursing home yet).Anyway, I've had a lifetime spent drinking in the reality that is California. Reading Joan Didion's book has furthered and edified my knowledge, thoughts, and intuitions of this region. Reviewers who think she is upset or complaining are missing the point. Didion delves deep and helps people like me fill in some blanks to this fascinating human comedy."
4,Great fun!,My nephew had a grand time putting this puzzle together and identifying all the bugs. Then he turned out the lights and the bugs glowed in the dark
5,REALLY!?!?,"I find it sort of disappointing that Amazon doesn't have a ""Look Inside"" feature for this book's listing :("
3,"It's okay, but...",all of my pages are stuck together and this makes it very difficult to color. I guess that's a risk you take when you buy used.
3,Interesting Coffee Table Piece,"This is a great book to leave lying around your house in easy-to-view places like the top of a coffee table, on the couch, or bedside table. Especially if you are the type of person who is into chi1d p0rn."
5,good times,"I think this was one of the best gifts I've ever given. If you like seeing your friends and family turn red, this will surly do the trick. This book was great fun. : )"
4,I'm 47 yrs old and coloring a Vajajay,"On an over nighter with several girl friends, I brought along this coloring book. We all picked out a vagina that resembled our own. BUT there was only 1 pink crayon! Frustrating..."
4,Seems kind of fishy to me,"The ""scratch & sniff"" feature is an added bonus! You feel like you're really there! One of the bigger vaginas smells kind of familiar to me. I wonder if these pictures are based on true vaginas, or if they were manufactured."
3,Repeats? in a coloring book? really?,"Out of the 26 illustrations in the coloring book I got, 8 of the illustrations are REPEATED! That means around a third of the content is repeated!I'm not sure if I just a bad printing or if everyone else is getting repeated illustrations???I'm a bit let down by that, but now I color the repeats differently and see which one I like best.The illustrations are done excellently and respectfully, paper quality is decent, but I'm not going to try any markers as if would most likely bleed right thru!"
5,Mr. Whithers @ it again,"This is Klute as I know him--droppin the ruffest sh** around. Right off the bat--""Pos/Neg"" by Break is insane (1st listen--it blew my car speakers to all hell). As we move along thru more rude D&B--all nice, we arrive @ Mr. Amit (""Roots""), which I don't know what to call, other than absolutely sick (when I have this song playin' on my ""new"" car speakers, I have everyone pullin up aside me--from ghetto ruffnecks--to yuppy white men-to--Jamaican rude boys--askin me ""what in the hell is that nastiness?!""). A couple of trax later we have Concord Dawn (""Take Me Away""), which either makes me suicidal or extremely happy, no in between (and no, I am not manic-depressive [that's what my shrink tells me anyway]). This is jungle music at its purest, and I'll always trust Klute to give it to me."
4,Great buy,This lens is a great buy if you are looking for something to take detailed/up close shots of products or jewelry/ring shots for weddings. Very happy with this lens.
3,nice but not great,"purchased this lens mainly for close ups for wedding ring shots.. images look really nice, however this thing hunts on auto focus like none other in low light. background blends quite well when used wide open but you will want to manual focus whenever you use this lens, and don't even try to use it on a moving target.."
1,really disappointing,"I might have received a bad copy...because this macro had a really hard time focusing even in the most perfect conditions. Wasnt the body, or the photographer...tried it on two different bodies with two different sets of hands...but it still had the same problem. guess I try the L version next. Buyer beware, this lens arrived with a damaged and opened manufacturer box, and with a missing invoice. This is the third time I have received something from amazon with no invoice in the box. Looks like its on to a different retail site. really disappointed"
4,If only it were an L lens. I have to hide this one from my friends.,"I like this focal length in a macro, and I like the aperture. I wish the L series macro were not 180mm, because I want a shorter macro. But Canon, those cads, don't make a short Macro in a L Series lens. So I had to buy some plastic. Oh well. It's fine, I guess. But not as sensual as my silky smooth L lenses. As a matter of fact, I am kind of embarrassed by it's lack of a red ring, and plasticky-ness. But it works ok, and someday, I pray Canon will make me a nice L Series, honest to god METAL macro in a shorter focal length. Like 65mm, and f2.5, OK Canon gods?"
2,Tried it...but did not like it.,"I was going to purchase this lens. I went a photography store where they would let me try it on my camera. I worked with this lens for a couple hours and had pretty much decided not to purchase anything. Then, as an afterthought, I asked the clerk to let me try the ""L"" version of this lens. Well, I can tell you there is all the difference in the world with the Image Stabilization on the L lens.I have read the reviews, but believe me, the IS is worth the extra money. Glad I tested both before I purchased anything. Otherwise, I would have been sick. I love the 100mm L lens.Better test it before you purchase it."
5,a fun lens,"I have a bag full of lenses and this is easily my favorite (I'm sure I would think differently if I could afford the Canon EF 180mm f/3.5 macro.) I've really gained an appreciation for macro photography since buying this lens. There's a whole world of creative possibilties located right inside YOUR house!For the technical... This is a true macro lens. Many lenses like to claim they are ""macro"", or have a ""macro mode"" but if the lens does not do 1:1 magnification, its not true macro. This is the case with Canon's 50mm ""macro"", which requires you to purchase an additional adapter for nearly $300. You'd have saved money by just buying this lens in the first place."
4,A sharp and colorful rock,"The first macro lens I got and excellent first choice.This lens is sharp, REALLY fast and has a superb construction quality.Great option for those who don't have more money.I'm using it in almost all my wedding shoots, to get that romantic look of the couple dance without being intrusive.f2.8 rocks."
5,amazing for tiny objects and portraits!,Can't beat this lens for detail shots! I use it for close ups of wedding rings etc at weddings and it makes a killer portrait lens as well. One of the best purchases I have made for my lens bag.
5,GREAT LENS!!!,"Want to talk about sharp!! WOW, this lens is the best. I use it for everything. Macro, portraits, walk around. You can't go wrong with this lens. I think it should be a L lens. Great buy!"
3,compromise,This is a mediocre portrait lens and a not so easy to use macro. Would get the is version.half of the pictures I took were out of focus.
4,Wonderful lens!,"Great lens! I am loving it so far! I am a bit bummed I didn't spend the extra on the lens with IS. But, this one does great considering it doesn't have that feature. It's a bit tough to focus on tiny details without a tripod, but it does AMAZING for regular portraits!"
4,Nice lens but . . .,I purchased this lens primarily for use as a macro lens. Since I shoot mostly wildlife (including bugs) I thought the field of view of 160mm (used with my Canon Rebel XT) would be just about ideal. In reality the FL was not enough. I had to approach the bugs much too close and they frequently left the scene quickly. The pictures taken with the lens were extremely sharp and the bocah (out of focus area behind the subject) was very nice. I wound up selling the lens on eBay since it didn't meet my needs.
5,"Amazing lens, who needs an ""L""?","If I were to take a picture with this lens and then an identical picture with the ""L"" version of this lens and you were able to tell me what the difference is, I would seriously give you $100. Good luck. This lens is unbelievably sharp. It's like looking through a microscope. You may want to consider a set of Kenko extention tubes once you buy this, though. You'll just want to get closer and closer once you experiment with this lens.Side note, don't forget about this lens' wonderful ability to take portrait shots. Fantastic lens!"
5,Canon Lenses are great,"I chose this rating because I was very sceptical of a Canon Macro Lens without IS, in addition to being a used lens 9 years old.Not to worry; the lens performs great; looks and acts like new! I'm very satisfied."
5,excellent performance!,"Canon EF 100mm f/2.8 Macro USM Lens for Canon SLR Camerasthis macro lens is perfect for what I do!....I love the way it handles, and it does what it is supposed to do, this lens also duo's as a medium-telephoto lens for normal photography (such as portraits!) A well worth purchase!"
5,great lens,Canon EF 100mm f/2.8 Macro USM Lens for Canon SLR CamerasI bought this lens after long research. This is the best macro lens and reasonable price.After I used some time I will write more detail and put some photo .
5,Thanks Jun Yoo for the Canon Macro Lens,"HiThanks for the prompt delivery of the Canon 100 mm macro lens. I ordered it late on Monday, took delivery on Thursday and took 20-30 pictures today just to practice for this weekend photo shoot. The lens is ""as advertised""; like new. The price was great and the delivery was excellent. The lens does what I want. I am an amateur; just someone who takes photos to share with others that want to see what I see.Again, thanks"
5,great macro lens,"not as smooth as an L series, but it's a great, cheaper alternative and captures photos exactly like you'd expect."
4,great macro lens,"I bought this 2 months ago after a lot of research and I have to say that I was glad I did. It's a great macro lens. If you are considering this lens I would recommend it but be aware that you will need a tripod because there is no Image Stabilization in it. I take pictures purely as a hobby and I think I had become a bit spoiled by the IS in my other lenses.With that said, it is well-made, sturdy but a bit on the heavy side.I use it for macro work and its also great for landscapes. The color is great. On most images, I don't have to adjust the saturation at all. I also bought the lens hood and I think that has made a big difference in the color brightness.If you are looking for a great, well-made macro/landscape lens you probably won't do better than this unless you go into the L series."
2,Consider IS for Macro,"I'm new to the whole Macro photography and was really excited to open a new section with taken photo's, after saving money & a lot of reading reviews I decided to get this lens.. I don't feel like I got my $550 out of this lens in terms of what its MENT to do, with no image stabilization it is harder then an absolute hell to take a none blurry picture on a subject. When you do land a good shot the picture is amazing but after 50 try's it gets a little absurd.. The quality of this lens feels great and looks great, and to throw down $550 was a iffy thing considering I was starting out. Now I wish I would saved the xxxxx amount of money for the L version."
5,"Outstanding - an ""L"" lens in disguise!","Simply a superb lens - the images it produces are outstandingly crisp across the frame (APS-C in my case).The internal focusing of this lens really is a must for serious macro work, as it means your lens isn't moving in and out and poking the thing you're trying to photograph (or isn't scaring the subject off as it focuses). f/2.8 means great bokeh and control over depth of field, leading to some great images.Moving outside the macro world, this is also a super portrait lens and produces very flattering images with the ability to really play with the DoF and focus attention on the subject.I would recommend that you budget for the lens hood as well (I think they're essential for all lenses, frankly).Overall - I have no idea why this isn't categorized as an f/2.8L, but if that keeps the price down, then I'm all for it. You can't go wrong with this lens in my opinion."
5,A part of my standard kit,"I bought this lens 4.5 years ago and am still surprised by how crispness of my macro and portrait pictures. The background of the pictures is also nice and smooth, which makes the people or foreground objects in macros really pop. The contrast of pictures taken with this lens is also impressive. Over the years with different cameras systems I've owned I seem to gravitate towards the same basic kit to start out with: 50mm, 100mm macro and a super wide angle lens. I find this is what I shoot with a lot of the time and I'm glad I picked this lens to be in that collection as it has served me well over the years."
2,Be Prepared to be Transparent,"Ordered these bags assuming the would be white. Unfortunately, I now have a case of clear bags so for the next few months our neighbors will be able to see everything we are throwing out. I still can't find anywhere in the description where it says these would be clear."
2,"Boy, this computer sure is awful","It has been my experience that it isn't likely you have a good, reliable computer when, about four months or so after you purchase it, you have to re-boot and re-load all the system software back onto it. HP products have been the bane of my academic existence so far --- for who knows when it might seize up on you? You might be having an important conversation on IM or trying to submit an online homework or, goodness forbid, you may be near the end of writing your dissertation/thesis/presentation and were about to save it, but were too late...To conclude, there are plenty of other brands out there that are more reliable. IBM has good, solid computers and hardy printers. HP is the 'Playskool' of the computer world -- meant for toys, not for work."
1,Don't buy unless you're studying to become a doctor,"Details are very in-depth. Not recommended as a tool for an introductory hematology course because of its abundant in-depth details which causes a loss of emphasis on main concepts and characteristics. Great for students studying to become doctors, but not recommended for med-techs or patho-assistants. Not a good reference book in a diagnostic lab either, so don't keep it."
2,Late delivery,"I paid for the expedited shipping 2 - 6 days, but it took way more than that, and I didn't get it in time for when I needed it."
3,"Guns, we need guns....","Lots and lots of guns! Mostly pretty well detailed, and I have been using for a replacement to the weapons listings in D20 Modern by WOTC. Much more detailed and realistic portrayal of real-world weaponry."
2,Chronicles of the Juice Man,"I thought this album was ok, but I didn't find out until it shipped that it was the screwed and chopped version. I'm not a big fan of the chopped and screwed version. In conclusion it wasn't that good, but I got the regular album and it was very good."
2,Poor quality,"This towel/cover-up felt and looked nice only for the first few times I used it. After a few washes, it started pilling, losing it's shape and looking like a ratty old towel that I'd had for 20 years. Too bad!"
1,There are better books out there.,"I was highly disappointed in this book. I wish she would have not used any fiction at all in writing it. Also I wish she would have listed the snippets of information by the names of the people they belonged to. I'd love to know who left the TV on CNN to keep her cat company, etc. I got more information on the victims, plus pictures of most, with Portraits of Grief put out by the New York Times. There may be more names in here (I haven't cross referenced them yet) but it's the individual comments about each individual that makes for a more appealing book in memorializing the dead. I would never have bought this book had I looked at it more thoroughly in a book store."
3,"Cooks nicely, but cheap handles break with little use","I received this cooker three years ago as a wedding gift. As we are now a large blended family of five, I knew I'd need to be able to cook enough for everyone. This cooker fit the bill and has worked very nicely BUT I'm ready for a new one already. Both outside handles have broken within in the past 2 years. I never carry the cooker with food in it (as it would be too heavy and dangerous) but the handles are just cheap brittle plastic. Look for something with more sturdy handles, I know I will. Other than this minor flaw, it does cook wonderfully and we have made scores of dishes in it."
2,I've had 2 Hamilton Beach slow cookers that failed,"The base of the first one that I had literally melted. Luckily I was home when it happened. I called Hamilton Beach and they replaced it with this 6 quart model. That was about 2-1/2 - 3 years ago I think. For the first 2 years it saw some use, but not a lot. This past 6 months I've used it a lot since I now work out of the home and the slow cooker died the other day. Just stopped working, wasting the chicken inside of it. After having two of these die in short time, I cannot recommend Hamilton Beach slow cookers.If you do still consider this cooker, I would not recommend the hot setting for any length of time, and make sure you don't leave the low setting on for much more than 8 hours. It gets very hot."
1,Terrible toy!,"I have never written a review before so that should tell you how horrible this toy is. My daughter is 16 months. She actually likes the toy, well only the little buttons that play really loud annoying music things. And make animal sounds to the music. It is soooooooo loud, there is no volume. I don't mind things that make noise but this is rediculous. and the sides are very boring and like for a 6 month old. I would not recommend this toy to anyone, and it is going to grandmas house today!!!!"
2,I don't get it (and neither does my 12 month old),"Based on the glowing reviews, I really wanted to get this toy for my now 5 year old when he was a toddler but just couldn't justify the expense. Now that we've received the toy as a gift for my baby, I truly don't get what all the excitement is about. My son does like the singing animal buttons but the shape sorter side is a source of total frustration. Obviously, he's too young to unlock the door so we leave it open. But then he has a hard time keeping it open to get the shapes out and ends up ripping it off it's hinges! I'm sure that can't go on for too long before it will be broken for good. The pop-up bear side is too hard for a little one to work and too simplistic to interest an older child. The other sides are mildly interesting to me but not at all interesting to my son. All kids are different and it turns out this one would rather play with blocks, cars, balls or pans (all alot cheaper not to mention quieter, with the exception of the pans!)"
1,Looks cheap,"I ordered this toy for my 11 month old daughter. Before I ordered it I read all of the reviews and it seemed that it would be a great toy. UPS delivered the toy today and I am truly disappointed! It looks like a cheap, plastic box. My co-workers and I seem to think it's a rip off, compared to the other gifts I've purchased. I THINK I am going to give it to my daughter to play with because it seems that children really enjoy the toy, but it CERTAINLY looks like a cheap toy that was not worth the time, energy or money I spent."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this toy, sight unseen, for my son's 1st birthday, based solely on the glowing reviews. We've been disappointed with it so far. The electronic sounds are extremely loud and annoying- they play for a LONG time and there is no off switch. We had to remove the batteries because the noises scared my son. The ""telephone"" is a worthless piece of junk- there are MUCH better toy phones out there (consider the ones from Fisher Price or V-tech). My son does play with the gears and the clock a little, but it's not worth buying the toy just for that. For the same amount of money, you could buy a better shape sorter, toy phone, jack-in-the-box and still have money left over."
4,Fun but door comes off,"I got this for my daughter when she was nine months old. At seventeen months she still loves it. She has always enjoyed spinning the gears, pushing the buttons that make music, and using the play phone. Now she is able to use the shape sorter and it is her favorite shape sorter. It is easy enough for her to get the right shape in the right hole after a few tries. She also enjoys the bear-in-the-box which is better than many because it pops up when she pushes the button. Unfortunately the door for the bear comes off very easily and spends more time off than on. My only complaint is that I wish it was secured better. My husband and I also spend a lot of time gathering the shapes for the shape sorter and attempting to find the phone but I guess those items are the things that make this toy fun for my daughter.Overall it has been a very versitile toy and a good buy."
3,Decent Toy But Terrible Customer Service!,"We bought this based on the reviews here & overall its decent (though pricey). My only gripes about the toy itself would be what others mentioned about the sound level, VERY LOUD (I remedied this somewhat with a piece of packing tape over the speaker) & Im not at all happy that its made in COMMUNIST China. OK enough about that, the thing that really ticks me off is there were no instructions (not that you need them but I like to keep such things in a file in case I ever need parts, etc.). I dont know if they dont put them in the box or if they were missing but I e-mailed the company on SEVERAL occasions & NEVER heard a reply - does it take that much effort to reply to a customers e-mail? Based on the customer NO service we will not be buying any other toys from Small World Toys."
2,Loud and obnoxious,"My son likes this thing well enough, but it unmercifully has no off button. Nothing like accidentally tripping over it in the night and waking the whole house up. It's really loud and annoying. After a couple of weeks you'll hate it. But your kid won't."
4,Great busybox!,"This is a great toy, lots of things to push, turn, etc. The only thing that I would change is that it only has one block of each shape; I wish there were more. But otherwise it's terrific."
2,Not worth the money,"My daughter got this toy as a gift for her 1st birthday. It looks really cool however it did not live up to expectations. She played with it now and again, she seemed to enjoy the shape sorter part the most. However, she is almost three and the pop up part is still too hard for her to push and she is very strong. On the other hand, my 8 month old son loves using this to pull up on so it continues to have some value in our house. Of course, the person who bought it for us did so because her son loved it so it may be just the thing for some people."
1,Inaccurate description of zinc content,"Because of an article in today's paper I decided to look into zinc supplements. I went first to the web site of the guy who did the first clinical studies. His studies showed that lozenges containing zinc as zinc acetate were effective but that other forms of zinc were less effective.The Quantum product, TheraZinc, is listed on Amazon as containing zinc acetate. But on Quantum's own web site the product is listed as containing zinc gluconate. I confirmed this with a phone call to Quantum.For all I know, these lozenges will do what they're reputed to do. Just be aware that the Amazon description is not accurate."
2,Do not like the flavor/texture,"I just started taking zinc and was using zand lozenges. Not finding that brand in the store, I tried these. I was surprised that these are nothing like the zand products. These are chalky pellets and the orange flavor did not mix well with the other ingredients. Also the texture did not help my throat like zand. So gross I won't be able to use them.Amount Per Serving % Daily ValueCalories 6Total Carbohydrates 1.5 g <1%Sugars 1.5 gVitamin A (Acetate) 500 IU 10%Zinc (from Zinc Gluconate) 14 mg 93%Proprietary Full-Spectrum Premium Herbal Blend 25 mg *Slippery Elm Bark *Larch Arabinogalactan *Marshmallow Root *Mullein Leaf **Daily value not established.Other Ingredients: Sucrose, Vegetable Stearine, Natural Orange Flavor (with other natural flavors), Citric Acid, Vegetable Stearate, Silica and Lycopene."
1,BEN BAILY ROAD RAGE,"YOU SENT ME 2 & CHARGED ME FOR 2 THE DVD IS NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE!SINCERELY, JUNE P.S. I only ordered 1 ROAD RAGE DVD!"
5,CHRISTMAS PRESENT,I HEARD BEN BAILEY ON COMEDG CHANNEL ON THE RADIO AND THOUGHT HE WAS REALLY FUNNY. I HOPE MY BROTHER IN LAW LIKES IT.
5,Engaging Observational Humor from CASH CAB Driver!,"Long time stand-up comedian Ben Bailey is better known as the driver of the CASH CAB, Discovery's popular game show. And in his new stand-up special, ROAD RAGE AND ACCIDENTAL ORNITHOLOGY, he shares his experiences with hosting the show among other things. Hilarious moments include a rant on Google (""Google? What's Google? Google it and find out.""), an encounter with an owl, being ""lactose-intolerant intolerant,"" and of course his fame hosting CASH CAB, for which he won two Daytime Emmys. This special is a must for fans of Bailey, CASH CAB, or observational comedy."
5,A must have.......,"If anyone has seen 'what the bleep do we know' and liked it, this book is a must. It tells you what is happening on a cellular level in easy to read terms and how your beliefs can change your DNA."
1,"Title says ""IPHONE 3G"", text says ""NOT COMPATIBLE WITH IPHONE 3G""","very lame; the title for this item says ""FOR APPLE IPHONE 3G"", but the small text specifically says ""not compatible with iPhone 3G"". Very lame, seller."
1,JUNK!!!,The self cleaning HEPA filter does not work. After having this product for about a month I had to use my shop vacuum to clean out the filter. After 2 months the gear box failed and had to be replaced (covered under warranty) but I was without a vacuum for a few weeks. After that I was very careful and used my shop vacuum to clean out the HEPA filter after every 2 uses. It is ridiculous that you have to vacuum your vacuum when you're finished with it. After the warranty expired the gear box broke again rendering the vacuum useless.Do not waste your money on this product unless you like frustration.
1,this is the worst vacuum cleaner I have ever owned,"I started having problems with the Hoover U8351-900 Windtunnel from the start. THe self-cleaning,(yea, right, what a joke) Hepa filler clogs, and then loses suction.I took it to be repaired and the Hoover authorized service center personal told me it should never have been put on the market. He suggested that I fix it and sell it. It will never work right.Hoover should replace it for one that works. I would join in a class action suite. Do NOT BUY the [ASIN:B000FFILWO Hoover U8351-900 Windtunnel 2 Extra Reach Bagless Upright Vacuum]]. I'll never own another Hoover."
3,If you have allergies then AVOID BAGLESS VACUUMS!!!,Bagless vacuum cleaners are terrible if you have allergies! NONE of the bagless vacuums tested by Consumer Reports did well in the airbourne particle test. HEPA SHMEPA!
1,Negative 10 STARS - PIECE OF CRAP,"I can't believe Hoover, Amazon or any self respecting company still sells this piece of crap. I bought this vacuum probably 2 years ago and there were not a lot of reviews yet. I wish there had been. The HEPA filter clogs up and stops working, emptying it is dusty and messy, and now when I start the machine it sends out a cloud of dust that settles over everything in the room. Oh yeah and the handle end broke off after about a month.Today I went and bought a Dyson. It was more expensive but had outstanding reviews.Hoover should be ashamed of this product and should have issued a recall. And Amazon -- why are you selling such a piece of crap on your site?"
1,sent it back,when you go to empty the canister the dirt falls out. was not impressed and returned the item
1,I really wanted to like this vacuum,"I really wanted to like this vacuum. It looks great, has incredible suction and all the great features really work well. However, I took it back after using it twice and now own an Eureka Boss. Like most of the other reviewers, I immediately found that large amounts of dust fell down from the Hepa filter when emptying the plastic container which catches all the dirt, hair and dust and when I restarted the machine, this dust blew all over the room. Incredibly poor engineering on an otherwise useful tool. I would have thought by now, Hoover would have gotten the message :("
2,Built to bust,"The self cleaning HEPA filter motor is built to break after a period of time. I just spent the past two hours cleaning out the entire vacuum and decided to fix the filter as well. The motor for the filter still spins, but the filter does not. The reason it doesn't is because they made the motor-to-filter connector with some strategically placed holes that make the plastic break over time. Once the plastic breaks, it is no longer able to grip the filter to turn it. I am breaking it inwards and filling it with expanding glue to fix this (this should do the trick). I would be surprised if the self-cleaning worked more than a year on this model.It was also very messy cleaning, and took 25 screws to get it out (which is important if you plan on replacing the filter)"
1,WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK,This is the worst vacuum I have ever had. The power drive doesn't work properly and its hard to push around. The self-cleaning filter is anything but self-cleaning. When you take the wand out its hard to get back into place. All-in-all this thing is a disaster and I am sure glad I kept my old Windtunnel - a new brush and belts and its as good as new. DON'T BUY THIS THING!!
1,What a piece of junk!,"This is the biggest, most worthless, piece of junk I have ever purchased!The ""SELF CLEANING"" Hepa filter does not self clean.I've had the vacuum for 6 months now and have had to take it apart twice to clean it out.The Hepa filter is supposed to rotate, after it gets jammed up, the motor strips out the gear going to the motor.The owners manual says to take to a authorized repair shop any time the filter stops rotating. This would be once every 3 months or approximately 12 uses.The good news is the built in indicator to let you know when the filter has stopped turning. It is a lovely burnt electrical smell as the motor struggles to spin the nylon gear around the axle."
1,Don't even think about it.,This is my 4th Wind Tunnel and I have been satisfied with them in the past. I can't even express my disappointment with this model without using foul language. It's less than 6 weeks old. The filth and the clogging are constant. Buy another model.
2,I'm glad I kept my old windtunnel...,"The HEPA filter quits cleaning itself and you have to have a second vacuum to clean it....It is really a messy proposition to empty the bagless container....This is a truly poorly designed machine that Hoover has not given me any satisfaction on. I spend more time cleaning the wintunnel 2, after I vacuum, than I do in the actual vacuuming."
1,Would NOT recommend......,"We have had this item for less than 6 months....**DISLIKE:-filter gets clogged after 5 minutes of vacuuming-when removing the cup, dirt spills everywhere from behind the cup-hepa filter stopped working-area behind hepa filter clogs way too easily-sending it in to get fixed is annoying and it took 2 weeks (yikes!)-very heavy to push, no matter what setting you have it on**LIKE:-the extra long cord comes in handy-being able to vacuum the steps while leaving it on the landing is handy**OVERALL:-would not recommend to anyone...."
1,"very nice, until...","When I first used this vacuum I was VERY impressed. It really sucks (in a good way) and the use of the attachments is very easy. I could have lived with the rather heavy weight of the unit and even the ""exhaust"" vent being infront (and blowing pet hair away from the place I wanted to clean). But when it came time to empty the LARGE dirt cup, a bunch of dirt fell outside the cup. I thought that it might be that I over-filled the dirt cup, but no matter how much or how little I vacuum before emptying, I always end up using the dust buster to clean up the dirt that drops once the dirt cup is released. I tried shaking and pounding the vacuum before emptying to try and get the dirt to drop, but it won't until the cup is removed. I can't deal with having to constantly vacuum my vacuum. I'm returning mine."
1,If I could I will give it 0 starts,"I was really happy when I got my new vacuum cleaner (the tools, how it clean...) After 45 days... calculate no more than 18 times I used it. The vacuum doesn't work anymore the Hepafilter broke it didn't clean by itself and also the handle. It is a poor design. I called Hoover. I took it to a service center. It took two weeks to fix. I got it back and after vacuum twice, broke again. I call again Hoover ask to be exchange for another vacuum cleaner and they said they couldn't do it. If you ask me bad customer service that you don't expect from Hoover (they never were rude) since this vacuum doesn't fulfill its purpose. They should accept the vacuum cleaner has problems. Well, I took it back to service and after all this, I still have problems the dust and dirt get constantly stuck on the filter. BAD BAD!!! Don't throw your money away."
1,WHAT A PIECE OF C**P!!!!,"Never ever again will I listen to anybody who recommends a Hoover. Mine came defective. Best Buy won't help me out and this is where I purchased it. (But the Culver City, CA Best Buy is the worst on the planet). I was told to call Hoover, which I have done. I have held on the phone for 60 minutes, only then to be disconnected once they pick up. Zero customer service on their part. The second ""self-cleaning"" filter won't turn and gets jammed. I've heard now that this is a common problem. Also, it smells like it is burning. If it blows up, I'll be happy. Please please don't buy this expensive piece of junk."
1,Terrible Design,"HEPA filter clogs extremely easy and stops. This causes the suction power to decrease dramatically.We have a very clean home with one cat. The hair and dust clogs the filter and causes it to stop spinning. This spinning feature is the ""self-cleaning"" feature the HEPA filter has. Unfortunately when it stops spinning the filter clogs and the suction power decreases. I have a commercial shop vacuum and we spent over 30 minutes cleaning the Hoover Windtunnel 2, cleaning the filter out and within 10 minutes of use the filter had already stopped and was clogged again. Also as other people have mentioned just simply emptying the canister dust spills out from the clogged HEPA filter onto the floor you have just cleaned.My suggestion is to avoid this vacuum. Don't waste you money on this vacuum."
4,Pretty Reliable,"This laptop is fairly reliable and performs well - good graphics, great sound, pretty tough. There are a few minor glitches that have been there from day 1 - in particular there is a problem with the Mobility Raedon driver that no one can fix. But all the problems are mere inconveniences, nothing that will stop you from doing what you need to do."
4,Nice information but little bit confusing,I really don't know much about Chinese history and ancient technology of the world. But this book gave me lots of information about ancient technologies of Chinese and Greeks.Although I believe many Great inventions Chinese made does not get credited to Chinese such as Crossbow and firearms. But this book seems give too much of credit to Chinese invention and how it affected western technologies because many inventions are done independently.Overall it is a good book and Chinese people should be proud of what their ancestors acheived.
3,Long list of innovations if that is what you require,"This book consists of a large number of innovations that were first invented in China, typically way before the year 1000. Some background and description of each innovation is included. However, do not expect any deeper understanding of why China was so inventive in the past. The focus of the book makes it less interesting for a general audience. If you require a list of innovations this book is clearly five stars. However, this book would probably not be in my top ten to understand China. So overall I give the book three stars."
4,China is Fantastic,"China is in many ways fantastic. Joseph Needham has shown us how much China has invented mny hundreds of years before the westThe Man Who Loved China: The Fantastic Story of the Eccentric Scientist Who Unlocked the Mysteries of the Middle Kingdom. Why they then lost the advantage to the west is another unanswered question.This book is a popular summary of the 16(?) volumes more scientific book by NeedhamScience and Civilisation in China. Volume 1: Introductory Orientations. It is a faboulous read and very thought provoking, what can the Chinese achieve if they again come into this crewative mode ?"
3,Good but not his best,I am a huge fan of the Sin City Series and Frank Miller. Out of all of the Sin City Graphic novels this is my least favorite. The story isn't as rich as some of the others and the drawing style not as bold and exciting. That being said it is still worth picking up.
3,Not That Great,"I give it 3 stars only because it was entertaining to some degree but I have to say I was pretty disappointed. I just finished reading ""A Dame To Kill For"" before reading this one and that book is far superior. The story here is weaker and a lot less beleivable and even the art seems rushed. There was something great about Miller's art in ""A Dame To Kill For""- it was minimal, moody and atmospheric...but in this one it just looks overly crude and rushed."
4,Ill cut your pecker off...,"Big Fat Kill is the follow up to a dame to kill for. Dwights new girl, shellie, a waitress who is employed at Kadies, the bar nancy dances at, is being harrassed by her old lover, a police officer, Jack Rafferty. Jackie Boy, one night, comes knocking at shellies door, demanding she lets him in. Little does he know that dwight waits inside and is in the mood to kill. Old town help is waiting just around the corner! yes! miho and gail, along with the twins return."
2,This time art isn't enough.,"Dwight, from A Dame to Kill For, returns and death follows. Along with psychotic episodes, visions of dinosaurs, and a number of other events that are too silly to mention. This time the Miller art can't compensate for the story. This one is purely style over substance."
3,A Pedestrian Sin City Tale from Frank Miller,"Frank Miller has apparently discovered Quentin Tarantino. ""The Big Fat Kill"" echoes much of Tarantino's work in tone and gruesomeness, to its detriment.The story this time features the shaky truce between Old Town prostitutes and the Sin City police. When a cop is killed in Old Town, the protagonist takes great pains to cover up the death and protect the women from the repercussions. Mayhem ensues.When ""Sin City"" first appeared, it was a revelation. The use of negative space, the noir elements, the over-the-top scripting, all served to separate it from that which had come before. With ""The Big Fat Kill"", Miller's enthusiasm for the series seems to be on the wane. Essential for Sin City completists only."
4,great,"I've said it before and I know I'll continue to say it, when it comes to comic book artists, no one tops Frank Miller (and no, I haven't forgotten about Alan Moore). He comes in an works magic. I love the pen and ink artwork, both simple and complex. And Miller is great with noir. Sin City is everyone's favorite town of sin populated with everyone's favorite losers. You're gonna love it."
5,A violent joy.,"Frank Miller's Sin City is still the greatest series of graphic novels out there. Book 3 of 7, The Big Fat Kill is a tale about Dwight McCarthy and how he tries to save the girls of Old Town from war with the mob and the police. Featuring stylized bloody violence, and Miller's gritty off-the-street dialogue, The Big Fat Kill is a great book and should be read again and again. Be sure to check out the movie. I hope you enjoy this awesome graphic novel!"
4,Big Fat Surprise,"Frank Miller is at it again. The man who made the public take comics seriously with ""The Dark Knight Returns"" is now at work with the Sin City series, making his name as the Quentin Tarantino of the comic book. His work sizzles like a hot California night and there are times when you can smell the gunpowder on his pages. For this particular entry, a nasty customer winds up starting more trouble in Sin City then he's prepared to handle. It's only after the poor lug gets what he has coming to him that the clean up begins, and Miller's protagonist, tough guy Dwight, has to help the girls protect the City they call their own.While not quite as stirring as the Batman or Daredevil works, this Sin City series is Miller to the max, and that makes it worth the read."
4,Fall in love with Miho all over again,"This is another great book in the Sin City series. Since much has already been said about this book I'll be brief.This is another great work of Frank Miller. His unique art and story-telling ability never seem to disappoint me. There are many reasons why this is one of my favorites. The main reason is because of Miho.Every time she is on a page I am in a state of giddly bliss. She is a both interesting and beautiful character.Lastly, if anything, this book should be picked up just to admire how much heart, care, and authenticity was put into the motion picture by Rodriguez and Miller."
2,A watered down rewrite of what WAS a fantastic read.,Why Nixon was compelled to destroy the meaning and content of the original Joe Karbo text is a mystery. The concise power of the original text truly changed my life. I bought this copy to share with someone (Amazon refuses to do searches for used copies of the original). It was a big disappointment. Buy Think and Grow Rich by Napolean Hill instead. You won't be sorry.
1,don't do it,this is the 3rd aiwa system i've had a problem with. i've never know anyone that has had luck with anything in this brand. the cd reader stops working on every one i have ever owned. save yourself the money and go for another brand!
1,FUI ENGANADO,"bought this perfume and I have the impression that it is fake, therefore, does not have a lot of fixing. moreover, in his bottle, the brand came azarro shaved. a shame."
1,One of the worst songs ever,this is the third single from the album 'get rich or die tryin' it has no rhythm to it and sounds nothing like 50's previous track.
3,Handbook of Attachment,When I ordered this book I thought there was a later version available. Online there are two versions available - this one (1999) and a later one - 2002 or 2003 or even later - I can't remember. It was confusing if the later one was available or if there is even a later one. When I submitted this question to Amazon they basically said that there was no way of determining which book would be sent to me. So it was disappointing when I received the earlier version. I wasn't about to take the time to send it back because I needed to start using it.
4,made of glass,"I saw the one star rating and just had to say something. This decanter is no more fragile than any other GLASS decanter. Yes, it will break if you strike it against the sink while washing it out. Of course most people are not clumsy, they are simply too fast. Speed breaks glass most of the time. Slow down, and your decanter will last much longer. I just broke mine, first time in 6 years. Yep, I struck a glass because I didn't have my contacts in yet. Should have waited but I was in a hurry. Murphy's Law is always waiting for anyone in a hurry."
4,Bunn coffee pot,I broke my Bunn coffee pot. So I replaced it by ordering from Amazon.com. They were fast in delivery. Very pleased.
4,Decanter,"It's a basic decanter, my only problem is the lid is kind of loose and when you go to pour the coffee into the cup, it spills onto the counter."
5,As good as the original!,I cracked our original one and was pleasantly surprised to find a replacement on amazon for a great price. This is made by Bunn and works perfectly!
3,Just o.k.,"The product received was clearly labled as ""Bunn"" as indicated. However, I believe it to be a ""second"" or ""imperfect"" item because although it fit the coffee maker, the lid did not fit anywhere near as tight as the original one. This is no great shakes, but it should be notated. Delivery took two weeks from order date. That is unacceptable."
5,Back to new,I love my Bunn coffee maker. When I broke the Carafe I thought I would be out of luck as I could not find one in a store that would fit... soo thankful to find this replacement carafe. Now we are as good as new...Thanks for the quick shipping and fair price.
5,Bunn Replacement Carafe,"I was very pleased to find a replacement carafe for my parents. I was able to search and find it quickly, order it and have it sent to them. It arrived promptly and in great condition!"
2,Breaks Easy,I have replaced the decanter twice in the last year. It is definitely fragile as just slight bump will create a crack. I have had Cusinart coffee maker for five years and the decanter never broke. At the rate of replacement I can buy myself a new coffee machine.
5,Have a Cup of Coffee,"This is my third decanter. I have a problem with hitting them against something hard. The first one came with the Bunn coffee maker. The second was a ""fits all"" and now the correct decanter. I wish they were made of metal for the klutzy people like me."
5,Best Coffee Maker!,If you are looking for the fastest and best coffee maker - you have found it! A full pot of Coffee is made in 3 minutes and it is brewed at the right hot temperature where all of the flavor of the coffee is captured! I have had a Bunn manufactued Coffee Maker for 10 years where I can attest for the quality of their machines.
5,Amazing,"Amazing, incredible, fun music. Makes me laugh and happy. Sci-fi, fantasy, folk, blues, throat singing. Could this be fantasy folk blues? I recommend this band for everyone."
3,Cool stuff,"Interesting mix if you're into covers, remixes, and electronic distortion...Felix Da Housecat represents, as do some other familiar names. My only gripe is that it's too short."
2,too small to fit a 2 year old!,"I ordered both this silver set and the one in black that look identical except for the colors. This silver set is smaller in the breastplate and the helmet. So much so that my two-year old can't fit it on his body (and definitely doesn't fit my four-year old whom I purchased it for). There isn't any good place to attach the sheath for the sword on either set. Otherwise, my boys do enjoy fighting with just the sword and the shield. I probably would buy it again just for those two pieces."
4,Great use of imagination!,"My son received this for his 3rd birthday. He loves pretending to be the ""hero"" soldier and ""saving"" mommy from the dragons. He is in the 100th percentile, so he is big for his age. The helmet, therefore, is almost too small for him (squeezes his cheeks) but he still loves to wear it and loves having sword fights with his daddy. It's a hit too when older boys come over to play so apparently it works well for 3 year olds to 6 year olds. My 22month old son also enjoys wearing the helmet! It's fun to see their imagination at work!"
3,kid loves it,This is a cheap costume that kids will love. Just dont expect to much for a $20 item. Helmet is small like others have stated
4,Helmet was ridiculously small!,"Everything in this set was nice and worked well for my three year old's costume except the helmet. It was so small, there is no way it would fit on any toddler/child's head. Luckily we already had a knight's helmet so it didn't affect us, but I would have been very disappointed if that had not been the case."
4,Dollar tree items.,I just bought for my son this kit... Dollar store sells each part separately... except shield... but sure worth it... :) $1 each item. Comes in 2 colors.Maybe this kit has better quality... but I am app with one I bought.
4,Great Photo Opp,"This toy is really cute. The mask, shield, and chest armor are durable but the sword wasn't unwrapped long before it was bent. I would buy it again, though."
1,"Great idea, but not made well for kids!","This is a fabulous idea and my son loved it.....except.....the sword material is flimsy and within a month it had bent from repeated stabbings (lol). Now it is permanently creased and difficult to play with. The helmet doesn't have a chin strap and won't stay on during play. The vest attachements are not kid friendly and so my 4 year old can't put it on himself and it has sharp corners that poke in to him when he moves. Great idea, poor execution. If you want a fun knight costume, I would look for a different brand."
2,"Have This Crock Pot, not that GREAT","I bought this crock pot new and have only used it 4 to 5 times. I will buy a new one as this one is not that great.Pros:Cooks very fast, easy to useCons:burns the food, lid does not stay on tight so all the liquid squirts all over the counter, the lid dances on top of the pot, hard to clean, and the worst part is the metal gets extremely hot. I have been burned bad a few times. If you have elderly or children do not get this one.Sharon"
1,"Never ever, EVER, EVER buy!","This movie is so bad i can't express myself enough. I like Snoop and that is the ONLY good thing about this film, i wouldn't even go as far as to call it a film.Even if your a snoop fan you WILL hate this movie,anyone who says it is good is just in denial because they wasted money buying it.Usually i couldn't be bothered writing a review on a film but since this film was so bad I just had to add my 2 cents. (...) After the first 2 minutes it was so bad i nearly turned it off there and then.Bad actors,bad plot,bad quality.I seriously DO NOT recommend!"
4,I'm Good With It,"After spending money to build a surround system good enough for music, and not just for movies, I found that I still prefer stereo for music. So, sorry, but I can't comment on the delay issue, all my listening is/was in stereo.This is a DVD-A. That means that, in effect, it's a high definition CD, except that you need a DVD player to listen to it. It will NOT play on a standard CD player.I'd recommend this collection of songs to old time, hard core fans, like myself. It's alternative versions of some of their earlier work. If you're just discovering UH, start with regular studio albums or 'best of' type recordings. Especially since this is out of print, rare, and expensive.The sound is clean enough, but sometimes the songs don't sound completely finished, ie: vocals too forward, one channel louder than the other, etc.However, I'm a fan, the songs are great, and the differences from album versions run from interesting to 'Wow, cool'.joe"
2,Gold from the Byron Era?,"I was really excited when this was released being a fan of their early material and a surround nut.After a listen I was really disappointed.All the early material I love from Salisbury and a few other early albums all have the same problem of the left rear surround channel being a few milliseconds ahead of the other channels.Every disc I have heard has this problem and the bands web site and record label would not return a response when questioned about it.Could have been a great album, but is really not enjoyable to listen too."
3,Its an ok piece for the price,The shipping is outrageous for this little piece. The detail is only one one side which is kinda lame.
4,"For sheer musical energy, this trio triumphs","Everysunday's Scheme A Dream is that rare independent record that sounds like a million bucks...on sheer musical talent alone. From the masterful acoustic blues/folk/jazz guitar stylings of singer/songwriter Keith Tasker to the rhythmically precise team of Scott Lambert and George Gervais on drums and bass, this trio is an exciting discovery. With the addition of some well-placed horns and piano,they create a sound that is uniquely their own, while bringing to mind Blood, Sweat and Tears and The Dave Matthews Band. My favorite songs are: ""Scheme A Dream,"" ""The Label"" and ""Don't Hang Up."" A feast for the ears!"
5,I Love Mads!,"Any movie with Mads Mikkelsen is great. This film was hard to watch at times, because it dealt with the breaking apart of a family. The acting was excellent, and the story itself was well written. It was a great film!"
1,Useless piece of trash,"This mouse is designed horribly bad !! It opens fine when it is new, but as soon as you put in the batteries, it refuses to open. I suspect that the designers of this mouse did not think about trying to open it when the batteries are in .. I would not recommend it to anyone, unless you want a use and throw mouse.I thought Kensington was a good company. Did not expect this from them. I will stay away from their products henceforth."
1,Unfortunate design,"I have the same criticisms as many others. I had to put on rubber gloves to open the battery compartment. After turning it off after the first use, I couldn't get it turned back on again and returned it to the store. I loved the size, but I bought a nice wireless by Microsoft; not a mini, but easy to use, a battery compartment that opens without difficulty, and a nifty little snap-in receiver that turns the mouse off automatically. Take it out, put it in the usb port and the mouse is back on again. Price was comparable, even though I pay a lot more for these items, living in the Caribbean. Amazon does not ship anything but books, cd's and dvd's to the Caribbean."
1,Don't bother.,"Afer 3 months the transmitting unit died! Other cons: 1. it requires new batteries every 2 or 3 weeks, 2. not ergonomic, 3. the cover difficult to open to change the batteries. I guess you get what you paid for!"
1,Don't buy it even if it is for free,I was so excited when I first saw the mouse. Because it was wireless optical and size I liked it. Its performance sucks. I used for 1 week and the range is not event 2 feet.... I first thought the piece is defective. I went to compusa and they gave me a brand new piece. Then I decided to test the new piece in their stores only. The notebook had USB slot (same as mine) on left side and the mouse works when I kept it on left side of laptop. When I kept it on right... IT DOESN'T Work... What the use then !!! I returned it immediately.
3,great mouse with some drawbacks...,"I paid $30 at Staples because I had to use up some credits.Most of my comments have been stated... to set up push the battery cover down as indicated and install the batteries in the correct direction. You will see a red light on bottom if installed correctly. Then plug in the receiver, hold the button on the receiver for about 5 secs, and then using a pen or paper clip press in the button on the bottom of the mouse for about 5 secs. You should see a steady light now on the receiver and your good to go.Minor gripe - battery cover removal feels like you can break itMajor gripe - on/off requires use of a paper clip or pen and the pressing of 2 buttons - not practical, so I'll always leave on which will eat up my batteries."
1,Impossibly Difficult,It is next to impossible to open this item just to insert the batteries!That is THE most absurd thing I've seen. What kind of ridiculous engineering is that? Must have been the same guy who designed the Spasmotica sneaker!That engineer who designed this needs to be deported.Extremely infuriating.
1,don't buy this,"It is a huge pain to replace the batteries-- the best way I have figured out is to use a butter knife and twist it between the button and the battery lid-- very frustrating any other way. Also, it doesn't connect to the USB very well- mine is very wobbly. I would not recommend this mouse."
2,Looks nice....,"This mouse looks great sitting on my desk, broken. The mouse worked flawlessly for a few months, then I started to have problems with it. It would lose connectivity after a certain amount of time, and unfortunately it got shorter and shorter. Now the mouse is pretty much useless. I might have gotten a defective model, I am not sure, but I would not reccomend this mouse. I also have visited their website for software updates but after installing them, they did not help."
1,kensington wireless optical mini mouse,I have replaced the batteries frequently and still have problems with the mouse turning off and on..
2,Not so good...,"I bought this item from Best Buy. It works great until it was time to change the batteries. The battery cover is hard to open, which caused a back piece to break off. Since then, the mouse did not work anymore. I would not recommend this mouse."
1,NO support from Kensington,"I have misplaced the manual, and there is NO manual online anywhere for this mouse. It worked well but now I cannot get it linked with it's USB pod. JUNK."
5,kensington pocketmouse wireless mini,"This mouse is wonderful, particularly for those, like me, who have smaller hands. Easy to use and my new one now has a button on the bottom that you can turn off to save battery life. My first Kensington wireless mini mouse lasted 5-6 years."
1,Tough to put batteries in the mouse!,Kensington products work great for the most part. But this item is so frustratingly difficult because of the lack of ease of opening the case to place or replace the batteries. You almost have to break the case to access the compartment. This is a major disappointment!
1,Poor design Mouse,"Purchased this unit as I needed one for travel. The unit was very difficult to install baterries, case would not open, had to be pried open. After installing original batteries packed with unit found it would not work. Cahnged and put in a new set - still would not work. Sent it back to Amaazon."
1,Used once until the batteries died,"The battery compartment is nearly impossible to open without breaking the latch that holds it in place. After great difficulty, I was able to open the battery case exactly once and load my first set of batteries. Some stroke of luck prevented the tiny plastic tab from breaking this first time. After the batteries eventually died and had to be replaced, I wasn't as lucky with the cover. Inspecting the broken pieces revealed a number of basic latch design flaws. It seems the designers of this product failed to take Snap-Fit Design 101. Engineering design review anyone?"
5,Excellent for Beginners,"This is an excellent book for the beginner in book binding, but don't expect boring flat books in spite of that. Richards presents numerous clever techniques including the faux fruit recipe book shown on the cover. You'll be making beautiful and interesting pieces in a single afternoon!"
3,Odd Books & Journals,"Richard's book contains numerous photos, easy, concise instructions, and several book types to make. The instructions are easy to read and understand and few should have any trouble completing the projects.The techniques all are geared towards each of the specific types of books to make. This is definitely not for the beginner who wants useful books.The biggest minus with this book is the types of books being created. Many of them are smaller in size. Few have real value for the journal or book maker. While the recipe book made from faux fruit on the cover is interesting it has no real practical value. Where do you store a pear shaped book??Definitely geared towards the ""art"" bookmaker."
2,Vague and Unhelpful,"In the spirit of full disclosure, I have to say I have some experience with bookbinding and was probably expecting more from this book than I should have. Apart from that, though, I still think this book is not really worth buying if you're interested in beginning bookbinding. Not only are the instructions vague and unhelpful, some of the instructions go against everything else I've learned about bookbinding. An experienced bookbinder might be able to interpret the directions for some of these projects, but only because of previous practice instead of clear instruction and helpful photos and diagrams. I would recommend Handmade Books, by Shereen LaPlantz, Making Handmade Books, by Alisa Golden, anything by Keith Smith, or internet tutorials instead of this book.The only reason I gave this book two stars instead of one is that there are some fun ideas that could inspire a bookmaker."
5,Wonderful ideas to help scrapbookers!,"I'm a scrapbook enthusiast. The colorful photos in this book caught my eye immediately. It is filled with detailed instructions and ideas to create journals and scrapbooks or embellish existing ones. I love it! I must say, though, many of these projects are fairly detailed, and require some patience. But they are so worth it! And the projects make terrific gifts!"
1,2 failure in less than monh after purchase,"Hi I bought my Toshiba laptop in October 2002. After only 15 days my HDD was dead. Toshiba fixed it for 10 days. Few weeks later my CD burner died. I burned only few CD before it happend.This time I was waiting 2 weeks. So in less then 2 months, my Toshiba died twice, and I spent 4 weeks instead of enyoing my new computer, waiting home and with new ulcer on my stomach.Now is working good, but I do not know for how long."
2,"Too Expensive, there are better deals at Amazn","The battery life on this machine is disgusting. 1.67 hours? That is half the average life span of just about any other machine. However, by looking at the stats it is easy to see where all the power is going. The 1.7 GHz P4 processor is far from average. It also has only 32megs video card.Laptop gets very hot! And after a while it freezes sometimes.I made immediately exchange for Sony, which I am very happy now!No stability problems and no heat issues!Sony VAIO FXA53 Notebook (1.3 GHz Athlon XP1500) makes better deal, also battery life with Sony is up to 3hours.I recomad Sony VAIO FXA53 Notbeook from Amazon!! 5 stars!"
4,Great machine for what I expected,"Many thanks to all who took the time to review this machine before me. They helped me make an informed purchase.In brief: The speed is great. The UXGA screen is great! Battery life is lousy, but I knew that going in and don't need more than an hour at a time. I don't notice or mind the fan, comes on intermittently for a few seconds once in awhile.It's a big change in many ways from the ultra-tiny Sharp Actius it's replacing, (faster, better screen, fast big drive, heavier), but a good value.I haven't dealt with Toshiba tech support, and I hope I don't have to. Their web site seems very good for drivers and updates, and pretty bad for actual support, or discussion, or knowlege base type searching.I'm happy with it after 4 weeks."
2,Not so happy!,"Compaq makes better Notebooks, also Compaq Presario 725US Notebook (Athlon-4 1600+) is faster and cheaper right now. I recommend Compaq Notebook for extreme performance. I have been running Compaq for 2 weeks now, and did not find anything wrong with Compaq Athlon-4.You will not be disappointed!Thank you Amazon for great product and fast delivery!"
4,Great game with a high fun factor,This game is really fun to play. It's pretty quick.. took about 5 hours to beat. I just got a Xbox360 and I actually put that down to play the 'old school' psx dino crisis games for a few weeks. Dino crisis 2 is much better than the original (though the original is fun too).. the weapon layout and game play is wayyy better in the second one. There are way more dinos to take out and more area to explore. The graphic are slightly better and the menus are laid out better. Game play is just as fun as newer games imho. If you havent played these yet.. just imagine resident evil 2 with dinos instead of zombies. Only thing that kinda sucked was I did get enough 'dino points' to buy the best weapons & supplies till the very end. When you start a new game there was no option to keep them.. maybe I just didnt save enough. Oh well.. def pick this game up!!
4,Game of the millinium,"I have not yet played dino crisis but DINO CRISIS 2 is the best game I have ever played.DINO CRISIS 2 is just non stopADVENTURE and ACTION.There are many species of dinosaurs .There are big dinosaurs like T-REX,Allosaurs,giagantosaurs.There are many places to visit like Military Facility,Reserchfacility,Eden City etc.It is not that all scary. There area lot of WEAPONS to choose from.You even control 2 characters(Dylin and Regina).Raptors are everywhere.THERE are evensea and the flying repliles.The only defect with the game is thatit is not scary and there are not enough BIG Dinosaurs. DINO CRISIS2 IS AN ESSENTIAL BUY."
3,where's the storyline ?,"This game is high on violence and low on story line especially when you compare it to DC1. If you like mindless bang, bang shot em up games then this is for you. The killing for points was too much and finding the weapons probably would have been better, being it's hard to determine what you really need and what is just waste. There wasn't a bond with any of the characters and I can't believe that Regina who was so pro team on DC1 would just walk away from someone she is on a mission with. The character David was a waste and probably got 5 minutes of screen time. On the up side the mini games where unique and the graphics got better toward the end.It's not a bad game but I don't think I would play it again."
2,What has Capcom done???,"I wasnt really too sure about buying this game, but I thought since all Capcom games are golden, this would be too. . .I was wrong. This is NOTHING like the first one. For instance: There arent any scary moments that have you changing your underwear. And there's WAY to much ammo and guns that you can buy thanks to those stupid ""points"" after killing dinos. There's really no challenge in this game. POINTLESS compared to Resident Evil where you have to save every bullet to kill the zombies. In this game you just run around shooting dinos that always re-apear seconds after there dead. The voice acting is decent, and there's plenty of scencs that keep the story moving, even if the story doesnt make too much sence. The CG movies are awesome, especially the intro. But thats about it. Not the best Capcom has done."
3,"Okay, if all you want is no-brain action","Dino Crisis 2. Finally sat down to play this, and it's okay - it keeps the pace up, the dinos are mean and hungry, the graphics are as good as the PS1 gets, what more could you want? Well, a challenge, and a plot that doesn't fall apart would be nice. This ain't survival horror, because there's no survival, and no horror. The extinction point system takes all the intelligence out of the game - just run around shooting stuff and you can have the biggest gun going. The story just gets sillier by the minute, like the writers kept getting bored, and there isn't even an end, it just stops.To be fair its a great arcade game, it looks really good and Regina is one hot tamale. It takes a lot of skill if you play for maximum points and the extra game sequences (like the crosshair games) vary the formula, but its no classic, and the jump to Xbox just proves that the Japanese home market could care less about any sequels. Sorry, but there it is."
3,Dino crisis 2,"IF you played and liked the first one, get this one also. its still a fun game for the playstation and is much improved in this title. The game arrived as described and was on time. I had no problem with the CD at all, and it was ordered used."
4,Dino Crisis 2,"First of all i want to say that you should not buy this game because it only took me about 6 hours to beat. Rent it instead. also, this is not a game that will scare you like the first dino crisis. but thats only because you now there is going to be a dinosaure near buy. Now that the bad stuff is out of the way, let me tell you how good it is. The game play is fast with very little slow downs. the graphice are great and the sound goes really well with the game. yes it is incredibly easy but it is extremly fun. after a while you start to want the rapters to come at you so you can shoot them to kingdom come. you cant deny the exileration you get from charging a dinosaure with a shotgun. The only reason the game doesnt get a perfist score is because of the lack of special features that would want to make you play through the game more then once."
2,60-pieces puzzle for 2-and-half-year-old boy,"We bought this 60-piece puzzle for our son, who was 2 year 4 months old at that time. (His 35-piece airport puzzle was too easy for him.)Our son really loved this 60-piece puzzle, and put together almost 10 times during his first day - You can see his excitement. He needed some help during first couple of times of play in the first day. Within 2 days, he was able put together this puzzle in 5-10 minutes by himself everytime. His doctor told us that my son's puzzle ability is much ahead of his age group. We are glad to make this choice that my son loves.In fact, we now have ordered a 100-piece Thomas train puzzle since he just turned 2-year-6-month old and this 60-piece puzzle seems too easy for him already.We believe that puzzles help to develop a child's mental ability substantially, especially in areas of object recognition, spatial positioning, divide-and-conquer subassembly, short-term memory, and to some extent, finger movement skills."
4,Fond Memories,"I read this book many years ago, and decided to delve into it again.It is an enjoyable read and fast paced, as most of the Xanth books are. When Ivy, the tiny princess befriends the most formidable dragon in the land, after things get a little wacky with a misplaced splash of youth elixir, you know only interesting things can happen from that point forth.The Xanth books are fun because they are like Saturday morning cartoons...pure enjoyment with no pressure to come away with deep meaning, heavy philosophical conclusions, or reflective insights. They are there, if one wishes to look for them, but I don;t think that Piers Anthony ever meant for this series to be that way. I think they are meant o be just what they are. Fun to read."
5,GRRRREAT!!!!,Piers Anthony caught my attention a long time ago with Crewel Lye and I have loved it ever since. This book like all the others is essential to the history of Xanth and manages to be humorous while telling a great story.
2,Disappointing Effort from a Worthwhile Author,"I have truly enjoyed all of Anthony's Xanth books up until this one. The books of this series are made memorable and entertaining to me largely due to the incredible imagination of the author. That is, unfortunately, the main missing aspect of this novel. Our young heroine's talent seems to function as a vehicle for making unbelievable polt twists occur rather than as a specific talent that marked the heros and heroines of the other Xanth novels. **SPOILER** Another weak chain of events was the benefit reaped by the Tree of Life. That idea was about as poorly put forth as Ivy's talent of convenience---I was half expecting Irene to find a seed that grew cannons or Volvos.While most other Xanth novels had the ability to make the reader believe that the fantastical events were possible in Xanth due to the incredible magic of the land and characters, this one just made this reader believe the author ran out of good ideas."
3,ACDelco 15-81087 blower motor resistor,Put this part in to 2004 GMC Sierra 1500. The wire harness and clip slipped into place with ease. The holes for the screws to mount it to the AC system did not line up at all. There is a cage over the OEM part that was in the vehicle and that did not fit over this part. Had to put an original screw in place and use a self tapping screw in other side to mount and seal it in place. It made the blower motor work properly and shipping was faster than stated.ACDelco 15-81087 Blower Motor Resistor
5,Excellent product,Product was a perfect fit. Parts visible were heavy duty and well assembled. Works great. I should check Amazon more often for special parts.
4,Collection is mixed but last story is hauntingly beautiful,"Another varied collection fron UlK. Some of the stories are wistful, some silly and indulgent. The strength lies in the cluster of stories around the invention of instantaneous space travel - which is itself an extension of the ansible invented by Shevek in'The Dispossessed'. The last (and title) story is the very best of these and is as good as anything she has ever written. As ever with UlK, she has very little interest in the natural science, though she quickly paints a backdrop which is completely convincing. Instead, she is interested in the human effects. The story is about loss and regret and finding ones way, deciding what to do with one's life and having an opportunity to have part of one's life again. If you are tired of mile long star ships and ravening beams of death then this is the sort of story that you have been waiting for. And you will always remember it."
4,Again and again,I finally bought this book after I checked it out from the library about once a month just to read the last story again. It is my favorite story of all time. The one story is worth the money. The others are OK and a few are fun. I would like to have just the last story in a smaller version.
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A rather weak collection, this one, barely averaging over 3 per story. Nothing of any particular note.Fisherman of the Inland Sea : The First Contact With the Gorgonids - Ursula K. LeGuinFisherman of the Inland Sea : Newton's Sleep - Ursula K.

1,Save your money and play poker for real,"I was looking forward to this game but was I ever dissapointed. I thought these poker games could only get better, was I wrong. The graphics are horrible and the gameplay is extremly slow and there is no way to speed it up. Save your money and use it to play poker for real, you will have much more fun."
2,subskate,"I gave the board to my grandson, 13, who is also a very good snowboarder and skateboarder along with being an excellent swimmer and he could not figure out how the board is supposed to work in the water. Eventually the children used it as a float board to float in the pool."
2,Glorified Float Toy,"Don't waste your money. The advertising for this item makes it look like you can ""skateboard"" in the pool. It is basically a balance board that does not allow any ""skating"" at all. Every child who has used it in my pool becomes bored with it within a few minutes. When balancing on the board, it can launch out of the water and have had a few people get a fairly good smack in the face. Have also had older children (7-13) try jumping on it from the side of the pool due to the ad that makes it appear a boy is moving through the water. Very dangerous if they fall backwards. They held up well but my grandkids use them as float toys only. I'm glad I didn't pay full price for them."
5,"Might not be a skateboard, but it is fun and durable","I have had the blue subskate for about 5 years now. While the other reviewers are correct in saying that you can't really skate on it underwater as the photos show, you CAN balance on it underwater and that is very challenging. The subskate makes a nice floatation piece to sit on and float with, and the best part is that it is DURABLE. Here in Arizona, you're lucky if pool toys last 1 summer with the chlorine, sun, and heat, and this floatation toy looks brand new after 5 years - which is very impressive. If you want a long lasting noodle or pool floatation toy, your money will be well-spent on the subskate."
1,do not pay for this toy,I got this toy on clearence at target for 4 Dollars. I would be very upset if I would have payed 1 cent more. All you do with this toy is balance on it nothing more. No skating involved. Very misadvertised!
2,use of product,There are no directions. I don't understand how this product is used. My grandchildren were confused. I suppose it is a waste of money.
5,fun pool toy and great exercise,This is such a fun way to excercise in the pool. Highly recommended. You will have a blast using this thing!
5,Very happy with these shoes!,"I already own a pair of these shooes and like them, so I bought an extra pair and I'm really happy and they arrived fast;)."
5,Perfect shoe find.,"My son needed a pair of white tennis shoes for his casual choir outfit. After looking in every store around and online I was so happy to find these. I hated the idea of spending money on a pair of ugly solid white shoes that he wouldn't wear outside of choir and these are perfect. They are exactly what we were looking for and they are so good looking. He's completely happy with them, they fit well and they don't look like shoes his grandpa would wear. Love K-Swiss!"
1,dissapointing.,Love KSwiss but this product proved to be a big dissapointment. Glue showing all over the sneaker and when you walk in them there is a horrible squeaking noise. Kept the sneakers thinking once they were broken in it would be better but unfortunately it was not.
3,It's ok,"Bought these for a white school uniform shoe. It is narrow at the ball of the foot, completely straight where your foot would be widest. Might want to consider a wide width or one size larger, even if you don't normally need wide. Seems to hold up well to wear. Leather in good condition."
4,USB . . . . but still a bit slow,"I recently bought the HP Jornada 545, and use the USB cradle to synchronize all of my information and to transfer files. It's usually pretty fast, and I love the fact that it synchronizes everything automatically. But, while transfering mp3s and other larger files, it seemed to be a little slow. All in all, however, its a good device that has many positive points."
3,Life of Venerable Mary of Agreda,"I am glad that I bought the item because it is a bit of a collector's item now. When it was written there were no biographies in English of Venerable Mary of Agreda so this was a great effort.Mary of Agreda had an extremely interesting life even though she never ventured out of her native village, and for many years had never left her convent. She still managed to convert the Jumano tribe in Arizona and had some of the most interesting and prolific mystical experiences in recorded history. I recommend City of God by Mary of Agreda, but would recommend a meatier biography to study her life. In the author's defense it must be said that there was much less information available in English when this was written than is the case today.All in all it is an enjoyable read, but I think some later books might be more informative."
1,Buy some sponges while you are at it ...,"I've never been motivated to write a product review before, but I have never hated a product as much before. There is absolutely no way to get this coffee pot to make coffee without having a mess to clean up. You can't pour the water into the maker without it spilling (the lift-up hatch doesn't leave enough space for the carafe), and the carafe itself is a carefully engineered dribble pot, only the very slowest of pours will result in a dry countertop. Now I just grab a sponge before I pour a cup. I'll be buying another brand soon."
1,"Bad Coffee, Bad Machine!",This Machine worked for only 4 months before it leaked all the water. Even when it was working the coffee always tasted like plastic. Don't waste your money and choose something else.
3,Recall info in review incorrect...,"The recall applies to the TCM800 and the TCM850, not this coffeemaker."
1,Try something else,"This is my second Black and Decker thermal carafe coffee pot and this one is no better than the last one - that was recalled! Getting the water into the back is messy but the worst part is letting the ""untrained"" pour their own coffee. You may finally learn how to use the lid but believe me your guests won't. I bought this because I thought it would keep coffee fresher for entertaining. All it does is cause a headache. People either leave the ""lock button"" open and the coffee gets cold or they unlock the lid and then when they try to pour coffee, the lid goes flying and coffee comes pouring out - all over the counter, cabinets, in the drawers, on the floor, etc. If you don't want to have to train your guests, get something MUCH EASIER to use."

4,Three By The Sea,"This was a wonderful book to read with my son. He knew most of the word and found the story line extremely funny. Myself, I thought is was cute."
4,Stands the test of time.,"The publication date says 1994, but I first read this and the other books with Sam, Lolly, and Spider (Three Up A Tree, Four By The Shore) in the early 80's. I still love to read them to little kids, and kids do love them from preschool until they are able to read them to other kids and beyond. Parents will appreciate the slightly off-color nature of the Marshalls' writing."
4,"Bloody Marvelous, mostly!","Spawn, is a game that is alot of fun if you realyy get into it. Though sometimes it get difficult with the frequent death rate, in the end you still love the havoc you can reek with a missile launcher or magical chains. The graphics are crisp and the camera is pretty decent. The framerate is a solid 60 fps and the weapons are plentiful and amusing. If your a fighting game fan and you want take a break from massive combo capcom fighters, pick this title up. If your looking for fighting depth, look elsewhere. This is maniac fighters only. At least a rental, for everyone else."
5,Addict,"I sold my Dreamcast a while back, a long while back and now regret it. I cant stop wanting to play this game. Dang i wish i could play it on my Xbox. The controller is prefect for the game. I still remember the filling and the squills of my Friends as i jump down behind them as Dark ages spawn. They new they where dead. or when my cousen missed a shot with twitch and found a tremer fist in his face. OH YES I REMEMBER i guess i will have to buy a dream cast agian just for the game."
3,A wolf's hair short,"Not my favorite of the three books to be honest. Granted it does give a great bit of Maniel's background, as per his transformation from wolf to man...but it didn't really give a clear explaination as to how...or really why. You understand the underlining causes, but it still seems very vague, as if the author skimmed over it and hoped we wouldn't notice."
4,Not too bad,"Night of the Wolf wasn't too bad. The first part of the book kind of turned me off but eventually it got better. The steamy scenes were unnecessary and ruined a good fantasy, but other than that it was pretty good. It was disappointing not continuing with Regeane from The Silver Wolf, and jumping backwards in time, but I suppose it turned out more interesting than The Silver Wolf. The King Wolf jumps back again to Regeane, and though I have not read it yet, I will eventually, but I'm in no hurry right now; it wasn't one of those books that totally grabbed me. I suggest reading Anne Bishop's Black Jewels Trilogy, it's much more addictive than Alice Borchardt.ShatteredCrystalChalice"
2,Gave up after 150 pages,"I hardly ever put down a book prematurely once I start it, but I found I had no interest in the characters, therefore I didn't care what happened to them. So I quit. Seems to me like there should be some evidence of a plot by where I was in the book, but unless it was a love story (gag), I couldn't discern it. The only reason I bought this book was the relation to A.Rice. Big mistake. Too bad too, because the first 75 pages or so started off great. She can definitely write well, she just needs more of a story to build on. Like what kind of creature is this wolf? No clues were given."
2,Couldn't Finish It,"I enjoyed The Silver Wolf, but Night of the Wolf just didn't go anywhere. The story surrounding the wolf character was boring and the stories about the other characters were confusing. Perhaps those who persevered into the second half were rewarded. I couldn't get there.I'm glad it was a library book. I won't be trying Ms. Borchardt again."
2,Disappointing prequel to Silver Wolf,"This book is more of a historical novel filled with erotica than a fantasy novel, even though one of the characters can turn into a wolf. Her previous book, ""Silver Wolf"", seemed more story-driven, while this one just seemed long. I trudged through the whole thing, thinking I would at least learn more about the wolf, but ended up disappointed."
3,Decent prequel to Silver Wolf/Wolf King,"I have to say though that I was NOT happy with how this begun. Silver Wolf started off in a mysterious but coherent way - all the essential knowledge was revealed quickly enough, but for this one, the beginning was just confusing. The tale of Maeniel itself is interesting, as it shows how he became what he is and his learning how to be human, but compared to TSW, this book was lacking. Some of the characters were interesting, but the story itself felt rather disjointed, with various characters popping up and then dying or the like. There were a lot of questions left unanswered (and more questions raised that were then left unanswered!). If you liked the Silver Wolf, you might like this, just don't expect the same amount of quality that was in TSW. And if you didn't read The Silver Wolf, then read it first because otherwise this story will feel even more disjointed than it already is."
1,"Three Strikes, You're Out","If you want to be confused for almost an entire story, just read this. Alice Borchardt did not keep to a very good story line in her book Silver Wolf but in Night of the Wolf I believe there never was a story line. She jumps from one thing to another without any conection what so evcr. This is probably the 3rd worst story I have ever read and I read about 30 books a year. Anyway, that was strike two. I will give her one more chance before I decide to never read another of her books. It's hard to believe she is related to Ann Rice."
3,I expected so much more,"I loved Silver Wolf, so I was expecting to love Night of the Wolf, but I was disappointed. There was far too much erotica, and to little story. (It flet like The Mamoth Hunters or Plains of Passage.) More happened in this book, but most of it I was not sure why it happened. I did fall in love with Maniel, but still she could have done so much more with the character. I enjoyed the book, just not as much as I had hopped to. Oh well, we'll just hafta read the next one and see if she improves."
3,"Not really a werewolf story, more like a erotica!!!","Even though I like this book, I have to say it's a bit disappointing compare to Alice's other book- The silver wolf. The story itself was quite interesting and I found it a good bed-time-reading book. However it was a bit lack of depth, kind of like TV soap, you read it, you enjoy most of it, but you don't give second thoughts to it.There were quite a few sex scenes in the book, I think it was a bit pointless. Sure it was to show parts of characters's personalities, but it was just a bit too much, especially when the same characters was involve again and again. There were a few parts made me wonder if the author got the history straight, also Dryas being refered as an Amazon was a bit stretching.The book was not related to ""The silver wolf"", and got even less story line about werewolf then The silver wolf, so I wouldn't recommened to readers who want a story similar to The silver wolf! However, it was a relax and enjoyable read for me."
2,If I hadn't bought it...,"...I would have quit after 50 pages or so. Ms. Borchardt successfully created a mysterious atmosphere by not explaining many of the characters' actions. There are many undercurrents and mystical events that are never explained. Perhaps if you are an expert on mythology, some of the mysteries will be apparent to you. I'm fairly well read, but much of the book went over my head. I won't buy another of her books."
5,Great Book,"I loved this story. The whole trilogy was fabulous. The way the author wove in the colorful, grandeur, and beautifully detailed history of Rome in the dark ages with the ancient folklore of shapeshifters was enchanting and mesmerizing. A complete story filled with full action, drama, suspense,(warning***some sexual content and obscene language), and of course a beautiful love story. Alice Borchardt's writing is captivating and prose-like at times, and yet, at others very true to the times and crass when appropriate. I felt like I was there witnessing the events in person. Borchardt took me to another people, place and time and I love it when a book can accomplish that. A very great read!"
4,Great bag,"I am very impressed with the quality of this bag. It just feels and carries solid.I keep finding new pockets and compartments that I didn't notice before which is both good and bad as I will most likely forget where I put stuff until I use it several times.This makes a great trauma/medical bag but I am still on the fence with it being suitable as a BOB/GHB. There aren't any large compartments that would easily fit normal BOB gear bigger then 5"". At some point I will transfer all my BOB gear over and see how it fits then update this post."
4,how about this on dvd,I KNOW THIS IS AN OLD MOVIE BUT TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST NOW A DAYS THE OLD STUFF IS BECOMING BETTER AND BETTER LOOKING WHEN YOU COMPARE IT WITH WHAT IS ON TODAY. I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THIS MOVIE ON DVD. HOW ABOUT IT?
3,Riders of the Purple Sage,"Just what my husband wanted. Wish I could have gotten it as a DVD. Excellent shape. Would recommend this VHS movie to anyone. Only wish it as a DVD. Played well. Thanks to the seller for getting it to me fast. Husband has seen and read about it and has also read the books. Would recommend this seller to anyonne seeking products. Had several to pick from,."
1,Didn't get,"I ordered my movie on 2/9/11, I was charged my credit card the very next day, and it is now 3/13/11 and I have not received my movie. The seller will not respond to my emails and Amazon has not refunded my order. I am more disgusted!!! They should have just came to my house and ""robbed"" me.....same difference. Will NEVER and I repeat NEVER purchase anything from Amazon again!"
3,"Book was terrific, movie a disappointment","Perhaps I should not have read the book first. The book was terrific: colorful characters, beautiful descriptive passages of the Utah country (as only Zane Grey can write), great story lines.The movie, while hitting on all the main points of the story, left out a lot of detail that made the book so wonderful, and helped to tie things together. I was really disappointed. The characters of Lassiter and Venters, although heroic in the movie, were much more colorful in the book, especially Venters. I won't go into any more details here (there are too many), but anyone who has seen this movie should read the book and judge for themselves. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is for the actors, Ed Harris and his wife Amy Madigan - I've always been fans of theirs (and they're the producers of this movie) - but they really should've taken the time and made this a little longer movie (it's only 90 minutes) in order to make it more true to the book."
1,"It had no power, and it broke!","I had this product for a year and just threw it away two days ago. I only used it for smoothies, but even that, it couldn't handle. It had no power, easily got stained (watermelon), took forever to crush ripe bananas, and it leaked; not to mention it occassionally refused to work for no reason. Three days ago I took it out for strawberry milk shake (fresh strawberries, not frozen ones), it wouldn't start. I tried several times, waited over night, and tried it again, it still didn't move. We finally decided to ditch it for good.It makes a perfect wedding gift if you really don't like the bride. She will get the idea when she uses it."
1,Blender has very little power,I bought this blender to make smoothies with and it is just awful. The motor gets hot and it doesn't seem to blend very well it gets stuck a lot.
3,I bought this for use with crafts,"For the price, it does an ok job. It's not very powerful though, and before I used it for craft items, I tried making some cranberry relish in it. It couldn't handle the frozen cranberries, so I had to stop and put everything back into my other blender.For light and easy use, and for my purposes it is fine though. I wouldn't recommend it to someone who needs to crush ice or do much heavy blending.It's made with plastic mostly, and I doubt it will last very long because of that. The blades are steel, but the turning mechanisms are not.Hope this is helpful for someone."
4,So Cool,"I was a bit worried about how the quality of this reprint was going to be. So many of these vintage posters have the creases in the reprints, but I was pleasantly surprised. The colors are vibrant and a nary a crease. Quite a value for such a cool print. Thanks."
3,nice quality,This is great quality but very difficult to install. The directions are not quite right and dont try to take it down because thats even worse. I would have it professionally installed.
1,Do not buy if you are not a handy man,My husband and I are in our 20's and and we just bought our first home. We are really just figuring out how to do home maintenance without calling my dad everyday. If you are like us do NOT buy this! It was terrible to mount and complete. I wish someone had told us this before we bought it.. there are many more by calphalone that look just as nice that seem to be easier to install. Good Luck!
5,16 years and still wonderful,"I installed this pot rack in 1996. I'm not super handy, but I was able to install it to studs in the wall without much difficulty. I have enjoyed using it for all of these years and I do not have any plans to replace it."
1,Cute but recharger squeals,"The idea is great - cute little rechargeable bedside lights. The lights themselves are good-looking. However, there's a major problem with the design - the induction charging base emits a high-pitched squeal when the lights aren't on it (to me it's akin to fingernails-on-chalkboard). I called Vessel and they confirmed that all of their two-light charging bases squeal but ""not everybody can hear that high"". Kids usually have better high-frequency hearing than adults, and since they're the target users for the lights this design flaw is completely unacceptable."
5,"fun, useful and safe","my daughters have had these for a year, and they still love them. the girls play with the lights under blanket forts, put them in ""houses"" for their dolls and stuffed animals, and carry them as portable night lights during trips to the bathroom. they even sleep with the lights in their beds, which is fine because they are not hot to the touch. both lights have held up remarkably well, considering how many times they've been dropped (we have ordered a replacement battery for one light, and the other needs a new battery soon, too). the base, unlike the one another reviewer described, doesn't make a sound whether the lights are on it or off. we love these so much we sent them to the girls' cousins this year for christmas."
1,Do Not Purchase This!...,I purchased this to replace my old B&D toaster oven. This was a very poor choice on my part. It does not toast bread. When baking it takes forever. The temperature dial is off. I have to crank it up to 400 for 350. It is a horrible item and do not recommend it to anyone. They just don't make toaster ovens like they used to. I'm in the process of looking for a new toaster oven to replace this one. It was a waste of money and very disappointing.
1,Scary,"When used on the toast function according to the manual, the outside of the toaster got extremely hot after running for about five minutes. I mean really hot. The Black & Decker that we have gets warm on the outside, but it doesn't get hot.Perhaps this one is defective, but it's completely unacceptable. I can't believe they put this on the market."
1,where's the toast?,Bought this toaster oven yesterday and already I am dispointed! It takes a long time for it to toast. Too many knobs and directions that sound frightening! I am returning it tomorrow!!!
2,Nothing more then help,"I have seen the help in VB 5.0 and it is totaly the same as this book, but it doesn't have the hyperlinks. Well, I am not saying I don't like it bou Microsft could do a better job at writing it and put in some of their words and texts, like ""The method File SaveAs is not for use without..."""
2,A coach who hadn't played the game...,"If you've ever wondered what it would be like to get advice on sex from someone who had studied it a lot but never actually done it, this book is your chance to find out.Granted, she's married now, so now she knows what she's been talking about for all these years."
3,"Well-written, but....","I have a problem with stories where the hero is so mean to the heroine, without any justification. He even physically assaults her but she says its okay because he was ""incensed"". He had no right to be incensed! He was engaged to someone else!!"
4,How about a software program that runs on Mac OS?,"Christina Kramer has done excellent work in producing this course book. It is unquestionably the best resource available--of course, my conscience compels me to admit that it's the only such resource available. The book is certainly well written and well-organized with a surprising flaw. Some native speakers of Macedonian have informed me that a couple of the Macedonian words in the book are mistranslated.Is it too much to ask that a companion software disk be available for the Macintosh platform (it only works for the PC). There are a higher proportion of Mac users among language learners than there are among students of many other disciplines."
1,The worse learning book ever!!!!,"How can you start showing a new alphabet by writing in cursive??? The CD is useless and the book is pointless. There are words in the book that are so old, nobody in Macedonia uses the words. I am Macedonian and I don't even know the words in the book. The CD sucks. You have to do several manual actions to install it, and there is no auto-uninstalled. Waste of money and time."
5,tony in a trio,this is a great trio cd and shows off tony's gentler side that has not been captured that often
5,Long Live the Great Tony Williams. Five Stars!!!!,"The lose of drumming great Tony Williams in 97' was something the jazz community has yet to recover from. This excellent trio CD is well recorded, and is some of his most inspired work since the 60's! In the area of the recording itself; yes- there is a slight studio polish to it, but not enough to detract from the music, or the sound of the musicians. Sony was very proud of its gear(re: liner notes), but don't drop a letter of complaint, as I'm sure all the engineers are live wire types!!- hehe. Humor aside, pick up this wonderful album and remember the genius that was and is Tony Williams. cheers jb"
1,Real Junker,"This one broke after six weeks of use, worse yet it replaced a broken one that lasted three months. Never again will I buy this brand"
1,Poor Product,Brews lukewarm coffee. Control panel buttons began to crack within a few weeks of purchase. Wish I could get my $ back. Stay away from this one.
2,Not too impressed,"I think Dr. Hoffman's book ""natural therapies for MVPS"" is a way better book. This book does, however fully explain what is going on with your body, but it doesn't give good advice on therapies. You can completely change they way you feel with Magnesium and your diet. Magnesium is HUGE!! and in this book they don't even mention it as a deficiency that MVPSers have. So trust me and buy dr. hoffman's book for only $4.00!"
2,somewhat disappointed,"Saw MD and thought he wrote the book, however, it's written by two people with MVPS. Nice, but was looking for more solid information."
3,Book OK,"As an educated person I find that the book is not bad. I agree with previous reviewer about a comfort book. Also agree with others who were looking for more concrete evidence. I'm another one who is interested in seeing a third edition of Dr. Scordo's book. There are so many of us participating in her worldwide research. Her book is still so valuable. I believe the rest of these books have followed her lead, which is commendable."
3,Speculation,"As a psychologist who has MVPS, I was surprised by the comments about personalities. This is my area of expertise and research. To date there are no studies to support any particular personality with MVP. As the book states, chest pain can be fearful-that goes for anyone with any type of chest pain. Nothing new learned there. Authors have lots of speculation. Stories of others with MVP will help you learn that you are not alone. However, most other MVP books help with this. On a positive note, we can always use books on MVPS to increase the visibility of this syndrome. Only wish this was more medically based. I agree with a previous commentary that references are to a newsletter-not evidenced based medicine!"
3,"Cute, but of limited use.","I really liked the idea behind this incense burner. I hate it when the ashes fall on the table or the floor (and risk burning the house down) and I thought this burner would be the perfect solution. I also liked the way it looks. Unfortunately, it only works well with small cone-shaped incense, and even then you first need to let the incense burn uncovered for a little while before covering it with the tree burner. Any larger kind of incense will go out at any stage when covered by the burner. I guess no enough air is allowed in. Also, most incense sticks are too long to fit inside this burner. You need to either cut them down or let them burn half-way through before using this. I would not recommend it, unless you only use small incense cones."
1,Don't buy it,"First off the incense stick has to be cut or previously burned down to fit in the tree.(Tree is very short) The back of the tree has a hole the size of a quarter, so the smoke all comes out the back, not the mouth at all. Neat looking tree though..."
3,a little upset,"the product i received had been broken and appeard to have been glued back togather, it was crudly placed and is pretty obvious. i noticed it right when i took it out of the package."
1,Not as described.,"I received the ""Fortuneteller Tree Incense Burner"" on schedule but not as promised. It's maybe 6"" high although the picture shows it taller than a stick of incense. It also will not hold stick incense only cone. What a complete disappointment. I just hope I can get my money back."
2,sucks,picture is deceptive- incense goes out once placed inside. And yes it is too short to hold the incense. I recommend placing the incense inside the mouth at an upward angle. still looks cool
2,Cute but not practical,"This is a really cute piece. However my shipment failed to include the little incense holder. You can have the ""arms"" hold a stick incense, but then the ash just falls and makes a mess. It's cute, but not practical - unless you don't mind a mess with each burning."
1,Incorrect Product Description,"""Place a cone inside, and smoke issues from his mouth and top.""The top is completely closed, smoke cannot come out of the top. There is a hole in the back-middle of the tree, with an owl next to the hole.This means you cannot put a stick-style inscence inside of it until it has burned down some already, or you cut them or buy short ones. Or feed it through the hole in the back?"
4,Great stoner rock,"If you like popular stuff like Limp Bizkit or Metallica, you might not ""get"" Fu Manchu. They bring raw, crunching guitar riffs with very orinal vocals. Eddie Glass is one of the top guitarists out there- period, and this was his last Fu Manchu album before leaving for the less than stellar (no pun intended) Nebula. Lead vocalist Scott Hill won't dazzle anyone with his voice, but he fits the music perfectly. Most songs (on all Fu albums) involve some combination of cars, UFO's (no I'm not kidding) and drugs, although he never forces this issue.""In Search of..."" falls somewhere in the middle of the Fu Manchu collection. While some songs like Asphalt Risin' and especially Seahag are near stoner rock perfection, others are real duds. Check out ""Daredevil"" and ""King of the Road"" for their 5 star efforts. If you get into Fu Manchu's music, though, you will probably have to get them all!"
1,One bag worked out of all of these on 2 orders,"I had ordered two of these packages. One of these was on backorder. When I got the first shipment I filled up all bags just as advertised and sucked them down. One bag worked as advertised (the smallest one). The rest of them leaked enough air to be fully inflated in about an hour. I resealed them thinking that I must have not sealed them properly but got the same results. Even with the big one only half full it leaked.I waited for the other shipment (too late to cancel) and had EXACTLY the same results. The littlest one works but no others do.WHEN WILL I LEARN NOT TO BUY ""AS SEEN ON TV"" STUFF.."
1,BUYER BEWARE OF SHIPPING CHARGES!,"Yep, previous viewer is right, they are waaaaaay overcharging on shipping hoping you don't notice - BUYER BEWARE!"
1,CHECK THE SHIPPING CAREFULLY!!!,"I ordered these, and was SHOCKED when I noticed what they were charging for shipping! On a $5 order, they charged me $95 to ship!!! I'm not kidding. Mistake or not, I didn't wait to find out - I cancelled the order IMMEDIATELY! Don't get sucked in to a deal that sounds too good to be true!"
1,A WASTE OF MONEY,"a horrible product - cheaply made, and it leaks nonstop! I don't know how they get away with making such a shoddy product."
1,Bad Bags,"I gave this product one star because only one of the bags I tried worked. The other two bags ripped as I placed them in my closet. Ziplock bags are stronger! It would be a great product if they simply made the bags out of a stronger material. Save your time and money, don't buy this product. If anyone knows of another company who makes the same type of bag but with a stronger material please let me know."
1,Rip Off,"Although the price of the item is wonderfull, you will be charged an unbelievable shipping charge. If you notice the weight of the item is almost 16 pounds which is false. I almost fell for it."
2,Space bags are good for single use only,"As another review stated, bags are prone to micro-tears and are easily perferated with very light contact compromising the vacuum seal. Not worth the money, but yes, a good idea."
1,Ouch Ouch Ouch!,"Sure, it looks great on your cooktop. If you actually want to USE it though, this may not be the kettle for you. It is almost impossible not to burn yourself when you pick it up! If the steam that is pouring out of the coverless spout doesn't get you, you'll burn your hand when you lift up the kettle because there is nothing to protect your hand between the handle and the top of the pot. In addition, this kettle doesn't whistle, so it is definitely a poor choice for anyone who can't stand over it for ten minutes waiting for the water to boil."
5,Even the Brits loved it!!!,I recently bought a new home and needed a teapot for some visitors. Well they loved it and it is a great design!
3,archaic,"This documentary suggests that humans may have come to the Americas before 13,500 years ago and possibly not over the ice connecting Russia and Alaska. Okay, I don't have a problem with that.This documentary was just not as thrilling as I thought it would be. When I see Hindu sculptures from 2,000 years ago, I am in awe. However, there are only so many rough spearheads that I can see before I get bored. Ancient Egyptian work is wondrous, the stuff in this documentary was dull and, appropriately, primitive.This documentary may be ideal for anthropology majors and high school students who think they may want to major in that field. This might even be a good thing to watch on PBS when nothing else is on. Otherwise, it was a bit of a yawner."
1,Where is the choice for zero stars?,"This album is absolutely the worse album that has ever been made. The songs are all awful, and Celine has got to have THE WORSE VOICE of any singers that I have ever heard in my LIFE. Celine, I reccomend that before you make a new album, you begin to write your own songs, because these ballads are meaningless.So don't buy this CD, Go out and Buy Ace of Base's ""Greatest Hits"", now they can sing, unlike Celine Dion"
3,"A very good album, with flashes of brilliance","I love Celine doing what she does best in her native language. I don't know what all the words mean but, for an Englishman fluent in only his own language, a literal translation would surely spoil the flow of this excellent composition.In my opinion the album is very much along the same lines as D'eux (1995). Both are a collaberation with Jean-Jacques Goldman. Both have a collection of good background listening songs with the odd one or two that stand out as truly superb. On ne change pas is my particular favourite, but looking at other reviews it seems we all have a particular favourite.Overall a good addition to your collection if either you are an avid Celine fan, like French music or if you see it on special over Xmas."
5,A true Wall of Sound!,"I love this album.. It shows Céline's voice more than it did on D'eux. The songs are just wonderful. My favourits are: Zora Sourit (Zora Smiles.), Tous les blues sont écrits pour toi (All the blues are written for you.) and the most beautiful song on the whole album is S'il suffisait d'aimer (If only Love could be Enough.) This album reaches from different types of music. Céline is a true Wall of Sound... and wall of Emotions!"
5,Celine Dion at her finest,"This is definitely one of my favorite albums of Celine in either French or English. I love the music and her voice is in incredible shape here. The highlight of the album is definitely S'il Suffisait D'aimer, an anthem that fits everyone."
5,A must have French album,"Out of my three Celine French albums, this is the best one I own. It's hard to pick a favorite song here, but ones that stand out for me are: On nes changes pas, L'abandon, Papillon, and the title track itself. Celine gives a range of her abilities on this album, from slow songs such as Papillon, to more upbeat songs like Dans un autre monde. The only song I really don't listen to on this album is number 11, where Celine sings blues. It doesn't matter though because 11 out of the 12 songs are absolutely wonderful. You do not have to know a word of French to appreciate this album."
5,Dion and Goldman...finally reunited!!!,"Celine Dion's first collaboration with french megastar Jean-Jacques Goldman became a huge hit: It entered the Top 10 in the UK and is the best-selling french album in music history. Three years later, Dion and songwriting-genius Goldman got together again to create once more a wonderful, melancolic and intelligent masterpiece. As Celine got more and more commercial over the past years in her English recordings (One heart!), this album can be considered a jewel for all the fans who like Celine away from the mainstream. The incredibly poetic lyrics alone (Je crois toi, S'il suffisait d'aimer) are worth buying this record. Thanks to Jean-Jacques!"
5,A beau album by a beau little fille...,"No different to anything other than heaven. Beautiful melodies, tantalising lyrics that transform heart-stopping French ballads into food for the soul. Completely different from the normal Celine (high-pitched vocals), this album is simple, calm and natural. Most of the songs are soft ballads in which Celine tactfully plays her voice on the well scripted lyrics. The dance tracks are very different and each has it's own fling to it. Without any doubt, S'il Suffisait is a job , very, very, very - well done."
5,Her best album yet!,"I'm speechless. This album is truly her best. The voice, the words, in perfect harmony. If you like her- this album is a sure bet."
5,S'il Suffisait D'Aimer,"I have only been a fan of Celine Dion's music for a few years now, (as I used to think her music was too sappy), but her vocal skills are amazing and she has become a favorite of mine. This CD is one of her best. Celine has also composed the best Christmas CD on earth - ""These Are Special Times"". Even if you aren't familiar with Celine's music you owe it to yourself to buy this CD."
1,Phi Beta Need To Get A Proof Reader,Did someone NOT read this book before it was published? Ok so they do not want to read the entire manuscript because it SUCKED!!!! but at least up to page 206 where the biggest literature faux pau took place. Come on..........
4,Very funny !,Phi Beta Bimbo by Trish Jensen is very hard to explain. It was very funny with everyone pretending to someone else. It had two fun exciting romances with a nice mix of mystery. Off to read more by this author....
5,great cooker,Great cooker. Eggs come out perfect and no more hard to peel eggs. Hate to think about cooking eggs the old way again
5,Eggactly what I needed!,I just love my egg cooker! It's so convenient and cleans up easily. I've had one for a long time and purchase one just recently for my mom. Had to look for a while to find one just like the one I have.
4,"Finally, a good egg cooker!","I have purchased many egg cookers that I had to throw away after a few times in use. This one appears to be a ""keeper"". Now I am a wizard in my wife's eyes as I cook her either soft or hard-boiled eggs to perfection. Ain't life grand when you are admired?"
5,Just like old times,"40 years ago we received a Sunbeam egg cooker for a wedding present. We never thought we would use it but we certainly have. It still works but is getting really bad looking so we ordered a new one, now Oster, and it is all we have become accustomed to. Great product that we look forward to using for 40 more years. Try it, you will love it. Leilani"
4,Good Morning,"Purchased for my Sister, will pass this survey along to her, but she stated she really enjoyed it!"
5,Great Time Saver!,"I have owned 3 egg cookers, 2 of which were this brand. They are wonderful! Great time saver because you load, clean you house, etc., come back and eggs are done. No standing over, or making sure the water doesn't boil out. Would recommend this product to anyone. A great way to do deviled eggs for potlucks, etc. Enjoy!"
1,Worst Egg Cooker,"The first time I used this product, water leaked all over the counter. The bottom of the cooker burned and gave off a bad smell. Also, you cannot lift the tray out immediately after cooking the eggs because of the heat. I have used other brands of egg cookers with great success, but this one is poorly made and does not work properly."
5,Great egg cooker,"I have had one of these for years and it cooks perfectly poached or hard boiled eggs every time. The poaching dish is replacable, and there is no need to worry about melting plastic parts as written in other reviews, as long as you remember to put water in it before turning on the appliance!!"
2,Needs more instruction,"The machine makes perfect eggs when you fill it completely. However, my husband and I do not often eat 8 eggs at a time! Their solution for making less than 8 perfect eggs is to ""adjust the water level"". So far, I have tried 4 times to make 4 perfect soft-boiled eggs and 4 times I have made medium-boiled eggs. I'm a good cook and I'm frustrated with their lack of instructions. The poacher is the same way. It makes 4 perfectly poached eggs or less than four medium cooked eggs. It will hard boil any amount perfectly, but I can do that without a machine. Disappointed with Oster's lack of instruction. Maybe you can figure it out...?"
2,Disappointing Egg Cooker,"I ordered this product based on the reviews that were available at the time. I was sorely disappointed. There is no measuring cup, so all water amounts must be estimated (the unit has three ""lines"" to help, but nothing that denotes how much water to use if you wish to cook a specific number of eggs); there is no buzzer when the unit is finished, so unless you babysit it, everything ends up overcooking. This is a great unit to avoid purchasing unless you plan to always cook 8 eggs at a time and want them all hardboiled."
3,"Competent egg cooker, but","Works well, if a bit slow. Biggest let-down is the non-stick coating on the poaching tray is not very effective. Egg sticks to each of the 4 trays."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS EGG COOKER!,"When I was thinking about buying an egg cooker, I read about how the Oster egg cooker had a design flaw of a plastic lid being placed on a hot metal heating plate. But, there was only one entry that said they had a problem with it. I had no problem with this egg cooker for months. In fact it was a delight to use--the eggs came out good every time. However, just today when I used it, I came back to find that for no obvious reason, the plastic lid was melted on the heating plate. It was so bad, I was not able to pry the plastic lid off. I had to throw the whole unit--cooked eggs and all in the trash. There was no warning from previous use that this was going to happen. So, if you buy this appliance, be prepared at some unsuspecting time in the future to come back and find the plastic lid melted securely onto the heating plate. There was no way to save it."
3,Cracked eggs and cooking less than eight eggs.,"This egg cooker is ok. I bought it as a gift and use it almost every day because it uses less water and there is no clean up. The markings for the water levels for egg doneness are for eight eggs and if you only cook two to four eggs they will be VERY undercooked. That's my biggest disappontment because we want the same doneness every time and we have to guess at the water level and so our eggs are never cooked the same. Also this cooker does crack the eggs! It has done cracked many previously uncracked eggs while cooking. Lastly, most likely you will not hear the ultra quiet click when the cooker is done and your eggs will over cook."
5,Great Product,Great Product. Easy to use and reliable. My kids grew up eating poached eggs from this appliance and now they want one in their own homes.
5,Oster Egg Cooker,"So far, so good! I replaced the Sunbeam egg cooker obtained when we married 45 years ago -- it lasted that long. Now that the Sunbeam has become the Oster egg cooker, we will see how it holds up. I am pleased that the size remains the same -- compact & convenient. (The original Sunbeam had a heavy metal base and heavy plastic lid.) Thus far the Oster has worked fine. The only problem I have had is determing the correct water level -- getting used to the new measurement lines -- to get the results I want. So far the only real disadvantage I see is that I must remain in the kitchen while it is on because the ""click"" when finished is not loud enough to hear from another room. I am very glad to have an egg cooker again!I also have to comment on the amazing speed of receiving my order! It only took 2 or 3 days and I had not purchased express shipping. I was very pleased.Oster 4716 Egg Cooker"
5,quick and easy way to cook soft and hard boiled eggs,My husband wanted to eat healthier and have a good breakfast. We ordered this egg cooker and in the time it takes him to walk out and get the newspaper he has prepared 2 perfect soft boiled eggs. Easy to use and clean. We love it. Priced right too. Highly recommend.
4,Oster Egg Cooker,"Oster 4716 Egg CookerThis egg cooker is GREAT for hard boiled eggs. I have not used it yet for anything else but the hard boiled. I kept having problems with the shells sticking to my eggs over the holidays and I was soooo frustrated, but no more with this cooker. The only reason I gave it a 4 was because, the appliance doesn't have a dinger on it to let you know that the eggs are done; this would be extremely helpful because they say to remove the eggs as soon as they are done to avoid them being overcooked. I guess I will have to stay near one time, and time it myself so I know how long it takes in order to check back in time."
4,Patty,"The Oster 4716 Egg Cooker is a good, basic egg cooker. It cooks eggs in the shell to either hard boiled or soft boiled levels, or poached eggs as desired, based on the amount of water used in the cooking process. The cooker is easy to clean and compact."
5,The only way to poach an egg.,"This is the second Oster Egg cooker that I have owened. The first on was over 25 years old and was still working, however the finish was worn off from use. Follow the instructions and you will get perfect poached of boiled eggs every time, no muss of fuss. Add H20 and eggs hit the button and wait, fast and easy. Recommendation, never put the parts in a dish washer. Only negative comment is that the inside of the heating bowl is a little difficult to keep clean since you cannot immerse the unit. These cookers are hard to find in stores,for years I thought that they had stopped manufacturing them until I found them on Amazon.com."
5,Great egg cooker,We have had one of these for 30 years and it is still going strong. Bought another one for our son. They work great.
4,Egg Cooker,"It is a very interesting little machine. whether you are a college student or just someone on the go, it is really easy to make hard boiled eggs (not like it is hard) but it is very convienient."
2,Oster 4716 Egg Cooker,"Product worked great at the beginning but after a very few times of poaching, the egg gets more and more runny until now it is almost like a raw egg even after putting more water than it calls for when poaching. The next time I poach I will try putting the water up to the boiled eggs line and see if that will work. It continues to steam some but it must not be hot enough. I like the concept and I must have a defective egg poacher because the other reviews have not mentioned this problem."
4,Perfect eggs everytime,"This is a very easy to use and functional machine. Whether you want soft/hard ""boiled eggs"" or poached the egg cooker does the job.Pros:Small sizeGreat eggsEasy to useQuickCons:Parts and unit are not dishwasher safeNo finish bell (but the click the button makes is fairly loud)Poached egg tray has to be coated with butter/oil/Pam with every use-should have been teflon coated"
1,"Wonderful, And Then Combustible","This egg cooker was a true delight for several months, and was used about every other week. It was highly efficient, made eggs perfectly, and was reasonably easy to clean. Its use was as recommended by the manual.Then, two days ago the house filled with the stench of melting plastic. When it was traced back to the egg cooker, it appeared switched off but was in fact burning into overdrive. The plastic canopy had melted like Dali's clocks, and begun to sag over some hard boiled eggs left from the night before. I unplugged the cooker, and discovered that the canopy had melted into the base and was fastened tight.Not only was it completely ruined, but if this had happened when no one was at home, it might have even burned down the house!In spite of all of this device's very positive qualities, this is clearly a fatal flaw and cannot be recommended. Oster should recall this model and overhaul the design for safety purposes."
1,"Horrible, horrible, horrible design flaw","If the lid that accompanied this egg cooker was glass (as they used to be) or stainless steel, this might be a handy device. Unfortunately, the lid is plastic. And the lid is in constant contact with the part of the egg cooker that heats the water. The byproduct of this is that the lid will melt. I wish I had read the one-star reviews. They all say the same thing.Given the design of this, I can't imagine how anyone's plastic lid didn't melt. Perhaps these reviews are combined for an Oster product that's no longer on the market? One with a glass lid?Also, the instructions say that for cooking fewer than 8 eggs, more water may be necessary. But that's all. Cuisinart's egg cooker has a measuring beaker with exact marks showing how much water is necessary for how many eggs, and for what consistency: Hard, Medium, or Soft."
5,Best Egg Cooker Ever,"This egg cooker makes perfect hard-boiled eggs!They are easy to peel and cooked uniformly. I had another brand for 30 years that I finally had to let go of-its' metal base was rusted and the lid cracked.The Oster is light-weight and the lid is sturdy, the base is coated and relatively easy to clean.My roommate had never used an egg cooker before, but she says she will never go back to cooking eggs the old-fashioned way again.This is a great product!"
5,Perfect poacher!,"Thirty some years ago, we received an Oster egg poacher as a wedding gift. We used it so much that finally it wore out. For years, we went without poached eggs. I tried a cheapy electric poacher and it was a disaster, a true waste of money. However, after doing a search online, I found this Oster egg poacher and quickly ordered it. Hooray! Oster still knows how to make a great poacher!I fill the water well, using the cup that comes with a liquid cold medicine. Our eggs come out just the way we like them every time.One caution: To be sure that the eggs don't overcook, remove the lid ASAP after the red button light has gone off."
1,Hazardous cooker!,"This cooker was great for some time, then it spontaneously melted down without ever switching off. Protect your house and family and don't buy this item."
3,"Leaves a ""burnt"" discoloring","I have had other egg cookers in the past, this is the first one that looks like the cooking area is discolored like it is burnt after all uses. I have tried all different water levels and have had the same results."
5,Great Egg Cooker,This is an awesome egg cooker. I have bought 2 of them over the last 10 years because I had my first one for years and wore it out. I even bought one for my sister-in-law and shes still using hers after 5 years. You won't be disappointed.
4,egg cooker,"After a long search for an egg cooker I was pleased to find this one. Wow! I am very happy. The cooker works well and I can enjoy poached eggs every day. Living at high altitude and a very dry climate, I had to adjust the water markings slightly to get the perfect egg. I have since ordered another egg cooker for my brother."
5,Why didn't I own this years ago?!,"If you make hard boiled eggs, do yourself a huge favor and buy this. I used to hate making hard boiled eggs because removing the shells could be such a chore. The shells of the hard cooked eggs just slip right off the egg. I love this egg cooker. Soooooo easy to have perfect hard ""boiled"" or soft cooked eggs or poached eggs. This is the best gadget one can have in the kitchen if you cook eggs. It truly makes it much easier and they are always cooked just right. I have had it for many months now and I use it all the time. Easy clean up. There is often a little residue in the base -- a little vinegar takes care of it with no problem."
2,"It works, but with lots of bad features","I previously had a West Bend Egg Cooker and will be buying that again (after years of great use, just died). I wanted to try a new brand and it is a mistake. This egg cooker has no plastic handle edges so you have to use a tong to remove eggs and dirty another bowl to rinse them. Then in order to cook less eggs you have to guess the amount of water to decrease by. The West Bend egg cooker had a nice cup to measure the amount to match the number of eggs you want to cook. Also because the bottom is not flat in this model (which it IS in the West Bend), to clean the yellow residue out, you have to wipe in the grooves at the bottom, which is best to do while hot to get it out. PAIN!!! I returned both that were holiday gifts and am ordering West Bend models."
1,Disappointed,"Oster 4716 Egg CookerFor Easter, the eggs did not get hard when I attempted to hard boil them for decorating.Initially the egg poacher worked the first 2 times I attempted to soft cook the eggs, but it does not cook them to the soft stage anymore. The white of the egg is not done enough to eat.I asked my neighbor to try it and see what luck she had. Same bad luck. I would not recommend this to anyone."
4,One of the Great Innovation for Some Quick Stemed Eggs!,"I purchased it awhile ago and found it very useful. This product is user friendly. Base from the measurement for the water input, I can decide how I want my egg to be cooked(from medium, medium well, or well done). It made boiling eggs so much easier than traditional way and it is great when I want to make some egg salad or devil egg.The few downside for this product that I found it inconvenience are:- Hard to clean- When the water is out, it will need to quickly unplug it or it will melt the top of the coverThe downside of this product:"
5,"A ""green"" applicance available in only in white","After reading the Amazon reviews, we bought the Oster egg coooker--primarily to use for poaching. The product is great. Two observations:1. The poacher is nearly filled to the brim with extra-large eggs--which is fine, and if one is careful not to spill any eggwhite, cleanup takes seconds. The trick is not to let uncooked eggwhite spill onto the metal rack or the base.2. (I don't think anyone mentioned this, yet) Over time the unit will easily pay for itself. It uses only 500 watts, and, then, only for a few minutes to boil a minuscule amount of water. A pot of water, brought to a boil on the stovetop, will consume 10 times the amount of energy. Can't comment on the cost of gas, but the cost of running an electric burner to boil a pot of water--before you even start cooking!--is not cheap."
3,Really good breakfast solution - but you have to be careful,"This seems to really work well for poaching or ""boiling"" eggs. This is my second one so I'm not too sure about the life span. First lasted a year or so. The teflon on the poaching tray seems to be particularly delicate and once it has any wear, the eggs stick like super glue. I can find no place to just buy a replacement poached egg tray so I had to buy another whole unit. This time treating it with extreme care. Gentle hand wash, etc. With that, it has lasted at least for the last 6 months. Time will tell just how long it will last. However while it does work, it does an admiral job of cooking to your taste with after only a little experimenting."
1,faulty cooker,"I use my cooker daily.My first cooker lasted for 9 months. The company replaced it, but the second one bit the dust in 10 months with a faulty switch. This product needs work."
4,Would give 5 stars except for...,"if you're not listening very carefully in a rather quiet room the ""click"" to announce the egss are ready to come out is rather inaudible. A little beeper would be helpfulBut, saying that we were extremely pleased with both soft boiled eggs and poached eggs. If you fill the poacher carefully so eggs don't slop over and you grease the cups cleanup is a breeze. Also be sure to invert the boiler tray when cooking poached eggs.By the time the orange juice was poured and the toast made our eggs were perfectly done. Good job Oster."
4,It did an acceptable job,"After 35 or so years our Oster cooker succumbed to the to the melted lid syndrome. I suspect that the thermostat got stuck in the ""on"" position. It didn't receive a lot of use, perhaps twice a month.We seldom used the poacher because of the elsewhere mentioned sticking problem. However, cooking in the shell worked very well.As with everything else, judging by recent reviews they have cheapened it up despite it being about the most costly cooker on Amazon.My principal issue with it was that the unit couldn't be submerged. This may also be true for all cookers; I haven't checked yet.In any event, we need to buy a new one and am unsure about which model to replace it with. I hardly expect to get another 35 years out of the next purchase, not that I expect to live that long."
5,Fast and easy!,This is by far the best and easiest way to hard boil eggs. I love it! I have no time to boil eggs (the stove top way) so this is perfect. I've been using it everyday to boil eggs. I work out every day and this is perfect for getting my protein in. I eat about 8 eggs a day so I make sure to make two batches of hard boiled eggs. This egg cookers is a life saver for me and it's so fast not to mention easy to peel the eggs. I love it! Perfect for what I need it for:) Easy to clean as well!
2,Cooks great eggs; unit poor quality,"I had a love-hate relationship with my egg cooker. Loved the way it cooked eggs but it was very difficult to clean. The poaching tray was terrible as it was impossible to clean. Supposedly it is teflon but it is not. I don't know what it is, I just know it's not teflon and egg sticks horribly even with butter. The inside aluminum tray for boiled eggs is difficult to clean and the paint or coating on the base unit started flaking off into the eggs. I used it frequently for about 3 years and threw away the poaching tray. The only way to actually clean it is to put straight vinegar in the base and let it run a cooking cycle. But then your house stinks of vinegar.Bottom line - great design, very poor materials."
4,great purchase,I finally can hardboil eggs without dreading the chore. I'm glad I read reviews on this product. I never thought I would own such an appliance. It cooks my hardboiled eggs perfect everytime. Peeling is so simple. I've tried different ways to boil eggs on stove and never had much luck. some would peel easy the remainder would be put into the garbage. I've only used it to hardboil eggs thus far. My only change i would've liked is to have an actual bell or something to make you aware that it is finished. It shuts off automatically but no finish bell.
4,gift,"came on time, great gift idea, loved the product, wonderful service, nice to have around when you need good egg cooker"
5,Great Egg Cooker!! The Best!!,Absolutely wonderful!!! The very best...we have attempted to order other products and this was incredible!!
1,dangerous,I gave this product a 1 because in the short time I've owned it and after the few times I used it the darn thing didn't shut off. It got so hot the cover melted to the base and would not come off. I had to throw the whole unit away. It was very dangerous and actually could have started a fire!I've had several egg cookers in the pass and none of them did this including the cheaper ones.thanks
3,egg breakers,The sharp pointed egg breaker broke away immediately. When I try to hard boil eggs following directions exactly the eggs are not hard boiled.
2,Egg Cooker,"This egg cooker has too many variables.....to get close to a perfect egg you have to take into consideration the size of the egg, how much water you put in the cooker, whether the water is warm or cold. Too much work for just eggs. Easier to put it in a pan on the stove."
3,Fire hazard,Be careful if you own this one! It worked terrific until the sensor quit and it kept heating. It melted the top right onto the base and was smoking out (presumably) toxic plastic fumes.It will sound odd but I would not necessarily throw it out unless you cannot be in the room with it. Just don't leave it alone!I did throw mine out but kept the metal pieces from inside to use in a shallow pan of water to poach my eggs.
1,Caution,"Almost had a fire with this product. I had one of these for several years before and loved it, that was why I ordered this one, and I was very familiar with the proper use of it, but the top of this one melted when I used it. Not sure if I could recommend it with a clear conscience."
3,Eggzactly,"It works!Just a couple of things I don't like. The poacher gets stuck in the lid and the eggs get stuck in the poacher. It doesn't matter if you use oil or not. (Being teflon you're not supposed to have to use anything, but I guess they used an inferior batch for mine.)I had a sunbeam before, don't know where it disappeared to, one of those things that happen when you move, I guess. The lid in it had gradations so you could put the right amount of water in it for how you wanted your eggs to turn out. Don't try that with the lid on this cooker unless you want to water your shoes."
4,Perfect Poached Eggs,"I bought this item primarily for it's poaching capability, with which I'm very happy -- and I'm a perfectionist when it comes to poaching eggs!As for soft-boiling, I'd say not so hot. They don't come out any worse than in a pot of water but not any better, either, and it takes longer. The reason, of course, is that eggs vary in size and you have to experiment with each size to get the water quantity in the steamer just right so that the egg cooks the white without overcooking the yolk, and even when you do it takes 2-3 times longer than in a pot of boiling water.But again, it's GREAT as an egg poacher!"
5,Where did it go?,How can such a fabulous product be discontinued? I want to purchase one for another location and am very dissappointed. I guess this goes into the same category as why there is no longer Altoids gum. Oh wel..
1,Fatal meltdown: Perfect eggs every time???,"Unit failed on second use, with lid melting into base. Reviewed instructions and find no user error. Product not recommended. Will purchase West Bend 86628 as replacement."
5,EGG COOKER,You don't need to watch over boiling water to cook eggs anymore. Just set it and go! Love it.
3,I was disappointed ...,"... with my purchase. I selected the Oster based on reviews by others and the automatic shut-off feature. While this model does quit cooking at the appropriate time, you STILL have to go over and unplug it or else your eggs will continue to cook. The only ""notification"" that your eggs are done is the click when the button pops out. If you are not nearby, it is VERY easy to miss. ;("
2,Not great for poached eggs,"It took about 15 minutes to poach or soft boil an egg. Even after 15 minutes, the whites on the top of the egg were still runny even though the rest of the egg was cooked.I bought the cooker specifically to cook poached eggs; I did not try to hard boil any eggs, so I do not know how that works. I assume it would be fine but that it would take at least 20 minutes.If you want to poach eggs, I would not recommend this cooker."
4,Oster 4716 egg cooker,Works well. It would be helpful if it had a loud signal when the unit was done. The hardboiled eggs can easily overcook when left in the unit. They take approximately 20 minutes and it is not practical to stay near the cooker. It is a good concept.
1,It lasted about two months,"I do not give 1-star reviews lightly. After reading the amazon reviews I decided to purchase this item, since my wife wanted to try a diet that included hard boiled eggs most every morning. We received our item on 9/26/07, and used it approximately 4-5 times per week. This morning, 12/4/07, I noticed an odd smell and some popping sounds, and sure enough, the lid had melted into the base. I'm not entirely sure what caused this to happen, but I'm a bit upset about the product lasting all of two months and my house smelling like burned plastic.*UPDATE* The oster customer service was exceptional in replacing the melted lid, and for some reason I never had the problem again. I wonder if perhaps a bit of raw egg had somehow gotten onto the sensor and caused it to heat for too long. It has been over a year since the incident."
1,Doesn't Last!,"My family loves hard boiled eggs. Based on favorable reviews, I bought an Oster Egg Cooker in April 2007. It's my first egg cooker and we loved the perfect hard boiled eggs. It's very easy to use -- just fill the unit with water to the line, pierce the eggs (piercer is on the holder), place the eggs in the holder, put the lid on and press the start button. The Oster also cooks soft boiled and poached eggs but unfortunately never got around to trying other eggs as the unit malfunctioned and melted the cover after only 6 months! I followed the directions to the T and the automatic shut off should have averted any overheating. My entire house stunk with the smell of melted plastic. Extremely dissatisfied with the poor service life of this appliance (used approx 3 times per month - which means it malfunctioned after less than 20 uses!). I plan to buy another egg cooker, but it definitely won't be an Oster!"
4,"Solid, Basic but not Spectacular","I'm finding I have to watch the cooking time very carefully. Poached eggs will overcook if I wait for the unit to shut off. Same with the hard boiled, I use a kitchen timer and am still trying to arrive at the correct timing, the water level suggestions have not worked for me. I'm confident once I get the timing down it will be great...had hoped this wouldn't be necessary. Also wish it had a buzzer to alert when finished."
5,satisfied,"satisfied. I've owned this for about two months now.....plastic top certainly hasn't melted. Eggs come out exactly how you want them too. Uses SO much less water than boiling an egg on the stove, and I presume less energy as well."
3,No flow,I agree with some of the other reviewer's. I just didn't catch the flow or love.I thought it would be there but in the end it was heavily depressing to me.
3,This movie is difficult for this American to understand,"We had some difficulty understanding the English accents in the beginning. But more important, this lovely story is so chopped up, going from the present to the past and back again, that my husband gave up in disgust after saying Who's he? and I told him it was the main character. Everyone in this movie is very very thin. The actors, nonetheless, are beautiful."
4,Charming Love Story,"Lovely, charming story, although long war scenes. The main characters are lovely to watch, especially Eddie Redmayne, who is also in ""My Week with Marilyn."" This is a beautiful period piece."
1,Not Masterpiece Theatre Quality,The story was very hard to follow. Language was hard to understand. The movie should have been X-rated for nudity and sex! I was so glad that I watched it by myself before letting 13 year old watch it. I thought that all Masterpiece movies were okay for family viewing but this was shocking. I threw the DVD in the trash!!
3,No longer trust PBS or Masterpiece Theatre,"Wonderful story but very disappointed in the very private sex scenes in the story.Had I known of the explicit scenes, I would not have purchased this movie.I love trading and passing on movies with my daughter and my granddaughters but this is NOT a movie I would encourage a 16 and an 18 year old watch.I have felt that I could always trust in PBS to have wholesome and healthy movies for the whole family, and this is not one of them."
2,Birdsong on Blu-Ray,"This was released in Europe in it's original widescreen format on Blu-Ray. It is going to be released here in a fullscreen format (1:33). Why? I don't know. Maybe it's because a lot of PBS watchers in the US still watch on their old format (4x3) TVs? Whatever the reason, it is crazy to release a Blu-Ray widescreen movie in a Blu-Ray fullscreen format in this day and age. But hey, we are backward in a lot of things. The Europeans had widescreen TV long before we did. So, don't waste your money on this one until they release it properly, if you want to watch it properly."
1,Universal JOKE,Delphi SA10081 XM Universal Audio Adapter would not connect to my XM Roady antenna; the cable connector diameter is too large.
5,Fast and accurate,"I'm very pleased with the device I ordered so I can listen to my XM radioin my new (used) car. It works perfectly, and I received it faster thanI had expected.This product is hard to find these days but they had it in stock.Thumbs up all the way around!"
3,Not needed for SkyFi2,This item is not needed for the SkyFi2 system. That tuner has a built in modulator.
1,There Has To Be Something Better,I purchased a new vehicle that didn't have a cassette player so I needed something else in which to use my XM Radio. This product is a real disappointment compared to the cassette adapter. Stations continuously fade in-and-out and if you travel long distances you often need to change the radio frequency.
3,It was just alright...,Let me start by saying EJD is my favorite author. I enjoyed his previous books. When ever he releases a new book I rushed to the book store to purchase his work. This book was ok but wasn't his best. I guess I expected a little more excitement. He will continue to be my favorite writter.
3,Pretty good...but not the Best,This was the first time that I have ever really NOT liked one of Dickey's characters... I didn't hate Dana.. but I almost found myself wishing that she and Vince wouldn't make it. The book was a pretty good read...but for once I found that I didn't feel...in touch... with the characters. The storyline was interesting and well thought out.. but the characters didn't draw me in. I suggest that you read this book on a leisure journey... It wasn't nearly as compelling as some of his other works....
4,Is truly what it is,A good story of drama but to many dull points in the book. But the drama made-up for it.
3,Not what I expected,"I guess I expected more because I have read all his books up to this point and hadn't been disappointed.It was just a story No plot, no nothing. I hope the new one coming out restores my faith in his writing. He's still my favorite though."
3,liars surprise,"THIS BOOK WAS NOT ALL THAT ,I AM SURPRISED AT ERIC JEROME DICKEY.THIS IS NOT LIKE HIS WORK AT ALL .NONE THE LEAST I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED.MOST OF THESE CHAPTERS DRAGGED ,AND HAD A VERY BAD ENDING.I HOPE HIS NEXT BOOK IS NOT THIS BAD"
3,This book almost didn't get finished.,This book almost didn't get finished. It started off slow and BORING! It did eventually capture my attention with all the juicy drama that finally came.
3,Good Enough,"I recently snatched this book off of the shelf as soon as it came out in paper back. The book wasn't a page turner like most of his novels have been for me but overall it was a good book. I would recommend this book as a good read,although it doesn't top Milk or Sister, Sister"
3,Fast paced,"EJD does a great job in telling this tale of difficult love finally come together. It would be great to see one story where the woman is meaner and not so accepting of the things that happen prior to her deciding to forgive the man anyway, or vice versa."
3,Alright,"This book was pretty good,an easy read.there's a part at the ending that kinda dissapointed me dealing with another child in the eqaution,i also wish there was more talk about happened in their marrige and so forth."
4,Great Summer Read!,"Eric Jerome Dickey never disappoints. I even shed a tear at the end. Very touching, memorable, and relatable characters!"
3,What Can I Say?... EJD does it again!,"The only reason I rated this 3 stars instead of 4 stars is because I've been quite spoiled by reading EJD's other books. I am a truly, spoiled lady; and EJD made me that way. He is a woman's (and maybe a man's) novelist god!I really liked the strife in the lead characters' relationship as it was raw and like something we've all felt during our young, heartfelt relationships. The fact that ex's and children were involved only made the story more real and complex... and more difficult to take sides.I completely understood Vince's need to protect his child and ex-wife's 'memory' from his new woman, but also understood her frustration with his inability to let go of the past, make her queen, and continue with their own life, together.The dips and turns made this book so real and so worth reading .... it was as if I was reliving parts of my own past."
2,Game Over.......,"As a loyal ""Friends and Lovers"" fan, Liar's Game was a big disappointment. None of the character possessed the charm or complexity I have become accustomed to in previous EJD novels. Dana was a poor example of a woman, a true ""bag lady"" with emotional issues, financial debt and open scars from a previous relationship. She overreacted, and overanalyzed everything Vince said or did to her, but didn't seemed alarmed by her best friend's dangerous night job or poor taste in men. Vince was meek and vulnerable, and allowed Dana to trample all over his heart and then attempt to give him advice on how to repair his relationship with his daughter- with disastrous results. Harmonica was the only decent character, and for all his efforts to share his wisdom it feel on deaf ears.I have always appreciated the interweaving plots in Dickey's books, but this particular story line had too much drama, and not enough depth for a real connection with the reader."
2,Could have been better!!,"After reading all of Eric Jerome Dickey's books, this one disappointed me the most. Not only was it hard for me to concentrate on the book itself, but I could not feel any of the characters (especially not the lead female). The thing that really disappoints me is that when I try to recall specific parts in the book, I go blank. Nothing really stood out, except Miss Thang forwarding his calls to her pager, or the fact that she had to go to the bathroom to much. Even though this book was a disappointment to me, I will continue to buy others because I simply love his writing style and characters."
1,SOS... Same Ole Situations..,"This was not my favorite book and I could not finish it. In the beginning of the book, the character Vince sounded just like Tyrel of Friends & Lovers, Jordan in Milk in My Coffee, Stephan & Darnell in Cheaters. I can't distinguish one book from another. Eric Dickey may be a talented writer, however all of his books are ""just alike"" only characters with different names, but same quick-wit, fast talking, ghetto-fabulous personalities. His writing is Commerical Fiction at its best and that's why he's on the New Times Best Sellers list and I understand why. I'm not hateing on a brother, but I would like to read some stories from him that deal with characters who are more developed and have depth to their lives. I will keeping reading his works, hopefully I will be able to get through the next book without hearing the same voices and stories again."
2,Not his best work....,"I am an avid reader of Eric Jerome Dickey's books and this is not his best work. When I first heard about this book I bought it on the release date and expected it to be a book full of serious drama based upon the title. Was I ever so ""wrong"". This book didn't live up to it's title at all. The lies that were told were very petty which lacked drama like someone getting caught cheating and having to deal with the reprecussions. I was not a good read at all, quite dull. The only good part in the book was the end."
3,Novel review,"This intricate novel is based on the relationship of Vincent Brown, and Dana Smith. they meet at a club in california, and in that instant they start telling lies to each other. as their feelings get deeper they have to tell the truth. Vince has to tell about his ex- wife, child and the night the everything hit the fan. Dana has to tell vince about her ex- long term boyfriend, who is unaware that he and Dana have broken up. As the truth comes out the shock, and dissappointment tske its toll on their relationship, that once seemed so strong. This is a great book for mature teens and Adults."
2,"Slow, couldn't even finish","I got to the middle of this book and was still waiting for something to happen. A book needs to jump of within the 1st 30 pages. Halfway through this book, I still didn't know where it was going. I'm all for suspense, but it seems like Dickey was still deciding what he wanted to do with these characters. I probably will not finish this book."
2,I don't realy think this was good.,I thought this book was going to better than this. I am a teenager and this is more of a adult book so I didn't really enjoy this. The book was really realistic in the way people deal with situations and jealousy was a big thing in the book. Jerome Dickey may be a good author but it didn't show in this novel.
3,Should've came betta...,"I absolutely loved Cheaters, thus when i found out that he had another book coming out I purchased it the first week it hit the book stores. All I have to say is WHY WHY WHY WHY...WHY did I waste my time anticipating LIARS GAME, and why was I disappointed."
3,I give him an E for Effort.....,"I just finished reading Liar's Game. Once again sisters were portrayed in a negative light. Fisrt Dana's gum licking, up and down , and up and down; grew tired of it. Could not relate to lots of the descriptions. On a positive note, an easy read,and a great book for laughs."
3,Not Up to Par,"I've been reading Eric Jerome Dickey from the beginning and I think he is a fantastic author but after reading Liar's Game I felt a little let down (no really a lot let down). I think my expectations were too great and I ended up disappointed. This novel in my opinion was just not up to the usual standards of Mr. Dickey. I loved Sister Sister, Friends & Lovers, Milk in my Coffee, and Cheaters but Liars' Game just didn't do anything for me. I've read my fellow reviewers comments but this was simply one novel I had wished I had gotten from the library. I will continue to be a fan of Mr. Dickey."
2,it only gets two stars because i finished it...,"is it just me, or are ejd novels are starting to read alike? vince and dana could've been characters in any of his other books and he should come up with better plots. if i were a dad and my ex wouldn't let me see my child, she wouldn't get nada, but vincent sends his money to her like the poor schlep that he is... eric may be talented, but it seems to me, that maybe he is starting to run out of ideas...milk in my coffee will always be my favorite ejd book.but maybe we have seen the best of him?"
3,Not Eric's Best,"This book had entirely too much Drama for me. Vince and Dana's relationship was not very strong from the start. And their previous relationships did not help the situation get any better. There was a lot of distrust between them.Some of the issue were not believable. I know that is fiction but come on. I was hoping that somebody had a drama free life. It shocked me that every character had a distrust factor.Overall the book was good, but not as good as his previous books. The reviews will let you know to each her/his own."
3,Too much drama,"The storyline seemed to drag on and I quickly read it because I had started it. Both Dana and Vince lacked character and had it not been for Harmonica's wisdom the entire book would have been pointless. I really couldn't relate to the characters as they all seemed so untrustworthy, selfish and lacked maturity and depth. I understand this is ""fiction"", but the majority of the characters needed to seek both spiritual and psychological counseling. The ""fight"" had to be the most dramatic. I've read all of EJD's books and this one was the most disapointing. Hopefully his next book will have more depth."
2,"A Big, Fat Disappointment","I was very disappointed by this book. Perhaps my first clue was the fact that this book could not hold my attention. I must have put it down and picked it back up a hundred times before it actually got interesting to me. Couple that with Dana's irritating personality traits and Vince's baby-mama-drama and you have the makings of a not-so-great book. I have always been a fan of EJD, and have read all of his other books, but Liar's Game was almost enough to make me change my mind. Better luck next time...."
2,Not A Good Read,This book was very hard to get into.I've read several of EJD books but Liar's game is by far the worse.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME
2,Unsatisfied with product,"I will not order from this seller again. The shipment took to longer and if you're ordering with this seller and the description says ""Like New""...take it's as ""Just Readable"" even if that because it was dirty and in very bad condition! I'm very disappointed!"
4,No. 1 author,"I like this book. I like the way that Eric Dickey related this book to Cheaters. I notice that Dana and Dawn are cousins. I like the way I relate to Eric Dickey books. I haven't been all the things that he write about but I have people who have. When I'm reading one of his books, I can visually see people acting out what I'm reading, like I'm watching a movie instead of reading a book. Eric Dickey, in my opinion, is the best author I ever read. He was the one that interest me into books. I wanted something that keep my attention and his books really did that."
5,Liar's Game,"Hello Mr. E J Dickey, My name is Erica B. and I'm from Phila.,Pa(PHILLY) I would like to say another job well done!! I love your writing. Liar's Game was so deep!! :) I didn't think you could get any deeper than your book ""Cheater's"". Buuut....you have..(Smile :p) You keep writing, I'll keep reading. God bless and good-bye."
3,Entertaining,"This latest book by Mr. Dickey is just simply ""entertaining"". It provokes no deep thought whatsoever. The characters are somewhat believeable as are the situations but the ending left me scratching my head. His previous novels I think were more well written than this one."
2,Struggle to Finish!!,"Liar's Game was a struggle for me to finish. The author was repetitive on how Dana felt about Vince's relationship with ex-wife and daughter, as well as how Vince felt about them. Dana was a selfish soul, who did not want a man with children (bottom line). Personally, I feel that with the drama Vince and Dana went through, they both needed to close this chapter in their lives and go their separate ways. (Call it a TKO!!) However, I was not surprised by the outcome, typical EJD style. Not your best EJD!!!"
3,HE HAD BETTER,KNOWING ERIC JEROME DICKEY I WENT TO THE BOOK STORE THE MINUTE THIS BOOK CAME OUT AND BROUGHT THE HARDCOVER. IMAGINE MY SURPRISE WHEN I DIDN'T REALLY LIKE IT. MAYBE IT'S B'CUZ I READ ALL HIZ OTHA BOOKS AND THOUGHT THIS ONE WOULD B EVEN BETTA. DON'T GET ME WRONG IT'S GOOD BUT I WAS WONDERING WHEN THE LYING WAS GONNA START. EVEN THOUGH I'M SAD TO SAY I WOULD SUGGEST BUYING THE PAPERBACK OR BORROWING IT FROM THE LIBRARY.
5,Awesome,This book really held my attention and was very juicy throughout. This author has a way with keeping a readers attention to what is going on and describes very well.
4,Damn that boy is good!,"I agree with everyone else, that Dickey did it again! I love the way he tells his stories and he always gives us a good drama. However, in this book I didn't particularly care for the characters especially Dana. She seemed too petty and I hated the fact that Vince was so weak. I definitely found myself more pulled into some of his other work but all in all, I still couldn't put the book down because my opppositional views of Dana and others kept me reading and unable to put the book down."
3,I give this a B-,"I am a huge fan of EJD and loved all of his books, especially Cheaters, so I anticipated this book, but I must say that I was a little bit disappointed. This book was like a mystery to me, I could not figure out where the story line was going, even as it came to an end. I loved all of the characters, especially Gerri, Harmonica, Womack and Rosa Lee. They all represented real people to me and I felt like they were people I knew. At times Vince and Dana got on my nerves, she was semi-ghetto and he had no spine at times. I am glad they were able to face their fears together and work through them.This was a different twist for EJD and I like his writing style but this was not one of his better books. I give him a B- for this because over all he's an excellent writer with a great imagination."
3,Disappionted,"I have read all of EJD's books and whenever I finshed one I was always left wanting more. Not the case this time. At the turn of each page I kept asking when are we going to get going. We never did! Midway through the book I found myself reading faster and faster just get through with it. Alot of empty pages. I know that EJD can do better, and I hope that his next work will show it."
3,Game of Emotions,"This is the second Dickey novel that I have read and it was not as good as the first. I got tired of the back and forth lies and games played by the key characters. There was no reality to the novel as far as I was concerned. I was looking for an adult fiction novel. Dickey is a great author, it is just not prevelent in this novel.If you are interested in the lives of cheating rap producers,under-age illiterate rappers, obnoxious men and women of low self esteem, this book is for you. Otherwise pick another Dickey novel!"
2,My first EJD book & Dana got on my nerves!,"I wanted Vince to buy her a final Big Mac and send her back East to the world she said she craved. Eventhough she pumped ip Vince with guts to demand to see his daughter, her selfishness nawwed at my nerves. On every other page, there was a similie, that also rankled my nerves. I will read another EJD, just because I am curious if they all do sound alike."
3,"Good, but certainly not his Best","As usual Dickey did a good job writing this book. It was very detailed and full of plots. As w/ all of his other novels, he made the characters seem realistic and alive. But what I didn't like & have noticed it in his other books, is how he portrays the male characters as being weak-minded individuals. There was so much that Vince took from Dana that any real black brotha would not have stood for. There was deception when the two first met. Honesty is always the best policy and what more to build a relationship on but HONESTY! I was hoping that there would have been a better story line for Vince and his daughter. All in all this book was enjoyable."
4,"Lies, Lies and more Lies","One lie lead to another lie and so on and on. Just tell the truth from just start.EJD is one of my favorite authors. I've been with him from the beginning and still holding on strong. I enjoyed reading this DRAMA filled novel. From reading some of the reviews it appears that some readers didn't care a great deal for Dana. I liked her. Yes, she made some stupid mistakes but who hasn't?As always, I enjoyed the unique writing style of this great author. All the characters were exciting. If you haven't read this novel yet, you are missing a treat. Be Blessed!"
3,If you've read one Dickey Book ...,"This book is pretty much the same -- like his others. Women being made to look like they don't have it going on up stairs. As for the book content. No man, not one that really wanted a good relationship (or any at all) would allow someone to keep him from his child. Especially, when it would have been so easy for the author's main character to get help from the law. It's nice that the book was dedicated to his two daughters ..."
5,Worth the money spent!,"The characters in Eric Jerome Dickey's book Liar's Game were so real! Anyone who reads this book will be able to relate to at least one of the characters. Dickey kept me in suspense with the Vince and Dana triangle. I've been there, done that. It always good to see someone portray a man in a positive light. Not ALL men think with their ""other leg"". It was also a pleasure to see African Americans as professionals, not on Welfare. Kudos to Mr. Dickey. I look forward to reading all of his future masterpieces!"
5,ANOTHER GREAT BOOK,"Outstanding writer!!!! I've read all of Eric Jerome Dickey's novels and can honestly say I have not been disappoint. Liar's Games hits a very important topic... Love and Betrayal. We see the true side of Dana when she is told the truth by Vincent that he was once married and have a little girl. As always, all the characters are exciting. There is a lesson that everyone will learn from this novel. Just remember the wise advise Harmonica gives Vincent in LIAR'S GAME."
5,Liars Game,"Liars Game is by far one of the best books I have ever read. There is never a dull moment from beginning to end. I was disappointed and upset when I completed the book. I wanted more and needed more. Therefore, I wrote Mr. Dickey an e-mail asking him to please write a sequel, because it would be unfair to leave his readers in such turmoil. Go get the book, because it is worth every dollar plus more!!!Sonya P."
5,Skeletons in open closets...,"I am enjoying Dickey's depiction of the late twentysomething and 30's crowd. What's really enjoyable about this book is the things that I'm learning and his use of non-fictional references. It's nice to read fiction that seems so realistic. Plus, alot of kudos for his use of everyday language that has me laughing out loud, especially when describing his characters. For example, I got a good laugh at his description of Harmonica, and how a 'crop of razor bumps lived under his chin'. And how Harmonica says 'brang'. I wasn't expecting all these little extra treats that makes this book so enjoyable.Keep up the excellent work and I'll keep buying.Thanks."
2,A major disappointment!,"I was once a huge fan of Mr. Dickey. In my opinion, his early writing definitely raised the bar in the genre of African American fiction. I don't understand what happened. Since Milk in My Coffee, his work has sunken to the level of the writers he once wrote circles around. Liar's Game is a prime example. The plot is weak, the characters weaker and the writing is sophomoric at best. Lia's Game fluctuates between being overwritten and underwritten, leaving the reader feeling both frustrated and disappointed. On several occasions I found myself asking ""Who would say this???"" I don't know if Mr. Dickey is feeling pressure from his publishers to crank out more stories but it definitely feels that way. I wish he would slow down and write more of the great fiction that made us love him in the first place."
3,"Good, but not great","Eric Jermone Dickey is a great writer. That we all know, however, this book left me wanting a little more. This is one of those few times where I actually found myself rooting for the couple to part ways. The character Dana, was completely selfish and a bit on the mentally challenged side. Vince was a good man, but I just wanted him to take charge of his life better than he did. The book dealt with relationships realistically, but I think I just wanted a little bit more romance, which Dana just wouldn't provide. The Naomi spin was good and I'm glad that he brought a bit of closure to that one. All in all, it's a good read."
5,DRAMA! DRAMA! DRAMA!,"I love the way Mr. Dickey express his thoughts through writing. I enjoyed every character. The book club I'm in got a kick out of how he describes women in passing. I do believe Jerome Dickey is one of the top male authors in the country. I must admit this book was great, however it doesn't compare to Cheaters."
3,"Entertaining EJD Style, But Not His Best Work","Like all of his other works, I found Liar's Game to contain the usual Eric Jerome Dickey style, humor, and plot that is sure to entertain. However, like other readers have mentioned, I found Vince and Dana and their relationship too familiar -- revamped from his earlier books. Their story was good enough, but not nearly as clever as his prior works; nor were Vince & Dana anymore intriguing as supporting characters -- Juanita & Naomi, Womack & Rosa Lee. My boyfriend correctly states that Liar's Game does not show any creative growth from Cheaters. But first time Eric Jerome Dickey readers should really enjoy Liar's Game and, afterwards, be eager to read his prior books."
4,ABOVE AVERAGE WWII ACTION FILM,"ONE OF THE MORE REALISTIC WWII FILMS TO COME OUT OF HOLLYWOOD. THE OSCAR WINNING SCRIPT ACCURATELY PORTRAYS THE TRIBULATIONS OF A COMPANY OF GRUNTS DURING THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE. MEMORABLE SCENE: A NEWLY ARRIVED PRIVATE RUNS OVER TO A NEARBY COMPANY TO FIND A FRIEND IN THE OUTFIT. HE IS TOLD THE MAN WAS KILLED THE PREVIOUS EVENING DURING ENEMY SHELLING BUT IS THANKED FOR PROVIDING A NAME SO THE SGT CAN COMPLETE HIS REPORT. DEJECTEDLY HE WALKS AWAY SAYING ""YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HIS NAME."" TO WHICH THE THE SGT REPLIES,""WE DIDN'T EVEN FIND HIS DOG TAGS! EVEN THOUGH HIS BACK IS TO THE CAMERA, THE PRIVATE'S REACTION IS MEMORABLE. STEVEN SPIELBERG CITED THIS MOVIE AS ONE OF HIS INSPIRATIONS FOR SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. KUDOS TO A GREAT CAST AND ANOTHER GREAT FILM DIRECTED BY ""WILD BILL""WELLMAN."
4,One of the better WW2 movies,"Based on the real life Battle of Bastogne this film has plenty of action for everyone. Starring Van Johnson and ably assisted by James Whitmore, John Hodiak, Ricardo Montalban, George Murphy and Marshall Thompson this film takes a realistic and gritty look at the real horrors of war. Members of the real ""Battered Bastards of Bastogne"" who actual fought the battle round out the cast and add authenticity to the film. A good addition for any collection."
5,A film to know Van Johnson,"When I heard of Van Johnson's passing, I immediately recalled seeing this film on TCM a couple of times. This was a great war film and a very fine performance for Van Johnson. He was an actor who was hard for me to pin down and he suffered from some poor films, but he always conveyed the look of a person whom you would be glad to know. This is true for this film too. The other cast members were also effective. This is a story that does not try to make false heroes. I got the feeling that the emotions were true for someone caught in this type of extreme stress. For many reasons, this is a film worth keeping."
5,Top Notch War Flick!,"Excellent story of the 101st Airborne at the Siege of Bastone. This was probably the most famous of the battles held by the Americans. The movie shows life in the filth, mud, and snow quite well. You of course, don't get the true story of the whole battle, movies don't do this well except in documentarys.Filmed in 1949 this movie stars a lot of people who had actually seen the elephant.Van Johnson didn't serve in the army due to a plate in his head from a motorcycle accident. But James Whitmore was (I believe) a Lt. in the USMC in the South Pacific. Some of the others had been in the war also.One of the three best war movies of all time, the others are Twelve O'Clock High and Command Decision."
4,Absolute Classic WW-II Movie!,"Great Action, great actors, with good humor make this one of the best WW-II movies ever. It is a classic and still popular today. It gives a well rounded view of the life of the soldier in WW-II and seems to be a historically accurate portrayal of the siege of Bastogne.This is worth viewing just to see Spencer Tracy and Van Johnson in great roles. A great movie for anyone who loves this genre of movie. A must to own! One of my personal favorites."
4,"Bastogne, Belgium, Dic 1944!","Battlegorund was for its time the most ambitious recreation about Bulge's battle during WW2. (Lately Ken Akin would make a remake in 1965, but without reaching the astonishing spark of this film).The film by itself received five nominations and two awards. Nominated as Best Film, Best Direction (William Wellman), Best supporting actor (James Whitmore), won as Best Script and Best Photograph.Realistic and superbly filmed (although for some, it may be dated). A must-see."
3,A good warmovie,"Premiere: 1949Directed by: William A. WellmanGenre: warmovie > historical movieBattleground is o.k. It is the same theme as the serial Band of Brothers without the scenes before war. For the time of the production after World War II this is a very respectable US-warmovie, because Wellman shows realistic fear, mud, cold, misery and poor equipement of the american soldiers. The performances of Van Johnson, John Hodiak, James Whitmore and Marshall Thompson are very good. Ricardo Montalban, Richard Jaeckel, or James Arness are well.A little bit negative is the stereotypic action in the snowwoods with the small skirmishes. I think the real war was more dirty, danger, dramatical and desperate for the individual soldier.However, Wellman made a good movie. The best charakter is the good, old James Whitmore."
4,One missing item,It may not portray war as realistically as we do in 2004. It covers everything soldiers went through except the most private functions (there is nothing private in the Army). That is the way it was; if only you could feel how cold it was! I'm sorry that you could not put out a DVD of the colorized version because it was well-done. That is the missing item. Colorized I would give it 5 stars. You need to see this movie because it is the true story of any number of GIs in the 101st. Go Airborne!
3,Battleground,"The story was good, but the quality of the DVD was poor. The sound was very poor. In parts, I could barely hear it; in other parts, it was very loud (irrespective of the gunfire)."
5,THE COOLEST COREY HAIM MOVIE!,"I am watching this movie right now on tv and it's just so cool! It's set in the future when Corey Haim is a rollerskater and joins the Rollerboys gang to tip off the police on all the bad things they do. While doing this he delivers pizzas and takes care of his little brother. I know many people might think it's a corny movie but to me it's so bad that it's good! And for all you 80's kids, COREY HAIM LOOKS HOT! He's hot enough that you can fry an egg off the screen! SIZZLING! Definitely the better looking Corey!"
5,Very Fun Movie!,"despite some nasty reviews i've read so far, i think that this is a great movie. It's fun, has an original storyline, and the actors performed very well, particularly Morgan Weisser (Bullwinkle) and Christopher Collet (Gary Lee)....The movie has some great skating sequences and they make you want to skate along with them...."
3,I like this one,"I like this one due to the fact that when i watched it i was well into the rollerblading scene. Its a good movie about a guy who tries to save his little brother becoming a drug addict, on a new drug called 'mist', the punch line is however, this drug makes the user completely impotent. This is a ploy from the Rollerboys themselves to make the America a better place, after its downfall. They call the drugs affects 'the day of the rope'. Corey Haim then comes into play as a hot shot rollerblader, who needs to convert to a rollerboy to save his little bro. By converting he is pushed into a life of sex hungry women, and beating up innocent civilians. This is a good film, but it only deserves three stars due to the fact that its quality and content and not upto todays standards, still i urge you to buy this one."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED...,"To Whom It May Concern:This item was listed as a 'new' and I'm sorry to say it is farfrom it i.e. damaged box with bad cover and/or touch ups i.e. black marker, cracks on the box, tape on the edges, etc. I'm very disappointed...not worth the price stated:Item Subtotal:$21.99Shipping & Handling:$2.98Total Before Tax:$24.97 .Regards,Daria E."
2,"One of those ""so bad it's almost good"" movies","I bought this movie because I loved ""Firstborn"" from 1984, which alsostarred Christopher Collett and Corey Haim. A user review from that filmtipped me off. I noticed the reviews of ""Prayer..."" were terrible andso I wasn't expecting much. This movie is absolutely awful. But it israther fun and entertaining. Unfortunately, I am getting too old towaste 85 minutes on junk, but despite an awful script, terrible effectsfor a futuristic sci-fi, and amateurish direction and performances, Ididn't hate it. At least it moved along fast. I can't really recommendthe movie, but if you are a fan of Collett or Haim, I guess you mightget some enjoyment out of this low budget mess."
3,Another solid early 90's flick,"I GIVE THIS MOVIE 3 STARS.THE MOVIE IS GOOD , IT'S LIKE A WHITE VERSION OF A BLACK GANGSTER MOVIE.BUT THE WHITE GUYS ARE A GANG OF ROLLER BLADER'S LIKE 30-80 DEEP IN MEMBERS.I HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE SINCE LIKE 1996 AND I CAN'T REMEMBER IF THERE WAS LAME PARTS OR CORNY ,BUT I'M SURE THERE IS IT'S 1991 FILM MAKING.IF IT COMES OUT ON DVD IT SHOULD BE A 10 DOLLAR MOVIE , ALONG WITH GLEAMING THE CUBE."
2,Save Your $ For Something More Worthwhile!,"Unlike the last reviewer, I have seen this movie -- Back when it was called ""Prayer of the Rollerboys"" -- and it's pretty bad, even for post ""License to Drive"" Corey Haim. Trust me, my husband LOVES this movie, so I've seen it a lot, mainly because I made the mistake of buying it for him one Christmas. This is the type of flick that Joel/Mike and the bots love to hate on MST3K. It's like a particularly bad train wreck, or an episode of Beavis and Butthead -- it's so horrible, but you can't turn away from it. You have to watch it all the way through to its cheesy end. The storyline is absolutely awful, rendering any acting talent in the film quite useless. I was particularly upset to see Patricia Arquette in such a stinker; I usually enjoy her performance, no matter how bad the film. This was an exception.Do yourself a favor -- spend that hard-earned $ on something you'll enjoy, like ""The Lost Boys."" Now that was Corey Haim in his prime!"
3,'Xanadu' it ain't,"""Mad Max"" meets ""I Was a Communist for the FBI"" on Rollerblades in a time capsule of late Cold War-era apocalpytic fears. While the sets don't hold up well a decade later, the script seems surprisingly fresh and Corey Haim's performance is free of child-star smarm as he grapples with the dual loyalties of an informer. Also features a young Patricia Arquette."
4,Lucy Larcom,"Lucy Larcom was a Mill Girl in Lowell, MA. She went west and taught school on the frontier (Illinois). Always interested in poetry, Lucy became a writer later in the 19th Century and good friends with John Greenleaf Whittier. Shirley Marchalonis is a wonderful writer. This book is easy and enjoyable to read."
4,Eh .. it toasts...,"I'm not sure why people are giving this product such bad reviews. It's a toaster, how often are you really using this thing? I've been able to make pop tarts and regular toast quite easily with this machine. Here's a little instruction sheet for anyone not up to snuff on today's modern technology. 1) Plug toaster into wall 2) Insert bread, waffle or pop tart 3) Turn dial to desired browning level 4) Gently push button(s) down 5) Wait 6) Eat. It's really that simple, I kid you not! Don't abuse your toaster, treat it right and you'll have years of happy toast."
1,Toaster review,"A piece of crap. Unless you like standing there and holding the handle down, forget this ""toaster"". One of the controls spins. Even the trash man won't take this piece of crap."
1,Waste of Money,"This is the most horrible toaster I have ever bought. The toast heats unevenly, making one side browner than the other. Not so bad if you dont mind turning your toast half way through the process. The really bad part is the knobs to release the toast broke after less than a week - both sides! Now my knobs are merely there for decoration, as they certainly dont pop the toast up, my toast still is overcooked on one side and not at all on the other - no matter what setting it is at. Needless to say, I will soon be buying myself a new toaster, and likely not this brand."
1,Bagels don't fit :-(,"I bought this toaster about a year ago. It is good for toast and frozen waffles - and only good. The settings are not accurate and not consistant on both sides; put it on 2 for toast and 2 slices will be darker than the other 2... also, the front and back sides are not done evenly. Today, the right side quit popping up. Even on a low setting the side that won't pop up, it just keeps cooking until you smell it burning. Not durable, not very useful, does not cook consistant left side to right side slices."
5,Thumbs up,"As someone who reads historical novels, I give this book an enthusiastic thumbs up. Whether in a vintage movie theater, a victorian home, or at the celebration in New York City's Times Square when WWII ended, it made 20th century America come alive. Also, for an older person like me, the book's large print was a big plus."
2,"""Riding Alone"",all the songs are already previously released","The song ""Riding Along"" is classic Rednex blend of country and folk with uptempo beats. But, this single contains no remixes of ""Riding Alone"". Instead, another great song off 'Sex & Violins' , ""Hittin The Hay"" is the 2nd song and the only remix is one of ""Cotton Eyed Joe"" the Armand Dosey Doe Mix, which if you have the ""Cotton Eyed Joe"" CD Maxi Single you already have. Don't get me wrong, the songs are good but nothing new is contained. ""Riding Alone"" should have been remixed but, unfortunately, the only version on here is the LP Version. I collect Rednex CD Singles and would recommend anyone who wants to own every Rednex single and album should get this. Others who have the album and think you may find something different from this single, you will be disappointed"
1,"Nice exterior, lousy interior",Why would I want to stick velcto strips on my nice Jornada 548? The case doesn't even stay closed. I took one look at it and returned it. No thanks!
1,I expected more.....,"Not roomy enough. I expected to be able to use my Jornada with ease and have room for other papers, etc. It is too expensive, and does nothing to make my 548 more useful."
5,HOW OUR GOVERNMWENT WORKS,"Of course I'm going to brag about it; George A. Boyce was my father. But, I've also become closely involved with Native Americans in my lifetime and I have discovered that the lessons taught by my father in this book are as valid today as they were in the 1930's and 1940's. It's an ugly story about an American government that has an ugly side to it. You need to read it."
5,Music That Rocks,"OHMY ~ MIRA! Wow, ...my ""fandom"" has been forever sealed with this album. Each song moves me to the next...great flow, great sound. It's my new soundtrack to walk to work with and the first thing i put on to make dinner."
3,Nice but don't understand the rave reviews,"This is a nice machine but I don't get the rave reviews some people give this thing. This machine has always seemed like something of a joke to me. I mean do you really NEED a hot cocoa maker??? Well, my 4 year old got to pick out a Christmas present for me this year and she saw this and of course thought is was ""cool"" so my husband let her buy it. The machine works well but to say it makes ""the best cocoa I ever had"" is a bit overstated. Honestly, it tastes just like the cocoa I mix and stir myself; and I don't see that it gets ""frothy"". NOW, one thing I DO like is that it does make the cocoa a very nice temperature; not scalding hot but not lukewarm either. I'm giving this three stars not because it is bad quality but because I just don't think this product is all that!"
2,ok..but doesn't last,"I got this as a gift last Christmas and used about 10 times. It was great, made my cocoa perfectly, the perfect temp, and nice and creamy. We just had our first cold morning and I was so excited I pulled it out and poured my milk and hot cocoa in it. It heated it, but the motor doesn't work any more. I have had this less than a year, and I haven't used it in months. I got maybe 2 months use out of it. I am now looking for something that will hopefully last."
1,I got 3 lemons! Incredible when it worked. But hard to clean!,The hot cocoa this makes is incredible. Its hard to wash. Soak the container or rinse as soon as possible after using. My first one lasted several months. The second one a few months and the third one less than a month. My friend bought one when I got my first one and it still works 3 yrs later and she uses it often. I am very particular about washing and handling it. I dont know what the problem was.
3,Over rated,"PROS: it's quiet. It heats the drink while it's mixing it. Automatically shuts off. Can make a single serving or up to 4 cups. Slightly cumbersome to clean but not difficult.CONS (reasons why it's over rated): not as frothy as described or as some of the reviews indicate. Definitely does NOT make it any creamier than the product already is.This is simply NOT the ""BEST"" hot chocolate maker ever. It's merely convenient because it mixes and heats at the same time. Other than that you will get the same or BETTER results doing it the conventional (multi-step) way and using a blender to whip it.My search continues.... I'm looking for the convenience of this product but with much better end results. If you're OK with just ""regular"" hot chocolate that is made in one easy step you will love this product. If, like me, you're looking forward to ""creamy"" and ""frothy"", you may be as disappointed as I am.This is a RETURN for sure."
4,We really love this,"We are big cocoa fans. Santa brought one this year. It makes great cocoa. Super easy to make. Not too hot. Easy for the kids to measure out and use on teir own.My only complaint is cleaning it. Since its all one piece, you can't submerge in water. The carafe never seems to get really clean, always seems like there are chocolatey spots somewhere. Also, you have to use a paper towel to grip the magnet to pull out. It's an odd thing."
3,Works well,Works well for a 4 cup mixer/heater unit for hot beverages. It does not kick back on to keep the drinks warm like another unit I used to have. I think I just expected a little more. But it is nice for a family brunch to have the machine do the mixing and heating.
5,Awesome hot coco maker,"I have had it for almost three years now and it still works great! My wife and I use it often now that it is getting colder.Easy hot chocolate recipe:One mug of milkto 3 spoons of sugarto 1 spoon of hershey chocolate powder (or equivalent)Hit the on button and wait for a frothy, perfect temperature hot coco.add mini marshmallows after pouring to get the best result."
4,cocolicious,"This machine works really nice! If there is a downfall it's the clean up, because the pitcher part cannot be removed, so you have to be more cautious when cleaning. But other than that it is very quiet and quick."
5,Mr. Coffee Cocomotion,My son is attending college. He is not a coffee drinker but has always liked hot chocolate. Someone at school had one of these machines and he said that it was the best hot chocolate he has ever had. So I surprised him by buying this for him just before he went back to school. He tried it out before he went back and raved about it.
2,This product used to be $29.99 4 years ago,I bought this same product 4 years ago I came on today to buy another one AND it is too pricy 4 years ago I paid $29.99 now it is $66.00 THAT IS INSANE. What is this company thinking seriously I am not buying it. I am going to bed bath and beyond and buying another brand that they have for $30. DO NOT BUY THIS BOYCOTT THIS ITEM
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased one of these last year as a gift for a friend, and when it arrived it looked so nice I was sorry I hadn't purchased another for myself. Imagine my ""happy dance"" when I was lucky enough to find one still sealed in the box 4 months later at a local yard sale for just $2.00.Well I guess I got my $2.00 out of it....it made a total of about 4 cups of hot chocolate before the ball bearings fell out of the little mixer attachment into my hot chocolate and across my kitchen floor to never be seen again.This is basically a blender with a heat setting...the hot chocolate wasn't frothy, just warm and well blended.I my case I can achieve the same results heating water in the microwave and mixing it with a spoon."
5,Awesome Hot Chocolate Maker!!,I received this as a Christmas gift. I love it! It makes perfect hot chocolate in a short amount of time and is always the perfect temperature.It will be on my list of gifts to give for next Christmas!
5,Mr. Coffee Cocomotion,"This is a great kitchen counter appliance for making hot chocolate. It has been around for long time and proven to be a winner. Unfortunately they are becoming more difficult to find so I usually purchase two, one for now, and one for next year. Easy to clean and store and performs well after several warm up's."
5,Great Little Hot Chocolate Machine,"The Cocomotion hot chocolate maker lives up to the Mr. Coffee name. It perfectly heats the milk and blends the chocolate mix. I've always used power mixes in my machine. It might seem that it would be a hassle to clean as it's all one piece, but I found that it's quite easy. Adults and kids both will love using it. Leave it out for the winter and enjoy a cup of hot cocoa when the mood hits you!"
4,Great but............,"As the other reviewers have said this thing does do a great job making hot coco. I do not think it deserves 5 stars. I am hard pressed to give it a 4. This thing is a pain to clean. I am sure there is a reason they made it this way. However, this is the 21st century. They can't figure out a way to make this thing work, affordable and easy to clean!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Defective device twice,"When we first got the hot chocolate maker, we were delighted with it. The froth was fabulous, and it was so easy to use. However, after about 2 months, the little ball bearings inside the magnetic disc began to come out one by one. I called the 1-800 number listed in the manual, and the customer service representative was very helpful. We received another disc to replace the old one. We used the machine again for about 8 months when we had the same problem. As the machine was no longer in warranty, we continued to use the disc after all the ball bearings were out of it. The machine continued to work, and we didn't taste any difference in the hot chocolate. After a few weeks of using it without the ball bearings, we began to hear a terrible noise, so we discontinued using it. I was really disappointed. We did use the machine almost every day, so I don't know if we used it too much or not. The hot chocolate was wonderful; I just wish the machine would have held out longer."
4,Surprise Salvation,"I'm sipping double dark Valrhona cocoa as I compose this.As with another reviewer, this was a kid purchase. And truly, it deserves 5 stars as a must-have for the household with kids. (I use the term ""kids"" loosely.) My teenage boys typically demolished the kitchen making their various cocoa concoctions, and invariably would either scorch it in the pan or worse.This machine is beauty in simplicity. You don't REALLY have to measure anything. Just dump in what looks good and hit the ON button. And clean up is DRAMATICALLY superior to saucepan cocoa, at least as wielded by teenagers.The cocoa blends and heats up beautifully. It froths, too but that is an ingredient issue, IMO. Additionally, the Cocomotion is darn useful for heating milk and cream for tempering, sauces and stuff. I have used it to froth milk for lattes, when I am feeling uncommonly lazy and unpicky. The boys and I will continue to experiment with this thing.I'm done opining -- back to the cocoa."
4,Pretty good for the price,"I got this item for a Christmas present a couple of years ago, and I love it! It heats up the hot chocolate quickly, though if you like your hot chocolate incredibly hot, you may have to run it longer - but it was definitely hot enough for me! I love how easy it is to use.However, there are a few down-sides to the product: the pitcher doesn't detach from the base, so sometimes cleaning it was harder, and you have to unplug the whole thing if you want to take the pitcher to pour drinks somewhere else. Also, the stirring part of the mixer is held in by magnets and after several times of removing it for cleaning, some of the metal balls around the stirrer started falling out (though I didn't notice a change in performance - I'm not sure what the use of those little balls were...)Overall, this is a great and easy product if you want to find something for those who don't like coffee."
3,best for froth lovers,"This maker does mix my lattes well, but they come out very frothy and I can't choose to make them without froth. It takes a while to heat the mixture, but it will make several cups at once."
5,Wonderful!!,"I really like hot chocolate and this makes it really easy to make small or large amounts. The hot chocolate comes out very creamy and frothy, just like in a coffee shop! We have it all time now, which may not be a good for our weight, but the family loves it."
4,Yummy hot chocolate!,"This maker is the best! I bought this for my husband last year for Christmas. It works great. It only takes 10 min. and the tempature is perfect, it never burns your mouth. It also doesn't leave any mix clumps left over (which I HATE!). Its not a big machine either, I leave it on my counter during the cold season. I highly recommed it!"
2,Hard to clean,"My husband and I drink chai tea every morning instead of coffee, and the Cocomotion heats it and froths it up, which makes it very tasty. I haven't been able to find any other machine which is made specifically for tea or hot chocolate, so we use the Cocomotion on a daily basis. It DOES froth well, but I agree with the other reviewer who stated that it is hard to clean. The carafe can't be submerged, and residue collects all around the bottom inside edge, making the machine look dirty. There are little ball bearings in the magnetic stirring mechanism, and they fell out after just a few uses, but we continue to use the machine."
5,Perfect hot chocolate maker,Haven't received this one yet but we have had one for two years and it works perfectly and makes hot chocolate just right every time.
5,best machine ever...next to the coffee maker!,"we use a homemade hot cocoa mix and this thing is so amazing! I love the froth that the machine is able to develop from mixing. My husband and I use it probably 4-5 times a week in the winter! I enjoy being able to hit the start button walk away and do something else. The hot cocoa is piping hot, so if I forget about it (which I sometimes do, it's usually perfectly cooled when I remember! or just hit the start button again! Love the auto shut off. If you're interested in this machine, just buy it you won't regret it! If you're on the fence buy it! You/you're family will love it!"
5,This product is great!!,"I've owned the Cocomotion for 2 years now and it's worked without a hitch. I love it and it's great when guests are over. I've bought the product for others and they, too, have marveled at its simplicity. It makes frothy, hot cocoa in minutes. Try one - you'll wonder how you ever made it without one!!"
5,looove it!,"I only noticed this at wm a few weeks ago, wanted it but figured I could live without it and went home. Believe it or not, I kept thinking about this thing for a week. Then my boss gave me the Godiva Hot Choc gift set (OMG!!! Simply the best.), so I went and bought the Cocomotion on my way home from work that night. What fun!! Now it's me asking the kids if they want Hot Choc! Easy to make, easy to clean and yummy to drink. I understand that Cocomotion may end our relationship by dropping his ball bearing, but until then, I will enjoy every mug of Hot Choc (especially the Godiva Chai)he makes......"
5,$20 at Walmart,I bought this for $20 at Walmart around Christmas time. I'm not sure why it is so expensive on here. It's a GREAT machine. The hot chocolate/cocoa comes out frothy and PERFECT. It's an easy clean up. I will definitely take care of mine for the price I bought it for considering what it is being sold for now. I highly recommend this.
4,C'mon baby do the Coco-motion,I've been reading reviews on amazon and hearing some friends comment on the Cocomotion since last year. (Found one less expensive at Walmart only $20) and I just love it!!!!Makes it so smooth and when you use milk instead of water it is frothy and so yummy! I do use water sometimes and love the taste but sometimes you just want it frothy. KWIM?Wish the cord was longer and wish that the pitcher came off of the mount so that you could immerse it. But other than that it works great!!!Best hot chocolate EVER!Michelle Rae
4,HOT C DRINKER,"I drink a lot of hot chocolate in the winter and found this was a great gift, the only drawback is the cleaning part, the unit doesn't come apartmaking cleanup a little harder, but overall it is a good product."
5,Too bad the product is discontinued,I have one so I sent one to my sister for Christmas. Great fun and great hot chocolate!
5,Loved the book...highly recommend it!,This is a beautiful sepia toned hardback book. Any James Dean fan would love this addition to their collection. There are photos in this book of James Dean that I have not seen before. I enjoyed the journey the author took me on and the final destination...his final resting place in Indiana.
4,An old mystery...,"I was searching through the school library and checked out this book on a whim. I loved it! I love the period of the American Revolution and this was an interesting mystery. Amy Enfield goes to live with her grandmother and great-aunt while her parents relocate to a new city after World War II. She sees a portrait of her ancestor Lucy Griffin, and realizes that they look alike! Amy sees the ghost of Lucy as well as Seth Howes, the rector at the local church and a Loyalist. I don't want to give away the ending, but it's got a lot of twists before everything is resolved. A good read!"
5,Unforgettable,"It's been years since I read this wonderful book and I never forgot it. The images it evokes of the time period are forever in my head. But the title? It was gone. I tried and tried to remember, then it occured to me to do a subject search at the library for American Revolution and Ghosts. Bingo! I might have to buy this book so when I want to read it over again I'll have it.If you're even slightly interested in the time period get this book!"
4,great tunes strong rhythm section deep harp tone impressive,This is some stinging guitar work by mike arciero. I saw the healers live and ordered the cd. lets just say it lives in the cd player.I think chinese japenese is gonna be the Y2K college anthum.These guys are on there way!
5,sensual trees,"As another reviewer said- this is sensual landscapes. This is very much like Chinese ink brush painting, however in 3 dimensions, with sometimes live trees. Stunningly beautiful. This particular book is more of a how to, which concentrates on preparing one, with several photos of the stages of development. Still gorgeous. I may not have all the Penjing books in print, but I'd like to."
4,Vegan Goodness,"This book has really simnple recipes, excellent for beginning vegans. The ingredients can be found virtually anywhere, even New Zealand. I am a [bad] cook, and i even managed to impress my friends! However, there are no pictures so you need to use your imagination with presentation. It also has very useful information about how to minimise vitamin loss through minimun chopping and cooking time.GO VEGAN!"
3,room for improvement,"Yes these styluses (styli?) are perfectly function and more importantly they fit in the HP Jornada cover; however a company that made brightly colors ones would win my dollars. I often write in places that are not well-lit (it's impossible to see the screen in sunlight), but it I drop my stylus in a restaurant or bar or on a train it is hard spot and find. I wish someone would make a bright red, orange or green stylus. Or better yet, how about glow in the dark?"
4,A must have for Jornada 5xx owners,"I had bought these pens for my Jornada 548 - yes, I still have the PDA and it works fine although it is very long in the tooth now :-) Maybe someday I will be able to sell it to a museum :-) Over the years I managed to break / lose the original stylus and one replacement. I now have two left with me and at this rate they will surely last my lifetime :-)"
4,nice,"I have not opened it yet, but loks like just what I had before and loved it! Now with the Holidays over, I will have time for more experimenting."
1,About 2 or 3 years,"Weak. Engine burned out after about 2 years of being used every 3 days or so. It's cheap, you get what you pay for."
1,Don't buy it!!!,"Actually, I just yanked this out of the bottom cupboard to try it again, a gift last year. What a piece of trash! This blender is so awful, the motor is terribly loud and the unit itself leaks when you put liquid in it! Well, what is a blender for? Hello! I had the best Hamilton Beach blender and got rid of it because it was so old and discolored. Guess I'll be tossing this and trying something else! Oster--this is junk! :)"
1,All Osters tend to leak...,"This is my third Oster, and I'm ready to switch to something more durable, practical, and honestly, more aesthetic. At one point or another, the blender will most likely leak, and you'll have extra work cleaning not only the base and blender parts, but also your kitchen counter top. I suggest going for something where the jar (even glass) and the actual blending components are in one piece, there are some great blenders which are easy to clean, yet don't have the leaky jar. Let's face it, this brand is quite economical, the blenders are really not the best quality. If you want something to last at least one year (and many more), invest a few more bucks.Cheers, all the best!"
2,Not a good ice crusher,"I am a big smoothie person, I go through blenders like crazy and this one was no exception. However, I have a serious issue with this blender. SERIOUS issue. Ice. Ice and this blender are like oil and water. I would put ice into a ziplock bag, wrap a towel around the bag, and send my husband with the ice and a hammer into the basement to smash it on the concrete floor. Then, I would take the smashed ice from the badly badgered zip lock bag and put it in the blender to make smoothies. I think the day this blender died was quite possibly the best day of my husband's life; right up there with the birth of our daughter. It would do fine on fruit and ice cream and other delicious drinks that you would make in a blender, but ice for smoothies just did not happen."
2,Can't even blend pie filling,"This product will crush ice but for softer items (namely, pie filling) it doesn't blend or mix or anything. Would NOT recommend."
1,Piece of junk!!!!!,"I have bought over 20 of these blenders over the past 10 years or so to make salad dressing in my restaurant. They all lasted about a year under daily heavy use, which I was really happy with. Oster has now replaced the bottom screw cap of the jar with the flimsiest piece of plastic I have ever seen. I could literally break it into pieces with one hand. I broke the first one within two days. I got another blender locally just to get the bottom cap of the jar and it broke within one hour! I was in a real jam that day because we were open and there were customers flooding in the door, so I bought a third one at the local drug store and it broke too! This product is junk unless they switch back to a stronger cap. I hope they're happy with the 5 cents they save on each blender with the new parts."
3,Blends decently,"Sometimes it doesnt crush all of the ice, there might be a few chunks of ice but its no big deal."
1,Worst blender I have ever owned!,I bought this blender at Target about a year ago. When I used it the first 3 times it smelled like burning plastic. Around the fourth use the bottom plastic piece broke and it leaked everywhere. Also this blender had a hard time even crushing ice. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. Spend a little extra and save yourself the frustration.
1,Junk!,"Bought it from Target yesterday. I plugged it in and spun for 8 seconds and stopped. I am not kidding. Need to return to Target this weekend to return it.I knew it was really cheap but thought it would be good at least for the summer. I expected it might only last a few months, not 8 seconds.A cheap price is never a bargain if the item doesn't work."
1,Dead Blender,"I used this blender exactly TWICE. The third time it failed to start. I tried different outlets, looked for a reset button, etc. No go. Dead blender."
2,Mozy Mixer,Turns on.Won`t turn off!What can I say?They just don`t make things like they used to.How this one passed QC?I`ll never know.
2,Didn't last long.,"This blender did its job for a few months, but then the motor burned out while making a milkshake. I won't be buying this model again."
4,Very good for the price you are paying,This item is very good for the price you are paying It is multipurpose blender and it will lost for longer. I had same one earlier and used for 6 yrs without any issues. So I bought same one again. I really recommend this for the people over expensive other blender.
1,Bad motor.,"I used this blender one time to make a shake. I put milk, protein powder and peanut butter in the jar and set it to liquify. It ran for about 10 seconds then shut off on its own. It never worked after that."
1,Poorly constructed and doesn't work wel,"This blender is very light, and travels all over the counter while running. You have to hold it still! The blades are designed for ice-crushing only, and don't do a good job on thick sauces. The motor is also very noisy and overheats quickly."
2,"Cheap, weak blender","I just bought this blender last week and have made about 5 smoothies with it. For smoothies, I use frozen fruit, protein powder and rice milk. I let the frozen fruit sit in the rice milk for 5 minutes to start thawing out the fruit. Still, this POS blender cannot chop the fruit. The motor revs and revs and you can smell the little motor toiling away. Only the fruit at the very very bottom gets blended. I have to stop and stir and blend again. I wonder how long this motor will last as it strain to the verge of overheating.I thought that $300 for a high quality blender was too much. I thought that if this one wore out and broke after a year, I would just buy another. That was a good theory provided that the blender could easily make a smoothie. I guess this would be good for soups but I am not even going to go there. I am going to return this ASAP.If you do a lot of cooking or expect to blend ice or frozen fruit, keep looking for another blender. Trust me."
1,Made as cheaply as possible,Bought this blender new. Used it about 12 times before the motor burned up. I know its an inexpensive blender but it should have beengood for at least a couple of hundred runs. Motor probably made in China using the cheapest pot metal for motor casing and hair thickcopper wiring for binding and brushes. Good as a very cheap (Suzie Homemaker) blender if you are in a pinch and need a throw away unit orif you need a quick gift to give somebody you hardly know and don't want to look like a cheapskate.
2,you get what you pay for...i guess,"When it comes to my kitchen, I always make sure to invest in high quality appliances that will do their job and last a long time. The purchase of this blender, however, is an exception. The blender is plastic and not glass. Originally I thought that it did not matter, but the plastic quickly gets hazy. And by quickly I mean after using it twice. The blender does not lock onto the base, but rather sits there which is quite annoying. I also have a little bit of problem with leakage from the bottom which could be entirely my fault.As a blender, it functions well. But if I could go back in time and buy a slightly pricier blender, I would."
4,Oster 6640 Blender,"I had the same model for 20 years. Just last month it started to leak oil and wasn't chopping or mixing as well as it should. After 20 years it needed a rest so I went looking for a similar blender. I was pleased to find the same model is still being made, however now it is much lighter and easier to use. The jar is plastic now, the older one was a very heavy glass. I do prefer glass. This works very well. My only complaint is that when I use the chop, grind, whip and grate modes the darn thing moves and the lid pops up. I have to hold it down and still. Annoying, but not too bothersome considering how well it works for the price."
1,Sandbags couldn't stop this leak,"Let me start off by saying that I placed the rubber ring in the correct position. First two blends for smoothies - leakage. I thought, well, maybe it can't handle juice and frozen fruit for some reason. So I tested it with just WATER. Leakage. Unbelievable.So on my third blend, I placed frozen fruit in by itself, and alternated between low and high Grate / Easy Clean. I basically babied the friggin' blender. I only went to Pulse a few short times. I then slowly poured the juice in a little bit at a time while I used a wooden stick to stir. Bottom line: No leakage, but it took way too much time and effort to keep it from leaking.Not a ""Good Buy""."
1,Junk,"I am on my second Oster. It actually does a very decent job, except that it is next to impossible to use for any task more demanding than whipping a single milkshake. The first one I bought burned out after a month of use and was replaced. I am more careful with this one meaning I don't run it for more than 10 seconds, and stop the moment it starts smelling like burnt plastic, which arrives exactly then, at 10 seconds. The bottom plastic piece has cracked and is held together by epoxy. I certainly will not buy another Oster blender no matter how cheap and well-reviewed it is."
4,Cookie Cutters,"I bought these cutters to use with my 2 year old. He loves to help in the kitchen. They're not the best cutters, for obvious reasons (they're plastic), but they work just fine for cookies & pie crusts. Just be sure to dip them in flour before each cut, & use your finger to gently push the dough out when needed.I've seperated the cutters into catagories & store in ziploc bags in a box--not the box they came in, because I can't get them all in the original box!Would recommend for use with kids. A decent buy for the price."
3,I must be color-blind,"Reading all the pre-hype publicity about the book,especially about an era & music that has defined who I am, was, whatever...But again reading about what this book included re. ""filled with color picture's"". Colored pictures! They are very few & far between, one has to hunt to find even a few.I am not taking away one single shot, they're a great testament that to me are timeless. Especially heady are the quote's from members of Country Joe & the Fish.I will treasure these images untill my rocking-chair day's, but for heaven's sake, don't publicize a book with the declaimer,""filled with color photographs""."
5,The Best Documentation of Monterey Pop to Date,"Elaine Mayes really brings the majesty and the momentous occasion that was the first ever rock music festival and soical happening, The Monterey Pop Festival, to the reader in photographs and in words. The book is beautifully designed and unfolds in a way that the reader can either perfectly recount those days in June of 1967 perfectly or for the novice, it is an accurate, historical journal.I gave this book to a friend of mine that had attended Monterey Pop and she cried as she recalled the days of peace, love and rock & roll."
5,Top Soldier,"I had previously watched this movie when it was on television. Of course, that was some years ago. I have always been a sucker for a happy ending.I believe the movie was controversial when it was made because segregation was prevelant back then.Other than that, I always liked Jeffrey Hunter. He plays a lawyer in the Army defending a soldier accused of violating and killing the daughter of the commander of the Army post."
3,Unusual B Western from John Ford,Length:: 4:34 MinsAny John Ford western has to be held to the highest standards of movie making.
4,Treasure of Childhood,"Musicaly fairy tales. What more could a kid ask for. One of the classic and coveted Cannon Movie Tales series, although admitedly not one of their best (The Frog Prince and Sleeping Beauty are arguably better), still a member of something amazing. A bit of a twist on the old tale that succedes in bringing the characters to life, as many revisions of fairy tales often try but fall short of doing. Throw in a dash of sweet, catchy tunes that kids likely will be humming in those small quiet moments, even 10 years from now, when they've techinically ""outgrown"" childhood loves. As a child this movie was one of my most treasured possesion, and still holds a deep and beautiful place in my heart. For a 5-12 year old kid, especially one that likes fairy tales, this is an unmissable, everlasting treasure. Better even than the fairie tale theatre creations. I mean it."
3,A Fairy Tale with a Good Song.,"Worth watching if only for the one song ""One Little Name"" sung by Amy Irving. All the songs are pleasant within this musical. Enjoyable.A bragging miller gets his daughter in a jam. She must spin straw into gold for a greedy king. She makes a bargain with a ""bad"" elf. When she becomes princess, she must guess the elf's name or give him her baby.""Hansel and Gretel"" by the same studio is good too, with a witch with a lot of personality, probably doing a lot of ad-libbing.I suggest how they could have written a better script under the ""comment button"" below."
3,It's ok,"I bought this movie because It was from my childhood, but this is not the best movie nor acting abilities."
1,not so great,"this is an old video, grainy visuals, very ugly and scary troll for the kids and the music is terrible. I would get the book for the kids since they wont want to sit thru this, and neither will you."
3,Mmmmm puede ser,La verdad si la han visto de niños recuerdenla como era ya q ahora no van sentirse tan emocionados al verla....en fin esta buena para sus hijos.
2,Why i didnt wnjoy this game,it was a very boring game im glad i bought it for my gf =P maybe someone wlse would enjoy this game though
1,Waste of Money,"I bought this game thinking that it would be similar to most other Cabelas games.Boy was I wrong.This game totally blows and is almost as disappointing as Dangerous Hunts 2.Take my advice,buy something other than this game.If you buy it,you'll be sorry!!"
1,Poor Quality,The music stand is very cheaply made. The stand broke the first time it was setup. I would not recommend this stand at all. Save your money a pay a little more for better quality.
5,Very good value,Fits the bill perfectly as a light duty music stand. Very well made and well thought out. Nice case too. Really atractive price.
2,Cheaply made.,Spend a little more money and get a good stand. This one is cheaply made and will not stand up to any but very light use.
2,flimsy,"Most of the stand is an ok design with extentions and book clips and such. However, the neck that attaches into the stand is flattened tubing (poor design) and is very easily bent especially considering the long lever arm of the book holder that is tack welded to it. In all, it will function fine as long as it is babied - it won't take any abuse. Looking back, I would have been better off buying the stand at a store where I could view the construction and ensure a robust design. ... with a guarantee."
1,Cheap Stand - Bad quality,Very soon when I bought this stand the base got loose and it falls all the time. I tried to repaired several times by pressing it but it doesn't work. I will pay a bit more for a better stand in the future.
1,DO NOT buy this stand,"I got this product because of the other good reviews and it was cheap. Now I regret my decision. On the outside it looks fine, but the inside metal is all rusted making it extremely difficult to raise or lower the stand. The metal supports at the bottom came already bent also. If you want to buy a stand that will last a long time and are going to use it frequently, then do NOT buy this stand. Pay a little extra money for the other higher quality wire music stands."
5,Great stand for on the go!,"Super stand for music camps and anytime you are on the go- well made, folds easily, great price- couldn't be happier!"
1,DOA,"The challenge with inexpensive cables is that the seller doesn't care about their quality because they work on volume. I was looking for an extra long cable for my printer and thought this was the solution. Never worked. If you are lucky enough to get one that works, good for you."
2,passable entertainment,"This movie is fun, but very very predictable. It also gets bonus points fro the young Teri Hatcher before she became big. The initial kidnapper and commandant of the trio, Kim, played by Lara Harris, steals the show."
3,A fine B-movie for a lonely saturdaynight.,"I liked the movie although it is kinda cheap. The acting wasn't top notch, but was good enough for that lone saturdaynight. It's comical and totally not offensive. I therefore question the ""R"" rating, maybe because of the subtle humor involved hich might be mistaken for some SM, which it's not. Look out for the Ex-Karatekid and Lois lane of The new adventures of Superman. I loved the unknown actress Lara Harris, who actually started the ""kidnapping"" of the so much hated macho."
1,Civil War Concept Album : A disaster!!!,"This album does not really give you a snap shot of the forthcoming musical. I was disppointed when I heard the album. I don't understand why they call this Nashville Session, a ""supposedly"" country music concept album of Civil War, yet they have Linda Eder and some singers, who were not a country music singer. This album is just a cheesy water down version of another Concept Album of Civil War (2-dics)""The Complete Music of Civil War"". Definitely Frank Wildhorn is unreputable the king of concept album. I think he'd better off composing pop music for pop stars like Celine Dion and Barbara Streisand, rather than being on Broadway......"
2,"Not exactly what I wanted, but exactly as advertised.","I was looking for a specific piece of music. It was included on this CD but was not recorded as I preferred---not the fault of the seller, but mine. I wish there were a way to preview music."
3,For the Glory,"I saw this musical in June 2010 at the Flat Rock Playhouse in Flat Rock, NC. The musical I saw was titled For the Glory, a Civil War musical. It was sensational. I bought this CD immediately afterward so that I could continue to enjoy some of the greatest stage songs I have ever heard. But I was disappointed in the CD as it did not include much of the music I heard. If someone has not experienced the version I saw, this CD is enjoyable. But if one has seen the For the Glory version of the play the listener will be disappointed."
3,Not a Broadway Cast Album,"I disagree that all of the songs on this recording sound the same. Compare ""Virginia"" to ""River Jordan"" to ""Freedom's Child."" Someone must have not listened to the entire recording.I am only disappointed that there is no original Broadway Cast Recording. I saw the last performance of this show in NYC and my students and I were blown away. It is the only show I have ever seen that received a standing ovation during the middle of Act I.Still, I do use this cd as an example in my musical theatre class to show how different styles of music can represent the times and variety of Broadway shows."
4,See the Show,"After seeing the show I had to immediately run out and buy the CD. It's good, but live theatre will always prevail. For a generation who hasn't had to live through a war on home soil, this music gives heart to history books and fleshes out the black and white pages of your tattered high school text on the Civil War. Listen to ""For the Glory"" and remember the cost of freedom."
2,One-sided,None of these songs are from the actual Civil War period. Only one is from the point of view of a slave. Most are about Rebel forces and families. Linda Eder's song is the only truly beautiful one.
5,Brilliant record that you must own.,"This really is an amazing record. Willie's original is a real classic record. For somebody to decide to cover it in it's entirety is just a brilliant idea to begin with. To then be able to go in and make an album your own.. make a concept your own.. is just a tribute to how good Carla and these musicians truly are.It's a nice mixture of country & western, jazz, and weirdness. Buy this record right now."
5,A Very Preachable Book,"Fans of William Willimon will not be disappointed with this book. It does a great job of showing the church for what it is, warts and all. As you walk through the pages you find that the church really is called to be a place that is different from the world. You will find that the church must not change to keep up with its surrounding world, rather it must invite the world to come in and be changed. There are real life stories in this book that illustrate the church at its very best and they are very preachable. This book is a must have for resident theologians (pastors) of every denomination. I would trade every book in my library for this one."
5,Rosie's Family: An Adoption Story,"I used this book in my therapy sessions with those patients, who are in homes where they will be adopted. The book was an excellent tool to share with the patients and their caretakers. I also shared the book with my colleagues.I see the book as a valuable tool in helping to explain what adoption is and means."
4,"Good, but not Great","A well diversified selection. It's between pop and traditional. Most of them are not for dancing. Some of the songs are very catchy at the first time, but others take couple of times to get in to the rhythm. Good, but not great."
3,Will it ever be available?,"I have been waiting to buy one of these for over a year. I recently saw the unit at a trade show, buy the reps. were clueless as to when it will be available, or what the delay has been. The unit was much smaller and of cheaper construction (a lot of plastic) than I had imagined from the picture. Some of the buttons are a bit ""gimmicy"", if that is a word. They have the right idea, but it looks like there is much room for improvement. =I will probably still buy one if they ever actually sell them. Until then, I will continue to use the Sonic Box IM tuner, which does a respectable job of remote tuning, but requires the pc to stay on."
3,"""We Used to Ride 'em"" is perfect","""We Used to Ride 'em"" is the only track that impressed me on this album. But what a great track it is! If anything, give that one a listen."
5,track listing,"1. carl craig - at les (russ gabriel rework)2. bjorne torske - don't electric shock me3. russ gabriel - finally, it's the time (part 2)4. stasis - express5. aubrey - blue lick6. 4th wave vs synchrojack - rudder7. max brennan - sirius at the pier8. dan curtain/mike filly - the longest night9. the invisibles - estamos perdidos10. idiot savant - rudimental sketch11. fusion - cube of the blues (ian o'brien rework)"
5,SPECTACULAR!! 2 thumbs up!!!!,"Jenny McCarthy is stunning as always. While a small portion of the scenes are slightly mundane, the overall video is as exciting, tasteful and professionally done as Playboys reputation infers. Also, Shannon Fogarty's Playboy special is worthy of checking out. Jenny McCarthy's video special on a scale of 1 to 10 is an 11!!!!"
4,good video,"this video was delivered as promised.this is a good video. shows jenny in her playboy years. seems to have good imaging. it is not for everyone, but if you like to see pretty lady in her best, then this is a good pix for those that like the MTV days, will have something to remember. on this one, so what if I am drunk? drunk or sober, this video looks good to me. if you are offended by nudity, don't buy it. jenny looks good to me. beuty is in the eye of the beholder, I know. looks good to me. I still fail to understand what being drunk or sober would have to do with this. I know what I see. to the others, it is in the eye of the beholder."
2,Good for mixing liquids only,I'm very sorry to say that this machine has very little power. I believe the first and only thing I mixed in it was brownies. The machine struggled through that! My hand mixer is much more powerful. The glass bowl is nice which is why I gave it 2 stars rather than one. I really wish I had bought the Pink Kitchen Aide that I had been looking at.
3,Surprised by size,"A student at our school brought a copy of this book to show his class and we wanted to purchase a copy for our library. I never thought to look for dimensions of the book, but this copy is much smaller than the one we had first seen and we would have preferred a larger format to be reading in a classroom setting."
5,"Dated, daring, wonderful","Get past the dated image of gender roles, and you see the book revealed for what it is: touching and gentle. It shows the fulfillment of a dream in spite of expectations, a mother rabbit with a chance at greatness, as one of the (several) Easter bunnies who delivers eggs around the world. I enjoyed as a child, I love it as an adult."
2,BAD Digital Copy,"I Love this book, but this digital copy is poor. First they scan the pages, then retype the text under the text. This book deserves more attention. I love this book so much that when I had children I got a new copy for them. When I got my fire I wanted a copy for it. I was disappointed."
5,Country bunny & the little gold shoes,Lovely book. Remember it from my childhood when my mom would read it to me. I recommend it for anyone.
3,The Country Bunny and the Little Gold Shoes.,"According to this book, there isn't just one Easter Bunny, but five. When one of them gets too old, then a new one is chose by the grandfather bunny. A poor country bunny named Cottontail wants to be an Easter Bunny. She eventually gets older and has many children. She teaches her children to take care of the house. Then word comes around that one of the Easter bunnies needs to be replaced, so all the bunnys go to the Easter Egg palace to see who can become the next Easter Bunny. Cottontail turns out to be the wisest, swiftest, and kindest bunny. She goes to deliver an egg to a sick boy over many mountains. She goes up the last one, but falls. Then the Grandfather Bunny gives her a special pair of golden shoes that allow her to be able to jump super high and fast, so she can get the egg deliverede. This book is well-written, but I don't think the illustrations are very good. It is written by Du Bose Heyward, and illustrated by Marjorie Hack."
1,mis-marked product`,"When i recieved the product in the mail, I noticed that it was exactly &"" like the description called out. Then when i investigated the prduct even more i realized that it wasn't even usb powered, it was just a typical 110 plug. I should have returned it but the shipping was almost what i payed for the lamp."
4,Relaxing,"The item was shipped very quickly and so far has lasted a log longer than one I purchased from another company. The cord is nice and log, almost too long but it allows you to place it anywheres on your desk."
4,Howatch never Disappoints,"The only reason I gave this book 4 stars is because I feel Howatch's ""Glamorous Powers"" and ""Glittering Images"" are better. This book is the sequel to ""The Rich are Different"". My major question after finishing both is: What caused Cornelius to be so self-deluded and evil? He is totally consumed with his power and the ""rightness"" of his actions. In ""The Rich are Different,"" Howatch seems to allude to his childhood isolation brought on by his asthma. However this explantion just doesn't seem to be enough to explain how he could be so warped at such an early age. Perhaps we are to assume that explanations cannot always be found to fully explain a human character so twisted. I will continue to read Howatch. The stories are complex and not easily predictable. I recommend her works to all."
2,Good only if using with Motorola phone,"Inconvinient. It works okay with Motorola phone. But when I switched over to LG Chocolate, the quality of hearing plummeted. Same with Motorola Bluetooth H850."
2,Save money & buy @ supermarket!,"Wish I paid attention..I ordered this & it was shipping from "" It took three weeks for delivery even though it said it was already shipped & estimated delivery was 9 days. Well it took 21 days! Shipping & Handling price was ridiculous as well. Product was ok but could have gotten anywhere else without the hassel. Would not recommend ordering from Polsteins HomeandBeyond to anyone! My mistake!"
3,Mr. Coffee does it again.,"I got these JR100 filters for my Brother & Sister inlaws Homewarming gift.I know they are dependable because I have used the brand off and on. If I weren't using a cone type filter currently, I would be going with the Mr. Coffee type!"
2,"Product fine, too expensive to ship","Bought coffee maker as a gift and bought filters along with but when I checked out realized the (additional) shipping was over six dollars as they were shipped from TruValue (not Amazon, which I love to shop) and could only cancel order thru them. So, I went ahead and paid for the shipping but had I known I'd bought the filters at the grocery and mailed them from the post office the save a few bucks. I guess I paid for the convenience but usually am more frugal than that."
3,A bit far fetched,"Many of the drawings of the creatures look like something out of H.P. Lovecraft. Speculation on what life on this planet will look like in the far future is kind of interesting, but many of the drawings looked silly to me...and the names -- ""sharkopath?"" ... ""squibbon?""Also what do Dougal Dixon and John Adams have to do with this book? I could not find them credited anywhere in the text or the verso page?"
1,CHEAP CHROME - Not a Universal Fit,"I also ordered this based on the description of ""stainless steel"" and was disappointed to receive a chrome-plated product. Worse yet, it doesn't even fit the Char-Broil Universal Rotisserie attachment I have for my grill."
1,Not as Advertised!,This basket is NOT stainless steel as advertised. It is merely chrome plated. I returned it immediately and have been dinged for return shipping costs and other miscellaneous fees as the 'error was not our fault'. Amazon is continuing to advertise this item as something it is not despite being alerted to the discrepancy by other consumers. I believe that qualifies this error as being entirely their fault. This is not the level of customer service I have come to expect and rely upon in my dealings with Amazon.
1,I'll give 5 Negative stars,"This product doesn't deserve any star. I even contact the company, but there is no return customer service that you would think they will like to taken care of consumers feedback.I ended up wrap the bags with the ties, so the bag will stay flat. It's too much work and waste money!"
1,These just don't work,"I have tried Spave Bags twice, because I thought the first time it was my error. It wasn't. They just don't work. I've tried all the tips, I've done everything. They will not hold a seal. They rip. They're a piece of expensive crap. You're better off getting hard plastic bins that seal and sealing them with duct tape if you're afraid of moisture. Don't waste your money."
1,Lousy Product!,"I agree - how do they get away with selling this product to the public??? I purhcased them from Bed, Bath & Beyond and not ONE of them didn't leak so when all is said and done, I could have used trash bags to store my items. Are you then supposed to UNPACK everything and bring the bags back? DON'T BUY SPACE BAGS!! THEY SIMPLY DON'T WORK!"
1,tried and tried,"I bought a set of bags to store things during upcoming move. Went through the sealing/vacuuming process 3 or 4 times and the bags always reinflated. Gave up and took them back to store for refund. Guess some folks have had better luck, but I followed the instructions carefully each time."
1,warning - this thing leaks!,"a horrible product - cheaply made, and it leaks nonstop! I don't know how they get away with making such a shoddy product."
