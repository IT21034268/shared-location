4,Very Satisfactory and Would Buy Again,"After about 18 months of being used 2-3 times a day, this grinder is still going strong and has already lasted longer than any other grinder previously owned. It is powerful and grinds fast, the fill marks inside the steel bowl are really handy, and being able to toss the bowl and cover in the dishwasher is a plus. The design of the push down cover causes some ground coffee to spill on the counter everytime it is removed. If not for that, I would have rated it 5 stars."
3,"Looks great, works soso","My trusty melitta grinder died after 10 years of service. Not bad for a 10-dollar grinder. This one sits smugly on my counter matching my Kitchenaid blender, bur performance-wise I cannot rate it highly. It's noisier than the Melitta and has trouble producing an even grind. On a slightly positive note, it could be used both as a coffee mill and as a spice mill since the cup is washable."
1,Horrible,"Pretty much what everyone else who gave it a 1 star review said: Overheats, smokes, smells horrible (burning synthetic oil smell) doesn't grind nearly as well as my Melita (which was 1/2 the price) motor is underpowered, no thermal override, impossible to get a fine grind, just a dreadful product. What ever happened to Kitchen Aid quality? Makes me very wary about their other appliances."
3,Coffee grounds everywhere,"After buying the infamous KitchenAid stand mixer, I decided to continue adding more KitchenAid products to my collection. However, I should've skipped this coffee grinder. Yes, it looks sleek, Yes, it's powerful, BUT the design is poor. See the plastic top? You push that straight down over the metal grinding chamber to activate the grinder. Unfortunately, coffee grounds fly into the space between the metal chamber and the plastic cover. The minute you take off the cover, viola'! Coffee grounds all over the counter top. I'm surprised that KitchenAid let this one slip by considering the quality that is their claim to fame. I'd give it a mid-range rating."
1,MAJOR DESIGN FLAW,"The lid has been designed with a major flaw such that a small ground of coffee stuck in a lid crevice stops the grinder from operating. You must use a tooth pick or other tool to clean out the groove after every grinding. Also after 2 uses, the motor smoked and burnt out. It is a real ""lemon."""
4,Terrific and sturdy !,"We received this as a wedding gift, we use it everyday now for 5 months. It has a sturdy plastic top which does not feel cheap or flimsy like some others...I like the way the top fits and unlike the other reviewers - we see no mess and no un-ground beans...you have to use some sense, as with all appliances, and realize what its limitations are...so do not try to grind the whole bag of beans at once :} I will buy it again if it dies and buy it as a gift for friends."
2,un- kitchen aid,"Got this today and reviewer who said ""coffee grinds all over counter "" is correct. Even under the first line for fill guidelines; less than 4 cups; I had grinds on the counter and on the side of the unit. Also, removable bowl is not very easy to remove; and requires tweaking to re seat. Very poor design; sorry kitchen aid; don't want to clean my counter and grinder every time I use it. This unit going back."
2,Poorly designed,"I own a number of KitchenAid appliances, and have been happy with all except this one. The unit is noisy, to begin with. More importantly, it makes a mess because of the way the cover fits over the outside of the unit (rather than recessed as in some better designed models). Inevitably ground coffee ends up on the counter. Get the Krups grinder instead--it's smaller, quieter, and cleaner."
3,Not always an even grind,"I read the reviews prior to my purchase, so I was not completely surprised to find that this grinder does not always perform the way it should. The main purpose for my purchase was to grind spices and nuts but not coffee too much.On the positive:a) It is relatively quietb) You can take the unit apart to wash it - big plusc) Powerful enough for any coffee bean or spiceOn the negative:a) It can scatter crumbs all over your counter if you over OR under fill the unit.b) Does not grind the coffee, peanuts, spice or anything else too evenly.c) If you try and grind everything evenly, you may end up with a fine powder with a few whole beans still untouched.Not a bad grinder, just not a 4 or 5 star grinder."
4,Good but Krups is better and cheaper,"I recently bought this grinder to replace the Krups Fast Touch grinder that I took up to the office. I'm partial to KitchenAid products and all the major appliances in my kitchen are that brand. While this coffee grinder is solid, well-made and comes apart for easy cleaning, it does not grind beans as evenly and consistently as the Krups. It also is a little messy, even when you follow the directions and don't pulse. Even the Krups can let a few grounds get on the counter, but it does a better job overall and is about ten dollars cheaper."
5,"very good quality,worthy for price too.",very good in quality and price is less too....you will get powder like coffee after it fully grinded...
3,KitchenAid Grinder,"I wish this grinder was designed like my old favorite vintage Kitchenaid grinder, with the hopper above to hold the beans, and the spout below to dispense just the ground amount needed. . . I do not like to have to add beans each time and then turn the whole grinder upside down and remove the lid to get the ground coffee out--WAY TOO MANY STEPS first thing in the morning--or any time! But it grinds well, and I will keep this grinder for the occasional decaf batch after dinner, so I don't have to empty out the other grinder for decaf beans."
2,Grinds go everywhere,"At first I thought, wow, this grinder looks so cool, how could I go wrong? Well, it turns out that coffee grinds accumulate at the top of the lid and spill out onto the counter when the top is lifted. I am sick of cleaning my countertops every time I want a cup of Joe. It also doesn't play region 2 DVDs. See kitchenaid red toaster."
3,Worked 'okay' but I wasn't using it for coffee though,"Used this grinder to past some beaver castor. I woudl have thought for sure that a coffee gridner could handle this. Just a mini blender pretty much. Well, after not using it long, it started to smoke. Now, it still works, and I continued, but after about 20 seconds of being turned on it starts to smoke. And it only did ""okay"" on turing my concoction to a paste (I added glycerine to make it easier). So, it might work for coffeee, but its not really that good at making trapping lures."
1,"A disappointment, lose whole beans","This disappointing grinder leaves dozens of whole beans untouched. This morning, when I ground coffee for my 4-cup French press, I lost a tablespoon of whole beans--from PEET's Coffee. For people who treasure their coffee beans (not to mention the people who picked them) this is a waste. My brother tells me to shake the thing as it is grinding, but it still misses this much. Go with the Capresso instead. I expected more from Kitchen Aid. ."
5,coffee grinder,very good disign / workin' fast to dust-powder consistent or whatever you want / you coffeelover? you need it/
4,"Good, but...","Like many of the other reviewers noted, this thing does make a mess. I bought this for grinding spices and when griding cinnamon, I ended up with cinnamon all over the place. That being said, it is a very good grinder. Very powerful and a nice big stainless basket. Also, unlike many grinders, you can remove and wash (in the dishwasher even) the basket/blade assembly. Just one more thing that I've noted is that this grinder is somewhat larger than my Krups grinder that I use for coffee, and consequently, the blade sits higher off the bottom of the basket. When trying to grind a small amount of spices (and I'd imagine coffee beans), it had some problem grinding everything, just because the blade didn't hit it. With larger amounts of materials, it works like a charm, however.Overall, great, but messy, and not so good for small quantities."
3,"Great for coffee, ok for spices","As alomst everyone has noted, the grinder works really well, but it does make a mess. I thought it was just me. Some thought it was messy because of the large amount of coffee they were grinding. I grind spices for a recipe at a time, so the volume has nothing to do with it.Now that I am also using it for coffee, I've noticed that it doesn't make a mess when grinding coffee. I ground cinnamon last week at it was back to it's old tricks. Lesson learned -- great for coffee, ok for spices.I bought this because I own almost every other counter top appliance KA makes and I love them. This is the only one I will give less than four stars to. However, I'll gladly deal with the mess it makes for the ability to put it in the dishwasher."
3,Not sure why it's so popular,"Maybe it's because I use this for spices as well as coffee.But no matter what you grind it's a MESS. Stuff can't help but slide down the sides of the top. Coffee grinds all over your countertop GUARANTEED. No way to get the coffee super fine, either without grinding them longer than they suggest. Kitchenaid must know about this defected top."
2,The Mess Is Not Worth It,"Grinds coffee beans beautifully. But the mess it makes is not worth it ... especially given the price. When you take the cover off after grinding, chaff from the beans flies everywhere and sticks to the Bowl and Base due to static. I learned to remove the cover over the sink and had to wipe down all the parts each time I used it. Not worth the aggravation, I kissed good-bye my $29.99+ and tossed it."
1,Dissapointed,"I was truly dissappointed with this grinder. Grounds are ALWAYS getting packed down in teh area under the blade and have to be scraped out every day. The basin is hard to remove from the base. Easy to clean and looks nice on the counter, but a pain to use."
4,Nice lather,"Definitely lathers well. Feels great on skin. This shaving cream is unscented. That is how I wanted my cream but if you are a person who likes strong scents, this cream may not be for you. So far this is the best shaving cream I have used. I have very sensitive skin and this cream works out fine for me."
5,One Year Later...,"I purchased this on August 6, 2010 (according to the yellow bar at the top of this page, courtesy of Amazon) and am coming back today to purchase the product again. Yes, the one tub lasted me just over a year. The high upfront price is offset by the fact that it will last you a very long time. The cream itself is great. I started DE wet shaving a year ago and tried out a few different products in different price ranges. This is easily my favorite. It lathers quickly and you get a very creamy end product with little work. You'll want to use a shave brush/mug combination to get the best possible shave with this cream. It's billed as ""unscented"" but there is a lavender scent that is not overpowering; just keep in mind that this is not void of all scent. I won't rewrite what other reviewers have said but I plan to use this cream for another year."
5,Very nice...,"I purchased this shaving cream due to the comments left by others.I am comparing this to ""Art of Shaving"" Non Scented shaving cream, ""Art of Shaving"" Sandle Wood disk shaving cream.I use a shaving brush and a Merkur razor with Light Feather Blades.I was very impressed with the lather, thick and moist. In fact very little is needed for ""Method"" shaving using three applications in one morning shave.Cleans off the brush easy.Moisturizes my face all day and very comfortable.I would definitely compare this to the Art of Shaving creams, in fact I think it is a bit better."
4,The wife approves!,"It's not totally scent free, but what's there is very mild and pleasant. The feel top notch, luxurious even. This is great stuff to use for wet shaving with a brush & safety razor. Although a tad pricey a little goes a long way -- especially when using a brush to lather up."
5,Smooth Shaving Cream,I bought this for my sensitive skin and it shaves very very smoothly! It also lasted me about 6 months. Best shaving cream I have ever tried.
5,Grady Baby (Decatur Ga),Man i bought this album 5 times in the past 8 years and it stills get more bump in my ride before any of this other BS thats out right now. Tommy Wright holds it down for the south!
1,UnderEducated Gibberish,"This fool, can barely talk, let alone rap. Country fool, biting Bone Thugs style, lil chat sound sooo country its funny, People who actually have common sense, would know that Bone thugs, would rip thses carbon copy imposter fags in half,...ya dig?This album probably didnt even sell 1,000 copies.....so what up NowE.1999 is where ya find me, slanging me llelo BABY!!!Chino, is te city where I come from so RUN Runnnnnn.Peace"
1,what is this....,"this is hands-down the worst cd i have ever bought. listen to tuggish ruggish bustaz and you'll see why you shouldnt waste your money. if u want some real underground rap, check out baby d. BTNH 4EVA."
1,what is this....,this is hands-down the worst cd i have ever bought. listen to tuggish ruggish bustaz and you'll see why you shouldnt waste your money. BTNH 4EVA.
3,"Over-rated, and still Unknown",This cd is alright if you like to hear someone dis a person then turn around and take their style. The ablum is lucky to have been blessed by M.M.M. King Playa Fly.It isn't a waste of money if you get it used/
1,Wrong item depicted,"Although it has the same name (""Encore of Golden Hits""), the CD described is not the same as the one you'll end up with. This happened to me and I had to return it. The CD I received was a later recording with a totally different song line-up than in the item's description. Buyer beware."
4,ah audio cd review,"all songs as original recordings on vinyl LP accept one key song (Twilight Time) missing, substituted, left out of this copy of CD."
1,Watch what you use it on,"Do not use on any gun you care about. Very disappointed with the results as after about 20 rounds in my shotgun, extreme wear patterns started to emerge. Went back to regular oil and no further problems. Stay away from dry lubes."
3,Lacemaking in English,"Fro many years this book was the only book on Lacemaking available in English and we are so grateful for it. But almost all the English language books available today use a different method from this one, and it would be confusing to start with this method and then have to change when buying any other English book. It might be better to start with the method you will continue with.But if you have a teacher from Belgium this would be the method she will use.(as opposed to an American or English teacher)"
3,Its a Mini Magazine,"You cant tell from the photos but this magazine is miniature- about the size of a normal magazine folded in half. I bought it as a gift for someone and they havent complained, but keep in mind you are not paying for a traditional magazine."
2,Read the fine print.,"I had to send my receiver into DirectV for service after only 3 months. The first refirbished one they sent back also failed. The second worked but they charged me $1000 because they thought I didn't return one of the receivers. It took an hour on the phone to clear that one up. DirecTV is putting up new HD satellites that are not compatible with this receiver making it possibly useless in the future. I canceled my service because I wasn't getting good satellite reception and when I tried to sell the HD recorder, I found out it wasn't worth half what I paid for it and the access card is not transferable. Any new owner must buy a new card for $89. For 9 months of DirecTV I am out $800. I am done with the dish!!I am only giving it 2 stars because the TiVo software is so good. Be advised that future DirecTV PVRs will not be TiVo."
3,local channels?,"I was informed by Directv that I would be able to get my HD local channels. NOOOOO! Be careful when signing up for directv, if you plan on using the hd-dvr, you will not be able to receive locals. Directv did not tell me until after I signed the contract. I called cust. serv. and after speaking with a supervisors supervisor, I was finally told that the HD-dvr does not get locals and that the upcoming DVR will be able to receive locals. Back to adjusting an atenna for every channel for now."
3,Paridise it's not but may have to do!,"I love early Southside Johnny & the Asbury Jukes. And the only way to hear them is LIVE. But not on this album. For a really LIVE experience, purchase Live at the Paradise Theatre Boston, Massachusetts December 23, 1978 [LIVE] a seamless recording of one concert, not a mish-mash of different shows, performances, venues, and nights just slapped together with no cohesion like this album. With that said, if you can't find that album at a reasonable price, this one will have to do as for some reason Live at the Paradise is hard to find and people are just plain greedy in pricing this album used on Amazon. If Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes ever come to your town, go see them. They put on a great show and are still touring from time to time and without the high prices of many of todays acts."
5,"Lazy review, great album","Awesome overall sound and lyrics, great pace. No It Isn't, the slow song on the album, is probably the best.This CD makes me a little sad that blink-182 is getting back together.Favourites: Baby Come On, 155, No It Isn't, Weatherman, LillianCould have been dropped: Cliff Diving, Make You Smile"
3,"+44, hmmm not sure...","I was a bit apprehensive when buying this CD.Although i had enjoyed their first single, When Your Heart Stops Beating, i was very unsure as to how the rest of the album would be.And i was suprised with what i found.The song ""155"" is outstanding, easily the best track on the album.Some of the songs droan on and are all similar sounding, but on the whole, not a bad effort."
5,I love this album,I love every second of this album. This record has songs that are very diverse and they are all really catchy. I love +44 and cannot wait till they come out with some new material. Don't miss out on this.
2,I miss blink-182,"I liked only 6 songs from their album. I had to listen to it for a very long time in order to like other songs, besides their hit. I miss blink-182. +44 is not good."
3,Disappointing.,"I bought this along with the new Brand New. This music is just bland, rehashed ""I want this girl back"" stuff for the most part.The single was good.. But it wears and gets old quickly.Really this CD is ""Little Death"" and ""No it Isn't"" and a bunch of other songs that would be best put as ""unmemorable"". The former Members of Blink are headed for a step in the right direction, but they still need more practice in putting a real sense of emotion into their music. I don't know what they were doing on ""Make You Smile"", either. It works, but it comes off as a slap-happy pop tune and really takes away from the credibility of them making meaningful music.Standouts: ""Little Death"", ""No It Isn't""Throwaways: ""155"", ""Lillian"""
4,Average...but still better than angels and airwaves,"Rather good....i believe it is overproduced a touch,just like some of the latter 'pop punk ' blink albums ...but otherwise a good album....a mix between last album blink 182 ,take off your pants and jacket both without tom and some strange electronic influences which are refreshing...but still ..lay off the pro tools a bit and it would be a brilliant albumBest Songs 'Make You Smile' 'Cliffdiving' and 'Lycanthrope'"
4,very good,"this cd is really fun to listen to. it has a lot of great tracks like lycanthrope and make you smile. originally the band had a female guitar player/singer and i think it wouldve been cool to hear more of her. she was featured on the song ""make you smile"".while i dont love this cd like i love blink, its still a great cd and i always make sure to include it in my blink related playlists."
2,Left us wanting more,"I bought +44's first album right away, and wasn't going to get Angels and Airwave's. When Blink-182 was together I wondered what would Mark do if he had the lead vocals all to himself. I thought he'd do a lot better than this first try. Don't get me wrong it's ok, but it's nothing special. I know they were selling this album as the ""night sound"" but there greatest fault is sounding bored and tired. Where's all the energy? Where are the solid, interesting lyrics? Know I realize Mark needed Tom to add some edginess and energy, and Tom needed Mark to break up his repetitiveness and bring a solid foundation in to balance off Tom's vocal limitations. Please guys give us something more next time."
3,Why You Shouldn't Compare to Angels and Airwaves,"Two musical directions, two different minds at work, and last; two different visions. No comparison here. They are totally different. While I still prefer Tom's voice and lyrics, this album is catchy. If anything I would compare this to Blink not AVA. I think AVA is better musically(with the exception of Travis's drumming). It takes you away from the poppy/bubblegum sound of old. Although AVA's album didn't take off at first, Tom tells us there's more and it will take some time to achieve the vision. Not a bad album, a must for Blink fans but don't compare to AVA. The music is dire opposites. I give this 3 stars just for Travis's drumming."
2,The bottom DOES NOT STICK.,"I enjoy the mouse performance on it, but it just doesn't stick. Finally I had to put double sided tape on the bottom. The 3M mouse pad I bought sticks like it is permanently installed to the desk."
5,Very pleased with the WOW!PAD,"I was looking for a light colored mouse pad that work well on our black laboratory benchtops. As some of you may have experienced, an optical mouse does not work well on dark surfaces. The WOW!PAD does the job well. I like how thin the pad is and its circular shape. Just the right size for wireless mice. The sticky back holds the pad in place very well. As far as extending battery life, not sure about that. All of the wireless mice have used last for months on a single battery and thus it has not been an issue for me. In summary, I would highly recommend this mouse pad."
4,The beginning of a great saga,"This DVD was pretty good, the menus and extras aren't any different from the rest of the Frieza Saga DVDs though. The fighting didn't start until the end of the 3rd episode on this DVD. Everything before that was plot, but what great plot it is! You'd be missing out on a very important part of the saga if you didn't get this DVD. I definitely reccomend it."
5,"A very good, rather convincing book","I found this book to be very well put together and supported with mountains of evidence. Recently Mr Churhcill has come under fire from the right for some remarks he has made in the classroom. This does not surprise me since this book is a rather damning indictment of past american treatment of native americans.I was interested in this book for it's environmental implications since that is my field. Regardless, I found myself more and more interested in the humanitarian issues contained within as the book marched on. So, while I lack the socio-ethical background to provide any in depth critique of those issues, I will say that it is well put together, is interesting, and won my sympathy.All in all definately one of the better books I've read."
3,Not quite what I would have liked.,"I thought that 400 thread count Egyptian cotton would make a soft, smooth, silky sheet. This sheet really isn't. It can be quite coarse. I have slept in lovely smooth sheets at quality motels and really would like to know where to buy sheets like that. This one isn't it.Also, most companies send return information along with the packaged item. This company did not do that. If I wanted to return it, I had to look up return information on the website. I just thought that made it slightly more inconvenient.Two things I did like about the sheet were: The color is fabulously white--a pure, true white. It looks so clean. Also, the fitted sheet was deep enough to fit our mattress."
2,3d is overdone and it is kind of boring.,"This is like watching a filmstrip in 5th grade (for those of you who remember filmstrips) except with the ""Oh Wow"" factor of 3d. The 3d is at times very good, but it is also at times overdone and blurry as a result. Mostly it is kind of boring. Jim Carey is rather dry and there are long stretches between actions shots. It is also VERY EXPENSIVE for the $ vs runtime. There are far better titles you can spend your money on to show off your 3d tv. I wouldn't have purchased this DVD if I had it to do over again."
3,some great scenes but too short,I bought this bd disc as I wanted to try out my new NX810 system. Jim Carey as narrator is different. Overall there are some great 3D scenes and the depth of the documentary was quite evident. but it was way too short. For the price it could have added another hour to the film but Imax probably wants to release a part II to maximize dollars. Also you have to be sitting up or the 3d effect becomes blurry. I think that's a limitation currently of this technology. The potato cod scene was awesome!
5,Another Great 3D Under The Sea DVD,"This is a very informative DVD about life Under The Sea. It's narrated by Jim Carrey...Yes, Jim Carrey not being funny. Actually, it's quite informative and interesting and well worth the highlights of the sea.Also, very importantly, the 3D is amazing! The sea creatures really appear to be right there in my living room, er, I feel like I'm right there in the ocean.Overall, this is another really good 3D DVD showing amazing life under the sea. One of the best 3D deep sea DVD isIMAX: Deep Sea (Single-Disc Blu-ray 3D/Blu-ray Combo)and another good one isIMAX: Ocean Wonderland [Blu-ray 3D]. Enjoy!"
2,Skip this one,"Where was the 3D? Not what I paid for. Ok movie, but the 3D was barely there. Would be good for 4 years or younger."
2,Expected More,"I was so excited to receive this video. I NEVER buy videos because I'm not one to watch them over and over however, I thought this would be great to share with family and friends. Like others have said there is only ONE really good pop out. Granted the scenary is great and has several greath depth pieces.I hope someday they can make GREAT 3D's with lots of popouts. That's what makes the show.Also the price is too expensive for less then an hour video."
5,Amazing,"I only have the reg. DVD and a small 42"" set, but the picture quality is breath-taking to say the least. Sadly, to enjoy the sound effects, you have to put up with Jim Carrey's banter, of which, I don't blame him, as he had a very poor, script that was pushing the nonsense of global warming (surprised they didn't get Al Gore). The music was decent except for the last song, of which you can fast-forward it or go back to the main menu without missing a thing. I would love to see this on a large 3-d screen as the colors and scenery are just fantastic. There is one scene where a crab was invited for lunch, which might disturb the younger ones, but, nothing horrible considering what they see on T.V. nowadays. Look for the best price as this is a very short show; about 40 minutes or less. +JMJ+"
2,Didn't get to watch it.,"We weren't able to watch it, because we don't have a 3-D T.V. I thought 3-D glasses would work. but they don't."
1,Thought I was getting the 3D version.,All the other items in my original order were for 3D movies.My mistake. Didn't look close enough at checkout time.
1,Too Much For Too Little,"It's a beautiful work of art, don't get me wrong. But it's extremely short, for the $40 I paid for this movie I was expecting much more. Tax & all I paid probably $1 per minute to watch, i'll stick with redbox where the movies are $1 buck for the whole thing."
1,Horrible Narrator,"Jim Carrey is certainly no David Attenborough! Hard to ignore his total lack of skill in this genera. I'm not sure who is worse, Carrey or Oprah Winfrey in the Life series (why would anyone purchase the Life series edition narrated by her when the David Attenborough version is available?!) Please stop hiring these famous people to narrate just because they are famous. Compare the narration in this video to that of 'The Private Life of Plants' by the BBC.The video itself is a B+ but the narration just kills it for me. My 4y/o didn't seem to care though."
2,shipment is late,So far I have recieved everything I ordered AFTER I placed this one. I do not know what the problem is but would really like to get my stuff. Won't order from them again!!
4,"Great 3D shots, entertaining, and educational","Great 3D shots, entertaining, and educational. Guests liked it. Wish it was a little longer video because there are many other subjects that could be covered."
3,Mis-led by wrong reviews,The non-3D page for this title is filled with reviews on the 3D version and that what causes me to mistakenly ordered the non-3D version thinking it the former. Great service from Amazon to refund the amount but it would be great if the reviews are better organised to prevent such occurrences in future
3,It's ok,It's a very short video with very little depth. I wouldn't recommend to my family or friends other than to show a demo perhaps of the 3d.
4,"Great 3d adventure, but too short for the price I paid for the documentary",I was actually hoping for some funny moments from Jim Carrey but the narrating was pretty good anyway. I thought there was some good pop out in the movie but there were a few moments in the movie that my eyes started to hurt from the blurryness. For example there is a scene with hundreds of small fish swimming close to the screen and for some reason (could be my Panasonic Pt-AE8000u projector) it hurt my eyes and I had to squint and turn my eyes.Other than a few quirks and being so short (probably about 40 min total) I thought it was a fun 3d documentary but I wish I could have rented it.
5,BEST 3D IMAX VISUALS SO FAR!,"FOR VISUALLY OUTSTANDING 3D GO FOR THIS BLU-RAY. best 3d so far, the fish look like they come 4 feet out of the tv! MUST HAVE!WILL LEAVE YOU SMILING"
5,Great 3 D movie,"It's really good 3D in terms of depth, almost like you are scuba diving. Nothing really comes out at you. I don't imagine this movie would be very interesting if it weren't 3D but I would certainly recommend it for someone looking for a good 3D movie.On a side note, it is relatively short in length (approximately 40 min)"
2,Great picture horrible time length!,Great picture but for 41 minutes was not worth $40! Also there is global warming propaganda. Not that I'm against earth but they kept bringing it up
3,imax,It was okay. Only going to watch it once. Once is enough. Intersesting views and nice to watch but it does look like you are looking at an aquarium.
4,great visuals but very short film,"this is a gorgeous film, but at a run time of under an hour I feel like I probably should have just rented it instead of buying. that said, Jim Carrey is good - not at all annoying (as I had feared he would be)"
2,Definitely not my favorite,"I bought this for my scuba-loving husband, after reading reviews about how wonderful the colors are. In truth, they are beautiful, and very vivid. Now if only they had spent more time on various fish instead of the primary focus being on scuttlefish, sea eels, and sea snakes....none of which do anything for me, or my husband. Or anybody else who has watched it with us. Most people ask us to turn it off eventually because the snakes/eel get to be too much. And there's at least 15+ minutes of scuttlefish. Interesting how they change colors, and all, but 15 out of 40 minutes?? And Jim Carrey, while I love him as an actor, sounds a little too gleeful as the narrator. All in all, a pretty odd show."
3,A nice demonstration of 3D but disappoints near the end.,"This is the first 3D blu ray movie that I bought for my new TV and blu ray player. I didn't know what to expect but the first 15 minutes or so did not disappoint. The movie started at a coral reef and the colors were spectacular on the reef and the fish. The 3D effects were quite good and some fish and snakes appeared to come out of the screen, really nice. However when the movie moved on the colors were not as beautiful and the effects diminished significantly. So not a bad movie to demonstrate the 3D effects of your TV but the movie was quite short and needed to continue the effects of the first part of the movie. Because of this the end was a let down."
4,Beautiful,This was a very beautiful movie. Felt like you were under the water swimming with the fish. I was hoping for more but was satisfied.
4,Amazing 3D quality,This is a slightly boring story but the 3D quality is amazing and is great for showing off your 3D T.V. to your friends!!!
5,Great 3D Experience,"The family and I enjoyed watching this DVD in 3D and we had a great experience. The picture, sound quality, music, and narration are all 5-star. And the 3D effects are perfect. Some of the scenes that show sea animals and plants attacking their prey will put you at the edge of your seat. Definitely recommended and worth its price. A worthy addition to your 3D show-off collection."
5,"Just amazing , Must have for great 3D effects","Just amazing , Must have for great 3D effects loved it. Best 3D effecs and great to see what's under the Sea."
3,Could be better,"Having seen snippets of 3D underwater shots available for free on my tv, I was hoping for something more spectacular from an IMAX movie. Here and there during the movie there are some brilliant colors and good 3D effects, but there's too much of the movie that's like a standard ocean documentary. If you're going to film in IMAX 3D, film things that take advantage of that! Take the camera right through groups of fish, let large fish/mammals swim right past the camera, bubbles always look cool as they seem to really come out into the room, get objects in the foreground as you film your subject, etc...When this far too short a movie finished (it's only 40 min), I was left feeling like a had watched a cheap knock-off of an IMAX. It's definitely not worth $30. If it gets down to $10-15, I might recommend it."
5,Amazing 3D picture and colors,"I just bought my 3D TV this week, so spent hours reading reviews to order the best 3D movies that I could find. This movie was what I was looking for in terms of 3D experience. The film has amazing color, 3D depth, and footage.There are lots of scenes where they showcase a variety of underwater life and pick out fish/rocks with deep depth in color. There are schools of fish and some fish that I never seen before this film. It's really like being under the sea and will WOW any of our friends that come over and watch the film. The only draw backs (minor) are that they do not showcase large animals (shark, Whale...) very long or in some instances not at all (Whale). It's a ""must buy"" for your 3D collection!"
4,EXCELLENT 3D,"THE DOCUMENTARY IS FUN TO WATCH. THE 3D IS EXCELLENT. IT'S THE PRICE THAT GIVES ME PAUSE. FOR 40 MINUTES OF FOOTAGE, YOU COULD GET A LOT MORE BANG FOR THE BUCK. OH YEAH, THE POP OUT WITH THE COD FISH IS UNMATCHED IN ANY MOVIE I'VE SEEN TO DATE. IT IS AS THOUGH YOU COULD ALMOST KISS THE FISH, IT COMES SO CLOSE TO YOUR FACE."
3,IMAX: Under the Sea 3D movie,"I enjoyed the movie, but thought it could have been longer. The colors and scenes under the sea were brilliant."
3,Just OK,"The 3D wasn't that great, I was very disappointed with the 3D effects, could have been better, If this is your first introduction to 3D I wouldn't recommend it. You can skip it, there are other IMAX movies that are much better than this one."
2,Really short,Only 40 minutes. It's stunning footage but not worth the price for not even an hour of programming. 3d feature makes you feel like you are under water:)
2,under the sea,"I don't received my product, please help me?I""d like ones 3D video not to much expensive please.I LIve in Brasil, and i make my order have a many time, but i don't received yeat.Whats happen?"
1,Not worth the money,We have just bought a 3D TV so are looking for DVDs that look 3D. We sat back put on our glasses and nothing popped out at us. It was beautiful with the colors but not much better then HD. I doubt if we will ever even watch the movie again so it was a waste of our money.
1,Buyers Beware!!,"In spite of Amazon.com's reviewer stating this item was filmed in 3D, the fact is ,it will not play in 3D.YOU ONLY GET A 2D VERSION. Very dissapointing! It should not be listed under 3D blu ray."
1,....IMAX Is...,....The Biggest Rip Off On DVD..And Theaters...BIG TICKET PRICES And Your Out In 40 Minutes On Anything They Show..On This Film Carrey Sucks As Narrator..!..P/U
2,boring,vivid colors and pretty but not what I expected. Too much talking.... I was expecting a movie.Don't care for it much
4,Great FIRST 3D movie!,"I only gave this 4 stars because there are obviously better movies out there than fish swimming around. But as a first 3D movie, this is inexpensive and good for all ages to watch and enjoy!"
3,"this was pretty good,not as good as i expected.",the colors were good..jim carrey was ok and the length was too short...overall it was an ok experience. i guess for the price it is worth it
5,Very Pleased,"What a great movie this was, very pleased with time in which I received it and it was worth the wait."
4,Imax Under the Sea,"We hadn't realized that we did not order the 3D version, but we still enjoyed it very much. Can't wait to have the chance to get it in 3D."
2,Help Playing 2D Version,"Help! I purchased The Blu-Ray 3D + Blu-Ray combo pack, but only the 3D disc was in the package. The 3D disc won't load because I don't have a 3D player. How do I play the 2D version? Am I missing a disc?"
4,Great movie,I purchased this video for my granddaughters. They LOVED it!!! The picture was beautiful and the 3d effect was great. Only complaint--too short.
4,Amazing 3D images,"This is one of the best 3D images I've ever seen. There is no action, no sound effects (so it may be boring for more than 30min) but impresses to show your 3D TV. My 3 years old son liked it."
4,Beautiful colors,"The colors are beautiful. 3D effects are good, not great. I have seen some 3D that makes you feel like you can reach out and touch the objects coming out of your tv. Other than a couple scenes,this video does not give you that feeling. The music background almost drowns out the narration. I must say that it is very relaxing to watch.I don't feel that it is worth the price paid."
2,A really boring movie with bad narration.,"I am lukewarm to this video as there are only about 4 scenes where some ugly fish comes out at you, which makes it a good demo disk but a really boring subject if you're not into fish eating fish. So if the movie doesn't put you to sleep Jim Carrey's narration will. In fact we found his voice so weak the music overpowers him...and he sounds totally bored. I also found using a PS3 was very sensitive to finger prints on the disk...even a small smudge would freeze the movie while it never bothered my other disks."
1,horrible parallax in 3D..IMAX what were you thinking ?,"I am a huge 3D fan and enjoyed many IMAX 3D titles both in theaters and at homeI fell for the hype and bought this only to end up getting a headache owing to horrible parallax (not cross-talk). Almost all scenes had convergence issues where you felt like you were squinting. To illustrate what I mean, focus on your forefinger and bring it close to you eye and you will fell onset of a headache...Not sure if this is the best they can do with under water cameras, but 3D was horrible for almost all underwater scenes. Surprisingly this convergence issue was not seen for the handful of above water scenes. Otherwise I enjoyed the narration and some colorful scenes"
3,Expected it to be better,"People like lists.Pros:1- Excellent crisp & clear image.2- Nice 3D effect but not wow. In some instances (water snake) it looks so good, but in others it doesn't (when there's lots of similar patterns)Cons:1- Short."
3,Nice to watch with MUTE on.,"I have to give the 3D and video quality a 5 star, but the ""Global Warming Narration and audio mix a 1 star... The length is about a typical IMAX film would be.Jim Carey is the narrator, and it is at time difficult to hear what he is saying as the audio mix leaves him at a lower level than the background music and sound FX.The other part is the whole ""global warming"" being gently shoved down the throat, all the while contradicting their own narration. . . for example, he states that the ocean levels at one time were 400 feet lower than they are today. Yet somehow WE humans are responsible for ""global warming""(what exactly did WE do those thousands/ millions of years ago to cause that rise in ocean levels?). There were a couple of other examples, but that was the most glaring one to me... So from now on, I'll watch it on mute with some other music."
1,Shady practices - seller abundatrade,"Purchased this ""combo"". The seller (abundatrade) only shipped the 3D version and covered-up the UPC area where the manufacturer had printed ""NOT FOR INDIVIDUAL SALE"". I assume this is because the discs were part of a combo pack as is the case with other combos I have purchased. Buyer beware when purchasing from this merchant."
5,a excellent nature 3d show.,"This 3d feature looks stunning on blu ray 3d. It was of course a 45 minute 3max show that is a nature program. The one star ratings on this are by people who don't understand what underwater 3d is about. IN fact 3d is often used just for depth and not for things coming out at you. GET OVER THIS IDEA. Jim carrey makes a whimsical narrator on this one and he's clearly enjoying his job!. The show like all modern nature shows gives a glimpse of the vanishing ocean vistas that man is destroying. If you don't like short nature programs then don't buy imax blu ray shows. If you do this is a good underwater one. THere was only one scene where my 3d went double vision on me, some releases do that much more. So all and all this is a good one for nature lovers who want some depth to the picture."
3,"Great 3d, but way too short","This was absolutely stunning 3d but as I was really getting into it waiting for the next creature to be displayed, it was all over. Also, that false global warming myth was talked about more than the creatures of the sea. Despite the political agenda this bluray seemed to shout at us, the movie was still lacking. Lacking more time and lacking my sea life. They spent more time on the cuttle fish than any other creature out there. If they come out with an under the sea 2 I'll be sure to check the running time first before I buy."
2,"2D is OK but short, 3D is depressing","I wanted to like this, I wanted the reviews it received to be accurate and to the point. But this film is terrible in 3D. I got headaches from the ghosting that occurred throughout the movie. Heed the negative reviews warnings. My setup - LG LW5300 47"" . . . Sony Playstation 3 . . . HDMI 1.4b cables sitting 7.5 feet away. There are some ok moments, but not enough to justify a purchase. This will sadly be my last IMAX Bluray to try. Life and Planet Earth Blu-ray look much much better unconverted from 2D to 3D. Again, maybe it's better with active shutter TV, but with LG passive 3D, the images just do not pop and tend to Ghost."
5,Another IMAX great film,"It is for a good reason that IMAX is #1 for 3D! This film is excellent! Most beautiful colors, stunning shots, and really three-dimensional images. The depth is excellent! The music is also top-notch, written for this sequence, and the notes follows every move of any creature. Jim Carey is not doing so bad, sounds more professional than his ice ventura renditions. The only thing is that I dont see crystal clear quality, maybe 80 % or so. Not the crispness of 'tangled'. Despite, 'under the sea' is a movie i will enjoy over and over. Thanx IMAX! ^___^"
5,Fantastic!,"I love this movie. Absolutely goregeous photography and very good 3d effect. I don't understand the review critical of Jim Carrey's narration. It is not over the top as if he is doing the narration as Ace Ventura or something. As with just about all the Imax movies, it is less than an hour, but I still am very happy with the purchase. It will also have a bit of an environmental ""save the oceans"" message but that is just fine with me. As a scuba diver who just can't get into the water often enough, this provides a fantastic escape."
3,Great picture but boring story.,This is a great video if you want to have a great shot with your 3D devices. But once you watch it you won't feel watching it again. There isn't much of a story or anything that makes you want to come back for more other than the great picture.
4,great learning dvd,My son loved this dvd. He really enjoyed learning about the different sea creatures and their odd ways of life.
2,DO NOT BUY,"If you want to waste $34 bucks than this is it.The whole film last about less than 20 mintues, nothing extraordianry or exciting.Pros: Whole film only 1 scene where a cod fish reach out about 30% and that about it folk.Cons: Beautiful color?? not that great either. Film is boring and I'm glad they make it short. This got to be the worst Imax ever I have seen."
3,Some good scenes,"Some of the 3D scenes are good. But overall, it is not worth the price. The footage is too short, and the narration is not very clear."
5,Beautiful,My two and four tear old boys love this dvs. They watch it all the time. The pictures are beautiful and the story line is interesting.
5,My grandson loves it,"Bought at Amazon, surprised Jim Carrey does such a good narration. 3-d is excellent with a few pop out-of-the-screen shots you feel you could reach out and touch. Depth and Color is great. Very educational, you may see many familiar fish as seen off our pacific coast, but also many exotic fish, coral and sea life from around the world. My 3 year old grandson loves it and requests to watch it everytime he comes to visit. I ended up buying him the standard dvd version from amazon and had it sent to his home. Well worth the money."
3,not the best 3d,Where do I start. The colours and 3d seem ok I have seen 3D on a friends TV and think this wasnt as good. Seemed to be blurry at the edges. I was playing it on a panasonic 3d bluray player through and LG LED 3D HD TV.I dont think its value for money as its not very long. Maybe at half the price it would be a good introduction to 3D
3,"Ok, if you like cuddle fish!","The are some beautiful and amazing sea creatures in the film. However, considering the vast amount of different species that live in the oceans, I feel the film fell short. Unless you love the cuddle fish, then you may be a little disappointed as I was. There seemed to be more footage on the cuddle fish that all the other creatures combined.Jim Carrey was never one of my favorite actors. Now, he is, also, not one of my favorite narrators."
5,Amazing Album,"Every song is great! One of the best albums I have bought in a really long time. I can't stop listening. Some of my favorite tracks are ""Rise,"" ""Bi Polar Baby"" and ""Boom Boom."""
4,Flipping for Dailey,"I had read that Roger McGuinn made a guest appearance on Will Dailey's""Peace of Mind"" song. Being a huge McGuinn follower, I played the sample cut on Dailey's website and loved it.As a result, I decided to take a chance on ""Back Flipping Forward"".At first, I found it to be just ok, however, the more I played it, the better it sounded.Bottom line............Dailey is a young musician/songwriter/vocalist with much talent. I really like his versatile songwriting and voice.Bought it at a great price via Amazon and it was well worth it.This cd is a ""buy"", in my book, and am looking forward to his next release."
3,My review,"Well first of all the fangs looked great, they matched my teeth good but they were a pain and a half to put in. The custom fit putty would not hold them in properly. It took forever to dry and once it did they did not snap in and out like they were supossed to. I evantully ended up glueing them in with nail glue, sounds silly but I needed them to stay. The only good thing was they were a custom fit but you might need to use glue when you put them in."
2,"great service and concept, but glue wouldn't work","They look great, and others seem to think the glue works, but I wasted an entire package and never got the teeth to stay on."
5,Great for small mouth,I wore these to my phlebotomy class and they didn't fall out once. Don't worry I took them out and washed my hands before the procedures. I was able to close my mouth which I couldn't do with normal fangs. They are cute and sexy.
5,Scarecrow Vampire Fang Review,"The Scarecrow Vampire Fangs arrived on time in wonderful condition. The directions seem a little overwhelming at first, but don't worry they provide a YouTube video name. The video walks you through what you need to know and makes it easy to understand. Pay attention to the warnings on the back about what drinks will discolor the teeth and other do's and dont's. Overall fun toy."
3,Look cool but bonding is hard to use and fit right.,Good fit. Looks real.Bonding is hard to work with and teeth fell out a few times before a decent fit.
3,just ok,"it was easy enough to use, but my 8yo said the glue tasted horrible for hours after, but they stayed put"
2,size issues,"Teeth did not fit my teeth well, before or after adding the glue. Kit was easy to understand, and everything was as described. The product just is not for people with dainty teeth :("
5,Cute and good quality,"If you are a female or just looking for little fangs, these are great. I originally bought them for my Selene costume and they were perfect. I still fit snug when I wear them on occasions that require costumes and goth clubs, just don't eat or drink with them in as they can pop off."
3,Girls Next Door to a Plastic Surgeon,"There are a lot of pretty girls on this DVD, but they are obviously models, with their features enhanced by lots of make up, and, of course, by surgery. Only one MOVED with any fluidity. The production values were on a par with one of Playboy's stupid videos of naked women doing illogical things in a wilderness enviornment which would require garments as protection from the elements. Not very natural, all in all, and not the type of girls you'll find next door to YOU."
4,Cute,"I'm an anti-Twilight, but a big fan of mother of pearl. I was specifically looking for a small-sized MOP and I found it doing a search under jewelry. I didn't know that it was an EA celeb creation to appease Twitards. I like the asymmetrical band setting, but EA should tell fans it ISN'T a cabochon, but a FLAT MOP (the photo is a bit deceptive)."
5,Very inspirational,This is an quick easy book to read and inspires me every time I re-read it. Jim's heart for Christ and also doing our personal best inspires me.
5,Non Stop Pleasure,"Oooh Boy, oooooh Boy. I have never known Professor Harris, but I can imagine the kind of gentlemen he would be. This book is a distilled NON STOP pleasure. Every little sentence, and I mean, Literally every little sentence, will get to the sweet spot, and tickle you again again, until you have spent the whole of yourself, and are wondering, what , what exactly is there after ecstasy. I am a radio engineer, since the last 20 years, but have spent almost half a decade, building line modems for a living. This book, with every word, hits me in the right spots, but then, this kind of background is a little clumsy. Nonetheless, I suspect if you are a communication engineer and a little into wireless this guy is going to get groans out of you !!!!!!"
2,Maybe I am the only one who didn't get much out of this book,"I was hoping to get a good understanding of multirate DSP out of this text, having no knowledge of it previously. However, I was not succesful. The text starts out well with a practical illuminating example of the use of multirate signal processing. However, I was not able to absorb much knowledge in the subsequent chapters and gave up on continuing. There are very few equations in this book, which to me was initially promising as I am tired of DSP math books. The author relies more on graphics and figures to explain his point, but I found that the detail was lacking. Perhaps someone with stronger background in this area would be better served by this text."
5,The Reference Standard for Multirate Processing,"I wish this work were available when I was implementing multi-rate, multi stage filters with MSI integrated circuits and a wire wrap gun! But we are now in the FPGA world, and professor harris's work is in tune with today's hardware implementations. His attention to implementation efficiency with realistic comparisons is valuable. My only minor ""ding"" would be that some of the MATLAB code is not well documented and the results take some effort to interpret. That said, having the MATLAB code is a BIG plus. Even better would be to have Simulink models of the filters."
5,A DSP classic!,"Every decade or so a book comes out that distills a lot if scattered knowledge on an important subject into one concise and comprehensible tutorial. This is such a book. It introduces new ideas on better ways to skin the proverbial DSP cat!This book clearly explains sampling rate switching architectures and how they can greatly reduce processing cycles and simplify digital and analog hardware. I've used a few of these tricks in the past, but what an eye opener to see so many great examples of sneaky DSP.Fred Harris makes it clear with vivid examples and MatLab illustrations that using multi-rate signal processing moves you into a whole new class of implementations. No longer does one ask, ""What sampling rate do I need to satisfy Nyquist? The question is now, ""What sampling rate do I need in each section to optimize the design? This book helps the DSP practitioner answer that question. The sampling rate degree of freedom liberates! Use it and prosper!"
4,Great kids toy,"This puppet looks good enough to use on stage, but more importantly my little brother really loved it. He was two at the time and is now going on four and he still has this puppet. Our baby sister is starting to play with it now too. It's as huggable as a stuffed animal, but you can make it talk and eat (not recommended) and practically come alive."
2,Looks good but mouth is bad,"It looks great, really funny, but the movable mouth is useless. It's too small and the way your fingers position in it makes it almost impossible to move. I wanted something that I could make ""talk"" so I am returning it."
5,A well loved toy!,"My daughter (15 mo old) first found this cat puppet at a toy store while we were on vacation and it hasn't left her side since. I bought another from amazon.com as a back up in case she ever loses one. I would say that this is a very durable toy, especially since my daughter, for some reason, loves to bite out its fur. Any way, it's an awesome toy that I think any toddler who likes cats would really love."
5,awesome,The story that comes with this cat is amazing and my little boy carries him around everywhere - he is adorable and soft and has really brought joy to my child
3,Good quality BUT.........,I ordered this puppet based on the pictures they supplied on the site it seemed to be a large puppet not to large but large enough to appear as a big cat sitting on your arm as you use it. To my surprise this puppet is slightly larger them my (looks like a cat glove) I am a performer & I'm always looking for new things to incorporate into my act the way the pictures showed detail & appearance of size made this a perfect addition but when I got it home I was disappointed with size & even the difference In the puppet I have compared to the photo they have shown. This is a great item for kids to keep them entertained. But as for me I never like when infomercials or even website make something appear more then what it really is. The quality of this item is fair. But much smaller then what I was expecting. Detail in the cars face also very different from what is shown in the picture.
3,Hello Grumpy Cat!,"I've brought this puppet out in storytime and had kids ask me ""what is it?"" This is not your common cat. This is a grumpy feline! He has played a role for me, in that he does so perfectly convey a grumpy face, but he is not the most expressive puppet in my collection. His mouth movement limits his expressive options, but he does stuck-up cat very well! The fur is long, but not especially soft, so he's really not a cuddler. He's just unique, and ultimately just a marginal recommend. Anyone with large hands will probably not be able to manipulate his mouth, or perhaps even his front paws. I don't use him that often, but he always makes an impression!"
3,Sweet,"This ring is sweet and bright. The stone is small, but it is nice for a child; however: the stone fell out of my daughter's ring, and I'm trying to replace it (not as easy as it looks.) I wonder if that stone falling out is a fluke, because the stone in my ring seems to be in very well. It is quite a pretty little ring."
4,Every Jew should have a copy of the Siddur they use,"This is the Siddur used in my congretation. It is good, and my rabbi agrees, that we all should have a copy of the Siddur in our home libraries. If you are not affiliated, but wish to own a Siddur, I can recommend this one as it has the Hebrew, English translations and also many transliterations throughout."
3,"Should have been called ""Sometimes Topless Games""","This video wasn't a total disappointment. It was actually kind of funny. The girls were pretty, and many of them were topless at least part of the time. The events are kind of ridiculous. Think drunken beach games, not actual sports."
4,GREAT PRODUCT WITH NO FEET - AMAZING DESIGN FLAW!,"KITCHENAID - YOUR PRODUCTS SHINE AS DOES THIS ONE! ONE QUESTION - KNOWING WELL THAT MOST OF YOUR CUSTOMERS USE THIS IN THE KITCHEN ON TILE COUNTERS - HOW IN THE WORLD WOULD YOU SHIP A PRODUCT WITH NO RUBBER FEET???? WHILE GRINDING, IT'S LIKE TRYING TO HOLD DOWN A HOCKEY PUCK!"
2,Very uneven grind,"Like most Kitchen Aid products, this grinder is very sturdy and seems like it would hold up to commercial use. That being said, it produces a very uneven grind. The consistency ranges from a fine dust to WHOLE BEANS THAT HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN TOUCHED BY THE BLADE all in the same batch of coffee. I'm normally a big fan a Kitchen Aid, but the cheaper Braun model I used to own was far superior to this grinder."
5,All other grinders no longer exist!,"Never will I need a different grinder. And if KitchenAid ever stops making it they will have a mob of caffeine junkies taking over a factory somewhere. Screw the dishwasher, this baby is so easy to clean by simply rinsing the stainless bowl under the faucet for a couple of seconds, wiping it out with a paper towel (or flour sack towel reserved for coffee stains) and taking the damp towel and wiping out the clear lid. (The very tiny little groove in the top of the lid, is easily cleaned with an edge of the towel) It holds twice as many beans as my coffee maker. I use it to grind larger amounts of seeds and spices, too, and even that only takes a quick wash with soapy water. I let it air dry by turning the lid 90 degrees so it rests on the little nubbies on the base. Perfect pretty perky appliance. And looks so sexy on my counter top, too!"
2,Wouldn't buy again,We are disappointed in this grinder. The plastic cover has a ridge around the top that the coffee gets stuck in. This prevents the grinder from working until you clean out the ridge.It's just a hassle.
1,Don't buy. Mine broke on 1st use. Will not use Amazon again.,My brand new Kitchen Aide broke this morning making it's first cup of coffee. It started just fine and then stopped grinding. I have nothing but coffee beans and no way to grind them. No coffee this morning for me. Very frustrating. I just started using Amazon last week but will avoid them from now on.
4,Woo hoo,Powerful lil guy. Its made in India which explains why it works so well for the purpose it is meant for- spice grinding. It has a powerful motor and pulverised my rock salt in a jiffy. My only complaint with the design is that there is a space between the lid and the container so there are powder spills ..
5,From the back cover,"From cover to cover, Campbell's Fabulous One Dish Recipes offers dozens of great tasting recipes ideal for quick family meals and easy entertaining.

You won't want to miss serving these M'm! M'm! Good! Favorites from Campbell's."
3,"Good, but not the best","I have been searching for an animal encyclopedia and when I saw this I thought it was exactly what I was looking for. It covers the surface of animals, but it was not nearly as in depth as I was expecting.This book is basically a summary of David Burnie's ""Illustrated Encyclopedia of Animals"". If you're looking for a one-stop, everything-you-need book that covers it all, check out the ""Illustrated Encyclopedia of Animals"" by David Burnie. Unfortunately you can only get this from the UK, try Amazon.co.uk. It's so worth it."
4,Love me or Leave me,I love anything Elise Neal so that pretty much sums it up but anyway it is definitely worth watching witha fine cast and very good acting
4,Good but needed more depth,"Just got this movie. It is good but I think it needed to run a bit longer for the themes to be well drawn out. For a stage play it was very clear and audible. The acting was good, just needed more depth."
2,very old technology,An excellent story and take on Columbuse's life but I was barely able to watch the movie and found lots of problem with sound and images in another word this product is very oudated for today's technology. I hope they digitally re-mastering it. it worth all the effort.
3,A Good Medical Thriller,"I liked this book, but I have to admit I was a bit dissappointed. Life Support has a very sturdy and entertaining story line, but it lacks some of the insightfulness of either Crichton or Preston. All in all a good Medical Thriller, but nothing exceptional in my opinion."
3,just o.k,"Just not one of her best books. I read some of her other books. I would tell anyone thinking about reading her to read either The Surgeon or Gravity both are better. After that, read this if you all would like. Only for true for fans of the author."
4,Gripping read,"Life Support is the first book I have read by this author, but it definitely won't be the last! The story is well paced and gripping with good characterization. The plot revolves around an upscale retirement community whose doctors have discovered a way to prolong an individual's natural lifespan; unfortunately, the procedure can also create horrific consequences. Dr. Toby Harper, a doctor working in a local ER, admits two of these retirees and is baffled by their symptoms. Her determination to get to the bottom of the case ultimately threatens her very life. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys medical thrillers."
4,Just read it :),"The topic research Gerritsen does shines through in the way she is able to create a character as a specialist within a field. Life Support is no different in this way. It presents a plausible idea (at least plausible to anyone who isn't rich.. lol), with a couple of current issues many of us face in our aging families. Add another smart woman running around trying to save everyone while tentatively falling in love and you've got a story that keeps the pages turning well into the night :)I also must add that what I enjoy most about every Gerritsen book I read is the story within the story. A young woman-child makes some bad decisions early in life and finds herself in a nightmare. You can't help but hold your breath for her as well."
5,Fascinating and Intense!,"I enjoyed the book immensely and would not hesitate recommending it to others. I found it to be excellent. Since my husband is a physician, I found the book to be the ultimate medical thriller."
4,Excellent read,Excellent book and a typical Gerritsen plot. Funny to be reading about Boston and not have Rizzoli and Isles in the plot but still well written with many twists.
2,Could not get past the 4th chapter.,I enjoyed Harvest but I thought Life Support was a bore. It never caught my interest and never even intrigued me. Don't bother with it.
4,Another Really Good Gerritsen Book,"This was not my favorite of all Tess Garritsen's books (I liked Gravity and Bloodstream a little more), but it was still a very good, fast read and quite entertaining. I'd recommend it."
5,Good Book- Medical Thriller,"I really thoroughly enjoyed this book. Toby was a good main character to the problems that were faced in the ER. It was interesting how dr. carl wallenberg was opposing her so much of the time! To find out more, read the book!"
4,useful book,"it is really an useful book because iam a medical student, i get a lot of medical information from it."
3,"Better than ""Harvest,"" but a Little Hard to Take","While better than the thoroughly predictable ""Harvest,"" Ms. Gerritsen's second medical thriller still isn't that great. She sets off with a great creepy prologue and builds continual suspense throughout, yet the book is so relentlessly downbeat it's a little hard to take. Basically, everything that could go wrong for our heroine does: she's accused of abusing her mother, all of her allies end up dead, and the whole world basically turns against her. I personally read for enjoyment, and I found it hard to enjoy one horrible thing happening to this woman after another. Maybe people who get off on the endless suffering on ""Party of Five"" will enjoy it. I don't know. The medical detail is superb and Gerritsen keeps you on your toes, but the book's so painful (even the ending) that I left it more depressed than satisfied. Proceed at your own risk."
2,Life Support,"Gerritsen's books are pretty good and creative the first time, and possibly the second, but after the third book they become very formulaic. Intellegent damsel, overworked, over tired, put upon by evil doers, and oh by the way, there is a handsome rescuer in there somewhere. Yuck!!"
2,Disappointing medical thriller,"Tess Gerritsen's LIFE SUPPORT is a disappointing medical thriller. While the medical jargon lends authenticity to the read, it quickly overwhelms the very thin story. It's easy to guess who done it and why and since the lead doesn't get into any real jeopardy along the way, the ride isn't even particularly interesting. If you're looking for a good mystery writer, try Lisa Gardner instead. She understands pacing, character development, and her stories will get your heart pumping."
4,Plausible for a medical thriller,Most books of this type are flat out silly. This had all the hallmarks of something that could happen in real life. The characters and the science were very convincing. The only part where it felt like the story advanced into the silly territory was right at the end. Some details were left out that would have made this a fabulous medical thriller.
5,Read it!,"This is one of those books that I find hard to summarize without giving away spoilers or too much information, sometimes even the ending. So this time around, I will not try to write one.However, I can say that this is Tess Gerritsen's second medical thriller book. Tess Gerritsen is one of my favorite suspense/thriller authors, if not my ultimate favorite. This novel did not fail.If you have a faint-heart, can not stand even the slightest mention of blood, then this is probably not for you. Because just on the very first page, there is already a mention of these things; things that Gerritsen describes so well.I really love Gerritsen, as you, by now, can already see. She writes all the scary things that get to your head at night (not talking about ghosts though), and her books are fast-paced and has so much action that you can't dare miss.Life Support is not an exception. It was good. Read. it. =)"
4,The Plot Thickens,"I really liked this book for a light read. It was exciting and the pace kept the reader's interest. I agree that the main character was a little shallow. She jumped to conclusions, was too hystrionic, and sometimes came across as a ""blonde"" (I wonder if she was) for me. I enjoy a story in which everyone spots the bad guy right from the first. That lets the reader in on the plot. There continued to be surprises, however, that enriched the experience through their unexpected appearances. The flavor of conspiracy kept everyone guessing. I agree with some critics that stated the ending was weak. It was fast and aburpt and did not tie up loose ends. When the reader knows the bad guy and waits for him to get his just desserts, there is some relish in prolonged revenge. It would also have been nice to know if the romance came to fruition and what happened to the corporate organization. Oh well, it's worth the reading."
5,Hannah is a truly gifted author.,"My copy of ""If You Believe"" is well worn and in rather sad shape because I've read it so many times. I never tire of Mad Dog & Mariah's story. Their struggles to overcome personal demons are written with touching insight and a tender heart."
3,Disappointing,"After reading many, many books by Kristin Hannah, I was disappointed in the last two and figure they must have been early works."
2,A bit of a disappointment,"Given the period this book was set in, some of the character's actions were a little unbelievable. I have read several Kristin Hannah novels and have enjoyed most, some of them greatly. But in this case I felt it was more of a 'trashy novel' without much substance. The only saving grace was at the end, and I won't say more, as it would be a spoiler."
5,a healing tale,"This is a book about finding, forgiving, loving and letting go. The characters aren't perfect, but all have good qualities. There isn't the usual falling into each others arms and living happily ever after. They work at theirs lives and fight for a chance to love. Ms.Hannah gives a good read."
4,Be prepared...,"This book is hard to read. Ever seen the movie 'The Blue Lagoon'? Especially late at night? It left me with a hollow feeling, a sadness that echoed into the depths of my very soul. This book is about 2 people in their mid-thirties who fall in love against their wills. Its painful to read because of the depth of emotion, the heroine's relationship with her father and Mad Dog, as well as his relationship with his son, whom he doesn't know is related. Make any sense? ...Anyway, if I could go back in time I wouldn't have read this book. It left me with a bittersweet taste in my mouth - a compelling tale, but I think I'll stick to lighter reads from now on."
4,More future deaths than show on t.v.,"In the episode "" Ghost of Tommorow"" we see the violent deaths of Yajorobie, Tien, and Yachcha. The rest of the tape is okay."
5,The Fergfurguson Rifle,This was a very interesting story and followed L'Amours usual high standard of storytelling. It made excellent reading and I look forward to more.
3,good story,"This was an enternaining story but it will never be a classic. The character's are strong, but like most L'amour books, theres not enough time to really get a feel for them. It moves along to fast."
1,"Lies, almost no Bunkai","Classical Kata shows Bunkai on back cover, but no Bunkai on DvDTraditional Kata claims on cover there ins Bunkai, nope none there at allOriginal katas says Bunkai for the above kata, lists 7 kats and then says and more, only Bunkai is for the Pinan, and since I have his book these videos are useless to me.If you are just trying to learn the forms , not bad, but since I know all the forms from a similar system the only value these where to me was the bunkai and , well , False Advertising"
4,Loved reading this again,I had read Uncle Tom's Cabin years ago as a required read in school. Fifty years later it was fun to read again and to enjoy in a much different way with an appreciation for the time in which it was written. I have decided to re-read many of the classics with a different set of eyes and experiences with which to see the wisdom of the writing.
3,Mature enough to understand,"How can I say ""wonderful insight"" into slavery? Because I was shielded from it and now I can become informed. Too much religion which draws out the story but I endured. GJM"
2,Print too small,Book has very tiny print making it a tough read. Would have been better if it were normal font size.
5,"cal-king 10"" foam mattress",this mattress was one of the best decisions I've made in a long time. The mattress was delivered very fast and in perfect condition. All my pain has disappeared when I awake the next morning. This mattress is much better than any traditional mattress I've owned. It also fluffs right back up and feels like a new mattress every time you lay back down on it.
1,Cal King,"This bed is so hard! My husband likes it because he likes a firm mattress but for me it feels like sleeping on a bed of rocks! I did read the reviews prior to purchasing and some of them did say it was firm but would soften over time. It hasn't softened. My only relief is to put a down comforter on the top and sleep on that. Let's just say it's no Tempur-Pedic but we didn't have $5000 for a bed either. That said, it pretty much is what it said it was.Update: We have had this bed since April of 2011. It has not soften one bit! Still hard as a rock and causing both my husband and I pain in the morning. My husband says he likes a firm mattress but not a bed of rocks. It is too heavy to return and would cost a fortune on shipping plus we would only get a partial credit. Don't buy this or any bed like it unless you really like a very very hard bed!! I even purchased a 4 inch pillow top and that didn't even make it better. We are stuck! With a mattress we hate!!"
3,Stiffer than I expected,Buy a mattress in a box and don't be surprised if it isn't what you expected. All the statistics about foam density can't convey the hardness of the mattress. It takes a month to let all the fumes out.
3,Didn't need it,The hand mixer came with this included. Wish you'd told me - so now I have two in case one breaks. Too much trouble to return.
3,Hand Mixer Whisk,"Eh- it does what it needs to do, what more can you ask. Except not to have to write 7 more words to submit this."
1,Not compatible,"I recently purchased the Cuisinart hand mixer which I love, but thewhisk they said was compatible with the mixer is not. I did not returnit to amazon because it would cost more than the refund amount."
1,Cuisart CHM-WSK Hand Mixer Whisk,"The whisk comes with the mixer, and the mixer description did NOT clearly state it. I bought the mixer and the whisk separately. Now have 2 whisks and only need 1.It's a tad annoying."
1,Kick A** Texas Rock,"This is a four star cd, don't know why it only shows 1 star here. I have seen this band live 2 different times with Bugs Henderson playing along side John Nitzinger, wow what a show. I just bought the cd and love it all over again. Don't pass this one up."
5,Book that should be required reading for all students who want to be knowledgeable of American History,This book by J.A. Rogers is just an insightful and great treasure chest of knowledge that every student needs to read to understand the great sacrifice and contributions that Africans have bestowed on this country.
1,Defective !,"I purchased the ""Oritron DVD 200 DVD-Video Player"" as a second player, and it could only play a few of my DVDs. It suffered from severe skipping as well as audible pops and clicks. Overall, it was a total lemon !"
2,I wish I had gone with a different DVD Player,I agree with the gentleman who said this player sticks a lot. I have had nothing but problems trying to get different DVD's to work in this piece of work. I would never purchase another Oritron product. The only thing I liked about this player was the price but I will probably go out and purchase a different player as soon as I can afford it.
2,Consider the Toshiba instead,"About 6 mos ago I was in market for a DVD player and wanted to pay a little as possible for a completely satifcatory machine. Lots of research, reading of reviews and finally settled on a Toshiba SD1200. 6 mos later I can only say great things about the quality of the viewing and machine. I stumbled across the negative reivews on this player and wanted to provide cheapskates like myself an alternative player that was hassle free. When I was purchasing their were many issues with the low-end Sony (reportedly since corrected) but I took the leap to Toshiba and would recommend it to others. Pay the extra bucks and relieve yourself of 2 hours on the phone with customer service."
2,Learned very little,"I was looking forward to this book after reading so many rave reviews. I was greatly disappointed.The book is mostly common sense, seems to rely more on opinion than on research/science, and is written at about an 8th grade level.If you have an education beyond a high school diploma or have read even a few parenting articles here and there, don't bother with this book."
4,Boys aren't rats,"Did you know that mother rats frequently lick the genitals of their male babies, and this helps their brains become fully male? Just one of the many titbits I picked up from this interesting and helpful little book. It's not a work of genius. Much of what Steve Biddulph has to say is plain common sense. But if, like me, you're looking for ways to be a better parent to a clutch of high-octane, high-powered pre-school boys you might find it a useful and easy-to-read starting point. Oh, and Biddulph doesn't recommend the rat thing, by the way. You'll be pleased to learn that only works for rodents."
2,Flabbergasted,"That describes my reaction to this book. It came HIGHLY recommended to me, but I was shocked at how much of it is just common sense. Like, love your son, duh. And make sure he has male role models in his life, duh. I've read close to 50 parenting books in the past 2 years and this is easily in the bottom 3. I guess if you are a single parent or didn't have good parenting role models growing up, you might find some of this information helpful. But honestly, if you are in tuned enough to your child's life to be reading parenting books, you don't need this book."
2,I've gotta disagree.,"I purchased this title because so many people just raved and gushed over it. This book is daddy-centric. I'm a single mom and I don't discount the importance of having a good dad around, but this book really did not help me to understand my son or his behavior all that well... it just told me to find him some men to hang around with. Also, it did that by adding unnecessary -and annoying- exclamation points all over the place (!). I'm all for exclamation points, but they really don't need to be placed everywhere!"
4,really good,"The book is good, simple though, it helped me understand what is happening with my boy but I wish it had more details.MY child is only 16 months and it is only a few pages that cover early childhood, I think it works better to understand boy who are preteen and teen."
3,"In general, informative but some dubiousness","In general, it is quite informative, and as my sons get older, I expect that there will be a fair bit of truth to them. However, some of the conclusion to the studies may be accurate but the source data seems rather limited to really draw the conclusions. For example, the [paraphrasing] ""extensive study...of three boys in the UK over 15 years"" leaves a bit to be desired. I absolutely agree that girls are very different from boys and they need to be treated and taught differently, but that's true about different boys AND different girls.A good read, and I would recommend it to a father and mother of boys (especially mothers of only boys). I will have my wife read it. Cheers."
4,Informative Read,I read this book some time ago. I found it very informative and an interesting take on raising boys. I think the take on boys needing lots of time with their dads is an important message. The old-school way of being the financier more than the father is not the best format for raising well-rounded boys. I changed my own interaction with my son and have tried to be less of a nag. I realized how much I was doing that without finding the positive moments to praise my boy. It is a worthwhile read and I will return to it often as my son gets older.
3,Not quite up to the press. . ..,"I much prefered ""Raising Cain"" over this book. There was no real new information, and little advice worth noting."
3,Disappointed,This book is not as helpful as I hoped it would be. It did have a few good points but for the most part it was common sense stuff I already knew. I would'nt recommend it. I have read quite a few parenting books & this one was'nt as good as others I've read.
2,Not worth the money,"I bought this book after having my son and because I am an elementary school teacher. I do agree it is easy to read however much of it IS common sense and quite frankly some of the statements turned me off a bit. I almost quit reading the book after the first few pages. For example, the author says boys should NOT be in daycare for the first three years of their lives. I think many working parents, like myself, would find that remark a bit preachy and generalized. I think I know kids pretty well having taught for many years and some of what the author writes had me going, ""Whaaaat? That's crazy?!"" I should have just saved the money and checked it out at the library instead."
2,Waist of time,"The sections on toddler boys were good, but it deteriorated from there into Biddulph suggesting that parents shop for ""good"" porn for their 14 year old boys! Thanks, Steve! Good advice. I guess you never heard how Prince's (the artist formerly known as Prince) mother did that. Look how good he turned out, right?"
4,A Mixed Review,"In general, I enjoyed this book. It is well written and an easy read (you could probably get through it in one evening). I especially liked the delightful little drawings. I agreed with much of what the author was saying. Although we try and do the best we can and be balanced in our parenting, we cannot change the fact that boys and girls are different. What we need to do is to embrace those differences and work with them.I just found the book to fall a little short in that much of it was common sense, and the author made many statements on what boys need, yet did not give suggestions on how to bring that about. Also, the author quotes many Australian stories, studies, examples, etc., which is fine if your Australian. I was hoping to relate to the stories a bit more.Overall, not a very useful book, but enjoyable to read nonetheless."
5,Statlers Short Stories,"My original copy was stolen along with my truck 20 years ago, so I was happy to find a copy on Amazon. Some great songs I haven't heard in a long while."
1,Definitely Flat,"Most of the stories in this book totally missed with me, each for a different reason. Many were too boring, of a different ""aesthetic"" than what I prefer, too distant from my own interests, or too self-indulgent, but in generally, it's the lack of sensuality that left me flat. Very little that is memorable in this book..."
4,No so bad,"Negative:Plastic cover,small USB jack is very fragile and not a standard one. Be carefull not to break it. Automatic funcions are the main defect.Positive:Price.You can change all values as if it was a manual camera. With it i managed to take a shot at night with no light or flash as if it was a nightscope. I could not do the same with a 400$ cannon. You can set values for exposure, shutter speed, white balance and ISO. If you know a little of photography you can take great pictures. Do not expect much from the automatic function. It is not a point and shoot camera.Menues are easy to use.I'm happy with it."
2,Focusing is not working well.,"I was shopping around a basic digital camera and encountered this product. At first sight, this camera looked great. It has 10Mpixel and all common features, yet a real bargain price tag. The user reviews I found on the web were mostly positive. But once I tried it, I have to say I was very unhappy. Quite simply, auto focusing works only under very bright conditions and this camera does not have manual focusing. When I tried to take pictures in my home under normal room light, auto focusing failed quite often and the images are terribly blur. I don't know if this is true for all of this model or specific to the unit I got, since nobody else has reported this kind of problem. I hope more people would post a review of this product which shed some light on the focusing performance."
5,LOVE this camera!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I love this camera. It is my second digital camera. My first was a kodak easy share and I liked that camera but the flash went out only after a couple years. It was going to cost almost as much as I paid for this one to get it fixed. This camera take very good pix! It has alot of settings which I love- Ex. beach & snow, Sunset, kids."
5,Best 10 Megapixel for $100,"Uses AA, so no expensive batteries to replace. Excellent pictures for such a small price. SD card, easily accessible and removable. I've taken mine around the world, no problems with it."
3,"Quite Good, Excellent Print.",Entertaining movie for fans of Hulk Hogan and Shannon Tweed. The action is thick and fast and the humor is supplied by Martin Kove. DVD print excellent. Buy It!
5,"A story of emotional transformation, hope, and forgiveness","All These Girls by Ellen Slezak is the story of a bond between a young woman and aunts. Candy Golden has lost her mother, and quit her high school basketball team in the wake of accusations of having sex with her coach. Her Grandaunt Gloria struggles to help Candy straighten out and reclaim the energy to return to the basketball court, while her other, more distant aunt Elizabeth reluctantly comes along in what is meant to be a rejuvenating trip. Yet the travel goes off-course, and places the three of them in a remote locale, confronted by characters that will make them re-examine who they all are and what they are striving for in life. A story of emotional transformation, hope, and forgiveness in troubled times."
1,Boredom and Bliss / An Exercise in Vanity,"While sitting at an airport waiting for a flight I found this book discarded and starting reading out of boredom. Well boredom should be part of the book title - as in Boredom and Bliss.The author writes in a shallow and clichéd style and seems to have modeled his storyline with the same depth as one of those 4th rate late night TV movies.The book does seem to prove that anyone can get published. Possibly the author guaranteed enough advance sales that it was published. You get the sick feeling that his family all received an autographed copy for Christmas. That is where the vanity comes from, writing a book to satisfy your ego. You suspect that he would send out congratulatory messages to himself."
4,Her favourite bug,Our daughter didn't like it until 4 months...now she loves it! It is soft/comfy...but make sure your infant does not roll off onto a harder floor surface (put it on a mat). The dangling toys are fun.
2,Not that great,"I purchased this product based on a review for people looking for great products for limp, fine hair. Unfortunately, I'm afflicted with the fine hair. While secretly I'd hoped to have a head of hair resembling that of a lion's mane, it didn't happen. The cost of shipping $8 is outrageous, try a padded envelope and cutting your costs. The product is $34 and not worth the money. Your hair feels nice, the smell is nice, but no detectable increase in volume perception of hair. Your hair dresser can sell you something that would probably work as well and not cost as much. I won't be purchasing again. The Rusk products for fine hair work better and cost a lot less."
1,Not good,"Not worth the money, not worth the outrageous shipping charges. Nice smell. Other products that work better or as well can be had at a better price."
5,Money?!?!,"Tabetha finally has a husband that appreciates her and treats her good--and life could not be better--or could it? Gilbert, her current husband wants a child of his own, since he has practically raised her teenage son. But Tabetha's career is going great and she doesn't want to interrupt it to have a baby. Tabetha and Gilbert are trying to work out their marital problems. Then, her first husband, Marlon, who jilted her and her son years ago, is now a proclaimed millionaire and has returned to get his family back--at whatever the cost. To make matters worse, Gilbert's ex-con sister is causing money problems for the couple and Tabetha's son is disrespecting Gilbert. Distrust and ulterior motives abound. Life is full of everyday situations that only money can fix! So, is the grass really greener on the other side? Earl Sewell writes a very realistic life situation."
5,Attention Getter,"This book was so good that I had to pull myself away from reading it and hated when it ended. That Veronica and Marlon were something else. I wanted to jump in the book and whip their you-know-what myself. Veronica was one heartless woman and there are no words to explain Marlon.If you have not picked up this book, run and do it. You won't be disappointed."
4,RADL,TIENEN DEMASIADOS ITEMS EN LA PAGINA LO QUE HACE DIFICIL ENTENDERLA ADEMAS DE BOMBARDEAR DE ICONOS RESALTADORES POR TODAS PARTES CON EL FIN DE QUE SEAN LLAMATIVOS PERO DISTRAE AL USUARIO DE LA PAGINA EN CUESTION DE LO QUE BUSCA.
3,Not enough detail on a month-by-month basis,"I have 2 children, ages 5&6, and now I'm pregnant with my third. I thought I'd get a book to give me a little refresher. With my first 2 pregnancies, I consulted ""What to Expect When You're Expecting"" on an almost daily basis. This time, I thought I'd try something different. I should have stuck with ""What to Expect"". I really prefer the month-by-month organization. ""The Unofficial Guide"" has one chapter for each trimester, with very little description of the development of the baby. There is a real lack of illustration, just a dozen or so line drawings. I prefer a book that includes realistic pictures of the unborn baby, and of the pregnant mother. Although there is some helpful, accurate information, it's just not organized to create a pleasurable reading experience."
5,Great buy!,So so so glad I bought this book! Very informative and answered not only the questions I had but had tons of info on stuf I had never even heard of! Love this book!
4,Awesome Book!,"Book is a must have. It is much better than some of the other information books on the market, and it gives much more detail into more common aspects of a woman's pregnancy. Would highly recommend this product!"
3,A mile wide and an inch deep.,"Not a bad primer on pregnancy. Covers absolutely everything but covers nothing particularly well. But most importantly this book is for women only! I found the book rife with subtle feminist male-bashing. ""Don't be surprised if your partner is less than enthusiastic about attending childbirth classes. For whatever reason the average father-to-be finds childbirth classes to be about as fulfilling and exciting as a typical bridal shower."" I was reading this book because I WAS taking an interest and I didn't deserve this sort of insult."
4,"Great, practical information that won't scare you.","I like this book a lot and find that it has almost everything you need to know. I especially like the fact that it doesn't scare you but instead gives you matter of fact information and quotes from ""real live"" pregnant women. I would advise people to get this book when they start trying to get pregnant because it also covers fertility. Many women I know waste a lot of valuable time with doctors that are not really fertility specialists and it is great to get any information that you can."
3,The Unofficial Guide should be the spartan guide,"If I had known that 1/2 the book would be focused on special pregnancy circumstances, miscarriages, high risk pregnancy, carrying multiples, and infertility, I would not have bought the book. If you are having a normal pregnancy like me than reading the 3 chapters on what happens during the 3 trimesters left me finished with the book in one hour and wanting more information. The girlfriends guide is a better book, touching upon what a woman goes through.If you want a book which touches a bit on every combination and aspect of pregnancy, than this is for you. But if you are having a normal pregnancy and want more detailed information on what your body is going through than I would recommend another book"
3,"OK, nothing I hadn't read/heard before","I was disappointed in this book. Everything in it I had either read or heard elsewhere. Also, I was already pregnant when I bought it, so the large section on preconception wasn't of any use to me. I found the text dry, and it doesn't go into much depth on the medical information.My favorite pregnancy book is ""The Girlfriend's Guide"". I was hoping to suppliment that book with one a little more factual and informative, but ""The Unofficial Guide..."" is not what I was looking for."
3,"Eh, it was okay.","Basically, I found that this book and ""The Mother of all Pregnancy Books"" were VERY similar, so I suggest in comparing the two to see which one would be better for what you're looking for.I found the writing pretty dry, although it did provide some good information. However, it was all information that could probably be heard or read elsewhere, probably with more focus. It seemed to try and touch on ALL the subject of pregnancy (which makes sense, considering the title) but only briefly.I wasn't totally disappointed in this book, but I wish the writing were a little more enjoyable."
4,great pregnancy book :),"this book is very informative about before, during, and after pregnancy. an excellent source providing info on pregnancy and what to expect, what to look forward to and how to handle certain situations. I love this book, this is my second time around and i still had questions like this was my first and it answered alot of them. great book to have when you are in doubt."
5,Great Resource! Great Gift! No book for Dummies...,"I just bought this book for 2 friends of mine that are currently pregnant (based on another friend's recommendation). I have heard positive feedback from both of them - saying it's both a factual book and addresses many of the issues that they cannot find in other pregnancy books - and not in a ""doom and gloom"" format. It is unfortunate that the reader in New York did not like the book because I have not heard these sentiments from anyone else that has read the book."
5,The Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby,"I was very pleased with this book. Even though I'm in the preconception stage, I read the book cover to cover, and I found it very useful and interesting. Even though the preconception and fertility sections are relatively brief, they are very concise. The book also answered many of my questions about the later stages in a very clear way. I highly recommend this book."
4,"Good but very similar to ""Mother of all Pregnancy""","I bought this book after finding out I was pregnant. I had already bought and read ""The mother of all pregnancy books"" and I loved her style of writing so I thought I would get this one as well. Surely it would have some different information? Not really, a lot of the quotes from the mothers and fathers are used in both books and even some of the writing seems to be almost exact.This is a GREAT book, it has pretty much all you'll need unless you have a special pregnancy that requires more specific books. But just know that you dont need this and ""The mother of all pregnancy books"""
3,not just another chic lit book,"I almost passed this book by because I took it for yet another dreary chic lit Bridget Jones imitation but I was facing a long train ride and really wanted something light and breezy to read so I bought it. Lucky me. The heroine is very well written. She's not dumb, or pitiful and she actually grows up and discovers that having isn't always as satisfying as wanting. The villainess of the book, Pepper is suitably nasty and the New York scenes are all mostly funny. I had two small nit picks though. Spence, the love interest falls flat when he finally makes his adult appearance and the the apparently prerequisite strained mother/daughter relationship thing has been done to death. Just once in a chic lit book I'd like to see a heroine who has a reasonably healthy relationship with her parents.Anyway, the book is a very amusing way to spend a few hours."
4,Awesome book! Don't be swayed by the title!,"Alison Bell is anything but ordinary. Down on her luck, she is forced to take a job as a nanny working for former classmate and boyfriend stealer, Pepper. While working as the Smith's Nanny, Alison develops a special relationship with their daughter August and with her former boyfriend Spence who is now Pepper's husband! After a move to New York City, the story really starts to pick up and show its true colors. What unravels is an intricate story full of past grudges, past and present loves and the desire to be accepted. A charming, light-hearted read for any woman!"
1,NOT what I expected,"Alison is a doormat. I didn't find the characters well developed; Alison was not particularly likeable. This one was a waste of time, I'm afraid."
4,Great!!!!,"This book was fun to read! In the beginning, I wasn't sure whether or not to like Alison's character, but she is definitely one that I laughed at, cried for, and had that warm fuzzy feeling for...a VERY relatible character! The author did a fantastic job creating scenes and characters that you could picture! Very well written!"
3,It was okay,"This book was funny at times and at other times, I could not believe the main character did some of the things she did. She was a doormat and I can't relate to women allowing themselves to be treated that way. So, I gave it only 3 stars for that reason."
5,Great addition to the chic lit collection!,"I love this book! It is very entertaining and it will keep you amused throughout the whole book. The characters are so fresh and they will make you want to jump in the book and yell at them sometimes. If you love humorous chic lit, you will LOVE this book. Highly recommended!"
1,"Awful book, awful idea","I hated this book. I kept reading, hoping to have that ""aha"" moment where I finally put all the pieces together... but there was not one. I did not think there was anything remarkable about Alison, and I never really liked her. She was wishy-washy, spineless, and settled way too many times during the story. I felt so sorry for every character in the book.... except for Alison's friends.. Nola and Jess - who were poorly developed. I found myself flipping back pages/chapters to see if I'd missed something about these random people. The middle part of the story dragged on and on.... and then in a matter of one or two chapters.. everything was resolved ... but I still felt unresolved since the resolutions were so weak."
5,Up there with the best,"Before you condemn comic books, you must read Sandman.Even my mother likes this series! As for me, I thinkWorlds' End is one of the best of the Sandman storyarcs (closely rivalled by Brief Lives) simply becausethe characters are so extraordinary - and yet so human.From the envoy of the fairies to a girl masquerading asa boy in the last days before the steamship, everyprotagonist in this collection of tales is engagingbeyond superficial levels. The artwork is as varied anddelightful as the stories themselves. Newcomers toSandman may find this collection somewhat harder goingthan the others; Worlds' End is rather more abstract inmaking its point than are the other collections. Definitely,however, worth reading."
4,What may seem to be a series of short stories is actually a set-up for something important to come..,"While some readers may believe Worlds' End may not be as entertaining as other volumes because Dream and the Endless are only briefly shown, Gaiman spins another yarn of a tale and what may not seem to be about Dream actually is.A large collection of characters from different worlds are drawn together at a tavern called Worlds' End. A large ""reality"" storm brings these travelers together to the tavern, where the many different characters tell tales to pass the time. These tales include ""a swashbuckling adventure, a sea story, a gangster story, a grisly boys' funeral story, and even a little ghost story."" Each of these tales is unique and a splendid read, but the funeral at the end is big (and explains the reality storm), and it is clear Gaiman has drastically changed the Sandman series and is setting up the reader for a monumental volume to follow."
2,The worst entry in the series.,"This is the only volume in The Sandman series that I actually had to force myself to finish. Although ""Worlds' End"" includes some foreshadowing to the far superior ""The Kindly Ones"", the story just doesn't seem to go anywhere. Needless to say, earlier volumes that focused on minor/supporting characters were far more successful."
3,One of the least successful of the series,"Rather than a continuous narrative, this volume is a collection of short pieces with distinctly different artistic treatments. The frame story is that there's an inn just outside space and time, where travelers just might find themselves marooned for awhile when a reality story hits. There not being much else to do, they take turns telling stories, Canterbury-style. Some, like ""Cluracan's Tale"" and ""The Golden Boy,"" are quite good. Others, like ""Hob's Leviathan,"" are just kind of pointless. For me, this is one of the less satisfying entries in an excellent series."
3,Very average,"I did not order this CD set from Amazon. I got it for less than $10 (incl. S&H) from an outside vendor. There are three disc to this set; the first and third disc are strictly instumental, the second disc has male vocals - all the same guy. The style is very traditional and it sounds a lot alike after a while. The songs are all at a medium to fast speed. The second disc stays pretty much at a medium speed. I do not consider the money I spent, wasted, but I would not pay full price for it. The set is too monotone for that. It will make a good background CD at low volume, if you enjoy traditional, middle eastern music. It will also work for you, if you are looking for traditional, instrumental music to perform to. Unfortunately, you can't listen to samples here, but I found samples to listen to on the German sales site."
3,"OK, but not great","I got this game pad because of it's wireless features and the number of buttons\controls. Overall it's not too bad. I love the wireless aspect of it, and the button layout and overall feel was very nice. Sadly, it lacks accuracy for both the digital pad and analog sticks. It takes a great deal of effort to hit the horizontal and vertical points dead on. So when you want to go left, you go left and up. Very annoying."
5,Great gamepad!,"This is my second Logitech Rumblepad. The first one I bought many years ago when it was first released. It has been the best at all EA Sports titles and racing games. I had to purchase a new gamepad because I spilled something sticky by one of the buttons, so it doesn't always pop back up when pressed.Its hard to find these now because Logitech has introduced a new Rumblepad but it only has 4 buttons on the top and I'm used to the old model which has 6."
3,Dead Stick,"Yup, the left analag stick failed for me too - which now causes my character to run left at random times while playing GTA. Up until that it was a great pad. Weight is not an issue, the batteries lasted long enough, and the number of buttons and triggers was perfect for GTA. As much as I like this gamepad, I might search for something more reliable than get burned for another $50"
1,DO NOT BUY,"This product is useless, as hundreds of people can tell you if you google search for calibration problems. The pad has a hardware problem which causes the left analog stick to break after a few minutes of use. You have to unplug it and plug it back in every few minutes to recalibrate the stick. Logitech refuses to fix it, so DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT"
1,Keep looking for a different gamepad,"I've just spent the last 3 hours trying to get this gamepad to work with either Jedi Knight II or Ghost Recon. The gamepad is nice in appearance, looks like lots of features, and feels like a good grip, but watch out! The software is useless. I bought this as a programmable gamepad for Ghost Recon (which doesn't allow you to set up a controller inside the game)...and I can't get most of the buttons to work right with the game. I tried using it with Jedi Knight II, which does allow game controller setup inside the game, and I couldn't get both analog sticks to work with the game (aka using the left stick to move and the right stick to look around/aim). In short: the software is unreliable and also difficult to use, and the most non-flight games don't really support two stick gamepads (aka 4 axises)."
2,More is less,"The program is slow and tedious,and seems to concentrate more on games and videos than on teaching the language. It's extremely complicated to follow, and the only thing I've gained any useable information from are the vocbulary CDs, and you can get those with many other, far less expensive programs. Few people are going to sit by their copmputer waiting for videos to load so they can take a multiple choice test, which seemed to be a large part of the practice. I got more out of ""The Complete Idiot's Guide to Learning Italian."""
2,Blast from the past--and an unpleasant one at that,"My mother gave me this as a Christmas present way back when I was early in my high school career. She obviously had not read this book. She knew that I liked sports--including football. That must be why she purchased this for me as a Christmas gift.Unhappily, this was a book about a broken down former football player (who had performance problems, hence the title ""Footsteps""). The coach was a jerk. He used his football players as if they were there to fulfill his own aspirations. One key player had suffered injuries--but the coach tried to get him into a crucial game. A symptom of the ""win at any cost"" philosophy.In addition, the coach led a seemingly very nice young woman astray, conning her for his own pleasure.Altogether, a novel that distressed me many years ago-and distresses me still. . . ."
3,Home Recordings Part 2,"This CD features Elvis and his pals singing at home, recorded on a home tape recorder. The sound quality is poor, but listenable. Accompaniment is generally limited to either piano or guitar. We get to hear Elvis and friends having fun singing and goofing around. These are not professional performances, but it is fun to hear for an Elvis fan. Many of these songs would have made great records if they had been professionally recorded (and some of them were). There are a few songs here that are different from the rest. ""Fools Rush In"" and ""It's a Sin to Tell a Lie"" feature Elvis singing along to a schmaltzy instrumental ""sing along at home"" album that I can't identify. ""Blowin' in the Wind"" and ""500 Miles"" feature Elvis and friends singing along toSing a Song With the Kingston Trio. I can't give an unqualified recommendation to this album, based on the poor sound quality. But Elvis fans with forgiving ears should enjoy this CD."
5,WHOA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I used to listen to this album when I was in High School (on vinyl!!) and just resurrected it on CD from my 'pile of discs'. This album simply rocks the doors off the house!! This is one of those rare times when everyone in a band simply synched.
3,It rocks.,"Rainbow does rock, but their music just gets old too quickly. Gates of Babylon is the highlight point of the cd."
4,Great album,"Last Rainbow album in the classic line-up and therefore a must have for Rainbow fans. I think Rainbow Rising is still there best recording, but this one has some great songs as well. I have the original LP and the production of the record is a bit ""light"". The remastered CD sounds a lot better, the only thing missing is some bonustracks."
5,Great album!,"I love this album. It has it all, great songs, great musicans and more. I think this one is better then Rainbows ""Rising"". Great to finish the album with the slow and beutiful song ""Rainbow Eyes"". After I heard the song ""Long live rock n roll"" at a friends place I know I must have this album, so I bought it the day after."
5,Blackmore rules!,"This one has it all: Amazing musicianship, great songwriting, excellent production. Blackmore is by far the best guitar player on earth. Dio is by far the best singer on earth. If you love hard rock, you must have this one. I also recommend ""Rising"". Too bad I can't give it 6 stars. Only 3 or 4 in the world would make it, and this is one of them. And if you want another great tip on an amazingly heavy and beautiful album, listen to Queen II."
5,One Of Rainbow's Three Best Studio CDs,"LONG LIVE ROCK 'N' ROLL is, along with STRAIGHT BETWEEN THE EYES and BENT OUT OF SHAPE, one of Rainbow's three best studio CDs. Lead singer Ronnie Dio would leave immediately afterwards, but here he's singing like he could have gone on forever in the band. On this album, he sheds some of his medeival fantasies for a title track that says that rock & roll will never die no matter what people may try to do to it. If you get this CD, STRAIGHT BETWEEN THE EYES, BENT OUT OF SHAPE, and the double-disc anthology, you'll have the ultimate Rainbow library."
4,Guaranteed to upset those who dont want this cult Exposed!,"A Well written page turner with excellent research and source material! I found the book to be VERY provocative in the way that it brings to light the TRUTH behind the lies! Modern day ""Pagans"" are NOT the harmless ""tree huggers"" that ther propagandists would have you to believe! Think for yourself! PLEASE read this book with an open mind and learn the reality behind the facade."
1,Hmm...,"Man, this book is awful. Wiccans have told people like him that we DO NOT believe in Satan, let alone worship him. He claims to have been a Wiccan priest at some point, but he describes a religion that have no connection with Wicca. I must admit that yes, there are morons in this world who use thier powers for harm, but those people belong to a different faith!"
1,It was a good laugh.,"This book, I thought, was excellent for a good laugh. I have been a practicing Wiccan Witch (Eclectic) for over 6 years now. A friend loaned me this book to read, and in the first thirty pages, I was able to write 2 pages worth of mistakes. He mixes up a lot of terms, only tells the reader portions of certain rituals, etc etc. He also claims to have been so many things . . . Alexandrian High Priest, Craft of the Wise high priest, Druidic High Priest, Minister, Satan worshipper . . . and all in only 50 years? Doubtful. Also, from reading his other books, it is apparent the man is a psycho. Can you really trust a man that believes aleins to be part of Satan's mastermind in creating babies with his ""fallen angels""? I don't think so. Not to mention the book is from Chick publishing . . .~Path"
1,How sad.,"This book and the author are perfect examples of Christian Extremism. Garbage, and it was terribly researched."
1,seriously?,Epic FAIL!! Total crap. Each page filled with complete rubbish. Don't waste good money on such garbage!
3,"Interesting, Albeit Hard to Swallow","I found the book overall helpful. True, some of the stuff he says seems absolutely hard to believe, but it was a good read none the less. It must be left up to the individual reader to make up their own mind regarding it, since it is impossible to verify the author's personal experience. He claims to have a been in the highest circles of Satanism and Wiccanism, and tells of sorts of fantastical stories"
1,I wish I could give this no stars.,"I haven't read this book but I'm not going to waste my money on some ignorant literary work. I am a practicing Wiccan and have been for ten years. I fail to see how we, Wiccans/Pagans, could worship a being that is not of our beliefs. We do NOT believe in a being even like Satan really. Satan is creation of Christianity. Now, mind you, Paganism has been around MUCH longer than Christianity! Wicca is just a branch of Paganism just like Catholicism is a branch of Christianity. It's amazing how some people will be so quick to judge and make that judgment based off of ignorance. I have read the bible and I have also noticed that that's more than most Christians do. Instead blind faith is much easier to manage therefore; this doesn't surprise me in the least. Although, I could have sworn that people may be judged upon 'God' and no other in Christianity. But then again, what would a Wiccan know..."
1,Once again ANOTHER Christian Just NOT Understanding,"For anyone to say Wicca is that of Satan is totally wrong!!! I raise my chidren in the religion along with thousands and thousands of others, and believe me my children are far better then alot of their ""christian"" friends. Before Anyone writes a book on any subject they need to THINK I feel here he is Just Another single minded person, Preaching on something he trully knows nothing about!!! He is full of lies and Total Mis-Truths!!!"
1,"The Burning Times are over, people!!","Hmmm ... I nearly vomited after reading the first pages of this book. Not because what was in it was true, but because the author CLEARLY has a vendetta against anyone/anything that isn't Christian. The ""Prime Directive"" of the Wiccan religion (the Wiccan Rede) states, ""And it harm none, do what you will."" This means, ""do no harm."" DO NO HARM (I THINK that's the first line of the Hippocratic Oath, too). This book is just so full of lies that under different circumstances, it'd be funny."
1,Pretty much it's an insult from a fool.,"I love how other faiths seem to like to throw stones at poor little witch craft. It's quite a shame and feel sorry for any one that is so narrow minded that they can not be accepting of the lives of others. Here's a hint. Live your life but open up your mind to the fact that maybe your beliefs aren't right. If your faith can't stand scrutinization than perhaps you should be asking questions to build your faith don't just insult and label others for their ideals, or basically you're just another hater with out anything better to do."
1,Schnoebelen's Little White Lie.,This book and its author lack any creditability. Anyone with even an elementary knowledge of Wicca and the New Age can easily tell that My Schnoebelen has no idea what he is talking about. If you want to learn about Wicca read a book written by a wiccan. Its only common sense. One wouldnt expect to read a book about Christianity written by a Wiccan author. The same is true for this.
2,I change my review,"After I read Mr. Shnoebelen's book ""Lucifer Dethroned"" I have to change my review of this book. Shnoebelen claimes to have been an Alexandrian Wiccan, Thelemite, Druid, a member of TWO OTOs a Scottish, York, and Egyptian Rite mason (The Egyptian rite doesn't exist anymore) a Palladium mason (never existed)and illuminati member (never existed). In this book he failed to mention he was a spiritist church minister, a BISHOP in both the Old Catholic Church AND The Roman Catholic Church while being a high grade witch and satanist!For some reason he recalls it later in Lucifer Dethroned. I found most of the material in ""Lucifer Dethroned"" impossible to swallow, needless to say. The only practical reason for buying ""Wicca Satan's Little White Lie"" is the material he lifts from ""Crafting the Art of Wicca"", which has been out of print for years. So, take the book with a grain of salt."
1,Ignorance Knows No Bounds,"To say that this book is based on ignorance is like saying the Crusades were based on ignorance...anyone with any inkling of intellect and common sense should be able to see through the half-truths and out-right fallacious arguments that the author used to support this book to his ultimate goal: hate. The book is poorly written, based on information that has long been rendered irrelevant (since, say the 1800s), and is mostly just propaganda and hate mongering. Much like the Young Earth Creationists, this author and the individuals he represents should be viewed as the Christian equivalent of Al Qaeda...dangerous extremists who sole purpose in life is to hurt others. If you buy this book, make sure you get a couple extra matches, the cover is particularly resistant to flames."
2,The Truth is out there......,And this is not it. Although I will give the author credit for supplying me with a good laugh. All his arguments are backed up by speculative thoughts that he passes off as fact. If you want a good book on paganism and/or wicca select another author. If you would like a good laugh and example of how not to structure an argument...read this book.
1,This is Hate Literature,"This is hate literature. It is a scurrilous, uninformed attack against a gentle, legitimate, recognized religion. Wiccans follow the Wiccan Rede, which says ""An it harm none, do what ye will."" In other words, harm no one. It is all right to defend yourself or someone else, but even then harm should be kept to a necessary minimum. Anyone familiar with Wicca knows this to be the case, both in books and in practice. The purpose of this book is to keep people from investigating the religion on their own. Wiccans do not write tracts warning people to stay away from hate-filled fundamentalist cults. We let people make their own decisions and do not lie to them or put out filthy propaganda. Amazon should remove this book from their online shelves, as they would remove anti-semitic books."
2,Not the NEW Lego Friends,"My daughter wanted a computer game for Christmas and since she loves Lego Friends I thought she would enjoy this CD. This is not the NEW Lego Friends. This is a CD that was created in the 1990's and is now out so you think it is the NEW Lego Friends. The one character (that they happen to mention) is named the same, but the others are not! She was very disappointed."
2,friends.....,"this was not what i thought it was. i thought i was buying lego's, but it was a dvd.need to send it back"
4,Abundant Suspense,"Sherri Neilson's exceptional new book ""Free Falling"" is a must read. Cover-to-cover suspense and many surprise twists captivate, as the author takes you on a historical yet unpredictable journey. Her extraordinary talent leaves the reader hoping for a sequel."
4,"Good deal, albiet an outdated version","Great price, good quality. I didn't read close enough to realize that this version of the book was published in 2002 which makes it a bit outdated. However it's a good book, very educational and it was in good shape for the price I paid. Shipping was a little slow, but not terrible."
4,Classic Woodstock Era,"If you lived through the late sixties, you'll recognize this as raw blue-eyed soul. The acoustic guitar work and the raspy raw voice of Terry Reid cuts to the chase. Do yourself a favor and dig it dude."
5,Great Juicer,The best juicer I've ever used. Brings Kitchenaid quality to a product that can be anything but with other brands. Easy to clean up and especially quiet!
3,"Works Well, But Very Dainty","I purchased this Kitchenaid juicer almost two years ago. Through normal wear and tear, I had to send the first juicer back on warranty after about six months. Although the replacement was quick and satisfactory, within a few months the new juicer had succumbed to many of the same problems and then some!First, this juicer is held together by little plastic pieces that can easily be broken when disassembling for cleaning. On both of the juicers that I've had the snaps on the citrus attacments have broke, the snaps that hold the spigot in place have snapped off, and now, on the one replaced by warranty, the base has even started to crack.Although none of the damage prevents me from using it, it's a major pain in the butt and requires some extra manuvering. Given the large asking price for this juicer, I would look elsewhere to prevent the hassle."
5,"Carrots are not a problem either, the pulp makes fantastic carrot bread.","Clean up is messy no matter which machine you buy: I found that if I turn the basket upside down to soak in water for awhile, it helps make for easier clean up. I also saved the cylindrical piece of foam packing that fits over the spindle, and hold that tightly in place when I rinse water thru the machine. The piece of foam keeps excessive water from flowing into the motor housing and allows quick-easy clean up. KitchenAide does make excellent, durable products; quiet and dependable. The only thing that would make this perfect for the gallon juicers would be a pulp extractor port, otherwise for someone like me who just makes a quart of juice at a time, this is not a problem. The pulp that is left behind is moist, not juicy, and to my understanding the only way to get dry pulp is to purchase a very expensive masticating juicer."
2,JUST A JUICER BUT NOT A CITRUS PRESS,"I RECEIVED QUICKLY BUT DON'T HAVE ANY CITRUS PRESS, I'TS HARD TO USE IT AND THE QUALITY NOT TOO GOOD."
5,PATTI'S MULTIMILLION SELLERS ON ONE CD,Twelve of the biggest hits of the 50s on one CD!!! All by the same artist!! Patti had at least 23 Top 10 hits in the 50s which must have made it difficult for Mercury to choose 12 to showcase her best. From Patti's first million seller WITH MY EYES WIDE OPEN through her biggest hit TENNESSEE WALTZ(over 10 million) right up through the later 50s million sellers OLD CAPE CODE and ALLEGHENY MOON. If what you want are her 12 best known songs in their original 50s glory this is it.
2,Ron,"There is a problem with this web-page. The songs listed are not all on this CD... I was disappointed. Neither 'Cross Over the Bridge' nor 'Old Cape Cod', or 'Allegheny Moon' are on this CD. If you want those songs, buy another CD. Otherwise, the CD has some good songs, and all are originals of Patti's from the 50's."
5,one click order right now !,Few artist have ever had an impact on me like Nanci. While her last few albums have been week and overproduced its albums like this and Little Love Affairs that show Nanci at her peak. Great songs and an honest classic production. So if your not familiar with this album then hurry and treat yourself to a real must have. And unlike vinyl you can listen to it for years (I Have) and CD's won't wear out.
4,Sweet Sweet Songs,"I really enjoy listening to this singer. On this CD there are some exceptionally sentimental, sweet songs like ""Love At The Five And Dime"" and ""More Than A Whisper."" The latter is my favorite track on the CD: I hear feminine strength pushing through the sentimentality. Very charming. Some of the tracks are straight forward country and western music, like ""Lookin' For The Time"" which are not special to me. But I like these tracks too, they are mostly excellent for what they are."
5,Classic Nancy Griffith,"First album I heard and her stories, unique voice - caught me right away . Deemed the queen of folkabilly: combo of country / bluegrass/ folk music - some poignant and sad , some fun, some political , some social commentary ( Left leaning lIberal which is fine by me) . Definitely on of her best albums !!"
5,I wish I give this album 10 stars,If you have any interest in Nanci Griffith you must own this record. It is now on my 10 desert island disk list.
5,Read This Book,"Charles Spurgeon hits the nail on the head in this devotional. He speaks from experiance and encourages the reader to grow in their relationship in Christ, giving needed encouragement, advice,and examples along the way."
3,Morning and Evening devotions,Hard to understand at times. Maybe it needs to be up dated. Good information..What can you do to up date information?
2,Old English,"Unfortunately, the text is in the Old English style that I find difficult to read and difficult to follow the thought. It is all there and likely accurately taken from the original, I just do not find it to be a relaxing read, I have to think too hard to switch words around in my mind to make it make sense. Spurgeon's Morning and Evening is truly a GREAT devotional, but I would highly recommend a more modern translation."
3,inspirational,Powerful thoughts and words to begin and end my day. Each reading referes to biblical teaching and relates it to today.
5,best devotional I ever found,"Outstanding, refreshing, constantly surprising work by a man who passionately loved Jesus Christ. His language, though slightly dated, is rich and fluid in metaphors; his thinking, deep and challenging. He is a modern-day ""Isaiah"" for believers"
3,Morning and Evening: Daily Bible Readings (Mobi),"Though Spurgeon's thoughts are great, this Kindle version is not. Many pages are incomplete. Always try a sample before you buy."
5,Kindle Version: A Good Deal?,"I have this book in both print and digital formats and have enjoyed it immensely. It's a great resource for anyone looking for a good start to their morning and evening devotionals. And I'm inspired by his story and ministry, especially how he didn't give up in the face of criticism for his plain speech.I, personally, do not dislike the digital version. There are minor errors in formatting, but they didn't distract me from the intent of the text. And, honestly, for $0.89, I don't think there's much room for complaints on these minor points. I also love being able to click on the ""Morning and Evening"" title and go directly to where I left off. It's even easier than the print version, and since I read so much anyway, there's no chance that I accidentally left my copy in my car or at the office. If nothing else, I could access it on my phone or computer if all else fails.This is an amazing buy for under a dollar."
3,Wording,Wording was too wordy but I realize the timeframe that this was written by Spurgeon a long time ago. Overall the content (meaning) was good
5,Morning and Evening - Spurgeon,"For over 50 years I have worn out many copies of this book by the Prince of Preachers, Charles H. Spurgeon. I never tire reading it 'moning and evening.'"
5,Love the modern language,"I have an older copy of Morning and Evening and love Spurgeon's writing. However, this updated version is easier to read and I love having it on my Kindle for easy access!"
4,Reading this devotional this year.,"It is the end of the year and I have just about finished this book. I have read tidbits of it over the years. It isn't my favorite devotional, but there is lots of meat to it. I'll read it again in a year or so."
1,Poor Quality,"I just downloaded this book to my Kindle; my husband downloaded this book to his Nook. The formatting on the Kindle is sub-par, there are no chapters; cannot navigate except page to page. The Nook edition is the same price but is formatted so much better with chapters for each day and with no extra spaces in the middle of words. Although I should not rate the book without reading it, I'm sure the content will be good; however, a heads-up for those who are particular with formatting (and I'm not!)."
2,No chapters!,"Can't complain much since it's just .99, but having no chapters or table of contents makes this book hard to navigate."
3,Works Great...Just Not for Long,"I really love this hairdryer, but I seem to have to replace them every six months or so. I take great care of them and clean the filter every day, but it starts shooting sparks and then the heating element goes."
4,I like it a lot,"I bought a Yellowbird at my salon about three years ago for a LOT more money. Recently the heating element went bad and it blew only cold air. While I was very disappointed that it lasted a relatively short time, I decided to buy another one just like it b/c when I tried others (even by conair) they seemed wimpy. This price is less than 1/3 what I originally paid for it. So I don't care too much if it goes in another three years. I've never had a better hairdryer!"
3,Heating Element,"Great product, probably one of the best for the price but beware.....you will replace this dryer due to a blown out heating element, every 6 months."
3,workable,I bought this because of it's power. It's difficult to find a hairdryer that has some power that's not over $75. The yellowbird is a little heavier than I'd like so your arms get tired fast. After about a year or so the off/on switch broke but after some manipulation I am able to get it working. I would probably buy another one because of it's power but it needs to be slightly lighter.
2,Had to return it...,"The hair dryer is very heavy. Also, while I like the yellow design of the dryer itself, the yellow cable makes this look rather like a home improvement tool."
3,Satyricon- Rebel Extravaganza,"As a somewhat new Satyricon fan who has been steadily working his way through their back catalog I find this transitional album to be good, but nowhere near the caliber of their more recent work like The Age of Nero, Now Diabolical or even Volcano.I think it's very much the work of a band in transition.It sounds like a band bored and a little frustrated with their previous traditional black metal albums like Nemisis Divina (a classic) but without a clear idea of where they wanted to go.I think they did eventually find a great sound with more focused, streamlined and still very heavy and black metal influenced albums like Age of Nero and Now Diabolical.Many long time fans with disagree with me but these later works are the band's best works to date.The version of this album I received also contained the Intermezzo EP and bought as a used CD was a great value.Ray"
1,Looks like a You Tube Bootleg,All footage (Except last 8 minutes) is on you tube and is better quality than on these dvd's. It would be a great resource if it offered superior quality to what is already out there for free.
2,not satisfactory,i've just had my dvd set. but i'm disappointed with it's resolution. i think it's not suitable especially for beginners.
5,Excellent Instruction Aikido Set by Master Saito,"I really like the presentation of the maneuvers, such as in the Jo, the maneuvers are the maneuvers that are part of the 13 and 31 Jo setsSensie Saito has one of the best understanding of Aikido, he presents them very wellA less experienced person might might some of the finer points that he is presenting, however they can learn on many level and advance with Saito as their skills improve"
2,Close to expiration date,"Product was of good quality, but expiration date was within about a month of when the product arrived. Be cautious about buying for your own pantry."
1,Doesn't work well,"I planted hot peppers in this, with fertilizer and watering regularly... the peppers that normally reach 3 or 4 inches were not even an inch long when they ripened. Not enough root space. Don't even get me started on the topsy turvey... let's just say plastic bags promote mold!"
4,OK for minor repairs that a novice can do in his home garage. Gave it four stars but only for those purposes.,"Don't assume that this is the ""bible"" for 2002 work, even though the car is very simple. OK for minor repairs that a novice can do in his home garage. I would not recommend using it for anything too technical such as inner engine or transmission work."
4,Excellent resource,Well worth the purchase if you have or will have a BMW 2002 to maintain and upgrade.
4,Old Faithful,"I got this old Page Murdock from Amazon. It is one of the early ones. As usual, a good quick read."
3,unexpected,"I did not realize that the DVD was in French Canadian with subtitles. I initially had seen this "" in English ""."
3,Good-hearted and good fun at times,"3.5 stars.An enjoyable little romp that could be 20 minutes shorter, but is worth watching.It does have subtitles, so you've been warned.The Quebec fishing village scenery is pleasant, the performances are all solid, the script quite funny at times, and the moral isn't banging you over the head every few minutes.This film does exactly what it sets out to do, and leaves you with a pleasant aftertaste. Add to that a few very funny moments, and it's worth watching some day."
5,Itten is a true master,"I'd studied physiology and neuroscience, later switching careers from a medical path to that of a designer. I've dived into many sources for my self-education/training. Itten is the grand-master of color; no other book I've read compares to those of Itten. His teachings have enlightened me in ways that I'm amazed by, touching on scientific, psychological, behavioral, and the most personal aspects of color as a study and an experience. It's changed the way I look at my environment, and it's changing the way I use color in my work as a designer.I'm so impressed with the value this book has had to me, that I bought Itten's book on Form and Design, even though I didn't necessarily feel lacking on those aspects of design. It's rather because of the likelihood in the quality and richenss of knowledge I'll gain, as I did from this book."
5,I WILL do it in spanish. Un libro de trabajo y experiencias,De gran informacion y de necesaria base de experimentacion para todos quienes quieren manejar el color con seguridad en base a uua experiencia sistematica que el autor nos hace llegar con un lenguaje claro y de profundo conocimiento.
3,CD rack needed bigger front feet,"This CD rack was exactly as represented, well made, and a reasonable value for the price. However, I needed to replace the front feet with larger wooden balls in order to prevent it from tipping forward on our carpeted floor."
3,Atlantic 100 Capacity CD Tower,"I was a little disappointed as I expected to be able to select my CD's more easily. Problem is, I cant see the titles very well. It's only for someone who can kneel down to find a particular CD, and has good eyesight. The plus is that it does keep the CD's neat."
2,too salty!,"this product is too salty, compared to the regular fri-chik. they must be compensating for the lower fat by adding more salt. i would rather have purchased the regular fri-chik!"
5,slice thin- heat- use in noodles- eat right out of the can,"excellent product- this is not the same as reg frichik- do not buy thinking it is- texture And taste is very different- but, both have their place in a veg kitchen- best of all- slice in half lengthwise- batter dip- deep fat frying- ahhhhhhh- not low fat now!"
5,Love it,These are great to use in stir fry or many other recipes. It is some what more healthy for you as well.
2,Worthington Low Fat FriChik,"I did not like the chewy,rubbery outer texture of the Fri Chik chunks...When I ordered them I thought they would be like the Loma Linda Fried Chik'n, which is soft on the outside as well as the inside...Now I am stuck with a product I do not like."
1,Beware! Not the same old FriChik,Please be aware that the 'Low Fat' variety of this product is NOT the same as the standard 'FriChik'. Whatever is removed to be able to sport the 'Low Fat' moniker makes a world of difference. Standard FriChiks are delicious while the 'Low Fat' variety are drier and less tasty (savory). I hope someone at Amazon will take notice and start offering the standard FriChik.
4,The best way to make Fri-Chik,"Okay, here is the best way to cook this stuff. Get some Nutritional Yeast or Brewer's Yeast. Coat the Fri-Chik in the yeast and fry. Mmmmmm Mmmmmmmm Good!"
4,Fri Chik's,"Still a great product but, I didn't realize they were ""low fat"". A little dryer and more 'compressed' than the ones I remember. Must be all that fat! :) Still tastes great, great price and fast shipping."
5,FriChik is a tasty meat replacement,We use frichik in casseroles with pasta or in egg foo yung patties with bean sprouts. It is also great alone and just heated through. FriChik is a versatile and tasty meat replacement. We have used it for over 40 years.
5,My Son Loves This Video,"My son loves this video and the others in the series. He knows the instruments by name and sound and loves to pretend he is playing along with all the instruments. It isn't my favorite video, but I have learned a thing or two from them."
2,Why Buy a Book With False Advertising?,"If you look at the other posts to this and other books that are similar, you will notice that the authors are 'fake' users or the publishers themselves. Ask yourself why must a publisher us such tactics to sell their item?In fact, when you go through to see other reviews from many of these people, you will notice there are no other reviews or they are of spam-like books. Quite frankly, do not purchase this book. Look for another source of information than one that relies on horrible marketing tactics.I only wish this could have helped me in my recording endeavors."
5,Simply The Best !!,101 Music Business Contracts is well worth the asking price and more. The time saved in energy and not to mention legal fees is priceless.
5,Useful resource for getting to know music industry contracts!,This resource provides a good selection of examples of recording contracts. Provided are a binder and a CD version. The set covers all sorts of professional contracts dealing with the music industry and is an informative look at the industry as a whole. This set has something for everyone and will allow for a well-rounded view of various contracts.
4,To help with additional studying,I liked this book because it gave additional tips on how to study and understand nursing care/process in pediatrics. I'm pleased with this product.
5,Quick and Easy,"This book covers the basics without weighing me down. However, I would suggest you DO NOT buy this book if you like slogging through a wordy textbook or need to know every... single... detail about a disease and it's processes. DO NOT buy this book if you like colorful pictures and intro pages that look like they were designed by Versace. DO BUY IF brevity and no-nonsense explanations are important to you. The only thing I didn't like about this book is that the end-of-chapter questions were so very simple it didn't really pose a challenge or any learning possibilities. If challenge questions with rationales interest you, I would suggest the Davis' Pediatric Success book by Richardson."
5,FRINGE 3 is here!!,"Altlivia is here, Olivia is over there. Can Peter save our world, and who is Henry?? These questions and more are answered (and some questions asked) in this season of FRINGE! LOYAL FAN, and whose side are you with?"
5,Absolutely best season.,"Love this series for the characters, but have to turn away from the graphic forensic gore. A frustrated love story intertwined with great science fiction."
4,Good Season,Was a very good season but the William Bell in Olivia line was not very good. Ready for season 4.
5,Continues to Surprise me!,"Just when you thought they might have a problem keeping up the amazing stories, they knock it out of the park all over again! It is like watching a baseball team that hits home runs every time at bat! They continue to stagger the story line so you have one theme happening one episode and then another picks up the next time and at times they both merge in one episode! This show should be considered required viewing for any writer or director! They are establishing the new paradigm for brilliance in television and it really is the only Oasis in the TV badlands! I hope these writers start their own school and re-educate Hollywood!"
5,Trying to follow fringe and quantum physics.,It allowed me to see the entire season in order. It also allowed me to refresh my memory on previous episodes as well as gain a new perspective on subsequent episodes.
3,Used Fringe Season 3,"Enjoyed fringe 3rd Season, bought used. Unfortunately the last episode had a defect and couldn't enjoy it. As I was watching all the episodes in order, I unfortunately threw away all the return things so by the time I reached the defective episode, I didn't know how to return it."
3,Bad Time line,The time line in this one made it confusing. Did Pete know Olivia and how did they forget about each other ?
5,Fringe,"Great show. It really is an entertaining and somewhat factual show. Just ask me, I have a Masters degree in Science."
5,3rd season fringe,good value for whole season picture is great streaming on the internet and very low lag was a great deal
4,Fringe is addicting!,My husband & I bought Fringe on a whim & it totally has sucked me in for the long haul! I have got to say that just when you think it can't get any weirder.......it does!!!
5,good stuff,it just keeps getting better. it helps to have seen the other seasons first.highly recommendend if u like sci fi
3,Lost in Harvard,"An action movie of a special investigation unit is more and more shifted into New York traditionally, leaving the Fringe headquarters in Boston for, perhaps, merely highlighting a mental link with and a lead of Harvard uni.A story more and more plunges in a mix of characters' personal affairs and pure fantasies to which Christian faith references add much more confusion as absurdity had been screened: a hostile parallel same-souls-inhabited world is a good twist for merely deploying a more popular cast team unable, probably, on a regular basis for shooting a ""this world"" story-line.Harvard professor Walter, in and out of a penal system-either a mental institution or a mere prison, exhibiting his boundless knowledge and hands-on expertise in everything is a more and more annoying character, and a next season ought to probably clarify an illogical mess and obvious mismatches found prior to a sit-com future-set release."
3,Third Season Blues,I love this show but the 3rd season just didn't seem as great to me as the season before. It felt like a lot of the storyline wasn't connecting.
5,Fringe,It was delivered in a timely manner and in great condition. I enjoyed watching every episode and will most definitely watch it again with the first two seasons I already own.
5,Fringe review,"It is hard to stop following Fringe if you have started to watch it. This season was a bit difficult to follow because of the alternate world and the similar characters on both sides. It was not always so easy to notice the different hairstyles or clothing that these characters wore in different worlds.However, this series has some great scifi ideas and interesting plot!"
5,Finally! Intelligent television,"Don't let this show pass you by! Great acting, even more complex story lines and the great John Noble once again sporting his retired professor clothing line. And who doesn't like just looking at Joshua Jackson??? Anna Torv is so believable as both Olivia and Faux-livia. Catch up on Season Three and keep the next season episodes coming!"
3,okay ending,"it's a good thing this season ending is good, otherwise I doubt I'd even try to watch next season. As it is, though, it was less boring than the other shows this season, and now I want to find out what's going to happen. But if season 4 is as boring as this one, I won't bother sloughing through it. So here's hoping...."
5,Third season of an extraordinary show.,"Fringe show never fails at creating original content and desire more episodes. One of the best tv shows ever, and the current scifi/thriller/mystery best."
3,A different Fringe,Being of the age of the X-files when I found Fringe I was totally hooked. Living in the remote Alaskan wilderness and not having a TV and only a DVD player I had to wait a long time for the Third season. The shows quality is equal to season one and two but I disliked them carrying the one theme for the entire season. Having (almost) the entire season deal with Olivia and her 'other universe' Olivia got a bit tiring. However it is part of the puzzle of Fringe and had to be explained and I am happy that I now have it.
5,Oh my gosh!,Last season my husband was missing so I used my Amazon prime account for him to watch on amazon instant app.....he hasn't taken his nose out of his iPad....enough said lol
2,dvds,"i am sorry about this but dvds were all scratched up.and box was all broken, which probably happened in the mail.but as you said good to very good? sorry"
1,Not a fan anymore,"Fringe started out a bit slow in season 1 but found its voice quickly. The rest of season 1 was good, and season 2 was great. Season 3 is a major let down. I'll watch the first few episodes of season 4, but if it gets no better, I won't keep trying. I watched the entire 3rd season and was really disappointed."
1,bummer,"I was really looking forward to season 3, but it's disappointing, to say the least. I wish they hadn't dragged on the story line about the other universe for so long. Seems to me the writers are stagnant. Major Bummer."
1,not good,"One thing I don't get is, since Peter is so observant, why doesn't he see that this Olivia still has darker eyes? That's just one problem I have with season 3. It's really just a drudgery to watch, compared to seasons 1 and 2. I hope season 4 and 5 are better."
1,Boring,"Well I'm sure it's obvious by now that I don't like season 3, but THIS episode is the most boring of all. There's nothing new here that we didn't already know or could guess. I suppose they can't all be golden, but this one is definitely a throw away and it wouldn't be missed whatsoever. How many ways can I say boring?? Bummer, characterless, cloying, colorless, commonplace, dead, drab, drag, drudging, dull, flat, ho-hum, humdrum, insipid, interminable, irksome, lifeless, monotonous, moth-eaten, mundane, nothing, nowhere, platitudinous, plebeian, prosaic, repetitious, routine, spiritless, stale, stereotyped, stodgy, stuffy, stupid, tedious, threadbare, tiresome, tiring, trite, unexciting, uninteresting, unvaried, vapid, wearisome.All those words ALMOST describe this ridiculous episode."
2,Features menu locks up Blu Ray player,"First, all of the episodes play fine. They look great in Blu Ray. 5 Stars for the show, however, the disk menu functionality leaves much to be desired. This is the first Blu Ray disk playback issue I've had w/ player Sony BDP-BX38 - whose firmware is up to date. ""BD Live"" and most of the ""Features"" lock up the player, which then has to be restarted. So, I guess this review's as much of a slam on Sony as it as on Warner Home Video. Apparently, BR development isn't all that commonized yet. My options are- wait it out and hope that Sony's next update fixes the issue or to exchange the blu ray for DVD. Undecided."
3,i wanted to really like this season,"i had high hopes for season 3. season1 and 2 were fantastic i couldn't wait for season 3 to come out.silly mesex....sex ruined Moonlighting and that first kiss ruined x-files. WHY did the two leads have to fall for each other....and a doppleganger have his kid.it is ruined.the very fact that they are in love now is orevekent in every show and seems to be the by line. we couldn't jest get on and tell a story that's been building since dr bishop stole peter...the war between the two universes.i hear you...the story is even more there since fux-livia has peter's baby and peter will have to choose which universe to save, blah. the show has gone down hill"
5,Best Show for pure entertainment on television,"I started watching ""Fringe,"" well into the first season and was stunned as to how good the show was. I made it a point to always be at home when I knew that it was going to be on. As soon as I had a DVR installed, it was the first show that I set up to record at all times! It's so different and keeps you sitting in complete silence & on the edge the whole time that it's on. I just wish that Fox had enough sense to promote this show as it's quality that we don't often see on that network. It's so good that it honestly makes you wonder...........""what if?""....Please FOX network, keep renewing this show.....it's the best you've ever done!! AND YES, I've bought both seasons on DVD."
5,Gift,I bought this as a Christmas present for my mother. I am also a fan of the show. It's very unique and inventive.
5,Captivating,"We started watching Fringe casually, and we are now hooked, every episode just sucks you in. It is facinating on so many levels, just when you think you've lost the thread, you get it again and have an urgent need for more!"
5,Radical,Amazing show. It is one of theses shows that you can't stop watching. I love the special features included in the set.
4,Decent continuation of Series,"Love the series, while not its strongest year, it advanced the story well, and as always the acting especially Anna Torv's was excellent."
5,Great Show,A friend suggested this and I am really glad I took him up on it. Love the tech and science fiction
3,Fimge season three,"Wasn't too pleased with season one , seemed lyke a reamake of X-files then season 2 had elements of Torchwood.Am watching season 3 now liked the episode with cartooon charactors, give it a tumbs up."
5,Great show,I am really hooked on this series. Every episode is unique and interesting. It keeps drawing me back for more
5,Thrilling,"Love it very much, we look forward to seeing everynight. Can't wait for to see the next season. would recommend to others."
4,Get it Cheaper at Target !,"If you're reading this, you probably already know what a great show this is. There's no point in giving you another set of opinions about characters, writing and plot points.The only purpose of this review is to let you know that this week (January 8 to 15), this same box set (Fringe Season 3) is on sale at Target for $15 ! Yes !! $15 !!! How about that ?!Why are you still here, looking at the screen ? Go buy it ! Now !!!!"
5,Great series,"Super good series. Exciting, may be slow at random times, but picks up with a whole new twist almost every episode. Hard to stop watching!"
4,Well Done,excellant production and acting and story line. Scenes are well set up and presented. Sound and visual effects are also well done
3,OK show but terrible delivery,"Show was ok but delivery was terrible, forever locking and needing a browser restart. Amazon also needs to look at improving its bookmarking setup to male it easier to return to a series you are watching."
5,Imaginative and fun,Great science based show. Great characters and their interactions are very well written. You do have to follow episode to episode to catch all the references but well worth it.
5,Fringe Three,the twists and turn were unbelieveable. I was intrigued by all the new technology they came up with. Very unexpected.
5,Fringe Division's got it right,"These stories, like the unearthly mysteries, are worth investigating. Watch FRINGE. The fate of our universe depends on it, and Walter might share his licorice with you"
3,interesting,Fringe is interesting enough. It has a couple good strong acting performances. But after a couple it is repetitive and doesn't do much for my attention span.
5,"Great! Lot's of science, love, and destruction!","Fringe is always pretty good...but than sometimes it's great. This is one of those episodes. I suggest to watch the previous episode too because Alternate Olivia is almost better acted than original. It's kinda cool that they started making her good. Anyway this episode has it all; lot's of action, love, science-fiction, God. It's not perfect but no great show is."
1,Fringe- Season 3,"There is a flaw on disc 5 which made it impossible to watch the first episode on that disc to completion. This is the second time I have encountered.this problem with a DVD purchased from Amazon, and it is the last time I will make that.same mistake again.pauldavidinsf@yahoo.com"
1,amazon vod,"In the time this video took to start playing, I downloaded it on itunes instead, in HD and watched the episode. If your vod service is going to be this slow and useless, please at least price it accordingly. The five green dots of the loading never stopped, even when moving the player to low quality setting. I would ask for a refund, but I bought the episode from a $5 twitter credit (encouraging people to try it for free, I guess). Obviously that post has been deleted. Lesson learned, amazon vod still behind itunes, which for the same price is a no brainer."
1,RIp Off !,"2 dollars an episode Is way too much to charge, episodes used to be one dollar and even that was excessive. It shouldn't cost more than 10 cence to watch an episode. I will not be using amazon for streaming video again untill they Lower their prices."
2,Story goes flat after the first few episodes,"I love sci-fi, but sometimes the repeating theme can get to you... this show might have been good if you only watched one episodes every few weeks, but if you watch two or three in a row... ugh... I often found myself walking into the kitchen, forgetting I was watching a new episode for the first time... everyone felt like a bad repeat about four episodes in..."
1,"What matters is who runs the show, not the quality of the show.","This show would have been cut long time ago if it was not from JJ Abrams. Terrible show to begin with, totally off the wall but manage to get some good ratings due to its initial time slot. The show's ratings start going downhill once it was move out of the original time slot. But yet it gets renewed year after year while much better shows with better ratings get cut by Fox one after another."
4,We are Fringe fans.,"First off, BRD and quality are great, no issue with physical product. Season Three just seemed a bit... less appealing than the first two seasons. Season Four we are watching with Prime streaming right now and I can say that we are enjoying Season 4 a bit more. Maybe the plots are just seeming to repeat at this point?"
3,Interesting only when used as a textbook,"I had to purchase this title for an acting class in college, and there the information and points were usefull, but not in the real world."
3,Very Small,"I got this to inflate my camping air mattress and so far it works quite well. The first thing that you'll notice about the unit is how small it is. It measures only 6in x 6in x 3in. The unit does an OK job of filling up the mattress although it doesn't have enough power to get the mattress super full. But sufficient none the less. The cords for recharging the unit are contained within a compartment on the unit but unfortunately, the attachments are not. The unit charges both on AC and the included car adapter which is the main reason I bought this item. The manual also indicates that it will work while charging on 12V."
3,Love Never Dies,"The movie Madhumati was made for lovers everywhere. It portrayed the saying ""love never dies"" perfectly and the actors, Dilip Kumar and Vijantymala were the perfect couple in this love story. There was just the right amount of romance and tragedy shown in this movie with a very interesting twist towards the end. The songs were amazing and they fit the movie perfectly. My favourite one was ""toote hoi khabo ne."" To top it off, Johnny Walker gave a wonderful performance that added much needed comedy to this film. I cannot think of any scene that i disliked, the directors did a wonderful job making sure that the movie was always interesting."
3,Cotton Candy Fiction,"""Fatal Cure"" is a quick read. There's no depth of character to slow the reader; but the plot weaves as pages turn. Dr. Angela Wilson is a pathologist who does not like her boss touching her on the derriere or pulling her onto his lap for a peek at the microscope, a scientific lap dance. When she complains about sexual harassment, her boss suddenly gets upset with her. Then when a dead body of the former hospital administrator is found in her basement requiring continual absences from work, she gets fired! Where is CSI Vermont!?! ... This book was fun because something was always happening. It was also frustrating because the characters lacked perception. This is a fast read that's fiction's nutritional equivalent to cotton candy. A definite maybe!"
1,Cook Must Be Kidding,"This is an unbelievably bad book. The story, including the identity of the villain, is obvious within the first chapters. The characters, dialogue and situations are so unbelivable as to be ridiculous. If the protagonists in this story graduated from medical school, I might consider sending my hamster, because they seem to have about an equal intelligence level. David and Angela should have figured this whole mess out even before I did, but they were too busy listening to their daughter's improbable dialogue, answering her with trite, cutesy nonsense, and putting her into situations that should have made them lose their parenting privileges. Cook should leave polemics about HMOs to the analysts and concentrate on basic writing techniques - plot, character development and dialogue."
1,Fatal just about describes it!!,"Complete waste of time! I am done reading Robin Cook books for now..The story line for this book is so stupid I am amazed Mr. Cooks editors even allowed it to be printed..I'm not sure about the hospitals where Robin lives or works at, but in the area where I live, if just one patient died there would be an immediate investigation, but here we have several patients die from unknown causes and the characters just move along like it's no big deal..The Wilsons even allow their daughter to be admitted!!! Give me a break!! Like I said..don't waste your time on this one!!"
1,A thinly disguised rant about managed competition.,"A thinly disguised rant about managed competition, seen of course from the Doctor's point of view. The two protagonists are unbelievably stupid, but then they would have to be for such a week plot to survive the full length of the book. This is the first Robin Cook book I have read and is likely to be my last."
5,One of Cooks Best,This book was excellently written and I extremely liked it.There was just one part that cold have been better.
1,Badly written and predictable,"Robin Cook has a political message, but is not content to let the message come across with anything less than the force of a sledgehammer. He has rammed the same message about managed care down the readers throat one time too often. I found this book was extremely annoying to read, despite the fact that I agree with the message! Dr. Cook does not seem to even try to develop his characters, and the writing is what one would expect from an eighth grader, not a mature author. Don't waste your time reading this one!"
4,The Cure,"This book deals with the exciting lives of two doctors and their ill daughter, who move to a new community only to find a dead body in their new house and a town full of secrets. This was a extremely interesting book, with intricate details and an exciting plot. The only drawback to the book was the length. Although the book remained exciting throughout the book, the end could have been tightened to remove unneccesary and sometimes boring information. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the medical field, or anyone who enjoys a good murder mystery!"
3,Recurring theme,"I just finished Robin Cook's Fatal Cure first published in 1993. Health care reform was a huge topic then, and surprise it is, or will be a big topic in the upcoming presdential election in 2008. The plot and characters are not developed well but the read is easy and engaging. As a physician myself, I can relate to the excitement and uncertainty of finally finishing your training to start your career, but with the economic burden of debt. Now as a practicing physician, I am acutely aware of how the economics of medicine do not necessarily mix with good patient care. Dr. Cook's thoughts on the subject are well presented in the last few pages of the novel. An old novel with a timely message."
3,Not the real world,"I enjoyed reading the book because it did have a good idea behind it. What bothered me, though, was how unrealistic the main characters' responses were to what happened to them. What got me the most was when the two characters that the family and the little girl were supposedly so close to died, they didn't even contact their families or attend their funerals! PLEASE! At least mention it in the book for 5 seconds so that we know that you have at least a slight grasp of what would really happen! No wonder everyone in Barlet hated them!!"
1,Absolutely Awful,"I'm sure you've read the plot synopsis by now, so I'll skip it and get to the real review. This book is a long, contrived, boring piece of unrealistic drivel. This guy went to Harvard? It reads like an Encyclopedia Brown mystery, except you figure it all out much quicker. The characters are underdeveloped and frighteningly unrealistic (not to mention just plain stupid. It took them 400 pages to figure out what was going on? Maybe they went to Harvard, too). Evidently, in Dr. Cook's world nobody ever utters an obscenity or does anything risque or more involved than ""making love."" We get pages and pages about a man having an affair with his business associate, been when it comes to the pivotal moment the experience is summed up in two words. Sounds like Cook is as prudish as his main characters. Skip this book unless you enjoy mind-bogglingly bad literature (a la ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"", perhaps). This is my first, and last, Robin Cook novel."
3,When We Were Kings,"We African Americans often say, ""We came from kings and queens."" Here's a book that attempts to attest to that. Because these kings lived centuries ago, a summary of their lives and reigns is not dated. However, this book clearly comes from the time when interest in Africa was big among African Americans in the 1960s. This book has pictures in two colors; it's not as dull as black-and-white, but not as vibrant as colorful books. This is not for little children; it is more for youngsters from ages 9 to 12. This is a great book for book reports or class speeches during Black History Month. I appreciate the diversity of the kings, but I thought African queens, or women passing as kings, and rulers from Southern Africa (like Shaka Zulu) could have been covered."
3,Nice-- but some items I thought were standard weren't apparently!,"I thought that a light on a watch was standard- and was surprised to see that it isn't. This makes it very difficult to see the time for me, especially since I am fairly sight impaired. I would have bought a different one, had I realised there was no light. This is not the seller's fault, but it was a disappointment to me."
4,"amazing voice, excellent songs","Wonderful combination of Jean Redpath's singing with Abby Newton's cello accompaniment. The songs are a mixture of traditional Scots songs, along with new musical settings of poems, and one song set to a classical melody.Anyone looking for a song that expresses the sadness of being far from home and unable to return should hear Violet Jacob's poem ""The Wild Geese"" on this album.Jean Redpath communicates the emotions of the songs in a way that few other singers can do. One or two of the songs are a bit too sentimental and 'People's Friend'-style for my taste (trust me, anyone Scottish will know what this means !) but the album as a whole is one I have been coming back to again and again for years."
2,nothing new or enlightening...,"I didn't get much out of this..I am a widow of 18 months, and was hoping for direction or points to follow to better equipt myself for this journey through grief.. I wouldn't recommend it if you are looking for guidance or help along the way.."
4,Hard to find item,I purchased maximum strength Ascriptin online through Amazon. Typically I might pay less than $10 for this product either at the store or at another online site. However I haven't been able to find this product at all so I went through Amazon. They had the product but I paid $40! Highway robbery! Since this is the only product I can take that relieves my migraines I paid the fee but felt totally ripped off. Next time I will try another avenue.
2,New Mermaids Edition has Inadequate Notes,"In using this edition to teach a college course, I found that the editorial notes were vastly inadequate, and I ended up having to make a supplementary glossary for students. For that reason, I don't recommend the New Mermaids edition."
5,Still the best Olney album,"David Olney's second solo album, released in 1988, is 20 years and many albums later still his best. This album is simply brilliant, showing how great David Olney as a singer/songwriter is. His songs are like short movies, painting a lively picture.One of the highlights of this album is 'Jeruzalen Tomorrow' which is a good demonstration of Olney's unique style. The song has been recorded by various artists and can be found on nearly all of David Olney's live albums. The only thing better than listening to this album is attending a David Olney concert."
5,Soooo Freakin Good,"So, you watch movies to be entertained and that's what you get with this movie. You never want to stop watching AND then you want to watch it again. There is a lot of gore but, it's kind of abstracted by the comic book setting but overall it's a pretty rough movie. Still, it was good enough we are planning to watch it again."
4,HEADS UP....Special Edition due in December,"I'm not sure if it has been noted here before but another edition of ""Sin City"" is set to be released in December. This new edition (from what I've read, mostly from a Frank Miller interview) has more special features and breaks the stories into stand alone vignettes. So, instead of the three stories interlocking and jumping from story to story, each will be told sperately in it's entirety. Just an FYI so everyone is aware."
4,very unexpected,"I have never read any of the comics this movie is based on, in fact I don't read comics period. But I loved this movie anyway. It was gritty and in-your-face and completely shocking. Even though most of the movie is black and white, there was just so much going on. It kept you on your feet from intro to credits. So take an awesome storyline, add a power cast of heavy hitter actors and you've got an equation for one kickass movie!!! Buy it, this is a must-have to anyone's collection."
5,It RAWKS!!!!,"Yea this movie was great, 2 friggin awesome love stories and a great revenge story could ya ask for more? Oh did I mention it's violent, gritty, and down right nasty? If you liked the comics, you'll love the movie, if you like action, you'll like the movie, if you just like seeing people get what they deserve and the not-so-good-guy-but-not-so-bad-guy kick some serious butt, you will like this movie..."
5,Amazing,"This is a strange case: the movie is not based in the comic... IT IS THE COMIC. Here, in Mexico, Grupo Editorial Vid published the series almost 5 years ago and every comic-reader was shocked. Even now, I have a friend who hates comic-books and still, she falled in love with this one. That says a lot about the movie so for me, it's the best ""comic-movie"". I know it's full of violence but in the end, the movie is about love and frienship. How bad could it be that? Please, check it out and try to watch it with your mind open. Maybe you'll fin a big surprise."
5,A Masterpiece.....visually brilliant.....,"SIN CITY is by far one of the most breathe-taking visual movies i have ever seen....the cast an great ensemble jessica alba, bruce willis, rosario dawson, clive owens, benicio del toro, elijah wood, etc etc.its 4 stories packed into one edge of your seat thriller....you can tell that quentin tarentino had something to do with this movie because of the blood and gore from the movie (i.e. kill bill series).. but it is done like the comic is supposed to be....either way the movie is a triumph and visually will catch you by suprised... i will definatley recommend this movie to any movie watcher....5 stars out of 5"
5,Dark and grity classic,"This movie took me by surprise. I new who Frank Miller was but had never really seen any of his work. However after watching this movie I feel that I have been missing out. There is a great story that unfolds through out the entire movie. Everyone of the different characters are rich and interesting. Needless to say this is not a kid friendly movie, but for those who are a little older and aren't to squeamish, then this is a movie that you may want to check out."
4,Fantastic!,"This was a great movie! I suggest getting it, it is one of those movies you will want to watch over and over."
4,"5-Star Movie, Disappointing DVD","Sin City was an amazing film, first off.It's a wild, dark, over-the-top brain-buster of a thrill ride, an exciting, visually innovative film that left me gasping and raises comic-book films to a new level of artwork.So why the lousy release?Rodriguez is renowned for DVD extras- The ten-minute schools and other good stuff. But this DVD contains nothing other than a seven-minute featurette. No commentary or anything.Buy this DVD, as the film is worth seeing many, many times. But, if you're strapped for cash, wait for the special edition. This disc contains an incredible film, but that's about it."
5,One of the best DVD transfers I've ever seen (and a great movie),"I'll leave the movie reviews to the other posters... what I want to comment on is the picture and audio quality of this perfect DVD transfer.One of the advantages of digital cinema (i.e. using HDTV video instead of film) is that when you transfer it to DVD, it looks phenomenal... and this is no exception. However, with the Sin City transfer, they specifically optimized it for wide screen TVs... so instead of ""zooming in"" on a letter boxed video, the content is on the disc as full-resolution 16:9 video... and it looks amazing-- nearly indistinguishable from 720p content from a distance. Finally, a DVD that really shines on high-quality HDTV sets.The sound is equally impressive.This is literally the best DVD transfer I've ever seen-- it so perfectly matches what was shown in the theatres that it really does this excellent film justice... which is great, because the film truly is visually stunning."
5,A feast for the eyes,"This is a top notch blu ray release and will be the one I pop into my PS3 when I want to show off my system. The remastering is of the highest quality as is the sound.There are a plethora of bonus features included. Some of the best ones are exclusive to the blu-ray version including an interactive comic book which is very creative in its execution.I loved Sin City when I first saw it in the theater, but the extended cut is superior and the way the directors intended. Separating the stories into different films adds to the continuity of each tale and the added footage fleshes out the storylines. Once you see this version, you'll never want to see the theaterical cut again.[...]"
5,Great Comic Book Movie,"This movie is one of my all time favorites. It does an excellent job capturing the essence of the Graphic Novels of Frank Miller, probably because of the close working relationship between Miller and the Director. When you watch the film it feels like you are reading a comic book where the story relies more on the visual than the dialog to advance the story, and the visuals are truly one of a kind. The film is shot so it matches the story board of the comic book frame by frame down to the smallest detail. While this movie is not for everyone people who like Pulp Fiction and comic books should enjoy it."
5,Great movie,"Great movie, the special features are very interesting. Better thyan the previous DVD version because the story is divided into chapters, you can easily choose the story you want to see."
1,It Looks Like The Comic!...wowee zowee.....,"The main purpose of the filmmakers was to make it look, panel for panel, EXACTLY like the comic. Mission accomplished.As for plot and characters that we care about what happens to, this movie is a complete failure. The film is a mish-mash of several of the comic's stories. It all ends up as a complete mess.The make-up for the more bizzare characters looks ridiculous next to the more human-looking in the cast. And as for Miller's tenth-rate, ""hard-boiled"" dialogue...some things are better read in a comic book than actually spoken. It comes off real cheesy.Stick with producing over-priced comic books, Frank."
2,Smells too much like wine,"And no, I'm not talking about good wine, but rather cheap crap. Face it my ""peeps"" you've all be duped. This so-called movie barely passes as a collection of moody pseudo-arty black-and-white poppycock. My ex-boyfriend - yes, we split amicably and are still friends - told me that this movie was nothing more than a contractual obligation for Robert Rodriguez and partially funded by yes, your least favorite liberal and mine: Michael Moore. The agenda is clear as many shots are taken at the Catholic Church. Don't get me wrong, I'm far from Catholic but I still respect those people more than most religions. Bruce has done far better work in movies like the ""Die Hard"" series, and let's face it this is basically the same performance he gave in ""The Sixth Sense"". I for one preferred it the first time around. Shame on Quentin Tarantino, who I hate besides, for making a bad movie worse. This is the cinematic equivalent of toilet paper - wipe yourself."
1,Fot the video game generation,"I wanted to like this film, i really did. But it just reaked of some lame video game storyline all linked together. It is true to the source material but when adapting a comic to another formal you need to adjust it to that format. This has not been done here. In essence you get a moving graphic novel. If this was to be adapted to a novelisation would the source material be used so literally. I think not. This film was all style over substance. Bad story, lame characters, lame action. It gets one star for Rutger Heurs great performace."
1,I GIVE UP!!!,"No more buying DVD's for me... this double dipping crap is just unbelieveable... it's bad enough that come next year or so when I can actually afford to get a nice spanking new HDTV, I'm going to have to either buy an HDMI compat. DVD player, or re-buy most of the films in my current dvd collection on BLU-Ray, or whatever the newest new format comes out... this is pathetic, from here on out, my dvd budget is going to the nearest rental chain..."
1,Low Entertainment,"I pity all the poor idiots who enjoyed this movie, because their IQs aren't even high enough to understand how stupid they are. This is, without a doubt, the lowest form of entertainment I have ever been subjected to. I only regret that I didn't walk out of the theater sooner. The sex, drugs, and violence are uncontrolled and take over the entire movie. The plot is minimal at best. The visuals are revolutionary, but who cares when that's the only good quality? Sin City is common, unremarkable, and fit for white trash."
1,Possibly the worst movie I ever watched,"This movie is not worth the time wasted watching it. I repeat, TERRIBLE MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Very violent.,"This movie was the worst piece of garbage I've ever seen. I loved Resoviour Dogs, Dusk til Dawn, True Romance so I'm not adverse to violence but this was awful. Even though it was not a true color film, it was just sickening. Not for teenagers!!"
2,"C'mon, it's not *that* great!","In my opinion this was a good movie, but in now way deserved all the hype. The plot felt a little stupid and forced.Want to see this movie? Save money by renting it from Blockbuster, because you'll only need to see it once."
3,Another flick for the adult little boys...,"Nudity in the first 10 minutes. Plenty of killing, blood, torture, and miscellaneous violence. All the female actors are hot, buff and under 30 (and many naked). The male actors range from Rutger Hauer, Powers Boothe, Mickey Rourke, & Bruce Willis to youngster in the Charlie Brown sweater, Elijah Wood.Definitely one of those movies for the boys that they'll all run out and add to their little DVD collections right alongside Star Wars, LOTR Trilogy, Constantine, Matrix, The Professional, Ronin, etc.The ""Marv"" character and storyline was the only reason I gave the movie 3 stars."
2,Visually striking but....,The visuals are great but the endless worship of violence is sick and pointless.
2,"Great Visual Style, Nothing More-Junk Food For the Eye...","Wow. Robert Rodregeiz, Quentin Tarantino together again. The big failure of this film is its screenplay. It reads like a porno novel, using dialog no one would ever use. The second failure of this movie is there are NO characters in this film that is likable. The animation/live action blend is great and the action is pretty non stop. Also, the film is very violent. It would make Freddy or Jason flinch!"
1,"Horrible writing, horrible acting","I just saw this movie. It's intended to be over-the-top, but it goes so far over that it becomes a self-parody. The writing is cheesy and cliched, and the actors can't help but overact to match.It's also interesting that the only jobs available to women in this movie's world are scantily clad waitresses, strippers, naked lesbian parole officers, and whores. I'm all for T&A;, but this was ludicrous.If you want to see excellent film noir that's sexy, violent, and amoral, check out Romeo Is Bleeding. Only see Sin City if you want to laugh yourself sick."
1,"Great movie, but shun this release","Now, I actually love Sin City and I think it should herald a new era of quality adaptations of works. However, this dvd release is simply the pits and deserves to be ignored by any self respecting fan. Double dipping is a low practice, but it's not beyond this disc's distributors. I'm waiting for the special edition, which should have been the first, last, and only edition."
3,Sinful Waste of Money,"All very pretty; pretty boring. I watched it through only because I bought what I thought would be a pretty fantastic flick, but it's all on the surface and a little too dopey for my tastes, even if it did have its roots in a graphic strip or whatever -- that's not enough to excuse the poverty of depth.Oh well."
5,Sin City,"Do you like Bruce Willis and Clive Owen? Do you like Jessica Alba and Rosario Dawson? Do you like treachery, guns, sex, and blood? If so, pick up a copy of Sin City. There isn't anything about the movie I would change, except Michael Clarke Duncan's cameo is kind of forced. I'm excited for the sequel. Excellent supporting performances by Elijah Wood, Mickey Rourke, Carla Gugino, and especially Benicio Del Toro."
4,"Of the ""Pulp Fiction"" genre only better!","I had viewed part of this on TV and was impressed with it and wanted my own copy . . The movie is extremely well done on every level . . hard hitting and fast moving like a visual action comic book . . the characters and acting, make-up and direction is supurb . . I highly recomend it to anyone that likes quality action movies . .Virgil"
4,Stylish and highly stylized,"As a major fan of Robert Rodriguez and a fan of Frank Miller, I think that I was expecting a bit more from Sin City. It's hard to know exactly WHAT I wanted more of, since the film is suffused with style and violence, cheap broads with hearts of gold and mugs who never got a fair shot.But for all the style the film oozes, its extremely stylized dialogue is sometimes hard for the film's cast to get out and sound plausible doing so -- this is particularly true of some of the lines placed in the mouths of the actresses.Still, the film is ruthlessly true to Miller's vision and is easily the most hard-boiled noir movie ever made. As a result, Sin City has to be strongly recommended to fans of either."
2,"Great Movie, Crappy DVD","This was one movie I couldn't wait to have, so I pre-ordered. Movie is perfectly acted, violent, and graphically beautiful.This DVD, however, comes with almost NO extras. Spend the extra US$5 and get the ""Uncut, super-duper, extended"" version."
4,Sin City to Go,"The one drawback to this UMD, in my opinion, is that the one special feature on it is a ""making of . . ."" featurette. I'm not a fan of ""making of . . ."" flicks. I think the limited capability of the UMD would have been better used by including a fan-film or side-story featurette."
5,One of the only comic book movies done right,"I have 5 stars here for the movie, which I enjoyed greatly. The DVD leaves a lot to be desired as there are no special features aside from a small featurette. I have heard rumors about a super edition later in the year with all extras you could ask for, and I'll wait to get it then.The movie, however is probably unlike anything you have ever seen. It is one of the few comic book movies that doesn't alter things in apology for being a comic book movie. It is completely unrealistic, it doesn't really try to look real. But it does look very cool. I had a great time watching the movie. It is a very adult movie as the violence is very extreme at times. But, for adults, it is a very good movie."
4,Wait for the next DVD release,"Movie - *****DVD - ***Unfortunately, this movie will be the victim of a studio ""double dip."" This first release is just a bare bones DVD with no special features. In various interviews, Robert Rodriguez has spoken of the upcoming Special Edition (most likely to be released for the holiday season). As you know, the movie Sin City was created from three of Frank Miller's Sin City books, ""The Hard Goodbye"", ""The Big Fat Kill"", and ""That Yellow Bastard"". Rodriguez shot these stories in their entirity and spliced them together for the theatrical version of the film. In the upcoming Special Edition of the DVD, these three stories will be recut separatly and include footage that was cut for release. The DVD will also include the theatrical version, and the next installment in Rodriguez's ""10 Minute Film School"" series. My advice is to save your money and get the real Sin City DVD when it is released this Winter."
3,Different but good,"This is a movie where you have to really watch the whole thing to truly appreciate it. When I first started to watch it I was not really into it. I found it confusing and hard to follow. Basically it tells three different stories and each one starts in the middle with no real back story. So your left to figure out what's going on. This really hampered the enjoyment of the movie for me at first.Once it was over though and I set back and digested what I had just watched, I found that I really liked it. It is completely original and engaging."
2,I was very surprised and dissapointed,"I really thought this movie was going to be the best for the year. It had such a big name cast and the special effects looked so cool; it was all exciting. what a surprise i was in for. firstly, the special effects are great. that's why i gave it 2 stars instead of 1. your eyes will be dazzled. but it is boring, slow, and long. there is WAY too much talking. i've never ever seen a movie with so much talking in my life. and i don't mean talking as in ""give me action and stop the talking scenes."" i mean even when there's action they slide talking into the action scenes. it got so irritating; it was like shut up already, do these characters have to talk every single thing? additionally even though it is an action movie there isn't really that much action, i think that's what made it fail. jessica alba looks great in it though!"
2,1/2 Good,"So maybe I'd give it 2-1/2 stars if it was possible.The good: The visual. Very stark. Very arresting.The bad: You HAVE to convince yourself to leave believability at the door. From beginning to end.Yeah, yeah, I know this is comic book stuff. But to sit through two hours of getting beaten over the head with over the top violence gets pretty damned dull for the viewer. In my case it took me only 30 minutes to pull the plug on my DVD. Why? Because Rourke's superhuman character gets pulverized by a speeding car THREE times and walks away virtually unscathed, save for a bloodied face. But then, a few scenes later, get's knocked UNCONSCIOUS by a sledgehammer to the noggin.Huh? Direct impact by a speeding automobile inflicts almost zero bodily harm, but a hand held piece of hardware k.o.'s him?!?Safe to say I won't finish this movie anytime soon. If ever. Zzzzzzz."
1,Too much violence!!!,"I remember when a friend of mine told me about a movie (I'm not going to say the name) in which one of the characters is a hitman and killed people with a smile in his face and adding a sarcastic and cynic remark and he didn't stand it because of that , he said, human life is a precious gift. I watched Sin City last night and I think that it is one of the more violent trash-movies I've ever seen. Violence is always a bad thing but in this case is senseless and really stupid. Americans should realize that this country is one of the more violent in the world. People kills each other sometimes only for the pleasure of killing (think about the sniper in the Washington DC area 3 years ago) One of the reasons for this is what we see in the movies. And this movie is an example of that. Frank Miller is a mental-illed guy and his stories should be avoided at any cost. Don't buy or see this piece of garbage!"
3,"Visually stunning, but...","This movie gets all of its stars for its cinematography and none for the plot or characters. Sin City is guilty of being too close to the comic books (which I have read) - this is a movie people, not comic book. People expect development. HOWEVER, once again, cheers for an extremely visually stimulating experience and some priceless shots."
2,"Ugly, depressing, and quite vulgar.","First of all my friends had to drag me to the theatre with them to see this movie. The violence was completely disgusting at points. The scene where that freak ""Marv"" severs Elijah Woods arms and legs, restricts the blood flow by tying off his arteries to keep him from bleeding to death and prolong his agony, before finally severing his head was a real turn off. Marv is someones idea of what a hero is supposed to be I guess. But he is clearly not mine. Bruce willis has a strong role here but its not enough to save this movie. Overall Sin City was such a downer that it left me wishing I had stayed home and popped ""Return of The Jedi"" into my dvd player instead."
2,Technically flawless but still boring,"Don't get me wrong, the movie looked great but it was still a major bore. It was slow and the comic-book dialogue only made it cheesy. I saw it in the theater with digital projection and I still found myself checking my watch. Unless you're a comic book dork you're probably better off finding something else to watch."
3,Mediocre,Movie looked a lot better in the previews. Was slow at times with not a ton of action and too much lovey dovey crap.
1,Lacking,So this DVD seemed promising as the menu was up and I was geared up to watch this excellent movie...but then once it started something very important seemed to be missing....yes it was the audio throughout the film. There was audio in the menu but not the actual movie...so that was pretty lame
4,Sin City,"Great movie.This has three differentstories to it and each one is veryentertaining,the black and whiteeffect looks great except for theblood.The things I thought werea bit stupid was one of the bad guyswas orange and it took like fourty shotswith a gun to kill someone.Other than thatits a great movie with an awesome cast."
1,fell asleep watchig in the theater...,"thought maybe I missed something - so I picked up the DVD. I didn't miss much. It's an awful film that looks great. Rourke gives a stunning performance. Too bad it was in such a waste of time film. I liked the books by the way...but a load of the dialogue comes off as ridiculous when it's said out loud rather than being filtered by your brain in context of paneled art. Glad that people dig it, maybe this kind of stylized film can be built around a good screenplay. Did I mention the music gave me a headache?"
3,"Decent, although less thrilling with additional viewings","I remember absolute being in awe at how Rodriguez brought Frank Miller's graphic novel to screen. I was particularly pleased with seeing some of my favorite actors in definitively different roles. However, this is better to rent than to buy unless you really loved the movie. It does make me excited to see how Miller's other graphic novel, 300, will translate to screen. I think they did a better job on that trailer than this one."
1,BEWARE,"I loved this movie to death, but once again the studios are trying to screw you. Robert Rodriguez has OFTEN spoke at OFFICIAL press conferences saying that a 3-Disc DVD will be available this year, with 30 minutes to each vignette. This will be the BARE-BONES, STUDIO RELEASE. So, think you can wait a few months?"
1,"I love this movie, but don't buy the CD. At least, not now",The director promised a big 3DVD disc that lengthened the story on each of the episodes. The DVD they are releasing now is actually a barebones one. I say that if you actually want more for your money you should wait until the holidays.
2,For Frank Miller die-hard fans only,"...the rest of us skip this movie. I'll admit the best thing about the movie is the way it looks. Rodriguez did an excellenct job in bring a comic book to life. However, some things need to stick to their original medium. I'm counting these illogical wrecks of mini-stories as those that fit in this catagory. After Micky Rourke's short (the best one, IMHO) I was ready for this movie to end. Clive Owens seemed miscasted, but Benico sort of saved the day on that story, but it was still riding on the so-so part. After that, I'm thinking surely that's the end...BUT NO. It keeps going and going, until I'm practically begging the DVD player, please no more. Then there's just one more bit, that I was so close to pulling my hair out, that I was relieved that it only lasted less than a minute. Oh, Thank God. If over the top violence is what gets you off, then this is the movie for you. If not, please, please avoid this movie."
2,What do you know... Art CAN be garbage,"I borrowed this from a friend and am shocked at how much I despise this movie. If you are impressed by a black and white movie containing red dresses -or- beds, than by all means. But if you are person who sees movies for PLOTS and character development, RUN AWAY.It disturbs me that the person I borrowed it from also lent me the TRUE work of art ""Sky Captain"" and implied this had similar magic is a sort of unconventional manner.... well it doesn't. Sin City didn't fool me."
4,"GREAT VISUALS, WEAK PLOTTING, GOOD PERFORMANCES!","The film adaptation of Frank Miller's ""Sin City"" graphic novel is one of the strangest film experiences ever. The visual style is unique, probably one of the first films whose images are similar to those in the books.However, the plotting is weak. The four stories that encompass the movie are too short, and when one ends, we immeadiately jump into another one. For a normal film-goer, this could make it a confusing movie.Another draw-back is that the film is just too graphic. Some of the violent images are needless, and seriously detract from the film.The acting is good, though. Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Mickey Rourke, Rosario Dawson, Jamie King and Jessica Alba give some of their best performances to date.Overall, this is a strange-but-good film that will mostly appeal to fans of the comic book.Movie/DVD Grade: B"
4,Sin City DVD,"I thought the movie was terrific on the big screen. Visually, unlike anything I've seen at the movies. On DVD on a TV screen, it loses a bit, but it's still a stunning picture to watch. Very impressive."
5,Years Best,"Spectacular, Fun and edgy everything you want from a movie in this genre. In fact it takes it to a new level."
4,Lost A Bit In Transition To Home Viewing,"It's kinda sad.In the theater this movie really struck me as having an amazing use of negative space and colors. When something on the screen was in color, be it red lipstick, white crosses, blue eyes, or whatever, the theater was bathed in that color and it really resonated from the screen. The use of black and white stood out with incredible contrast.At home it just looks like a black-and-white movie with random things in color. Most of the erie effect is lost.That said, I loved it in the theater and still like it okay at home, with some question of whether I should be reviewing my experience of the DVD itself or the movie."
1,Double-dip coming soon,Buyer beware--the director has already stated there is a expanded 'special edition' coming out in the future. Do not buy this bare bones DVD if you are a fan of the movie and hate being ripped off by the movie studios!
2,Damaged,The DVD arrived in shoddy packaging that did not protect it from getting squashed. The nice box is now ruined. Disappointed.
5,"Exciting, intense, and beautiful...","I didn't really know much about this movie going into it. I missed the theatrical release, but had heard good things about it. So, I was patiently waiting to see this movie. WOW! This movie was amazing. This is one of the most exciting, intense, and beautifully shot movies I have ever seen. I was absolutely rivetted. The characters and story are wonderfully brilliant. Not to mention the way they shot it. Genius.I was a bit disappointed that they didn't come out with a better, more special feature-packed, disk to begin with, but I was glad to get to see this movie and highly recommend everyone checking this one out."
4,Feels Just Like a Graphic Novel,"I really enjoyed watching Sin City. It is just like the Graphic Novels came to life. The special effects are wonderful.This movie surely stands out in the crowd. No other movie that I can think of has looked this way.The movie is made for the comic book crowd, and stays true to form.Some of the blood and guts got to me alittle, and I had to shut my eyes. But still a good flick."
4,sin city,great comic book movie... great talents... great for Bruce Willis and it shows more than the theatrical release and great special effects
2,Best movie of 2005....One of the year's worst DVDs.,"Sin city was an amazing movie and I could not wait to own it. It turns out Dimension plans on releasing this bare craptacular of a dvd and release a ""Special Edition"" later on. I cannot wait till later to own this amazing movie, so i pre-ordered this sad excuse of a DVD. I will not buy the SE because I'm not made of money. In a perfect world, the Special Edition would be the one released in two weeks."
5,Stunning,"The original theatrical version and unrated director's cut are presented here over two blu ray discs that are simply stunning to look at. The sound is sensational, the picture is reference quality. Highly recommended if your a fan of Sin City."
3,Gruesome City,"In black and white like an old gangster movie the gravel voiced good guysare too tough to die without a second shot of electricity...With all the blood, guts, torture and killing it is hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys. All the girls are just as tough and ready as the guys : it's hard to find one that isn't some kind of slut or whore.There is no shade of gray in these bad guys or monsters. It always seems like the bad guys are rich , powerful and on the edge of winning or pulling off some unspeakable crime like child torture and killing,but the good guys take the bullets and come back for more.Reminds one of a Dick Tracy serial from the 30's."
5,Sin City,"Awesome, did they ever come out with Sin City 2. I have watched this several times. It is a classic that you don't want to miss."
5,Sin City In Blu-Ray,It had been a few years since I had seen Sin City. This was the first time I've seen it in Blu-Ray. What a Treat!
4,One of the first great comic/graphic novel movies.,"The movie is great, really hits all the parts from the graphic novel like it was taken from book to screen from frame to frame.In the Recut, Extended and Unrated version you get the option to watch each part of the movie itself or view them all together. There wasn't much added in terms of extending the film, a few comical parts with Marv and longer credits, which honestly, who needs that?Special features are really nice, it's cool to see them break down parts of the movie especially the part that was specially directed by Quentin Tarantino in the car.Maybe it's because the film is mostly black and white (minus a few color accents, mainly red), but it looks really good in HD and worthy of an upgrade if you're a fan of the film or bought into the original release which was movie only with no features whatsoever."
1,Dont get fleeced by the greedy fat cats,"I really wanted to get this dvd but was alarmed to see the only 'extra' on the disc is a lousy featurette, I mean these sort of discs were made 5 years ago not now. When I read about a multi-disc version coming in a few months time it just goes to show how greedy the movie studios are and they will continue to do this unlesss gullible, impatient sheep stop buying these plain discs and demand and wait for the proper full version.It wouldnt be so bad if they made a load of extras now and then released the later one with different extras and more scenes so at least you would have 2 different versions. Also does anyone know if the later discs will include extra/deleted/extended scenes? Better yet why couldnt they release just one, full, definitive version like the star wars trilogy? Just be patient guys and resist the temptation!"
5,ONE OF MY FAVORITES OF THE YEAR!,"This movie gets it right on all levels.Though I've never read the comics by frank miller,I think now's good time to catch up.Visually impressive,editing is top-notch,acting I would give 100 on any scale.Just Mickey Rourkes' part alone deserves at least a 'GOLDEN GLOBE' nomination.Make sure you have plenty of popcorn around for this one people!"
1,Garbage,"Perhaps the worst movie of all time. Unwatchable. My wife and I made it through about 20 minutes before we shut it off. It's classic ""Terrantino"" garbage - shock value and that's all."
2,WHAT A WASTE OF TIME!,"This movie is the most disguisting pile of manure I've ever been sujected to.I gave it two stars only because Amazon policy mandates that every product reviewed receive at least 1 star,the second star is for,the all to brief appearence of,the beautiful and exciting Rosario Dawson."
1,This movie is no Pulp Fiction,"This movie was a big disappointment for me. It kind of just dragged on. I didn't get bored with the movie, but I was excited watching it either. It had a touch of Quentin to the movie, but not near as good as Quentin does it. Its almost like a weird bad version of Pulp Fiction. Except Pulp blows this movie out of the water. The only thing I enjoyed about this movie was Elijah Woods. His part was super groovy. But thats it. I would suggest renting this movie before you buy it. All the people I've talked to did not like the movie, but there are a lot of reviews on this site that do like the movie. I guess its just a acquired taste. I'll stick with Quentin as opposed to Robert. Never been a big fan of his except Desperado. And bewarned, this movie has a lot of sexuality in it. If you don't like a lot of senseless nudity, you won't like this flick. That alone will keep me from ever watching this movie again.."
1,"GREAT MOVIE ,BUT NOT DVD!!!","I really liked and loved this movie. And I knew when comes to DVD, I would buy it for sure for my DVD collection ,but this DVD very simple and plain. Not double disk or DTS or nothing an all...if u really love this movie like I did,Wait a while till end the year I am VERY SURE they going to come with DTS or Superbit Or Dir cut,I am going to wait for sure to get the whole McCoy. These days they do that with most movies, Then after few months they come up with all loaded stuffs on DVD."
2,Interesting concept used for mindless violence,"Once you get used to the style, which is great without question, you realize how boring this movie really is. That's except if you love guns, bar fights, hookers, swords, drugs, horror, dead people and every possible combination of these. I guess lot of folks do like to see this sort of stuff, hence the amazing 8.4 average rating on IMDB, amazing to me that is.Anyway, the one thing I liked about the movie is Mickey Rourke's acting, he just outcooled everybody. Benicio Del Toro was pretty good too. Token appearances by Michael Madsen, Rutger Hauer and others. Can't say anything about Jessica Alba, she didn't really have a part in the movie until the end, and by that I just wanted it to be over."
1,not so good,"I found this movie generally annoying. It was shot beautifully, the sets are really cool and comic book-like, and special effects were not bad. However, the story was very cliche and I really didn't care for any of the characters. I felt like it went on for hours and hours and nothing really happened. However, the one big plus for lovers of the female body is that there was no shortage of scantily clad hot-bodied women, and, of course, Jessical Alba in chaps."
1,gory shock value sex nudity naked women murdered or tortured,"Let me be straights, I liked ""pulp fiction"" it had a story to it.But, Sin City was nothing but gratuitous violence, bodies cut up, people tortured for no reason other than psychos wanted to. Beautiful sexy women turned on by blood and gore. Sex, rape, murder, torture, cannibalism all glorified like these are the best ideas a person can have to make their life more meaningful.It should have been rated X, and the commercial should let you know how much nudity, blood, gore, sex, and violence is in the movie, instead of showing it as if it were artsy and clever.There is no story, or very little story. If it weren't for the constant violence the movie would be nothing but black and white boring depressive scenes. You feel no sympathy for any of the main characters through they certainly tried to make you feel sorry for them by beating them half to death."
2,Sin City,Typical Quentin Tarantino film. You either love him or you hate him. This film was very gratuitous sex and violence wise. Not a whole lot of deep plot thinking. I did give it atleast two stars for the unusual filming techniques and special effects.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I was dragged to the theaters by my brother to go see this movie. I wasn't expecting to enjoy it (action is not usually my thing), but this was far worse than I could imagine. It was actually the worst movie I have ever seen. The longest two hours of my life. I have never read the comic books on which this movie is based on, so I was confused out of my mind. The movie went from one story to another, without any real connection between stories. The characters are shot time and time again, and yet live on with barely any signs of suffering. This movie is pretty much just violence and hookers. No real story or plot. Just violence and hookers. Like I said, don't waste your money. This movie was beyond horrible."
2,yikes!!!!!!!!!!!!,"the one reviewer was right, this movie is for geeks and homebound comic book readers, sixty bullet holes and still moving, now that takes quite an imagination, and talk about no daylight anywhere in this flick, you geeks have got to get out of your parents house more often."
4,Torn between two lovers!,"This is one of those rare films where it's best qualities aren't its worst. That only happens in cinema everytime the opposite fails to take place. Having said that, I think every viewer should know something about anything before sitting down to invest time into sitting down (with this movie, naturally).The story starts out with several related elements, and the scenery only enhances itself. Throughout, the erudite viewer will no doubt pick up some elements of the plot that weren't immediately evident before the movie began. But this is a small price to pay for something that's worth more than the paid price!By the way: don't look for any cameos by my friend, Jerry, because he doesn't even live in Sin City.Shrimpboat Lou"
2,I had to turn it off after an hour...,This movie was simply too boring and stuoid to keep watching. It's basically a darker version of Dick Tracey.Skip this one unless you like the comic books.
1,Dreadful waste of time and energy,"Sin City is, perhaps, one of the worst films of the year. I was amazed to discover that others found the so-called ""story lines"" compelling, for I was left utterly disinterested. In fact, I barely made it through the movie with my sanity intact. I am less amazed at those who found it to be visually compelling. But the visual interest is quite buried beneath a wealth of pointless violence and a truly horrendous script. I would give it zero stars if it were allowable!!!"
1,The Worst Movie I've Ever Seen!,"I have to be honest and say I've never seen the comic that this film is based on. So, I probably wouldn't be interested in seeing the comic for this. But I have to say that this is absolutlely, the most stupid, pathetic, movie I've ever seen. If I could rate it with 0 stars, I would. After about 5-10 minutes, I completely lost interest. For the first time in my life of watching movies, I felt like getting up and walking out. However, I didn't as I was with a friend. Partway through the movie, my friend told me she didn't care for the movie either and we both said that we couldn't wait for it to end. Afterwards, my friend and I talked about how horrible the movie was. Other people in the theatre also mentioned their displeasure with the movie. I felt like I completely wasted $6.00, and if it were possible to get it, I would want a refund. Don't bother wasting your time to see this movie!"
1,Possibly The Worst Movie I've Ever Seen,"Despite the all-star cast, Quentin Tarintino's guest directing, and attempt to make the movie ""artistic"" and stylish, it was unbelievably horrible.This is a movie with a plot (if that's what you want to call it) that was based AROUND the violence. Basically, it's just that--a movie about violence. Everyone's a killer and they all enjoy being killers. Not five minutes go by (literally) without chopped off limbs flying, eyeballs popping, blood squirting, heads rolling...you get the picture.I've never been one to shy away from a film that shows violence and gore, but when that's all there is to the movie it gets boring real fast. The only good thing I can say about it is I liked the crime novel style of dialogue. But really that's about it."
1,What a waste of time!!!,"I can't believe that this film is rated so highly. There were three types of males in this movie: Bad guy, bad cop, and good cop with a bad attitude. There were four types of females in this movie: Hooker, dike, stripper, and whore.What kind of a freak could like a movie like this? Once again, Tarrantino is overrated because of his shock techniques, and not because of any viable talent. When I realized that there was no plot to this film, I looked for art. No art was visible. Basically, this film is a freakshow that freaks will enjoy...GAG!!!!"
2,Disturbing,"I got the dvd as a gift and with all of these teen movie actors in the film (Josh Hartnett, Elijah Wood, Brittany Murphy, Alexis Bledel, etc.), I was expecting something completely different. I was expecting something light-hearted and silly, but Sin City is one of the most disturbing movies I have ever seen. There are some amazing visuals, but they're so shocking and brutal. Lots of nudity, blood, gore, violence. It was too much for me.I guess the storylines are interesting and there's lots of interlacing and they tie together near the end. Some of the storylines are somewhat trite and not that intriguingIf you're really into visual violence and fantasy, this is a good movie. But definitely don't watch it if you're under 17 or if you can't stand the sight of blood."
4,I love SIN City,I saw the movie at theaters and I love it just as much on Blu-ray. I love the extended footage as well. A great purchase for me.
3,"Compared to The Spirit, this is a masterpiece","Co-directed by Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller (who clearly has a lot more to learn if you've seen his solo debut The Spirit), Sin City looks more and more impressive as flicks like Spirit and Watchmen strive to create the same excitement. It's $16 more than the standard DVD but it does contain both a restored theatrical edition as well as a lengthier Uncut Edition that was clearly put together with a lot of care. Loads of extras include Rodriguez hosting a ""15 Minute Film School"" among much else. A digital copy would have put this over the top. Pricey but worth it for hardcore fans. The Spirit ($39.99 on BluRay; Lionsgate) comes with a BluRay and standard DVD and digital copy and you won't enjoy watching any of them. Overheated and embarrassing adaptation of the classic hero. Visit me at michaelgiltz dot com."
2,"Over the top, too taratino-ish for me.","Movie is a little annoying, and is overkill as far the violence is concerned, pretty graphic, Rosario dawson is super hot, other than that, there is no incentive to watch, I felt like I was being dragged to through another Quentin Taratino-ish flick."
3,It was a weird movie,"It was better than I thought it was going to be. But it was really weird. It had alot of action, so if you like action movie, you will like this one."
5,"action, beauty, best cast and crew","this movie is totaly grate, special fx, script, adaptation, the edition of the storys keep the atention of all public.if you like action movies, this is one of the best.Robert Rodriguez and Tarantino, this names says all."
4,It's a entertaining film but not everyone can embrace Sincity.,"Sin city wasn't really the type of film that everyone would appreciate, one must remember this film comes right out a comic book, i love Bruce Willis is like one of my favorite actors and he had the perfect voice to do the story telling, his character role was let's say typical Bruce, it can be considered a simple story with a light twist, the plot was reasonable and all in all enjoyable at least for me, i say it's worth a watch laterz folks."
2,I wouldn't buy it if I were you...,"Don't get me wrong, I really like this movie. While there isn't a great plot, it's so stylish and beautifuly done it's hard not to enjoy. But, in what is quickly becoming a tradition in Hollywood, the studio plans on releasing this and then a two-disc special edition several months later. Talk about greed! If I were you, I'd wait. If you really love the movie, why not rent it or watch it On Demand in the meantime?"
3,A city drenched in violence,"You have to give Robert Rodriguez credit for remaining faithful to Frank Miller's vision, but the graphic novels do not translate very well to the screen. It reminded me alot of Richard Romanus' Heavy Metal, as Rodriguez tried to piece together several of Frank Miller's stories into one movie. Still, I liked the look and feel of the movie, a deeply saturated black and white with spot colors. It was interesting to see such actors as Mickey Rourke and Elijah Wood transformed beyond all recognition. Clive Owen proved to be an inspired choice as Dwight, making a good contrast to Benecio del Toro's talking head. But, in the end, this movie simply didn't add up. It was more like a promotion for Frank Miller's serial graphic novels, which he continues to put out having gone beyond comic heros such as Batman and the Daredevil. This isn't kids' stuff, but a series drenched in lurid sex and violence, which seems to be the staple of pulp fiction these days."
5,Best Comic Book adaptaion to date!,"This movie was directly adapted from the graphic novels of Frank Miller. The movie story-boards consisted of the.... graphic novels... the dialogue was written by... Frank Miller's words directly out of the graphic novels. Artistically, this movie felt like a graphic novel. Filmed in Black and White with a splash of color here or there to accent specific elements.Movies like Spider Man and X-Men are very good movies... but do not hold true the comic world. This movie does and it looks and sounds great with a great cast. This movie is definitely going to be a must have for me!"
5,A keeper,"This will no doubt be one of those films that you will play over and over and will be talked about for years to come.With the bulk of the film in black and white,bits of colour are thrown in and really intensify a scene.I'm sure we will now seen more films done in this way."
2,Good cinematics. Degenerate story.,"This movie exhibited interesting cinematic creativity. This visual interest is as far as the movie's value extends unfortunately.There is no redeeming value to the storyline. This movie revels in perversion, sadism, and immorality. This is yet another movie in these troubled times that only adds to the fire and will further twist people's minds.Let's support good, wholesome, uplifting movies and art! When we focus on these things, then people's thoughts will be on these things. Inline attitudes, thoughts, and behaviors then result.Let's not wallow in this filth."
2,All about style and special effects. But where was the story?,"The film is all about style. It is a comic book brought to life.At first I was intrigued. The characters are larger than life and the plot is about the hero trying to find the killer of a woman with whom he spent one romantic night.The film is shot in black and white and uses color to make its point. Blood is always red. And so is lipstick. Eyes are green or blue. And there really is a yellow bastard. The acting is good too and the sets complement the film.However, Sin City lacked one important thing - a story I could get my teeth into. The special effects and style overshadowed everything. And I was left wondering what all this was about. I watched this film for over an hour, hoping that it would make some sense. Finally I fell asleep.Perhaps this film would be interesting to film students. It certainly is a departure from the norm. But I need more than experimental techniques to hold my interest. I need a good story."
3,"Theatrical or Episodes, not extended theatrical","First of all, I give the film 5 stars, that said, the blu-ray is only worth 3.Why? Because the best way to veiw the film is as a film, not as 4 short films. Yes, it's great to be able to veiw both ways, but, why is the additional footage not in the feature-legnth cut? The extended version is not a complete film, it's each story re-edited to separate short-stories. It's not the same tension or experience as the theatrical cut, which would be improved by the added footage.Now the blu-ray quality is there, the film's AVC @ 22.mbps average, and the DTS MA is nice though I have yet to grasp why DTS MA is 24/48 and not 24/96 (truely thunderous audio!) Still, it's a visual feast, an excellent film. If you have the 2-disk DVD edition, this is the same thing, exactly, in hi-def.Certainly worth the hi-def upgrade, but lacking a true extended cut."
1,uh...dud,goods: stylebads: everything elsethe eye candy-look wears off when the first sentence is uttered.overall: no thanks
1,Could I Give This Zero Stars?,"This was copiously awful movie; one of worst I've ever seen. I highly advise you to give it a miss. For me the worst part was the dreadful, dreadful waste of talented actors who are forced to speak silly, stilted dialogue amongst overpowering scenery. Truly bad!"
1,The longest peice of trash not to see,"The only reason i gave it 1 star was because of the visual vibrance of color. This movie is complete trash, it had no story whatsoever. It was too long and too boring. This movie is more for the guys because there is so much female nudity, i as a female, do not care if a film has nudity, but this film as unneccisary nudity. The lack of a plot really made this movie make me want to leave the theater, i could not wait until it was over. it is very comic book style, because the action, and blood bath scenes look so fake and ridiculous. Certain actors like Elijah Wood, do not fit the role they were cast in. in all, the acting, no plot and no story, and the unneccisary nudity makes this film an utter piece of mindless trash."
4,Review of Sin City DVD with book,Since I played the Judge in the movie I look for items now and then from the movie and found I didn't have this particular item. The book was in good shape as was the DVD. It arrived in a timely manner and if asked I would do business with this person again.
5,I loved this movie,"I really liked the movie. My husband did not care for it, but it enteratined me and enjoyed the twists and the changing stories. I thought it was different from your everyday hollywood movie and would recommend to anyone."
5,"Forget the effects, the script is great.","This film has achieved what no other comicbook superhero remake film has ever achieved. An intelligent plot and an interesting script. Even though this film depends largely on it's amazing and unique special effects the script does not fail in intising the viewer either. At first the film would appear to be one that appeals to the effect loving star-wars fan, but after watching you will be pleasantly suprised to see that it has quite an intelligent plot. What this film managed to achieve is a completely lack of the glamour which makes nearly all remakes terribly predictable, I could describe the film as a visual interpretation of a Tom Waits song.So if you're looking for a film that finally gives that goodie 2 shoes superhero a slap in the face, this is it."
2,"Not a review, but a comment.","I loved Sin City. I thought the style and cinematography were genius. However I have to say, I'm getting a little tired of these bare bones DVD's that come out months before the big Uncut Unrated Extended Deluxe Never Before Seen Director's Cut Version is released. Why can't they just release the good version and the barebones version at the same time? Give people an option, and give them a break while they're at it?"
1,"GREAT movie but a BAD dvd, dont fall for the double dip","Remember this is a DVD review not a movie review. This DVD gets a 0. Why? It is the typical bare bones release of a great movie. People will buy it, but will soon realize that the DVD is horrid and has no special features at all. Then a few months later another one will be released. Typical hollywood and thier double dipping. Do not buy this version. Wait untill the special edition. You know it is coming.Hope everyone reads this."
5,"Great Movie, don't buy the DVD!","I'm a huge fan of Frank Miller's and I loved this flick. I'm not going to waste time and space ranting about it. However, I will say this: DO NOT BUY THIS DVD! Yup, you heard me. Let me say it again: DO NOT BUY THIS DVD! It's a single disc with no real extras to brag about. Sin City 2 is slated for release in 2006. That's when they'll come out with the new ""Special Edition"". They're trying to get your money twice; don't fall for it."
4,"Very, very, very cool","Cool. There's just no other way to describe ""Sin City"". From beginning to end, it was just COOL. I've read the comics and the movie is those pictures come alive and moving. What can I say? It's just so ... so ... so COOL!!!!"
4,Has recut and theatrical versions,"""Sin City"" is now on Blu-ray on two discs. One disc has the ""Recut"" version which adds about 6 minutes of story content, and also presents each story as a separate feature. There's not a big difference between this and the theatrical version. I think the theatrical version flows nicer, because it blends the stories together, so I recommend that for a first viewing. I enjoyed watching the ""recut"" version as a second viewing, because it's changed just enough to keep it feeling fresh, like listening to a favorite CD on shuffle."
3,"Great Movie, but lackluster recut edition","This is a great movie for those of you that have or have not read the graphic novels by Frank Miller. However, this edition really leaves a lot to want. Yes, it has a few uncut and extended scenes, but they are not placed into the main movie format. They extended version is separated by story arc instead of molded into the theatrical version. However, the book the DVD comes with is a fun read. If you really liked the movie, like I did, then this might be something to consider. I bought it because it came with the graphic novel. I was not disappointed about that."
5,"IT'S A SINFUL, GUILTY PLEASURE FROM START TO END","I WAS SO RELUCTANT TO BUY THE DVD, AFTER READING ABOUT THE GORE, AND GALLONS OF BLOOD, ETC. I WAS A FOOL-IT IS A GREAT ENTERTAINMENT, WITH BRILLIANT ACTING BY THE ENTIRE CAST, GREAT DIRECTION BY ROBERTO RODRIGUEZ, WITH BRILLIANT CINEMATOGRAPHY UTILIZING COLOR MIXED WITH GREAT BLACK AND WHITE! TALK ABOUT YOUR NOIR FILMS-THIS RANKS ALL THE WAY UP THERE WITH THE BEST. THE DVD IS BARE, EXCEPT FOR THE BRILLIANT, HILARIOUS, SHOCKING FILM, BUT THE MOVIE WAS ALL I NEEDED! THE DTS SOUND WAS REMARKEABLE AS WELL. LOVE IT OR HATE IT, YOU MUST SEE SIN CITY-YOU CANNOT HELP BUT BE ENTHRALLED AND ENTERTAINED FROM BEGINNING TO END. BRAVO...................."
1,Terrible Movie,"Without a doubt one of the all time WORST movies ever made. There is nothing at all positive to say about this film. Between the terrible plot, horrible acting by EVERYONE and the most difficult move to watch because of the bizzare filming style I want to give it a negative rating, but they do not allow this. Not even worth buying to use as a frisbe."
1,the casual humdrum of death and male ego...yawn....,"Where are the intelligent and creative masses that yearn for expression other than the casual humdrum of death and male ego???...yawn.... Boring! This movie is made for unintelligent 19 year old boys who are filled with frustration, anger, and of course hormones. I may also add the few 40 year olds hiding out in the darkness of their dens while their wives and children are sleeping. Please....Please...Let's get creative without the use of ""Hos"" and extreme graphic ""violence."" Are male comic-book authors so dull in their senses? This movie was crap! May I restate ""was."" As it quickly faded to a distant hiccup of a memory... now it simply ""isn't."" Good Day Sir...I said Good Day! ;-D"
3,Deserves 3 1/2 or 4 stars...,"But I went with 3 because of the hype this movie gets- some attention it deserves and other attention not so much. This movie just seemed to be almost desperatly trying to be cool. A movie that ""cool, enlightening"" kids and/or adults would love. Being in High School at the time of it's release it seemed every ""popular"" kid loved this movie. I mean maybe I have a bias, but it's just I didn't think it was that good. It's long, it jumps storylines with little connection and it overall is too ambitious for it's own good. I mean I love movies of similar sorts such as Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction, but this movie just was a bit too much for me. I think it's worth renting (although it's on Starz and HBO now to my knowledge) and I will see the second, it's just not as good as people make it out to be. Will most people actually like this movie? I doubt it. Great cast, great director, not so great story line = OK movie."
4,Buying for Significant Other,"Nothing I've bought -- or will buy -- is for me. They are for a Viet Nam Vet who is slowly dying of Agent Orange poisoning, is confined to wheelchair due to combat injuries, and has currently become interested in Blu-Ray.He's asked me to buy specific Blu-Rays of late, the first one having been from Amazon. He reimburses for all purchases. I will do anything and everything to make his rather short time on this planet as pleasant as possible. After all, he is my dearest, best, most wonderful and most significant friend. Wish I could do more!!!Peace, Doris"
1,Beyond words......,".....I would like to use. I found it to be gross, violent and the story (if any) was boring and unconnected. My biggest amazement was, that high quality actors would want to be associated with."
1,This Movie Sucks Donkeys,"Seriously, this movie sucks so bad, there should be some kind of reverse Academy Award for it. I don't understand why Bruce Willis agreed to be in this steamy turd of a movie, because he is a good actor and he's been in some really good movies. But this movie is dumb, and it's so violent that it's ridiculous. And the directors seem to be unable to decide if they want to make a live action movie, or an animated movie, so what you get is a weird combination of both. It was ridiculous how the characters in the movie were so hard to kill, especially Marv (Mickey Rourke). And the movie had cannibalism in it, and people being hacked up with saws. And Nick Stahl's character had his sex organs shot off, then surgically replaced, then ripped off again. And Nick Stahl had become this ridiculous-looking yellow man with a round, bald head and yellow skin. It was so stupid!"
2,Rosario's Dawson sucked big time in this one.,I have never seen an actor so in over her head. Rosario was so over-the-top that it ruined the movie for me.
3,"ok, but it didn't knock my socks off like it did so many","Did you guys know there was an invention a few years ago called color television? So what if it is a comic strip? Did you know its cheaper to make a movie in black and white? Quentin Tarantino is laughing all the way to the bank on this one, and don't give me the ""he was experimenting, trying to make a comic book, made a revolutionary new idea"" statement. The old 70's spider man series did this concept ages ago.Anyway. Some of the mini stories are interesting, some where silly or boring. I am not a big KillBill fan either. I like Quentin Tarantino when he does stuff like ""from dusk till dawn""Sin city might be worth watching once, but I would not see it again. Loved the violence though :)"
1,WTF???????!!!!!!,".....I GIVE THE MOVIE 4.5 STARS ITS PRETTY DAMN GOOD....BUT HOW DARE THEY RELEASE A NEW VERSION JUST TO SQUEEZE A FEW MORE BUCKS OUT OR HARDWORKING CONSUMERS???....I BOUGHT THE PREVIOUS EDITION WHEN IT CAME OUT EXPECTING SPECIAL FEATURES AND WAS DUPED...I'M SO PISSED... I STILL WILL BUY IT....GRUDGEDLY...THE ""MAN"" SUCKS!!!!!!"
1,"Technically clever, but for sick minds only","This is only the second movie in my life that I have walked out of (the first was Andy Warhol's Chelsea Girls, which bored me to death). I have to admit that the creation of the comic book atmosphere is well done, and the acting isn't bad within the requirements of the plot. What turned me off was the over-the-top non-stop sadistic violence, and the total lack of any character that one could empathise with. The film works startlingly well at creating its sick dirty world. It just isn't a world that I think any mentally healthy person would want to spend time in.PS Judging by the percentage of people rating this review as unhelpful, I guess only fans of the film are reading this review! Well, it's your mind..."
1,The first film I ever walked out of,"Okay, so I have to be honest. Maybe I can't really review this film.I have sat through a lot of bad films and I usually make a point of not walking out but this is the first film I ever walked out on. I do not object to the violence. What bothered me about this film is that when characters basically cannot be injured by weapons, I don't care what happens anymore. I like films where the appearance of a weapon makes me tense. In this film characters can get shot repeatedly without being killed, so the appearance of a gun no longer becomes thrilling.My point is that, ironically, the excessive violence of this film made it one of the most boring films that I've ever watched."
1,Gross and dull...,"which makes this one of the worst movies I have had the misfortune of viewing. Who cares if the visuals are stunning--there is barely a plot and the characters are repulsive. You just don't care about them *at all*. I couldn't even finish it. If you want stunning visuals get Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. OK, so it isn't blessed with a great plot, but who cares--it's beautiful to look at and has way more charm. And unlike Sin City you won't get nauseated watching it."
4,Grand Pooba,"It was a great movie for about 20 minutes, then the B&W; novelty with a spash of color wore off, I wish he kept it fresh like Miller in the comics. There could have been something in the final arc that wowed us like certain visual effects in the begining.Could have been much better.Topmooin' it"
1,Absolute TRASH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Sin City is an empty, hollow, incoherent, poorly edited, pathological piece of snuff porn; it tries to gloss over this with lots of beautiful camera work, but it's just like putting a silk dress on a rotting corpse. Each of this movie's stories are so morally childish they seem as if they were written by sixth-graders. None of them are truly coherent, nor do they make any real sense; there is an almost total lack of real human emotions, motivations, etc., that would explain the Road Runner-like violence. The acting is so hammy and heavy-handed that even if it were intended as a satire on the whole film-noir shtick, it still fails miserably. The horrendously bad dialogue would have been funny if it wasn't for the film's violence, which, by itself, speaks volumes about its creators as well as the people who praise this stinking piece of trash. Great stuff, if you think like Lynndie England."
3,"Interesting Movie, but...","This was an interesting movie, and the plots were ok, but it wasn't the greatest movie i've ever seen. I thought the plots got kind of repetitive and monotonous after the first couple of stories. Not to mention it was really depressing. So, overall, nice try, but I wouldn't reccomend this to anyone who isn't a die-hard Tarantino fan."
4,blame it on pineapple,"Bored one afternoon,pretty and adventurous Jessica decides to enter a pineapple recipe contest that she has found in a magazine.A few months later she finds that she has won for having made the weirdest pineapple treat the judges have ever seen.The prize is not a lifetime supply of pineapple as she and her twin,Elizabeth,feared.It is a trip to Hawaii!!Excited,Jessica is soon heading to Hawaii with a handful of her many friends.But what none of them expected is for their vacation to be such an odd one.Long story short!,Janet becomes convinced she is a princess called Keiko,Lila believes she has been cursed by a piece of jewellery and Lila has had it up to here with her father's blonde girlfriend whose name is Bambi.(she would love to Thumper).It is just a very fun and amusing novel that is great for kids and young teens."
3,This is the new age form of the Kabbalah.,"I do not care for this book, and I am the first to admit that the more I study the Kabbalah; the less I seem to understand.However; I do know real Kabbalists, and will say that they never heard of the ""Path of the Sword"" in ascending the Tree of life glyph.According to them; there are 22 paths connecting the 10 sephiroth together; and people may use any of the paths to go from Malkuth and ascend toward Keter (if memory serves the name of the top sephiroth on the tree of life.)I encourage questions and comments about my reviews; Two Bears.Wah doh Ogedoda (We give thanks Great Spirit)"
2,"Boxing Day, a One-sided View","While Jeff Wells does an excellent job capturing the tenor of the times he does Tommy Burns a grave disservice in treating him as the bad guy of his story, and Johnson the great hero. Burns could have done what previous holders of the heavyweight championship had done, and flatly refused to give Johnson a shot at the title. But, unlike the others, he allowed Johnson, a black man, his big chance. It was Johnson who turned his back on his race and denied similar opportunities to Sam Langford, Joe Jeannette, and Sam McVea. Jack Johnson was a talented fighter, but not much of a human being."
3,A Different Dandy Album,"Make no mistake about it, this is different from 13 Tales and Come Down, and sometimes change is both good and bad. The songs ""The Last High"" and ""We Used to Be Friends"" are two of my favorite tracks in any kind of music. ""The Last High"" is a trippy, but undeniably catchy song, one of my all-time favs. While ""Friends"" is just a great ""hook-driven"" rock song. ""Plan A"", and ""Heavenly"" are the other good songs on this album while ""Rock Bottom"" is decent. The Dandies have lightened up a bit as the guitar is not as heavy and the keyboards have become more of a focal point. I loved 13 Tales and Come Down as albums, but this one just isn't as good overall as those two. This one has great individual songs, but not enough other material to make this a great album. This is a decent album, but not great. Its one of those CD's that you just listen to a several songs then change the CD. I'd suggest just buying or downloading those 5 good tracks and the rest you can skip over."
3,"Love the music, hate the format","I really should have educated myself as to what ""enhanced audio CD"" format means. The case says it ""contains exclusive access to THE ODDITORIUM -- the Dandy Warhols' secret site where fans can see band web casts ... "" but I don't care about that. What I want is to be able to rip and convert the songs so I can listen to them on my MP3 player, and I don't see a way to do it when the CD is in this format. Can someone clue me in?"
5,One of 2003's Best Albums!,"The latest album from the Dandys is something totally different from the group. 'Welcome to the Monkey House' is like a previous reviewer has stated steeped into the best bits of 1980s music. Yet, it still somehow manages to sound like the Warhols. It's an outstanding album and every track is wonderful, you won't be skipping any. This is one of the strongest albums of this year. Very Highly Recommeded!"
5,BORDER OF GENIUS,"Dandy Warhols repeatedly amaze me. each album finds them spreading their wings, throwing caution to the wind and consistently forging their own path. i'm lost for words - this album forces me to have faith in music all over again, when music has gotten completely cookie-cutter, unoriginal in recent years. I truly don't know what to say except for F**K YEAH!!"
2,I want my $17 back,"After hearing a few of the awesomely catchy songs by the Dandy Warhols (""Boys Better,"" ""Cool Scene,"" ""Not if You Were the Last Junkie and Earth,"" and ""Bohemian Like You"") I was hooked on the addictive sound of the group. So I took a chance and decided to buy the new album instead of 13 Tales From Urban Bohemia. BAD choice. ""Welcome to the Monkeyhouse"" sounds like the Warhols were forced back to the 80's and aren't very happy about it. The sound here isn't trippy, it's just narcotizing. It pretty much put me to sleep behind the wheel. The CD captured all of the annoying synth sounds of the era and none of the power. As one reviewer noted, if I had wanted to listen to some new wave, I would have bought the real thing, not a tired tribute.Some reviewers seem to think this CD has merit becuase it's ""experimental""-- well, that's fine, but I wish the experiment came with a cash back guarantee."
2,It's Alright in the Monkey House,"These guys have the corner on strange listen to me if you are curious music that most of the time makes you wonder if it makes sense, or if you are really entertained. I bought it for the theme song from Veronica Mars, We Used to be Friends, which is a great tune. I find it hard to find anthing else that matches up to it. I have muddled through it, but wish I would have found it elsewhere"
1,Better off playing Slabtown.,Believing their own hype the Dandy's have quickly descended from an innovative bunch of rockers to hey we're BOWIE. Wrong! This album sounds like it was made with an ancient synth and a microphone. The Last High is OK but one song an album does not make. One more like this an these folks will be back at Slabtown wondering where it all went wrong.
4,CPM,I thought this was a terrific album that was very well produced but different from the earlier music.More commercial...Hard core fans might not approve....
5,I love this CD more than life itself!!,"because life before the Dandy Warhols was full of sadness and despair...;-)It IS a radical change of sound for them but they've pulled it off because well, everything the Dandys do is cool. ""You Were the Last High"" is an instant classic, one of the most gorgeous tunes they've ever done. I didn't think they'd be able to top 13 Tales either but I took an immediate liking to this CD because it reminds me of the music I heard when I was sneaking into nightclubs underage in the '80s (only better...)"
4,Pick This Monkey Up!,"By far one of the most under-rated and under-recognized bands in America, the Dandys have come through with yet another cache of truly original songs that will spin around in your head for days to come. At first listen to this album, I thought maybe Monkey House was a little ""too"" catchy but after a couple of more listens, I smartened up quite a bit. This is quite the album that is truly enjoyable to listen to from beginning to end. I found myself just wanting to listen to the songs without constantly advancing to the addicting ""The Last High"" or other highlights such as ""Scientist"", ""We Used To Be Friends"" and ""Rock Bottom"". This album is sonically meaty, with much to sink your teeth into and savor. Give your ears an especially euphoric and funky treat you'll find yourself going back to again and again....pick this CD up immediately!"
3,Now I know what happened to Love and Rockets!,"Maybe it's too soon for me to be giving my opinion on this release since I've only had it a for a week and listened to it about four times. It's a bit of a departure from 13 Tales, which is what I'd expect from a band w/ such potential. Less guitar and more effects...where I'm having trouble is about half-way through there are a number of slowed down, drawn-out tunes..sort of loses momentum. But this is where maybe I feel I need more time to get used to the disc and what they're going for here. Best tunes are the last track, and 'We Used to be Friends.' Monkey House could be lost Love and Rockets album from the late 80's..."
3,From Heroin to Bubble Gum,"I should have saw it comming after the GAP used ""Bohemian"" for one of their ads. If I didn't like this band so much I would really rip this album but I respect that they are evolving but I don't know if I like the direction they are headed. Imagine if Love and Rockets made one more album and sang falsetto 60's bubble gum music. This would be it. Don't get me wrong, the album still has reminents of they're past sound like the first three cuts and the very last two but somewhere in the middle I think they just they miss the mark slightly. The track Scientist, what the hell h appened there? If you're a fan get the album and support them but keep the classic earlier albums as you're real fix if things get too La-la sun shiny."
3,"More Commercial, Less Intersting","""13 Tales From Urban Bohemia"" was always going to be a tough act to follow, and the band waited three years to do it. The wait is over for the fans, and what we have received is a disappointing album.The hard edge that has marked the band's previous albums is gone, and we are left with a sound that is, above all, more commercial and less interesting. There is an obvious change of direction due to Nick Rhodes' presence, but why delve into pop electronica when the rhythm section of this band is so tight?This is not to say that the album is bad. We are still talking about the Dandy warhols, and they are one of the best bands making music. But this album begs the question: have they already peaked? If so, then this is a probably a good indication of what is left in them."
2,Hey Courtney...,"Concentrate more on songwriting, less on filmmaking. And what's wiith the bong hit thing? That's so Beastie Boys. Come on."
2,Very Dissapointed,"I only recently discovered the Dandy Warhols about 4 months ago, when i bought 13 Tales From Modern Bohemia (a little late seeing as it came out in '99), and these guys got me into the whole indie scene (of which i have so many albums to be thankful for now, thanks guys). That album was so good, it played through incredibley with great instramental music, and each song worked into the next, something i haven't been able to appreciate since Pink Floyd. They took everything i loved about them and fed it to a really fat women along with a couple angry crabs, gasoline, a live blender, and out she [vomited] this. WHY WHY DID YOU HAVE TO TAKE THIS DIRECTION. Now about this album itself, there are about two-three good songs, nothing great, and definitely not a solid album. In short if you loved the Dandys last CD be set up for a dissapointment. The Dandy Warhols, R.I.P. this day of our lord, August 19, 2003."
1,Save your ears.,"I'd rather listen to someone puking for 17 hours than to ever have to listen to this prefabricated, push the buttons, robotic schlock again."
1,copy protection,"Sounds fine on my CD player, but it (a) completely freezes up my desktop and (b) has distorted playback in iTunes and WMP on my laptop. Also sounds like crap when I try to rip it for use on my iPod.Conclusion: don't even bother.[...]"
2,Not Dandy,"I bought this albumn in hopes of something a little greater. I first heard this band off of some soundtrack, and thought it was really catchy, but when i then purchased their newer albumn a week later, I was greatly disappointed. I don't say this about many albumns I own, but I believe it was a waste of money."
5,Now Classic,"Here I am rewriting the mean, negative review I spat out way back when this record came out. Boy o boy did I hate it! But then I grew up. My reaction was like a lot of the other haters. I wanted another ""13 tales"" and I did not get it. WAAAH!. After gradually going back to these songs over the years, I noticed that not only had I accepted Monkey House, but that I really loved it. It is funky and psychedelic and it rocks. I'm sorry for leaving that bad review up for so long. DANDYS RULE."
2,Welcome to the Mental House,"After the killer releases Thirteen Tales from Urban Bohemia (which made Country good) and Come Down (throwback to British Rock), the Dandy Warhols come out with ""Welcome to the Monkey House"". Gone is the country-rock, gone are those classy hooks and stoner-like grooves - now the Dandies have brought Duran Duran and other 80's like sensibilities to their world.When this CD is good - it is brilliant. ""We Used to Be Friends"" is 80's throwaway pop at its best. But when the CD - it is just plain boring. Some tracks like Plan A seem to go on forever.Overall - this is disappointing that it is a Dandy Warhol CD - considering their heritage for making classic CDs, tinged with a bit of sexual ambiguity.But this is plain boring. Dandy Warhols - what went wrong?!"
4,almost perfect,"I've been a long-time Dandies fan and am digging this album. Yes, it's a sure departure from previous material, but a welcome change none the less. While the album is steeped in the 80's-brand sounds of keyboard driven bands like Duran Duran (Nick Rhodes produced it) and the like, it still feels relevant to today. Courtney does some cool voice-work on this album, but I miss the trademark Lou Reed-ish song that we have heard on each of the other albums. Still, the collaborations with Bowie and Dando are impressive, especially ""I am a scientist.""Each song, however, is worthy of repeat listenings!"
5,The Dandys Reign Again,"Take your favorite record from the seventies, breed it with your favorite record today, and behold the Dandy Warhols phenomenal new album, Welcome To The Monkeyhouse. With tight production and a unplaceable sound, this record will change the way that you look at music as an idea, they way you want music to sound, and will indefinately rock your world. The epic and intelligent Dandy Warhols know that That is what music is all about. Rock."
5,Very Nostalgic and Enjoyable,"An extremely excellent and enjoyable account of New York radio sports from the 1920s to today with an occasional side journey into the national scene. A must read for anybody who grew up in New York during the ""Golden Age Of Sports"" or for any media/sports junkies!"
2,Just The Facts,"Mr. Halberstam has written a great book for someone doing a research project on a history of early radio. As a person growing up in the New York area, I found it very dry and, unfortunately, repetitive. Information from the section on World Series broadcasts was repeated in sections on the Dodgers, Giants, and Yankees. (Perhaps the author doesn't expect anyone will read it from cover to cover.)"
3,Fancy,This is a beautiful accessories bag. The Color is Rich and the Suede material feels nice. It is loaded with great compartments to hold alot of items. Great for persons who love Stationary and Offices Supplies and needs a place to store and keep it properly organised.
4,Elliptical Masonic mysticism,"Bro Wilmshurst's volume is regarded with awe by many Freemasons, and not without cause; there are many deep ehtical ruminations here. The book suffers from the Weltanchauung of the late 19th Century, when everybody reading was presumed to be an Englishman, worried about classical philosophies, and a Trinitarian Christian. The book suffers from repetitiveness (I surmise it to have been a collection of previously-delivered lectures and speeches) and 19th Century grandiloquence, but nonetheless proves to be a worthwhile addition to most Mason's libraries.Just make sure you donate your copy to a local library when you are finished with it, so that students and scholars may form their own opinions; it might be shelved with Freud and Jung instead of Nathan Bedford Forrest.Remember also, Bro Benjamin Franklin's acute summation of ""The Mysteries"": ""the big secret is that there IS no secret""."
4,The Meaning of Masonry,Most enlightening I did not know just how deep this secret organisation feed into most parts of UK and USA politics' very worrying stuff!ThanksSteve
1,"Only for Masons, if at all!","I am an active Freemason and reguarly read as much on the subject as I can. I must say that this is one of the worst books I have read regarding Freemasonry. I think a lot of it has to do with the time it was published (the last century). Even for a Mason, the reading is slow and dull. Save yourself the time, don't read this one."
1,thin and no substance,"The title says alot I my expectations were high. Too bad they were not met.After reading pages after pages I sit with the fealing of getting very little substance and my notebook has barely any good points worth writing down. If you want to know the message freemasonry teaches and how they use the symbols, there are far better books than this. Some of those books are even free."
1,Not worth the read if you are 'searching'!,"This book was originally published in the late 1800s!!!! If you want 'out-of-date' pro-Christian, totally biased wordage then this is the book for you. The dust of the ages still cling to this 'resurrected' edition. It should have been left to RIP! It does a great disservice to the Fraternity, presenting it in a light which should be hidden under a bushel. I give it (1) as I personally acknowledge that all written material merits something. This book does have covers after all! A UGLoE Mason."
1,skip this badly written book,"Nothing in the on-line description of the book nor on the flapscan prepare the reader for this mishmash of 19th century prose and repetions in what is actually a series of lectures delivered???There are no dates, or explanations for the writing in these verbose, boring lessons."
4,Very insightful and thought provoking,This book is a must read for anyone interested in more than just a surface treatment of masonry. I found this book more insightful and thought provoking than many others I have read concerning free masonry. Oh that other organizations could take the principles to heart.
5,Awesome Family Movie,So rare to find a family movie where there isnt death or violence involved. I love this movie and so does my nine year old. Very wonderful message in the movie. Bought my daughter the orignal Free Willy and she was bored to tears. But not this movie..a big thumbs up!
1,Free Willy Escape from Pirates Cove,I purchased this movie twice and neither one of the times did the movie download. I have not been able to watch the movie because it doesn't download. I am extremely disappointed as it was a waste of money!!
5,FREE WILLY,I AND MY WHOLE FAMILY ENJOYED THE FREE WILLY SHOW DVD WAS IN VERY GOOD SHAPE WE WATCH IT ALL THE TIME. IT IS A VERY GOOD SHOW FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY. ALLEN
3,Free Willy: Escape from Pirate's Cove,"While I had never seen this particular movie, I thoroughly enjoyed it as I have each of the Free Willy series. The friendship between Willy and humans is so precious and shows the incredible intelligence of this mammal. It makes a person fall in love with his heart. I'm grateful for wholesome movies that can be watched by anyone."
3,Best for the Very Young,"I was excited to see a movie with Bindi Irwin; she is lots of fun, like her dad. But this movie .... good actors but I didn't find it to be as, well, professionally done as I expected. Willy surely must have been, at least at times, a mechanical baby whale. I guess maybe it was a low-budget film? I'm glad I saw it once. I don't feel a need to see it again. Little ones might watch it over and over. They are not so particular."
2,The Orcas were disappointing,"I was disappointed in this movie. I don't think they used ANY real orcas. Willy was either computer generated or plastic. It was not believable for moment. The graphics were horrendous! However, I m glad that they did not make little Bindi interact with a real whale especially with what happened to the Sea World Killer Whale Trainer but they could have made Willy a little more realistic looking. Bindi is really a cute little girl but she can't act!"
2,Poor Durability,"Kong 'Wobblers' hold up very well, but THIS ONE DOES NOT LAST. Sure, Dogga loved it, but in a month it was torn to pieces.Kong Company wake up: Your products are not cheap- if you get greedy and turn out junk, your market share will dwindle, and you'll be pushed aside.Ciao!"
1,Nothing like the original kong,"I don't like this toy. It's an odd shape, doesn't roll and a weird space for treats. You have to break the treats up to get them to fit then they just fall out! Don't waste your money!"
5,"took a few tries, but now he gets it","got a rescued adult dog, 3 years old. he was used to playing with plastic bottles and dog bones. this toy was almost a flop. he wasn't sure how to get the treats out and i pretty much gave up on it as a mind challenging treat dispenser. however, my dog walker stuffed it before she left and when I got home, he got so excited and grabbed the ball and began chewing it. when treats came out, he got super excited and chewed even harder. i watched him continue to play with it for the next twenty minutes. he pretty much got all the treats out of it and now he understands how it works. since that day, he enjoys playing with it.so don't give up! they will figure it out if you keep trying."
1,Kong Stuff a Ball,"I pushed several *cookies* inside this Kong Stuff a Ball for my 11 month old Rottweiler. 15 minutes and he had the end chewed right off it! I thought these things were near indestructible? They are supposed to be made for your dog to have to work at getting the cookies. Mine just ate it! For the money, I could have bought him 2 or 3 cheaper toys to eat."
2,Not for aggresive chewers,"I have a brutally aggressive chewer (35 lb springer spaniel mix). She rips toys apart with her incisors. She ripped the tabs off around the hole opening in a few minutes. She has not done any additional damage to the main body of the ball. I am sure the ball would be great for normal chewers, but the tabs around the hole could not stand up to my beast."
2,Not durable for a dedicated chewer,"My 5 month old Lab pup has chewed this in half after only 1 week. If they make it of the ""Extreme Kong"" material I'll look at them again but my pup (who has her adult teeth in now) needs a more durable product"
2,Dog likes it but was ruined in minutes,We got this for our 9 month old beagle. He liked the toy but with in minutes he had already ripped a sizable piece of the end. We took it away from him and returned it to the store.We have had other KONG toys and had always been happy with the performance but not this time. I'm wondering if they have changed their QC or MFG process.
3,"Not for so-called ""bully breeds""","I've got a 1 year old Am Staff Terrier that tore this product apart in about 15 minutes. The entire item is still fairly intact, but the flaps that keep the treats inside were lost and recycled within minutes of him getting his paws on it. I gave 3 stars because the flaps are a little flimsy for strong chewers. I wish they made this product in the black Extreme line."
4,stuff a ball,It would have been nice for the ball to have a smaller hole to limit fall of normal dog food.
3,Kong is not as good as solid one,"My German Shepherd doesn't like this kong as much as the solid one she has. She loves to play ball, but won't work hard to get it out of this toy."
4,cleans teeth well,"cleans teeth very well but if you have a serious chewing dog it will start to break apart eventually (two weeks of a couple hours a day). i knew that the red kongs were not the strongest but i like how it cleans their teeth so much that i will just keep ordering more. amazon sells these for about half the price of anywhere else. if nothing else, keep one of these on hand for occassional use for teeth cleaning and let em really chomp on the black traditional kongs."
5,A favorite,"One of Tilly's favorite toys! I put baby carrots inside the ball, and then use a plastic baggy with the tip cut to squeeze peanut butter into each crevice. This keeps Tilly occupied for a long time, and isn't messy!"
1,not durable for any size dog,i got this kong and the medium kong for my doxie..she ripped it apart in 10 min..not durable for any size dog
1,Dog destroyed it within 30 minutes,The toy lasted about 30 minutes. Not much more to say than that. I obviously wouldn't recommend it for anyone.
3,"Better than the norm, but","This product withstood my dog's chewing, except for the ends, and now it is open ended, won't hold treats, but she like to play fetch with it."
4,Bigger than I thought,"This listed the dimensions as 5.3 x 3 x 6.8 inches but when it came was larger than what I expected it to be. My dog has the smaller one and I measured it to figure out which one to order... I guess I measured in a different spot. anyway, my dog wore out his smaller one and we wanted to get a replacement for him... I had to give this to my Mother in law's black lab as this was way to big for my 15 lb. dog."
5,My dog LOVES this ball!,"Give my dog Shana a soft toy and in 30 seconds it will be shredded, unrecognisable, and spread from one end of the house to the other. Give her a tennis ball, and 2 minutes later it is gone.I bought Shana a Kong Stuff a Ball with the hopes that it would last her more than a day. 7 months later, the ball is still intact, and is her favorite toy!When I fill the ball with the special peanut stuff that I bought with it, it keeps her quiet for hours while she tries to lick it out. I have started filling the ball with treats, which she enjoys getting out. We also use this ball to play fetch with, and it is so durable.I can't believe it has lasted as long as it has. It still looks new, and has only a few minor teeth mark indents which is hard to believe! Although the ball seems expensive, it is worth it because it will last 100 times longer than anything else.If you have a pet that loves to chew, the Kong Stuff a Ball is for you!!! (how poetic)"
1,Does not hold up to a strong chewer,For my dog this toy did not hold up at all. I have a weimaraner and was looking for something to put treats in to keep him occupied while away from the house. We had to throw the toy out because he was chewing off pieces and swallowing them.
2,not strong enough!,i bought one for my 10 pound maltipoo...he chewed the top off in less than a hour ! spent 8 dollars thought it would be more durrable..now lookiing for a better toy help??
3,Great until....,"I bought this toy on a recommendation from my father. I have a 7 month old pit mix puppy who is a destructive chewer. At first it seemed like a great toy. Originally I used the puppy treat spread that comes in the can by kong. while my dog loved it, it made the ball a mess to clean. Especially on the outside. So I started using other treats inside. Everything was fine until there was a treat that he couldn't get out. So he worked on it and chewed the hole until he actually chewed through it. Took him about 15mins once he realized he couldn't get the treat. So for a regular chewer this is ok. For a dog desperate to get his snack, its no match!"
2,ball,this was a little hard and uninteresting to my Great Pyrenees. but to a more energetic dog it should be great.
3,Our beagle dog was entertained for like 10 minutes :(,Was looking for something to entertain our lazy sweet beagle so I ordered this among a few other things for her. She was excited and played with it for all of 10 minutes then became bored and it's been laying on the floor since. Maybe if I hide it then bring it out again she will play with it some more. Wasn't the toy I imagined it to be for her. I'll keep looking for the right one.
4,"I have 3, two large and one smaller","I have three of these balls, I also have 3 dogs. A DDR German Shepherd at 96lbs, a 60lb Husky mix and a 45lb Collie mix. The two smaller dogs love these toys. The shepherd (Blitz) saw me lightly toss the ball and treats fall out so Blitz will pick up the toy and throw it against the wall. HOme and toy still survives even today. Great way to keep dogs happy on a rainy day or before they go to bed. These can survive in my house I know they are built to last."
3,Mixed results,"This toy would have been okay for our pug/terrier mix, but it didn't live long in the mouth of our German short hair pointer pup. He's demolished any toy of this red material, but his big black super kongs live on and on."
2,Love all Kongs except this one!,"I have had several Kong toys for years. They were worth every penny! I was excited to see this one and bought it as soon as I could. This was supposed to be a highly durable toy. Blah! My 1 year puppy had it in 1/2 pieces within 2 days. Huge waste of my $20. I bought mine at a store. If you have an aggressive chewer, the ridges enticed my puppy to eat until he got to the chewy center!"
3,Not as durable,"I usually have great expectations of Kong products but this fell a little short. My rottweiler managed to chew and enlarge the hole at the top of this toy within minutes, thereby destroying the challenge of getting treats out."
2,Lab-tested and failed!,"I usually love Kong toys, but I was disappointed in this one. My 1-year-old Lab chewed pieces off the end within 10-15 minutes of receiving this toy, so I cannot use it to entertain him while I am at work as I had hoped. At first, I was excited to see that he had to work a lot harder to get the treat out than he has to with most treat toys, and he was enjoying himself! Once he got frustrated enough, he started taking pieces off the end, trying to get to the treat. This might be a great toy for dogs who are not aggressive chewers, keeping them entertained for a while, but it doesn't work well for my doggy."
2,"Formulaic, cliche-laden manuscript doesn't thrill","I admit to making it only through the first 100 pages of this collection of formulaic plots and characters. Essentially this book is a collection of cliches, one laid atop another.It's a dark and stormy night - literally - and the German submarine launches a spy - a woman, just to give it a modern twist - into the sea. On shore, a man and a woman acting as shore patrol steal a bit of touchy-feely (can't have a man and woman together without sexual tension, right?) and then terror strikes.Off in the English Isles, a man with a deep, dark past is teaching others how to kill . . .It doesn't take long - perhaps a half-dozen pages - to realize that you've read all of this before in other novels.The characters are not only paper-thin, but retreads as well. The plot is so overblown and so filled with holes that it is impossble not to trip over the potholes.Best to pass this one by.Jerry"
1,"Expected historical fiction, got quasi-military thriller","I wasn't familiar with this author, but heard an interview where he discussed this book. He mentioned that he reconstructed the last few months of FDR's actual life to see how an assassination attempt might have fit in fictionally. It sounded like the focus of the book was FDR's last days, with an assassination plot woven in. Just the kind of historical fiction I'd be interested in.However, I've read over 60 pages and am giving it up. FDR has barely been mentioned. The dialogue and description have a modern flavor, rather than putting you back in the 1940's. There are none of the details of everyday life one would expect in historical fiction. The guns described in an early chapter almost have more personality than the human characters.It is what it is, probably a good thriller if that's what you're into. But if you heard the same misleading interview I did, you ought to know that's what it is."
4,Bit on the Dark Side,"I got this book because I so enjoyed ""The Devil's Waters,"" the first Robbins book I read. However, ""Assassins"" doesn't seem to be anything like ""Waters"" and starts out very darkly with the macabre murders of two civil defense volunteers in New England. I started it, then stopped and read another WWII mystery, ""Billy Boyle,"" then came back to it. I'm still not finished. One thing that drives me nuts as an editor is that he repeatedly uses the phrase, ""alright,"" instead of the grammatically correct ""all right."""
2,So much promise at the outset; so so little after it,"AG starts out well. Very well. Vividly, excitingly, pulse-poundingly well. The writing is entertaining, the story fast-paced. That's just the beginning, though. The great bulk of AG is given over to cliche characters and a highly contrived story. These would be excusable in a novel of the genre if they weren't so bloody predictable. I listened to AG on the daily commute. The first tape was a shot of caffeine straight to the veins. The next 10 or so tapes were a cup of hot milk on a humid day as the doldrums set in. In a word, boring."
3,Needs a good editor,"I wouldn't comment except I see so many 5 stars and wonder why. Yes, this is a fairly interesting book but I couldn't wait for it to end - and that's never a good sign. I thought it started to drag in the middle and for a while I thought it would never end. Then when it did end I couldn't believe the ending. I don't want to spoil the ending but it just doesn't fit the character of someone who trains assassins. Because the history was interesting I give it 3 stars but as far as the overall story I think that's generous."
5,great for class,"I use this every year in class. I also teach instrumental music and the DVD is very informative. Goofy host that the kids love to hate/make fun of. I have nightmares about PJ, AAAHHH! Anyway, it's the best instrument series i've seen for elem. school"
3,Ink runs out way before the paper,"This is a fine little printer for 4x6 prints. And if it actually delivered anywhere near the stated number of prints per pack, it would also be economical. Because I don't print a lot, my ink runs out way before the paper does, leaving me with stacks of useless paper. Epson does not allow you to buy ink without also buying paper, so you are stuck. Other companies selling ""compatible"" ink cartridges are selling dy based inks, whereas the printer is designed to use a pigment base. So 3rd party ink solutions are not the way to go.If you print out several times a day, you may not have this problem. But I use the printer very occasionally, and for this usage volume I cannot recommend this printer."
1,Beware of Bait & Switch Tactics,"We purchased a new unit that was defective and we contacted Epson as instructed by Amazon's Return Policy for this item. We were sent a refurbished replacement for our new unit priced item instead of either a new unit replacement or the option of a refurbished unit replacement at a reduced price. Because of this experience, we will probably purchase all our new electronic equipment from a local store where we can get what we paid for should a problem arise."
4,Great for what it is supposed to do,"First let me say, I have a real 13"" printer by Epson and do all of the color matching and correction when using it.Problem is that the workflow on the larger printer really doesn't meet the workflow needs of the wife.My wife has been using the picturemate for a year now and we have gone through probably 600 prints. It has been well worth it. The photos are exceptional.My ONLY complaint is the cropping it automatically does to fill the entire 4x6 when doing borderless. There really is no fit option on this printer to get it to print the entire original image for images that don't match the aspect ration of 4x6. But, it only bothers me and doesn't bother my wife.Looking at the user manual for the new version of the picturemate with the picture viewer, it looks like they have solved this problem on the new version. Because of this I would recommend getting the version with the picture viewer display."
1,I would not buy,"I purchased one (from a local store not Amazon.com), brought it home and printed a photograph that I had previously printed on a Kodak EasyShare printer (my mother-in-law's). The resulting photograp was horrible, it had a very green tint to it. I then adjusted the various enhancement controls within the printer, the green tint remained. I checked the troubleshooting section of the manual, checked/cleaned the print heads, and still the problem remained. Given that the product is still on the market, I suspect I had a broken unit.I did not like the LCD, it is very hard to read. I adjusted the contrast but it did not help. [...]."
2,crops about 6% of your photo without wanting it to,"Beware if your buy this printer or a newer version. This printer will crop your photos about 6% without you even wanting it too, it just does it automatically. Even after adjusting it, it still crops. Usually cutting off the tops of heads, not so when you have them professionally printed."
5,Epson PictureMate Personal Photo Printer,It was just as good as the one I have on hand. I would tell my frineds about tis web sitechuck
1,This is an old version of the PictureMate,"We bought this thinking it was the newer version of the PictureMate then the one we had. I cannot believe an older version is even still available much less for the price they are asking. It does not even except a 2 gig SD card, it is slower then a snail. I would think the price would be more like 50 bucks versus 200+ bucks. We are attempting to return it and so far the seller is asking if we used it or not. I hope we can return as of course we used it otherwise I would not know about the SD card limitiation or the slowness. This is the first item I have ever had to RTN that I purchased via Amazon.Pat Hinde"
1,Item not as described,"The item was suppose to be new, however it was obviously used. The box was demolished, ink cartridge was dried up, and the paper was already used (gone). The printer was dated from 2005 and the used ink cartridge 2006. We tried purchasing a new ink cartridge from Epson, but unfortunately not even that worked. The item was so old that it wouldn't recognize a modern day memory card. Nonetheless, the item has been returned."
1,Did not perform as expected,"I received my Epson PictureMate Photo Printer as a 2004 Christmas gift. It printed the first 14 pictures very well. Then it started printing in poor colors, even though the ink level registered 75% full. I cleaned and aligned the print heads as instructed in the manual, but still no success. My regular printer was an Epson also, before it developed mechanical problems. I have since switched to a Lexmark Z25 which prints my photos and regular print. I will not use Epson again."
2,Waterproof Claim doesn't Hold Water,"Epson claims photos printed from PictureMates are waterproof. This oft repeated claim is blatantly false. I'm disappointed that professional reviewers haven't exposed this farce. Newly printed photos seem to have some waterproofing but that quickly disappears. Test it yourself. Simply place a drop of water on a months old photo, wait a few seconds, gently mat the paper. The result is a ruined photo. How is that waterproof?I bought this printer because of the great quality (true) and waterproof photo feature. I'm really disappointed with the waterproof claim. They've duped us all.Kudos to the other photo printer manufacturers for not following suit with equally false claims. It must have been tempting to do so."
2,"PictureMate Dash, cheep looking prints","I have been using my PictureMate Dash for several months now and have finally put it in the trash. Since the beginning the print quality has been mediocre with horizontal lines and continual color shifts.These are generally resolved through head cleaning and alignment, but both of those have never fully fixed the problems. They certainly don't prevent them from coming back.With the expensive cartridges and the inability to stop using cartridges once they have been started is very frustrating when you are trying to resolve quality problems. I have tried a new cartridge on many occasions and found out it was not a cartridge and couldn't complete the use of the cartridge without wasting the newly tried one.If you want to be running diagnostics all the time and have 50 cent pictures, the PictureMate is for you."
3,Wish it had a big LCD screen,Not a bad printer but for $199 I could have purchased the HP 375 model that has a generous LCD screen to preview my photos. Plus I hear the HP model prints faster.
2,I don't care for this printer,"This photo printer will crop your photographs regardless whether you cropped or not. The person that you photographed will have their head cut off! if their head is close to the edge. Make sure you have plenty of empty space between your subject and the edge of your photo before you send it to print. In other words, don't have your subject fill the whole photograph. Have your subject centered with plenty of room because it will crop top to bottom and left to right - all sides. Like said before, this printer will do this regardless whether you choose to crop or not."
1,Doesn't Perform as Advrtised,"After about 3 cartridges, it started to print in dark blues and greens only. After a cleaning, it printed one picture correctly; the next was also dark. We cleaned it again; it did one good one and then started to print dark again. I threw the printer away. Due to the high cost of the cartridges, $35 per picture is too much. The printer was kept and used in a clean environment."
3,Espson PictureMate Printer,PictureMate generally does a good job. Instruction booklet leaves a lot to the desired!!! Contact with manufacturer near worthless. Plan to use up much time/materials to finally figure out all the many features built into this unit.
5,MY FAVORITE TECH TOY!!!,"This printer is THE best! Someone wrote about the cropping. I had that issue until I figured out how to use it. No offense but it's just a common thing in the tech world. This printer absolutely prints to the edge just like a photo lab. It is AWESOME without a doubt. I showed them to my friends and they could hardly believe I did it at home. You can cut, crop - make photos black and white or sepia toned and the quality is just brilliant! The ink cartridges last great. I printed 150 pictures from a trip to Kauai and it didn't miss a beat. Yes, it is a little on the slow side, but by the time you factor in drive time to and from dropping photos off to be developed and the fact that you have to develop the whole roll even if you don't like half the pictures- this printer is the way to go."
5,Picturemate exceeds my expectations,"I've had a love-hate relationship with EPSON, the Stylus Color IIs I had was nothing but a letdown. However, I bought their Stylus Photo 1280 and I have been very pleased with it.After some extensive research between the HP and the Sony PictureStation I found that the Picturemate was a no-brainer on paper.Not only did I set it up in less than 10 minutes, but I printing too. All the cards are supported, the prints are borderless (no need for those hideous rip off tabs like HP used) and the quality is nothing short of exceptional.The 6 color ink system blows the three color dye-sublimation of the HP out of the waters. The Epson PictureMate is highly recommended."
4,"great pictures, but.....","The pictures are unbeatable in quality, but the 100 prints from an ink pack will never happen. I got about 20 pictures from one pack because most of the pictures had blue in them and it ran out of blue, thus making the ink cartridge useless. Havent sent it back yet to see if they live up to the replacement guarantee."
4,PictureMate Printer,"I loved my PictureMate for about two years. It made great pictures and I used it frequently. After using it for about two years, it needs to have the heads cleaned almost every time I use it. It is not as much fun to use when you have to remember to do that every time. My daughter had this problem with hers from the beginning."
4,not really 2,"Be aware that although the ad description prominently indicates you will get 2 speakers, ""(2)SPEAKERS"" really means one speaker bar with 2 internal speakers, not 2 speaker bars. However, the sound from the speaker bar is very good and it is a perfect fit."
2,HUM appears a few months after purchase,"Now, the SR705 is a beautiful receiver. I got one about a year ago and it was silent and clean running (warm 'though). But about 2 months ago a HUM appeared and remained no matter what I did, including disconnecting EVERYTHING except one speaker and trying every other outlet in the house and turning off everything else in the house. Everything. I sent the unit back for repair and four weeks later it came back from the factory. The HUM was still there, as loud as ever, maybe louder. I'm going to have to take it back again and probably exchange it for something else. It's unusable as is. I've researched the blogs [...] and apparently (although I didn't know it before I bought the SR705) this HUM problem has shown up on units more than a few months old. What's wierd is, the factory 'fix' didn't fix it at all."
5,What More Could I Want?,"I have been into home theater for well over 5 years, but this receiver, my first Onkyo product, has pulled everything together for the first time. The Audyssey system quickly evaluated my listening room with the tiny microphone and arrived at a perfect sounding equalization, balance and matching of my mismatched speakers to where I am really hearing surround at last! Since I am not using all 7.1 channels, Onkyo allows me to re-assign 2 of the amplifiers to bi-amp my front speakers.. how cool is that? And the receiver is able to convert HDMI, component video, composite, and S-video every which way so no component is left out in the cold. If I can figure out how to reconfigure the volume knob to where it doesn't take 5 turns to get up to high volume, I will be totally amazed and satisfied with my purchase!"
5,Awesome Receiver,"I decided it was time for an upgrade from a 10+ yr old sony receiver. After extensive research, i decided to throw caution to the wind in terms of heat gerneration and the idea that this model was being discontinued. I took a chance on the 705. It arrived Wednesday and all I can say is WOW. What a difference. I have connected a PS3 and a uverse decoder with the output run to a 56"" Panasonic HDTV. I am using HDMI cables throughout. I have it set up in a 5.1 configuration for now but will soon be adding the additional speakers to achieve the 7.1 experience. Time will be the ultimate truth teller in terms of performance but the early reviews in my media room at outstanding."
4,Compatibility with Samsung DVD VR375,"This player has a lot of bells and whistles and haven't had the time to really learn about all it can do. So far I'm happy with it's performance but my issue now is where I'm hooking up a Samsung DVD VR375 DVD/VHS player that is capable of upgrading signals to 1080P. The DVD player hooked up to my Onkyo will only play audio and no video. When the player is hooked up directly to TVs, it will have video. When I hook up other players via HDMI to the Onkyo, it plays perfectly with audio and video. When I ask help from Samsung and Onkyo, they point fingers at each other and I have no resolution. I even have another model Samsung which played fine though the Onkyo. When talking to Onkyo and Samsung, it seems like they are only interested in their sales and not fixing the problem."
5,Excellent Value...,"After extensive research, I purchased this receiver because of the superb feature set to cost ratio. It provided all the HD audio options one would need as well as three 1.3 HDMI inputs. Setup was ""relatively"" easy but was a little daunting given this was my first AV receiver. Performance is excellent once setup and exceeded my expectations. This device does produce a surprising amount of heat so plan accordingly when contemplating placement options. All in all an excellent value and ""future proof"" given the features, a best-buy in my book."
2,Problems with the SR705,"I bought the TX-SR705 thinking it would convert my regular definition video from my DVD player and the low def channels from my cable to high definition. After trying to get it to work correctly for two weeks, I finally gave up and wrote to Onkyo tech support. What they said was that if I wanted to get the high definition feature, I needed to buy the SR875 or the next one above that (for $$$). I also had several issues with the lip sync changing from one day to the next. This was probably the biggest reason for returning the unit. I don't mind setting the lip sync once but having to change it every day is a pain.On the plus side, the auto speaker setup was great and the surround sound (I have a 6.1 speaker setup) was great. Hopefully the Sony that I'm replacing the Onkyo with will be equally as good.Bottom line: I know that a lot of reviewers ranked the SR705 very highly (that's one of the reasons I bought it) but I did not have a good experience with it."
1,HDMI Hum,Very prone to hum due to HDMI connections. With my old house wiring I didn't want to have all my equipment and the TV plugged into the same outlet but with this receiver such a setup can cause HDMI loops and will introduce ground loop hum. Supposedly the 805 doesn't have that problem but I would stay away from Onkyo products due to this problem.
3,Heat Problem,"Just replaced my Onkyo TS-DS696 with this unit. Sound quality is much better than before BUT I may be sending it back. In the standby mode, the unit still produces quite a bit of heat which my other unit never exhibited. I called Onkyo support and they indicated that it was normal, which did not seem correct to me. I went to two local locations Circuit City and Frys and tested the same unit in the standby mode. The receivers remained at room temperature. I may just have a bad unit and will exchange for another Onkyo receiver. I still love Onkyo products and will give them another try."
5,GREAT Receiver to have!!,"I've owned this receiver for about 4 weeks now and couldn't be happier. I have the Bose Acoustimass 10 speaker system connected to this receiver and the output is really crisp. Setup was a breeze with the Audyssey speaker setup. The thing I really liked is that you could change the values for the individual speakers if you aren't totally satisfied with the automatic settings. I hardly go beyond -15db (max is +12 i guess) and can already feel the walls shake.Also, I love the option of customizing pre-set listening modes for different inputs. I have my DVD player connected to it through HDMI and the receiver automatically switches between DTS, Dolby Digital and Dolby PLII modes depending on the audio stream from the DVD. The learning remote is the only one I use to operate my TV, Cable Set top box, DVD player and the receiver.No heating issues, no clicking, no audio lag. A must buy for anyone looking for a receiver in the $600 range."
2,It only lasted 1 month,"Price was right, lots of nice features but after a month it stopped passing 1080p video to the tv. Had to send it in to onkyo and it is going to take another month to fix it. Sounds like they're backlogged fixing their junk! I wish I'd bought the Denon!"
5,Onkyo TX-SR705,This receiver fits my needs perfectly. I have surround sound in the great room and speakers in all of the other rooms as well as the front and back patios. I am able to play music from any media in all rooms and patios while still watching TV with the surround sound in the Great Room. And this all from one receiver.
3,zone 2 ONLY PLAYS analog input,"I totally agree with all previous reviews but I want to add one detail that totally boggles my mind. When I setup my outdoor speakers I could not get any sound out of them and tried everything. Until I read the trouble shooting section in the manual that states: NO Sound, Zone 2? ONLY COMPONENTS CONNECTED TO ANALOG INPUTS CAN BE PLAYED IN ZONE 2"" so if by chance you want to use your XM/Serius MP3 digital player in multiple zones, you cant! IPOD connected? nope that wont work either. I ended up running RCA cables into the receiver from my MP3 player (weak sauce considering what i just paid for this thing). I just upgraded from an old Yamaha that did this just fine. I am not going to return it because i am pretty much invested in the thing now. If I had to do it over again I would like to have known this up front. I am still in shock..."
4,Good so far,"Had this new receiver a month now and am very happy with it, will take a while to figure out all the bells and whistles but overall am satisfied with the functions and remote control setup. Sounds silly, but the only gripe would be too many choices for the listening mode , slowly figuring out the best mode for each piece of equipment and application."
4,All I expected and more,"Bought the product from Vann's and I could not be happier with their service. The receiver has performed flawlessly and provides excellent sound when paired up with the Bose speaker system we use. Set up was easy and very accurate, just make sure the kids are entertained while the system runs its diagnostics as the speaker will pick up any of the noise and stop the process. All in all, with no interruptions, it was 15 minutes from box to play. Only drawback is the heat the unit generates which is substantial in a closed cabinet. At this price point this unit is very hard to beat and the HDMI and S-video ports along with the ability to expand allow this unit to keep pace as the technology evolves. No hesitation in recommending this product."
5,Great receiver for video / audio needs,"I have had this product for about a month and this receiver gets the job done. No change in video via hdmi since it is a passthrough I have no loss in 1080p. I have hooked up 7.1 surround and the sound is real good. I grew up in the receiver era that you will see Dolby Digital, DTS logo on the receiver. Most of today's HDDVD, Blu-ray players decode the signal at the player and it will display PCM MULTI HDMI logo on the receiver which it is the same sound and there is no loss in sound there. There are a wide range of surround formats that you can choose from. The remote is big with alot of buttons, but with alot of options, that works for me. You can display temperature on the receiver if you have concerns about the heat. No problem there. The speaker's auto calibration is cool. Hooked up PS3, Toshiba A3 HDDVD player, Time Warner DVR and it all plays beautifully. Overall, it is a good investment present and future."
4,Good receiver,"Hi, I bought the Onkyo 705 in April 2007 for $522.00 I had a 5.1 receiver previously. I had wanted a receiver that was up to date with current technology and I feel that Onkyo delivered that to me at a fair price. My only grip is trying to understand how to coordinate the speakers I have to be effective when using the 7.1 modes and I really can't tell if the THX rating really makes a difference, but that is probably my own hang up. I would have given the Onkyo 705 five stars but I don't like how it runs so hot."
2,Not as clear as it should be,When comparing to a pioneer vx27thx it does not have the sound quality you I would have expected for hdmi connections and 7.1 sound.The clarity was just not there even with a blue ray player.It did not have the crispness or bass for quality sound reproduction even with all klipsch speakers it was not good.The only good thing was the microphone that eases the speaker calibration.Thank God that amazons return policy is THE BEST!!!!!
2,The HDMI inputs failed after 10 months,"I got this receiver in Sept 07 and here it is July 4 and I have problems. Two of the three HDMI input ports do not function. The third ports sometimes works. I have reset and reprogrammed this thing repeatedly. I installed a DSP firmware upgrade with no benefit. I emailed Onkyo who sent me to warranty repair. I do have a local repair center but the delay for repair is four weeks, maybe six weeks maybe longer. The repair shop said there are lots of units in for repair. I again contacted Onkyo but got no reply to my complaint of a long wait. I found scattered similar complaints on Google.Until it failed on me, I had enjoyed this unit. I liked the computerized sound field setup. I like others found it a little weak in loudness.I cannot recommend this unit.Onkyo TX-SR705 7.1 Channel Home Theater Receiver (Black)I have owned many stereo receivers and this is the first one to fail like this."
4,Excellent receiver for the price,For my second media room I selected step down verson of Onkyo and I am not disappointed. It can produce quality sound I say 95% of what I get from first Onkayo receiver model #875 I got last year for more than twice the price. I recommend it highly.
5,Best Quality receiver for the money!,I bought this receiver after a long research period and found this to be the best receiver for the money. I had considered a yamaha receiver (663or863) but the features on the onkyo had me sold. The onkyo had more HDMI inputs and was THX certified. The sound quality is great since I paired it up with the definitive technology Procinema 600. I recommend this receiver to anyone that wants a quality receiver for a good price.
5,I'm Hooked,"Did not know joyce but this sounded different and I was board. MAN, she is a bundle of energy and a sack of fun at the same time! Bought a few others of her DVDs and she's the same in them all! When I want to get a laugh and a workout (which by the time you are done laughing the workout is over and you forgot you were working out) I pop this DVD in. She's great fun."
3,"This sounds a lot like Joyce's ""Speedy, Non-Stop"" DVD!","Based on Beth's review, I recognize many of the movements, and I'm guessing this new DVD is an almost exact replica of the ""Speedy, Non-Stop"" with perhaps an added exercise or perhaps a variation of a couple. I already have the Speedy, Non-Stop"" DVD, so I'm not inclined to ""re-purchase"" it through the Cougar Workout.Joyce is a very good instructor, though."
5,Awesome!,"This video is just awesome. Goten turns super saiyan, chibi trunks turns super saiyan, Chibi Trunks hits Vegeta in the face,videl learns to fly,goten learns to fly,Trunks and Vegeta train in the Capsule Corp space pod,and thats about it. Its a very good video for any DBZ fan."
5,simply outstanding,"I recently purchased her book through Amazon and wish I could get a hold of her newer book, ""Simply to Delicious."" I have thoroughly enjoyed using it to make some outstanding dishes that were simple and delicious. The recipes are creative and easy and take no time to assemble. An aside - the photography used in her book is amazing and beautifully demonstrates the finished products. A great find and a great addition to my recipe book collection."
5,Why not available?,"Can't actually say I've listened to all the mixes on the single, but I know they kick... D'ya like trance/euro with a few liricks... ...a nice song ? ...paul oakenfold...slacker... It'll beat your usual pop shet anyday. Gonna buy it now...F(UK)"
1,You Have Got To Be Kidding!!!,"$8.00 per issue???? They are only $2.99 a piece, and taht is shown right there on the cover in the picture of the product. Are these printed onGold Leaf????? Is this a misprint? Go to the distributor, or your favorite comic book store, or anywhere else. Just run from here on this one!"
5,The Simpson Comic,This is a request of my grandson and he absolutely loves sit. At age 14 he remains captivated by it. EJH
5,Vintage Americana Music by Country Music's best Quartet Ever,"The Statlers were always geniuses when it came to writing and selecting songs that painted portraits of America that all Americans can relate to. This album illustrates that beautifully. I am delighted they never turned to ""country rock"" whatever that is (whatever it is, it's not country) but stayed true to what they did best. Maybe that kept them from selling as many records as they might have, but their honesty made their fan base stay with them, and, thanks to us, they all have comfortable retirements."
1,Broke after 1 year,"My phone worked fine for over a year. Now the handset won't connect to the base. First, I tried the troubleshooting guide in the manual. Then I tried replacing the battery and contacting Uniden customer service. The phone still fails to work.Avoid this one."
1,Awful....Low battery life...,"I bought the earlier model which looks exactly like this one and has same features. This is one of worst cordless phone i have ever purchased. During conversation, it shuts of all my itself even when fully charged. I even replaced hte battery but no good.."
2,Uniden TRU 3466,"bgt the TRU346 after good reviews, memory dim but phone broke within a year, could not hear caller (they could hear me)often could not get dial tone, don't remember what tech support (email) suggested (chg battery, reprogram unit etc), didn't work anyway. Uniden brand name and the reviews on TRU3466 with speakerphone, gave them another chance. # sign on handset died after a few months (try using voicemail systems without the pound #)had to use speakerphone constantly for # sign key. Earpiece is necessity, move around my office a lot, works on and off now, lot of static or no reception at all. I also need earpiece to keep hands free (major reason for speaker phone as well).Bought two phones, less than two years, $180. Big disappointment.Will never buy UNIDEN phone again."
1,Junk,"This telephone worked perfectly for 1 year and then died as if programmed to not work as soon as the warranty ran out... phones should work for more than 1 year and after having tried numerous phones, all of these companies should be ashamed at producing such horribly made phones."
1,what the,"I just realised that I had purchased this item but have never received a single copy of this paper, total scam"
5,Excellent Read,"As a marine biology student studying migratory patterns of large species, i founf Tuna to be an invaluable account o this fish. I'd recommend it to anyone who fishes for them, or who cares about the plight of our fisheries"
3,Tuna,"Not a bad book but heavily skewed toward the East Coast tuna fishing scene, which is understandable since the author hails from New York. But the mistakes and oversights by the author are less forgivable. Missing figures and diagrams and referencing the same fish twice in the species description section (Sarda Orientalis) prevent this book from being recommended by me. A total of four total color photographs (including the one found on the soft jacket cover) is pretty skimpy considering the book's supposedly comprehensive intent. Give it a pass if you truly are searching for ""An Angler's Guide to a Great Gamefish""."
3,Pretty good fishing how to book,"Tuna is a good primer on the Tuna species around the world. Unfortunately, it doesn't go into enough detail on how to catch the critters! Overall, however, I would buy the book again."
5,The Best Book on Tuna Yet!,"Wow, what a book! I just finished it and can't say enough good about it. If you like fishing, fish, the environment, read it! You won't be sorry. Hope he writes another one soon."
1,Terrible,"Got the opener and charged per instructions. The first can I tried to open was a standard sized dog food can. The opener wouldn't pierce the can lid and the piercing arm broke off. I reconnected the piercing arm 3 times and kept trying, but it fell off all 3 times. I wouldn't reccomend anyone buy this product. I saw other negative reviews, but it was so cheap I figured I would try it. Next time I will take other reviews in serious consideration."
1,Junk,Do not waste your money on this item. First time I used it the lever broke off. I put it back on and tried again. No luck. Fell off again. After 3 times I decided this was a piece of junk. Do not buy this item!!!!
2,Difficult to hold,"We have other cordless can openers in the past and this one really disappointed us. While this may be a really great can opener, it is difficult to hold while opening a can. We also found it to be very noisy. I would not recommend this product to and older person."
5,Nice product.,"It worked like a champ for a few years. I broke it some how and wanted to buy another, but they are not made any more - very sad."
1,My Opinion!,"I can't get it to open a can as I can't penetrate the can, I am 86yrs old and may not have enough strenth in my hands. How ever others have tried and can't get it to work either. Thamk You, Vera Inman"
1,Hamilton Beach 76500 Walk 'N Cut Cordless Can Opener,Worst can opener I have ever had. Not worth the trouble to get it to work and does not hold a charge!!!!!!!! Don't waste your money.
1,VERY POOR QUALITY!,"NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE TO PIERCE THE TOP OF A CAN. OUT OF 50 TRIES TO MAKE IT WORK, ONLY SUCCESSFUL TWICE."
3,Nice Idea but needs work,"Having a handicapped person in the family made this product an ideal purchase. However, there are a few things that make it almost necessary to have another back-up can opener on hand. Firstly it's difficult to latch onto said can no matter how old or how many hands you have. Secondly the manufacturer recommends that you do not leave it connected to the charger yet it does not have a battery light nor signal so when you go to use it on a can, will and has on many occasions, just stop running mid opening. And putting it back on the charger does not open the can until a full charge has happened. You also cannot tell when full charge is since there is no light indicating full or no charge. It's a gamble every time we try to open a can. On the good side it is very tiny so it does not take up too much room on the counter. So that makes this a very CUTE unreliable handicapped for the non-handicapped item. Warning: Do not purchase if you are prone to fits and tantrums."
4,Great little gadget,"This is a really neat can opener. It is fun to use and the kids like to watch it in action. It is a little tricky to get started. The trick is to hold it completely vertical when starting the initial puncture, then it goes off on its own. I never had any problems like the guy who lacerated his foot. Just be careful to always stand it up on its feet."
1,Not pleased with product,"The knife on the can opener will not penetrate some cans, therefore it will not open them. Some can edges appear to be different heights which probably contributes to the problem. It never occurred to me that it would be unsatisfactory so when I unpacked it, I discarded the box and packing, otherwise I would have returned it. I am very unhappy with this cutter, especially as much as it cost and will shop around for another kind. Would not recommend."
1,HORRIBLE! Always keep a backup!,"I have had this opener less than two months, but I could have written this the next day and testified to how horrible it is. Even after having a full charge (24 hours), it only lasts 1.5 cans worth- it dies in the middle of the 2nd can! Whats even more irritating is that when it dies, it stays in a locked position on the can making it almost impossible to remove without flinging the contents of the half opened can everywhere...or worse- cutting yourself! FORGET making chili or anything that requires multiple cans. I opted for this opener after having multiple manual crank openers break on me, and I did not want a counter mounted opener because I did not want to dedicate one of my precious kitchen outlets to an opener...but even if I left this plugged in all the time, it still wouldn't do it's job!I cannot tell you the amount of frustration this stupid gadget has caused me. I just want an open can!"
3,Hard to get working,"This little can opener is hard to get working. I have a hard time getting it to attach to the can. Once it connects with the can, it works well. I can see kids being fascinated with it as it walks around the can. It recharges with a cord in the back. The last one I had recharged on a stand and I liked that better. If you have any kind of arthritis or pain in your hands, I wouldn't recommend it because you have to push down hard on the lever to attach it to the can."
3,Not as good as expected....,I love the size of the can opener... but the cutting unit tends to bend when using and you have to readjust quite often between uses. The concept is good... but its not as reliable as I had wanted...
2,Not for the arthritic!,"Looks like a cute little can opener, but it's awkward to use and definitely not for someone with small hands or limited use of their hands."
4,Perfect for Arthritic Hands,"I found this can opener to be perfect for use with my arthritic hands. It is hands free and is small and compact and can be stored easily in a drawer. The countertop models restrict you on the size of can and take up valuable counter space. I was surprised that when I needed a new can opener to replace a 15 year old one, few stores carried them so after shopping several with no luck I went online and found just what I needed at Amazon."
5,Great Can Opener,"Excellent can opener. Works as promised. Only improvement would be a safe cut feature that would leave no sharp edge on the can lid. Size is perfect. Just open the can and put the opener in a drawer or cabinet afer use. No counter clutter! Used daily, we only have to charge it every two weeks or so."
2,Still trying to get it to work,"So far I have not been able to use it as it will not connect to the can and start working, but I will try again."
1,Waste of money,It's very difficult or next to impossible to clamp down on a can. It's not worth the effort.
1,Save your money!,"I am mechanically inclined, but no matter what I did, I couldn't get this thing to open a can. As a matter of fact, I couldn't get this thing to stay together to even start opening a can."
1,do not buy,"Do not by any Hamilton Beach Opener. They have a faw in design and will fail to cut after some use. I tried working with company, I have done everything they've asked, including mailing in item and cost of shipping, but they will not refund or replace.Try another brand.UPDATE (Years later): I had to junk this one, plus another one with same problem. Junk Junk Junk If you have one, keep a manual one just in case."
5,Fantastic Can Opener,"I have owned one of these can openers for over 5 years and I just love it. It works great and fits snuggly in a kitchen drawer, out of the way, until I need it. I am ordering a second one, as a backup since mine is getting older and I know it won't last forever. Keep it clean, and it is a little workhorse!!!"
1,Hard to operate,This can opener is really cute but extremely hard to operate. It is so hard to push down the lever when you get it lined up on the can.
2,Not for me,"The reviews I read previous to ordering this were mostly positive, so I guess this is a really good little guy. (It looks like a cute, funny little guy.) It seems very strong so it's probably durable, and when I could actually get it to engage the can, it did a very good job and performed as described. I guess it's too strong for me, because I was able to get it to engage a can only twice, after much, hard effort to push it down into the can. I was cooking a big pot of soup and opening several cans. Finally, in exasperation, I tried to use my old, worn-out can opener, but it really was worn out. So I went out into the night to the nearest store I could find, bought a tall Hamilton Beach electric can opener that stands on the counter (model 76380), came back home, opened my cans and finished my soup. The cute little guy was sent back to its home."
3,There's got to be something better,"After having this for 6 months, I finally threw it away. It constantly would hang up on the cans, and then it was impossible to get it unstuck. Once it's stuck, good luck getting it off! If it was a standard size can without even a hint of a dent, then it did fine. I found myself fighting it more times than not. I'm now looking around for something better. I will say, it being cordless was a plus! I could put it in a drawer until I was ready to use it, and then bring it out. I charged it maybe twice, so it stayed charged a long time!"
1,Don't buy this can opener!,This can opener holds only a charge for one or two cans. Bought it as a replacement for another cordless can opener. The batteries inside are terrible and need to be constanly plugged in. I won;t be buying any more appliances from Hamilton Beach!
3,great for #10 cans!,I had bought one of these out a walmart for much more than here but lost the charging cord during a move so I bought this one figuring at least I can use the cord. Well the can opener doesn't work so great - not as good as the black one from walmart (both are same brand & style). But I'm keeping it around just in case something happens to the black one.before we bought this we were going through a can opener every 2 big cans we opened! we buy those big cans in the grocery store to save money but we actually lost money buying them till we got this can opener! needless to say we love it!! =)
4,inexpensive,Perfect alternative to some other way more expensive cordless openers. The rest of this is filler because i have to use more words.
3,Hamilton Beach Can Opener,I bought this can opener to replace another brand that was an automatic opener. The other can opener did not stop on its' own andwas hard to get the lid off of it. This opener worked great on the can and stopped as soon as the lid was cmpletely opened.The only thing I did not like was how hard of a time I had to get the openeer started. You have it positioned EXACTLY right on topof the can for it to start. Maybe it is just a coordination problem! It is a great product and I am glad I purchased it.
2,can opener,Returned because it was very difficult to use. Could not get it attached to the can. Had no problem returning this item to Amazon.
2,Too Loud,I find this item to be too loud and hard to get started opening cans...i would NOT recomend this product...
1,not worth it,The can opener stopped working within 3 weeks of purchasing it. I tried charging it but it still would not work. I would never buy this product again. I don't blame the seller i blame the company that manufactures the item.
2,not ideal for daining tuna.,"this would be a good product if opening something that doesn't need draining but because it cuts from the side it doesn't leave the ring from the lid in order to drain something like tuna, olives etc. I returned mine. Also, it is akward to lock onto the can to start opening."
2,How do you make this thing work?,"I try to attach this device to the top of a can and nothing happens. I keep trying over and over and over and finally it starts and does a nice job, running all the way around the can until it reaches the starting point and stops automatically. But let me tell you, I am totally frustrated by the time this happens, I dont know why it ultimately starts, it just does.I can't take it back, I have opened the box, used it to open 4 cans now, but it is not getting any easier. I will be buying a conventional electric can opener today. I would not recommend this for anyone."
3,can opener,This can opener is hard to get hooked up on the can. It works good after that. When it runs out of battery power it will not work with the cord plug in. You have to wait till its fully charged again to use it. I was making dinner and it ran out of juice and wouldnt work. I had to find a old hand can opener to finish making dinner. So I wouldnt really say it's very good.
2,Too difficult to use.,"Even when properly positioned,this product it is very difficult to activate. It requires two hands and more hand strength that others that I have tried. I ordered another kind which worked much easier. I hope to return it for a refund"
1,Piece of junk,"What waste of money. Very difficult (if not impossible) to get the edge of the can properly fitted and I had to remove and restart four times on a large can of tomatoes. What the heck has happened to good old American appliances, my previous Presto can opener last over 10 years, this thing is worthless right out of the box!"
1,Evil can opener,"This is the worst can opener I have ever bought. It's really loud, hard to set and the handle is so sharp it cut my hand. I was very disappointed for a Hamilton Beach product. Don't waste your money."
1,Buy the Gizmo,"I had read the reviews on this, and thought it would be as good as the Black and Decker ones I had gone through several times. It's not. Biggest problem is getting it to pierce. Runs great not on a can. It's particularly hard to do on small cans. Cuts okay if you can get it to pierce.I've gone back to using my old electric one."
5,Love it,I will admit it is hard at first to line it up right. But after you get the hang of it that little sucker just cuts on around the can so fast. It is fun to watch!!
4,"Purchased on July 11, 2003",I loved this can opener...for the small cost I paid 2 1/2 years ago it was worth it! After having about 6 months my daughter dropped it and it still worked wonderfully. Always left it plugged it for recharging. The only problem that occured was every once in a while the cutting blade would get pushed into the unit and i would have to take a butter knife to get it back out. Sad to say the rechargeable batteries just dies and now I am looking to purchase a second one!
1,Worst opener I ever had,"I'm sorry, I don't know what's wrong with me, or rather my tin cans, but I couldn't get this to work most of the time. I gave it one star because it fits nicely in a drawer. I'm throwing it out and shopping for a new opener as you read......"
1,Do not buy this discontinued product,"As a person with disabilities (have use of only one hand), I need ""assistive devices."" Instructions accompanying this product are completely inadequate. Even my two-handed aide was unable to operate it. Fortunately, Amazon's return policy saved the day by refunding my payment, providing a return address label, and reimbursed me for postage. No wonder Hamilton Beach discontinued its product.I went back to Amazon and purchased a ""batteries-free"" mechanical can opener that works perfectly with my one hand. It's called Chef'n EzSqueeze One-Handed Can Opener. And it's only $13 including shipping!"
1,Manual can opener works better,"I got one as a gift from a friend of mine & it's the same one her husband uses all the time. I have arthritis in both hands & had major problems in trying to use it... Once can is pierced it works like a dream. Problem is getting the opener to pierce the lid in the first place. I tried using it on 4 different days: the 1st time I finally gave up on opening the can; the 2nd time I spilled tuna juice all over me but it worked; the 3rd time it worked just the way it is supposed to; after the 4th & final time I tried to use it, I decided the manual can opener was really much easier & less frustrating to use even though it hurts my hand to use a manual can opener. As I said earlier, my friend's husband uses the exact same can opener & never has a problem, but after my experiences I wouldn't recommend this can opener to anyone."
1,do4es not work. very hard to catch on to can. I gave up!,This can opener does not work like the other one used to. Unfortunately you do not carry the model I have had for years! This does not catch on to can. I struggle with it and finally gave up.
2,Too many flaws.,"Very hard to hold if you have any kind of arthritis, hand issues. Hard to connect to cans and once it does pierce the can, be aware that it's not the kind of can opener that goes around the outside of the can lid in which you're able to reseal. VERY sharp and ragged cut. I also found I couldn't do low cans like tuna/cat food size.So wanted it to work because I was so tired of the battery operated ones jamming up when the battery decides to die halfway through the cycle.I hope this helps."
5,Mom loves it,"I got this for my mom on Christmas to replace her old, discolored, and loud can opener. She loves it!"
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"Thought I would give this product a try and replace my 15 year old Krups electric hand-held model #404. Can't find them anymore. Anyway, the Hamilton Beach is difficult to use and does not work the way the directions state. Making several attempts, I could not get the ""pierce-point"" to pierce the can. Anyway, I have sent it back. For all the frustration, I would rather use a hand held crank style."
5,Hamilton Beach Walk N Cut Cordless,This is the best can opener I've had in a whileHolds a charge for a long timeOpens quickly without messHighly recommend
2,Hard to Start,"Well, I am not as happy with this can opener as I thought I was going to be! While it does an excellent job of opening cans once you get it to start, getting it to start is still quite a problem. The small and thin ""trigger"" that has to be pushed down until it engages was not designed well at all. I have had my significant other try also and he has given up on using it. Sorry but since this is a major problem I can only give it a two star rating."
5,"easy, durable and dependable",I've had this item for several years now and it's exceeded my expectations. I only have to plug it in to charge about 1 day every other month. It is great! It's easy to fit onto cans and it even works on cans that are bent. After being dropped a few times the front popped off but it popped right back on and works like it did the first day it got it. I'm buying more for gifts for family members with arthritis.
1,Stupid design,This might work if you have hands the size of an NBA basketball player. For anyone else it is a stupidly designed piece of total and utter junk. Don't waste your time or money!
1,Look elsewhere,This thing couldn't even penetrate a large can and skipped about on a small can. This is going back to Amazon even though I have to eat the shipping charges. An e-mail to Hamilton Beach remains unanswered.
2,If you don't keep it charged you better have a backup,Cute little can opener that works well enough as long as it's charged. Unfortunately it won't work with the power cord if the batteries are dead. You have to charge it up after every use or it might be dead the next time you use it. Because it requires charging and you have no idea how much juice is left in the batteries it's kind of a hassle to get the charger cord out and deal with charging it up before putting it away.I would not recommend this device as the main can opener in the house. It might be useful on a camping trip if you have portable power that you can charge it up on later. Otherwise get a can opener that uses AC only and you'll not have to deal with dead can openers.
2,Hard to use,It takes two people to attach the opener and get it to start turning. I used to have a Gizmo and I went for a less expensive option. It was a mistake.
3,Not quite up to what I expected.,It is difficult to attach to the rim of the can and is very hard to activate the cutter' Wouldn't buy again.
1,Not a good product,"This can opener is one of the most difficult to use. Although it is small, it is very hard to get the opener on the can in order to begin. Once on, after much work, it does work without being held. Additionally, it will not work unless plugged in. When purchased, it seemed to be one that could be battery operated.Not happy and will look for something different."
1,Can operner,Doesn't work worth a damn. My daughter-in-law and I could not get it to work. Many attempts to operate it.
2,Noisy and doesn't hold a charge very long.,"In addition, it is cumbersome to get the can started. We used to have a Black & Decker Gizmo which was so so so much better than this opener. Too bad the Gizmo is no longer available. Not recommended."
1,Cordless can opener,Was not able to use after around 3 cans. Recharging was OK but the opener just did not have the torque to open larger numbers of cans.
1,Worthless,"It is clumsy, dies quickly and doesn't do a very good job of opening a can. I was really hoping for something small I could put in a drawer that would work well. This was not it!"
1,Too many drawbacks,"Bought this when the battery in my Gizmo gave out. Big mistake. The Gizmo had a modern lithium battery, which meant you could continuously charge it, the HB has old-fashioned NiCAD batteries, which you must charge and then use until completely discharged, meaning every so often (fairly often) it gives out on you in the middle of meal prep. The Gizmo had 4:1 leverage which was easy for my strength-impaired wife to use. The HB has pathetic 2:1 leverage which is difficult for even me to use sometimes. Yeah, the Gizmo is expensive (over $100) but if you need a can opener that seriously understrength users can use, it's the only way to go. I would NOT buy this can opener again... I will probably get rid of it before it stops working, it's THAT unsatisfactory."
1,Dream opener,"Well, I got a replacement without a sweat after 30 days. The tool worked OK right off the charger... Thats the only time. Actually it sounds very labored even when it works. That could be the problem, it just has a physical handicap by design. Anyway, the second one did the same thing. I charged it for a few days on arrival... Three or four days later it would not even budge a can lid... Stone dead. The dilemmas are these; you never really plan to open a can so it's not going to be ready and you don't ever want something endlessly plugged in so it works on demand- especially if you think the battery is funky anyway. Maybe its an old factory run so ALL the batteries have failed. Either way save your money. It looks cool but is a non-starter."
1,Hard to Handle,I don't have enough hands to make this work. Very difficult to hold and more difficult to get the cutting edge to pierce the can. I love the idea that it is portable.
2,Weak product,"I bought this because my wife has R.A. and she has problems with hand strength. This unit is under powered and it does not work on can goods manufactured in other countries.Overall, I'm disappointed with this product, but I can't find a good replacement. So we will use this until the bolts fall out."
1,A PIECE OF JUNK,"WE BOUGHT THIS, CHARGED IT AND TRIED TO USE IT.IT WOULD NOT PIERCE THE METAL RIM OF THE CAN, AND WHEN YOUPUT PRESSURE ON IT, THE CUTTING UNIT DIS-ENGAGED FROM THE BODY.NOT MADE FOR ANY HEAVY-DUTY CANS...WILL NOT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE."
3,Hard to use,"This is a real cute can opener because it is so small. When it works, it's great. But it is very HARD to line the can up to the exact spot to open it. Both my husband and I have a problem with the alignment and usually get discussed and use our old hand can opener."
2,difficult to use,"This can opener is not a one touch product. It is ergonomically not easy to use, takes a lot of time to position it correctly."
4,Very clumsy design,"Not ergonomic. I got it to help with opening cans as my arthritis makes this difficult in the wintertime. It is very hard to use and does not ""fall"" into position for use. I have a feeling I will really grow to dislike this tool."
1,A no good canopener.,"The on & off switch positivly did not work.After about a week,I got so disgusted with it Ithrew it in the garbage can.Thats what i thinkabout this product."
2,Didn't last long,It was kinda hard to use and after about 6 months it just stopped even though I always kept it charged. Since this is the type of product youmight take camping I don't recommend it because it's not reliable.I used it once or sometimes twice a day....no more so I really thinkit should have lasted longer.
1,Doesn't last,Lasted about 1/2 year before getting so slow it was stoping every 1/2 of a inch. Not worst it. Junk
2,Walk n' Cut cordless Can Opener,It is very difficult to get it on a can to open. I am afraid Iam going to hurt myself by usint it.
2,Hand Held Opener,"This is an unique opener in that it is one handed and battery operated, but I find it hard to hold it and start the opening process. I am a mechanic and still find it hard. Once started it does a good job of opening the can. I also found that it doesn't shut off automatically once the can is open, but I've never seen that in any opener. Just have to stop the action by releasing the switch."
2,Don't waste your money,"I bought this product for tailgating.It's small compact size made it attractive for a saturday ballgame tailgate partyHowever it fails to perform, on a full charge it will open only one can.Don't waste your time and money on this one."
1,one hand can opener,this can opener is difficult with two hands two hands. I have the use of just one hand and cannot use it. a friend tried and had difficulty with two hands . this can opener is a huge disappointment.
2,Stopped working after 3 months,"I bought this can opener for my daughter. She used it a few times over the past few months and now it stopped working. I have one of my own that works fine, but it appears that the quality is inconsistent."
2,good idea but more difficult to use than One Touch,I like the idea of this can opener and that it is rechargable instead of battery operated like One Touch. Also that it opens the can the conventional way instead of on the side like One Touch because the sharp edge is dangerous on One Touch. However it is difficult to position it and push the lever down on the cans to open them. I really struggle with it. One Touch you just place on top of the can and push the button. Sorry not to have a better review. I am giving the Hamilton Beach 76500 to two grandsons as gifts. They will easily figure out the way to use them!
5,Can opener,This a great opener. Works flawlessly ever time I've used it. I would definitely recommend this opener to anyone looking for an opener.
2,Disappointed and miss my Gizmo!!,This can opener is extremely difficult to get onto the can to get started and then is extremely loud once I finally get it on there. I had the Black & Decker Gizmo that lasted 6-7 years and tried to purchase another but much to my dismay it was not available anymore. I would NOT recommend this item.
1,Not worth your money,"This item broke before I got the message from Amazon to write a review. It got STUCK ON the can, after using less than 2 weeks. Worked well to open first four cans but with difficulty getting it started. It is awkward. I had read this complaint in the reviews, but didn't pay attention. Pay attention to the reviews or regret it like me. It went straight to the garbage!!"
1,can opener,An older person can not use. Do not recommend. I could not use it at all trashed it. Should have check it out first
3,Just okay,"It doesn't seem to hold a charge very long. I leave it plugged in, but after a few cans it already seems to be losing power. It works fine for me, as I don't usually have a lot of cans to open."
2,Disappointed,"Timely delivery but rechargable batteries won't hold a charge.. It'll open about 3/ 4 cans then completely dies.. The little lever is a bit awkward too. Once you get the hang of it, it's not so bad.. But I'd have to say the most frustrating thing is, it needs recharging after practicallly every use.. Kind of defeats the purpose of it being cordless, don't ya think?? Also very irritated when it dies while in mid cut, if you try to plug it in to finish, it still won't work until its been charged again.. Be sure to have an alternative method available."
2,Works well but doesn't last and no replacement parts,"We had fun with the Walk 'N Cut, using it occasionally for about 10 months. When it didn't work one day, I charged it only to find that it still didn't work. Opening it up revealed that the batteries had leaked badly. I called Hamilton Beach and they said it was a discontinued item and could do nothing for me. It's disappointing to have to throw it away after such a short time with no recourse for a warranty replacement."
1,Terrible Design,"I bought this can opener because it is small and cordless. However, my husband and I have a difficult time getting it lined up correctly to open can. It is especially difficult with small cans. I usually end up pulling out the old manual can opener after a few frustrating attempts. As another reviewer mentioned, the round shape also makes it fall off the counter easily. Watch out for small kids, pets and toes!"
3,Walk 'N Cut Canoper by Hamilton Beach,"Once you get this finally attached to the can, it works well. It's really a pain to get it lined up to make it work. Wouldn't buy it again, but will live with it for now and it was fairly inexpensive."
1,HB 76500 cordless can opener,"I had one of these for years, and it worked great. However this just dosen't fit the bill and will not hold a charge. So the handy self crank job is back"
1,terrible can opener,This is a terrible can opener. I cannot get it to work . Bought it at Christmas so I need to find out how to return it. I hate it and it is way too expensive to just throw away. However I hate trying to repackage it to send it back. I guess that's what I get for buying in online.
2,No Battery Life,"The concept for this can opener is cool and it works, but the internal non-replaceable battery cannot hold a charge for any amount of time. That means you need to charge it for 6 hours before you use it next. It also will not work while plugged into the wall. All the power has to comes from the battery and it just does not. Do not buy it unless Hamilton Beach upgrades the battery to something that can sit in a drawer for more than a day unused."
1,STAY AWAY!,"This product is junk. It worked maybe a dozen times, but didn't do a thorough job of cutting through the lid even then. And forget opening a short can like tuna - the opener is taller than the can, so you have to juggle the can in your hand to get the can opener to work. As other reviewers have noted, it's also hard to get the opener positioned to cut. But the worst thing is that the opener stopped working after about a dozen times. It started not holding a charge well, now won't work even with the cord plugged in. Thank goodness I bought it from Amazon and they allowed me to return it. I'd give it a zero if I could."
4,funny looking but functional,"Takes a little getting used to but once you do, you will be happy with it. It takes up so little space that I store it in a draw. I would order again when need arises."
5,Great Product,I have 2 of them becuase of 2 houses. Both work great i have only had to charge them 3 times becuase they hold a great charge.I love the removable blade for cleaning.One thing about it is hard to line up but i get it on anyway.I recomend this product.
5,Gets it done,"What a great little product. It opens any size can with ease, is simple to work, takes up little space and is easy to clean, a perfect choice."
2,Serious Safety Defect with the Hamilton Beach 76500 Can Open,"Do not buy for safety reasons!! I was initially pleased with the Hamilton Beach 76500 Can Opener until it started rolling off the counter. While of great utility, this is a case where the technical design is great but the stylist created a problem. The fact is that most of the can opener's case is round in shape except for two little feet that try to hold it up-right. If a heavy steel lid is still stuck on the magnet and the unit is placed on the counter, the whole thing will roll over. If it is close to edge of the counter, it will fall on the floor. Now I have a big cut in my foot from the steel lid that was attached to the can opener at the time. I reserve the right to cook in bare feet but now I have a big gash because of this product. I am asking my money back and reporting to this to CPS. They should have given the product a square shape to prevent this."
1,Save your money,I purchased this can opener and found it very difficult to use. My sister visited and couldn't figure it out so I had to show her. It dropped on the floor and now it will not work. It's better to use a cheap handheld can opener and use your brute strengh!
1,One star is too many,"This gizmo is a costly dud. The first set of test strips let me use it successfully twice. The machine insisted the rest of the strips had passed the expiration date. They had not. Then the last strip worked. I must have made a mistake, I thought, so I stupidly bought another $25 box of test strips. Now, the machine simply rejects the lot number which you must dial in. It will not accept even one of the new test strips. I emailed the company's ""customer service"" department. They eventually gave me a refund for the second box of strips.Do not even think about buying this thing."
1,"Good concept, cheap product","Just purchased this device. Followed instructions for setting up first test. When I inserted the Calibration key, as instructed, it dislodged the internal connection. The device is now inoperable. Cheap, cheap, cheap....not worth the money."
1,Lifestream went out of business-can't get strips,"This product did work fine until earlier this year when it became impossible to buy replacement strips. I have been contacting Lifestream for several months, by e-mail an phone, and can't get a response. I found out last week on a health forum that the company has gone out of business, due to lask of financial backing.Don't waste you time and money!"
1,Junk,"It worked a couple of times, if you can call giving numbers that were way off, working.After that, it just did not work at all.The manufacturer wanted $$$ to fix it even though it was just a couple of months old.Threw it to the trash. What a waste of money."
5,Claymation magic,"This DVD, containing 13 new episodes of Creature Comforts is a joy to watch. Like the original, it features claymation animated animals speaking dialogue taken from interviews of British citizens. The animation is beautiful, making the characters really come alive. The humor is typically dry, and like Wallace and Gromit, you will probably either love it or hate it, with no in between. The extras are a wonderful look into the process involved in creating such a work."
2,damaged case,The case for the DVD was broken inside and as a result the DVD moved around inside during shipping and scratched the DVD.
1,"Great Concept, Lame Execution","I thought it was cute & cleaver claymation. I was intrigued by the cover and the reviews. However, it was not funny. It is nothing more than listening to a bunch of British rubes drone on about bodily scars and the annoying habits of their roommates. It's as if they recorded the conversations of people taking at pubs. I have a life span limited to 90 or 100 years. I regret I wasted part of it on this."
2,Not really for kids,"Well, I got this because of the Wallace & Gromit connection. The kids (4 and 1.5) thought that the animals were funny, but were soon bored, because it's basically all interviews. Rather dry british humor that I thought was funny, but definitely went over the kids' heads. Oh well!"
5,AWESOME for kids and adults,"kids will love the talking animals - adults will love the underlying humor. ardman does it again - wonderful, somehow touching at what it is to be human....they take interviews of people and pair their dialogue with animated puppets through the wonder of claymation. very cool, for anglo-philes all over the world!"
5,"""I don't catch flies . . .""",""". . . because flies eat poo and I DON'T like poo.""One of the more charming lines from this brilliant series produced by Aardman (of Wallace and Gromit fame).The producers went out into the British population and conducted interviews -- hundreds of hours' worth. Then, they paired the interviewees to plasticene animated animal characters and animated them in a series of 15 minute episodes.One view is not enough, either, because there are a lot of subtleties within the context of each episode. I also liked the special features.Buy this DVD. Support Aardman. Have a giggle over and over again."
3,Average children's book,"Sister Bear has parked her bike near a tree and now can't find it. On each page she thinks she spies a part of the bike (seat, basket,...) through a cutout on the next page. Finally, after spotting several things that are NOT her bike, she does indeed find her bike parked beside a tree. On each page, a cutsie animal peeks through from the previous page, helping to narrate the story.The whole cut out/peek-a-boo theme doesn't work well at all. The rhymes aren't at all natural and don't have a good flow to them. The book attempts to teach differences between Sister Bear's trike and the other objects she mistakes for her trike. It falls flat. The cutsie animals don't fit well in the story, and actually create a distraction.There are definitely better childrens' books out there."
5,The Killer Rocks On Jerry Lee LP record,"This is Jerrys secord biggest selling LP record of all time There are too many stings for my taste, but still a great album, and also contains his # 1 hit Chantilly Lace ."
5,great video,My son was a student at Morehouse when this documentary was filmed and can be seen in the video. 14 years later my son remembers his years at Morehouse as some of the most important in his life and has formed many lifelong relationships from his years there. I only wish it were released in DVD form. It would make a great gift.
4,.......hmmmmm,Not a review....just pointing out that the reviewer who said that all good music comes from Britain.... well maybe you'd like to know that The Killers are actually from Las Vegas.
1,"Actually -5 stars, DONT RENT THIS CRAP!!!!","On the back it shows jack bussy with an axe. He is only in the movie for like 2 minutes. The story, plot, and acting is all pretty crappy. I suggest you rent evil dead 2, or wrong turn, Hell even Mary poppins, anything but this."
1,I want my money and my time back!,"I only watched this movie for one reason; I'd heard Tracy Scoggins was in it. Sadly, she only appears for a few seconds, in the only role that isn't detestible. The plot is simplistic to the point of non-existance. The characters are miles beyond idiotic, to the point where you suspect the scriptwriters are. There isn't enough suspense or finesse to fill a teaspoon. The only appeal Busey's character holds in his brief appearance is to those who find the extremes of gross amusing--in short, adolescent mentality that laughs at anything disgusting and cruel that Hollywood's been shovelling their way for the past few years. Makes some of the bad B-movies of the 50's look positively sophisticated and artsy. If it was meant to be a vague Blair Witch rip-off, it has more in common with the story of Hansel and Gretel (except that was scarier). I wish they allowed ""zero"" stars in the Amazon.com ratings..."
5,nice,"hello-this mouse is super,it has one little problem ,the sides need to have a none slip finish other than that i defintly, would buy another"
3,Players Choice,"I purchased to use in Gaming,can't really see the difference ,but do have a problem with the mouse pointer getting stuck on the window.I have to move it around and sometimes have to jolt it to make it work. Sorry to say"
5,Awesome !,"This mouse is freekin awesome! I'm new to PC gaming so I really had no idea a mouse can make such a diffrence. Going from my stock mouse playing Fear 2 and Crysis this is a dream! I normally use a claw grip , but thats because I really had no choice. The reason i purchased this mouse was the design. I have a small hand so this fits perfectly with flat grip. Its easy to set up and the on they fly DPI is huge for FPS. Do your self a favor and order this mouse! It's a work of art !"
4,Death Adder mouse,"I'm a pretty big FPS gamer and this mouse was recommended to me by a fellow gamer. It's very different from a regular ball mouse - if you are switching, be prepared for some frustration for at least a few weeks. This mouse has a lot of adjustable settings. Almost TOO many. The feet on it need to be a bit higher to use with a standard mouse pad. I've resorted to just using the desktop surface to get the proper 180 turning radius needed for an FPS game. The Logitech G9 might have been a better option."
3,"Decent mouse, but responding correctly anymore.","Bought two of this mouse almost a year ago for my wife and I. Wife who uses her mouse far more heavily for gaming and general use, has noticed the pointer is not responding or moving correctly when clicking the left button. Either doesn't respond to the click at all, or responds slowly and sticks, most noticeable when trying to highlight text and suddenly a whole paragraph gets highlighted and deleted. Been a nice mouse to have prior to this, but looking at its short lifespan, not worth the expense."
2,If your used to a G5 or any Logitech might not be good!,Ok so this mouse is a tough one. I am saying right not it is being returned but not due to it not working or being horrible. It is just not my style. It is a very flat and long mouse so if you are used to Logitech mouse this may not be the one for you. After about an hour of gaming my hand began to cramp. Never happened with my G5 that this replaced. Also i find myself when trying to move the mouse accidentaly clicking buttons and being a gamer this is not a good thing. I just got my G9 today and it is so much better. So if your used to a Logitech and looking for an upgrade go with the new G9.
5,DeathAdder Mouse,Very pleased with product and it's programmable capabilities. I now use it for quick exchange of weapons during online games.
4,Razer DeathAdder,"I really like this mouse, the only problem I see with it is the instructions are somewhat vague, they don't really explain how to use all the features."
1,"Best of feel, worst of performance","Razer, I am done with your products.This mouse like all their other products have been the best looking and best feeling input equipment I have ever owned. However the reliability of this equipment is horrible. Over the past year alone two of their keyboards and two of their mice have developed hardware flaws preventing their proper function. In the case of this mouse the mouse started to list in an upward direction whenever I would stop motion.Unacceptable performance, even worse customer support. Love the look and feel but for this price the thing needs to actually work."
3,Razer Death Adder Mouse,"The shape/feel of this mouse is very comfortable. Non-slip material covering the L/R click buttons. Nonslip lighted scrollwheel button. And it's really easy to use and program the side buttons. The software with the mouse was really good, easy to customize. I like it all except the part where the cord comes out. Though I don't rest my fingers there, I'm used to a logitech setup where it slopes down to the base of the mouse at the top of the L/R buttons. This mouse is has an abrupt edge there, not sharp, but difficult to get used to if you have used the other."
4,great mouse...,except for the plastic sides gets a lil annoying when my hands sweat and then theres residue. shoulda made the whole mouse outa the same material as the top.
5,A Web Designer Review,"I'm not a gamer, but I do live on my computer because I'm a website designer. I wanted a mouse that was perfect, and I have to say this mouse is the closest thing to it. The feel is absolutely perfect, very balanced and great texture. The click sound is perfect, the scroll wheel has perfect slight click feel with no sound. The mouse is light, but not to light, and is very easy to control. I have vista, and the default settings for the mouse worked great for me so I didn't bother installing the software. I also love the pulsing light haha. The side buttons are great too, perfect size unlike many other mice. All in all, it's practically a perfect mouse."
5,my favorite mouse,"I bought this mouse over 2 years ago, and it is still working like the day i bought it. I use it with a mac book pro, and even though it says you cannot program the buttons, you can and it is very easy, I have the side buttons set for expose and dashboard. This mouse feels like it belongs in your hand, its not tiny so even after using for hours your hand still is very comfortable"
1,Product Quality Issues and Support.,The mouse worked for a while then started to malfunction. Dealing with Razer support was a nightmare. Trust me when I say they do not back their products. They will do everything in their power not to replace defective product. Many complaints on product quality..not worth the money and hassle. Just to give you an example they told me that online purchases are NOT covered under warranty.
1,Not as good as it looks,"Great looking mose and feels great in hand. Downside is mouse failed after a month and software does not like to coincide with Microsft Outlook and iTunes. I had to reload support software several times during short life of the mouse.I bought the mouse at Amazzon and they do not accept returns after 30 days. Razer seems to also not accept returns.Razer customer support is abismal. They do not seem to want to accept a return of a dead mouse. After a week of hassleing, they still have not agreed to replace but have given me a form to fill out so they can consider what is the correct action. After 2 weeks I still have no idea if they will replace the mouse or if I just have to accept 45 days of life for $47."
5,beautiful upper register sound,"I was a bit concerned ordering this product at firt since It had sort of mixed reviews. Well I am very glad I was guided by the good ones. This alto recorder not only has a beautiful sound: perfect pitch for baroque music, but it is a very handsome instrument as well. It comes on a very pretty case, packed very nicely. I have been playing the recorder for a while and I thought it was time to upgrade to a wood one. I was tempted by the price and the fact it is made of rosewood. I am very very happy indeed. You will not regret it either. Just keep in mind as with any other wood recorder. You shouldn't play at firt for too long, not more than 10 minutes and then after not more than an hour a day if you wish to have a good instrument for years to come. It requires a bit more care than a plastic recorder (I have a yamaha 300 series) but it is definately worth having it."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I notice there are reviews in here for the Soprano. It should be for the Alto.This Alto recorder was a terrible waste of money for me.It is a nice looking instrument, and that's about it. It only plays o.k. in the first octave, and the sound was pretty nice, what with it being made of rosewood. Then going to the second ocatve, it was completely off. I figured, give it another try the next day, as recorders have to be broken in, and I was thinking maybe the wood was wet. I was really hoping it would sound better, but somehow knew that I got gypped.So, if you don't want to waste your money, don't buy this product. It will only be nice to look at and not good for much else. Maybe firewood.It also plays a 1/2 octave lower, so would be o.k. for playing for yourself, but if you are playing with other people, not so good. It would sound ""off"".I should have sent it back. Too late now."
3,Not pure Papaya Juice,I bought this at Whole Foods without carefully reading the deceptive label. It is 100% juice but not 100% Papaya juice. It is 100% juice: Papaya AND Apple.100% pure Papaya juice is recommended for people with health problems that produce too much phlegm. This isn't it.
1,A Dictionary of the Otchipwe Language,I am not happy with this publication. I wanted to send it back but could not find the shipping document. Some of it is illegible as it is just photo copied from an original. Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to give a review.
2,Poor Sequel.,"Unfortunantly, this third film in the Stepfather series dosn't feature Terry O'Quinn, the great actor who did a great job portraying the psychopath who marries and kills widows. However, this film just dosn't stand up in comparison to the other two films. Only watch if it's a slow Saturday night and there is nothing else to watch."
3,Horrible Video Quality - Craze DVD,"While the movie is decent for a 3rd sequel, the video quality on the new Craze DVD is horrendous. It looks like a bad VHS source; very fuzzy with washed out colors. Stick with the German DVD with the red and black cover, it has comparatively vastly superior video quality (although still somewhat poor). See link here: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Stepfather-3-Fathers-Day-uncut/dp/B0038K676U/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1334877736&sr=8-1"
2,For video quality alone,"Love the movie, my VHS copy looked better, horrible copy on DVD! The movie itself was a worthy sequel, not as good as the first two"
5,Lavish Loren Tribute!,"This terrific set of ""Sophia Siren Songs"" is a unique tribute to her, and a surprising cornucopia of offerings. The music is a mixed bag, but none of the selections are without interest, and some are quite extraordinary - as sonically sound as anything Marilyn Monroe or Bardot ever recorded, if you're into sexpot pop. This is an expensive set, but it's well worth the price for the sumptuous hardcover book accompanying the 2 CDs. There are over 300 pages of photos and color poster art from all her films. Also included is a DVD with varying quality, mostly European, trailers from all her films - a very nice addition. What you get is a fine quality collector's item - a wonderful souvenir for Sophia fans. For me, she's the screen's supreme sexpot - and one of it's finest actors, too!"
5,Superior,"My favorite Animotion album out there. There isn't one poor song on the whole CD. Each adds their own individual flavor to the mix, even the songs that didn't top the charts. Ironically, the songs that didn't top the charts (only a few did: Strange Behavior, Anxiety, I Want You, I Engineer) tend to be better and much more rock-heavy. Overall, Strange Behavior is an excellent album for anyone that appreciates New Wave and 80s rock/pop bands."
4,Just to counteract the clown...,"... ""Perfection"" almost certainly covers the point at which Cell finally absorbs #18 and becomes Perfect Cell. He's allowed to do so by Vegita, who wants a challenge. He gets his wish. In spades. Perfect Cell completely outclasses him.After I get the DVD in my hands, I'll do a real review. In the meantime, ignore the other ""review"" which was just typed in by some anti-fan who thought he or she was funny."
4,The 4th Super Saiyan,"Vegeta has given Cell the go ahead to absorb Android 18, But Trunks steps in the way. Using the Solar Flare he becomes Perfect. Meanwhile in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, Gohan gets angry at Goku for not training him hard enough. He has flashbacks of when he let his friends down and transforms. Back in the real world Perfect Cell demenstrats a small part of his power."
2,Not What I Expected,The barometer I received was defective - one of the needles had come off its' spindle and was loose between the dial and the glass. The barometer was made in China and not what I expected from Weems & Plath. I returned it for a full refund.
2,Weems & Plath Barometer,"A nice looking decoration to hang on the wall, but it never agrees with the local barometric readings. I set it to read the same as the local reading, but it never reads the same again. After setting it multiple times I just gave up and use it as a rather expensive thermometer."
4,A sublime chronicle of human suffering,"Not only have I read this novel (twice) I use it in a way to ensure that I no longer take life, in all its aspects good and bad for granted. The reviewer from NJ (top of this list) has missed the point entirely, this is not a book of military strategy, and ""the German perspective"" is well documented elsewhere. How often are we allowed entrance into the inner workings of the Russian experience. Salisbury respected the limitless sacrifice of the Russian people so much that he felt obligated to share it with the world, in a time when so many lived in feer for being sympathetic of the Soviets."
4,900 Days...it takes about that long to read it ;),"It's a long book, but worth reading. Most books about the Eastern Front are written from a German perspective, so it was refreshing to see the Russian side of the story (and what a side!). The last thing I would want to be would be a Soviet officer during that time! If the Nazis didn't shoot you, the Communists would!Overall a good book. It got dull at a few points, but the author keeps it interesting by blending stories and anecdotes told by people who were there. Could have used some maps, too."
2,It's not what I expected,I didn't really expect it. It's a very tough book only suitable for historians. It's not the narrative and entertainingly book that I expected.
2,Poor!,"The review that stated that Salisbury writes about 'The first 90 Days' is correct!Leningrad was a siege and a stage for several battles arround its outskirts and... no map! No geography!What the author does most is to describe the hardships of his ""peers"": ""poets"", ""writers"", ""artists"", ""playwrights"" and ""intelligentsia"" like they were la créme de la créme -(and this says a bit about the author).The Germans are barely mentioned (not that I am a fan!).""Guns"" and ""cannons"" are they the same?""tommy guns"" instead of submachineguns...The most infamous close air support pilot of all time, Hans-Ulrich Rudel, the one that hit the ""Marat"" is not mentioned, but insignificant ""intelectual"" bums with silly hats do.Bad book by a Pulitzer prize winner. I do not recommend this book to any military historian.It does have plenty grim ""stuff"", much to the delight of the author's adored ""intelligentsia""."
3,Where is the German perspective?,This book totally misses the point by almost completely ignoring the perspective of the German soldier in this tragic historical event. If given a choice I would have spent my money on one of a hundred other very interesting books on the subject of WWII.
1,Journalists are not historians,"Salisbury's semantics say it all: he refers to the Russian Army, and the Nazi Army. But either both are political, or both are not. German Army and Russian Army, or Nazi Army and Communist Army. This is one of many signals revealing his strange affection for a barbaric regime and his amateurish mishandling of the subject. I have kept this book only as a lesson in how not to write, or research, history.Journalists are not historians. I wonder if Solzhenitsyn ever read Salisbury - or vice versa - and what he thought. For a history of the struggle for Leningrad, read a historian."
1,The book is a classic; this edition IS NOT,"Read this book by all means, but don't buy this edition. The print quality is awful...the text, photos and maps are blurry."
4,An important book,"This book reviews an important segment of the history of WWII. But for the stubborn resistance by the Russians the way might well have turned out differently. This book is sad and shocking in its description of the siege of St Petersburg by the Nazi troops.My only problem is the author's tendency to include the names of too many Russians that at this point mean little to me. The book needs an editor to trim some of the book's wordiness. Still, it is most interesting."
3,So-So Recording,"While the chance to own this music is nice, there are places where it seems that this was taken from a film print. During the dance number ""You Are My Lucky Star,"" for example, you hear the dance routine done tap dance style. Not the greatest listening experience, in my opinion.The reproduction is clear, altough very flat sounding. Not a bad pair of soundtracks to have on one disc, but kind of sad that better source materials weren't found for this release."
4,"Who's stronger, Trucks or Goten?","Before the adult main event, there's the Jr. event and with Goten and Trucks entering, guess who going to the finals. Very funny when Goten and Trunks are individually competeing against other 'normal' kids. Without giving away who wins the Jr. event, its great to see Mr. Satan taking on the winner and get punched by one of the Jr. Sayians. One of the best tapes before the start of the Boo Series. 4 stars because its dubbed."
5,World Tournament,"This is the funniest movie ever! Trunks and Goten fight as super little, but super strong super saiyans. In the end of Gotens and Trunks fight, Goten cries because he losses. To make Goten happy,Tunks says that Goten can have any three of his toys. Then Goten is happy."
4,(...),This VHS was good. It was about the Junior Division of the World Fighting Tournament. If you like this video . Buy more Dragon Ball Z Tapes. This is mostly about the fight between Chibi Trunks and Goten.When the match ends Chibi Trunks wins.
4,a unique interpretation on Bach,"This guy is bold enough to apply Baroque bowing and fingering on a modern violin in an attempt to bring out Bach/Baroque spirit. He plays too fast for most pieces, like ""perpetual motion"", thus not so enjoyable. (No wonder it disappointed some.) If you really want Baroque experience, try Rachel Podger on a real baroque violin with baroque bowing. For more pleasant modern (non-baroque) interpretation, try Hahn. For more common and modern presentation, you may want to stick with Milstein. But this disc has some value, and the recording effect is quite good. I have not heard his other recording, but given he can do both kinds of bowing, he must be good, and his unique playing deserves credit."
1,EVERYTHING STICKS TO THESE PANS!!!!,I bought these pots and pans and everything sticks to them and clean up is FAR from a breeze! I use PAM before I start cooking and that even sticks to them! I am VERY upset that I spent that kind of money on a poor set of pots and pans! Buyer BEWARE!!
3,Return.... Sure Ok,"Danger Danger was never a good album band and that's not saying they didn't have some good songs. They had a couple of tracks from their debut which were great songs of the genre. This album is in no way connected to the Danger Danger of old. This is a rocking new band with Canada's Paul Laine on vocals. With him comes a new sound and heavier, rawer sound. His vocals are tougher than Ted's which makes the band sound tougher and that's what was always the problem. Cherry, Cherry is by far the best track the band has ever recorded. But once you get to that track you will have heard 4 or 5 others that are almost as good. It's nice that Ted has come back to the band but honestly if this came out between 1987 & 1990 it would have been a massive success and Skid Row would have had some competition."
1,"Awful, Awful, Awful",This is what happens when a junior high school film project gets a national release. Everything about this movie SUCKED. I suffered through 20 minutes of it trying to give it a chance...the only thing I got was a void of 20 minutes in my life that I will never get back. Learn from my mistake: DONT DO IT. Save yourself. This belongs in the category of double A (AA...all puns fully intended!) Awful and Amateur.
5,Great little nursery set,"My daughter loves this bag. My 2yr. old straps the velcro diaper bag onto her doll stroller. Her favorite part of the set is the diaper and the baby powder that makes a rattling noise when shaken. Daily, she packs everything into the bag and then takes it out-examining the pieces each time. Would definitly recommend."
2,Too small for the price,"I didn't care for this set. The bag is flimsy and the bottle and changing pad are all thin material and very far from the real thing. My daughter has only used the powder shaker of this set. For the money, I would buy some other brand."
3,Great product - horrible packaging,"my title says it all. This is an excellent product, BUT the container/dispenser is HORRIBLE! it is big and clunky and takes up way too much room. it is also extremely difficult to open and close and, if not closed properly, the cloths dry up. I will not buy this product again until they improve the container."
2,What can I say? It stinks!!,"I was incredibly happy to find and ""earth friendly"" alternative to the convenient Lysol and Clorox wipes that I often use. And I have tried other products from this line and really like them. Unfortunately, this product didn't have me singing its praises. In fact, it left me gagging. The product has a terrible smell that lingers on...and on...after you use it. Plus, as the previous reviewer mentioned, the container is not well designed and I have had trouble getting the towels out every time. I just bought these and don't know what I am going to do with the five I haven't opened! My biggest recommendation is to buy them at a local store first to try them before buying in bulk here."
5,One review... this CLASSIC album has just one review,"This is great classic rock, bluesy, and totally rocks... we've all heard and loved 'All right now' and i quite simply advise you get this... it's just a great... classic rock album... that's the only way of putting it... I'm listening to it now... although the price here is a bit steep, you should be able to get this for a lotless from your local store..."
2,Great for one song.,I purchased this CD for one favorite song and that's what I received. The rest of the songs on this CD really are terrible. I believe this group make their bucks on one piece.
4,enjoyed,it was as good as I expected. I enjoy Asimov stories and General Sci Fi books. I'll be back for more.
4,"Really good story, exciting and suspenseful.","Again Asimov enthralls us with another exciting and suspenful story with good characters and fast action. Keeps you in suspense through most of the book with great writing and short descriptions. It's a pleasure to be able to read these ageless accounts in their original prints, it's like stepping into a time machine."
1,Insanely Expensive,"I'm with SA (Alabama)... I'd like the kindle edition of this classic, but there's NO WAY I'm paying that much for an e-book this old. What are they thinking??? I'm buying the paperback used."
3,"Asimov OK, but book construction is of poor quality","Asimov is Asimov, however this review is about the quality of the book - basically it's poorly made. The paper has the quality of school tablet paper and is very flimsy and easy to tear. The cover has barely thicker paper than the contents, plus the printing is very light and is only readable in bright light. This book is a one or two time reading copy and won't last but a few years even on the shelf. Amazon has let the quality of their books at this price point go down."
1,RIDICULOUS PRICE!!!!,"WTF! This book is 58 years old! The Author, who is a master, has been dead for 18 years. The book cost about $2.50 to make and they are selling it for $9.99. How come Macmillan/Tor don't get it? Even Spectra understands because they sell the Foundation books for $5.99. This is pure price gouging by the publishers in my opinion."
2,A bit too boring.,"I have always enjoyed Isaac Asimov's nonfiction books but this one is just too dry and too technical. While he usually excels at explaining difficult scientific concepts to the laymen, he lost this layman a lot. I did enjoy the historical parts of the book and the last chapter on longevity was worth reading the entire book to get to. It was its one shining moment."
2,A rare non-fiction book from a sci-fi Grand Master.,This book is an exploration of a number of scientific related information that Asimov knows so well. It is a bit dry and not like his novels.More of a textbook than anything else.
2,Not Mac friendly,"Tried and tried and tried uploading from a Mac. While I had no problem uploading, none of the photos appeared on the frame. Called tech support (which, incidentally, is in the Philippines) and, despite the fact that the manual clearly mentions Mac support, was told that Mac is not supported. He referred me to a FAQ, which does not mention the issue at all (their on-line support says to call Customer Support!) I asked to speak to a supervisor who said that it can be used with a Mac and she talked me through it (the same way I had done it) but still no photos showed. Fortunately (?) I have a PC and, using the Photo Manager software (PC only) I had no problem. So, if you only have a Mac, forget it."
4,One of the best digital frames,I bought this after reviewing most of the alternatives. The reputation of Phillips products and the timer shutoff were the main reasons.It is easy to load and program and the picture quality is outstanding.
3,The display is great,"Getting it to display the pictures is a PITA.Usability is, at best, mediocre. Examples: It takes it a LONG time to figure out how to display thumbnails; it just plain refuses to display some images. The frequency of change in the slide show is variable.The UI is awful."
5,very easy,My husband is a real tech nut and he loved this. The instructions were helpful and easy to follow. He was able to loadthe pics he wanted and even categorize them into seperate showings.There was no growling...only smiles.
4,Zambezi water comin' down,"I heard Tony Bird in person about 25 years ago and bought his record ""Tony Bird of Paradise"" right after the show. I lllloved it and played it over and over again; it transported me into a state of ecstasy. I could imagine the birds, animals, vegetation, and natives of Africa around me and I could vicariously enjoy their enthusiasm for life while listening. His songs 'Bird of Paradise' and 'She loves someone' were my favorites. I gave this album only 4 stars because those two songs aren't on it. Still I like 'Mango time' and 'Zambezi Zimbabwe'. This guy has a funny nasal voice, but his singing seems to capture some of the native color of southern Africa."
2,Over-produced and trite; occasional flashes of brilliance,"I'd love to hear an album of new songs of just Tony Bird and his guitar and voice, sans all the political palaver about South Africa (the man lives in Manhattan, gimme a break)! But talented he is. I hope he'll one day be well enough to work again."
2,Confusing directions,This product is attractive and accurately described. But the directions on using the childproofing features and even how to properly assemble the product for using the cords are inadequate. We haven't gotten it to operate. Disappointing.
1,Disappointed - Don't waste your money.,It does not handle the full size tubes that I suspect most folks use. The tube they are showing is a mid size or small size tube. There has to be something better out there for folks that have limited hand function.
4,Good case,"I got this because I thought it had padding to protect the camera from occasional bumps. It did not have padding in it but I would recommend the case it is soft, good looking and useful. A friend of mind late got one for her camera and she is also please with it."
3,meh. It's okay. It is what it is.,"The product came on time and looks exactly like the picture.I can't imagine it actually costs that much to ship this case. Basically if you think you're getting some amazing deal on a camera case, keep looking. The shipping cost is outrageous. BUT, I bought it because I needed something to cover the screen on my camera, so it is functioning in the way I needed it too. And I didn't have to go to the store, so that is a bonus. And why is this thing deluxe?? What so deluxe about it? It has a strap hole and a pocket--the pocket is not big enough for the USB cord nor for extra batteries. Yeah, pretty deluxe."
3,Too Small for the Canon Powershot A630,"This case showed up as a related product when we were purchasing our A630 (which we love), but we have found the case to be just too small for the camera, with no room for anything but the camera itself (no room for memory cards, batteries, or whatever). We've gone a purchased a somewhat larger case from a local retailer and it's worked much better."
5,great case!,Great case for a great camera. Pocket in front holds two AA batteris for emergency. Unreservedly recommend. mb
2,Do not buy for A630,"It is very small and barely fits over my A630, there is no room for anything else in it and it feels like the camera will fall out at any second.If you have a smaller camera though, I would buy it."
4,Good low storage case.,"This is a good overall case for daily use, but it is not large enough to store multiple accessories. It has a small pocket for an extra SD card in the back and the front can snuggly fit an extra set of AA batteries. Stitching and fabric look and feel high quality and durable."
1,wrong bag,"you gave the wrong bag to me,it donot fit in the camera.i am very disappointed.Please do not repeat this with any other customer atleast.thanks"
5,"Sleek, Sharp & Priced Right!","This case is perfect for protecting your camera on-the-go. If you are looking for a good fit for your Canon A560 to carry in your purse with you, this is the right one for you. There is an opening in the case for the hand strap to fit through, so open your purse, grab your strap & away you go to get that perfect picture!If you need room for ANYTHING else but the camera, then DON""T get this case! There won't even be a spot for another SD disc. But like I said, it will protect your camera from being scratched up in your purse and at your fingertips as well.Happy shooting:)"
4,fits perfectly,i use my camera for work so i carry it in my purse back and forth everday. fits nicely in case although a little more room in extra pocket would be great for the batteries. overall very happy.
5,Great little case,This case is way better than the reviewers say. The camera fits easily in and out of it and is good protection from bumps and bangs in your bag. Excellent value.
3,Sng Fit Need Bigger Accessory Compartment,Nicely made but it would be nice to have more room for spare battery and CF card.
3,Too small for the A640,"I bought this case for my Canon Powershot A640 because it was advertised as a case compatible for this camera. However, the camera is a little too long so the top flap of the case just barely touches the other side of the case with the velcro. It gets the job done, but if you have the A640, I would suggest looking for another case that's a better fit."
3,One Size Fits All Seldom Does,"This case is advertised as being designed for the Canon A630 camera (among several others). Although I can get my camera into it and can just barely get the flap closed on the velcro fastener, it is just a bit too tight. To carry a spare SD card in the pocket designed for that purpose would make the fit impossible."
2,Tight Fit,"If you have a Canon A630 as I do, it not a desirable case. It like a woman who like to wear tight blue jeans. You can just barely button it up. Forget about carrying extra batteries or extra SD memory cards."
2,Small for A630,it is small for a 630 camera. and it does nt have a belt for the neck. it is hard to carry unless you carry at your belt
2,Not For Me,"This is a dissapointment for me the Case is too small for the camera it is intended for, once the camera is forced in there is no room for anything else and I mean NO room"
3,Not that happy with this camera case for the Canon A630,"This case is not as big as I would have liked for my canon A630, but now that I have it, I'll hang onto it. I would not buy it again though"
4,A good purchase,A good complement to my Canon A560. Fits well. Only downside is that the strap hole on the camera case is located in the middle. The strap of the camera is located at the top portion. Plus the front pouch for the memory card container seems to big. It always falls out. Minor inconveniences really. Good protection for the camera.
2,Not a perfect fit,The case is nice but will only fit the camera. I have a Canon A630 and the camera fits nicely in the case but can't fit any extra's. Like batteries.
3,Simple and practical,"The case is made of relatively goods material, is small practical with a small pocket inside."
4,Nice case for price,"I recently purchased the case for my new Canon Powershot A540, and the camera fits perfectly into the case. It has a nice compact, snug fit and isn't too bulky looking. I like the fact that it has the extra pockets, even though I wish they were bigger; but with the sleekness and compact design it would have looked too big with pockets that were any bigger. I also kind of wish the closure was more secure and protected the part of the camera that is exposed from dust. But this case was the best deal for such a low price. The company that shipped it to me was excellent and timely. It came before the estimated delivery date and the price couldn't be beat."
2,This camera case is too small.,"The camera case is just large enough to hold the camera. But you will probably want room for your SD card, spare batteries, the data transfer cord, and possibly other things. This case will pretty much only hold the camera. I suggest taking your new camera to a few retailers and inspecting the goods in person. You may also find the prices more to your liking than buying Canon-branded accessories."
2,Canon PSC-65 Deluxe Soft Case,"There is very little of 'Deluxe' about this case. It is somewhat ordinary and cheap-looking, and functionally poor. It is rather small for the size of the camera it is supposed to house. Recommendation: look for something else and buy this only if no other options are available. But it is cheap, that's true."
1,very small,I have the camera canon A630 and really it does not fit. I feel defrauded for amazon because he recommends her for this model of camera.
3,Canon PSC-65 for an A570IS,"The case is well made, and fits nicely, but does NOT have a shoulder strap. Once I received the case, I found it cumbersome to have it hanging from my wrist."
4,"Nice, but too small.","I bought this case because I bought an A630 Canon from Amazon because it was listed as made for this camera, among others. The camera fits really tight and it has a pocket for batteries, sdcard, etc., but they all better be paper thing because there's really no room, well maybe one sd card, but that's it."
2,needs a strap!,"Wish I'd read the reviews before I added this to my cart. Without a strap, it's just another thing to hold, so I'm using my older generic case which I can sling over my shoulder. The belt loop doesn't help if I'm wearing a dress!Shipping it back would cost almost as much as the case itself, so I'll just let it sit here on the junk pile. Blech."
1,Doesn't fit the A630!!!,"This case is way too small for the A630. You can barely get the velcro clasp to close and the hole for the wrist strap is in the wrong place. I have another Canon camera, a 610 I think, and it fits fine, but this is the wrong case for the 630."
1,Canon PSC-65 Deluxe Soft case,"We bought this camera case as part of a package for our camera (Canon PowerShot A540.) We were very disappointed in the quality. It is rather cheap in appearance, and has poor utility in that when you open the case to take the camera out, whatever is in the accessory pocket (spare batteries, memory cards) is not secured and falls out. (We ended up going to Best Buy and purchased a Lowepro case that has a zippered compartment for the camera, a separate pocket with velcro flap for accessories and a smaller zippered pocket on the flap for memory cards, money, etc. Cost of the Lowepro was about $11.00.)We don't recommend that you include the Canon PSC-65 Deluxe Softcase in your camera purchase. It's a waste of your money."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed as I read this to be a water proof camera bag. The sides of this bag do not cover the camera nevertheless the camera would not be protected from water, sand or anything else."
3,good value for money,"for the cost, it delivers value.. if u looking for a more spacious pouch then mebe u vud like to look at biger options.. but for caryin ur camera,spare cells it works"
1,No use as Camera was dead out of box,The camera was Dead out of Box Canon A 640.So returned the case.
2,DOES NOT FIT A630,"This case does not fit the A630. I'm sure it's great (that's why I gave it two stars), but only when you buy it for a smaller camera. I had heartache when I ordered it, because it simply didn't fit! I hope no one makes the same mistake I did."
4,OK for the price,Fits my Powershot A560 perfectly. Only reason it gets 4 stars is because the net pouch on the side is useless. Anything you put in it (read extra batteries) will fall out unless the case is kept perfectly level.
3,Sturdy compact case,"Great case if you only need to carry your camera. With an A540, basically only the camera will fit. The case itself is very sturdy and keeps the camera snugly inside and protected."
2,Case is too small for the A630,"I bought an A630 camera and this case to go with it but when I got the items it turns out the camera barely fits in the case. You have to stretch the material to secure the velcro. They need to make it a little bit bigger for that model. Other than that, I got what I paid for..."
4,Works well,"This case works well for the cameras specified. It doesn't have any bells or whistles, it's just a holder to keep the camera from getting scratched."
3,Strapless!,"I bought this case for the Canon powershot A570IS. The camera fits nicely in the case. The only thing is, i hadn't realised that it has no strap. The camera has to be handheld using the camera's strap, or kept in a bag although it does have a belt strap - not too practical for girls! I may have to look for another camera case with strap."
4,Canon camera case review,The case is made of high quality material and fits my Canon powershot A700 perfectly. I would have given it 5 stars if the case had a seperate compartment for carrying an extra set of batteries. There is just enough room to carry the camera and an extra memory chip. No extra batteries.
1,camera case,This is wasted money to buy. It is a very tight fit and no extra room for batteries or SD cards. Why bother? Go to Walmart and you can buy something much better and cheaper!
1,Dissappointed,The case is too small for the camera it was purchased for. It would probably work great for a smaller more compact camera.
2,Wrong for the A630!,"I must agree with Mary and the others. This is not a good fit for the A630. It barely allows the velcro to meet, and forget carrying extra batteries or even a memory card. Amazon should edit the models this case is suited for. I'll use it until I can find a better one locally."
4,Didn't think I needed a case.,"With my previous point and shoot cameras the case wound up in a drawer and the camera in a pocket. This case is different, because it is less bulky and allows for quick access to the camera. The Camera strap holds the case on the wrist while the camera is being used. It even holds an extra set of AA batteries."
2,Too small,Bought this for a Canon A620. Too small for this camera. Can't fit camera much less anything else.
2,Very small to fit anything,You can just fit the camera. Its very hard to fit even 2 batteries with it.
3,Canon Camera Case,"I have the Canon A700...it fits the camera perfectly, it does have a belt strap but does not have a shoulder strap or a place to attach a shoulder strap which I prefer."
3,Use of case for A630 camera,The case is compact and serves me well to carry the camera on my belt. The flap is a little short for use with the A630 camera as it barely latches on to the velcro.
4,Good Case For Wearing On Your Belt,"I bought this case for my son to go with his Canon A710 IS. It is well made of heavy nylon and mesh and a soft fleece lining and looks great in shades of blue/grey. It is very compact, with a belt loop on the back, a very tiny pocket inside to hold an extra memory card and a small pocket on the outside front that really won't hold much. It's designed to allow you to have your camera instantly at hand by wearing it on your belt but will not replace a larger bag for your camera necessities and accessories. Your camera fits snugly and securely but there is no room for anything else."
2,Too small!,The case is too small for my A630 and it doesn't look like the one shown in the picture. The lid can barely be closed and no room for anything else. I am very disappointed at this product.
4,Does the job,"This is a nice case that does the job. It holds the camera snugly and securely and has a pocket inside for an extra memory card. There is little room for more than your camera, which helps it to be more on the compact side."
1,Does not fit A640,"This case was advertised as a case for A640, but it will not let you to close a flap with camera in. It may fit other models but it definitely will NOT fit A640."
1,Doesn't fit A640,"This product lists the A640 as one it works with. It doesn't. Not even a tight fit. Just flat out doesn't fit.But, since it costs more to return it than throw it away, I'm stuck with it now."
3,Canon PSC-65 Deluxe Soft Case,The built-in belt loop makes it an easy and safe way to transport and protect the camera.I purchased this for a Canon A620 camera and it fits well and securely.
4,Keep Them Comming,"Finally, what I've been waiting for, a series that accessibly captures the thoughts of the masters in more than ""90 Minutes"". This book figures prominently next to Milan Rai's _Noam Chomsky_ and other well written secondary sources designed specifically to bring great thinkers to a broader audience. If you're intimidated by unelucidated technical language or insulted by having to buy a book titled ""For Morons"", then this and its series companions are the books you're looking for. I sincerely hope to see more additions in the future, especially branching into coverage of great thinkers of the past. Thank you Ruth Abbey and thank you series editor John Shand."
5,Representin' Real,"Heavy hittin' s--t from Houston, Texas......features some production from Pimp C. Very nice record, any fan of the good ol' early-mid 90's Southern scene will love this. This cut's too Trill. Oh yeah...kinda hard to find this one, but it's available on a few websites, type it into a search"
3,"visually stunning, would be great if only....",When I recieved this book I was very excited. Looking through it the photography and presentation of the desserts is magnificent. Unfortunatly after numerous attempts on atleast 3 recipes I have decided to put this book on my coffee table and not my cookbook shelf. I found the recipes to lack clarity and some just don't turn out right even with following the directions to the letter. I have used it only as picture reference since the last fiasco. A beautiful book but a sad dissapointment as a cookbook.
4,"excellent ideas and photos, but not for the practical chef","charlie trotter creates some of the finest courses i've ever seen. the only problem with this is, nothing contained within this series of books is even remotely practical or feasible from the home kitchen. the ingredients he uses are sometimes impossible to find (even when ordering through a professional kitchen), and the equiptment required for them aren't usually owned by the common cook. so, if you're serious about trying to create an award winning entree or desert, and have the time, patience, equiptment, and endless exotic produce, this book is perfect for you. the rest of us will just have to admire the pictures."
2,Useful only for photos & inspiration,"I can say that I am a reasonably competent home chef with an above-average knowledge of technique and most necessary equipment to get the job done. Having said that, I was impressed with the photos of nearly every featured recipe in this book and find the recipes to be admirably aggressive in their taste and texture contrasts. The recipes, however, are nearly all flawed in some significant manner in that following them verbatim will result in poor results. Even when this is not the case, I find these recipes to be ""out of whack"" from a taste perspective by any gastronome's standards and in need of serious tweaking. If you have good kitchen skills and seek to be inspired by the ideas in this book, then I would suggest it (USED!!) ... otherwise, there are much better cookbooks that will yield far superior results."
3,Great Photo Essay...,"But it ends there. Like the others before me, this book leaves a bit to be desired.The recipes require a pastry certification just to attempt. I have one and I still wouldn't try most of these in my spare time. They require great skill and exotic ingredients in most cases. Nobody will find this book useful for casual dessert needs.The photos, on the other hand are incredibly beautiful. This book *can* inspire. I do keep this book easily at hand for guests to drool over. I just prepare something uch more simplistic, yet delicious in it's own right.If you like awe insipiring dessert pictures, this is your book. If you want awe insipiring desserts you can actually prepare, you are better served with something like ""The Williams-Sonoma Collection: Dessert"""
2,Great photos--flawed recipes,"My husband is a chef, I cook and bake often, and was even a personal chef. We've tried two of these recipes so far and neither have worked! One of them was completely off in the dough and couldn't possibly have worked and the other we are still working on. It's for a portion of a recipe that has toffee. We have resorted to finding another toffee recipe online and will try to make that and incorporate it in the recipe. It is very disappointing! I've tried this portion 3 times now with no luck. Thats just not right. Buy this book only for the photos and try to make them by using other recipes that you know and trust or use a reputable site with user reviews. We've ate at Trotters and it was good, but we've both had better meals for less money."
2,"Excellent photos,but...","...Charlie Trotter's dessert is of limited to no use for a Continental/European Chef/Cook. Weights and measures are all in cups and ounces.Still maybe undestandable for a European Chef but impossible to work for instance a Russian Chef (These are the people who buy these books because they want to learn.They have little chance to travel yet,so have to rely on books to improve their skills) I have checked ,quickly only, through the recipes and gave up,there are also certain facts not right (Original Linzer cake you don't make with raspberries but with 'red currants'.Also recipes are using to many US specific names and terms,i.e. what is a Meyer lemon? And for the poor amateur cook?Well,look at the pictures and go have dinner where Trotter is cooking! Had I known before,I would not have purchased the book. Benedikt Morak, Executive Chef (from Austria,35 years i nthe business)"
5,Christine Folk and Novelty Lavin,Dr Demento introduced me to Christine Lavin through her novelty song Sensitive New Age Guys. I bought this cd after years of wondering what else she does. I dont know if Dr Demento plays the shopping cart song Shopping cart of love the play but if he doesnt he should. The first time I heard that I was on the floor laughing. Then theres The Kind of Love You Never Recover From which is my favorite of the serious ones. This is a good cd.
1,Falsely Advertised!,"Item is NOT from Honeywell, and NOT the right size. But it's too cheap to bother dealing with it so my best bet it to warn others..."
5,Classic Album,"I remember when Blue Angel was playing the clubs in NYC. The closest I got to seeing them live back then was a night they were doing a show and me and a friend had no money so we sat outside the club and listened to the show. I had the LP and played it to death.The album just flat out rocks. The band is great and Cyndi's vocals boom through the music. This was a great retro, rockabilly gem and I would strongly recommend it, even for people who are not fans of Cyndi Lauper."
5,love it,"I loved this Album as a cassette tape, and I am sure I would never have found it anywhere but on amazon!"
5,Cyndi Lauper's first album ever,"This album is great.It sounds powerful even after all these years. Cyndi's voice is AMAZING.""I'm gonna be strong"" and ""Everybody's got an angel"" are worth the whole album by themselves.It's rockabilly, so enjoyable.If you like Cyndi Lauper, you must have this."
5,And Still More Peter Blood!,"This is another collection of Sabatini's short stories featuring Peter Blood presented in serial order so the book can be read cover to cover or one story at a time. The plots center around Captain Blood's clever outwitting of his many opponents and incidents brought about by his fame in the Caribbean, including an imposter besmirching his reputation and a clever adversary who sees through one of the Captain's many alternate personas. Highly readable and very enjoyable."
2,If Only,Great novel if only I could get it delivered. I have ordered this and other Sabatini books from Amazon and have yet to ever receive one. The last one was perpetually backordered. For months and months I received messages asking if I still wanted the book. Then it was cancelled. Then mpnths latter I ordered another again and that was backordered as well.
2,Sexy and Provocative Psychological Thriller..... No point at All.,"This was sexy and provocative psychological thriller, but it also had no point in it what so ever. She was crazy and depressed and needed help. And who was the little girl at the end. And what was the cause and effect in this movie. Yes there's nudity, hers only, and sexual acts. You really don't hear anything but see the visiuals. I'm still trying to figure what was the point into making a movie like this and what happened in her past that we don't see at all.. And yes she did help others see what was missing in thier lifes. The movie itself just plain stupid, and trying to feel sorry for her isn't the answer either. But my favorite part was the end were her best friend punches the sh---out of her."
1,Worst movie ever made,There is no plot. No kind of ending. Never comes together. Title is the only good thing in this project. Acting is worse than just bad.
1,Foghorn Flounders,"I tried to get through this CD again the other day, but couldn't. Miss Dalys voice makes Carol Channing sound like Maria Callas. One to miss."
2,"Call Me Madam disappointing, but better than nothing.","For years I've wanted a CD of the wonderful Call Me Madam musical. And, I've wanted to view the movie again, but it apparently isn't on VCR or cable. In the Tyne Daly CD, Daly sounds like she had been carousing for three days and nights, did a quick once-over runthrough with the orchestra, and recorded. She sounds tired, more laid-back than Peggy Lee, and disinterested in the entire production--perhaps because it wasn't a real show in the conventional sense, with sets, props, and costumes.The other vocalists are also singing by rote, totally devoid of emotion. And finally, the orchestra is very thin, almost like a band from a junior college drama department production. Aarrgh! But, it's better than nothing at all."
2,"As a belter, she's just LOUD","A belter should have a brash, pingy and IN TUNE sound. Tyne Daly cannot sustain a pitch without a serious dip in intonation to save her life. She does okay as long as the line keeps moving, but G*d forbid she should have to hold a note. She ruined the ON THE TOWN recording, particularly ""Some other time"" for the very same reason."
3,"I miss Ethel, but I love Tyne","Its nice to read so many reviews here by Ethel Merman fans. Indeed, it is hard to listen to Ethel Merman singing Irving Berlin and not believe those two were perfectly matched. Merman had a voice made for beltin' it out to the balconies and Berlin gave her plenty of wonderful opportunities,Still, I hope I do not speak heresy to say that Ethel Merman lacked a certain subtlety. It is refreshing to hear some of these old Berlin standards given a slightly different spin. WhatTyne Daly lacks in volume and lung capacity, she makes up in wit and tenacity. She doesn't sing like Merman, but she is better with a gag line. Sometimes she makes Berlin seem more like Cole Porter.Like the new Bernadette Peters version of Annie Get Your Gun, this is a great addition to the Irving Berlin catalog. Enjoy!"
1,My stomach,I was only able to take these pills for less than a week. i notice that my nails did grow fast but the pain and discomfort in my stomach was overpowering. i was not able continue to take the pills.
5,super service,"These cards were a birthday gift for my 10-year-old son and true to their word, the cards arrived very quickly and in perfect condition. My son and his dad had a great time exploring the treasures-both old-timers and newer stars that were included in this pack. I would not hesitate to order from this company again."
3,"ok, not so great","Even though some of the tracks in this CD are good, I am not very pleased with this work of Yanni. This CD is really a far cry from Yanni's Live at Acropolis, If I could tell you, In My time. So, if you are experimenting Yanni, try to get another one...you have to try Yanni at his best, and this CD is not it. For the devoted fan, I think this will still muster a 4 star rating. so, in short, good addition to a Yanni collection if you are a devoted fan. else, try another one of Yanni and you will become a devotee!"
4,One of the greatest,"Yanni has to be one of the greatest artists that I have ever heard of. His music is so relaxing and soothing. After hearing him for the first time, I haven't stopped buying or listening to his music"
3,Not the best,"This recording was released from my understanding without the guiding hand of Yanni who usually had his hand in the selecting of the songs released on his albums. Because he wasn't involved as he usually is, this recording lacks the clarity that is often found in his musical layouts. If you are thinking of trying a Yanni album, I would not make this one your first choice."
4,A good compilation of Yanni's past compositions,"""Snowfall"" is a a good compilation of Yanni's past compositions. This album has some of Yanni's older music on it. I like Yanni alot and this album is good. I have always liked Yanni's style of compositions which uses piano and synthesizers. Yanni is a fantastic keyboardist and a very talented and gifted composer. This album has some really cool music on it. Won't dissapoint."
4,Makes me wish for winter!,"Yanni's music can be an awe-inspiring at times. I wished that I was listening to this compact disc collection of his music while it is cold and in the wintertime. The title, Snowfall, makes you wish for winter once again and snow. Yanni's music is great new age. Maybe it's better because there are no lyrics or vocals. It would spoil the sound of his music which can be heard endlessly without getting tired. It's not elevator music but good elevating music to soothe the soul after a hard day at work or at home. Each song makes you forget your troubles for just a little bit."
5,"Musicianship, diversity, wonderful singing and great tunes!","I had never heard of Kristina Olsen, and probably wouldn't have, if the music store I was browsing in one day hadn't been piping it over the p.a.. I stopped in my tracks to listen. All these years later, this remains one of my favorite CD's ... especially while riding in the car. The music takes me to good places in my mind every time. To this day, I still don't know much about Kristina Olsen, but I sure love this CD!"
5,Awesome Socks,I love how soft and fuzzy these socks are. Very comfortable and fun to wear. My grandkids love wearing them too.
3,Soft and warm to wear in place of slippers,These are nice to wear around the house during the winter months but are not great with shoes. They are very slippery so be careful on hardwood floors.
2,Sad that the color choices have been limited.,I loved the first paid and came back for more only to find two colors. :( What happened to the Champagne and Smoke Colors?
4,she dug it,"my girlfriend likes it warm, i like it cold. she as an abundance of super cozy fluffy warm clothing and these were the latest addition to the roster."
4,Socks,Given as a gift. Recipient likes it. Shipped on time. I found them to be a little less than what I expected.
5,ahhh warm and soft,i will never buy cotton socKs againthese feel so nicelove iti wish they came in anKlets!!
2,Not that warm and they fall off,"I got these because I have circulation problems in my feet. However, they're not that warm. I have wool socks that are much warmer. Plus, they don't have enough elastic and so they fall off in bed. I would not recommend these to anyone."
3,Fuzzy but kind of weird smell,"I gave these socks just 3 stars because they are nice and warm and fuzzy, but they have a really strange kind of rubbery smell to them. I soaked them in Oxy-Clean for about an hour and then washed them and that helped but they still have that same faint smell. For the money I am disgusted. But because they are still nice and warm, I did go ahead and give them the 3 stars."
1,Too Expensive!,$23.07 for a pair of socks?! Can't be real. Had to return them. Know that you will only get one color.
4,Fuzzy Socks.,"There were a lot of reviews that said these were cheap and thin and got holes in them, but my mom loves them."
4,quick delivery,"these were perfect for a christmas basket for my boyfriend's mom. exactly what I was expecting, and arrived very fast. good quality and great price"
2,"Nice to the touch, unpleasant to wear","These socks are wonderful to touch, soft and silky, but the individual threads that make up the socks are actually quite coarse and hard. When I wear them I think I can feel every single thread under my feet. This is likely not going to be the experience of everyone who buys this product, but my feet are sensitive and I purchased these socks thinking I was buying something that would make my feet feel good. Could not have been more disappointed."
2,Warm and fuzzy but poor quality,"The product is cute, warm and fuzzy, but one sock popped a big hole in the side after 4 days of bed use. Could be a fluke, but tough to say."
5,Wonderful!,I just got these today and quickly opened a pack and put them on. I live in Alaska and it's that time of year again to get the winter clothes out. I was simply amazed how warm soft the socks are and they go all the way to my calves! I approve of these socks and recommend them to anyone.
5,So soft & pretty,They are perfect for lounging at home. They are so soft and comfortable. I ordered the pink socks and I am very pleased!
4,Review of Ult guide to Dogs,Great show on dogs. Full of unusual and interesting information. My favorite segment was on the domesticated foxes.
1,"wrong color,never for any women hand size,extra,extra large","The picture shows that it's white with pink design, I ordered large since they don't have medium/large, I received white with black design, the large size is extra large, I can't use it, will never buy this product again."
3,They run REALLY small,"I read the other reviews, but did I listen? I have very small hands, actually the only thing small on me, but I digress. I always buy small golf gloves, and I buy alot of gloves. So for the price I bought three pairs of these gloves. They ARE very nice and the price can't be beat. BUT, they are so small. I put them on and couldn't close my hand. I wore them to drive the car just to break them in. They do not have that nice little reinforced patch on the palm on the hand which I like so much. I will keep these, maybe I can break them in, not worth it to send them back. But buy them a size larger than normal. I think in the future I will continue to buy Callaway which are more expensive but they have the reinforced palm which is where I wear down the glove.Delivery was very good and packaging was excellent."
2,small & scratched,"looks nice, but runs very small. Mine was a bit damaged when I received it: palm had scratches on it."
4,good fit,"I bought these for my daughter who's just taking up the game. Soft and good fit, she loves them. She doesn't have enough experience to compare and I couldn't fit into them, but they appear to be good quality and she reports that they have good grip and are comfy."
2,"returned, but not refund","I bought two, they were too small for me. I returned back in December, 2010, but have not got refund till now."
4,very pleased,"I had an occasion to use this glove on my last golf outing. It was well fitting and comfortable. I had originally purchased it as an ""extra"" for my bag. I like it so well, it may be my go to next time out."
1,wrong glove sent,The glove is nice and would probably work well had they sent me the correct hand. When ordering it asks for hand orientation...which I am right handed so checked that. Then they shipped me a glove for my right hand. Aren't golfers supposed to wear the glove on the opposite hand?
3,order up on this one ladies!,I ordered this glove in a medium but this glove runs small... it was very tight and not comfy so I gave it to a friend with much smaller hands.. order up on this one...it's a nice glove otherwise.
3,Not as good as I first thought,"The leather on the index finger on the TOP part of the golve has now split/separated on 3 pairs of these gloves, after only a few wearings. They feel comfortable and are true to size. But don't think I'll get anymore the way the leather keeps separating."
4,A good book for the newcomer to art...,"but nothing new for the artist. That said, the book is nevertheless well written. The style is reminiscent of the creative flow experience itself. This book does a good job helping the newbie to understand what flow feels like and how to obtain that state. The exercises are very practical and tend to balance the ""flow-like"" text. I loved the illustrations. I keep going back to the book just to look at the art work."
3,Introduction (only) to art,"The budding (junior high to high school) artist may find this a nice thought provoking gift, but the experienced artist will find little to nourish them here. I found some of the explanations somewhat simplistic and the language of the book itself is somewhat like the type of poetry you read and cannot remember a word of the next moment."
4,"As you get older, you realize that most cliches are true...","...so says Anderson Cooper in his latest article in ""Details"" magazine. I think he's right.""Latter Days"" was fun and moving. No, it wasn't ""A Tale of Two Cities"", but who needs soggy literature? Our economy sucks, our soldiers are dying, and I, for one, enjoy some decent but lighter entertainment. ""Latter Days"" isn't fluff, but it's not going to send you off to cut your wrists, either. We need more books like this (and yes, this adaptation is WAY better than the film). We need hope and humanity in the face of the radical religious right. ""Latter Days"" gives us that.So, Janeh, get a life. Stop the hard-fisted book reviews and dust off that unpublished manuscript you're obviously holding against other published authors who are enjoying the success you wish you had. I hate sour grapes. Lighten up, and let the rest of us enjoy ""Latter Days""."
3,Never saw the film,"I haven't seen the film but I do get the idea it would be better than the book. The POV shifts are distracting and the side-characters' slight developement added nothing to the plot. I wanted to read about Christian and Aaron, not Traci, Ryder and Keith. The overall story was nice and sweet but the ending seemed rushed and didn't ring very real to me. It looks from the reviews that the movie would be the better choice in this case."
5,Great Book!,"I really enjoyed this book. The tranformations of aaron and christian are amazing and beautifully depicted. Though the story is not a surprising one, the character development is great. I would recommend this book to others & then send them to see this movie. There are some stellar performances!!!"
1,"stereotyped, and oh-so cliche","From all the recent hype, I checked out Latter Days as soon as I could, read it in one sitting, and absolutely hated it. The scenes, seperate from the book (as seen on in the movie trailer) is actually quite beautiful, but once it's put back into the novel and subjected to pages of plotless, mindless writing that has no moral and no endearing connection to the reader, the scenes lose their value. It's a cheap love story, the main problem being that the book is unable to convince the reader that between Christian and Aaron there is truly a love beyond physical attraction. It's shallow and uses the age-old, used and abused idea of the series of ""miraculous incidents"" in which, at the very end (and only by chance!) do the two lovebirds come together ""as one"". The author's stab is humor is pitiful, and the book is so horrific it may be hard to put it down. I highly recommend any book of Jim Grimsley's over Latter Days, which has as much value as a broken penny."
3,A passive character caught up in terrible events.,"Baumgartner, a German Jew, gets to India as a teenager, ""escaping"" the Holocaust. He makes a living there until his Indian patron dies, then retires at an early age into poverty. He never gets over the death of his mother, who refused to emigrate. He is a totally passive personality whose one joy is caring for stray cats in his small apartment. Not only is he a dull protagonist, but Desai withholds the few interesting parts of his life until toward the end. Is Desai investigating bigger themes, by looking at the world and Indian society through the eyes of such a character? Is she trying to prove that even such a person is worth exploring? More likely the former, since this is not really an in depth character study. The events pallidly reflected are interesting, Desai is a good writer, Baumgartner arouses some feelings of empathy, so book is readable."
3,Not Exciting,"The title of this DVD is misleading, there is little to no interaction between the girls. The segements are boring and the girls are not too attractive, no playmates. There is one exciting segment, the rest is just bunch of tame dancing. There are lots of better Playboy DVD's out there."
3,Not as good as the first,"Its pretty good,but I recommend the first Girlfriends or the new Roommates."
1,Tubes are defective and leak,"You need to be prepared for broken, leaking tubes from J F Lazartigue. And, don't bother to contact the company, their customer service is terrible. So, occasionally you will have to return an item.But, the good new is, the products are much less expensive on Amazon than direct from JFL."
4,three & a half starz cos it's too short,"I'll round up to 4stars cos although it's a short album (imagine 80 minutes of Creamy ""goodness"" wow!)it's still the legendary Cream. NSU rocks hard and da Cream machine is in full throttle mode. ""Sleepy Time Time"" is a groovy thang penned by Bruce & their rendition of da country blues classic,""Lawdy Mama"", sound a lot like Johnny Winter's early seventies country blues boogie ramblings. Sweet Wine, i usually skip when i listen to dis cd, a little too much meandering even for a jam bam loving cat like myself. it is the longest track and imo the most waste of space on this cd. Rollin And Tumblin sounds identical to the band's Strange Brew except retains the original lyrics of the tradition country blues ballad which Clapton later reworked as Strange Brew."
4,Live Cream,"It came as expected. I was familiar with the album, and was a great old album. Prompt delivery, good condition, definitely okay."
3,Disappointing,Not as strong as I had hoped it would be. A real disappointment. The band just doesn't sound tight or as inspired as on other live efforts.
5,My daughters love it!,My 2 daughters 3 & 18 months love this CD...they dance and jump & sing for the whole CD!
4,Funk For All,"If Funk was a crime, anybody that listened to this would be arrested for 1st degree Funketeering. Honestly, who does't like this magnum opus of Funk and entrancing, childish melodies and bright harmonies that will make you poop bubblegum for a week. Listening to this got me beat up at school but who cares, this album gives me a sense of elation that allow me to transend all pain through the power of pure Funk.To quote someone, ""We got the Funk, give up that Funk""I also recommend the show. It also contains high levels of unadulterated Funk. I honestly believe this will protect me from the nightmare world as predicted by Revelations.Funk OUT!"
5,Dragon Tunes Terrific,I got hooked on Dragon Tales when I was babysitting a little boy who loved them and I still like them. I always enjoyed the music and when I found this CD I had to have it. The songs are mostly peppy cheer you right up songs and my favorite is Doodlie Do. Some of the songs are longer than on the tv show which is good and rest assured if you are buying this for a child you won't have to worry about the songs being inappropiate or annoying.Dragon TunesYou should give this a listen and who knows you might become a fan yourself.
5,Shake Your Dragon Tale!,Our daughter loves dancing and playing to the songs on this disc. It's upbeat for her and not too sugary or chirpy for us. Tons of good beats to encourage a developing sense of rhythm and movement. Excellent for playtime!
4,"Wonderful, a real lifesaver!","I got this cd for my son during about three years ago on a vacation. He was three back then. He's almost six now, and he still loves listening to it, and so do we, his parents. No matter how many times we listen to it, it never gets boring, and we even got my 1 1/2 year old nephew into it. My son's favorite song on this one is ""Cassie."" Mom and Dad like ""Hello,"" ""Doodli-Do,"" ""Wake Up"" and ""Hum."""
2,"Good guide to the battlefield, average history","Uffindell clearly spent lots of time walking the battlefield and has an excellent knowledge of it. He is also enthusiatic about his subject and the book is a good read. However, it is bad history. Too often, the myths about the campaign are repeated as fact. Too often questionable statements by Uffindell's hero Wellington are taken at face value. Of course, the British did nothing worng in this campaign and foreigners like the Prince of Orange, Dornberg and Ziethen are to blame for Wellington's errors. This book is very much inferior to Hofschroer's work."
4,A good concise summary of the battle of Ligny,"This book summarises the battle of Ligny neatly, putting it in tactical context with the twin battle of Quatre-Bras and 2 days later, in strategic context with Waterloo.Wellington comes across as an overly cautious general, Blucher as an over-enthusiastic general.And Napoleon? He continued to belittle the capabilities of his opponents, underestimated their fighting prowess, was careless, and was ultimately let down by his own generals and sloppy staffwork. Napoleon had himself to blame. Great opening moves, but failed to win the mid-game and was checkmated in the end-game."
3,"Not her best, but better than most other people's anyway...","At the moment, I own five Lavin studio albums, and this one trails the pack in overall satisfaction. Perhaps that is because I am male, and ""Compass"" seems to me to be more ""female-focused"" than her other discs. For instance, ""High heel shoes"" and ""Prisoners of their hairdos"" seem in subject matter to be of more interest to women anyway, but what bothers me is the execution...I just don't like the arrangements and the vocal style Christine chooses on these. However, I do like four songs here quite a bit, and that's more than one finds on most recordings to savor. My favorites are ""Blind Dating Fun"", ""Replaced"", ""I Bring Out the Worst in You"" and ""Katy Says Today is the Best Day of my Entire Life."" If I were introducing Christine to someone I hoped would become a new fan, this isn't the disc I'd pick...but if you are already a fan and have most of her other product, you'll want this one also."
5,Alarming (but not alarmist),"An excellent call-to-arms, passionately written and exhaustively researched work about climate change and what it means for the future of the planet and mankind. If you're interested in educating yourself about Global Warming, this is an excellent place to start. My only complaint about this book is that Flannery's prose is maddeningly inconsistent. At times it's eloquent and bristling with urgency, at other times muddled and clumsy in its delivery. However, these are petty criticisms. The message of the book is the main thing and it's powerful - climate change is a serious threat to all of us and unless we do something about it right now it may be too late. Read it and decide for yourself what you can do. Recommended."
5,Converting the non converted,"Like many people I always thought, maybe hoped, that the whole global warming thing was exaggerated. After all, when I was a kid we got told that we were heading for another Ice Age only to be warned some years later of a global warming problem?!?!.While at school a big fuss was also made about the depleting Ozone layer; something that somehow managed to drop out of the public debate since then. Not thinking about it too much, I suppose I felt that either the scientists initially exaggerated the problem or they easily found a way to fix it - something they could do again in future, should the need arise...Flannery puts all this (and much more) in context. He provides the complete picture as well as remedies needed and solutions available. All of this is done in a sober, reasonable and non-judgmental way.It is a gripping read that is as accessible as it is valuable. A must read for a generation that literally holds the key to the climatic future of Earth."
1,Who is he ?,"Tim Flannery is a paleontologist and mammologist. And a good one. He is also an environmental activist. As an activist, he has no background in climatology, meteorology or any subject even vaguely related to anthropogenic GW. Sorry ......P.S. he got the ""Ocker"" of the year award in Down-under. There is a very significant number of Australian scientists who do not support his man-madeglobal warming nonsense."
5,Authoritative report on global warming,"Global warming, caused by greenhouse gas emissions, is an incontrovertible, unassailable fact. Yes, a few flat-earth folks remain who argue that more proof is still needed. Thousands of objective technical reports, published in refereed scientific journals, clearly show the case is already made. In the scientific community, there is no debate: Climate change, caused by humans, is here. And, unless we quickly do something about it, the end results could be cataclysmic. We recommend Tim Flannery's impassioned book about climate change. This book will thoroughly educate you regarding the dangers of global warming and will tell you what you can do to address this shared problem. It is hard to imagine a more vital topic."
5,must read for informed citizens,"flannery treads where few science writers can go. similar to jared daimond and bill bryson, flannery takes a vital but complex topic -- global warming -- and creates a readable, coherent, thought-provoking book.personally, i fall into the ""green"" camp so i am among flannery's core audience -- those who already believe global warming is a threat. but this book should be read by anyone with an interest, whichever side of the fence you are on."
5,Balanced but urgent message,I felt this book took a balanced view while at the same time stressed the urgency the author (and many other scientists) feel for addressing green house gas emissions. I felt that the author looked past politics and special interest groups (both green and non-green) to present real approaches for a rapid change in our coal and oil consumption habits.
2,Over 1000 measurements of CO2 over the years -count 'em!,"I rarely buy two books sight unseen (hardcover much less), but in a moment of weakness (or wisdom), I bought The Winds of Change by Eugene Linden as well as The Weather Makers by Tim Flannery. I wanted to get a solid, firm understanding about global warming and climate - a scientific and historical perspective to be able to sort out all the noise. Interestingly enough, I heard Tim Flannery on the radio and it was his book that steered me to the purchase of these two. I stopped reading The Weather Makers about halfway through. I got so tired after reading about the one thousanth, four hundreth and thirty second CO2 readings over the past that I just stopped reading it. While the empirical data was presented, the discussion on climate and how civilization was and is affected over the milleniums was weak at best and often missing. If you want a book that has it all, may I reccomend Eugene Linden's ""The Winds Of Change."""
4,Brings global warming's effects to life,"This book raises awareness of the biological effects of global warming, and poses the problems well."
5,The big picture on climate change,"The Weather Makers is stunning in its breadth and depth. The author has intense personal experiences and a host of references to make a compelling case for the complex reality of the effects of climate change. I have been motivated to donate carbon funds to offset the carbon footprint of a family of four, not just for my wife and myself. I also intend to inform my grown children and all my friends about the phenomenon of global warming, and why and how to combat it."
2,Endless tivia about species in trouble,"I was excited to tackle this book, but my excitement faded quickly. The prose are not streamlined and there is no substantive thread to tie the quote-fronted chapters together. Of particular annoyance was the author's obsession with going through a qualitative and repetitive laundry-list of species that are rare and in trouble. Perhaps if this list were presented in conjunction with some historical perspective this could have worked, but as is, it really doesn't.I would recommend taking a look at Ruddiman's recent book on climate and humans if you want a real perspective on the role that the ""weather makers"" have had on the physical climate system, but I have no suggestion for a good and historically-grounded book on the biological effects of human-induced climate change."
5,Solid explanation,Flannery's book is the best single treatment of climate change I have seen. It is solidly scientific in it's approach while remaining very accessible. I highly recommend it.
2,Keds Champion Sneaker,I bought this sneaker from my Mom who has worn the same style for years. I'm sorry to say that we were not happy with our purchase - it seems that the mold for the shoe has changed - the stitching on the top of the shoe is in a different place and does not make this a comfortable shoe for my mom.
2,not true to size,I donated these sneakers to Goodwill without ever wearing them. They were not true to size and for the price I did not want the hassle of returning them. I will not purchase any Keds in the future.
4,Good shoe for good price,The shoes came earlier than expected and were in good shape. They were brand new and in the box and the size was correct.
2,Supplier,"The shoes are good quality Keds however I believe you have a supplier problem. The shoes that arrived had been worn. I called the supplier and he offered to send a new pair if I returned the pair I had. He made a good offer however, I decided to wash the shoes and keep them, which I did. Now, I have an infection on my toe. Not good."
1,Disaster,"3 weeks after buying these shoes, i washed them with whites in cold water and the blue insole completely bled onto the white and now the shoes are ruined. This never happened to the cheap Target brand we bought. I have to throw them away. The insole doesn't come out so I can't even try to bleach them."
2,disappointed,"I got these shoes in December and they are VERY cheap. NOT worth the money. I could have gone to a local store and paid a lot less. Additionally, the shoes I received did not look like the shoe in the photo. The shoe i received was more of a sketcher type shoe with a longer top. I would NOT recommend them to a friend or relative. They are not what i expected. the top of the shoe is already coming apart. I've had Keds before and I don't know if it was just this pair, but I will not buy shoes this way again."
2,Wide Width?,I like the shoe but I am not too sure it is a wide width shoe. It fitted more medium width.
3,NICE SHOES WRONG COLOR,BOUGHT THESE SHOES FOR MY GIRL. WE ORDERED BLACK AND WHITE BUT WHEN RECIEVED THE SHOES THEY WERE ALL BLACK. SHE SAYS THEY ARE COMFORTABLE BUT WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED FOR NOT GETTING THE COLOR SHE WANTED
2,too narrow,"Even though I ordered my normal size, these shoes pinched my toes painfully. I ended up throwing them in a donation box."
3,Satisfied,Not as red as pictured. Overall I'm ok with the item but keep in mind that the colors are not as vibrant as pictured.
4,Navy Keds Sneaker,"The fit is perfect.I also ordered the exact same pair in black. The Black and Navy are so similar in color, I really only needed to order the black. The color is exactly as pictured.Prompt arrival."
5,Just what I wanted!,"These shoes are exactly what I wanted! I needed a comfortable, light weight shoe for vacation and I came across these Keds and I am happy about my purchase. Super fast shipping, and a beautiful product."
3,Not sure if it is my fault,I bought them thinking they would be like my keds I've own for sometime. The are called the original. They looked the same unless you get really close and see the inside isn't terry cloth they are cheaper made. I bought a med it is what I wear but i'm in the process of trying to stretch them out. Wetting them and putting them over objects to stretch them since they are so tight. Length is right but they are narrow now with wetting them the blue from the soles have come up and i'll now have to deal with that. So what can I say - could have returned them you have always been great but thought I could stretch them out since i've been unable to find the ked original in the store.
3,Love red but blue was too narrow,I ordered two pair. One red and one blue. I love the red ones but the blue ones was not true to size. The blue ones seemed more narrow then the red ones. If you order blue you may want to try the wide in them.
3,Quality has definitely slipped over the years,... you know the aggravation when you get a pair of shoes that make your socks slip down at the heel ...
3,I'd like them if they fit,"I have fat feet, and I wear a size 12 wide. I ordered the 12 E, and they were long enough and wide enough, but not ""tall"" enough. I couldn't get the tops of my feet crammed in them, even when I loosened the laces. There's just no stretch to the canvas. They seemed like they'd be comfortable if I could just get them on! So those of you with fat feet, get something else!Returning them was so easy though, and only took a few days."
2,Too Narrow,I bought these for an 80s party and they were so narrow and had no arch support that I am returning them. Please note I do not have a wide foot at all but they were very uncomfortable. Fine in 3rd grade but horrible now. Some stuff should be left in the 80s!!
3,not the original quality I expected,"I had read that Keds was going back to its original quality rubber sole, but these have the same thin flappy soles that Keds have had for the last few years. The upper is also somewhat thin and scratchy, not like the original quality. I won't be fooled again."
2,The Keds sizing is hard to figure.,"In any shoe I ideally I wear a 7 1/2 W. I usually end up with an 8 M because there is no wide width offered. This summer I wanted canvas tennis shoes for summer and decided to try some Keds. There seems to be no consistency of sizing, however, between colors or styles, and I have had to try different colors and styles due to ""not available"" items. Several years ago I had a Keds size 8 M and it was a little bit too long and slightly snug. So this year I tried the Chambray blue 7 1/2 W and it was too long, but wide enough. I returned the Chambray and got stone 7 W (no Chambray available in 7 W) and it was waaay too short and very tight. I don't think a size 8 W would even fit. This idea of shoes ""running small"" or ""running large"" makes no sense to me. Just make the shoe the size that is stamped on it."
4,Great color - a tish too narrow,"I loved absolutely everything about my pair of Keds - excellent throwback to my elementary school years - however, they were a tish too narrow for my big flippers so they had to be returned unfortunately.The yellow laces definitely gave the graphite color a pop that made the Keds cute and fun. I might hafta order this in a wider size... :D"
2,quality???,"I bought the white leather sneakers for $38 at a DSW store awhile ago. Let me tell you, they do NOT last. I bought Keds hoping for a quality, practical, and stylish shoe that I could wear with anything for a few years. This is what you could expect a few years ago, that Keds were STRONG shoes. Well surprise, they barely lasted one season. The bottom sole of the shoe came unglue from the rest of the shoe, and most of the white leather chipped off leaving patches of brown. Looks terrible, no way worth my $40."
3,"Ked's - not made the way they used to be, but a reasonable value for the money","Bought white Keds for my daughter. She loves them, but after just 4 weeks they are showing structural wear and tear. They were only $20, so not over the top expensive, but I remember when Keds lasted for multiple seasons so I guess I am nostalgic..."
2,Ked Sneakers,The shipping cost was less than what it would have cost me in gas to go the store to buy
