3,90s guns was bettah,"i had this for like three weeks before the regular stream broke. this is a useful gun when the other team is in a pack you can waste half your tank on the flood thing. the regular stream stinks. this gun was great for two days until it strarted leaking! the most useless thing on this squirt gun is the valve on the lid because i load it with a spigot and the valve would make it longer to to load. hasbro has gone down hill with supah soakah. now, i love supah soakah but the larami 90s ones will always be da best i still beast wuth my brothahs 270 xp and da SS50, the monster XP,the cps 1000, and the xp 65 . all the 90s one had cool names but now the ""flashflood"" ""arctic shock"" and the funny ""MR. Tikisoki"" hasbro has gone down hill. bad gun"
3,Careful,"I bought a flash flood a few days ago.The bad thing was is when i bought it and filled it with water,the stream shot didnt work. So if you plan on buying it wish,that the one your going to buy works.Although the big flash flood shot is pretty cool.A flash flood/shield blaster combo works wonders. I almost never got wet,and i drenched all my friends with the flash flood shot.Overall it's a good gun."
1,Flash flood,"This gun is probably the worst gun i have ever used in my life. And thats saying something. The quality is absoloutley apaulling as well. I have had it four days. Four days and I didn't even have a water fight. It broke anyway. The flash flood mode does not work at all. Four days: broken. Leaks. Everytime I pump it now, it squirts a small mist, not enough to soak anybody. And, because of this, it never has any pressure, so the normal gun doesn't work either. It also made an annoying hissing sound every time I pumped it, meaning I had to press the ""Quick fill"" cap down to stop the hissing, and the cap doesn't even work with the aqaupack that I also bought with it. The gun was fun while it lasted, but that was for half an hour. Pure rubbish. Dont waste money and buy this."
3,A Good Effort,"I have very mixed feelings about this book. As a native of New Orleans who snaps up any book she can kind dealing with its history, I have to say this was not one of my personal favorites. It wasn't a bad book, but it wasn't a real page turner either. I like the way it was written, using 3 points of view to convey the story and the story itself was not bad. I just really didn't like the characters with the exception of Millicent and I wish there had been more of her insights in this book. She was the only one I really cared about in the whole book. I also felt there was too much left out of this book for readers who may not be familiar with New Orleans' history pertaining to yellow fever, quadroons, customs etc. It did spark my interest in daugerrotypes and I plan to soon visit some museums to look at some of them, but other than that, I didn't take much away from this one."
1,"yellow jack, a novel",no social redeeming value.....I am truly sorry that I spent time reading this book. Can I have my money back?
3,A good story but overall disappointing,"The reference to Caleb Carr on the back of the book caused me to purchase and read this novel. I must say, however, that I was not as taken with this book as I had hoped. Mr. Russell does a good job of creating interesting characters and presenting a solid story. However, I found myself wanting to learn alot more about each one. I also felt that one of the strongest characters, the City of New Orleans itself, was not fully utilized. All of the mystery,character and perpetual decay of that time and place could have enhanced the descent and increasing madness of Russell's characters. Some of that heavy, sensual, moldering place was apparent but not as much as it may have needed to be. All in all, this was a good read but I just didn't feel it fulfilled its potential."
2,An admirable attempt,"While the characters are strongly built and an interesting structural device has been built in, YELLOW JACK never quite gets off the ground. Every once in awhile the characters will do things simply to push the story in the direction the author wants, and the novel itself doesn't really seem to have a point or any sort of conviction. What is quite admirable are the museum catalog descriptions that extrapolate from the speaker's life based on his art, and then the actual descriptions on that life from the speaker himself. But in the end its not quite worth the effort."
3,My patience wore thin.,"Widows Wear Weeds is one of the Cool and Lam mysteries written by Erle Stanley Gardner under the pseudonym A.A. Fair. Private Eye Donald Lam provides the narration.This is a convoluted tale of blackmail and murder which unfolds in Los Angeles. This is the same Los Angeles readers will recognize from Raymond Chandler's novels starring Philip Marlowe. Seductive dames, less than honest cops, houses of great wealth, seedy residential hotels, cheating husbands and grifters on the make.Unfortunately, Lam is no Marlowe and this book is little more than a collection of hardboiled crime cliches cobbled together to make a rather unsatisfying, though mercifully short, detective novel.Of historical interest because of the identity of the author. Aside from that there is little reason to recommend Widows Wear Weeds."
3,Unlikable Characters,"Ultimately, I was disappointed in this first volume of the notorious Forstye Saga. It offers quite a few interesting facets, probably the best of which is the skillful use of a distant narrative (the family's perspective) through which to highlight the intimate events of Soames's and Irene's failing marriage. It also presents an incisive look at the mindset of the turn-of-the-century wealthy English. But, at the end of the day, my biggest beef with the book is simply that I failed to like it through failing to like any of the characters. With the exception of Old Jolyon and perhaps June, there's not a likable character in the bunch and not enough of intellectual fascination to make it up for me."
5,a great description on the roots of military failure,"This is a execellent book at describing the stagnation of the British navy during the ninenteenth century. According to the author, the British navy put more of a emphasis on character and less on intellect in the devolopment of it's officer corps. This led to all the most intellectual officers being ignored but the one that obeyed the rules were promoted to the highest ranks. Because of the above metioned factors the British navy faced near disaster at Jutland. One can see the tragic consequences when character dominates intellect in an institution."
4,"Highly insightful, balanced","Normally the bias of an author presents itself when presenting a controversial subject. At the time, Jutland was a very controversial battle, in that the RN let the German fleet ""get away"" and couldn't bring them to decisive battle. This book presents an in depth analysis of the ""causes"" of the controversy without assigning blame, i.e., the reasons for the fleet dispositions, the possible ambiguity in signalling, the personalities of the high officers, etc. It even gives a blow-by-blow account of the battle, including some very useful time-elapsed type charts, based on positions of wrecks.Having said that, as an amateur historian, I found the book to be overly detailed for my purposes. I still recommend it for anyone interested in RN tactics in WWI, or in the Battle itself, but I think real naval historians will appreciate the subtleties more than I can."
1,Not a good idea.....,"Well I thought this might be nice for my husband's birthday gift so he could carry around pictures of our daughter, but when he downloaded them, it was quite disappointing to say the least. You can't make out the faces and the quality is poor :(I wish I'd have read a review before buying this, just trying to save you some money cause I spent over $50 with shipping and I just wasted $ I don't have to waste..."
1,"Small, Dim, Lousy Resolution, Clunky Software","I don't know why the other reviewers acknowledged this product's many faults and then gave it high marks anyway. The software crashed my computer on install (Windows XP). When it worked, it's extremely clunky to use -- and you go through all that trouble to look at a *very* low resolution 1"" screen that's pretty dim.This would be fine as a blister packed 9.95 novelty item for kids, but it's packaged like an executive gift and is pretty pricey -- getting close to dedicated viewers like one from Kodak. Steer clear."
2,"OK, just don't expect too much","This product is cheap and basically does what it promises. It may deserve more stars because of that, but it just isn't very high quality. Photos are hard to see given size and resolution of screen. You need good head shots and not much else. There are larger more expensive products of this type out there. I'd go that route rather than purchase this again."
2,Bad Photo Quality,Great idea but they have to come up with a way to make the picture look better on the screen. It does not matter what you do to the picture as far as editing it just wont come out looking crisp. Hopefully my husband will like it as I have bought it for him as a birthday gift. I guess he will just have to use some of his imagination when looking at the pictures of our son.
1,Chain did not hold up.,This item is only as good as the weakest link in the chain. It is meant to hang on your keychain after all.The chain came apart shortly after being put on my wifes keys.The picture viewer now lives in a drawer.
1,"good idea, big dissapointment","I worked for two hours trying to get this to function correctly. I tried to make the images as small as possbile so that they would display - nothing worked. Except the demo photos. Following the recommendation of the other post, I'm going to edit them in another photo editor.It seems like quite a lot of work for the novelty."
1,"General Foods International Coffee, Sugar Free Fat Free Naturally Decaffeinated Suisse Mocha Coffee Drink Mix (Twelve-4.4 Ounce","My purchase was for 12 4.4 tins of sugar free, fat free, Decaffeinated instant coffee and twice I was sent a single can of the wrong coffee. Customer service refused to replace the order and get me the right item after the second mistake. I had to print a mail label and take the item to the post office. Very frustrating experience. No resolution to get me what I ordered.Not a happy customer.S Saviano"
5,I'll Be Thrilled if THIS Ever Gets Released on DVD,"I've never forgotten the laughs from this 1984 Lorne Michaels ""The New Show,"" that was much like SNL but in primetime, and consistently funny. GREAT sketch comedy, musical guests and retro-America graphics. I especially loved ""The Frightened Family,"" with John Candy, Steve Martin's Billie Jean Video spoof, Roy's Food Repair (John Candy w/Paul Simon!) and...The Naughty Lady with the Quaid brothers.[...]"
5,A great collection of songs on this karaoke disc,SHANIA TWAIN1 FROM THIS MOMENT ON2 YOU'RE STILL THE ONE3 DON'T BE STUPID4 GOD BLESS THE CHILD5 HOME AIN'T WHERE HIS HEART IS6 HONEY I'M HOME7 LOVE GETS ME EVERY TIME8 MAN I FEEL LIKE A WOMAN9 THAT DON'T IMPRESS ME MUCH10 THE WOMAN IN ME11 YOU WIN MY LOVE12 I'M OUTTA HERE13 I'M HOLDIN' ON TO LOVE (TO SAVE MY LIFE)
5,The best historical account in Buddhism,"This is the most accurate, best written, historical account of Shakiamuni Buddha and his teachings. It is regarded as the clearest and most detailed introductions to the fundamental teachings of Buddhism available in English. Venerable Narada explains the doctrines as they have been preserved in the Theravada tradition. A MUST read, for begginers,seasoned practitioners and anyone interested in Buddhist philosophy."
3,"Not as Expected, and Somewhat Disappointed","I purchased this single 55W PIAA H3 Xtreme White 'Plus' bulb to replace a similar bulb that had burned out. Regrettably, the burned out bulb was from a set of original (JDM) Xtreme White H3 bulbs (part number 15255; model number H-212E) with a higher Kelvin temperature (4150K) and a significantly more radiant output. Now that I have seen the replacement bulb lit, it is clearly not a match in color or output. Disappointing, to say the least. And this is coming from a HUGE PIAA fan.On a separate note, the bulb's packaging is underwhelming, but not unexpected. At least Amazon packaged the whole shipment very well (as usual)."
3,Hello Kitty,Uuummmm well if you really like Hello Kitty and you like collecting Hello Kitty items this may be for you . It has a really kiddy like theme but overall it's really cute to see Sanrios most loved charactor on your screen . I thought it was fun and pretty cool .
2,Take a look for yourself before buying.,"If you really like and admire the work of Philip-Lorca diCorcia then this book may be really tempting, however take care, the beautifully lit and composed work that you are used to is only a small fraction of this book. the rest is made up of landscape work which veers away from the rich vein of work that have brought him success, and in many cases these photographs are not that good when compared with the landscape work being produced by many of his contemporarys. Take a look for yourself before buying."
4,Kathleen Madigan: fun on the road,both my husband and I enjoy listening to Kathleen. Enjoyed the tape on our Christmas ride to Savannah. Plan on getting more of her CD's
5,I laugh every time,"I can't remember how I first heard Kathleen Madigan, but I can listen to this CD over and over and laugh every time.She is sharp and funny; she looks at us and sees our quirks, shows them to us, and makes us laugh.Whenever I need a moment of levity, I grab one of Kathleen Madigan's CDs and listen."
1,Not worth the time or money,"This book would have been a good read in the time leading up the 2012 election (July 2005), but now it is so out of date that it's almost useless. If you're looking for insight only to the facts of the competing bids then this books will help you, but for most Olympic fans, this book offers little new."
1,I HATE IT!,"i really don't like it because i pay for it and theres no glue that come with it. the quality is ok but too hard to assemble. there almost nothing there to hold it but glue, has small picks stick out of it. JUST DON'T BUY THIS!! not even its 2 $"
3,Love! but...,"The only reservation I have with this track is that it is quite literally straight from the movie. There is no grace or flow when going from one song to the next, and a lot of the songs are seconds long because of this. Would have appreciated this info when trying to determine the difference in my options. Hope it helps you, still love 'The Wizard of Oz' :)"
4,wizard of oz soundtrack,"the soundtrack was what I wanted for my granddaughter, all the original songs on it. The quality could have been a little better though."
5,Being Joy,I purchased this soundtrack for a mentally challenged person. He loves the movie and would sing along. Being able to listen to the music gives him joy.
5,cd,I play this for all my grandchildren. They love all the musical I play for them and they ask to hear them over and over.
4,nice for a casual day,"I was really excited to see this offered in the store and the price wasn't so bad so I bought it. My main problem with this set is the bag; I had a very difficult time filling up the base with just the right amount of water. Once I got over that hurdle I did the first dvd. Take my advice and skip this one, this is the one that has the awkward moves. The second dvd is much better but it is not a very ""intense"" workout. I use it when I'm too lazy to do something hard and want a fun little workout. I still have to re-inflate the bag ever so often because it'll just fall down when I punch it(I guess air leaks out.) So give it a try if you want to mix up your routine and like the novelty of hitting a bag at home."
2,"One Worked, One woke the house up","The concept is great and so is the price. I bought two of these at the same time. It turns out that about 2 am one of them decided to malfunction with loud blasts of ""FIRE FIRE FIRE"" warnings and ""Carbon Monoxide"". The good thing is I can say it will wake you up in an emergency but one just had a problem the other is fine. I am now working on getting the company to replace it and they seem to be very helpful in doing so."
5,"Good sensor, fast readout","I have owned one of these for the last three years. There has been no problem. Since the display is always showing ""0,"" I was wondering if it would ever change. So put it near my car's exhaust pipe. Wow, within a few seconds, it jumped from 0 to 900! It backed down to 0 in a couple of minutes after I moved it to fresh air. So it was working all the time, even the display never changed when I had it near my furnace."
5,greate because its digital,"after a few days from purchasing this detector , my wife left the oven on a low number, in the morning when i woke up i sew the detector shows number 30, i looked around from where its coming, then i found that its coming from the oven i called the company why it dosent ring the alarm, they told me its not ringing before number 40 and they told me to open the window, after few seconds it went down to 0 so its sounds great."
4,"Fine, better-than-basic CO alarm","This is a good, high-quality device, with a clear display. The display is a little smaller and contains a little less than the earlier version of this same detector (of which I own two), which is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. But it works well, as best I could test it (using the vent from my gas oven), with a clear, easy-to-read display. The ability to change batteries without dismounting it is a plus. I bought this model (earlier and current versions) because it was highly rated and a good buy according to Consumer Reports, and it lives up to that review."
5,An excellent CO2 detector,"Purchased the Kidde KN-COPP-B detector from Amazon several weeks ago. it's quite easy to set up and mount, and appears to be very reliable. I chose this particular Kidde detector because it includes a digital display which allows the owner to actually check and see CO2 levels. (I'm apprehensive about other units which simply trip an alarm when high CO2 levels are detected - - which makes me wonder whether they are really functional).I tested this unit by holding it above our kitchen range and it promptly displayed a high reading, and returned to a zero reading when removed from that environment. I'm very satisfied with this model which performs as expected, and at a very economical price. Strongly recommend it to all."
4,kidde monoxide detector,product arrived on time in perfect condition. Altho the manual is slightly confusing I think the item operates as advertised.I just wish it would give periodic readings without having to reset it.
2,More Features than Expected!,"If you like replacing 3 AA batteries every month then this product is for you! More specifically, if you like being woken up between 1-3am with an obnoxious beeping sound, since that's when this alarm decided it needs to be fed. There really is a good reason that every sitcom has done an episode on the smoke detector that goes off in the middle of the night that no one can find, and I'm pretty sure that this was the one that they used (yes, I know this is a CO2 detector). On the bright side, I'm sure this would go off in the event of high CO2 levels...after all nearly everything else sets it off!"
5,KN-COPP-B Carbon Monoxide Alarm,"This replaced my old First Alert Alarm. I liked this one mainly because the old one I had did not offer the digital display and also I can replace the batteries from the front without taking it off it's mount but with the First Alert I had to in order to replace the battery. Shipping from Amazon only took five days using there free shipping. Using this item since March 14, 2009.Update: Just want to say item still works perfectly and never any problems with it. September 3, 2011."
4,Easy to Install; fair price.,"Good quality, reputable company. Battery operated detector is the only choice if you want protection during a power outage."
1,Questionable reliability,"When we bought our house two years ago, two of these were just installed by the seller (due to the new law in Massachusetts). After about a year, one of them started displaying randomly-on segments on the LCD, making the display useless. Presumably the CO alert still works, but who really knows? Then, the other one needed its battery changed, and after I put in the new set, it too has a corrupted display -- but worse, the alarm is stuck on, so it's pretty much broken.And even when they were working, there's another annoyance: the green ""Operate"" light blinks brightly once a minute, which takes some getting used to in a bedroom when you're trying to fall asleep.I'll be shopping for a different brand for replacements"
2,It went haywire after a year. I tossed it.,One day it started signaling for no reason. I changed the batteries and it continued to randomly alarm. This happened in June. We are only using electricity and we don't have cars running in the house ;-).Ours didn't last.
4,Easy alarm,"I liked the ease with which this alarm can be up and running. Just install the batteries, drill two holes, insert screws and hang the alarm. I like its reminder blinking light, which blinks once every 30 seconds so its not too disruptive. I also like the readout which you can check at will."
5,Best Carbon Monoxide Detector!,"I owned the previous model of this carbon monoxide detector and it lasted over 10 years! The digital readout allows you to review any CO levels by just pressing a button. Once, after painting a room, I checked the readout and a low-level reading appeared. After checking the manual I found out that the reading was due to the paint fumes. I feel safer knowing I can check for low-level readings that do not activate CO alarms in order to be aware of a potential problem. Some models do not have this feature and you would not have any way to know of a low-level reading. Also, the CO detector is easy to set up and operate, runs on batteries (included), and may sit on a shelf or be mounted on a wall. I believe this is a high-quality product at a very reasonable price!"
3,Returned,Thought it was carbon monoxide and Smoke. NOPE. My fault. Sent back and purchased a dual unit like I intended.
4,How do I know?,"I've had this item for many months now and it seems to work as advertised. Has shown some minimal CO readings in my home at times and has sounded the low battery alarm recently to alert me to replace the batteries.Bottom line is:1. If it sounds the alarm and there is a HIGH CO level, then it did its' job2. If there are VERY HIGH CO levels and it does not sound the alarm, then I guess I'd give 0 Stars but I wouldn't be able to do that because I'd be dead :("
2,eats batteries,I have 5 of these things in different parts of the house and they all seem to just *devour* batteries!! I get about 4 weeks of use before it starts chirping at me. very annoying and very expensive to run!!I'm still looking for a good replacement.
1,battery chirping again after just opening a new monitor,"I had 2 of these monitors, one was 4 years old and the chirping started, replaced the battery and it was good for a week or 2 then chirping again (this makes the animals very upset and fearful)so I threw it out and opened up a brand new unit. Good for 1 week and again the chirping, changed batteries to fresh, this time only good for a day or two. Threw it out, I'm not going to put the animals and myself through all this upset again.I will never again buy this brand."
2,Bad product. Stay away. Dangerous for your life,I bought this product in 2010 and already twice it failed to detect gas in my home. I came home twice noticing strong smell and turning off the burner that went out. The detector shows 0 level. This is insane! Good thing it was not at night. Happened twoce already and I would DEFINITELY NOT recomment this product to anyone.
1,Misleading List Price,Homedepot sells for $39.99 and in store on-sale for $19.99. 44% saving is a joke.
1,"Broke after 4 months, batch problem","They are great CO detectors, had a few older units and needed some more. Started beeping at 5 AM today with an ""err"" message.From reading around, it seems they have had a batch problem. I will get a replacement from Kidde."
1,Broken.,About a year after purchase the display is reading some cryptic code and will not change. Kind of looks like something smacked it and it's confused.
3,"Fine product, bad batteries","I was happy to see that 3 AA batteries were included with the unit, but found out they were dead when I installed them. Had to go back to the store for more batteries."
5,Not bad at all,"I bought this for my unfinished basement, as I was concerned about the closed ventilation there. The second night I had this up and running it went off with a loud tone.With that I opened all the windows and the basement door, and after awhile it stopped beeping. The next day I had the AC guy come in, and apparently there was something wrong with our pipe connections.Without my detector we could have run into a real bad scenario.I am glad I purchased it, and feel like everyone should have them in their household. These detectors save lives."
5,Kidde 900-0146-004 Nighthawk Carbon Monoxide Alarm,"This is a good quality CO detector at a reasonable price. I like the LED indicator on the front. This feature displays the level of CO in the room rather than just sounding an alarm at a certain level. This way you know if there is a potential problem that is pending, before you actually have one."
2,Not the Best,Easy to set up but batteries need to be replaced way too often for me meaning less then monthly. Frequently gives low battery alarm. Fine but this often happens in the middle of the night. Will purchase different model from other company in the future.
4,no problems yet,easy to set up. have had it for a couple of months and have not had any problems yet.
3,disappointed in expiration date,"The product is great... But knowing the sensor has a 7 year life expectancy, I was very disappointed that the ones I bought from Amazon were already over one year old, per the manf. date on the unit."
4,Do You Need A Miracle,This is a great hit because we all need Miracles in Our Lives. Besides I just love the Brooklyn Tab Choir.
5,Brilliant album left to obscurity......,"After the immense success of ""Hardline..."" I recall looking forward to this album. He had two videos from this project that aired only on VH-1 at the time: This Side of Love and To Know Someone Deeply. I ran to the store and got this on cassette tape and was blown away! It far exceeded my expectations and has always been one of my favorite albums.Sadly, I was the only person I knew that bought it and I have spent years turning people onto this album ever since. The lyrics, music, arrangements, etc. all bear witness to the immense talent that is (not was) Terrence Trent D'Arby (Sananda Maitreya). If you slept on this one as the masses did, do yourself a favor and pick up this soundtrack that almost 20 years later remains an overlooked effort."
2,Follow up disaster,"Unfortunately TTD went off the deep end on this album. Consequently he put off many fans from buying the brilliant next album ""Symphony or Damn"" and the superb follow up ""Vibrator"". If you loved the first album, give this one a miss and get the two I just mentioned. Come on TTD hurry up and release a new album!"
4,Superstar to Commercial Oblivion,"Neither Fish Nor Flesh's downfall is it's lack of real commercial singles and a certain jealous Sony labelmate's sabotage if you believe Terence himself. That's not to say the music here is any worse overall than Hardline. The unofficially Stevie Wonder Summer Soft sampling ""To Know Someone Deeply"", Motown-esque ""Billy Don't Fall"" and the gospel attack of ""I Don't Want To Bring Your God's Down"" are some favourites of mine. Don't believe the hype, there was no dramatic artistic post-Hardline disaster."
4,Good Solid Disc,"hearing the Gospel of I'll be Alright is classic D'arby.this Disc had so much Range&style that it was scary.the Talent Level of this Man is no Joke.as a Writer,arranger,Producer,Instrumentalist&vocalist he is a very complete Artist.alot of folks Slept on this Disc.it's a shame.Billy Don't Fall was Genius.To Know someone deeply is to know someone Softly is a Great Slow-Jam.you feel a true Talent through out this Disc."
1,Not a good solution for Mac,"I bought this critter to use with Skype and various chat programs on a bluetooth equipped Mac (IMac G5 running 10.3.9). It pairs well, and can be used once. Then the trouble starts. Attempting to use it from any application gives me ""Bluetooth Audio failed. There was an error connecting to your headset. Make sure it is turned on and in range. The audio portion of the program you were using may have to be restarted."" I suspect that feature of the headset which shuts itself off after a call is the culprit. I've contacted jabra support, to see if there is a way I can override it."
4,Riveting and Disturbing,"This is the heart wrenching story of the murder of Kim Anderson and her two children. Kim, a devout Jehovah's witness lost her life at the hands of her husband, also a member of that faith community. The story is told with courage and compassion by James Kosteliuk, her first husband and the father of the two children. While the trigger was pulled by Jeff Anderson, some blame must be laid at the doors of faith communities where religious principles come before the safety and well-being of its women and children. This book tells of a tragedy on many levels, but most importantly it reminds us of the violence that women and children continue to face in that safest of all places: their homes. Riveting and disturbing at the same time."
2,wolves among sheep,There just was not enough of a story for this small book withlots of padding. Poor.
5,Great E.P.,"This is a great EP with 2 originals and 2 covers. AFI covers: The Cure's song ""In the Hanging Garden"" which is one of the best Cure songs ever.They also cover Demonomania by the classic Misfits. Deffinately pick up this CD if you're into AFI, or want to be exposed to their music. (the first track on this CD: ""3 1/2"" is one of my favorite AFI songs.)"
4,Just buy it!,"AFI, What a band. This EP is well worth any money. The first 2 tracks are original AFI, fast, loud and energetic and also only available on this disc. Track 3 is a cover of The Cure's ""The Hanging Garden"". While for the forth, Davey Havock Pays respect to his hero 'Glenn Danzig', with Demonomania, origialy recorded by The Misfits. Simply put, Just buy it!"
3,Turning Point,The EP is notable in a few ways. It was the first release with Hunter as a full time member and the last with Mark on guitars. Black Sails came to be a new beginning but that seed definitely began to sprout with The Hanging Garden. It's a cover from The Cure and it is great at that.With only four songs and less than ten minutes of material it's hard to give it a high review. But it still deserves an honorable mention as a transition to something (in my opinion) better.
3,Before all the hype,"AFI has gone through some changes this is a much darker album and does not have the same pop appeal that the art of drowning or sing the sorrow yet the songs are fast and the covers are great especially hanging garden which is a great song to begin with but in AFI make it sound really dark. Demonamania is one of the worst Misfit songs, i wish they wouldve picked almost any other song from the misfit catalog."
2,"Getting better, but still not essential","Though a drastic improvement from ""Answer that and Stay Fashionable"" and ""Very Proud of Ya"", this still isn't particularly breathtaking or amazing.Of the four songs here, only their cover of the Cure's ""Hanging Garden"" is worth keeping, and that is played better on the ""Girls Not Grey"" on the vinyl single(availble at your nearest Hot Topic).SO though I doubt you will hit yourself for buying this record(as I did with the first two AFI ""records""), I also doubt that you will listen to it that often either. GO and buy the ""All Hallows E.P. intead."
5,Wonderful,Nice tie. A great combination for my husband who loves baseball and peanuts. Now if I would only learn how to tie it...
2,Book not intended for a novice,"I was disappointed in the quality of this book compared to other books on the market.The book is not in color and the layout is very difficult to use. The drawings don't contain the common names of the plants. It is not intended for a novice. If you are not a tree expert, and want to identify tress, I would recommend these tree books instead. ""Garden Trees"" by Richard Rosenfeld, ""Trees of North America"" by Roger Phillips, and the Smithsonian Handbook ""Trees"" by Allen J. Coombes."
3,Sadly overlooked chiller!,"Sondra Locke stars as Marguerite, a beautiful teenage girl who resides on a large, secluded country estate with her possessive mother (Mary Ure) and equally controlling grandmother (Signe Hasso). When her estranged father (Robert Shaw) reappears on the scene to ask for a divorce so that he can marry his girlfriend (Sally Kellerman), Marguerite develops a strong love for him and an obsessive hatred for her mother and grandmother, leading to a terrifying chain of violence and murder. Marvellously atmospheric thriller with good direction by former cinematographer William A. Fraker, an impressive early performance from Sondra Locke, and a twist ending that is sure to knock you right out of your seat."
5,Zoobombs are Super Funky Okay!,"The Zoobombs could be a novelty act - if they didn't ROCK SO HARD! It's the John Spencer Blues Explosion with a Japanese work ethic - play harder, hotter and tighter than anyone. You won't know what all of the lyrics mean (unless you speak Japanese), but you may still find yourself humming along and bobbing your head to the music."
3,Get the remaster with the bonus tunes instead,The best version of this album is the new one on Rhino Records so get that version instead. I really can't tell any difference in the quaility of this as opposed to the Rhino but the Rhino has many extra tunes.
4,The cheapest option to get Nokia N75,Too bad it's a two year commitment. I wish they had a cheaper plan and nokia n75 was more oriented on providing an easy way to communicate/operate rather than self-entertain. I found some phone functionality pretty dumb and not intuitive. They call it smart phone but i don't know about that... sometimes it thinks too long when i press a button. Reminds me an early era of computer technology when you were supposed to slap the monitor to make it work faster. I'm very happy though to have a 3G phone because connection quality is remarkable. This is what i purchased this phone for.
3,Very Interesting Concept but Too Long,"This book starts as an entertaining page turner, but it gets tedious. It is frankly too long for the subject matter. It is imaginative, sometimes novel, and the characters are well thought through, but as a children's book, I have to wonder how many of its intended audience will turn the 637th (reasonably cramped) page."
4,a relatively in-depth compendium into cinema history...,"the book is structured in a straight-foward manner. with it's frame-of-reference established from the very beginning, this text then progresses forward film-by-film in Kurosawa's career, and much of japanese cinema history and general japanese history. where this text adds and others deny is its dedication to pick at each film and argue and stress points, utilizing examples from films in a relativley-in-depth manner. Kurosawa's films are contextualized not only from humanities-type critique, but from literary and cinema theory, as well as an admirable effort into the muddled language of post-structuralism, etc. however, there are some disappointments when some films aren't covered heavily as compared to others, but this was probably to save on redundancy. This book is a necessary for those not familiar with Kurosawa's works and desire an extensive analysis, and it can also act as a good springboard into general literary and cinema theory."
3,A very ambitious tytle for this book,"The book deals mainly with the 1930s houses in England, not specially noted for Art Deco. Many of the popular market interpretations of the Art Deco style in the UK at that time were and are somewhat ""kitsch"", and the book reproduces them in full colour.There are few decorative elements of the 1920s, non-English, that are worth while. The photography is good, as is the printing, the weak point is on the examples shown. Reading the bibliography gives a clue to the contents."
2,More a historical reference book than a decorating book,"I ordered this book for a friend who has an Art Deco house and is planning an extension with a new kitchen. It sounded ideal but proved less than useful. It is really a historical reference for Art Deco elements which may be interesting to some but is not so useful if you want to use your house in a more modern way. The average 1930's kitchen just does not cut it these days. This book showed original Art Deco kitchens but no new kitchens in Art Deco style. I would recommend this book to design students and ardent enthusiasts of the style but not to someone who is not so fanatical. There are better books for integrating old and new such as ""Old House, New Home: Stylish Modern Living In A Period Setting""."
3,Great product but pretty pricey,"I recently had surgery and have been using the product, it is good but just seems really pricey for the amount you get"
2,Decent but beware,"After using this brush for a few months, the silver paint coating on the brush starts to peel off and sometimes leaves pieces of it in your hair. As far as it being ionic, I can't really tell the difference between this brush and any other brush."
5,Lessons From a Guitar Legend,"What a treat -- sixty minutes of lessons from one of the greatest guitarists of all time. This DVD covers all of the essential licks for playing Only You Know and I Know; Look at You, Look at Me; You Shouldn't Have Took More Than You Gave; and We Just Disagree. Since guitar instruction doesn't seem to come natural to Mason, an emcee accompanies him, coaxing Dave for those nuggets of detail about each song. It's an arrangement that works well. Mason politely complies with every request to ""play that lick again"" or ""play it slowly."" In addition, the DVD includes clips of Mason and his band playing live in concert. If you're a guitar player and, in particular, a Dave Mason fan, you'll want to own this DVD."
2,The Lulu you loved as a child,"Only when I saw this DVD in a Shopko did I remember my old, worn-out VHS tape of Little Lulu I loved as a child. This DVD includes the only 8 episodes I am familiar with:Chick and Double ChickBargain CounterattackA Bout With a TroutLoose in a CabooseBored of EducationA Scout With the GoutMusical LuluThe Dog Show OffThe cartoons are great but the DVD will leave you wanting. Absolutely no extras and it comes in a paper sleeve. The picture and sound quality are not DVD quality. But if you are a Lulu fan, it's worth it to have these episodes at such a cheap price. I give it a two because the disc has nothing save the cartoons, but they're still great!"
2,"Startling, yet cliched...","The story is quick to capture one's attention, yet the drama soon turns to fluff in its abundance of super-natural occurances and extreme descriptions. Yes, it tries hard to come across as ""magical realism"" in the purest Latin American form; however, it eventually reads like cliched kiosk litterature. By the end of the novel I was simply tired of reading about those magnificent emerald eyes and pomegranate lips...The incestous plot could have been just as interesting without the parties being such captivating beauties and ""extreme"" in all their actions. Even the repetitious love-making scenes are described with the nuance of Danielle Steele...The story does include interesting elements of the struggle to be of South American origin living in the US, and the descriptions of the contrast between those who consider themselves ""exiles"" and those who remain ""Cuban-to-the-bone"" are colorful.Overall a quick, but ultimately unsatisfying read."
5,Great short story,"This book has the feeling of raw emotion pouring out on the page. It is short and so easy to read that the book flew past me and I felt I was watching a movie. I read heavy Joycian things and mindless mainstream as well, and this book slots more into the ""magical"" mindless mainstream, but in a very artistic way. And to top it off, it has a happy ending, which I was not expecting. Unfortunately for the real world, there is such a thing as genetics that would eventually make their life sad were they to have kids, but that is not the point of the book, so I chose to suspend that reality while enjoying the book."
4,This is a gift,"I haven't read this book. I bought it as a gift for my daughter, who loves South American literature. I arrived promptly and in good condition."
3,"Book looks professional, pictures look amature","This little book was put together beautifully except for the inside sigils and seals, which are the main focus of the book. They look slightly pixellated, not noticeable from a distance, but up close one can tell. The other copy of the Turiel Grimoire out there definitely has better quality text and layout, but this product at least looks like a book."
5,Loveable,"We read this book for book group. We thought it would be good because it wasn't too long. After we started to read it we couldn't stop reading. Because it was short and good, it left us with feeling in our heart and we wanted to find out what else would happen to them. The idea of cats having wings was strange but cool. Jane, the mother cat, lived behind a dumpster. She wanted her kittens to have a better life. She dreamt about flying away and this was how the kittens got there wings. To find out more, we recommend a ton that you read these awesome books."
5,Wonderful for your younger child.,If your kids love to read this is a great starter set for them. My 6 year old loves these easy to read books. They are somewhat long but have readable words.
5,A very exciting book,"This is a really funny book. It's also sad and scary and adventurous. I feel as though it's happening alll around me when I read it. The other Catwings books are really good, too. They are easy to read for five-year olds."
5,let your imagination fly!,"I've been reading this series to first graders for decades. Both boys and girls love it. It's not just an exciting series, it's heart rending. It teaches about kindness and friends and families supporting each other. I've enjoyed her adult fiction as well."
4,cute story,"I loved this book as a kid and still think it's a great, cute little story. The four winged kittens in this book grow up in the city but fly off in order to find some place better. The illustrations are lovely, and cat lovers will enjoy the story."
5,Catwings,"CatwingsIn the story Catwings Harriet, James, Thelma, Roger have to leave their home.When they were trying to find their now home Roger got hurt by an owl.I like Catwings because cats can fly. I like the story it's funny. One thing I learned was if cats have wings do not pull on them.If you were a cat and kids were grabbing you and pulling on your wings and you can't fly anymore. this would be a big problem for a catwing.This book is so good because cats can fly and the happy ending.When Roger is better two kids come and find the cats , feed them and take care of them."
3,SEARCHING FOR KIND HANDS,"This delightful tale of four winged felines is a read-in-one-sitting treat--great to read aloud as well. A sweet fantasy, CATWINGS relates the adventures of tabby siblings whose mother advised them to leave the city slums for their health--not to mention her second honeymoon... Whimsy and humor combine to create an enchanting piece, which reveals the similarities between two sympathetic (i.e. mutually dependent) species. Purrfect for kids under 10 and all cat lovers. Beats Puss in Boots paws down! It's the Cat's Whiskers--and now with Wings!"
4,Great introduction to kachina collecting!,"Nicely illustrated, this book gives a brief but complete introduction to Kachina figurines. I would have preferred to have the dolls be grouped a little differently than the book did but that is the only bad thing I can say about it. A very good reference work on this subject."
1,You are Warned!,"Word of Warning. I purchased a BenQ projector and had it for a month before it started to fail and turn itself off. I sent it to BenQ for repair and have not recieved it back. That was over two months ago. I phone them every couple of days and get only lip service, they keep saying it is coming. So before you purchase a BenQ product think about the possibility of it getting repaired...or should I say never seeing it again.You have been warned!"
1,I hope Amazon has 0 start option,"I confirm that this BenQ projector has either a crappy bulb or bad color wheel. I have used it for about 2 years, only watching movies on the weekends. The recorded bulb usage is 337 hours, and the picture already starts to flicker. At first I thought it might be the 25 feet long signal cable, so I disconnected the cable and just watched the blank blue screen, still flickers! Its promised bulb time is 2000 hours in video mode. If it is only me, I can blame it on probability and statistics. But it does not seem so.I have not yet called BenQ, but since I have used it for two years (I have to check the warranty), and people here already complained about their bad support, I don't have high hope on it. The best thing you can do is not to buy it."
2,Screw you on the Bulb,"Low-budget home theatre owner here. Was happy with my unit. Pretty nice picture on a blank white wall. I have a dedicated cinema room that is pitch black so was very happy...until one hour ago. After 300 hours of use my bulb blew. And I never watch more than 2-3 hours at a time, so definitely not a high traffic user. I'm all the way in Hungary and that bulb is about a month's wages for this school teacher. This is a shoddy product, built-in obsolesence to the extreme. Now I have a useless room with a BenQ wart on the ceiling!"
1,Item not as described.,"This item came well packaged, but had obviously been opened before. It was covered with a sticky substance, almost like it had tape all over it. It was very dirty & tarnished. I have another of this exact light that has hung in my hall bath for 6 years & it is in much better condition than this ""new"" one. If you are looking to match the two, there is a slight difference in weight & design. I don't know about the shades, because I packaged it right back up after seeing the condition of the fixture."
5,Excellent!.,"This book was in excellent shape. I couldn't believe it was used! I received it before anticipated! All in all, a great shopping experience."
4,I Highly recommend this book !,"I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to build a dollhouse from scratch. I have built three dollhouses from kits and want to try one from scratch in the future. this is the ONLY dollhouse construction book I found that gives plans for dollhouses of a reasonable size. All of the other books provide plans for dollhouses that are, in my opinion, too large. I construct dollhouses that a mother can pick up and move from room to room so the child can play with it or place it upon a dresser at night. This makes it a practical size for either a house or apartment.The color schemes used on the dollhouses on the cover are ho-hum. Keep in mind that you can paint your dollhouse whatever colors you like. There are probably a few examples of houses in your area that would be excellent models."
5,cats love it,"my cats have loved this, so much I got a second one. Nelson sleeps on top of the cube and also goes up there to get away from his baby brother, Chance. Stevie sleeps in the lower level. For $20 it's a good kitty condo. I'd pay more for bigger squares. My cats fill the hammocks and then some. A couple inches bigger and it'd be perfect."
3,Its allright,"Easy to put together. cats kinda like it.. the only thing i don't like about it, is that its like a plastic nylon material.. it definitely should have been made out of canvas..."
5,Nice and easy,"It was very easy to assemble, did it under 10 minutes. The construction is light weight but for my cat 10lbs it's just fine. The vinyl is sturdy and the little mice have already been hours of entertainment. For the price, this is really a nice gym. I like being able to move it, especially when company comes over."
4,It took a while...,"After a week of sitting in the living room corner ignored (the box it came in was more fun) I moved this to my bedroom where the cats hang out more often and that's when it started to become fun. They sleep on it, hide in it and do other cat like things. I've had to pop some of the joints back together from more vigorous playtimes but for the price it's quite good. I wish this company would design a taller, studier version since putting it together was a snap and it was so cheap."
4,Like kids throwing a hissy-fit,"Beep Beep just might be the most intense and sporadic album to ever come from the Saddle Creek family. The greatest thing about it is that BUSINESS CASUAL continually surprises the listener track after track. It'll make you want to dance... but not the kind of dancing you do in a club, trying to get the pretty brunette in the corner to notice you, it's the seizure-like aneurysm that shakes you from your brain to your toes. Drawing from the likes of XTC, Gang of Four, and Sparks, Beep Beep achieves a sound similar to modern bands like The Faint and The Rapture...on speed and ecstasy that is. Electrifying and perverse, it's the next album you're going to buy."
4,holy crap! seizure in a box.,"sounds like... nothing that i have ever heard before. this is the kind of music that you dance (read ""shake furiously and sporadically"") to in your bedroom with the volume on 10. if you like early Q and not U, you will probably like ""Business Casual"". it is kind of like if ""No Kill, No Beep Beep"" was made while on speed. oh no!, misuse their bodies, and the flourescent lights are my favorite tracks on the cd. alot of the lyrics on this cd are sexually driven. great cd but not the best that i have heard, hence the 4 stars out of 5."
4,Well-rounded lesbian media survey,"This collection of critical essays dealing with the portrayal of lesbians in movies, theatre and books is intelligent and quick-witted, with a nice balance of critical styles. Of special note is Mary Wings' rereading of the DuMaurier story, ""Rebecca"". My only complaint is that the book tends to be a bit Brit-centric in places, especially when in the sections on theatre and short film. Overall however, well worth the time to read, and a great addition to any student of the genre."
3,A classical Zouk Cd,"This old record is one of the most classical Zouk discs that originated todays Zouk love, Beton and Compas. Its nice to listen, specially 2nd track Djoni, but its clearly out of date. Although its surely Kassav s best record."
2,not as good as I'd hoped,"UAMC starts out fast and funny. It has some wonderful humor, great snappy dialogue and interesting main characters. I wasreading along, happy as a clam until I hit the last half of the book. Then all ofa sudden, the heroine turns into a stupid idiot, the ex-cop turned PI herodoes some stupid things himself, I was a bit stunned at how out of the bluethe villain was and I really didn't care how the story turned out anymore.Plus the author hurls the h/h into bed very suddenly (the book is only 211pages long) and the heroine takes forever to figure out what a slime bag,industrial waste polluted pond scum sucking jerk her fiance is. Whatstarted out so promising limped to a finish with a C- from me."
3,Fun to see once,"I ordered this tape because I read about it in Alan Alda's autobiography, and wanted to see the movie. It was only so-so, but fun to see once."
2,It sucks,"This is a boring type-cast story that leaves you feeling like ""so, why did I have to watch that ?"" Depressing, with no entertainment value, not to mention it's very dated. When Alan Alda was a movie star, the world was a much different place than it is now. Maybe, that's why the movie doesn't ring true. Anyway, I don't recommend it."
3,X-files the Game,Good idea but it took too long for the game to read from the CD and so action sequences were painful.
3,works well until it crashes.....often.,"I find that Anonymizer doesn't slow down the Internet connection too much, but that it crashes often."
5,The best Gospel hip-hop album nobody's ever heard of,"I've never heard anything quite like this Southern white-boy offering, produced by the one and only brilliant Toby Mac. It's extremely laid back, goes far out of it's way to paint a picture of their Southern roots while delivering some BANGING tracks. As simple as an offering it is, somehow it has meandered its way into status as one of my favorite records."
5,The Poignancy and Joy of Motherhood - A Literary Connection Between All Mommies,"Julie Watson Smith has captured something very real in this book: the need for mothers - from all walks of life - to find something that unites us all. We're not alone on this journey, and we ought to delight in the chaos. Even on our worst days, (this book addresses those bad days, too) motherhood is a gift, and this is celebrated on every page. A wonderful book, like a warm cup of tea for the mommies collective soul."
2,Celia,"A Large number of typo errors in this book - letters missing from words, words run into one another - which makes it difficult to read.I have noticed this in a number of Ruth Rendell books I have bought from Amazon and will not buy any more unless I can be sure that this has been corrected."
4,NC Counties 1663 - 1943,I ordered as a Christmas gift for my spouse. I ordered it it in what I believed was adquete time for arrival beore Christmas. It didn't make it. I was warned that it might be late and that I might want to choose a faster method of shipment but I did not. The shiper placed it in the mail almost immediatly upon order so I believe the problem was with the USPS. My wife is happy with the book. It is exactly as described and it came wrapped well so no damage was incurred in shipping. I would use this source again and would recommend them. They followed up with emails to ensure our satisfaction.The Formation of the North Carolina Counties 1663 to 1943
5,John Lilly for President!,"Boy, would that change things a bit! Dr. Lilly is an authority on some far-our stuff: dolphin communication, isolation tanks, and Ketamine. Mix them all together and what do you get? I don't know, but I wouldn't lend it my car. GREAT BOOK."
4,An intriguing biography,"An intriguing biography of Lilly's work in animal communication, brain research and flotation tanks.Much of his work is valuable and continues today in the form of NLP, meta states and human mentaldevelopment."
1,FAR OUT,"Lilly lived close to my house in his final days and I read this book with particular interest. I was very disappointed. He seems to evince very little knowledge of modern parapsychology eg out of body experiences (a la Monroe) and his own ""travels"" and ""contacts"" seem to me implausible and more likely the outpourings of a deranged or drugged imagination than science. In all such areas the question of standards of evidence is key. I am not sure Lilly gave the matter any thought."
5,An Awsome Gun!!,"If you get the FLASH FLOOD, then you are wasteing money. It is to heavy and non-portalble.But if you get the Arctic Shock,you're getting a 2.60 lbs. pistol.GET THIS GUN.....IT ROCKS IN WATER FIGHTS!!!!!!!!!!!!Uses:Sniping,soaking,etc. if youre doing water balloons vs.gun youll win!"
1,Not the quality you'd expect,"I purchased this Super Soaker for my younger brother about one year ago. Unfortunately, it wasn't long after purchase that it stopped working. According to my younger brother, while playing with it one afternoon it just stopped working! He said that he pressurized it with the pump as usual and pulled the trigger but absolutely no water came out. I later tried to see if I could get it to fire myself, but the same thing happened. Needless to say I was very disappointed about this because after all, this is a very expensive toy and should have been built to much higher quality standards by this ""name brand."" Even while it was working though, I did notice that the spray was not terribly strong and as a result had a limited range which is another thing to keep in mind."
5,Best of My Guns Yet,this was overall the best super soaker i have ever purchased. i bought one in 05' and i bought one 3 days ago in that kit.. the gun has good range and a good capacity. this is an awesome first gun and is nice compared to any gun available.also look at:Super Soaker Artic Shock Blaster with XP215 Blaster and Aqua PackSuper Soaker Aqua Shock Sneak Attack
5,The songs are new every time!,"Smooth flowing lyrics, tight harmonies, and a great eternal message! Seven thumbs up!"
5,"Fantastic music/lyrics, with an awesome message!","This CD happened to be the first Out of Eden CD that I have purchased. The entire disc has a fabulous mix of music that relates to Christian life. What a tribute to these three artists! BTW, they happen to have an incredible sound...sort of like a cross between Wilson Philips and SWV (aka, Sisters With Vocies). It is a MUST BUY for your music library!!"
4,My current favorite.,"I like the different music styles (some sound a little like disco or 70's throw back, etc.) I like the harmonies also but maybe ONE song with a solo would be a refreshing change."
2,Old,"I love OOE, but the music on this CD is old and out of date. I would reccomend Love, peace, & happiness or No turning back by them instead to get an idea of what their music is like nowadays."
1,COOL GROOVES,Out Of Eden is one of my fav bands.I like its cool grooves and the sistas can really sing in harmony.The best thing about them is that they are christian.
4,Safari toy in the sky toob,The toys in the toob were fun for my child. Happy with toys but I think its over price once I saw it in person. Its great for kids just not price right.
2,WAY TOO SMALL,"I bought these b/c my 2 year old is obsessed with planes and it is hard to find a good variety of planes. When I saw this tube, I was excited b/c it has a great assorment of air transportation. They are cute, however the size is so small. Smaller than a half dollar or maybe the size of about 2 or 3 jacks. They are about 1/2 size of a matchbox car. I am very dissapointed about this. This toob had great potential. I guess they will make good bath toys for my child."
1,terrible,I bought this movie by accident. I thought this was another movie with the same title that I saw on cable televion. I started watching this movie as soon as I received it and shut the TV off in less than 5 minutes. The actor mouths weren't moving with the sound. Very amateur actors. Looked like a soap opera.
1,Horrible!,This movie makes even B-movies look bad. The cinematography gave me a headache. The editing and shots are poorly pasted together into a mishmash of scenes. The plot makes no sense with unnecessary nudity. Do NOT buy or watch this movie unless you're a fan of one of the actors in it.
2,Peter's Performance is solid... Story is not.,"Peter plays a down and out playright that tries to get a play back in the limelight after 15 long years. Kay Taggert was the lead role in the origial play but died on the opening night. Peter's performance shines as Sol Bonsky... As the story goes on.. his character tries to get his play out there again with a new face as the lead, but accidents start happening when rehersals get underway.Enter a man wanting to investigate ghosts when claims when there are sitings of Key Taggert's ghost. This film will keep you guessing from start to finish.There is a sex scene in this that does not add to the story... Do not watch this unless you are a fan of Peter.. it is too bad that he didn't get a better project then this... He really was good in spite of the quality of the sound, story, and some of the actors he worked with..."
4,Different from anything I've ever heard,"I'd recommend that you begin listening with tracks 13 and 21, which effectively deconstruct the tough-guy, angst-ridden attitude that they try to start out with in the first few tracks. There aren't many tracks I'd cut out of this album; almost all of them have some redeeming musical and/or political point to make."
2,Old News,This card was revolutionary when it came out. However the card died when the company was purchased by Nvidia and not many games support it anymore. Worse yet nvidia is now incorporating the aquired technology into their new graphics card. Save you money and just but a new 200 series card from nvida that includes aegias technogology built in.At this point in time this card is an outdated technology that is nearly dead and would be a complete waste of money.
3,Great Card,"Very good for physics for graphically intense applications, this card will take a load of the CPU. But somehow when I bought it, it had no Vista drivers, and buggy to program with. Maybe drivers now are changed. Got it because it was for $300 awhile ago. so this was a good deal for me really."
2,They were so good together!,"The whole storyline was pretty... , but Matt seemed like such a sweet guy! I mean, in the blurb it goes "" Nicoles met her Mr Right""! Oh and there was that really cute bit where she described how they kissed, how sexy was that?!?!One really bad thing about the book was all the rascist comments. It doesn't matter if she follows it up by saying "" I'm not a rascist"". Doesn't she realize how stupid it sounds?"
1,Thoroughly unenjoyable author,"Julie Burchill is one of the most least informed, arrogant and unprofessional columnists and authors in this world. Her character is utterly sadistic and shows signs of manic depression. Her comments on how bad other people look are so ridiculous when you consider the fact that her appearance resembles that of an over-weight and hairy Greek prostitue."
4,Corsican Brothers,It was a very good movie and took us back to the old days. Pictures were nice and clear. I played it on my Blue Ray and the sound came out very good.
4,"Fun, but not especially informative","However, this video is worth watching. Do like I did, though: borrow it from your local library. It's not quite good enough to purchase."
5,Accidents don't have to happen,"I checked this out from a library. I found it so useful that I bought a copy for my 89-year-old mother to keep at her house and for my siblings to review when we visit. It has great sections on how to handle stairs for those who are not sure-footed, for dealing with ice (difficult for anyone to maneuver), for how to fall if you cannot avoid it, exercises for strengthening muscles, and much more. Every public library, at least, should have this, and probably every household with babyboomers or older."
3,Elementary reminders that help.,"The book is a good start; it has helped me realize what is required, and where to look for more."
3,I like Foley. Having said this...,"I had a few problems with this album. I had my heart set on hearing Foley shred on the bass, but it didn't happen much. Over all, the album has a VERY early 90's feel. It will take you back, then it will get annoying. But he does rip into ""Black dog"" and ""The Senate"". These tracks are REDICULOUS!!!Miles Davis - Live in MunichAmandla"
5,Great herb. My favorite for coughs,"Since moving to Florida from Washington state seven months ago, my children have been getting sick quite often as they get used to their new environment. Elecampane has eased the symptoms in my two-year old, who usually gets sick first, and as soon as I see her getting sick I give it to my four-year old as well, and if she does get sick it's very minor. Before this herb, they would both be sick for weeks. Now I give them this, along with slippery elm, and some others, 3 times daily and they are better in a snap. I very highly recommend this for coughs, colds, sore throats, etc."
4,Lili Taylor is reason enough to see this film,"This somewhat flawed coming of age film is remarkable for the performance of Lili Taylor as Lucy, a world-weary young woman out to save her brother from jail. Richard Ford has written some wonderful dialogue for her character but to appreciate it you have to see her delivery. Wonderful cast includes Sam Shepherd, Mary Kay Place, Valerie Perrine and Bill Pulliam. Score is original and interesting."
2,"Nice scenery, bad script","Set in the desolate expanses of working-class and sub-criminal Montana and Oklahoma, it's a kinda-sorta coming of age story where characters wander through the plot without any particular purpose and things just seem to happen without any particular reason.That's great in real life--people do tend to wander aimlessly in and out of each other's lives and things do just sort of happen without any discernable pattern--but it makes for a bad movie. The only real drama of the film happens about 3/4ths of the way through it... and it's way too brief.Lili Taylor and Bill Pullman give nice performances (which is why the flick gets two stars instead of one), but there's not much else worthwhile here. Pass on this one unless you're the world's greatest Lili Taylor fan or don't have anything else to spend the $8 on."
2,After-taste,"This is the first time I've used Stevia so I don't know how it compares to other Stevia products. I was looking for a sugar substitute and this had an after-taste. It reminds me of the after-taste of splenda, subtle but definitely an after-taste. If you're ok with Splenda, you would probably be ok with Stevia. What I've heard is that not all Stevia products are the same. I bought Stevia NOW because I use their vitamins, like their brand but don't like this Stevia product."
5,Snowballs is truly a classic!,Such a cute and artistic book! It is engaging and the illustrations are incredible! So thrilled to add this to my classroom library!
4,Snowballs,"If you are a Lois Ehlert fan, you KNOW she has outstanding pictures, as well as meaningful content. How could you go wrong? Perfect for the young & ""young at heart."" Ages preschool-7 will enjoy this treasure."
1,Snowballs review,I was very upset when I recieved this book. It is missing an entire page which makes it absolutely useless to me.
4,A wonderful children's picture book.,"The masterful use of vivid colors and an interesting theme in Snowballs will surely draw any child's attention. The following everyday items: coffee beans, bottle caps, foil candy wrappers, and corn are all used to colorfully illustrate the components of a more realistic snow family. The picture book will inspire your children to go outside and make a snow person, instead of plopping down in front of the old TV."
5,Excellent Inexpensive Secuirty system,"I started out w/ 4.0 version several years ago, and have moved up to 5.0. The Amazon price is better than what I paid - Easy to install; I have a video camera (this does up to 3 camera's at one time) in the window of my home looking out over the front yard, and 1.5 tb connected to my computer to save the files. There is an option to set up a port / ip address to see offsite via the internet. You can set up timers of when to record. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!There are more features, such as e-mailing a file when motion is detected but I have not used it."
3,Nice pictures but we found it needing,"We still enjoy the ""Joy of Sex"" better, although I do like the natural pictures in this book. It provides good ideas for younger persons but less likely for seasoned couples."
4,MORE UNDER THE COVERS,"I've read of number of sex books and this one, while not the best, is certainly worth looking at. The pictures are really helpful in trying out new positions and I really enjoyed the section on romantic food. ...."
1,Way to simple,"This book has absolutely no substance behind it. It's extremely simple and gives no depth to any topic. If you have the internet, or a library card for that matter, then you can find more information in less than 5 minutes. This book might help a complete virgin, who never took a sex ed class (well... maybe it'd help those that took an abstinance only class, too) but not anyone else. Don't waste your money."
5,Very informative!,"I thought I new everything about sex...but I found out otherwise from this book. I would totally recommend this book to anyone that is interested in learning more. The pictures are helpful in describing positions,etc."
2,Lo-Fidelity,"Sounds like it was mixed for a 2-inch tv speaker. It's all mids here. No high or low frequency extension. No dynamic range either. Nothing is loud or soft, just squished. It is Ray Charles so I couldn't bring myself to give this disc just one star but I was tempted."
1,refund please!!! awful.,"Very FEW of the classics you'll remember, and lots of high brow orchestra limiting Ray and his magical voice. The sound seemed really low quality, we've got an incredible sound system and it sounded like AM Radio at points. Whenever he spoke to the crowd or the orchestra, you couldn't hear his voice."
1,Don't waste your money on this,"I bought one of these and it was a total waste of money. It printed about 5 pages successfully and then the printer said there was a problem with the cartridge. Resetting, etc did not help and I had to give up."
3,nice twist at the end- unless I misinterpret,"I've seen parts of this now a couple of times and just caught the ending. It's actually an okay movie and if I'm not wrong, the last scene there seems to indicate the none of the events actually happened. The guy was never kicked out of his house .. never in the apartment living with the two girls and ""writing about writing"" etc.Instead, he and his wife are happy at home, and the entire movie has been the guy sleeping on his own couch to come up with the ideas for everything we've seen in the movie up until the last minute or so when he returns to bed and has that last conversation with his wife.So in effect, he's been writing about a guy who is kicked out of his house and forced to live with two girls where he writes about them, writing about him. Or something like that !!!Anyone else get that impression ? Kind of a clever end that way."
5,Kismet great musical,"Kismet is a lesser-known musical with great music, Arabian swing, best voices, very entertaining.""Not Since Nineva..?"" swinging instrumental that more bands should play.""Bubbles, Bangles, & Beads"" a hit, some songs from the classics."
4,German version,"Like the previous reviewer I also received a version in German with a different track listing. I was looking for the English version with the track listing displayed on Amazon. The German version is also good, but because of the language I give it only four stars. I'm sure I would give five stars for the English version. Ramona is one of my favourite songs, and I think The Blue Diamonds' version is one of the best, so I would like to have especially this song in English."
2,Different languages (version)?? Ratings are on product info. only.,"If the previous reviewer received his copy in the Spanish language, I received mine in German!! The identical product images and title seen but with entirely different track listings; only 2 songs are of same titles, ""Ramona"" & ""Sukiyaki"". Are there different versions in different languages available on this product or is it Amazon's track listings that is incorrect? Also, as the previous reviewer has stated, sound quality of CD is good thus my disappointment and dissatisfaction is strictly on the review of its content's discrepancy."
2,spanish,"My favorite song, ""Sukiaki"", is in Spanish and I was looking for theEnglish version. In fact, I believe all the songs are in Spanish.However, the quality is good, and the package arrived in good shapeand in good time."
1,Touched--,"Awful, awful, awful. Slow drama that tries to be a tear jerker! The only crying I wanted to do was that I bought it to watch! The acting is atrocious and the story line is just plain stupid! I can't recommend this movie to anyone.A nurse who has had a hard life gets involved with one of her patients after he wakes from his coma of several years. He has a hard time living in the present and especially with out his son who was killed in the same auto accident that caused him to be in coma. Really, the story takes a downward turn as soon as he comes from coma and never gets any better."
4,Very sweet....,"Sure, there's some Hollywood-ness to this movie. The whole waking-up-from-a-coma topic is improbable at best, but it's also of a theme that all of us hope and dream for, and presented quite effectively by a very attractive cast. Nice chemistry between Elfman and Batinkoff, too.My boyfriend was in a horrendous accident and in a coma for 3 days before awakening, not nearly so dramatically as portrayed in this movie, but just as emotionally, so I have a certain affinity for what these characters go through.It's a lovely and well meaning little movie with flawed and imperfect characters and a message of love and hope."
3,Jenna Elfman is a cutie,"My wife rented this movie tonight, and from the cover I had second thoughts. But then, I have had my pick of bad movies from time to time. I wouldn't say it was a bad movie, but I agree with the other reviewers that it was slow, sad and very dark (people just refused to turn on the light on this movie).I've always found Jenna Elfman to be a cutie, so it was well worth the 90 minutes. Mr Batinkoff is good looking and the acting was very good in my opinion. The music was also very good. Being a father of a three year old boy, who I love unconditionally, I could easily relate as to how a father would feel having lost his son.For a slow night, I think this movie is worth the rental. If anyone is to blame, it could be the director, for not advancing the plot faster and by choosing a ""low light"" ambiance to the movie."
5,A Great Discovery,"Perfect Love, a breakthrough in relationships thinking, uncovers a profound secret of lasting romance in today's New Reality consciousness. Like all great discoveries, this one seems stunningly obvious once someone points it out. By seeing and appreciating the spiritual essence of your partner, your entire relationship is raised to a higher level, one where true romance becomes a living reality. This landmark book is filled with brilliant insights which show you exactly how, once and for all, to bring the joy of deep romance into your own life.Owen Waters, author of ""The Shift: The Revolution in Human Consciousness."""
2,"This is good for Gospel Music,","This project is very good for gospel. The message is good, but cosmetically the flow and the music is wack. Why dose gospel have to be two and three years behind secula? Why can't we be trailblazers and make them sample us not the other way around. GRITS I'm not hatin on you, I just want you to represent my savior like he should be. He is the best thing to ever happen to the world so the music should reflect that. Look out for TRIUMPH records to revolutionize gospel and the world."
3,"Mellow, neuvo-artsy hip-hop with a Jazz Flava...","This is a mix between Da-La-Soul, Arrested Development, & a water downed Fugees/Roots. This music seems to be targeted more toward a contemporary gospel audience vs. a hip-hop audience. There are a couple of clever lines/rhymes and hooks (like a track #10 reference to their 'white-boy' DJ being able to rock a party and then a segue into an 80's hip-hop drum beat), but it's not consistent. Lyrically, this is very 80s-ish (Did someone say Sugar Hill Gang?). They even use 80s rap jargon like `Debonair'. The tracks are semi-mellow, w/a muffled bass drum and too much lead guitar."
1,You have to be joking,"If you want good Christian rap check out Gospel Gangstaz/Gang Affiliated...of course, I'm partial to West Coast (Dre, Warren G, et. al), so maybe if you're into East Coast you'll dig this. Otherwise, I found this to be very dull. Cliche rhymes with predictive beats. I don't know, maybe it's just me."
5,They're tight,Grits is a great Christian Rap group. I like them because they deal with more than just spiritual warfare like other Christian Rap groups. They speak the Word of God straight up. They don't make it warm and fuzzy. They are downright tight.
3,Not the best of Grits but still fun to listen to,"I gave the album 3 stars just because I have all of Grits cds and this is my least favorite. Not to say I don't like it though. Grits was still coming along nicely with this 2md album of theirs and it seems that they overdid it a bit with the same sort of beats on many of the songs. Some of the songs are rather talkish too. The ones that stand out though for me are #13 Gospel Rap; Parables (look out for Knowdaverbs, does nice job) and #17 Blame It On You which goes on for quite awhile but it has a nice beat to it. Good album if you're a Grits fan and just want to groove to them but not good for a first time listener. Check out Dichotomy A or Grammatical Revolution instead for their best work (in my opinion)."
4,Good for what it is,"The CD is good for what it is. When you look at message and flow, I agree that Gospel Gangstaz are the tightest in the industry, but this CD was definately better than the first album and I personally believe the it was better than the one after it. It's good for what it is."
1,Very poor source of dietary information.,"These people have stumbled upon the truth (carbs make you fat and contribute to poor health), but they cannot wean themselves from years and years of mainstream dietary misinformation. So, for instance, they still publish the ""food pyramid"" with a base of six servings of carbohydrates. They state that a food with a glycemic index of 70 or more is ""high."" That is really high! Yet they recommend graham crackers as a snack for children (G.I. of 74). This book is confusing and poorly written."
1,too detailed,"A few of these little story riddles are cute enough to remember, but the rest are way too long and detailed. The result is that the kids don't know which detail to use to remember the solution. Not worth buying!"
3,Product is OK...not great,"While the Vidal Sassoon Ionic Thermal All Purpose Brush is great for keeping my ends from curling up, if I use it on the rest of my hair, I get flyaway hair. This brush causes static in my hair, I don't feel that I get the shine and quick drying that was described."
4,This brush is great,Yes yes yes. This brush rocks. I love the way it feels in my hands. And it a great brush for all my needs.
4,Another brush,"*Shrugs* Seems like most other brushes to me. I gave it 4 stars because it is a nice brush, but not 5 because I don't see any difference in it from any other cheap brush you'd get at the store."
2,falling apart...,sometimes i try to do reviews as soon as i get the product but in this case i am happy i waited a while.in the beginning i was definitely going to say this is a 5 star brush.it was sturdy in my hand and managed my bouncy thick hair without too much fussing so instead of just using it to blow dry my hair i made it my number one brush and pushed aside all my other combs.now only a few short months later i wish i knew where my combs got to :(i have not used this brush 10 times to blow dry my hair and now almost 90% of the bristles have lost the tips-making it a pain to use.i wish i can find a better everyday long lasting brush.
2,Brush doesn't last,"This brush was amazing when it was new, but after a few months of using it the rounded tips started coming off the individual bristles leaving behind bristles that scratch your scalp."
3,Fine in the beginning but doesn't last,This brush worked well when I got it but after not too long the little balls at the end of the bristles started coming off leaving sharp bristles that hurt your scalp. Definitely not made to last.
5,Who Buys a Six Dollar Brush? I Do!,"In my search for better hair I have purchased more and more expensive shampoos, conditioners and styling products. God forbid the hairdressing shop have a new product in that I don't have also on my shelves.When my old hairdryer died I happily purchased another one from Amazon, this brush was a tag-a-long product and cost almost nothing. What is another six dollars in the quest for good hair? Well, I love this brush. It does not tangle wet or dry hair, does not frizz my dry hair when I use it, and helps style when I blow dry.The best six dollar investment in styling tools that I have ever made.Also highly recommend my new dryerConair 225RX 1875 Watt Comfort Touch Tourmaline Ceramic Styling Dryer, BlackHappy Styling!"
4,Good product,"This brush does an effective job of stimulating the scalp and brushing the hair, without breaking the hair. I've never used it when blow-drying my hair -- my hair's long and I like to use a brush with a large diameter, to keep the hair straighter -- but my guess is that it would work very well with shorter hair."
4,Very good product,"I have black nappy hair and this brush is very good on it, especially after i spray my hair with oil and water. It smooths my hair. However it looks like the tips of the brush start sticking on my hair after a while"
5,Great!,Love this brush - gentle on hair when it is wet or dry. Would strongly recommend it - especially with longer hair
5,Great Brush Great Value,"What M. Wolf said in her review is exactly on point.I'm here to give my 5 stars review because I wholeheartedly agree. I really like the weight and the material it was made from. The price is a great value at $6.58, I would buy another one again. Highly recommended!"
3,So fragile,"The first month I feel I finally find the right comb, but soon I know I'm too optimistic.The end of the teeth of the comb is little round balls, they are so fragile that after one month use they are all gone!Now the teeth of the comb just scrape my skalp and it hurts.Don't waste your money. Find sth better."
4,As Advertised,"I cannot comment on the reduced drying time of hair when using this brush, but I can say that it does its job.The bristles are spaced far enough apart to lift the hair, but close enough to style it in whatever fashion you choose.Quality parts, a nice heft to it, and finger indentations on either side for a better grip on the handle."
4,This is a new model brush. Still good.,"I ordered this brush again after those little ball tips falling off on the old model of this brush, which I used about 2 years. At least the news Nodel ( I ordered dec 2012), donot have the separate ball tips anymore. The ball and the bristle is one piece. Overall the look & feel is different than the original brush. It still feels pretty good, with good substance. It's a good everyday brush. I haven't seen functionally any difference yet."
5,It works,It really works as described. My girl really says that it removes knots in her hair effortlessly. Its not she has bad hair but its way better than other brushes.
3,Melted by Hairdryer,"This was a great brush, as long as you don't use it while blow drying your hair. The bristles literally melted during the first few uses with my blowdryer and they are so deformed it's hard to use as a brush now."
5,As profound and moving as his films,"Devotional Cinema is a how-to book for the soul of filmmaking. Would be appreciated by anyone who loves film, makes film, cares about film as an artform. A prose poem on the act of seeing and making."
5,friends & lovers - gloria loring,this song was popular during the mid 1980s when the artist also appeared on soap days of our lives. the producers incorporated the song and a video-soap style for the show and used at the time a sneaky way to exit the actress off the show by saying she was going on tour. very touching song.
2,Ozarks Adventure Story,"Little Town in the Ozarks is the fifth book in a series about Laura Ingalls Wilder&#65533;s daughter Rose. Rose has many fun, exciting, and scary adventures, such as getting Pneumonia and rolling down a hill in a barrel.One of my favorite characters, is Nate who lives on a farm with his older brother, Abe, Abe&#65533;s wife, Effie, and Effie&#65533;s twin babies, James and Elza. I like him because he is nice , like when Rose gets sick, he comes to see her a lot.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read about 12 year old girls who have lots of adventures and who love to read. One adventure is when a tree falls on their henhouse, after a big ice storm, and makes a big hole that the chickens escape out of, and then they have to find all of the hens and roosters."
5,Two Thumbs Up!!!,The Laura Ingalls Wilder Series is Great! The Rose books are really good.This one is great because it keeps you interested and has many good points Keep Reading!!! (I really do wish that the family chain could have continued after Rose.)
4,halloween must have,"So far I have only had a chance to look through a few sections, but I can tell already that this book is going to so very helpful this Halloween season. I do a yard haunt, and each year I am looking for something new to ad to the display and this book is already inspiring to go bigger and better than I had originally planned. It's easy to read and follow the instructions. A must have for Halloween haunters of all calibers"
4,The Old Movies,"For anyone who likes old movies, made in the early 50's etc this is for you. Jack Palance is fabulous along with the other stars, Ida Lupino, Rod Steiger, Shelley Winters. The story is believable and although it is in black and white it lacks for nothing. I was not dissappointed."
2,Overwrought & Overwritten,"The Big Knife is Clifford Odet's tale from the dark side of Hollywood, clumsily adapted from his stage play about a mega star yearning to break free from the the studio yoke. Most of the supporting cast offer fairly low-key performances while the major players seem miscast, especially Jack Palance. He's a fine actor but tries to keep his part interesting by relentlessly mugging, exercising and sweating his way around the set. I'm not suggesting that you don't watch this curiosity...by all means, you need to see it just for the sheer pleasure watching Rod Steiger's scenery-chewing movie mogul. His odd vocal cadence and fevered histrionics became a staple for any comedian doing impressions in the 60's."
5,opinion,"my opinion is that its one of the greatest album to come out to this day ,and he dont even get reconizized for it . i,m talking about off the the chain."
2,repeat buyer,I have orderd so many of these plugs- i could have bought 2 new coffee pots already! they dont last long- after only a few uses they start to smell - an electrical smell and than soon after I have to throw them away cause they get very hot- after this next batch I will spend the extra money and get the cord that is made for my coffee pot and see if that works better- for the price I would give this plug 5 stars- if I was using it for something other than my coffee pot- I am sure it would last alot longer- I think it something with the coffee pot not the plug
3,"It's nice, but...","Some of the names of the hieroglyphs are wrong. Some of the mytholigies are wrong too, like the one about Isis and the seven scorpions. She doesn't even go into the importance of Ancient Egyptian numerology very well. And at times it seems like the book is ""talking a lot, but not saying anything"".Great if you like ancient egyptian stuff and aren't too dogmatic about Egyptian mythology and whatnot, but if you are going to use it for reading, I suggest researching Ancient Egyptian Numerology and hieroglyphs first."
3,Promises a lot but fails to deliver,"This particular book of Morrell starts off on a high note, has a reasonable build-up but fails to deliver the knock-out punch. The book like any other book of Morrell is exciting, but somehow all the anticipation built up is belied by the farcial nature of the plot.I for one felt cheated of a possible tight thriller."
2,Made-for-TV type fluff,"Reading this book was like watching a made-for-TV movie; it was somewhat entertaining, somewhat predictable, somewhat preposterous and completely forgetable. I read this during a beach vacation and it definitely kept me interested, but always in the back of my mind was this voice telling me how ridiculous the book was. Read it if you have nothing better to read."
1,Couldn't watch it all.,"I hate to disagree with the other reviewers, but after about 40 minutes of this, I had enough. Perhaps it's me - but the double-takes and dopey songs just didn't do it for me."
3,"Expensive, yet not helpful for much more than homework.","Bought this book for an introductory digital design class at my university. Didn't use it much except for homework problems. Although the book does cover a lot of content in detail, the wording and organization of the book is very poor. Sometimes it'll present topics in a sequence that doesn't make very much sense, or the wording of the book will simply confuse the reader. Tried to use it to study for an exam or midterm, but consistently found myself struggling with the book due to a lack of relevant examples and unclear phrasing. For the price of this book, I think that there's much better out there."
1,Terrible,"This text book was the required text book for my Digital Techniques I class. I'm simply posting this remark so other students will not be as unfortunate as I was in wasting money on this book. I tried using the book at the beginning of the semester, but after 2 weeks I gave up on using it. I haven't opened it since. I felt that there was no since of coherency in the text. I felt the examples were rather poor. There's not even a glossary to look up terms, and the index is not helpful. I don't know enough about digital design to give very constructive criticism on this text. But I know that as a student, I found this book to be very bad. There are many other text books out there that do a much better job of introducing the topics of an introductory digital design class. Use one of those. Not this one.Computer Engineering Undergraduate"
1,Not what ordered,"We ordered a hard back copy of this book instead we received an international paperback copy, which wasnt even listed as option on site. Totally disappointed."
1,Heck no!,"I think the negative reviews have summed it up pretty good. This book is not clear about anything. They go into great confusing detail just to explain the simplest concepts. Theres not (if any) good step by step guides on how to do the problems in the book. They explain concepts and problems in paragraph format which is dumb. I actually just transfered to a tech school because the texts the University was using were just plain awful. Before buying your books, check out the reviews on here. I have found that most are pretty accurate."
2,the making of 2001: a space odyssey,"this book was a disappointment. there was very little information about the actual making of the movie. there were pages and pages of reviews of the movie, and general information about what the movie may mean. there was none of the ""behind the scenes"" stuff that can be so interesting. and no pictures!!"
4,A Must for the obsessive film buff,"Everything you always wanted to know about the fantastic movie in one place. From the original Arthur C. Clarke short story that served as template for the final film to great commentary and inside stories on the ""inventing as they went along"" groundbreaking special effects. Very thorough, definitely for fans of Kubrick."
5,Only one of the best....,"Alongside the likes of ""Wide eyed"", ""Live the life"" and ""Speechless"", ""Kansas"" is definitely one of the greatest Christian albums of all time. It's also better than any secular album I remember hearing in the last few years. I wasn't familiar with Jennifer Knapp until I was told that I had to get this album, England isn't the best place in the world to be a fan of Christian music. When I opened the CD and began to play it, it took a while for me to take in what I was listening to. The songs are definitely more like ""rock"" than a lot of Christian stuff. Once I'd got through the first layer though, I discovered a wonderful aura around all of the songs, a feeling that takes one closer to God. Quickly the songs took a new light and all shone individually. Every song is great, ""Undo me"", ""Whole again"" and ""Trinity"" in particular. Fantastic stuff, I think you'll agree."
5,I wish she would write more music...,"Music can speak to people and touch them to lift their spirits, and faith in God. I think that this music is real and speaks to many.. I wish I could send it to everyone I know. I am working on it. : )"
5,"This CD is so powerful, everyone needs to experience it.",This music is beautiful and powerful. It is full of Jennifer Knapp's God-given talent. She shows how deep her salvation is. She is a witness for God in every song on this CD. Everyone should buy this and experience it for themselves!
5,AWESOME!!!,I have every cd of hers and the music is beautiful. I eagerly await the next cd. She is my favorite christian singer. Absolutely beautiful!!!!
3,Capable Yet Immature,"When Kansas first emerged with the Evangelical Pop Rock, I really enjoy this album until several of the songs became too repetitive and lacking depth and soul. However three songs on this album are beautiful, which are Hold Me Now, Faithful To Me (Prelude and reprise) and Refine Me."
5,Down and to the point,"I saw Jennifer Knapp at a smalltown concert last year in the rain. She appeared calmly subdued but very professional. Then she hit the first chords on her acoustic guitar and really fired up the audience. See her if you can. Whole Again, Undo Me, In The Name, and Romans are my four favorites. Believe me you get your money,s worth."
5,An out of this world cd!,"Jennifer Knapp is a wonderful artist. I recommend this cd for everyone! I had a wonderful time listening to this cd when I first recieved it, not knowing what to expect, but it turned out to be one heck of an album. She is truly an artist with down to earth lyrics, and melody."
5,OUTSTANDING JOB FOR JENNIFER,I HEARD THIS ALBUM BY ACCIDENT AND I DO NOT REGRET IT A BIT. THIS ALBUM IS A FINE DISPLAY OF JENNIFER'S TALENT AND FAITH. I AS WELL AM STRONGLY RECOMMENDING THIS ALBUM. *****BRAD*****
5,"A must-have, no matter what kind of music you like!","The first time I saw Jennifer Knapp was when she was in concert with dcTalk. Granted, I was sick that night and spent half of the concert trying to keep my bearings in the screaming crowds. I was miserable and felt wretched . . . until Jennifer Knapp came out onstage. At first I was less than impressed with her music. But then ""Undo me,"" came on, and I was immmedately hooked. I was in a great mood, and then went on a quest to buy Jennifer's CD. Until two weeks ago, I didn't actually go get ""Kansas,"" and now that I have, I haven't regretted the decision once. My top five vaforites are: ""Undo me,"" ""In the name,"" ""Martyrs and Thieves,"" ""Refine me,"" and ""Faithful To Me."""
5,My Favorite In 1999,Jennifer Knapp reaches into the depths of her soul on this album. The lyrics challenge me everytime I listen!
5,A great CD from beginning to end,"This CD is an excellent debut that shows tons of talent in its author. Through the entire CD you hear Jennifer's talent in songwriting, guitar playing and singing. She loves God and shows it through her music. The very first song, ""faithful to me"" is great as jennifer sings without instrument accompaniment. Than the rocking ""Undo Me"" comes on and you are hooked. There is not a weak song on the entire CD and I recommend it for anyone."
3,found a error,In this movie there is one scene where they are drinking champange & she is reading the lable & she saids it's made in France. Well they showed the lable & it is a low price wine from Calif.
3,A bit slow paced but ok.,Just a surprise close to the end makes this movie. Dont look for anything special as far as gore ect. just a half way decent movie to kill time.
2,Beyond Bizarre,"This was a movie i picked up in the video store and, i'm ashamed to say, I judged it by its cover. Bad move. It was in the Horror section and the front cover showed a rather menacing monkey, so i thought i'd be in for a scary little treat. however, half an hour into the film I realised i was watching a bizarre film about a woman with a pet monkey, who lived with her wheelchair-bound father who she didnt like too much. On the upside, there were a few interesting scenes where the woman imagined retaliating against her father, but thats about it really. the monkey didnt really do anything fantastic either. bizarre film."
4,great but it will take longer to refill even with quick fill cap,i used this on my defender and it works good but the it takes so much longer to fill up and the tube sometimes becomes detatched im impressed wit the new maxinfusion blasters but i still have my cps 2100 and it packs a little more of a punch but it water runs out too quickly
3,Decent Advertising Flick,"I enjoyed seeing David Allen Greer, and Rip torn especially inthis movie. The beer ads they create are funny enough to see the moviefor. I picked this one up 7 yrs ago out of the discount rack at avideo store and have since watched it more than some of the newreleases I own. fun and entertaining, but didn't win an oscar for areason."
5,"""BEER IS THE JOINT!!!!""",This movie always stuck in my mind over the years as one of the funniest I've ever seen from the first time I veiwed it way back in the '80's! It has that undeniable Mel Brooks feel and the characters really play their roles to the tee! Wish there was more than 5 stars I could give for this one! Still have my copy of it on VHS but I sure wish it would come out one day on DVD so I can get an even clearer copy! Please let us know if and when that'll ever happen?
3,PAST ITS EXPIRATION DATE,I think you have to be a connoiseur of early 80s humour and culture to appreciate this! Either that or it's really bad-just can't tell!
3,Nice light fare.,"I was drawn to this CD in 1997 when ""Everlasting Love"" was playing on the radio. I soon brought the CD and was a little dissapointed as I thought I would hear the same kind of tracks. It's not all bad, though. There are some moments. That is, if you like hip hop, rap and such. Over all, it was alright."
5,"gorgeous illustrations, info. you won't find anywhere else","This has got to be the single best guide to Antarctica's unusual wildlife. Everything is covered here, from Gentoo Penguins to Crab-Eater Seals (which don't actually eat crabs). Beautiful illustrations make it easy to identify birds & other animals while your out on the ice. If you're going to the White Continent, you'll want to stash this little book in your daypack. This book was useful when my husband & I visited the Antarctic peninsula, which we chronicle in our DVD ""T&T's Real Travels in Antarctica"" (also available on amazon.com)."
1,TERRIBLE NOT TERRIFYING!!,"Don't even waste your money unless your the type of person that has to see for yourself. Another review compared this to ""Silence of the Lambs"" saying that this is by far more terrifying, that person must have directed or starred in this movie. This was really a joke and not horror at all. NOT GOOD"
4,surprise,"I am not a fan of horror movies. Perhaps it is generational. But I watched ALL DARK PLACES in its entirety and found it dealing with problems of love, dedication, demons and addiction in a serious and successful manner.The acting was fine, as were the photography and dialogue.Surprise, surprise, horror film or not, I enjoyed and admired it."
5,Very Intelligent Psychological Thriller,"I'm of the opinion that the creepiest films are not the ones that go for pop-up cheap thrills, but those that linger and haunt you long after you've turned the television off. This movie does just that. All Dark Places reminds me of the classic days of horror films. It starts with life seeming fairly normal, but slowly cracks appear in the foundation... And the character development is far superior to what you typically get in a modern-day horror movie. Great acting, writing, and cinematography. And plenty of surprises too! It made me want to watch it a second time :)"
4,very dark indeed,"An excellent film. Truly scary and well played. The characters and direction is fantastic. A suburban ""shining, Complete with appropriately dark humor and perhaps the greatest evil clown ever. A great addition to any collection."
1,What an aweful movie....these 5 star reviews are totally fake...you gotta be kidding me,"I'm getting really sick of these glowing 5 star reviews for items & movies on amazon that turn out to be fake. This movie sucked. Nobody could legitimately give it more than a 2. Its totally amateurish in all regards, acting, plot, & script. I mean the Top 1000 reviewer from amazon actually compared this to silence of the lambs.....you gotta be kidding me. This isn't the first time I've seen these Top 1000 and Vine Voice reviewers giving fake reviews either. It simply isn't possible to think this is a 5 star movie. Currently on IMDB website this movie is rated only 2.5 average out of 10, by 91 people!!!!! (That would be a 1.25 average on a scale of 5, which means on average, everyone hated it.)"
3,"Excellent, but ...","This is an excellent flick. The main character is on a slippery slope to madness - or maybe not. It's been compared to The Shining. I think this is better. So why only three stars? Because in places it just doesn't hold together. Like, why is there a scene where the couple has great, drugged-out sex followed by a scene where she accuses him of being, well, a druggie? And who IS this clown? THE clown I mean, not the main character. Is he seeking vengeance for a past insult? If he is, he's gone a bit overboard. Is he feeding a child's suppressed hatred? If so, the kid seems to be having a good time, showing no signs of past trauma. Or maybe he's just pure evil. It would have been four stars if some of these questions had been resolved. But I'll be watching this again for sure."
5,All the dark places- a must see!,"A unique modern day depiction of the evil that lurks in the night; centered around three of everyone's favorite vices- sex, drugs and rock and roll. This movie is brilliant, and promises to keep you perched on the edge of your seat. To me, that's exactly what a movie in the horror genre is supposed to do. A must see!!"
2,IT JUST FELL APART,"WE WERE SO EXCITED TO FIND THIS BOOK!!!MY TWO SONS LOVED THE MOVIE...THE JOURNAL WAS SUCH A WONDERFUL IDEA.WHILE THE ILLUSTRATIONS AND STORIES WERE EXCELLENT,THE BINDING WAS NOT AS GREAT.PAGES STARTED TO FALL OUT THE FIRST DAY AND CONTINUED UNTIL IT WAS TOO FRUSTRATING FOR THEM TO USE ANYMORE.IF THE BOOK HAD NOT FALLEN APART ON US,IT WOULD HAVE BEEN 5 STARS."
5,A great band and great album!,"Mercy Creek sounds like what the White Stripes only wish they could sound like. Rocking and driving with an obvious homage to their folky roots, this exciting duo is one of the few bands that would feel equally at home on the Top 40 Rock charts and on the Top 40 Folk charts.Like most great duos, they are consistently releasing better and better albums and this, their latest, will blow you away. It's almost scary to think how good the next album will be if they stay on the same track...."
3,Bloody Mama,"The movie arrived in good time, however it was a 'copy' from Blockbuster and the quality of the video was very poor andthe sound quality was poor... I purchased it for a gift...It was very blurry... But what can you expect when it was the last one available??????"
2,"Oh, what happened?","It seems that Xymox continues to spiral downward, as they try to clone early goth bands. Their music has become bland and forgettable. What we are left with is only fond memories of a glorious past. Goodbye Xymox."
5,A rare blend of scholarship and freshness,"The first thing to be said about Ms.Velez' book is that it is written in a disarmingly straightforward style - a rare if not unique occurrence in contemporary scholarly writings. Without shying away from tackling the complexities of an issue (and there are many in the book) Ms. Velez' style allows the reader to concentrate on the content rather than wrestle with tortuous syntax and intricate constructions. It is perhaps for this reason that the author manages so felicitously to blend her cultivated voice with that of the ""informer"" in a delicately balanced counterpoint. This, in turn, is well suited to the multifaceted role of F.G.V., who play the role of a self-centered first actor as well as that of an anonymous yet ideally representative prototype of a time and a place. Or rather, multiple times and places."
1,Killed My Lawn. Not my weeds!,"Be careful. This product claims it ""Won't Harm Lawn Grasses"". Well it basically killed my lawn! I read the label and followed the directions. I had one of the nicest lawns in our neighborhood and now it looks terrible. I believe its important to warn others before they use this product!"
4,Cute Book,I just read this book yesterday. I thought it was both cute and interesting. I have always found that books involving people caring for animals in trouble are good and this one is great for younger kids.
1,Scholarly Analysis,This book appears old and outdated even though some of the information is current and relevant. The images need to be updated. The book is stuck in a time warp from cover to cover. The book may have good information but the presentation and formating is all wrong. It's video for heavens sake use the new technology available. This book does not. Zettl is very boring.
4,"Very Compact Camera, Pictures are so-so","This is my second Kodak compact digital camera. The previous one I owned was a V530 which was very similar to this camera. I was hoping that the V603 would correct one problem that plagued the V530 -- consistently dark pictures in full automatic mode. Turns out this problem persists on this camera too, probably a result of using common software within both of these camera models. But at least the V603 has a ""Perfect Touch"" picture fixup capability which, when applied to a dark picture, generally fixes the problem. But you have to fix each picture individually using Perfect Touch which can be somewhat of a hassle. The other nice thing about this camera in comparison to the V530 was the ability to charge the battery in-camera. The camera has a nice, sleek body with a good, solid feel. Overall not too bad a camera."
4,Does well what it does.,"V603 is a very small and well made compact point-and-shoot'er. I liked it's small size, brilliant LCD, and overall metal body. However, it uses too small battery that always make me nervous about the juice. (The camera won't show you the charge level unless it's almost gone) Also, V603 doesn't have any fancy mechanism like vibration reduction.However, I'm very happy with it's software side, I mean, the operational software that's inside the camera.It has a nice panorama stitching function, which lets you combine up to 3 pictures. Creates a very sharp and seamless panorama that was better than any similar software I've seen that runs on the computer. Another fun widget is called Perfect Touch, which compensates underexposures typical to a flash indoors shot. Of course you can do the similar thing in Photoshop, but hey, it's just more handier.I recommend V603 for its low price, nice looks, and some of those fun and easy functions."
4,error E45,"This camera has been great, I've been using it for about 4 months, but i just got error E45 on screen -- lens will not retract. I am going to mail it in for warranty repair."
4,F.Haddad,"As w/the other review, this camara is fantastic and produces quality fotos. The problem is w/the lense. It stopped retracting and now i have to buy a new one. I sent it in to be repaired once already for 150$ for the same problem. I have the V550 and now buying the V603 or higher since i already have the printer dock."
1,Kodak's warranty is awful!,"This camera arrived not working properly. I sent it to Kodak's warranty company and it was sent back as ""repaired"". I then stored the ""repaired"" camera for about 3 weeks till I used it again. It was not repaired and again did not work properly. I returned the camera again and was denied warranty. Not only that but Kodak's repair company wanted the same price to repair this camera again as buying an updated version. They also required rediculous return shipping and ""evaluation"" fees - $35 to get a unusable camera back. So I completely lost out. This was the very worst experience I have ever had with a company. Kodak has lost my business forever."
2,"unacceptable, kodak you missed the boat","I'm writing this review because I'm beginning to appreciate the reviews from other customers when I buy things. I was in the market for a new digital camera because the one I had accidentally went for a swim. I had a 3 MP kodak easyshare from 2002. I was generally satisfied, it took decent pictures, definitely easy to use. So, this time I thought I'd stick with kodak, just upgrade the MP and get a smaller camera. I bought the V603. To be fair, it's small, probably too small trying to work the buttons. Outside the pictures are pretty good, inside, two words, horrible, and useless. I called kodak, they walked me through changing around the settings as I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt, nope, still bad. It was unacceptable to me so I returned the camera, paid the restocking fee."
5,Constant Chills,"Though few words can describe the superiority in which these players execute this music, some that come to mind are: exquisite, pinnacle, and exhilerating. This recording brilliantly elucidates the versatility of the Trombone, including 3 different types (alto, tenor, and bass), in all styles of music, from Eric Clapton's ""Layla,"" to Barber's ""Adagio for Strings."" Perfect intonation and superb interpretation, along with exceptionally clean articulations and releases makes the entire CD a pleasant background music, or even better, one to listen to in the dark, without interruption. Every time I listen, chills run down my spine, and not just at specific moments... all the time. Ultimately, it provides the perfect release from daily stress. The trombone at its absolute best."
5,Easy to use,"I have studied tarot for decades and found this book to still be helpful. Accurate descriptions of the meanings of the cards, well organized. A good addition to your book collection weather you have read for years or are just starting out."
4,Great,I use this book a lot for the spreads I use when I do readings. I love it. I really enjoy all the spreads!
4,intersting reading,"Handy quicky reffence guide for those wanting to learn tarot. it gives for an interesting read, and spreads to follow"
5,A Great Little Compendium,"This guide really has a lot going for it -- a good organizational grouping makes it easy to use, and therefore return to. It is thorough without being repetitious. I plan on using it as a primer in the beginning Tarot class I teach through my local Community Ed., because it has a welcoming open feel to it and the card definitions are concise and accurate. Physically it is a book lover's book -- the friendly chunky size, the wonderful paper, the smell of the book and the well placed and interesting illustrations make it quite fascinating to me. I like what else she incorporates into the Tarot study (though only briefly): how to use numerology with Tarot, crystals, a little astrology, add to a student's curiosity about these mystical cards. The spreads are grouped into sections, and are useful and insightful. I only don't like the title, but since I love the book, I think that's a minor quibble."
2,So Bogus,"Once again a book that is 5 1/2"" by 6 1/2"". I am getting so sick of that. I thought this book would be more indepth but it is the just the same old typical modern day B.S. ""if you get the fool maybe your immature"" WHAT! Are you kidding me. It has some good ideas for spreads but it largely disappointing. Sorry I wasted my money. I already have umpteen book that say the same thing."
5,Great Entertainment for Children,"I have three children ages 2, 4, & 7. All three were spell bound watching this DVD. My 2 year old laughed out loud multiple times which is unusual. All in all, I highly recommend the Land Before Time series and in particular Good Times & Good Friends."
3,Okay for the price.,"This cage only fits small , below average size bottles. It also did not come with any additional screws which I would have preferred. You should not pay more than $5.99 for this anywhere else."
3,Ok.,"The glitter started falling off immediately after installing the case on my phone, also it was very hard to take off. It is pretty though!"
5,excellent,"really funny, the brothers in this show are hularious, i thoughly enjoyed it, it came fast and priced very reasonalble"
4,Christmas present,I brought this movie for my husband for Christmas and he likes it. He thinks it is funny and thinks Anna Faris is silly in the movie.
2,Waste of time,"Not funny! Didn't like any of the characters. Don't waste you money. This movie was ridiculous, crude and totally absurd."
4,Quirky and cute.,"Just Friends starring Ryan Reynolds and Amy Smart is silly fun. Don't take this movie too seriously, it's just one of those films you see for hijinxics and laughs. Smart is delightful as ever and Reynolds is quite a comic genius but of course Anna Faris steals every scene she is in, the scene with the toothpaste is simpy Anna. Cute date movie, this movie is worth checking out."
5,Hilarious and creative!,"When I was told by some friends of mine that we were going to see this movie, I wasnt too sure if it was going to be good or not. It was very funny, and very creative. Ryan Reynolds plays one funny fat kid. Amy Smart and Ana Faris's sexy characters in this movie just make it that much better. If you want a movie that you can go to, without having to worry about a deep plot or any strange twists, this is the movie for you. Tons of laughs guaranteed. See it and find out for yourselves..."
4,Please enter a title for your review,"I thought this movie would kinda suck, because the trailer emphasizes Reynolds in the fat suit doing all this stupid hammy eyebrow acting, and it seemed like it would revolve around a lot of dumb one-note gags, but it really surprised me with how much substance it had, well for a goofy romantic comedy anyway. After Anna Faris' kinda non-role in Waiting... she gets back to doing the retarded facial expressions she does best. The stuff teenage Chris writes to Jamie is so amazingly cute and injects some valueable John Hughes/80s humanity into the relatively trashy flashy modern teen/collegiate oriented hollywood comedy formula. All of the characters are based on stereotypes to some extent, but humour is drawn more from developing distinctive quirks than from simply playing off of those stereotypes."
3,Storyline,The storyline is good...typical!!! Was funny and worth seeing as a rental. Reynolds was so much funnier in Two Guys and A Girl!!!Good rental
3,Surprised I laughed!,"I'm not one for this type of movie, but my dd wanted to see it, so I rented it LATE one night. I laughed so hard I almost cried. Maybe it was because I was so giddy from lack of sleep..who knows, but it was a good late night flick!"
4,One any guy can relate too.........,"I figured ""Oh no another chick flick for the wife"". Boy was I wrong. This is a romantic/comedy any guy can enjoy. With a theme any guy can relate too. A girl you really like that only considers you as a friend. It spins many funny scenes off of that premise. If you like Ryan Reynalds he's great in this one."
1,The Most Unlikeable Hero In Movie History,"If you want to enjoy this film..watch the prview and then forget it!Chris is an egotisical jerk..He is rude to his mother...Cruel to his kid brother (who deserves it) Irresponsible to his profession.He is concerned with only His needs the entire film..No charm, no warmth and definitely NO INTELLIGENCE!This is the first movie I have EVER watched that lacked even on scene I would like see again..I avoid people like this in real life and I feel I wasted a lot of time watching them...And finally for a topping, we have a six or seven year old child closing the film with an obscenty...Dumb movie and I was even dumber for watching it all the way through..."
1,extra crispy corny&I fell asleep,"usually Ryan Reynolds is able to use his Chevy Chase vibe to work in his films,but this film was boring from the word jump.filled with alot fo cliches&bit so many other films over the years that I forgot this was suppose to be a original movie all onto itself."
4,Good date movie,Was funny and actually an enjoyable romantic comedy-- I recommend watching the movie with your significant other to score points. :)
2,"A few good lines, but not enough to save this movie",This movie had too much crude humor and too many unbelievable plot twists for me. But the acting was good.
1,not a blu-ray,"This is not hi-def quality. It's lo-def recorded onto a blu-ray disc. All the cost, none of the detail. Doesn't even have the extras that are on the dvd. For the record, I loved this movie and was very anxious to get it in hi-def, but this was a complete rip-off. Don't waste your money. Just get the dvd."
4,Review of Just Friends,"This is such a funny movie. No, it was never going to win any oscars and if you watch it with that in mind and just enjoy the idiocy, it is a really god time. My wife and I have watched it more than twice (for me, that is the sign of a good movie). Anna Faris is great, the younger brother is great, the situational comedy here is predictable but a lot of fun."
2,a little disappointing,"Reynolds is a great actor, as usual. But the forever cycle this movie has you in gets you to a point that you say 'enough already'. It really should be that hard."
5,Love it!,"First of all, Ryan Reynolds. What is not to love? Add in Anna Faris to the mix, and it is hilarious. This is one of my favorite movies. I bought 2 copies, one for me and one for my boyfriend because he likes it as much as I do. This is not Oscar worthy or Academy Award winning material. It is silly, mindless entertainment. Don't expect anything less. That being said, it is hilarious. :)Anna Faris is a psycho pop star (think Brittney 2007) and Ryan Reynolds is Chris Brander, a dorky, former-fatty nerd turned music business ladies man. He returns to NJ when Anna's character causes the plane to crash. He has to confront the feelings and town he's been avoiding for 10 years."
5,Funniest movie,"This is the funniest movie, it's one i have watched over and over again. I bought his for my brother for Christmas because he loves it as much as I do!"
2,Painful,"Boyfriend says it was a romantic comedy *for men*. I found it lacking in humor, likeable characters, and was more than once tempted to jab myself in the eye with a fork.The physical comedy between the brothers was enough to keep my guy entertained, but the inability to develop engaging characters or imaginative jokes (there's only so many times accidentally stunning someone is funny - and don't even get me started on the fat angle)was...well...painful."
1,can we give minus points please?,"the crappiest movie I've ever come across in my entire life. Is this ""movie"" supposed to be a ""comedy""? Well... excuse ME?! where were the laughs hidden? oh maybe flushed down the drain? Pretending to be ""slapstick"", but waaaay over the top and lacking subtlety. It was painful and embarrassing to watch a movie with sheer bad acting and a brainless storyline. one big pile of garbage and a real stinker. Incredibly booooring. there was NOT ONE FUNNY SCENE during the 90 mins it laaaasted... (yawn yawn yawn). Totally 1 dimensional. What a waste of time, what a waste of money."
5,review,"I bought this as a Christmas gift, it was delived quickly so I don't have to worry about a gift."
1,Very offensive,Not what I expected I thought I had ordered Johnathan and Cahrolette Together.. I gave it to someone because I did not even want this in my house and they too were offended.
4,Love this movie!,So I must say my sister is the one who first introduced me to this movie. I love the comedy aspect in it as well as the useless jokes from Rusty. Ryan Reynolds is just awesome in this movie and now I watch at least once a year around christmas time. If not more than that.
3,"Menu skips but, movie and special features play fine","The movie appeared to have arrived on time and in good shape. The case and disc appeared to be in brand new condition but, regardless of what player I attempt to watch it on the menu skips like crazy. Must be a manufacturing defect. The movie and special features play fine so, I guess it's not that big of a deal."
3,Just Friends movie,"I'd seen this before, so when I watched it again I remembered a bit of it. It's an ok movie. It's a comedy for the most part, but it's more typical of your light movies. It was easy to follow and getting through the movie wasn't so bad because of the laughs. I wouldn't watch it again on purpose, but I'm sure others would find this delightful. It just wasn't for me. For the price, you really can't go wrong."
5,Love this movie.,This movie is Hi-lar-i-ous. My husband and I had many a laugh out loud moment. So much so we bought it from Itunes. Sorry amazon--someone gift carded us. But at least you lead us there!
3,Welcome to the Friendzone...,"A movie that most can relate to, Just Friends, brings to the screen the story of an overweight down-on-his-luck high school kid from N.J. who has a traumatic experience when his attempt at declaring his undying love to his beautiful and much more popular friend ends up a disaster. Subsequently he leaves town and heads west, where ten years later he is successful professionally as well as with the ladies. That is when fate brings him back home where things have not changed as much as he would have liked...Ryan Reynolds, Amy Smart, and the rest of the cast carry out their performances well.In short, the music is great, the acting is pretty good, the plot/setting is interesting, while the dialogues are pretty average and could have been better.In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will provide for an evening's entertainment."
4,JUST FRIENDS IS JUST HILARIOUS!,"This is the second movie I've watched with Ryan Reynolds in it in a short while. This movie is every bit as good as ""Waiting"" if not better. A quirky romantic comedy that is funny and has some heart. The DVD transfer is excellent and there are some very funny and interesting extras."
2,"Ryan's great, but even his talent can't save this ridiculous movie","Ryan Reynolds has wonderful comic timing and I usually laugh when he merely changes his facial expression. The problem with this movie is that the writing is sub-par and the plot goes nowhere. Amy Smart is adorable as usual, and she and Ryan do have decent chemistry, but those are the only redeeming factors. One of the most annoying things about the movie is the normally cute and goofy Anna Faris, whose character is as nice to listen to as nails being run down a chalkboard. Do not waste the time watching this!!! Luckily, I bought this as a gift for a friend, who said he liked it (?!?!). At least I do not own it."
2,MOVIE W/NO SUBSTANCE,"Everything about this movie was PURE COMPLETE GARBAGE!!!. Nothing made any sense. If this is what people call humor and/or funny, no wonder reality shows are common now. I'm glad I brought this used which cost me little or nothing. Would have been very upset if full price was spent. Unless u just like the actors/actress in film (by the way their performance was extremely poor) BEWARE!."
1,Juvenile humor at most,"I began watching this movie with great expectations, made more so by Ryan Reynolds' performance in ""The Proposal"". However, I could not finish watching this attempt. Ugh!! The most positive comment I will make is that this is juvenile humor brought to a new high (or low depending on your perspective). Don't let the PG-13 rating lull you into thinking that this movie is okay for adolescents, no way! Between the raunchy humor, physical groping, and doing anything except being ones' true self, I could not finish this movie. I would suggest that you seriously consider your options before buying ""Just Friends"" - just say NO!!"
4,A touching Comedy,"I can honestly say that this is my favorite comedy. It has high levels of laughter and some extreme touching moments. Just Friends will make you laugh tears and cry them also. This movie includes the hotty Ryan Reynolds,Amy Smart, Anna Faris, and Chris Klein."
2,garbage,"Like Ryan Reynolds, think he's funny, and though it made me laugh a couple times, not worth the hour and a half of your life."
5,Ole school,Nothing bad to say about this cd this.Real musicians real music from back in the day.I had the vinyl back in the day and just finally upgraded to the cd
2,Clever premise but boring execution,"""After Midnight"" got so many great reviews I decided to buy a copy thinking it would be like Campfire Tales' Trilogy of Terror or even Tales From the Crypt.It was released in 1989 so I was looking forward to some 80's flavor.The premise had promise and the main story was clever but the three stories told in the midst of the main story were somewhat boring and about as scary as a white sheet thrown over someones head with the eyes cut out.Marg Helgenberger's performance and a performance by 80's teen icon Judie Aronson are the highlights of the lot. .It couldn't decide if it wanted to be a Tales From the Crypt clone or something more serious.Not bad if you haven't many other choices but I would never watch it twice~!"
1,After Midnight,"Good premise and stories but sadly done horribly with even bad for a Budget Film ""special Effects""if it can be called that,My favorite story is the ""Surprise party"" because it is the most plausible and actually the best story to me of the movie,but Sadly once it got to the End and the obvious became dreadfully clear but worst the end is done in an almost comical way and the potential was lost."
5,"Excellent little ""vignette"" style horror flick!","I haven't seen this movie in years. I do remember it quite well, though. I remember each of the stories being unique and ""stylish"" for the late 80s. I'm a bit upset about the price for the DVD here on Amazon since it is only in ""mono"" DD. I'll put it in the cart and wait for the price to drop a couple bucks before purchasing it! Somewhere around my mess of a house, I have this movie on VHS. GOOD stuff. I recommend it if you're a fan of the ""multiple tales"" theme!"
2,MGM screws up again,"The movie itself is an overly tame, bloodless piece that would merit a PG-13 nowadays. The stories are okay, with Marg Helgenberger turning in the film's best performance as a victimized answering service operator, but there's nothing else about the film that stands out.Except ...MGM Home Video, the people that messed up the ratios of the Ingmar Bergman films a few years ago, and then rereleased ""The Graduate"" on DVD in the same non-anamorphic print with a new cover proves they are still asleep at the wheel by claiming this DVD is anamorphic. It isn't. Another disappointment from a once major studio."
4,THIS WAS A GOOD 80'S MOVIE!!!,"FORGET THAT REVIEW ABOVE THIS THAT PERSON OBVIOUSLY WROTE FOR THE WRONG MOVIE....BUT THIS WAS A GOOD MOVIE A LIL DATED BUT THE STORY IS SO GOOD KIND OF UNIQUE.....ONLY ONE PROBLEM, TO MAKE THESE STORIES REALLY STAND OUT IT NEEDED MORE GORE AND THATS WHATS MISSING. BUT ALL IN ALL GREAT STORY WITH GREAT POTENTIAL. ALSO I LOVE THAT CUTE LIL ACTRESS PAMELA SEGALL!!!"
5,great band,"I saw them in concert, and they had so much life, it blew me away. there wasn't a large crowd that night, but that didn't stop them from making it a blast for us who were there. I couldn't help but buy the cd after that concert. The guys rock!"
3,Chances are this isn't the band you're looking for.,"Now, don't get me wrong, I'm sure they have their fans too, but a fair warning--this is NOT hide's band Zilch. I had heard that Zilch (the Japanese one) has released an album stateside, I was quite excited. I thought I found it--wrong!Nothing against this band, but it was a bit of a bummer to me when I found out I had the wrong Zilch, and (especially in light of the first reviewer, who seems...confused) I thought I'd put this out there so no one makes the same mistake.(note: I gave this a 3-star rating just because that's in the middle.)"
4,Great chance to see Gypsy Rose Lee!,"Yes, its a lightweight film. Its also a great chance to see some rare footage of Gypsy Rose Lee's short film career. Randolf Scott (a handsome matinee idol in his day) is a strong veteran actor and plays his contrived role to the hilt. Don't expect plot; just enjoy the rich visual experience of this vacuous film-as-entertainment novelty feature."
2,No closed caption,Need closed caption on your movies.When will you start having closed captioned movies.Let us know when whenever this happens
5,a map to wholeness,"Western society is more and more fragmented. Indigenous cultures, before contact, weren't. This book is clearly written from the perspective of someone who has spent a lot of time among indigenous peoples. Really good books are such that you can read them several times, and get new insights each time. This book is like that, and I re-read it once a year, to get new insights. It has a lot of the heart of indigenous cultures. The heart of the problem is usually a problem of the heart, and this book is very useful for getting to the heart of issues. As a community organizer, student of minimal equipment wilderness survival, and even just human being trying to improve, I have used this book a lot. I have given at least 7 copies of this book to friends. I wish there were more books like this in print. It is really, really good. This is easily among the best 10 books I've read in my life."
3,Wish it had been better quality,"My dad (age 95) enjoyed it, but the quality was, at times, not as good as I thought it would be."
5,Great CD,"Let me start by saying I was amazed to find I loved every last song on this CD! I have been slowly growing my musical taste into more ebm (whatever you wanna call it) type stuff and Icon of Coil really helped push me further into this realm of music. As a DJ there are a ton of good songs on this disc for your dance floor.Good dance floor tracks include:Floorkiller (best dance floor song)Shallow NationActivateRegretwnEverlastingFormer SelfFictionI would highly recommend buying this CD as both a music fan and a DJ. I would also recommend if you can find it, buy the CD Single for ""Shallow Nation"", it has a better version of both ""Shallow Nation"" and ""Floorkiller"" on it than this CD."
5,5 stars because it's a debut,"Well, it's the best debut album I ever heard from an EBM group. Great danceable tracks, the correct attitude on the vocals, cleverly used house influences, great synthetic abilities. Hear to Former Self, FloorKiller, You Just Died, Swallow Nation... Well, hear all the album. The only problem is that they are a bit less innovative than other industrial groups and their lyrics don't make perfect sense if you read a whole song."
3,Better than Expected,"Like a lot of people in America, I came to know Billie Piper through the ""Doctor Who"" and later ""Secret Diary of a Call Girl."" Not one to follow actors/actresses I was surprised to find out Billie Piper had been a major pop star in England. I listened to the CD and while I'm not terribly impressed, it wasn't nearly as bad as its detractors made it out to be. You have to take into account when these songs were released. They are heavily influenced by the Spice Girls, Mariah Carey, and yes Britney, though many of the songs have a heavier R&B influenced. Piper's voice is better than average, but the music itself is pretty much standard studio generated. It won't make my top, but it will make it's way onto my itunes list."
1,BAD BAD BAD,"I would give this 0 stars if it was an option. I feel like I got ripped off. This is not the program to get if you want to do digital scrapbooking.All they have is cheesy clip art with very few scrapbooking embellishments.There are no brads or buttons or ribbons. They do have mats and frames but that's about it. I would not recomend this program to anyone. I'm very disapointed in it. I thought that if I purchased Creating Keepsakes that it would be perfect for digiatl scrapbooking because they make the ""#1 scrapbooking magazine"" so I thought they would have what scrapbookers wanted. Do not purchase this product."
1,Skip this One,"I am an avid digital scrapbooker. I have used almost every software out there and not once have I felt so frustrated with a piece of software. The first problem is that for every page you make you have to insert either ART CD 1 or ART CD 2. This is a big hassle. Second, if the template you want to customize has clipart from both CD's then you are out of luck. It has you go back and forth putting in CD 1 then CD 2 then back to CD 1. Please save your money and puchase Scrapbook Factory, which in my opinion is the best scrapbooking software out there."
2,NOT an upgrade!! Same old program!,"I bought Creating Keepsakes Scrapbook designer several years ago. The version I bought back then was titled 'Scrapbook Designer Deluxe'. It's been a great program, though sometimes slow and lately has been crashing an awful lot. So I thought I'd upgrade and buy the newest version. I checked online and saw that this 'new' verson was in completely new packaging and was called 'Scrapbook Designer Platinum version 3'. So, I assumed, as anyone would that this was a new version. I just got it in the mail and it is exactly the same bulky program...the only thing they have added, is a few more images and sounds (and the new images aren't even that cute). But the program itself is exactly the same. It has not been redesigned--just repackaged. I am very disappointed."
5,Gorgeous Product,"In regards to the other reviewers comment that the pepper mill didn't look as good in person, this is my second Peugeot olive wood pepper mill and I can mirror your comment concerning the first one I received. Thankfully due to a breakup I was forced to part with my first one (which was less than stunning) and was very happy to receive a gorgeous new mill. I believe the inconsistency is due to the nature of olive wood overall and that ever item tends to be different in character. The grind is consistently wonderful and with the option to adjust you have full control. Yet again, Peugeot employs second to none construction and mechanics."
1,Puegot olive wood pepper mill,"Returned this, as it did not look nearly as nice in-person as it does online. Also - note that the pepper mill did not come in it's original packaging. Just the pepper mill in an amazon box."
1,DOA,Dead On Arrival!!!!!! This Lamp was dead right out of the box. I honestly cannot reccomend this item. Definitly Not worth the trouble. A real POS!!!!
2,Very Hard to Read,"David Thomson's ROSEBUD is like reading a movie script on LSD. Facts float in and out. Paragraphs are interrupted by a stream of consciousness dialogues that Thomson has with himself. Certain sections receive detailed coverage while others are brushed by with ease. Plainly put, it was a very hard book to read. The best sections deal with ""The Third Man"" and ""Touch of Evil,"" although both are much sparser than might be expected. The sexual conquests of Welles prior to his ballooning over 300 pounds are endless. It is only matched by his selfishness. Welles, it appears, was Charles Kane, and Kane was Orson Welles."
1,the worst of the Welles bios,"If there is a word for David Thomson's writing that word might be: twee. Another word: self-infatuated. How about: pompous. Having been overpraised in the past he now sees himself as a fellow artist and equal of a legend like Welles. An intellectual Rupert Pupkin, Thomson doesn't much bother with original research or new interviews so much as mincing daydreaming about how he and Welles are such spiritual kin. Ah, the labors of shared genius! These sections are kind of funny in a way but not for long. The vanity of this approach is breathtaking.Stick with Simon Callow's exhaustive 1st volume bio, or the very good one by Brady, or Barbara Leaming's somewhat hagiographic but highly entertaining bio (the best for capturing Welles'charisma and his own take on his life) or even the rather plodding but informative Bogdanovich interview book."
5,Tremendous account of the boy wonder and what happenned.,"Simply the definitive account of the greatest american talent in cinemas history. From the glory of Kane to the despair of daytime commercials, Thomson treats the subject with equal measures of admiration, pity and despair. A great story well told. As Kane said ""if I hadnt been rich, I COULD HAVE BEEN A TRULY GREAT MAN """
2,EASTER PARADE SOUNDTRACK,The music score of this CD is great but this particular one is in analogue/monoral. The sound is quite tiney in sound quality.
5,dance to the music,"i think this is a nice cd; my favorite is 'high heeled sneakers', which is a longer version than the original. this artist is a professional who has been around a long time. you may enjoy this cd whether young or old."
3,a dead man's shoes,"It can't be easy stepping into a dead man's shoes - and judging Craig Brown is pointless - at least we do have another CVCM novel.Sections of the book are on a par with Something Nasty (especially the interview with the Dominicans) ... others clearly aren't, including, sadly, the ending. This leads me to suggest that this is one for the fans - Bonfiglioli's past glories are enough to keep you going to the end.Perhaps it's as well Mr Brown wasn't able to tie up all the loose ends, thus leaving us with the luxury of being able to use our imaginations to decide what Bonfiglioli had planned for them and Charlie."
4,I have always liked this game,"A long time ago i had this toy and I remember loving it so now at the age of 17 I didn't know what to buy on this website to I Google'd what this game was (because I couldn't remember) Well anyways I found it and then found it here on amazon and its sooo fun but it can get boring after a while, it is one of those games you pick up for a little then sit it down and before you go out or go to sleep you play again,. I love this and I probably always will c:"
2,Fun----for a month,"Hello,I bought this toy thinking it would be the greatest thing ever. When I got it I was so thrilled and excited, and was like that for about a month. But after a while, it gets very repititive and boring being able to only play one type of game. Currently I am going to buy a Nintendo DS lite instead. I would recommend Animal Crossing. It's like this, but way better (for DS).I am not saying I hate this game, just after a while you don't even want to touch it. BLUCK. I think it would be more fun for real little kids."
5,Pricey but worth it if you need advice on this market,"While this book is indeed expensive, consider it a wise investment if you need insight into the mindset of this target market. This book covers how they think, why they think the way they do, what they do and predicts future buying behaviors. Brent includes tons of stories and examples and I think by the time I was done I had highlighted just about every page in the book with things worth remembering and acting upon."
1,The edge is dull.,I've been in the advertising world for 6 years and never have I read such a pompous book on marketing! They'd be lucky if they could sell wine to the French.
4,Take a chance,Beautiful mix of drum and bass and Indian classical music. If you like Tabla Beat Science you'll probably like this one.
1,Imported and inferior,"The cd is taken from an overseas lp master tape and is not mixed for cd. This cd was made without the consent of Crosby & Nash. If you want the best sound quality, purchase the American version ""Wind on the Water"" (MCA - 088 112 043-2) lovingly remastered by Stephen Barncard."
5,A great inspiration for all of us!,I am often left with a lack for the proper words when someone shares one of life's problems with me. This book has given me the words and the confidence to use them when one of these opportunities comes my way now.It has helped the lives of those I come into contact with as well as my own life.
2,Yawn,"For someone who knows about Porsches or restorations the book has little to offer. For someone who knows little about either I'd expect that they would find there to be too much detail. I'm sorry I bought it as I wouldn't read it again or lend it to friends, as I have with many other motorsport related books."
3,Why buy a Porsche?,"Before I even opened the book, a question came to mind. Why buy a Porsche? I have a number of buyer's guides and when I read them I am amazed that the company is still in business. How can they survive selling a car which has a leaking sunroof for 20 years??? German engineering is good, why can't they fix that quickly? Anyway, one buys a Porsche because it is a PORSCHE! That is what I got from the book. I did wished he had talked more about the car than other stories but the man obviously has a very full life.Those cars have quirks and need a lot of care. If you are going to buy one, don't spend all your money on the purchase of it since you will need a lot for maintenance. Learn to be a mechanic too. If you want a reliable automobile that won't need to be the center of your attention, buy a Toyota. What is the fun in that? This book helped me see more what Porsches are about, PASSION!!!!!!!"
5,Busted knuckles and oily finger nails. Intelligent and funny.,"In reviewing a few of the other reviews, it seems evident that there are two split camps with varying degrees of appreciation for Wilkinsons 'Gold Plated Porsche'. The book centers around the purchase and subsequent restoration of a Porsche 911 and the author skillfully introduces his own memoirs with several chapters of a chequered and adventurous past. The book is a great account of the authors mechanical apptitude blended with a self-depreciating sense of humour creating a very entertaining and worthwhile read. Personally I deeply enjoyed it and 'The Gold Plated Porsche' ranks as one of my favorites in the motorhead section of my library. Intelligent, funny and a light hearted read."
1,"save 8 bucks, and see it on the web","A dimestore paperback with a $4.90 premium because he writes the word ""Porsche"" in the title. not a picture of his exploits within a hundred miles of the book. But ever the publicity hound, he then posts the porsche pictures and much more succinct synopsis on the net! whatta ripoff to the book buyer.Ok, so he made his nut off my book purchase, but if you REALLY want to see pictures, not just read about this project, and also read many many more of his ""amusing"" articles for free, just go to the Falco aircraft website, where he is more verbose than he was in this book!get there quick google ""FlatSix.html"" then tool around under his aircraft for sale listing (already for sale again by the second owner, smart move after you read the Black and Decker shortcut) (lookup F.8L Falco, VH-SWF in the sale listings to find his articles)save yourself five bucks plus postage and actually see the restoration. for free, immediately."
3,Not enough Porsche stories...,"Overall I enjoyed the book. I liked learning about the history of Porsche and the Porsche restoration stories. The author does go off quite a bit of his own adventures, which I did not enjoy as much."
2,Disappointed,"I expected more from this book about his restoration of the porsche, not his life story. He seemed full of himself."
5,the best of cher,"i am not her hardcore fans, but man let me tell you, i love this song....the maxi single is a bit tedious, so i prefer this one, especially track 3."
1,endless babble,It just gets tiring after you have heard about 15 seconds of the song and the vocals aren't very good!
5,A Good Addition to any Final Fantasy Collection,I wasn't sure about this soundtrack at first with the game being a shooter rather then the traditional RPG but I was really amazed how awesome the ablum was. Difianlty worth buying!.
3,"A fine book, but an insider's book.","Taylor has written a fine book, but a book almost written for insiders of the 101st Airborne Divison (which Taylor is). I am fortunate to have served with the Screaming Eagles and therefore have the insider's knowledge of how the division operates. Without this first hand experience, I think I would have been lost reading this book. Taylor also spends a great deal of time with the aviation units of the division and scant little time telling the reader how all the division's units deployed, trained and fought the war. This is particularly true about the infantry (but in the interests of full disclosure, I must admit that I am an infantryman and so I'm baised)."
1,Booooring!,"As a member of the 101st Airborne Division,I was really looking forward to reading this book. I wanted to get some sort of insight into how the soldiers fought this war. The book focused entirely too much on the officers and 1/101st. I work in aviation & I know that there can't be too much that's interesting about that branch. What about the NCOs and enlisted guys that made everything happen? That's who the author should ave focused on. It took me months to finish reading this book, primarily because of the poorly written content. Don't waste your money on this piece of ""literature."""
2,Disappointing,"Two fo the twelve designs are for a Puppy Fez and a Collar Cuff (scarf for the dog) and things I would never make for any dog. There are really only 3 sweater designs in this book, all knit flat and seamed up. The others are variations of these three patterns using a different stitch pattern in a few but mostly just color choices.I really wish my local library had had this book so I could have looked through it before spending $ on it. It's not worth $14 for the one pattern I'd actually use."
5,St. Joseph's Sunday Missal,I love the Sunday Missal. It's very easy to read and allowes me to read the lesson before Sunday. It's just the right size to carry in some of my purses and take to Mass to follow along with the readings. The zipper keeps it from getting soiled. I would highly recommend it if you like to follow the Sunday Mass.
3,LARGE PRINT - come on,I have the weekday missals and decided to go with upgrade on the Sunday missal because of the LARGE PRINT. The book is got a great cover better than the weekly. However the print is not much bigger. Thankfully I am not hard of sight. After buying the 2 weekday missal and the Sunday missal I wish I just got a subciption to Magnificat. However I these will suffice. I just wish they didn't advertise large print when its not.
3,Not the 3rd edition missal to go into effect October 2011,"Despite the description for this missal, this is not the new missal to be used by Catholics in late 2011.The missal itself is very well made. I'm not a fan of the zipper as it seems to be always getting mixed in the pages, but that's a minor quibble. The book is a handy size to carry with you or fit in a purse, it has lots of 'extras' like the rosaries, Stations of the Cross, Catholic Prayers.Overall, if this was the latest version, I would give it 8/10 stars. As it isn't, there isn't much point in buying this version as it's only going to be used for a couple more months."
4,Nice missal,"This was a Christmas present for my father. It said large print..well, that is a bit mis-leading because the book is smaller, so the ""larger"" print kind of evens out. Over-all a nice quality, love the zippered cover, and is up-to-date. Would have given it a 5 easily if it had larger printing."
2,"Nice quality, too hard for me","I like the workmanship. This is a good quality seat. I found it to just be way too hard for me. One reviewer said it moves with them. It didn't move at all. Too stiff and also it is so close to the rails, that I had a hard time installing it."
2,Very enjoyable!,"Robert Blake is cute as a button in this film! He's sexy with that ever-present unlit cigarette either dangling from his lips or being held in his hand. His wit is charming, too! In one scene, he and Elliott Gould's characters are undercover in a gay bar and they decide they'd better dance together so as to not blow their cover; after a few moments of slow dancing Robert quips something about ""hey, I think I'm starting to like this...""! Cute movie with a lot of action."
2,"""Busting"" is a bust","This 1974 starts off well with a [good] scene in the dentist's office, but it's downhill from there. The theme seems to be that the system doesn't work, but the film's makers don't carry it off very well. Allen Garfield is good as the bad guy, but you have to be a devoted Elliot Gould or Robert Blake fan in order to enjoy the film."
4,Surprisingly good album,"Most people know Maceo for his big singles, ""Nextel Chirp"" and ""Ho Sit Down."" However if you are expecting just another generic crunk sound from an Atlanta native, you will be in for a surprise. Although he's not even 20, he has legit talent. The songs that really got my attention were the slow, emotional songs, ""The Struggle"" and ""God's Soldier"", which are amazing tracks that display Maceo's musical diversity. ""So Get High"", which is very reminiscent of Bone Thugs, is a great smoking song and ""Mind Frame"", ""Ladies and Gentleman"", and the intro ""Sraight out da Pot"" are nice riding songs. A few of the songs are filler but don't sleep on this guy, get this now."
2,what the heck,mane this dude is so weak mane .....he only prove one thing everybody from the a is not bumpin.....its too weak this need to be his first and last cd...but that nextel song is st8....
3,Nextel,I only heard the Nextel song on this CDit's actually tight great beat . I've heard thats the only straight song he has ever had.
3,Okay book,"Bombs in the Backyard focuses primarily on atomic bomb testing with most of its focus on the [[Wikipedia:Nevada Test Site]]. Its strengths lie in detailing how said testing, specifically radiation, affected not only the health of military personnel, but those downwind of the atomic blasts (including livestock). The second half of the book focuses on how the government, specifically Pentagon and the [[Wikipedia:Atomic Energy Commission]] failed to provide various forms of protection and information to those affected by the testing, and how the courts and federal government mostly fail to compensate the victims of atomic testing. The book was originally penned in the late 1980's."
2,Spotty overview of continental testing.,"An uneven book that tries to cover a wide range of issues and topics, but does so in most cases only superficially. Some topics seem to be well researched, while others seem to have been thrown together on the fly. There's very little new in this book, which is of interest only for its perspective, which is not vehemently anti-testing."
3,another tinted bulb,i'm done with tinted bulbs. these are brighter than others on the market but it's still just another tinted bulb that robs you of useable light.
1,Nice idea... bad product.,"This product does not work very well. I installed it in two different houses, on three different computers, tried all the fine tuning options, chanels, and troubleshooting tips in the manual. And it never looked even close to good.This device adds a good bit of static and interference to the video and audio. (yes, i unplugged my wireless router and cordless phones....) It even makes your monitor look fuzzy. At the advice of one of the other reviews I saw here, I even tried a different vga cable. The vga Y cable they include seems to increase the issues. With a different cable, its slightly better but not quite usable. If you plan to use your computer on the television (or just read documents), forget it. Text is so bulry its very hard to read.If all you want to do is stream a movie to your tv... And you don't mind some static... then this might work for you."
4,Installed in about 5 minutes without a problem,"Installed in about 5 minutes without a problem. Audio and video quality is acceptable with ""out of the box"" settings."
1,Pure Hype,As some comments have been made the positive ones must have come from the vendor. I hooked this up but display on TV scrolled and was fuzzy and gray. Support from the vendor was non-existent. Sent back for a return would never purchase from them again.
2,Partially Useful,"I bought this as my first dictionary as I was learning the language. When I actually got to Croatia, I showed it to the native speakers (college students), and they pointed out more than 20 mistakes in as many pages.Other than that, I did find that the grammer portion (in the front) was helpful, and I do still refer to that quite often.Use this book as a rudimentary reference. For a more comprehensive dictionary to English, I suggest Langenschiedt's."
5,superb,Loved it. Now here is a group celebrating their 30 years of performing. Somehow they have not lost their energy and originality. The songs were wonderful and makes me want to listen over and over. You can't go wrong with this. The Gaelic blended in with English makes RunRig what they are. Truly a great great group.
1,A shoppers guide for the big buck builders.,"I bought this book by mistake. I was looking for the ""Big Twin High Performance Guide"" from which this title uses a great deal of ideas.Absolutely no technical help to do it yourself.If you want a book with more technical information and some ideas of how to do your own tuning try the ""Big Twin High Performance Guide"" by D. William Denish instead."
3,Handy at half the price,"I enjoyed thumbing through the book, but it wasn't the technical resource I was hoping for. This is a fairly general book in the fashion of those old Hot Rod, Peterson Publishing books. Still, it does give you a general idea of how much effort might be ahead of you before you dive into a project - and to that end, it has a certain utility. I've been trying to decide whether to return to the Harley fold, but this book is geared more for those who are better a slinging plastic than turning wrenches. If you're wondering how to split your bike's cases this ain't the book; however, if you want the address (or the author's enthusiastic endorsement) of someone who can, then it's reasonably useful. There are lots of enjoyable shaggy dog stories, but it's pretty light on substance."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"I bought this for my daughters thinking it would be fun to play while they were running around the house playing, it was inexpensive enough. Well, you get what you pay for! The sound quality was horrible. It sounds like someone taped it from a record..with scratches and all. Some parts are extremely low and you could barely hear a thing while other parts were very high. Don't waste your money on this one."
4,great shoe for indoor court,it is a well ventilated shoe for air circulation during the play....quite comfortble....worth the money....
3,"Cheap, But Not the Best","The shoe was extremely cheap; however, it lacks a sufficient lower sole, but does have a thick foam-like bottom. I would recommend the other Reebok Match Point, which comes at the same price but at a much higher quality."
2,Pure Country Charley,"I am very disappointed in this CD. I can tell it is not an orginal by the way it sounds, the about used on the CD. I listen to her all the time and this is not a good cd copy. I ordered the real one not some copy. What happened to honesty???? If I had the money I would send it back but I dont, so I am stuck with a sucky copy."
5,Hits home!!,"Could someone please help me find Charlie McClain and Mickey Giley's ""The Phone Call"", I have searched and searched. HELP!!"
5,Very good classic country music,"This is a very good classic country album. If you like pure classic country,you willlike this album.Charley has a very good voice and sound to her music. Even if youhave heard it or not, you will enjoy this CD. Its definitly worth the money for amusic fan."
1,Bad DVDs,"(9/8/12) - Purchased from Malelo and Company, Taiyo Yuden DVDs, thought they were best DVDs made. But first one off top was bad. (9/10/12) - 2 out of 3 bad. Zero stars for Taiyo Yuden."
5,excelent and the price is right,"I have used these dvds for a few years now. I dont print on them so i cant say how they hold up in that respect, however i usually burn at 8x and out of a few hundred dvds i have had fewer then 10 not burn properly. With the two day shipping and the price you cant go wrong. As long as the price doesnt change ill continue buying these in the future."
3,History of Africa,"This book is an incredibly detailed chronicle of Africa. My travels to this great continent inspired me to learn more of its history. My desire was to obtain a greater general knowledge of the ""cradle of man"" and trace human origins in relationship to cultures, migrations, et cetera. Although I feel that this book is a brilliant work, it is superfluous with detail and exceeds my personal wants or needs. I tend to get lost in the constant infinite details of this book. It is a 'hard read'. The book is a scholar's delight of ad infinitum names, places, and events which I cannot possible retain."
3,Surprisingly good low-budget samurai time-travel,"A samurai rescues a lady, but in the process, is stabbed and thrown into freezing water when he fails to kill a defeated foe. He is frozen until the 20th century, when he is thawed out by scientists. He winds up in modern-day Los Angeles with a young and beautiful female expert in Japanese culture. There are the expected ""fish-out-of-water"" scenarios, and a few more interesting ones, such as the sushi chef who tries to speak with him and says he speaks with a strange dialect, and must be nuts. conflits of interest regarding the samurai bring the story to a climax where he is forced to make a similar choice as he had in the past.The technical production quality is not first-rate, as if this was done on a low budget with low-end equipment. But the sincerity of the production comes through and makes the film surprisingly watchable."
5,hand surgery,"gave my other book as a gift to someone, then decided that I would look for another. Book is in great condition, love the illustrations, great as a teaching method, even though written several years ago. Very happy with my purchase. Thanks, Amazon. Never thought that I would be able to find one."
5,"Back before DMB, there was PDP!","Simply put, this is one of my all-time favorites. The irony is that for such a happy-sounding cd, so many of the songs are about death! Poi Dog Pondering, in their earlier days at least, featured a wonderfully earthy style that fused together all kinds of roots music. The lyrics were wonderfully crafted - ""If I should die in a car wreck, may I have Van Morrison on my tape deck!"" Their concerts were downright festive, with happy fans packed-in chest-to-chest, dancing the night away. You owe it to yourself to add this cd to your collection."
2,secular humanism... snooze,"The music sounds nice and happy, otherwise this would get one star. ""U-Li-La-Lu"" is about the only song on here that I ever want to hear again. The lead singer sounds like he's wearing a clothespin on his nose. The lyrics are narrow-minded, naive, and annoying: ""this great big world is for everyone"" indeed. This CD is probably great if you have an over-idealistic, socialist worldview. Oh yeah, and you should be an atheist."
3,Beware of the different versions of this title,"I bought a copy of this CD thinking that it was simply another compilation CD of '60s and '70s pop hits. I knew that I had another CD in my collection that had the same title but I discovered that this version is a later (1998) release of the original Columbia Legacy Records comp (the yellow colored artwork CD). The only reason I'm downgrading my rating of this CD is due to the COMPLETE lack of liner notes in this version. The original CD release had VERY detailed liner notes (18 pages), so if those things matter to you, be sure to buy the Columbia Legacy (CK 46160) version."
1,VHS to DVD,"Instructions are not detailed much! I thought I would get everything I would need in the box to transfer my VHS to DVD, I ended up having to buy other needed items, still couldn't understand how to set up the VCR, computer and the connections. Then I bought another program which gave detailed info and sucess with 2nd product!I wish there were a way to contact the seller and ask questions about a product before a purchase!"
2,Limited Use,"Product installed after 3 tries,then found it will not work with Capture Device (Instant DVD -ADS) ,tech suppord called & said it would only work with their Capture Device -Poor Product"
1,Not what I expected,"You can only leave one 20 sec message, I thought you could at least leave a dozen or so. Bought this for my mom and it's useless."
3,Board Too Small,"I bought this game at a Thrift Store for one dollar. It looked brand new making me think it might not be so fun. But, my husband and I play it and think it's okay. No thinking involved and no property cards to keep track of! The board is WAY to small, though. I think with small hands not being so careful it could be a big problem. Everything is crowded together. The Chance cards are very small and thin making it very hard to pick them up. The movable princesses are just printed on cardboard that don't stay in their plastic stands. Those are way too big, also. A slimmer plastic version of the princesses, even if not painted, would have been a big improvement. Overall this is a fun game to play and not too complicated."
1,"Cheap, paper knock off of the real game","We bought this for my daughter thinking it was the Monopoly style, just using princesses. We were very wrong. The pawns are actually paper (you punch them out of a card) and stuck into little plastic stands. The game board is even cheap paper...and bends very easily, and sometimes even lays flat enough to allow the pawns to stay upright and in the right spaces. This game was destroyed in only a few playings. Don't waste your money on this garbage. Buy a better game that will last for a while."
3,Princess edition Monopoly Jr.,"My daughters really loved the princess concept of the game. The cards are easy to use and the castles are fun to own. The down-side is that the actual game board is too small. When 4 girls are trying to move their pieces around the board it becomes too crowded. Just trying to keep the board steady is a job. If two players land on the same space its hard to keep them both on that space until the next turn. All in all, my daughters and niece ranging from ages 5-9 enjoyed the game. As the game ""helper"" I wish the board were larger and heavier!"
4,perfect intro to board games for 1st grader,My daughter loves this game and it gives her a fun way to practice addition and subtraction and such. For the grown-ups it's nice that a typical game lasts only about 20 minutes or so.
3,"A classic ""hillabilly"" sound","Had to investigate this group after hearing their take on Snoop Dog's ""gin and Juice"". Great listen when you're feeling a little alt country."
4,great back porch vibe,"Really cool stuff. The Gourds are Americana at its best. This disc has a wonderful back porch vibe that begs for a lazy afternoon of Bud and hot dogs from the BBQ. ""Piss & Moan Blues"" and ""Caledonia"" are great. The instrumentation on these tracks is genius. The next disc, Stadium Blitzer clips this by a nose."
5,Stocking Up III : America's Classic Preserving Guide,"This book is a must have for anyone looking to utilize every ounce of produce from a garden, or every pound of meat from their butcher or personal livestock. The applications range from drying and pickling to curing and even fermentation as a means to preserve food. Anyone looking to preserve food the way our forefathers did would be be well advised to pick up a copy and dig in."
3,Radian C9723A Magenta Toner,I had some trouble getting the printer to recognize the cartridge was installed. I had to remove it and re-insert it several times before it worked. It seems to be working ok now...but time will tell.
1,Yawn!,"This is just worth watching in re-runs on Sundance for the chance to see what a Moron Renee Zellweger is, her following Cristiane Amanpour around ""brown Nosing"" not having a clue what is going on, listening to Amanpoiur drone and waffle.What a total waste of time."
4,UNTIL I FOUND YOU,"Simply awesome! Highly recommend THE FOOLS, ANSWER TO MY PRAYER & HALF LIFE OF A HEART. Every songs are terrific, but these three songs will make your heart cry."
5,UNTIL I FOUND YOU,SKIP EWING IS AN OUTSTANDING ENTERTAINER AND ONE OF THE GREAT SONGWRITERS OF OUR TIME. A TALENT LIKE HIS SHOULD NOT BE OVERLOOKED IN THE FUTURE AS IN THE PAST.
4,the ladies always loved jim,"picked up this cd a while ago. was quite impressed with the performance level of the music. there are several very unique renditions of the doors' songs. ""the end"" is especially powerful. definately a good pick-up for any doors fanyou won't be disappointed."
4,"Read it a while ago, but I thought it was OK","If I remember well, the book is supposed to be a fable, and the narrator speaks in a very naive (and self-centered, but that's normal I feel) way. It's not supposed to sound realistic, it just aims at making the reader smile from time to time and then realize there might be more to it than what he/she thought in the beginning.Looks like it was not a great hit in Texas! But the author was only 21 when she wrote the book, and the mere fact that at that age she wrote interesting fiction (instead of the usual mix of personal life and feelings) is interesting.A couple extra comments : 1) it was not short-listed for the Goncourt Prize 2) talking about Jerry Lewis and France is about as true and relevant as saying that Maurice Chevalier has been on top of the US charts for the last 70 years!"
2,Slop Stories,"Read this 4 or 5 years ago. Didn't get ""it"". Way beyond my capacity to interpolate from reality to suspended disbelief. The characters are not intelligent, appealing, or funny. On the other hand, I found War and Peace to be just another Harlequin Romance. Not particularly fond of unfounded theories based on authors' fantasized insight...unless they are my own. I give this book kudos for being only slightly longer than this critique."
4,Good product,Although the price is a little high the stand is well made. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a very clean modern look.
4,TV Stand,"We bought this TV stand to place behind our media center and to keep our 46"" TV out of our kids' reach. Its base is low enough to slide under the stand (the base is around 2"" in height). It works well and the cable management system holes are large enough to place both our HDMI cables and a few wires through it. We do not use the included glass shelf because of the media stand.Also, it can be tough to put together because of the paint on the screws. You definitely will need two people to put it together. One other word of warning if you intend to have the base seen, you should put a cloth over the base so if you drop a screw on it, you won't scratch. Finally, before buying the stand go to the Peerless web page to make sure that your TV is compatible with the stand."
5,Good product,"Pricing was the best that I found in stores and online, received in a timely manner & would definitely buy Sandisk product again."
5,Flawless,"Cant really review an m2 memory stick, its small, micro sd is still my favorite, but my sony phone rquires an m2. too bad their expensive."
1,order cancelled by EMartBuyUSA,unknown reason - got emailed 4 days after the order with no explanation of cancellation - yet it is still on Amazon listed as available to sell through EMartBuyUSA. Beware of seller. I would rate this less than 1 star if I could.
5,very pleased,its a very good product i have no problems with it and for the price it was worth coming to amazon for cause i did my homework i found one place that wanted the exact memory card for $70
2,Works great if you must buy a Mem stick micro card but microSD is much better and cheaper!!,"First of all let me say that if you MUST use the Memory Stick Micro format then this is a great card. Sandisk makes the best and this is no exception (with a 5 year warranty).My criticism lies in the fact that this card even exists. The card is very slow to transfer files(compared to micro and mini SD cards) and is relatively expensive. Also this card will not work in all Sony Memory stick devices so if you thought you could purchase it for one device and use it down the road (with an adapter) in other Sony devices you may be out of luck (check compatibility to be on the safe side). With Micro SD cards widely available and much cheaper than this one, the fact that Sony developed this card seems to be to line their own pockets rather than truely innovate.The worst thing about this card is that it only comes with memstick duo adapter and not with a full mem stick adapter so it won't work on most card readers."
4,Works fine for me.,"This product seems to be working fine for me but I still wish that Sony would stop making proprietary formats and just use more standardized ones such as SD, SD Mini, and SD Micro. Honestly I probably wouldn't have gotten my Sony Ericsson phone if it hadn't been a free upgrade from my cell phone company, although no phone really impresses me anymore beside the iPhone and a few phones you can get in Europe or Japan but not here stateside."
2,cheap,"it's a memory stick. it does what it's supposed to do. however, I bought this as part of an x-mas gift for a friend who used it in her sony erricson cell phone. it lasted a year. I bought another one from best buy for x-mas gift this year. My micro memory stick for my cell phone has lasted 5 years...it was from best buy. you get what you pay for."
5,Great value,"It was a good value for the product as it works fine with my phone. The only thing was that the picture was kind of misleading. I thought that it might have came with an adaptar for it, but it doesnt come with one. But definite a good value and it works, so i am happy with this product."
1,no adapter as stated,"I think the title of the review sums it up. This item is pretty much useless to me with out the adapter to upload mp3's to it for my cell phone. Information in description stated there was an adapter included, got it, no adapter...called got exchange which amazon was wonderful about and made it really easy. Got the second one, same exact item. Sent both back and got a refund. Amazon just needs to revise the information about what is included with this. Hope this helps anyone looking at this item. Other than that I'm sure it would work fine."
4,Nice Deal,The card works nicely...It has been 4 weeks since i got it....n it works smoothly...it arrived after 3 days of the order...i am satisfied with the purchase....keep it up...
1,Worked fine for 3 months,"I bought this product 3 months ago and worked fine un til today! my phone won't read any more! or my PC!I'm going to e-mail amazon to see what they can do...I have good experiences with the scan disc brand, so I hope it is just bad luck with this particular item."
5,No complaint,SanDisk memory is always reliable. This is my 3th flash memory from this company. Works well with my SonyEricsson W300.
4,Solid product,"Besides the annoying bubble packaging, I don't have any complaints about it yet. It is a remarkably tiny card (smaller than a SIM card) and it comes with an adapter sleeve."
4,Good product - small storage,"a 1GB card is obviously not worth the effort given the expanded storage that's available now. However, the card still works, and I've never lost any data off of it, so props to sandisk for creating a stable storage medium."
2,Not too good,"As much as I loved Mists of Avalon I can't believe she wrote this. Felt that it was written in a hurry maybe. Someone would go into the kitchen for coffee and bring back tea. I found this true of all the ""light"" books."
3,A Bit Better Than Ghostlight.,"I thought it was better than Ghostlight. But it was still not interesting enough, the only interesting parts were confusing!"
3,not what I expected,"This book was actually co-written by a favorite author of mine so I was surprised by how uneven the story was. While the premise was interesting, I found Winter to be very off-putting."
2,Far fetched,"Anyone that has Occult (hidden or secret) knowledge will see that Ms Bradley either knew very little Occult knowledge or was more interested in spinning a yarn.It's quite possible to create a magickal child (Her term for thought form) as described in the book. The created Thought form is not capable of rational thought, and is also incapable of exceeding it's programming when it was created. A lot of Occultists create thought forms for guardians.Read the book for fun and pleasure but do not expect to gain real occult information because you won'tIf you have questions or comments; E-mail me. Two Bears.Wah doh Ogedoda (We give thanks Great Spirit)"
2,Not great,"I liked the Avalon series a bit, even if the characters were a touch one dimensionsal at times. I did not like this book. The story is very slow and boring...there are a couple of places where things of signifigance actually happen and advance the plot, and the ending is good, but to get to them you have to read 200 pages of Winter's problems. It's just not interesting."
4,Another excellent book from Bradley,"I really liked this book. I got hooked on Bradley/books after reading Mists of Avalon, which in my opinion is the best book by Bradley. I really enjoyed this new series of books about magic and everyday life so to say. Enjoy!"
3,Not MZB's best...,"...but not her worst, either. I haven't read any of the other titles in this series, so I didn't know what to expect. MZB's output has varied wildly in quality from brilliant to disastrous, and I was ready for this to go either way. For me, this sat smack in the middle.I wasn't overwhelmed by the characters. Perhaps it is that our main character, Winter Musgrave, is part-amnesiac and terrified through the first third of the book, but it was very difficult to get comfortable with her. Once we have some idea what is happening to her it is easier to dig in. I think that MZB has an interesting premise with this one, and I think the ""why"" of the mystery is well thought out. However, (note: I am trying to avoid any spoilers, otherwise this might be more coherent) I think Winter's eventual visit to her family serves only to introduce characters for another novel and doesn't seem structurally significant, and the ending did not satisfy."
3,Very Good Western,Victor Mature at his best. Good acting by the supporting cast with s decent believeable plot about the Old West.
2,Garbage-don't waste your time and money,"I find this book completely useless. I am giving it 2 stars because the title is catchy and the cover is well designed. Other than that, there is very little meat in the book. You're better off browsing the web for more coherent information. The author has a 2 inch page margin, gives a lengthy summary at the end of each chapter (most chapters are under 3 pages!!) with little or no value. Sorry Dr. Boykin...just my opinion."
1,I rate this 5 stinky diapers--just dreadful!!!,"The Mozart selections are pleasant enough--light, romantic standards that most people will probably recognize. It's the recordings that are positively dreadful! I am all for playing Mozart, and classical music in general, for my baby (whether or not it helps his development). But why make his introduction into the rich and luscious world of classical music so utterly bland? These have to be some of the worst renditions of Mozart ever created. They are painful to listen to and should not be your baby's first exposure to classical music. This is the only one of the ""Mozart Factor"" CDs that I've heard, but I would seriously investigate whether the other recordings are as awful as this one before I purchased any of them."
3,Good Enough,"This book was good enough, or at least better than nothing, but considering the excitement of the topic it could have been written in a MUCH more engaging manner. The sentences are short and choppy and the whole narrative is just a bit blah. It didn't even mention that Helen was ""the face that launched a thousand ships."" How can you tell the story of the Trojan war without mentioning that?Overall, though, it was a good way to tell the story to my first grader. I'll still keep my eyes open for a more exciting version."
4,The kids loved it,"Although it is written in a more no-nonsense, simplistic,and factual style than many other books on the topic, my kids (ages 6-12) were enthralled. They talked about it constantly for many days after."
4,Great Gift for Young Readers,"This book is a very special collection of letters that are inspiring, funny, and touching. Great for reluctant young readers and avid kids as well - they will love reading the words of other young readers!"
5,Unexpected Treasure,"I just today received the Grandes Figuras cd on which Beni de Cadiz is featured. I ordered the disk after having only heard a few samples of his singing. I knew it would be good. I did not know it would be divine!- and I do not use that word casually. As one who has recently become addicted to Flamenco music, I have been trying to catch up on who is (was) who. The number of samples and songs that I have listened to within the past few years borders(?) on the insane. I currently have (only) about 35 Flamenco cds covering a variety of singers from Pepe Marchena to Porrinas de Badajoz to Juanito Valderrama, Antonio Mairena and Paquera de Jerez, but I absolutely adore this one above and beyond anyone else that I have heard."
1,I would not buy this item,"I am not sure why this DVD is titled Christmas special, there is nothing about Christmas on this DVD. It appears to me that they are episodes snatched from the Saturday morning cartoon. I would not buy this if you are looking for a Christmas special. However, if you are one of the ones that watched this when it was on Saturday morning and you thought you wanted the series on DVD, this is a good DVD to buy. I decided against buying any more because the serious was not quit like I remembered."
5,fun movie!!!!,"this is such a cute movie, we loved watching it and will watch it again!!!! all the ""littles"" shows are wonderful!"
2,"Nice pockets, but loud, stiff back","The back of this pouch sounded like a stiff waterproof jacket fabric and made noise everytime I moved. I had to exchange it for the all silk or fabric type. The 3 individual pockets and price were nice, too bad it was loud and stiff."
3,Good product but could use improvement in one area,"I've used this pouch many times over several years and it has held up well. I like and make use of the three separate pockets as it helps keep things organized and easy to reach. My only complaint is that if you stuff it with enough content to put some weight on it, the neck strap starts chafing against the skin on the sides of your neck after a day or two. It doesn't take all that many credit cards, auto insurance cards, players cards, membership cards, medical cards, documents, cash, etc. to add up to a quarter-pound or so. I wish the pouch came with a wider, softer, perhaps even cushioned, strap. Other than that I'm surprized how well the pouch has taken all the abuse I've given it over the past three years. Good quality product."
5,international travel,A very good product. It worked very well during my 5 week journey to Turkey and Germany.
2,"Traditional Gospel, but a bit sloppy","This CD was recorded in 1996 and is closer to his Gospel Favorites CD in style than it is to his excellent The Troublemaker CD. The production is very simple, piano, guitar, organ, and Willie's voice. Willie's voice is starting to show his age and the guitar work seems a little sloppy in places. Even though some of the songs can be found on other CDs, these are all new performances and not just re-issues of older material. It is an ok CD but out of his 4 Gospel CD's, (The Troublemaker, Gospel Favorites, and Old Time Religion) this is the weakest one. I would recommend any of those CDs before this one."
5,One Lesson that Touched Many Hearts....,"This book does a wonderful job at touching on the many different levels of love -- the love you have for your mate, the love you have for your children, the love you have for your parents, the love you have for humanity, and the love you have for God. It reveals love in its purest form.My Sunday School class was doing a study on ""Dealing with Adversity through Love"" (focal passage: I Cor 13) when I stumbled across this book, and it fit in perfectly. I took it in and gave my whole lesson from it! By the end of the lesson, I was taking orders from people in the class who wanted the book, so I had to buy a bunch of copies for the class!I highly recommend this book for anyone, at any stage of love. A must for those contemplating marriage!"
3,Dreaming About Another Chance?,"Most reviews of this movie rate it as a real ""stinker"". Most of the ""acting"" doesn't rate at all ... and you need to keep an open mind when viewing this one. The scenery is absolutely wonderful, the story is actually delightful - with many moments of great humor - including Mr. Trump's appearance. Maybe the plot isn't deep, but all of you ""critics"" out there who do nothing but criticize from your reality's point of view need to realize that it's okay to have movies produced that are light and entertaining."
4,Very brief - might be good for review of game theory,"This is a very short book and is supposed to be an easy read. It mostly is, but some of the parts required a bit of mathematics so I had to skip them (the part on differential games - requires optimal control theory).Some explanations were way too brief, but I guess if you knew the material from before it would be a useful quick review.Overall, it is a nice book with many interesting examples. But it might be a good idea to combine it with a book that explains more of game theory: try ""Game theory for applied economsts"" by Robert Gibbons or something more general and non-technical like ""Moral Calculations"" by Laszlo Mero."
4,super catchy melodies,"This is a solid debut release. The tracks evoke good 80's and early 90's alternative music, without being derivative. ""The Ties That Bind"" has a guitar line that reminds me of My Bloody Valentine. ""My Little Sun"" reminds me of The Cure crossed with Luna. Strange, but it works.I think what is astounding about this is that that all of this was done by one single person, yet it sounds like a full band. Pretty damn cool."
1,Be sure that you TEST this using lower mgs first!,"This will cause extreme flushing and if you have not had niacin before, it may be very scary. Actually the product itself is probably fine - just need to be sure that you build up to 500 mg before you start out on this product"
3,Flush = BURN,"Bought these after reading some compelling evidence to add niacin to my diet. I heard that the ""flush"" types were more beneficial, so I tried these and WOW! I had intense whole body ""flushing""! it was itchy and very uncomfortable. I stuck with it for a few days and got used to the flush, but i quit taking them because i didn't notice any benefit."
1,My opnion of vitamin. B3,"After I took the first or second one my legs starting itching from my knees to my ankles. It was so intense, I couldn't sleep. I went though my medicine cabinet and tried everything that was supposed to help itching, but nothing did any good. I looked at the bottle and it said Caution"" flushing, itching,rash or gastric disturbances may occur. . If there is a possibility that anyone could be allergic, it should be put in the advertising. It should put all of the terrible things that could happen, not just a caution that flushing, itching or gastric disturbances may occur."
1,3000 mg - Still not flush - It doesn't work!,I bought Niacin to obtain a flush for health reasons. I took 3000 mg and still no flush. I think the capsules are full of something other than Niacin. Completely ineffective.
1,NO THANKS!!!!!,I'm sure it has great benefits but I will NOT take this again! I take lots of vitamins and decided to add this into my routine. About 30 minutes after taking this I started feeling hot then REALLLLLY hot like I was literally sitting on a campfire. My entire body was red with patches and itchy. I felt like my face and chest were on fire and swelling. I read that this is a very normal side effect but it scared the daylights out of me and I am not taking it again!
5,Great product for Niacin cholesterol therapy,"These capsules are easy to take and much cheaper than my co-pay for Niaspan or other alternative true Niacin products. They are 500mg and I take one in the morning and one mid-evening. There is occasionally some ""flushing"", but it is minimal when these are taken on a relatively full stomach. Some research seems to indicate that without at least some flushing effect, niacin may not be doing much (or as much) to lower cholesterol, so I don't mind the brief discomfort (much like a 'hot flash'). I like the fact that with this product I only take two capsules per day. At our local, larger grocery stores, I can't find anything other than 100mg niacin, so I had been taking 10 of those a day (5 morning, 5 evening) for the same dose. These 500mg are very inexpensive through Amazon and I highly recommend them for availability, quality and price."
2,bad flush,"ok as far as the quality of this product I would say its very good but this will flush you bad. I have tried several different ways, with food (not as bad a flush), opening the caplets and taking in water (not to bad if you only take half at first then the other half a few hours later. the flush seems to be erratic also when taking with food. Took one once then went shopping about 3 hours later and in the middle of the store had a major flush attack. I'm afraid I had to throw this stuff out and by a no-flush brand. I am sure it varies depending on the person taking one but i gave my girlfriend one once and she started freaking out really bad saying it felt like her whole body was on fire and she wanted to go to the emergency room. I kept her calm and kept supplying her with cool clothes till it subsided about 40 min later. needless to say it scared her so bad she wont even try the non-flush brand now."
2,Too Much Flushing,"Not an extended release and warning says may cause flushing but of all the B3 supplements I have used the flushing and itching is the most pronounced . I have used B3 more more than 5 yearsI will not buy this product again and am immediately throwing out 1 unsealed bottle and another with 80 capsules remaining .The best I have found on Amazon is 21st Century Niacin 500 Mg Flush Free Capsules, 110-Count"
4,Good DVD,Laura's 21st Century Pilates - IntermediateI enjoyed this DVD very much! I do it about once per week in my rotation of other Pilates DVD's. I really felt the workout. I like her a lot. She seems to really care about helping people to reach their goals. The background is peaceful. Good stretches as well. I think this DVD is worth the investment.
5,Excellent complete walking system,"This three tape set starts you off slow and easy, great for beginners. It gives you choices in the length and intensity of your workout.Tapes two and three work you up to a full scale workout with intervals. terrific fat burning workouts. The music keeps you moving at the right pace.Teaches form first, then speed.Excellent for outdoor walking or treadmill workouts."
3,Good but...,"The quality is fine, the delivery was exceptional--it just did not have the type of music I was expecting, inasmuch as it had vocals I had not anticipated. Not bad at all, just not what I expected."
2,Fair,"I recently received my paratrooper fatigues, and tried them on. The right hand pocket didn't feel right, and on closer inspection, I saw it was stitched incorrectly. I had them altered and the pocket re-stitched. I don't want to return them. They are made in China. Workmanship is not good."
4,XL A LITTLE TOO ROOMY,"Had to return these cause the were too big. The company was real good about the exchange. Pants are well made and seem durable. Will work perfect for what I had in mind. Would recommend, even at this price."
1,Crap,"This movie is such crap. Save your money, you will thank me later. Nothing about pool. Its a women who wants to get her kid and go to canada. DO NOT GET if you want a movie about pool playing."
1,Embarrassing...and a waste of good talent..,Famke Janssen.Rip Torn.Great character actors.It's all here with the exception of a decent denouement.Decent! Say rather proper.You don't titilate the audience with a good storyline and then pull out the rug. For no viable reason.The last minutes of this production are so silly and dumb that it borders on the ridiculous. If you listen to the Director Commentary it becomes even more mundane and foolish.A bad shot for cinematic entertainment.Judge for yourself.
4,"take it as is, and enjoy.","i must be one of the few who actually thought this was a noble effort for first time director Eigeman. Nevermind that i think Famke is always beautiful, always watchable, but consider that take away the pool shark credo and this could be any desperate mother trying. It didn't win any oscars but it also didn't have that slick happy ending...thank Chris for that! I think what i appreciate most is that he doesn't paint Famke as desperate and the kid doesn't come off as clueless or naive. Worth a look."
1,"Good potential, terrible ending","Don't waste your money. This film wasn't developed enough (it's only 92 minutes, that's about the length of a children's cartoon movie), and so none of it makes any sense when it just---ends. I've been scanning the Internet trying to figure out the ending. Does she live? Does she die? And what's with the final scene anyway????Famke Janssen is a great actress, but her character never gets developed enough in order for you to decide what to think of her. Compulsive gambler mother is better than alcoholic abusive husband?? Dunno.Frankly, I didn't get it. I""m glad I saw it for free."
3,Turn the River,"Great acting. Awesome pool shots. Depressing and disconnected storyline.Illogical ending that punished the audience and the main character.Question: Why did the main character almost succeed with her plan to raise her son, only to be shot by a cop who was not threatened by her in any way? Hopeless and disconcerting.Geo S"
1,Not the correct size for the i355!!!!!!!!!,"This battery is too narrow for the i355. It works, but sometimes shifts positions inside the phone causing the phone to loose power."
1,Stopped working after a month...,I bought this battery for my mom and she said that it stopped charging after a month of using it.
4,small wonder: the complete first season,as a kid who grew up in the 80s im a huge fan of anything in movies and tv coming from that decade so i cant wait to get this set
1,Makes Punky Brewster Look Like Citizen Kane!,"If you enjoy bad retro televison then you will enjoy this. This has it all: bad scripts, bad acting, & bad production values.If you are looking for escapist crapulence....you've just hit the jackpot!!!However, in truth, I must say that the show definitely had one thing going for it: the series had a very simple innocence, and espoused strong moral teachings in many of the episodes. However; if you are looking for TV with family values, there are many other series like the Waltons, Little House on the Prarie, or Seventh Heaven that can amply supply all of the wholesome goodness you are looking for, minus the low production quality that rivals only Telemundo for schlockiness!"
3,"My wife really likes it, but . . .","I don't like this very much. The kids are cute, but the story line just bugs me a bit. The girl who plays the robot never develops more human characteristics, just robotic, and it winds up being a little creepy after awhile. There are alot of good things about the show, but only three out of five."
1,A work of unmitigated genius,"If only they would release it on bluray!Are you people high? This show makes ""Full House"" look like Shakespearean theater in the round. My mom put my grandma in a home after she told her this was her favorite show. I remember her remarking, ""Oh, the things that robot says!"" You five star givers best be glad I am not in charge of your golden years."
1,HERE COME THE FOUR HORSEMAN!,"I give up!!! I swore that if this show was released on DVD before all of "" Leave it to Beaver"" became available there was no hope for anything of quality to look forward to in the future of T.V. on D.V.D. We still wait for the rest of Bob Newhart, Mary Tyler Moore, Dynasty ,Peyton Place, Knot's Landing, Marcus Welby and The Lucy Show .Keep this piece of junk and wait for the end."
5,The Good ole' days!,"Now that I have kids of my own, I want them to see what real ""family"" television was like. There's nothing on T.V. today that compares to Small Wonder,Punky Brewster and many others. Hurry up and make this a DVD!!!"
5,Finally on DVD with great BONUS EXTRAS!,"Vicki the Robot! If anything good came out of syndication, this is the show! It was a unique story of a family that invents a robot to be their daughter. Eventually, the robot develops human feelings. This beauty of a gem is finally available on DVD! (First season so far.)You probably already know about the show so let me tell you about he extras. Usually, if there are commentaries on episodes. over TV DVDs will only have commentaries on 1 episode. There are 5 episodes with commentaries! Dick Christie, Marla Pennington and Jerry Supiran comment on all 5 and Edie McClurg and others contribute to several of them, too. I will say, Dick Christie's voice level is not loud on the commentaries. Hopefully this will be corrected in Seasons 2, 3, and 4.Marla Pennington's comments are very sweet. Jerry Supiran could use some more pep in his voice when commenting. The legendary Edie McClurg is funny as ever.Buy this set now and you will not be disappointed."
4,Wonders of amazement,"This would be such an amazement to this come to DVD. I've had episodes taped for nearly, a decade and a half. But don't have all of them. It would be truly to see them in their entirity, of full complete four-run seasons."
5,This show is better than I remember!,I LOVE this show!!! My kids are glued to it too:) Is there a second season??
1,A terrible television show!,Why would anyone want to buy this on DVD? This show is terrible. I still have nightmares from watching this show. Please don't put this on DVD.
3,Hmmm ...,Not as funny as I remembered. Never actually finished watching the shows. I will one day. Vicki is still pretty cool and the red head neighbor is so cute.
5,creative scores again!,"this is my second creative mp3. my first (the zen nano plus) lasted over 2 years through rain, sweat, dirt (trail running). i searched high and low to see if there was anything better for running and did not find it. the flash memory is perfect for the jarring it takes. it has an optional belt clip (i hate the arm thingy). it's the smallest thing out there that's not an i-something. i got the 2gb this time. the technology has improved since my last purchase and while it won't shuffle between folders, each folder will now hold 500 songs. the headphones still suck and are obviously not made for runners so i'm using some from sony that have more comfortable earbuds. i love that i just pull it apart & it is it's own usb to my computer. so easy. no wires. also, i love the fact that it uses 1 AAA battery. no recharger necessary. one battery lasts a long time even for 5-6 hour training runs. it's a great product and a huge value for the money."
5,EXCELLENT VALUE,"Great for simple-minded people who don't want to deal with larger video-based mp3 players. I bought this about a month ago and use it when I jog. I had to buy my own case for it, but I am satisfied with a cheap one I bought from CaseLogic. As for the player itself, I have found the built-in USB drive extremely convenient, as I can add or subtract music anytime and anywhere I am near a computer. The sound is just fine for a jogger who needs background music, but I haven't compared it to any other player. It's definitely a big step over my Rio player, which broke and needed software AND a cord (no good). I would suggest this player to anyone who wants a good value for their money, and doesn't necessarily need/want a top-of-the-line product."
5,LOVE IT,"Bought it for my wife and she loves it. It keeps track of where you were and restarts from there. The display is small (no fancy menus like Ipod)but works well. Sound is excellent.Be sure to install the drivers and software. The software is small, simple and EASY to use - or you can just COPY/PASTE files onto it.If you DON'T install the drivers it only works at USB 1.1 speeds and takes a LOT longer to load songs. With drivers you get full 2.0 speeds."
4,good basic mp3 player,"I bought this player to listen to audio books and listen to music while driving to and from work. I really enjoy this player. It doesn't have all of the fancy features of the Apple iPod (e.g., color screen), but it plays audio files and that's the most important feature of all."
5,You could use one of these,"Even if you already own one of those mega-mp3 players, like an iPod, you could still one of these. This is a great little device for the money. Because it is flash-based, it can go many places that you really won't want to take an expensive mp3 player. I have used it while painting my house and while snowboarding. I'm not afraid of hurting it. Even with all the abuse I have given it so far, the device isn't phased in any way. It just keeps chugging along with great sound. The best part about it is that when I want to put a fresh collection of songs on it, I just pull it apart and it becomes a thumb drive! No wires or cords to lose!If you are thinking about getting one, stop thinking and just get it...you will be happy that you did."
1,"Very disappointing, do not buy","I bought this product and it was dead within a month, even though there was absoutely no damage or misuse. WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY."
2,"Thumb drive with a player, nothing more","I purchased the V100 as a very basic player with easy connection and management. Overall, I believe I got just that - the connection is easy, and management is simple file management: copy the files you want. Where it gets interesting is the folder structure; most people organize by folders if they have a library of any size - Artist\Album\<tracks>. This structure CANNOT be copied over to the V100 unless you want to navigate to each directory...which isn't practical. For a 2G unit, this lack of folder capability makes the product unusable as you'll need to navigate your online storage to copy files over, and then lose any type of order on the MuVo...it's just one big pile o' music.If your interest is in a thumb drive with a player, then this is your baby. If you're looking for a portable player that will carry some of your organized library, look elsewhere."
1,disappointed,"I really looked forward to using this product and it has been a real pain from the beginning. It has now died completely and shuts off as soon as I start it, similiar to other reviews. Not sure how much effort to put into fixing, if possible. May just junk it. Be forewarned...piece of junk."
2,It was a bad call,"C'mon - this is ridiculous. I just bought it. Great unit. Reason I bought was for audio quality. Can't use any of my WMA Lossless? If I had realized that, I would've just bought an iPod for the inferior audio quality. Also, it takes forever to upload it."
5,Daughter's got swiped at work.,Daughter had her's plugged into the USB port of her computer at work. Forgot about it and left it there over the weekend. Somebody stole it and she is UPSET! Gave it to her as a Xmas present last year & she totally loved it! Said it downloaded music very quickly and was easy to use. Normally I wouldn't automatically replace a stolen item...but she truly enjoyed this and it costs less than the one I bought last year. I know this will be a welcomed gift!
4,MuVo mp3,"I had bought the smaller Creative Zen mp3 last year and loved it. This one, the MuVo, has great music capacity for the price.Three minor drawbacks though:1. The usb connecter is part of the device & not a separate cord. It is chunky and barely fits beside the other cords on the back of my laptop. I had to angle it in there & try not to disconnect at the same time.2. The Zen comes with a neck cord, the Muvo does not.3. The ear buds are plastic w/o covering & continuously slip out, so I've been using the Zen's earbuds, too.Still, the Muvo is a nice little device. Great sound, easy to use, long battery play."
3,It Will Do the Job,"I personally didn't like the set up and I thought it had small storage space, but it did have a usb connection already on it which was convenient. I have an ipod now and like it better, but the muvo got the job done for a small time."
4,Fine Machine,I purchased this player just for audio books and it works great. When you turn it on it remembers where you were in the book when you last shut if off. Really works nice. Get a good set of headphones for real pleasure. The case is a little flaky. I used some clear book tape to reinforce the joints and it much better. Many hours of play time on one AAA rechargeable battery. I recommend it.
5,"Good MP3 player, Bad Headphones...",The MP3 player is better then expected.. REALLY easy to figure out.. don't really need instructions either..very simple. I recommend it.. but the only thing I didn't like about the whole thing were the headphones.. they're great head phones but the only thing that wasn't great is that one side of the head phone is good.. but the other side is connected to the cord like 3 inches below that one and it's very uneven and uncomfortable.. so I suggest you get different headphones. My sisters boyfriend got the exact same mp3 player like a week before me and he loves it.. but the same thing happened to his headphones... i dont suggest trying to fix them if you're planning on using them either because he broke his.. other then that.. it's GREAT!
1,Creative Muvo V100 2 GB MP3 Player White-Would Not Work !,"I was very dissatisfied with this product because I live in South Carolinaand I bought one of these Creative Muvo V100 2 GB MP3 Player White units for my wifes son in Florida for a Christmas gift and it would not work.Amazon only had a 30 day warranty on it and I bought it in the end ofNovember and it was not opened and tried until after Christmas and it DIDNOT work.In cases like that where the item is not going to even be tried out for a period of time,I should still be able to get it replaced"
4,Do not buy from Antonline,I loved the muvo (when it worked). It only worked (great) for 3 months then conked out on me. The seller would not reply to any of my emails. I will NEVER buy from him again.
2,Declining quality,"I purchased one of the Creative MuVo TX FM 1GB units about two years ago and spent hundreds of hours listening to books on tape and downloaded lectures on it. I loved this thing and when the jog wheel/switch finally gave out, I ordered its successor, the MuVo V100 2GB player. What a difference - they've cheapened the quality of the plastic so that the whole device flexes. I don't care to see light through the gaps in an electric device. I couldn't believe that this unit would last as long as the previous device, so I immediately returned it and ordered another MuVo TX FM. I'm not sure how much longer this older unit will be around, so I may have to order a second as a spare. BTW all of these units have the same multifunction jog wheel/push button switch and it is their one great weak point. Too much stess is put on that one critical piece."
1,If it only had a brain!,"I bought the Muvo V100 by Creative for its ease of use: AAA battery, & drag & drop from Windows Media Player 11. The thought that I would have trouble finding the music on the player never entered my mind. If this thing had a ""brain"" (you know, like a user-friendly folder system?) it would be a very nice product for the price. As it is, I have only one music list that it will play most of its selections. So I will use it occasionally, butafter buying a Cadillac (My Sony NWZ-A818 Walkman, reviewed elsewhere), it's hard to go back to the little red wagon."
4,satisfied with Creative MuVo V100 2 GB MP3 Player,This was an early Christmas gift for my 15 year old son. He wanted it to take on vacation so he had something to listen to other than my Christmas music. He plays it everyday and has really enjoyed it. Reasonable price and plays great!
2,I Returned it: Difficult to find music,"Yes, it's easy to load...........but once the stuff is inside, good luck on finding it...........and no instuctions about how to use it. I called customer support and they weren't particularly helpful. They wanted $14 to have someone walk me through it."
4,"Light, simple and covenient","Once I got the hang of this little device, I was hooked. I use it mostly for foreign language programs. I like the convienience of using standard AAA batteries instead of an internal power source. I switched to rechargeable AAAs so I don't have to keep buying the disposable ones. With 2GBs of memory it's really adequate for my needs."
4,Vastly Improved,"This is my 3rd Muvo player.Things that made me a repeat purchaser:------------------------------------------+ Extremely compact (Roughly the size of a cigarette lighter)+ One handed navigation+ Excellent battery life (About 16-20 hours on a single AAA)+ Crisp, Clear Audio + Customizable EQ+ No cables necessary to connect to a computer+ No need to install proprietary software (Works like a flash drive)Improvements with this model:-----------------------------+ 2 GB Capacity+ Now features lyrics and 'libraries' for organization+ More compact+ More customization options+ Lyrics display (if you're willing to supply the file)Complaints with this model:---------------------------- When you go to skip a folder, it doesn't bring you to the folder that's currently playing, as in previous models, but the very first one in the list. Somewhat annoying.- No key ring attachment (But there are holes to attach a strap)"
5,nice and easy,"This is the second Mp3 of this type that I've owned ( I have two and both still work great) It's nice and compact, and easy to transfer music onto without needing a cable since it works like a flash drive. The interface is great and it also functions as a radio.Three thumbs up:D"
5,Connecting the MuVo 100 to the Computer,"After a whole day of attempting to connect the MuVo 100 to my Dell computer using a USB connector on the Dell front that I use routinely for many peripheral USB connectors, I tried a USB connector on the rear of the hardware case. It worked and everything fell together smoothly. Why? I can't begin to guess.But this MuVo is really neat and loads about as fast as my previous tiny portable MP3 player that died after years of use. The sound is excellent and the size is just right."
5,Great Mp3 Player- easy to load and use,"Easy to load and use Great sound even with supplied earbuds. Plugged the Muvo V100 in the usb slot and xp saw it as a hard drive in 30 seconds. copied and pasted 500 mp3 songs to the Muvo. Very easy. It did take time to upload, but I haven't loaded the Creative cd yet or uploaded any patches. anyway the USB port I have is 1.1 not usb 2. This is not a problem as I don't care how long it takes to upload, Windows is multi tasking so I surf the web, read e-mails, while it uploads.easy enough for even my Dad to use.This is my 3rd generation of Creative flash MP3 Players. I use it riding my Harley. I have 3 years of great music.Creative did it again, I can't wait for the 4 Gig Flash Players to hit the market"
2,Disappointing,"Bought this .mp3 player to replace my Samsung YP-T7J player since it can hold 2X the music and I can replace the battery while the Samsung rechargable lasted only 8 hours on long trips.The problem I encountered when using the Muvo supplied software, it put half the songs in an individual ""folder"" format for each song and the remaining songs in individual .mp3 files without the ""folders"".Problem with this is the player cannot access the .mp3 files in the folders, only the individual ones. I'm at a loss why it does this and cannot access the songs in ""folders"". I tried everything and finally just erased them in the player.I'm not a tech wiz so I might be doing something wrong. Only fact my Samsung never had this problem and is much easier to operate.It's annoying Creative doesn't explain how to properly download files into this player."
2,Creative MuVo v100 is actually USB 1,"People, this is not a USB 2.0 player, which is a shame. Transfer is way too slow for USB 2.0. I am a user of MuVo TX FM for a long time and that was USB 2.0. This is like going back in time for Creative."
4,Almost Perfect,"I had one of the little red Creative MuVo players and I used it constantly for audio books - one right after the other for several years. I also used it when I jogged. Unfortunately I think I left it in a shower room at a campground, so I thought I'd treat myself to another one. This time I got the 2GB white version. Aside from the color... wish it was something other than white, the only thing I dislike is that it did not come with a belt clip. I can not live with an MP3 player without a belt clip and finding a reasonably priced one that will reasonably fit this player has been very difficult. That's a real bummer."
5,Perfect gift ...,This was thee most perfect gift for my husband's birthday.He is a musician & actually bought it along to a 3rd worldcountry we just visited. We had our own tunes !!! Plushe is a 'very' heavy snore-er so I cranked it at night ...no more snortin for me to hear from now on!!!I plan to purchase a blue one for my own taste in music!
3,Good value,"On the pro side: great price for a 2G device. Good sound and battery usage. USB makes it easy to download music to. It uses standard MP3 rather than a proprietary format.On the con side: they say it uses USB2.0, but downloads are slow. There are very few accessories that work with it. I purchased a Belkin device for FM use in my car, and the signal is not stong enough for my car. The file structure on the device is very clumsy.In the end, I'd rather have a device that can be used in more situations because more accessories are available. I may end up buying an iPod anyway, even though I think they gouge the price."
5,"I agree with Susan, should have won a grammy","This is a cd that I have owned since a long time ago and it is amazing and wonderful. I believe it should have won a grammy like Susan stated because Michael Doucet and Beausoleil are better than Dylan and all the other contemporary artists that exist in my opinion. When I hear Dylan I don't lose my breath because of his voice, like Michael can make you do. My advice, buy all the Beausoleil CD's and you will be transported to paradise and Louisiana."
2,Outdated information in a recently released book? Really?,"This book just arrived today, and I anxsiously started leafing through it. I was looking in the section with hotels, and there were several the book mentioned that I wanted to check out. Now here is the confusing part... honestly, ALL four of the websites I went to first were no longer valid. Either squatters had taken up residence on the site, or I got the old ""this page is no longer available"" message. And it's not like I forgot to type the .au or anything, the info was just bogus. I am giving it two stars because I'm sure I will get other good info out of the book. I even kind of expect travel books to have some outdated info, but for a book that was released in 2010 to have the first four websites I try to go to be totally inaccurate is unforgiveable in my mind. I can only assume that they re-released it this year without any fact checking."
3,Needs More,"Just spent a week in Sydney and found the book helpful in terms of the downtown area and Sydney proper. But I really wished it had more in the Outskirts section. There isn't a ton to see in Sydney proper but lots to see on the outer edges, an hour away, etc. Perhaps they need a New South Wales guidebook since the Australia guidebook tries to put too much into it. Anyway - if you're going to spend your whole trip right in downtown, this book works fine. If you get a little antsy for a little more color, keep looking. (And, btw, I usually LOVE Eyewitness travel guides. I have at least 10 others.)"
4,Great!,It matches everything in the in the description. I would have rather had the orange tape only on the tip instead of the sides.
1,Too big and breaks super easily.,"I did not expect this product to be enormous. In 'enormous,' I mean so big that it makes my M4 S-System and JG G3 look small."
5,It is what is says it is,I bought this product to experiment on asthetic looks on other rifles. The product is good quality for what it is intended. You can't beat the price.
5,Really funny,"This is a classic. Really funny movie with some interesting situations and good acting. It's worth owning, especially if you are at all familiar with the experience of expats in a foreign country."
5,Best Coffee!,Love this coffee.We mix it half and half with regular for a great tasting coffee.When you order it online from Amazon you get a great savings from purchasing it at a local store. It ends up being .99 cents a bag. Buy 2 boxes and get free shipping.
5,"Essential Learning, get this book","I had to learn Linux as fast as I could for a promotion for work, this book told me everything. I knew linux in a short time and alot of Linux short cuts too, Many things about the OS that even the interviewing candidates did not know. This book is easy to read, well organized and interesting."
1,"A movie about failing, boredom.","In a movie that ostensibly shows two brothers pushing themselves ""to the limit,"" you get to see a lot of failure, bickering, and no make-up sex! Nothing in this movie gets explained, not the route, not the technique, not who ANYBODY actually is! I'm a very enthusiastic rock climber, but the confusion and lackluster climbing scenes made this film incredibly boring. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, except maybe folks who get off on watching egocentric germans get pissy with each other.P.S. They don't succeed at any goal they set for themselves!"
4,The hiragana are helpful,One thing that makes this a great supplement to the excellent all-audio Pimsleur is that the Learn in Your Car series comes with a booklet that has sentences written out in the latin alphabet and hiragana. It's wonderful to practice reading hiragana with this set when the brute memorization efforts seem intimitating at the beginning.
3,Learn Orchestral Conducting in your Car!,"The product is acceptable for people with a background in spoken Japanese. The audio is clear, even in the tone in the Japanese speaker's voice was mechanical and dull.I lived in Japan for a total of four years and the notion that someone who hasn't heard Japanese or is unaware of Japanese orthography and phonology could ""learn Japanese"" anywhere, using these discs inspires hilarity. This sterile, rote auditory and spoken practice is useful only for a person who wants to keep or extend their foundation in spoken Japanese."
4,Cool,This is a really neat idea. The product looks nice and stores data. It's like being in a spy movie :)
5,Self Discovery,"Jan Forrest's new book, ""Awakening the Spirit Within,"" is an experience of small but exquisite epiphanies of one's self. Every page will help you unravel your own mysery and guide you to a more balanced spiritual self."
3,Wasn't very impressed,"The company got my tie to me well in time, but I can't say I was really impressed with it. I don't know if it's the monitor, the flash from the camera when the picture was taken, but the tie I have seems a much darker green. The material seems a lil flimsy too, but it does match the price (now it I had paid 50 bucks for it then I would have been pissed)."
3,"""Best Pills, Worst Pills""....in their own OPINION.","It became almost immediately obvious to me as I read from this book that the authors are biased to different prescription medications. They trash talk practically all the drugs that are traditionally used to treat anxiety and make them sound evil. Benzodiazapene (anti-anxiety) drugs have been proven safe and highly effective in the treatment of anxiety time and time again. This is the only book I've seen so far that rips on certain medications in this way. (Other than ""Talking back to Prozac"") I closed this book and put it right back on the shelf as soon as I realized this. It's a silly book. I prefer the non-biased, takes-no-sides book on the same subject by Dr. Jim Rybacki. Check it out."
5,Outdated but still very helpful.,"This book is extremely helpful if you are taking multivariable cal, vector analysis, electromagnetism etc. It has many worked out problems in the subject. Nothing like the Schaum's outline. Many interesting non-routine problems."
2,Not durable,cracks too easily. Not durable.breaks easily. this looks nice and supplier is excellent but the product just isn't durable and doesn't hold up to use.
5,A must have for dutch oven owners!!,These stands are of great quality. I have purchased one for every dutch oven I have. I have used them as a stand to cook on an upside down lid. I have also used this inside my dutch oven to cook biscuits. I place it in the bottom and place a pan on top to allow for even heat and air circulation in the oven. All of my dutch ovens are deep and there is plenty of room to use this inside with a pan. It is also nice to have a sturdy place to put your lid. . .no more dirt on the lid. . .no more burnt tables. Worth every penny!
2,Flimsy product,This lid holder will do what you want it to- hold a lid - but you need to use caution. It is wobbly and easily collapsible.
4,very practical,The lid stand for the dutch ovens is very practical. It definitely provides a clean and clear spot to set the lid while checking on the great food in the oven. It let's the kids know to stay clear because the lid will most likely be hot if it is setting on the stand and it keeps the lid off of the ground for the cook.I was surprised that it wasn't made in the U.S.A.
4,Lodge Lid Stand,"Standard lid stand for a Dutch Oven. Almost necessary if you want to cook on the lid of your oven. The metal is thick, and the black finish seems like it will last, however the pin holding the pieces together appears to be made of cheaper metal. 4/5 Stars."
3,"Good Stand, folds up small","This is a good stand and folds up small. It also allows for cooking on the lid which is nice, although I haven't personally tried doing this yet. My main complaint about this stand, however, is that it's made in China so I worry somewhat about the quality of this product over time. I was hoping to stick with the Lodge brand since their cookware is made in the USA, but they have apparently not placed as much focus on their accessories."
2,made in China,"This is the first Lodge product that I have ever seen that came from China. Nowhere near the quality of their regular stuff. Use a rock, rocks are at least American made!!"
3,The rivet in the middle is weak - infinite life once replaced,"This works great, but the center rivet looked extremely suspect to me, so I knocked it out and replaced the assembly with a bolt, washer, and locking wing nut I got at the hardware store for $3-$4. I can't imagine why the maker chose such a poor fastener."
5,Lodge lid holder,Great lid holder to have next to your Camp dutch oven. It keeps my lid from burning the table I set it on. It can also be used with the regular dutch oven to raise up so you can put charcaol under it. I have not used it yet to flip the lid over for eggs and such. It looks very easy to use that way though.
4,Another must-have for your DO cooking gear,"I accidently left mine at home recently and felt lost without it. This provides a clean surface on which to place the lid when stirring. I haven't used it yet to flip the lid over and use it as a griddle but am looking forward to doing so. For me, it's as important as the lid lifter."
4,Good as lid stand. Not so good as griddle stand for the lid.,"This little lid stand does what it is supposed to do just fine. One thing though: I pictured myself using it as a griddle stand and it doesn't work well that way. I was planning to flip my DO lid over, put it on the lid stand over some hot coals and use the lid as a griddle to warm tortillas and cook pancakes. It doesn't work well this way because the ""cross"" in the middle interferes with the handle in the middle of the DO lid. I can now see how cool it would be to have one of the Camp Chef deluxe DOs with the 3 legs on the TOP of the lid for the purpose of using the lid as a griddle."
5,Cookin outside,Was going to get this for my daughter but decoded to get one for myself also. I like how this swings together to make it easy to store.
5,Keeping John Duffey's Genius Alive,"This CD is a retrospective of John Duffey's musical genius; however, I don't agree with the track selections, which tend to focus on John's vocal ability... forgeting his brilliant, irreplaceable mandolin style. A style which is featured in the award winning documentry, ""High Lonesome The Story of Bluegrass Music,"" and in the chapter titled ""Four Bluegrass Greats"" of Jack Tottle's critically acclaimed mandolin instruction book BLUEGRASS MANDOLIN.With all this in mind, why would producer Fred Jasper exclude John's stellar mandolin breaks on, ""Will The Circle Be Unbroken,"" from the Country Gentlemen's début and ""I Know You Rider"" from the Seldom Scene's LIVE AT THE CELLAR DOOR;"" certainly, not only fine examples of John's creativity on the mandolin but also of his showmanship... I guess you'd have to ask Fred."
2,Ok book...,"As one of Jehovah's Witnesses, let me tell you that Donald Kerns is totally wrong with what he said in his review. Ask one of Jehovah's Witnesses, not some person who is not one.As for the book, it's ok, but if you really want all that history, ask one of Jehovah's Witnesses. Im sure they'd gladly tell you what you want to know."
4,"This book is a captivating read, i couldn't put it down.","First, let me state I'm neither a legal scholar nor a Jehovah's Witness. I just like to read different books about different subjects. This book is a great read, very interesting background about the witnesses and the U.S. legal system.I couldn't seem to stop reading and ""had"" to finish this book. Peter's style, although noticeable in the beginning, disappears after about 30 pages and the book becomes totally captivating. To me, this indicates a Very well written book.I would easily recommend Judging Jehovah's Witnesses to friends."
5,Eye-opening Look at USA during the 1940's,"I read this book based on a review in USA Today, but it was not what I had expected. I expected a dull review of multiple court cases, but I was pleasantly surprised by a look at life in the mid-USA during the 1940's through the eyes of Jehovah's Witnesses. I especially liked the fact that Peters included interviews with some of the people directly involved with these cases and what life was like for them.The objectivity of the author is very evident throughout the book. He presents information about the beliefs of Jehovah's Witnesses and the opinions of some of their opponents. As well, he provides an interesting view of Americans' reaction to the unknown, based upon fear and insecurity during World War II. Peters is careful not to draw the reader to conclusion about the subject or about the ultimate decision of the courts.I've already recommended this book to our community library."
3,Good for the money / perfect for the classroom,It does what is claimsUse the S-Video cable if you can. It makes a big difference. The manufacturer also makes this recommendationThe ability to enhance the picture with the controls on the unit is very limited.The item was shipped with a bad cable BUT their customer service was excellent and they sent me a new one with no questions asked.Perfect for the classroom and wallet. I teach social studies and now can run PowerPoint and streaming video
4,Works well if you avoid small fonts,"I initially used this product to put repeat the display from a Dell laptop running Win-XP Pro on a Sharp LCD TV, using the component video inputs. It was easy to set up, and rendered the image well. Running my laptop at a resolution of 1920 x 1200 pixels I found 10 pt fonts readable only with difficulty on the TV, but that is not surprising. Overall this product provides an affordable way to display sVGA on a TV.I tried to used this product to display the output RayMarine E120 on a 26"" Sony HD-TV over a long cable (25 feet). This did not work; the long cable attenuated the signal too much to be usable. Few will try such long cables, but beware that long cables can be problematic."
1,Worked great for about 5 months,"The title says it all. It worked really well, but it just died almost five months to the day from when we bought it."
1,Very Poor Design and Engineering,"Please do not buy unless you have money to throw away! I suggest the Radeon 9600 ALL-IN-WONDER AGP card, yes it costs more, but it also has a tv tuner and an FM stereo tuner, as well as 2 monitor outputs as well as many other features, and you do not have to ""fiddle around"" with cumbersome knobs and hope it work to view it on your tv.It also captures stills, and records from the FM and TV tuners so you can burn your ""favorite"" programs and movies to DVD or CD in many formats.I hope you take heed of the warning, there are also better products than this one if you can't afford the Radeon 9600.Peace!"
5,Amazing Grace by Hubert Laws,"I heard this recording on our local jazz station, and ordered it immediately. While I love the Amazing Grace piece, I'm not particularly enthusiastic about the entire CD, even though I understand that Hubert Laws is a fine musician."
5,"Didn't Want No MTV, Didn't Want No VH1.","With his 7th album, ""Snakebite"", Ridgway serves up another round of his sardonic and peculiar wit in the form of the world's brightest criminal minds and backstreet freaks. His storytelling prowess is still intact after all these years and ""Snakebite"" is one of his best recordings to date and would sit nicely alongside Ridgway classics like ""Big Heat"", ""Mosquitos"" and ""Anatomy"". I always have my favorites on each Ridgway album and here it would be ""Afghan/Forklift"", ""Running With The Carnival"", ""That Big 5-O"", ""Classic Hollywood Ending"" and his most confessional song to date, the blistering swamp rock of ""Talkin' Wall Of Voodoo Blues, Pt.1"" in which he reflects on his career with prior to Wall Of Voodoo, with the band from 77-84 and all the errors and foibles they encountered. ""Snakebite"" is 16 songs, each with a story to tell, but taken together an impressive work of seamless artistry. If you haven't listened to Stan lately it's time to get back on the bus."
2,Why the anti-feline bias?,"""Max and the Baby-Sitter"" is one of a series of children's books written by Danielle Steele, who is better known for her romance novels. The book has bright, colorful illustrations by Jacqueline Rogers.Max is a little boy who lives in New York City with his dad, who is a fireman, and his mom, who is a nurse. When he expresses his discomfort with his baby-sitter, his parents find him a new one.This could have been a pretty good children's book, but I was put off by one aspect of it. Max has a seemingly irrational fear of his first baby-sitter's cat. His new baby-sitter has a puppy and pets of four other species, but no cats. The parents never deal with Max's fear of the cat, and by the end of the book it seems like this bias against cats is reinforced. Approach with caution, especially if you are a cat lover."
1,Rated R!,"We got this for my son's 6th birthday. He opened it, we put it on only to find out that it is rated R!!! Needless to say, I told him it was broke and we turned it off. What a disappointment on his birthday. I gave the movie 1 star because he can't watch it. It is listed as ""not rated"" on Amazon. He loves to repeat lines and if there is that much bad language in it to give it an R rating, he won't be watching it for years!"
2,hipocracy,"The title implies 'gentlemen' but one of the owners of the PBA featured in this film , an ex-micro-soft executive has a definate problem with garbage-mouth unbecoming a 'gentleman' rendering ( a very appropriate word) the film unwatchable for me. I was into bowling in the Seattle area back in the Gary Mage, Terry Rey, Earl Anthony era. I don't think any of those folks would have cussed like that on camera. Maybe in the locker room. It wasn't necessary to use that language for 'shock effect'. Leave that to Holly-weird. I am contracting this purchase to the trash bin where it belongs."
4,For those of us non-bowlers,"This is an excellant movie. It doesn't go through the steps of bowling rather than what a pro bowler goes through. Much props to them and those that are keeping it alive. I don't watch much of the alternative sports on tv but will keep an eye out for the tour from now on. This movie is worth the purchase and don't keep it to yourself, share with your friends. They might laugh at first but thank you later."
4,Bowling as its own worst enemy,"I have such fond memories of Saturday afternoons in the 60s and 70s. The dulcet tonesof Chris Schenkel, the somewhat more excited style of Nelson Burton Jr., the seriousprofessionals like Earl Anthony and Mark Roth who treated the game as a sport to be respected.As has happened with society in general, bowling got loud, brash and vulgar - perhaps itsbest personification is Pete Weber. Always fearful of the ever-collapsing attention span inthis country they bowed to cornball spectacle and put the sport into the hands of the awfulJeff Miller. Instead of attempting to rise above the common objections to the character of thegame, they wallow in coarseness and showmanship.Walter Ray Williams is the class of the sport and his misgivings about the circus atmosphere are very apparent.This is a fascinating story about bowling and the kind of country we have become"
5,Poignant Look At Pro Bowlers,"This is a very interesting feature for those interested in bowling, and in particular the lives of PBA stars. Some of the trials and indignities that the best in the world go through in the name of their chosen occupation are surprising. Several prominent PBA members are featured, (Pete Weber, Walter Ray Williams Jr, Chris Barnes, and Wayne Webb. Webb, in particular, comes across as a near tragic figure) and you get some insight into the difficulties faced in touring, and in dealing with the new owners of the PBA. I was stunned at the talk given to the players by the profane and rather arrogant ex-Nike exec. Overall, a well done, insightful and poignant piece. Highly recommended for those who enjoy bowling and the PBA tour."
5,A Great Movie.,"A great movie for the every now and then bowler, and even you average league bowler. This movie puts a perspective view from behind the scenes of the PBA. A must for any bowler!"
4,This book has good qualities,This book is good with action and thrilling details. If you liked the movie you'll like this book. I couldn't put it down. I recommend it to both boys and girls ages 10-13.
4,"Every Witness Tells A Story, Story","I was struck by how effectively this funny, delicious film teaches that things are not always what they seem at first glance, and how everyone has a perspective and filter on what they observe - wow! I didn't expect that in a family-friendly 'fractured fairytale' kind of movie. I think the vast majority of viewers will be delighted by this picture and find it well worth their time, if they give it a chance.It is a small-budget production, compared to Dreamworks and Pixar animation, with something of a ""stop-motion"" feel to it (which I find charming, but your mileage may vary). The cast is excellent (Anne Hathaway, Glenn Close, Jim Belushi - and who knew Patrick Warburton is that funny?!) but the character development feels a little uneven; perhaps some of them just work better for me than others."
4,"Right up there with ""The Incredibles"" and ""Ice Age 2""","This movie does have a couple of slow sections, or I would have given it 5 stars, and much of the humor in it is so random it makes you do sort of a double take. You have to watch it a couple of times to make sure of what you thought you saw. But overall, it's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen! And the music is fantastic. Children of all ages will love the face-paced action, and older kids will understand a lot of the higher humor in it. It's a must see and a must own!"
5,Fun for all,"This is a movie for all ages. For those who want to be a kid again it is great. See the tale of Little Red Riding Hood with a twist, not only from her view, but from all involved."
5,Witty! Clever! We watch it all the time.,"I love this movie. My son has a bunch of kids movies, and when he wants to watch one together this is always the one I want to put in.It's got grown up humor, but not ""adult"" humor, so you don't have to worry about your kid repeating something awful. I hear a new one-liner or witty remark every time I watch it. Without exception I laugh out loud when we watch it. It's got quick, humorous dialoge, and good music (catch myself singing little snippits of tunes around the house). All this and my kid (5 when we got it, 6 now) thinks it's hilarious, too.Most of the characters are really likable and well done. There is one character I wish they'd have cast with a different voice, and Little Red Riding Hood could have been designed a little cuter or softer, but the movie's good features make up for the little shortcomings.Really funny. Can't decide which character I like best -- probably the wolf, but the goat's pretty darn funny, too."
4,fun fun fun,"in this movie,it starts off with a cooler,more with it[the times that is] little red riding hood.the wolf is still a cross dressing psycopath.this begs the question""do you think ed gaines was tramautized by this as a child?""anyway,a whole host of fairy tail creatures are here in a ""shrek"" meets ""csi"" type movie where the events surrounding ""the little red riding hood"" story are examined by a private eye type followed by a insanely entertaining little guy.i forget of ges a chipmunk or a squirrell or what but he goes really fast in all mannerisms,speech and actions.my favorite part is when they give him coffee.in my opinion he sort of steals the show.and id also place him right up there near stitch as one of my all time favotite characters on a kid show ever.this movue is fun for all.watch it."
3,It was ok,I enjoyed this somewhat. Some of the gags were funny like a Warner Bros cartoon. But the storyline got old [...].
5,Good Goodies,"Ask yourselves, are you tired of the same fables that were out before your time? If so, then I can guarantee HOODWINKED will not disappoint. It's the timeless Little Red Riding Hood story with more than ones imagination could've wished for. HOODWINKED is a high-energy, entertaining cartoon that the entire family will enjoy. Join in as Granny's Cottage is turned into the headquarters where the police have decided that Little Red Riding Hood, The Wolf, Woodsman and Granny are co-conspirators in the case of the Goodie Bandit. Can hearing four different tales lead to the real Goodie Bandit?Oh my goodness HOODWINKED is off the chain hilarious! When Hubby said that he had a movie for all of us, I was thinking that I wouldn't enjoy it. SO far we've watched it two times in one day.HOODWINKED is unlawfully delicious."
1,HoodSTINKED,"This is the worst movie I've ever seen. My kids were entertained (ages 3 1/2 and 7 1/2) but my husband and I thought it was awful. It is disjointed and painfully unhumorous. The jokes are really lame and predictable and the music is just randomly slapped together. It tries way too hard to be hip and reference pop culture but it fails miserably. The characters are incredibly annoying (esp. the hillbilly singing goat, the hyperactive squirrel, etc). One song that plays when Red Riding Hood thinks she's figured something out that makes her sad is called 'Red is Blue' and it is SO bad it is like a skit about a bad movie. AVOID THIS MOVIE"
1,Worst animated movie ever,If I could I would give this movie less than zero stars. It is rotten to the core. It should have been pitched in the toliet and flushed down the drain. Heaven help anyone who watches this TRASH!!!!
5,Laugh Out Loud,"This is literally a movie for those of all ages. ""Hoodwinked"" tells the story of Little Red Riding Hood like you're never heard it before. Spoofing ""Fletch,"" ""XXX,"" and more, the laughs don't stop coming and this movie has something for everyone.I'll admit that I intially thought this movie was going to be terrible. Boy was I wrong. Anne Hathaway, Glenn Close, Patrick Warburton, Andy Dick, and Xzibit are just some of the celebrities who lend their voices to this animated comedy. Buy ""Hoodwinked"" today and be prepared to be entertain."
2,was really boring for older kids and adults,"It was a really boring movie. Took everything we had to let our youngest kids finish watching it. I went in the kitchen and made my self busy and left the hubby to bear it hehe. My 10 yr old liked it ""ok"" and my 6 year old liked it but my 12 yr old and hubby and I couldnt stand it we were sooooo happy when it was done!!!"
5,this was a great movie,"My daughter, myself and my wife liked this move quite a lot. It was very funny; a good family movie."
5,A great movie!!!,This is a different spin on the tale of Little red riding hood. In this version the wolf doesn't intend to eat anybody. He is in fact a reporter who is only looking for a story. The villain in this story is a rabbit instead of the wolf. This film is both entertaining and funny. Buy it now!
3,"Mildly entertaining, but cheesy and predictable","The trailer let us to believe that this would be a Shrek-meets-Nemo animated feature. However, this film was not as nearly as Finding Nemo and I don't think that my wife and I will be watching this DVD again any time soon. Disappointing."
3,Hoodwinked makes the grade,"Hoodwinked deserves to be mentioned in the same conversation with great computer animated movies. While the movie was not highly regarded by the critics, in my opinion this movie really succeeded at what it set out to do, entertain children and the parents that brought them in a unique way.The two things about the movie that made it memorable are 1, the story, 2, the soundtrack.The story is a simple time honored one, Little Red Ridinghood, but that's where the familiar part ends. The movie tells the story from everyone's point of view, Reds, Granny's, the Wolf, etc.. As I watched the movie it was cool to see how it one story crossed over to another, kids will like, but the adults watching will appreciate it.The soundtrack is excellent! from the singing Goat to the yoddling woodcutter, it is all great! The animation was good, but not great as far as CG animation is concerned, but the story is so good everyone will enjoy it."
5,Very Funny,"When my dad took me to see Hoodwinked, I thought I would die with laughter, it was so funny. I mean who has a grandmother who does extreme sports, and bakes. who knows a squrrial who drinks coffee and gets extremely hiper, who knows of a cute little bunny who turns out to be an evil genuis. its so unreal its funny. everybody in the theatre was laughing. Red is so cool, she knows karate, has an awesome grandmother. gets to deliver things. who wouldn't want to be like that. some of the things were a little over my brothers head (he's four), like some of the animals are dressed like the village people, and one of the evil minions of the rabbit is like arnold. but over all, it was a really good, and clean movie."
5,Great Movie,My family loves this video! I love the play on the original story. Some of the content may be above younger children's heads.
3,Kids liked it,"My kids liked it, although we saw Hoodwinked 2 first and they liked that one more. Still, it's worth watching."
3,Hoodwinked Too is Better,"We watched the second movie in this series first and enjoyed it, so we bought the original later. It is entertaining, but not as good as the follow up movie."
4,A fun movie with a clever twist.,"This is a very clever take in the tired old Red Riding Hood saga from the brothers Grimm. The story features a new bad guy (not the wolf, who seems to be as much of a victim as the rest) and a pumped up grandma (Granny Puckett) who goes for extreme sports (and explosives when necessary). Got your attention? Good, see the film. `Nuff said."
2,"Ok for little kids, but that is about it.","Movie is cheap, not anywhere near the quality of say Toy Story, or something like that. Best part of the movie is the squirrel, the rest is just, well, dumb. The music is way louder than the voice, and they play chunks of annoying music every 8 minutes it seems. Probably ok for kids with short attention spans, but I can't see most adults liking this much. Really don't get what the people see in this movie who gave it high reviews."
4,Different but still fun,"I liked this twist on the classic Red Ridding Hood story. It was not too ""right now"" like Shrek. I have two pre-teen boys that have enjoyed watching the movie several times."
5,A Must Have! Great Improvement Over the DVD,"The video quality is greatly improved. I would recommend getting this combo even-though it comes with the DVD. To see the picture quality yourself go to [...]. I normally don't go by the rating system there because I have seen some blu-rays that looks awesome but had a bad video rating for some reason, so I just go by the pictures."
2,Decent First Attempt,"The theater was packed with adults and children waiting for a Shrek-like fairy tale adventure. Early in the show it becomes obvious that this is a first attempt by a new company. The animation is only so-so. For instance, when the wolf is in the river, there is overlapping animation between his legs and the water. Their animation software (or their skills) needs improvement. The story had promise, but was supplemented by musical numbers that were a little strange and too long. They really had to stretch to get the movie to feature length. The characters were OK but all seemed to have an attitude problem. No one was happy with their fairy-tale life. The best character, and the only one that got adult laughs in our theater, was the squirrel, who was kind of a cross between Chip & Dale and Scrat (Ice Age). The kids all laughed in a few places, but the adults didn't seem to find it more than mildly amusing in spots. This is not a movie I'd pay to see twice. Wait and rent it."
4,Terrific Movie,Hoodwinked is very well done and clever. The animation is very good and the writing and voice acting is top notch. Don't miss it. Even if you're an adult.
3,Ok movie,"I don't have a problem with the movie, but my son would rather watch ""How to Train Your Dragon"" or ""Cars."" Maybe he'll like it it more in a year or two once he understands what's going on better.... Movie plays great though and keeps Dad entertained."
3,"Not bad, not great","I didn't know what to expect from this, and assumed it was another kids movie along the line of Shrek, aimed at kids, with humor for adults. There are definitely some funny moments, and there is some singing, which I thought ""felt"" wrong, like it was just stuck in as an afterthought, though it seems some of the songs had longer versions that were cut.The most amusing part is the sly Fletch spoof, which fans will pick up on right away, and most other people won't even notice. I don't think kids will get most of the humor.This is worth seeing once, renting or waiting until it's on a movie channel, but I wouldn't buy it."
3,Good family film,I thought this updated version of Little Red Riding Hood was amusing. Just the right length that I didn't get bored. It's a pleasant diversion for a Saturday afternoon
3,Cute,"The movie is mostly a takeoff of ""Little Red Riding Hood"", but with a few other fairy tale characters thrown in. It's not terribly funny by adult standards (although it does have a few LOL moments) but kids seem to think it hilarious. Recommended for the under 14 crowd, but adults won't find it too bad to watch either."
2,Not that great at all.,"I did not like this movie. The animation was pretty bad, it looked like something from a video game. I remember a few times when the characters never moved except for their mouths. And a lot of the characters looked like plastic action figures. The trees looked like paper. There were a few funny parts, most of them came from the hyper squirrel...And the songs were really odd. But it was still kind of funny."
1,I'm Disappointed.,"The idea of this movie had me making popcorn and sitting down with the whole family, ready to laugh! The cover even compares it to Shrek - which was a hit with the whole family!Sitting down, popcorn bowls in hand, and within 10 minutes we were ALL dumbfounded. This was NOTHING like Shrek, other than it is a twisted fairytale. My 8 and 6 year old daughters both went to play with friends. My husband and I struggled thru it, waiting for the funny part to start. It never did.I was distracted by anything and everything thru the whole movie - I even did 2 loads of laundry!Disappointed - all of us. Not worth your money. Rent it first - if it tickles your funny bone, you're WAY under weight!-1smileycat"
3,Decepcionada,"Es una película divertida, sin embargo no puede competir con historias tan buenas como Cars(Disney/Pixar) y Vecinos Invasores (Over the Hedge/Dreamworks). Aunque presenta un punto de vista distinto de la historia de Caperucita, es bastante predecible el final."
5,Simple and Sweet,"After a trip to see the cherry blossoms in DC as a reunion with my best friends, I had some lovely photos that I wanted to share. I could have simply emailed them, but some of the pictures were so special to me that I think they deserved to be displayed. I found this pretty frame on Amazon with the engraving of ""Friends"" on it that I thought would be perfect. It's nicely priced too. A nice purchase indeed."
5,*God I Miss This Book*,"man, what can i say, this book was apart of me years ago, about 10-15 years ago, i lost mine i guess and i have been wondering for years how to get another one, i want to read it again and recapture that youth, and have it to share with children, if i ever have any, when i had this book, i read it so many times, it is truly a classic, and i cannot wait to find it again so i can remember what i so cherished about that story of the Magic In The Park.....and of the children who were allowed to explore."
2,Yikes!,"I was SO disappointed with this CD. I wanted to hear the great songs from Molly Brown - not the orchestrations! If you like listening to soundtrack album - soundtrack being the key word here - then you'll probably be okay with this version. If you want to hear LYRICS, don't get this one. I guess the lesson here is if you want lyrics, stick with the 'Original Broadway Cast' albums."
5,humor and healing,I found this to be a excellent cd I am a nurse and have followed Bernie siegels books and cd's since the late 1989 I found his book on my patients night stands His works give people hope and humor is very healing you will laugh and when you laugh it is impossible to experience any other emotion I highly recomend this cd (the mind body connection is a powerful tool that any one can use and is a recognized branch of medicine)
1,Silly junk,Silly badly written new age junk. Siegel seems to think that cancer reduces your intellectual level to that of a six year old and writes accordingly.
4,Stunningly funny. Hysterically satirical.,"This book can be read at least at two levels; both of which enjoyable. The first, as an exercise of soft porn, is executed with sophistication of prose, and therefore can be enjoyed with a sense of respectability that infrequently accompanis such endeasors. The second, as a portrait of manners (sordid and desperate as they are), is executed with deliciously sardonic winks. Good read; and plenty of justification in enjoying this articulation of dirty fun."
1,No Headache-No way!,"These headbands, labeled ""no headache"" have to be the most uncomfortable headbands I've ever worn! Between the tight sides, and the tiger teeth around the curve, your head will be pounding within a half hour. Wouldn't recommend even for my worst enemy!! Maybe if one has real thick hair the ""tiger teeth"" wouldn't be so ""biting"" but I can't see how anyone wouldn't get a headache for the tight sides, as I have a small head so if anything, this would be looser on me than the average female."
2,Awkward.,The concept it great--but overall I felt they were just to awkward to wear. They felt like they were slipping off my head.
5,They work.,"I was just looking for something very simple, and these do the job. It was a good filler for my order."
2,Ok,I am no longer happy with non adjustable plastic head bands. My head isn't built for them. These look nice and hold great but they poke my head at the ends.
4,"stays put, no headache","I'm not a fan of headbands as a general rule but I do like these. They grip the hair, stay put and don't give a headache like so many other headbands do."
1,Cheaply Made,One of the headbands already broke. If you have thick curly hair then I would highly advise you do not buy this product.
4,Better than book 1!!,"This book is better than the first, with more intimate, heart-felt times between Richard and Rose. Great climax as Rose gets kidnapped and Richard comes to her rescue! I am not a real romance reader, but these books are great. I'm bummed they don't have book 3 (which is about the wedding) on Kindle... will I have to go buy an actual hard copy?? Guess I'll wait to see if it comes out soon, because I can't stand the suspense!"
5,A poet of melodic color !,"The sense of color tonal, astonishing sense of imagination, and distinctive creative ethos of Tchaikovski's ballets have never found a best musical Ambassador than Stokowski, in Aurora we feel and aware that nobody but him could mirror with such conviction power and insurmountable expressive refinement those little insights without losing the whole meaning of the score.Many generations of conductors, notable ensembles have performed this core since then but nobody has been capable to decipher with such splendid figurative lexicon this primitive vitality and penetrating fantasy."
5,These shoes run large,I ordered these in my regular size (7 1/2) and had to return them to go down a half size. They are adorable and comfortable--just be aware that they run a little large.
2,Bad color and fit,"This was my first online shoe purchase and I thought it would be a great buy since it had such good reviews. At $25, the navy blue seemed like a good deal and looked like it would match well with a lot of my wardrobe. I was very disappointed, though, when the shoe turned out to be a much lighter blue than the picture - a bit darker than regular blue but much too bright to be considered navy blue. Also, the fit was very awkward, especially in the front toe area. It showed too much toe (not just toe cleavage - more like you can see two toe nails, which isn't attractive) and the outside of my foot below the pinky jutted out. The fit is also on the tighter side - I'm usually a 7 or 7 1/2, so I got the 7 and it was very tight! Two stars instead of one because the leather was quite nice, but I'm definitely sending them back. My advice: lean toward a larger size and avoid this shoe altogether if your foot is not very narrow."
4,Great Shoe.,"This is a well made shoe that is attractive, yet comfortable. Great purchase... I would buy them all over again."
4,at least it's in their language,hopefully this can prompt a high school graduate to think for themself and not assume college is like high school where it's fairly mapped out for you. you dont have to accept everything at face value and it does require some effort and thinking on your part. and it's all based on snippets from other kids in college written in easy form. it doesnt have all the answers but gives you an idea that there ARE questions to be asked!
4,Just as helpful as the first volume!,"This book is a perfect little graduation gift for almost everyone on your list. I've been buying several copies of vol. I every June for the past few years, so I'm delighted to see ""more tips."" It's short & snappy, contemporary, but I also found myself saying, ""Oh, yes, I'd forgotten about that! Some things about college never change!"" (Even tho' it's been a generation plus since my graduation.)"
3,Helpful,"It has good advice in it. It is a compilation of helpful quotes from students. This gives it credibility and authenticity.However, it was quite repetitive. I think it would have been more helpful if it had merely summarized the points of the chapter and then followed up with a quote for each point.I will pass it on to my sister."
5,Nick B. Herberger,"I think this book gives it's readers some great nuggets of truth about truly living your college experience to the fullest. It is practical rather than theoretical and very easy to read.The freshman year in college is a big deal, a HUGE deal ... it is a transition that few parents and students are prepared for. After working on campus in Student Life for many years I have seen how difficult this transition is first-hand. The Department of Education has shown that more that 1/3 of all new freshman will drop out before making it to their sophomore year and fewer than half of all new freshman will graduate from college.""Been There, Should've Done That II"" gives us some great ""real-life"" advice on how to weather the storm known as the Freshman Year in college![..]"
3,Strange love..,"This computer work by Robert Scott Thompson has a strange structure, a tad repetetive but also suggestive, like walking through a very surreal and extraterrestrial exhibit. I don't rank it as high as much of RSTs stuff, but when was RST ever boring? Right. Never."
3,"Only average, but overlooked","I bought this CD because I heard Chino Moreno of Deftones was on it, and I was pleasantly surprised with it. Chino's featured on the song ""Things!""; which is decent, but not quite what I expected. My favorite song is the first, ""Presto-Chango"", which uses that infamous line: 'I hate to say I told you so', and builds an awesome song around it. I don't think there's any question ""Presto-Chango"" is the best, but other standout tracks are ""Crazy American Cheese Sandwiches"" and ""Something's Always..."". Hesher's ""Self-Titled Debut"" is pretty average, but if you're looking for a new type of music (i.e. Limp Bizkit's Chocostarfish [vs] The Beta Band) then you should look into this."
1,Speechless,"I pride myself on being able to make witty comments on things that are just so bad. However, this movie was beyond bad and the best thing I could come up with was nice mullet. It is as if a bunch of middle school students got together, did a whole lot of meth, and wrote something would be funny. Apparently one of the 6th graders was related to the producer. I don't know that I have seen a worse movie ever. The other 1-star reviewer was kind in comparison to my feelings. One final word of advice - unless someone has paid you to watch it, and I mean paid you a lot, don't waste your time.PS. my wife wants to own this movie. please help."
3,Graduate student review on Formative Evaluation,This text book is being used in my graduate class on Evaluation in Instructional Technology. It is very basic and a quick read. My professor has said that this book is now dated and will not be used in his class again.
3,very broad subject,"Its ALL Asian Religions and ALL transcendentalists; I was really only interested in the emerson stuff, he challenges the old carpenter assertion that Emerson wasn't influenced by Hinduism until late in life, and he also brings up some new thoughts like Intellectual Colonialism (ed said), but I don't think that idea applies to emerson. Yes, emerson divorced the culture of India from the ideas, but he did that with everything, and he did it properly."
3,"If You Are Interested in What Doesn't Work, This Is Your Book","My husband has MS and I have read several books now on the subject. This book is great at taking the reader through the process of drug trials and telling them exactly what did not work. The author packs it full of extraneous details like what people were wearing and how often they stopped to take a sip of water. There is no mention of alternate therapies that might be beneficial in the treatment of MS, just drug trials. The author repeats details frequently like he expects people to pick up the book and to begin reading it at some chapter in the middle rather than reading it from cover to cover. If you are looking for a book that offers hope I suggest you skip this one and check out Reversing Multiple Sclerosis by Celeste PePe, D.C., N.D."
5,An important book from a major researcher,"As someone living with MS, this is one of the most important books I've read. The author is on the front lines of MS research, and he gives frank and detailed explanations of exactly what is being done to find a ""cure"" (and what can be considered a ""cure""). He helps you understand the real truth behind the two-minute sound bites the national media occasionally hypes regarding MS research. This book is an excellent and important read for anyone interested in the science behind the research."
4,"clinical, but informing","Having had MS for fifteen years, I was glad to read something a little more informing than the usual ""stuff"" I was able to learn things that I was not aware of. This book can be quite clinical and boring for the newly diagnosed. Very interesting case studies on actual patients... shows the large range of difference in this disease with each person!"
5,A truly inspiring account of Dr. Weiner's battle with MS,"This book was very educational and informative, but at the same time, very personal. I was inspired by all that Dr. Weiner has witnessed and accomplished throughout his career. I recommend this book to any treating physician, patient, family member or friend of someone affected by MS."
2,Disappointing,Gleaned some helpful information regarding medical treatment of MS but not a particularly positive or comprehensive resource with a rather egocentric presentation.
1,Save your money,"Why biographers choose to write about people they so evidently dislike is a mystery. The book always comes out flawed, full of bile and crabby. This one is no exception. The 31 Days of the title constrains the author too much, so he leaps about in time whenever it suits him. Particularly mean-spirited is his extensive quotation from President Ford's deposition, given in the late 1930's, in his mother's child support case. Unenlightening and unpleasant to read. Avoid."
4,High Drama,"The theatrical setting and back stage drama are the things which drew me to this series. This, the second book in the Lindy Haggerty Mystery series, certainly does not disappoint. Ms Freydont's characters are three dimensional and colorfully drawn. Here she combines, classical dancers, opera singers, cabaret performers and a rock star to achieve a fascinating group of victims and suspects. The plot has many twists and turns. The cruise ship is surrounded by a school of red herring. She mixes information about the art form skillfully with murder and soap opera. I highly recommend this book to mystery and theater lovers alike."
3,Robert Englund 4 Ever,"You have to love Robert Englund (Freddy Krueger and Urban Legends). This is a rather unusual role for him. I would give away the ending of this movie, but there's no need. You can tell how it's going to end in the first ten minutes. So this is not the best movie of the genre. It's probably the exact opposite. But I gave it three stars. Why? Though I'm still trying to figure this out, I liked the death scenes. There were some moments of sheer terror.If you are a slasher movie virgin, you might think this is a creative movie. However, if you love slasher movies and have seen ""all of them,"" you might want this movie. The R-rating is for sexual content, nudity, gore violence and I don't remember about the language. For the price Amazon has, it's worth the risk."
2,Nothing you haven't seen before,"Completely pedestrian 'psycho on the loose' film that is further marred by an actor playing a double role... but the actor in question has such a unique facial structure that he is recognizable even trhough the heavy make-up. As such, one of the film's 'revelations' is instead an irritant. Worse, the lead actress isn't really much of an actress.'Dance Macabre' stars Robert Englund and a bunch of young dancers. A St. Petersburg ballet academy has just opened its doors to dancers from the West and girls have flocked to it in the hopes of studying under a legendary Russian dancer. But then the girls start to vanish, and then they start to turn up dead. Who's the killer?Actually, unless you're 11 years old and this is the first movie of this type you've ever seen, the 'who' is obvious from the outset. As is the 'why.' And with those out of the way, there's not really any other reason to watch this film..."
2,Selling 2008 Appointment Book for 2009,"I love Filofax - have always found their products to be luxurious, and practical.On the product description it says 2008 calendar pages, when now is the time to get 2009 organizers.Now, I'm afraid to make a purchase fearing I might receive an appointment book for last year.Be really careful - make sure the product description is exactly what you are looking for!"
5,Very well written,"I thoroughlly enjoyed this book. I am an avid reader and this was my first local author. I was pleasantly surprised at the professionalism and am anticipating another book. I enjoyed the connection of the characters and the historical background as well. It shows that anything is possible if you put your heart and mind into it, no matter how hard you may struggle to get there."
2,Mingus absent,"I have to agree with a music fan in New York that this album is missing the essential jazz element. It is jazz musicians playing a Mingus score. There is little improvisation or ""fire in the belly."" If you must have everything by Mingus don't let me stop you. But if you are checking him out for the first time there are many classic recordings that are more worthwhile."
1,Nothing but Noise,I am really disappointed that I spent a nickel on this piece of jumbled noise called a CD. Too bad I can't send it back.
4,Great for Portability,"I bought this canoe recently and have tried it on the water. Its a fantastic canoe for people without an ability to transport a regular canoe.Plusses:1. Fantastic portability.2. Inflates quickly and easily. Really does take 10 mins or less.3. Light - easy to get into/out of the water4. Sturdy - felt very comfortable and secureMinuses:1. Is VERY difficult to get back into the bag. Suggestion: buy a bigger bag.2. Requires Kayak Paddles - canoe paddles too long. (Not a minus, really - just good to know. Its shaped like a canoe but sits more like a kayak.)Overall - well worth the price and a great alternative to a traditional canoe."
4,Gets the job done,"I purchased this canoe for a less typical use. Since my three children are too small to paddle a canoe and I'm the only experienced paddler in the family, we decided that on our BWCA trip we would need to tow a couple of the Duluth packs in order to fit the whole family in our 18' Mad River. We tethered the Stearns Inflatable behind us with the food pack and camp pack in it. We crossed Brule with this setup on a fairly windy day without any trouble. The Stearns stayed inflated through the whole trip without any air loss. I even took it on a paddle in the north bay for some fishing, handled nicely once I got used to it."
4,wow factor,Just returned from three days at New Port harbor paddling around the bay this boat was fantastic. inflates in seconds with anelectric pump and is sturdy and and very maneuverable. I must have been stopped 25 time by people wanting to know about the boat (the Kayak crowd).using kayak paddles are a must the longer the better. I watched all day the people in their Sevylor's and and cheep inflatables getting blown around or just squirming side to side when being paddled. This Canoe really stays on track.The only draw back is that it gets wet and really needs to be dried out well before packing it away.
5,"NFL Country... ""Whatever It Takes""","I was amazed by the song ""Whatever It Takes"" co-written by Kenny Chesney and Peyton Manning. I didn't expect such an endearing song co-written by Peyton Manning, QB with The Indianapolis Colts!!! He actually has a pretty good voice, although I have read other comments to the contrary. It is just such a song that would be attractive to a lady that he really cared for. Perhaps he has a second career in his future."
2,a very odd book,"I only read the first of the two long stories in the book, but it was a chore. There are no, read that as zero, sympathetic characters. The plot is straightforward adventure, and interesting as far as it goes, but the humor promised is not forthcoming. The view of the Filipino film industry has potential but is not developed."
5,Brilliant,"Bought this collection for a music freak and it was a hit. Mississippi John Hurt is the king and should be in everybody's collection and since this is all studio recordings, this is the collection to have."
3,__,"Although this set serves as a welcome introduction to Hurt's genius, the original recordings suffer a bit from vinyl-to-CD remastering. It seems as if a very bright sun shines through ""Staggolee,"" which isn't actually a fitting visual for the devilish tune. For a true indication of Hurt's capabilities, check out his furious early reading of ""Frankie"" on Harry Smith's ""Anthology of American Folk Music."""
5,Smooth as Silk...but Twice as Durable,"It's hard to imagine acoustic finger-picking blues being any smoother, yet heartfelt, than this. This fabulously mastered collection assembles the three studio albums MJH recorded in the 70's following his ""rediscovery"". The music, sound, and feeling is all there - and it's an absolute PLEASURE to listen to - pop and scratch free - as it was recorded with relatively modern equipment in the 70's.MJH's intricate and beautifully styled finger-picking represents a degree of confidant mastery that perhaps could only be created by 40 years of playing in relative obscurity working to please only yourself...and his engaging vocals compliment seamlessly.These three disks are like a favorite sweater on a cool night, comfortably warm, and the fit is just right."
5,Classic Blues,"This compilation of Mississippi John Hurt's Vanguard recordings are classics. These albums were recorded in the 60's after he was re-discovered by a music industry full swing into folk, blues, and ""old timey"" music. The audio quality is superb, the songs are timeless, and the voice is amazing. A must have for any serious blues fan. Robert Johnson is not the end all, be all of delta blues. Check out Mississippi John Hurt."
1,Joe [That's not ]Cool Blowe1,I want to say something good about this joint but I honestly can't.I was looking for the Joeski with Pee Wee's Dance and got this one by mistake i think I paid .99 cent for it I only listened to it once and I only like one track on the whole Cd. and the production on 1 of the others The joint was brand new unopened and I see why.Maybe i'll try to listen to it again one day to see if I misjudged it but I don't think so.1 song .99cent evens out I guess Blowe!
4,ANOTHER GREAT WORLD CLASS GUITARIST I'D NEVER HEARD OF!,"I bought it because I wanted an audio CD of Campo from Carlevaro's Preludios Americanos. (I intend to play it at the Cactus Café on the UT campus in March....) I wanted some ideas other than what's on youtube. Richard plays everything beautifully (of course). I would have liked to have the Campo played w/ more ""space"" but his interpretation gave me much to consider. The first cut, Variations ..... by Giuliani has truly inspired me. Good technical workout! I followed along w/ the printed music in Scott Tennant's Pumping Nylon. Great mix of gentle phrasing & aggressive attack. Wow! This CD was recorded in '93. Would love to hear him today. Hey Richard! Y'all come on down to Austin, TX & book a gig!"
3,A real double edged blade,"Well what can I say what you have here is two films one of high standard and another a lousy production.Rumble in the bronx: Great fun this one got the 3 stars, highly recomended.Rumble in Hong-Kong: Dissapointing just watch the first one and be happy."
2,Only if you are a completeist,"While Rumble in the Bronx is easily a five star movie, including R.I.Hong Kong brings the total score down. Jackie Chan's screen time is minimal and the production values are low even by HK film standards. If you must own every Chan film, or you want to see a young chan play the villian (actually unique to this film) get it. If not try Young Master or Snake in Eagle's Shadow."
4,FYI-- Chronicles of Faydwer Includes Both Previous X-Packs,"I would like to inform anyone who is looking to buy this product, just to purchase the Chronicles of Faydwer instead of their special offer (Chronicles of Fay + Kingdom of Sky) as this product includes the previous two x-packs already (Kingdom of Sky and Desert of Flames). The interesting part is that amazon.com did not include a screenshot of the back of the box, which states that this product includes the full EQ2 game plus the previous two x-packs. And, I have emailed amazon.com on this and sent a review of the product to them, including a link to SOE's shop website that includes the same description as the back of the Fey x-pack's box. Yet, they have not removed their special offer yet."
3,Walker,"This is a little known film directed by Alex Cox and well worth watching. I was Production Manager for the Tucson location. This film is filled with Anachronism's,i. e., all sorts of modern items creep into a film that supposedly took place in the 1800's. It is a sleeper and fun to watch."
3,shoot the prisoners,"americans sponsor some guys who go into a central american country to bring 'universal sufferage' and to provide 'stability'. sound familiar? walker is a tale of megolmania and ahistorical vertigo with surrealist parallels to the modern era. it's an amusing black comedy, about equal parts sergio leone and luis bunuel. the dim and sarcastic view of american imperial behavior and myth making did not endear this film to most critics, especially the anti-intellectual, anti-art, pro 'entertainment' hacks (like a ceratain oft-quoted movie/video critic who shall remain nameless (wink, wink)). but for the rest of us, especially those with a skeptical view of offical history, walker is both funny and frightening, with great characterizations by ed harris, peter boyle, rene auberjunois, miguel sandoval and yes, marlee matlin."
1,Total Dissapointment,I expected to get the videos of the real Sonora Band playing the songs......very cheap videos .....the music is good though.....
3,"Not necessarily junk, but hardly ""superior"" considering who the chief songwriter is","This quintet of five young men are certainly respectable, and there is nothing eminently dislikeable about this album. However, it does have a very formulaic standardness about it, which is somewhat upsetting considering that all but one of the songs was written by Maurice Starr, whose name is practically synonymous with some of the best teeny-bopper music ever."
4,why isn't this on dvd yet ???????,"I am waiting for this to come out on dvd !and now that Dom Deluise is deceased ....(but on it's own credits .....)but it is a great movie,with some really hilarious scenes !!!!and then you have Jimmy Walker too,a well known comic actor .there were scenes in the restaurnt with the chimp that are just way too funny ....they just have to make this available on dvd !!!"
5,NOTHING COMPARES,NEVER HAS THERE BEEN A GREATER COMPILATION THAN THIS. THIS ALBUM WILL RIP YOU IN HALF AND DEFECATE INTO YOUR TORSO.REAL TALK!Here is the comparisonA League of Our Own 2--------|***********Bad Boys Soundtrack----------|******Soundbombing 2---------------|********Dexter's Lab: Home Boy Genius-|**********Yanni Live---------------------|wtfKey: * = cool factor
5,UGHH WHUT?!?,"This album eminates the blinding light of 1000 suns. It is so good, my IQ rises exponentially when I listen to it. And did you know if you buy this album, an internet emcee gets his wings?"
3,Bed Webb - Easy to use,Bought the Spidy small bed webb and had the chance to use it the next day. I haul a lot of light items in the open bed of my pickup for a catering business. I usually have to use rope and tarps to hold it down from blowing out. It's a snap with the bed webb. Just cover the load with the net and hook it on the exsisting cargo hooks. Easy on and easy off. Great product.
5,Great Relaxer,I have used the Affirm Mild FiberGuard relaxer for about 2 years. It is a great product. My hair comes out straight and with a lot of body. The company was fast with shipping the product to me in Hawaii.
4,Very Good Relaxer,This is one of the best relaxers I have used in a long time. I purchased it after years of using no lye relaxers on my hair. As a result my hair is very dry. I used the Affirm Fiberguard relaxer and it has worked really well on my hair. I have relaxed my hair twice with it and I only have good things to say about it. You will not be disappointed. I have thick coarse hair but the regular strength relaxed my hair just fine.My only caution is to work really fast if you are tender headed like I am. It starts to tingle much faster than the no lye relaxers.
5,Great product,Ordered this product multiple time and it works great with the conditioner and scalp care line. Would recommend it to anyone who wants straight hair and can follow the directions for timing.
2,Two Stars - at most,I am watching this on MGM HD and its two star rating on my Time Warner guide may be exaggerated. This is a dull and boring excuse for a movie. The scene with Lowe and the other guy hang gliding away from the Iraqis with their fan propelled back packs was hysterical. This is an awful movie with dreadful acting. Don't waste your time.
4,Better than any other SEAL film. Don't miss this one.,"TFH is the SEAL film you've been waiting to see. The action sequences are spankin', exciting, and full of realistic-looking tactical detail. In comparison, G.I. Jane and Charlie Sheen's Navy SEALs were high-budget, big-hype Hollywood disappointments -- all promise, weak game.Shimon Dotan is the only director to have successfully translated on film the general public's fantasy of Navy SEALs in training and in action.Admittedly, the development of the lead characters' personal lives is slow, flat and dull by comparison. But the action scenes are so darn satisfying, I don't care.I just wish they made many more films like this one."
5,Great for kids.,"This book is a definate plus for kids. It has a simple story, one side is for older kids that includes more description, and one side is the simpler story for littler kids. Kids relate to the story and are able to open up while you are reading. A definate must have for social worker dealing with domestic violence, or abuse."
2,Drawings boring... concerns with one.,"The drawings in this book are kind of boring, plain black and white. And, on one page, it depicts a man slapping a woman while the kid looks on - while I know this is a reality for some kids, I didn't feel the picture was appropriate."
4,Fun,"A rather odd film this is a lot of fun. One of the better animated movies to come out in recent years and a departure from the standard fare. If you haven't seen it, see it."
2,Not impressed at all.,"I like ""How it was done"" movies but this was vague to say the lease. I was expecting to see something different than every other behind the scenes clip. This was the worst yet. Sorry! The movie itself was ok. :)"
2,Saves you from watching the movie...,"I would give this one star, but it does stop you from wasting your time on the film.Otherwise it has no redeeming quality."
2,whats the point of this movie?,There is a scientest that created the technology for food to come out of the sky. so thats pretty much the story line. aint disney awsome now?
2,Boring,"Saw it in the theaters with my son. It was very disappointing. Seemed to be slapped together without much thought. This is definitely not in the same class as a ""Toy Story"" or ""Shrek"". My 6 year old got bored with it and wanted to leave the theater."
3,Okay,"Just a short video about the making of the movie. Not that interesting, but I appreciate the option to use freebies to test it out before purchasing a movie."
5,Great movie!,My daughter loves this movie. It is a fun and adventures movie for little ones and adults. I loved it too!
5,a celebration of nerdiness,"I loved the movie. OK, I've been obsessed with the movie because it has so much attention to detail. You can 'walk' down the streets, reading all the little signs, noticing how shadows cast, soaking in the blindingly gorgeous colors and music. Catch all the little grimaces, rolling eyes and behind the back comments that make the characters so human. I love the clever social comments, too. This movie is so much more than a cartoon. Those involved poured their hearts into making ""Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs"" a little masterpiece. Learn about their driving ambitions for this project and the fun they had doing it."
4,Entertaining,Great movie for the kids!! The family seemed to enjoy this movie:-) I would recommend it to Ithere's with little ones.
3,A useful handbook for environmental analyst,"The book is a analysis method database which contains a total of about 1700 analyte/method summaries involved in waters and soli waste analysis. The analytical methods were listed according to chemical names or CAS number in order to consult.In this point,it is more reasonable to published in electronic or web edtion. EPA's Air Compendium Methods were not included in the book. Because of continuing updated EPA methods,the book ofen need to be revised."
3,"Ok, but just ok","Looks very basic and isn't complicated to use. Door seems to seal tight which is great. Biggest complaint is the touchpad numbers are covered by plastic and over time, the plastic doesn't stay flush and taut, rather develops wrinkles and just excess folds. Wish the keypad would light up at night and the door were quieter when opening and closing."
1,Wrong size delivered versus order,I ordered the item to fit my pick up and you shipped a large size. I returned it and received a refund. Still looking for one the right size. You had none so I am looking elsewhere.
5,replacement bulbs,I was happy to receive these hard to find bulbs. They arrived quickly and were put to use right away.
1,AMAZON IS A JOKE!,"I THOUGHT SHOPPING ON AMAZON WAS SAFE AND WITH GOOD VENDORS, I WAS WRONG... YOU ARE BETTER OFF BUYING FROM EBAY! ..... AMAZING ENOUGH THE VENDOR THAT DIDN'T SEND US THE PRODUCT WE BOUGHT AND PAID FOR IT STILL SELLING ON AMAZON! WHERE DO YOU FIND YOUR VENDORS? IN DARK ALLEY WAYS?"
4,Good item but to small for my girlfriend,This item is too small if you are 38C or above.Please keep this in mind when you order. This unit does work correctly.Wish they made one a little larger.
5,It's wonderful,"As you may guess from the title, this book is comprised of variations on Mother Goose rhymes with a theme of wildlife found in Alaska. The author has a wonderful command of words and I love the images she creates. The delightful illustrations compliment the text well. The rhymes have the charm of traditional Mother Goose rhymes, but are mixed with inspiring images of nature rather than images of violence (the baby and cradle falling, etc.). I am so happy to have run across this book."
5,Superb for children from all locales,"My daughter particularly loves the Alaskan version of ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"" We live in Alaska, and she has seen the northern lights--she learned ""Twinkle Twinkle Northern Lights"" first. This is a great book"
3,This. Movie. Rocks.,"This is one of those films I saw as a kid on late night TV, and it scared the bejeezus out of me. Then I saw it by chance in college, and it was so silly and funny...but still a little creepy. Yes, bad acting, bad filmmaking, bad plot, but why do I still like it? I agree with another reviewer about the MST-3K quality to this film...plus beefcakey Tom Selleck thrown in for good measure. It touches all the 70's taboos: a bit grindhouse, a bit sexploitation, a bit of S & M, AND a kick butt ending you'll never see coming. I'd say it is solid B-movie fare."
5,Is Awful! I love it!,"This movie is poorly acted, edited and directed but I still love it! Something about the way things move-the dissappearing dog, the paintings, etc....I first found it as a kid and watching it as an adult I still liked it which is not always true of old movies.Tom Selleck probably wishes this was off his resume but he was perfect for the role.I wonder what happened to all of the painings they used in the movie?Anyone know?5 out of 5 stars."
3,COMEDY AT ITS BEST!!,"I happened upon this video years ago , and I actually forgot how funny it was. The acting was terrible the scenery awful and the plot unbelievable. If you look closely you'll see a young Tom Selleck as the husband of one of the daughters of Satan. All the awful stuff aside it really is a funny movie something that should be on Mystery Science Theater, thats how funny it is . My friend Pia is from the Phillipines and she actually had a great time watching the movie, if you want to have a great laugh get some wine, crackers and a few friends over belive me its worth. it ."
2,tom rises above the script,"This movie features a early Tom Selleck performance and he handles it very well. The lead actress also shines here , the supporting csst isn't half bad either. The problem is the vague script and low budget. This was made in the phillipines , that country at the time had it's own film industry and produced some wild movies like 'octoman' and some decent war movies too. These were all low budget affairs but they have some charm, this one has a unclear plot in that the satanists reincarnatied witches don't remember who they are. This just spoils the premise to a degree but it's at least in english and the print looks pretty good on dvd. It's horror exploitation (it has some nudity fmeale of course and scenes of half naked women getting whipped too) but that doesn't save this one in the end. However I love horror flicks and have seen alot worse. the idea of the painting possessing people was a good one too but it's the blanking out part of this that spoils it."
1,YOU GOT TO BE Kidding!!!,A 30 year old 2 star movie with no sdh or subtitles for 20 dollars!! I don't think so. Are they really selling these overpriced no subtitled dvd-r ripoffs?? It's a shame and a disgrace-If they want to sell these old titles they need to package them/subtitle them and price them fairly-they'll sell-money will be made and movieviewers will be happy. Sounds simple doesn't it?
1,HATE IT!!,"I do not like this keyboard. The idea of spill proof is nice BUT.. its not a great keyboard. I dont expect much for this price but it hurts my fingers to type on it. Have to keep pressing the buttons and it throws me off cause i type average speed and i have to go back and retype everything because my text ends up like this ""Helo hw ae yo?"" It just is a pain.. Im returning it today -_-"
1,"Great idea, but not for all PCs","I bought one at a local branch of a national electronics store. I had difficulty typing at any great speed. In addition, my dial-up internet connection was MUCH slower. Slower that is, until I started getting 'dl' errors in my browser (Internet Explorer). Evenually, I got a blue screen of death with a message indicating 'Press enter to return' or 'Ctrl-alt-delete' and lose all work. Neither worked. I had to hard-shut down my machine. I am using a Gateway 800 MHz Pentium III. Switched back to my old keyboard and problems went away. In other words, STAY AWAY.... at least for internet use. It worked OK for MS WORD.It's not going to stay around the house long enough to see if the letters wear off the keys. Please see other reviews for this product."
4,"Marvelously inventive, well written","No, McNamee is not the next Nobel prize winner, but he is so inventive that you should read his stories. Each story begins as a normal story in a normal world only to veer into a humorous unexpected world - a ""shape changer"" who becomes a new constellation, an unsuccessful poet who invents Homer. The collection contains a sufficient mix of structure and content to make each story a new treat. Recommended."
5,A great help!,"My grandparents fled from Kessab. Growing up I always LOVED the old armenian recipes. Grandma would teach the women how to make sarma and Kufta, and my dad made sarma pretty well, too. Kufta and some of the other goodies I loved as a kid left with grandma back in '73. My dad(now 92) found this old recipe book in a drawer, but it was deteriorated. I found this one here on Amazon, and made some Kufta(close to grandmas) and really remenised about the family. I am using the book to make some more goodies for my dad, so he can relive some of the old wonderful tastes of an era gone by. Thank you for offering this."
1,"Despite stellar cast, movie really sucks.","Oh my. This was bad. This was REALLY bad. How did this get any good reviews? It's so lousy.This movie simply has no point and seems to have no purpose other than to wallow in emotion. 9 distinct wallowing sessions in which women experience severe disappointment. But the ""wallowing"" is painfully melodramatic. A crappy script ruins even good actresses. There was just nowhere for them to go.I'm stunned at the amazing cast. How did they get themselves into such a jam?"
2,It was ok,"The movie wasn't what I expected, It just dragged and there wasn't a whole lot of important things, well to me anyway. It is kind of boring"
3,Nine sad and inconclusive stories. I found them all depressing.,"This 2005 film includes nine different vignettes. All of them are about turning points in women's lives. There's some star power here including Glenn Close, Dakola Fanning and Holly Hunter and the acting is excellentEach story is short, to the point, and inconclusive. They also all have an aura of sadness and loss. Yes, the technical aspects of this film are good and the concept is interesting. But, frankly, I don't like short stories. Even in my reading experiences I usually go for a long, well developed work. Some of the characters in one story do appear in a minor role in another. But this just seems like a trick for device.All the stories have emotional impact but frankly I found them depressing. Therefore, I can't recommend this to anyone but the most dedicated film buff."
2,Can't Believe I Wasted My Time!,"Ok, so huge cast. This is a movie about nine women. I expected the movie to be like ""Crash"", have multiple stories that tie into each other at the end. They don't!!Some of the stories are just so bizarre they make no sense. We never get to understand why these women were nuts, what they did or how they ended up the way they did.So...whats the point?This was just plain stupid!"
4,Haunting!,"It appears that everyone in each of these nine episodes is in a prison of sorts. For some it is overt, like a real prison or a debilitating illness, and for others it is caused by something in their past, like an abusive father or the untimely death of someone close.The question in my mind is whether the film is trying to expand from these nine stories to the stories within all of us. Are each of us in our own prison, perhaps of our own making.Some of these stories were difficult to watch . . actually most of them were. And none of them had a conclusion, except, perhaps, for the scene in the graveyard. But all of them ended on a down note, and is that too a metaphor for the difficulty in just trying to make one's own way in the world . . that it is impossible, and that there may be very little, if anything, in life worth living for or to sustain us.Not an uplifting expeierience, but a rather haunting one."
5,Lo mejor del 2006,En esta película Rodrigo muestra que es uno de los mejores directores de latinoamerica aunque se esconda en LA.
4,Great musicians. Witty lyrics. Whatever happened to them?,"I discovered these guys back in 1992 in my sister's junk pile of tapes, among other unknown artists, back when she worked for a music/video distribution company. 'Me & Elvis' is the first track, which caught my attention right off the bat. In following with the whole 'Elvis-faked-his-death' thing, this song talks of how they hung out together up to the time when Elvis supposedly fakes his death. 'Hole In My Head' is a nice song about how typically childish men can be in relationships. But my favorite song is 'These Are The Days' with it's upbeat, if rather cynical, view of life. All in all, it's worth owning because these guys are great musicians who, as you'll find out if you listen to the CD, have diverse musical influences. By the way, I found the CD version years later at a flea market and bought it right away."
5,One of the Albums I'd want if I were shipwrecked,"One of the great tragedies in music is that this band disappeared after this one eponymous album. Ross Rice (who penned most of the songs, I believe) might be one of the best composers you probably never heard of. If only they'd released ""These Are the Days"" first, maybe . . . The lyrics are great, the arrangements were like nothing else I had ever heard at the time it came out, and still sound fresh. Oddly enough ""Me and Elvis"" isn't my favorite cut. And believe it or not, I bought it because I liked the cover design.I just recently found out about ""Umpteen"" and ""Dwight,"" both of which I now have on order.This album is on my list of CDs to have if I were ever shipwrecked. The same list with ""Mountain Dance"" by Dave Gruisin, and Beethoven's Symphonies."
4,Finally!,I am so glad I finally found this album again!My brother and I had a cassette years ago and we wore it out!I can't frickin wait for it to arrive!Wish the band still put out more
4,Looking Forward to More Brownstone Stories,"Could this be ""Tales of the City"" for New York? While this first installment may not have allowed for Maupin's depth of character development, ""Brownstone"" certainly shows promise. This was a great invention to introduce a number of lives, most of them intersecting each other. The characters were believable because the author didn't resort to stale stereotypes or tired queerisms. I do hope that we'll be seeing more of the Brownstone. If only there were such a place in every neighborhood. Not a bad place to weather either the storms of reality or metaphor."
5,Perfect,"I just got a new 15 inch laptop (macbook pro). I thought about getting this stand, but decided instead to opt for the 20 inch apple cinema display. Well, the cinema display and my laptop didn't really like each other that much--the hassle of plugging into (and unplugging when I wanted to go mobile 3 connectors combined with dealing with different screen resolutions (with the cinema display losing that comparison) convinced me to return it before 5 days had passed. I turned around and purchased this mstand to bring my laptop to the proper ergonomic level, and plugged my keyboard into it. Wow. The experience is so much better than the display. If you have a laptop that you sometimes want to use in an office environment and other times want to take with you on the plane or to a meeting, this seems a great solution. Perhaps box the same height would work as well, but it wouldn't look as pretty."
5,I'm loving it!,"This is by far one of the best accesories I've bought. The mStand feels so steady that you don't even need to buy an exta keyboard, you can just place your hands on top of your computer in a very comfortable way. It also has many rubberized stuff to make sure the laptop won't fall down or get scratched.If you have a lot of cables, you can just place them under the mStand and with the circular cutout on the back they won't bother at all.Really solid material. Highly recommended! By the way, it works great not only for Macbooks."
4,"Solid build, looks great","Thing stand simply rocks. The build quality is on par with Apple's quality, it matches well, and it's *heavy*, which is a huge plus. This thing won't budge, which is exactly what you need.My only real ""complaint"" is that the angle forward is a bit extreme, but it puts my rMBP screen at a perfect height for viewing along side my Thunderbolt display. All around excellent product."
3,"Neat looking but not compatible for all 15""","It is a nice looking laptop stand but for my Asus M50sa did not provide stable position.Most likely due to its was being designed for Apple laptops. So i had to get myself Xbrand ones and very content w/ them. I gave this to my friend who's using it for his 13""+ laptops seems to be working fine for him."
4,Almost perfect,"It looks great, keeps the laptop cooler, and helps my back out (no more slouching). I just wish I could adjust it to make it a bit taller. This is something I knew before I bought it, but I went with it anyway for the overall quality and crossed my fingers. The height is almost perfect for me so it was the correct choice. Someone who is a tall person should get an adjustable model. If I was going to change I would go with the same company, but choose an adjustable model. Overall, I like this better than the other brands that are adjustable."
5,"Looks like an Apple product, perfect match for MacBook Pro","Works great with my MacBook Pro (Late 2008). It brings it up to a better height to use with an extended keyboard, mouse and external monitor. Frees up some desk space because it has a smaller footprint than the whole computer. I can open up the computer far enough to tilt the monitor back as far as I need to. As others have pointed out there is now a cutout where you can access the ""latch"" area."
4,M Stand,I like the M stand. I have a dell laptop and it works perfectly. It also gives me more space and helps my neck.
5,Perfect height and angle,"This laptop stand is perfect, both in angle and height. Its made of solid aluminum so its got a little weight to it and very sturdy. The aluminum helps dissipate heat which is also a plus. It has rubber bumpers in all the right spots so it keeps the laptop in its place. Its a little on the pricey side but its worth it.Pros:sizeheightangleCons:price"
2,"Would be a great design, had they tested it.","Although I would really like to give this stand three stars, I can't give it any more than two. The stand is beautiful, sturdy and does a good job of holding your laptop. Great. It contains a cable routing hole in the rear to keep cables neat. Smart. That said, this product suffers from a single major design flaw that just can't be overlooked: The cable routing hole is too small to accommodate the DVI plug from an apple Cinema display, despite the fact that the stand is shown *right next to* an apple cinema display in the product's retail packaging.FAIL.Fail. Fail. Fail.Did rain design not try to plug this into a single laptop accompanied by a Cinema Display before taking the design to the manufacturing step? Incredible. Sure, you can bypass the hole for the cinema display plug, but then what's the point in having the cable routing in the first place???"
1,mStand Laptop Stand,It is too big and bulky. It has no flexability and while I like the undersection where I can store the laptop it actually serves no other purpose. I don't know what I was thinking when I got it. It is too high to be of value.
2,Expensive chunk of metal.,"Pro: It is sturdy. The design allows me to store my keyboard underneath which frees up desk space. Positions laptop 8"" above my desk.Con: Height is not adjustable. $49 is a lot of money for a piece of metal bent into a ""U"" shape. The lip of the notebook stand curls around front of laptop to keep it from sliding off the notebook stand, but I use a seperate fan pad under my laptop and the notebook stand lip is not wide enough to hold the fan pad and laptop."
4,"Seems a bit pricey, but very high quality.","I wanted a laptop stand for my desk. The $50 price tag seems a bit high, but I ordered one anyway. This item is very well made and looks great in its simplicity. I still think the $50 is a big high, but I am glad I bough it anyway. Stop angsting and go for it!"
5,"Excellent design, elegant appearance","This is the second mStand that I've purchased. I had one at home and just had to get one at the office where I have a big 30"" display. It's ideal for raising up a MacBook Pro to be in alignment with larger displays, and also helps to declutter my desk. Additionally, raising the MacBook Pro off a flat surface provides more airflow, preventing my Mac from overheating.All in all, extremely satisfied with the design, construction, and appearance of this product."
5,"Best laptop stand, EVER!","I purchased this stand for my Mac Book Pro laptop and was extremely satisfied with the purchase to arrival part of the transaction. My only suggestion would be to make the cabling hole on the back of the stand a little larger so that a DVI connector could fit thru it. I would purchase again in a heartbeat as this is a very stable, good looking laptop stand!"
5,It's good,"This little stand is good in bed, good in an arm chair and good on another stand. It came missing some rubbers, but they sent me some more rubber bumpers, so it's all good. Very useful in general. Buy it and see."
5,Great notebook stand for Macbook,This is an awesome stand for a Macbook. It is heavy and solid. I bought this instead of the Griffin Elevator since the Mstand includes the front lip to prevent the laptop from sliding off the stand. The Elevator has the possibility of allowing the laptop to slide when the rubber pads get dirty.
2,Does NOT work for seventeen inch (17'') laptops,"This stand does NOT work well for 17 inch laptops. The design is great and everything about it is perfect except for the fact that it does NOT work well with 17 inch laptops. It IS possible to steady your 17'' laptop on this stand, but if you try to adjust the screen or move it around your laptop can easily fall backwards because it is hanging over the edge. I would NOT recommend this stand for a 17'' laptop."
5,Great Stand,"This is a great stand because it is extremely stable (even with a 17"" MacBook Pro), has great non-slip pads to both protect your laptop from moving and from being scratched, is very strong and solid, helps to dissipate heat, and looks great and/or matches other Apple products in appearance!I noticed that some reviewers complained about not being able to access the opening latch/lip of your laptop. You must have an older model because mine has a cut-out to allow you to easily open your laptop."
5,Great product,"I love this laptop stand, which I bought after using it for a month during a visit to another office. I had it for a few months now and have no complaints. I'd buy it again. I wish it were a bit cheaper, but it seems to be well built and durable, so I can live with the price."
5,Don't hesitate - definitely a keeper!,"I saw many of the reviews who had used this with a 15"" laptop, and wondered how well it would work with my 17"" MBP. I don't know anyone that owns one, so I was a little uncertain. No worries - it works PERFECTLY! See the image I loaded that shows it in use, along with a 22"" Gateway monitor, and a 24"" HP monitor that complete my workstation.The design leaves room underneath the unit, which is great for extra storage, or sliding a keyboard under (although it's not quite high enough if you tried to type under it). Solid construction that should last, quite simply, forever. The unit positions the laptop's screen to a height that works perfectly with my other external monitors.Interestingly enough, the packaging it came in even reminded me of how Apple would have packaged it. It's a wonderful product that fills an obvious need, and is one of those ""why didn't I think of that"" items. Simple design, beautiful, and very functional."
3,so close...and so sexy,"It truly looks like it was made for my macbook pro, beautiful design. I like the angle just fine and it is so much better than a flat stand.They just fell short in a few, important, areas.- The hole in the back, the one used for cord maintenance, isn't wide enough for my DVI monitor cable.- While there is now a cutout for the lid release, and it works...it should be wider and lower so I don't have to wiggle my finger in there to open it.So it looks hot...but functionality wise they just missed a few key points. Rain, if you're listening...use your products before you put them to market."
2,Malfunctioning Pads?!,"I purchased this ""mStand Laptop Stand"" by Rain Design for my 17"" MacBook Pro on September 19th, 2010 and it quickly arrived on September 22nd. It was perfect...the design is sharp, it color matches my MBP perfectly. Here we are 11 days later on Sunday, October 3rd, and the pads that keep the laptop in place have decided they need a break. In other words, the pads aren't doing their job. This morning when I had turned away from my computer, it fell off the stand onto the floor, which of course negates the entire purpose of this stand. This stand is supposed to tilt the backside up so you're able to use your laptop as a monitor. After purchasing a wireless keyboard and wireless mouse through Amazon.com, I was good to go! I've e-mailed Rain Design support hoping this might be a one time fluke only with this stand, because the other reviews for this product have been outstanding."
5,Love it,Perfect height and tilt. I like that my keyboard and hand fit under if comfortably so that I can have my computer a little closer to myself.
5,GREATTT,"Excellent!... this stand is sleek, sturdy, and a great look for my office.. I would definitely recommend this to anyone."
5,Exactly as advertised.,"Beautifully constructed ... looks like it could be an Apple product. It only has one function, a stand for your laptop and it performs that function with my MBP perfectly."
5,"Works Great, Looks Great","I have a Dell laptop and was a little skeptical since this seems to be geared toward Mac users. But I couldn't be happier, my 14"" laptop fits perfect and is exactly what I was looking for."
4,works like a charm,"No issues and it looks and works great, just wish it has some kind of USB hub or dock. Cleaned up my cluttered desk nicely."
5,"Great stand, minor issues","GOOD: The mStand raises my 15"" MacBook Pro to the same eye level as my 22"" LCD external monitor, has good aesthetics with or without the laptop present, acts as a heat sink, and gives me space underneath for laptop accessories such as USB hub, charger, card reader, etc. It is perfect for a solitary laptop with no external monitor. Cheaper via Amazon than Rain's own webpage or anywhere else.BAD: The cut-out for the laptop lid release needs to be a little deeper and wider (but its still entirely functional), although the stand can be set adjacent to an external monitor, plugging in the charging/speaker/USB cables into the laptop obscures the lower part of the external monitor somewhat, but is minimal if you position the cords so they route underneath the stand.CONCLUSION: Best looking, functional stand for my MacBook available!"
5,great product,"perfect to set up your laptop at your home or work desk when you're not on the go. it is well built (aluminum), light (weight) and perfectly finished (mat silver). the design is amazingly sound: height and inclination of the keyboard. i use a bean bag for my elbows so they don't rest directly on the desk (i am a sensitive guy!)the only con (i can't take a star for that) would be the size. be sure to check the size to see if it is adequate for your laptop (i have a 15"" pc laptop and it holds it ok ... but that's the maximum size). enjoy."
5,Clean design.,"Great design, consistent Apple look, functional. If you are looking to elevate your macbook or macbook pro, this is the best solution. Keyboard stows nicely below stand, freeing up desk space. Cord hole in back has plastic liner to prevent cord wear. Large rubber pads on base and platform make this a number one choice."
4,mStand Laptop Stand,"Arrived quickly, attractive and helps keep my cpu cooler as I'd hoped. Substantial (apparent) aluminum seamless design. I'm generally pleased with it. The only difficulty I have with it is its height which, while using my laptop, is hard on the outer aspect of my palms. I plan on looking for small, flat gel pads to help with this and then I suspect there will be no problem."
4,Good Design,This stand is awesome... it is a simple design and works well to keep my MacBook Pro cool! I recommend this stand if you run a MacBook Pro or any other laptop!
5,Great Stand,I bought this stand a couple years ago with my mac book pro and it loos wonderful next to the cinema display. The slope is steep but the notebook when fully opened is still 90 degrees to the desk and easy to view. There is a slot in the front so it is easy to open the cpu without having to move it from the stand.
4,Very Functional. Highly Recommended,"I'm very please with this laptop stand. I have a 17"" Mac Book Pro which fits well on the stand. My laptop does stick out about a couple of inches on each side because of its width, but this has no effect on balance or stability. Because of the stand, the laptop sits higher which improves my sitting posture. I don't have to slouch to read my emails. The notch on the front allows easy access to the release latch, so I don't have to lift up the laptop to open it. Impressive design."
4,Nice stand for MBP Retina and Thunderbolt Display,"Holds up the MacBook Pro with Retina at good height with Thunderbolt Display. Cable management isn't brilliant, fortunately cables aren't really an issue. Not sure about some reviews suggesting this stand can serve as a heat sink - my Mac is never all that hot that it would use a heat sink like this but it is solid aluminum construction so... To each their own."
5,awesome,"Although this stand is expensive.... It IS worth the money. It looks great on my desk and feels sturdy. I do not regret spending the money and there are way to many times I buy stuff for my home office and regret the purchase due to a cheap look or feel, this is NOT one of them. Overall this is a great purchase for anyone who has other Apple products and wants a universal clean look."
3,Hard to Type,"I bought this a couple months ago from the Apple Store. My 15"" MBP fits perfect on it, although I have to admit it's hard to type on at that elevated height. If I have to do extended typing, I don't use it. But it's perfect if I'm just surfing the net. I also have an iPad, so if I tilt the stand toward me so the ledge is sitting on the desk, it makes a perfect kickstand for watching movies!It's good quality, although if I didn't have a gift card I wouldn't have bought it at retail price because of the difficulty/awkwardness to type on it."
4,mStand by Rain Design does the job,"My neck strain is significantly reduced by using this laptop stand to raise my 17"" PowerBook G4 screen to eye level while using an external keyboard/mouse. It doesn't swivel. It doesn't adjust for various heights. It just solidly holds my Mac when I use it on my desktop. Good job rain design!"
4,Not compatible with some laptop heat profiles,"So here's the deal: This stand is epic except that whatever glue they use for the friction pads will eventually break down when exposed to higher temperatures. If your laptop has hotspots where the friction pads would end up (remember the dimensions are 10 x 9.3), then over time they will slip out of place and your laptop will slip out of place with it. In my experience, it's been a very gradual thing so I've never felt my laptop to be in any risk from it - just more of a minor annoyance. When I get around to it, I'll find an appropriate glue to reattach the pads more permanently.Other than that, this stand is perfect for a faux dual monitor setup with my desktop using Synergy."
4,Eases neck strain,"This stand will work with most laptops. It helped ease my husband's neck strain when working with his laptop on his desk. He is 6' 4"" and this is working very nicely for him. Sturdy and easy to move out of the way when not using it. Computer just sits on top of it. A bit pricy, but helped make him a lot more comfortable."
4,"Expensive, simple, and well-made","mStand is a well made (solid piece of aluminum) stand, that's a bit on the expensive side but should last a lifetime. It's not at all adjustable though, so keep that in mind."
5,Space Saver,I love this product it keeps my MacBook at just the right height and keeps the air flowing underneath it to keep it cool. My husband saw it on [...] and knew that's exactly what we were looking for.
5,Powerbook's & MBPro's unofficial companion.,"I've been using this stand for several months. It's just the right height, very sturdy and matches the appearance of my Powerbook G4 perfectly. I'm delighted to read in the reviews of others that it works well with the new ""unibody"" styles, too. I plan to eventually buy one of those.On the ""attributes"" ratings which Amazon provided, I rated each category five stars except for ""functionality,"" which gets only four. This is for the very minor flaw that the front lip (which keeps the laptop from sliding forward) covers, if you center it, the CD drive. Again, this is minor, especially since it's only applicable to the pre-unibody models. The unibody MacBook Pros have a side-loading slot.Overall, a visually appropriate, ultra-sturdy and ergonomically well-designed stand.-Chris H."
5,"sturdy, stylish and the right height","This laptop stand fit the bill perfectly - is is sturdy, puts my ThinkPad at just the right height and is stylish to boot!"
5,YES!,"I've got a 13 inch MBP and this stand absolutely perfect!SImple, clean, minimilist design.Super sturdy.Two thumbs up."
3,Great product with one glaring flaw,"This product is stable, organizes your cables, and looks great with any MacBook Pro. The glaring omission is Rain Design's failure to cut out a small opening in the support bar for the laptop lid push-release button. This means that EVERY time you want to open your MacBook Pro when it's in the mStand you have to lift up the whole laptop, push the release button, and then set it down again in the mStand. And because you have to raise the entire laptop up and down every time you want to press the lid release button, the adhesive bumpers that protect the finish of the laptop case from getting scratched loosen up and fall off."
5,Perfect,"This stand is perfect as far as I'm concerned. It securely holds my MacBook Pro at a an excellent height to avoid neck strain. It allows unobstructed access to the front, back and sides of my laptop. The non-slip pads not only keep my laptop securely positioned, they also keep my laptop cool. The base's clean design allows ample room to shuffle papers around on my desk. And, to top it off, it looks really cool!"
4,Simply solid,"This product looks and works as expected. For those afraid of the reviews saying it doesn't work for 17"" macs, never fear, your computer will fit fine. It does what it says and looks like it was made by Apple. Height is obviously an issue for some, but I feel like if you have the right desk height and chair height, you shouldn't expect this product to adjust as well. The height feels great to me.My only complaint is there is some ""bounce"" with my 17"" macbook. Meaning when i type directly on the laptop on the stand, the whole thing flexes and bounces. It's a little annoying. I hope to get myself a wireless keyboard and mouse alternative to solve this problem. If you aren't touching the laptop, then its just what you want."
4,Usher is a great dancer,"..So why doesn't he hardly ever dance in this movie! He gets 4 stars because I thought he did a good job acting. I found it to be somewhat annoying that every single female that he passes melted in front of him. He is cute but u gotta admit if he wasnt THE famous USHER that no one would really be all that into him. I wasnt so into any of the other characters though. The white guy who wants to be black ""Junior"" is the worst. He needs to be kicked in the head. The storyline was cute though.. I just wished some better acting was performed."
3,Where's the Mix?,"The movie was okay for one of Usher first love movies but it seemed like he was acting to up tight. I might have been a little better if the movie had more mix to it then a love story. It was like every love or romance or whatever you want to call. Girl falls in love with boy, boy falls back in love. He has another girl dumps her gets with the other girl. They have a love seen, they love each other like to love birds. Something happens to one of them. Same romance story. It would of been a lot better if they were a lot more funny and more music. Some girls might think that it was Usher's best, but sorry Usher uh uh uh no baby sorry."
3,Color shift from Shaft?,"Who is that girl? The black guy thinks she's to die for?!Funky has turned and the club is still there, butGang Banger, now, means black or Mexican.And they are meaner than you can believe?The MOB still is scary, but not like the black scene.So a girl who is in a law degree might look tokeep her family current by pulling in a black guy.One with guts and a good ear too?Old guys get slow and young guys arein the know..."
1,Awful,This movie was awful. I bought it because I love Emmanuelle Chriqui as an actress. She's really coming up and getting her name out there. This movie was very disappointing. I was very bored the entire time. I finally shut it off in the middle of the movie. Do not buy this movie unless you really have nothing better to do.
2,MY EYES! THEY BURN!!!,"in the mix, were do I begin. this movie is a load of [...]! in the begining of the move, usher says ""I don't know about ya'll, but I know about us, and uh? it's the only way we know how to rock."" how corney is that? copying things from your own songs. the movie was Basically about: some black guy Trying to Protect some ""WHITE GIRL""! it's a movie with a bunch of Sexual remarks.(Well...no one was Actually having sex.)and let us not forget the language! Towards the end of the movie, SOME ONE SAID THE ""F"" word! (me: DUN DUN DUUUUUN!!!) I didn't know you could say the ""F"" word in a PG-13 movie.and there is Nudity at the begining.(no, really! you see some girl's rump at the begining.but on the on the plus side, usher's a good actor.BUT PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!"
5,simple and does the trick!,these are no nonsense forks. great price- get a couple sets. they clean up easy too. we've used them for spider dogs and smores. they will fit 2 marshmallows easy- you could actually cram 2 on each side for a total of 4 but I like mine toasty on all sides so i squished one marshmallow over both prongs at once-keeps them from spinning around too. great value. and if you lose one out camping no big deal they aren't real expensive. would be a great gift basket item when packaged with all the smore ingredients!!
5,For romantic nites only!!,Picked up this CD from the artist at a Street Fair on Union Street in San Francisco many years ago. This has been the soundtrack for uncountable and very memorable romatic evenings over the years.It is truely one of the best....
1,Survivor CD,"This CD has nothing to do with ""Survivor"", so if your here because you're a fan of the show DO NOT BUY IT! This CD should'nt even be listed under Survivor. If you are a fan of oldies and most likly never heard of Survivor (I don't know how you're here but...) go ahead and knock yourself out."
3,A Doggy Story,"In my opinion, I think that Walter's Tail is one of the best children's stories that I have ever read. It's about an old lady, Mrs. Tully whose friends suggest her to get a dog so she isn't lonely. So she gets a puppy and names it Walter, and Walter loves to wag his tail--he wags it constantly. Eventually he grows into a big dog and his tail-wagging begins to cause problems. The same friends that wanted her to get Walter in the first place now think he's too wild. This saddens Mrs. Tully and she leaves town, but I won't tell you if she and Walter return or not. You'll just have to read it for yourself and find out."
1,BIG Dissapointment,"Was pretty impressed by the design of the watch but was very dissapointed that the watch died on me 2 days ago, slightly 2 months plus just after i bought it (bought on 17 Oct 2006). Despite it was on discount, but I am still paying more than US$100 for it!! I lives in Singapore and purposely to engage my Friend who happened to fly to US for business trip to hand carry back for me, now that no Invicta outlet in Singapore, I am completely lost, do not know what should i be doing with my Invicta Women's Cellestial Chronograph Brown Python Watch #2607."
5,Outstanding,"If you enjoy Ottoman Turkish music, then I recommend this CD. The quality of this music is simply wonderful. While sitting back and relaxing, it's like going back in time when you listen. The clarity of the CD makes it sound like the music is being performed right in front of you.If you're a collector of Ottoman Turkish music, as I am, then you must get this CD."
5,Superb book!!,This is the most beautiful book I've ever read! Full of adventure and love. Mother bear is stern but her love and care for her cubs is so adorable. I cry like a child when I read this book.Really I recomend to all specialy a bedtime story! Boxer the little bear learns important lessons in his life but with the tenderness of his mother's touching love! Highly recommended!!
5,Wonderful book!,"Such an incredible book. Padel writes a novel like a poem, and captures the essence of the tiger and why it is so important that we save it from destruction in the wild. A must read for everyone."
5,Quality,"I already had a few years of experience with Matlab before purchasing this book, but I still found it to be very useful. It goes through the usual introductory concepts, but then dedicates a significant portion of the book to science and engineering related discussion, which may be useful to those new to Matlab and interested in its field-specific applications. Retuning to the usual introductory concepts, after years of exerience, I found most of it to be ""old news"", but there were still some elementary functions that I was unaware of and coding techniques that together allow me to write shorter, more time-efficient, and more readable (to outsiders) code. Buy it!"
4,great resource,this is a great resource to have to anyone who works with matlab for engineering purposes. good examples and not hard to follow.
2,not for someone new to MATLAB,This book is not a begginers text. Examples are all geared towards engineering which makes it hard to grasp the concepts of MATLAB. You spend a lot of time figuring out what the heck the equation means/represents and have little time left to really solve problems. I recommend starting with a book to learn the basics and if you need to learn more than get this book. This is a graduate level textbook if anything. There are also numerous mistakes and errors in the typing. Most errors are found in the end of chapter problems. Also there are no solutions in the back of the book to assist you in learning how to do the problems. Overall I would never recommend this book to any one new to MATLAB or to anyone that is not planning on using MATLAB extensivily in their particullar field of engineering.
4,Enough Roeg in the first hour,"The first hour of this Nicolas Roeg film is vintage Roeg: otherworldly, mysterious, kinky, violent, mesmerizing, confounding. All of the good stuff. The second hour is a drawn out courtroom drama concerning the events of the first hour that is equally confounding, but negatively so. Roeg aficionados should jump at the chance to purchase this. It is a rare find on Amazon.com. I tend to watch the first hour repeatedly and skip the ending. Not a bad thing, actually, as there is enough Roeg to go around the first hour."
3,Hackman Does Roeg,"Inspired by the sensational, unsolved Sir Harry Oakes murder case, this tantalizing film from director Nicholas Roeg stars Gene Hackman as one of the world's richest men. He found his fortune in gold in the wilds of Canada during the 1920s and now (during WW2) resides on a private island in the Bahamas.Passion has gone out of Hackman's life. His only interest these days is daughter Theresa Russell, but he's disappointed that she has married fortune hunter Rutger Hauer.Hackman is also under pressure from Miami mobsters Joe Pesci and Mickey Rourke to sell them his island, so that they can build a casino.Visually stunning, if somewhat confusing, Roeg's film is filled with fine performances and mystical elements that will compel viewers to return for a second and third look.Michael B. Druxman"
5,Classic Roeg - multi-layered & sophisticated,"Drama, based on real events, takes a poetic look at sexual politics and money. Firstrate cast conveys a sultry isolated society under attack from the mainland mafia of Miami."
1,Eureka with Gene Hackman,"One would imagine that after the fact, Gene Hackman was not happy he had played lead in this movie. The directing must have been non-existent - the camera work bounces all over the place (distractingly so) -- the plot is hard to follow. Glad I did not pay a full price for this - part way through I shut it off... later tried to finish it. Gene Hackman is usually in great movies - in this case, Forget it."
1,Give your 13.99 to the poor instead!,"Obviously I'm not sophisticated enough to appreciate this gory bore! Whatever! It was so awful I didn't even notice the usually outstanding actors (That was Gene Hackman?) In every review I read before I bought this no one ever mentioned the disgusting gore, nudity, or sick voodoo scenes. If I would have known, I never would have bought this piece of junk. I threw it in the trash (after I smashed it in to little bits). Oh by the way, the plot stinks too."
1,Very hard to type with,"The concept is great, it's quiet, good for travel or packing away. But you have to press the buttons too hard to get them to work, so you can't type very fast. Good for hunting & pecking, but that's about it."
3,Not bad not great.,"Good functional keyboard, not the easiest to type on, nothing compared to a wireless Microsoft keyboard but acceptable. Easy to store and carry around."
1,Would be nice if you could type on it,I purchased this keyboard because I am a slob and my office mates at work complain I bang on my keyboard. I really wanted to like this product but it has some serious design flaws. The top layer of the keyboard that contains they keys was not stable and it was really difficult to type without missing letters.
4,very cool!,This is a great keyboard for houses with messy kids and/or lots of pet hair. It takes a while to train your fingers to type correctly (the keys don't go down and bounce back up like a traditional keyboard)--but you can't beat the ease of clean up on it!
1,Don't waste your time.,"I had one of these for all of five days before I sent it back. While it was portable, flexible, silent, and capable of rolling up to fit into a pocket, it was also too unresponsive to touch typing. To accurately register typed characters, I had to resort to two-fingered hunt-and-peck typing because using all ten fingers was just too much for it. Even when I did so, about thirty per cent of the time characters would simply not register. On top of all of this, the amount of force necessary to make the keys register keypresses aggrivated my RST, which was the final straw. I've returned my Virtually Indestructible USB Keyboard."
3,Love the concept - needs work,"I always have a cup of coffee near my keyboard & I found my wrists hurting from the odd angle of a regular keyboard, so I thought I had found the solution. I tried it for a week, but found I was making too many mistakes & cutting down my typing time because I couldn't hit the keys hard enough to make them register (especially with my left hand. I finally reinstalled my old keyboard. This would be great in a hazardous area (like the kitchen) where spillage or damage is an issue. Otherwise, stick to the regular style keyboard if you have to type more than a line."
2,Cool idea- poor implementation,"This is a nice keyboard for any area where spills occur frequently, but the layout and design of the keys make it unsuitable for regular use. The 'wake', 'sleep' and 'power' keys are just above the numeric keypad and just to the right of the pause key. I keep trying to pause my favorite game and keep winding up in the hell that is sleep/wake mode. The keys require an inordinate amount of force to use. The backspace and delete keys are actually smaller than the alphabetical keys, making them much harder to find when you make a mistake.This is the perfect keybord for any unusually strong, thin-fingered flawless typists or for anyone who really has to type while in the bath tub. For the rest of us, this is more of a novelty item."
4,The key word is virtually.,"We have purchased several of these keyboards for use in a quiet enviornment. While they are very quiet, the ""touch"" takes getting use to. We have also had to replace a few, but the company has been good about that."
2,virtually useless,"I bought this several months ago to use with my slate tablet when I wanted to/had to use a keyboard. For awhile it generally worked, although the keys are very gummy and you need to press them very firmly when typing. But that's OK. What's not OK is that after very light use, the keys for all numbers other than 5 and 6 have stopped responding, along with all of the corresponding shift-keys--parenthesis, the ""at"" sign for e-mail, etc.--I can't type them because I'm using this piece of junk now. You can't appreciate how irritating it is to work without number and the other keys until you are forced to do it. Stay away from this virtually useless product."
2,"Not ""Virtually Indestructible"" at all.","Picked this keyboard up so I could roll it up and throw it in my backpack when doing field work on POSes. It worked for about 4 months, then I noticed when I press certain keys, it would add extra characters from nearby keys. Now the problem spread through most of the keys, and it's unusable. Definitley no ""Virtually Indestructible."" Looking for a better alternitive now."
5,"""Day Two"" review","If you like music in the vain of Coldplay, Radio Head, U2, The Flaming Lips... then ""Day Two"" is a must. Actually, a good portion of the songs off of the album are just as good if not better than those of Thom Yorke, Chris Martin, etc...Standout tracks are ""A New Beginning,"" ""Can't Find A Way,"" ""Always Tomorrow,"" and ""Secret."""
3,The basics,"This book is very very basic. I'm surprised at Jose the bowlers' review. He could only have been talking about conventional vs fingertip drilling as this book does not address the layout and drilling of a bowling ball at all. It is scorekeeping and the pin numbers and basic information about lanes and four steps. For a very raw beginner or teaching a class of beginners, it would work."
3,comfy yet some pain,"First time owner of Clark shoes. They are comfortable except for the inside part of my upper feet-There is pain where the foot presses on bed of shoe (just down from the big toe where foot curves outward a bit. It presses where the edges meet. I also wear a wide and so I ordered wide. These shoes must be overly wide because they are very loose. I wish the bottom of the shoe was leather also. Pretty, but some faults."
1,DOA After 23 months,Bought this tv on nov 26 2006. We are getting a white screen. For a $319.00 tv you would think the tv would last more then 23 months. Called the polariod company they told us that it is the video card in the tv. They are willing to sell us other one for $155.00 plus pay to ship to broken one back to them. I will not be buying anymore polariod products when I fell that they are not willing to stand by their products and not telling customers that there is a problems with the video cards in these tvs.
1,Avoid this item at all cost.,"I have had my TV for 7 months. I have sound, such that it is, but no picture, just a white screen. After mine went out, I started checking on the internet and found 3 out of 5 had the same problem anywhere from 1 month to 13 months.....I called Polaroid and they said to return my TV. I am just waiting to see if I ever get a replacement TV. I am not very confident, went and bought a Sony today.Don"
2,Nice while it lasted!,"We used this primarily as a computer monitor for our laptop, while docked--so it wasn't used all that much. It died about 2 years after use. Same thing happened with our 40"" TV. The blue light shines, but there is no picture. So sad. Waste of money."
3,A Hottie,Easy to install with tubing included. Unit heated as expected but had a realtively short life considering low usagein one year.NJDaddy
5,Excelente,"Muy buen servicio, rápido y eficiente, estamos contentos con el servicio prestado.Seguiremos comprando a través de esta compania, su trabajo es muy bueno, estamos contento."
5,Woman's prespective,One morning I went to Panera Bread for coffee and a book club of about eight middle aged women were discussing this book. I overheard some of their comments and decided to buy the book myself. I did read it from cover to cover. I thought It was a really good book for women who have a strong Christian faith. It also gave me some insight in how my wife looks at our marriage and what she wants from me. It is a short book and very easy to read. I recommend it to any married man who wants to better understand his wife.
2,Comanche,"This film is a good idea that doesn't quite come off. That idea is to humanize the famous Comanche leader Quanah Parker; however, Kent Smith, a good actor, does not really seem to fit the role. The film does have good action sequences, and also introduces the lovely Linda Cristal in her first starring role."
4,"Underrated, solid ""oater""","Thanks to Amazon.com for making this video available. COMANCHE is a solid, goodish 1950s Western, with good action, good acting, and colorful cinematography. No, it's not SHANE or THE SEARCHERS, but it is entertaining and worth an occasional viewing. You will not be disappointed."
1,Latin to the core...,"I spent years studying and performing the church music of The West.The Latin influence in virtually all of those great compositions became second nature to my ears.When I discovered Eastern Orthodoxy and Orthodox Christian Chant, it was as if someone had scraped away 10 centuries of paint layers from an old building, revealing something quite simple yet very profound.There is no doubt that this CD is very well produced.However, the very title gives it away as--at best--a distortion of the Russian Chant which was born of Moscow's mother, Constantinople.The term ""medieval"" is a western and Latin term, as is ""Deisus"".The political and social ramifications of monarchies in the rationalistic Latin West were of a totally different paradigm than that of the mystical, logical Greek East.Give this as a gift to someone who is not well schooled in music, and they will likely enjoy it simply for the good production.Give this to a Russian and you will greatly embarrass yourself."
3,The difference between film and theatre,"This is a one-woman stage show performance that has been filmed. If we were part of the theatre audience we would have seen Julie Harris as a three-dimensional figure and the stage props as guides and supports to her performance. As a cinema product, the effect is strictly two-dimensional and the stage props are, if anything, impediments to our imagination. Harris gives a forceful and nuanced reading, and I suppose there is a case that can be made for preserving it on film for students of the craft. Whether the play itself is that good, I have my doubts. Clever and amusing it may be, but the portrait of Emily Dickinson conjured up seems too flirtatious and dizzy for the writer of the cool and measured verse we know and love. But each to his own conception.The filming itself is not impressive: a couple of cameras; no real sense of intimacy. The quality of the sound and image is just passable, no better."
5,Theatre magic,"I saw this years ago, and just recently rediscovered it. I remember watching Julie Harris and wondering who is this woman? I ran right out and rented ""A Member of the Wedding,"" ""The Haunting,"" ""East of Eden"" and ""I Am a Camera."" However, it is ""The Belle of Amherst"" which remains dearest to my heart. Such a loving portrait. A bravura performance which earned the actress her fifth Tony Award for Best Actress, as well as a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Recording. This is a must for poetry lovers and theatre lovers alike."
2,Disappointing,"I've read and enjoyed other books in this series. But the last one I read was for 5 year-olds. Since then, parenting has been a joy. But as my son approaches his 10th birthday, his behavior lately has been baffling. A dizzying array of being un-reasonable, clinging, forgetful, competent, independent and non-responsive. I ordered this book for help. It gave me one or two clues, but it seemed like it was written while the author was waiting for a bus. The book was very shallow, much too brief, with frustratingly incomplete case studies. I read the whole book in about 20 minutes. I felt ripped off. There has to be something better out there about understanding 9-11 year-olds."
5,Excellent book on the cultural/social history of the deaf,"For a long time I have been searching for such book like this! It is excellent resources for the people, who are interested to learn American Sign Language, to become aware of richly deaf cultural/social history. The authors know where to find such wealthy of information, yet their writings are brevity along with several examples of where the deaf people have been interacted in order to preserve their cultural-linguistic connections. I highly recommended this book to the education and medical personnel to see how the deaf people are evidently happy with their livings without being heavily corrected on their hearing loss."
5,This should be reprinted!,"I was sorry to see that this was out of print. In fact I just read it tonight to my youngest child. This book has been a favorite of all three of my kids! Mark Teague is terrific. This book is fast paced and easy enough for even the youngest child to understand. The illustrations are pure hillarity! I also recommend ""The Secret Shortcut"" and ""The Lost and Found""."
5,Adorable,This book is super fun to read. I took it out of the library for my 3 year old son about six times. The art is incredibly creative as well. I cannot understand why this book is out of print. That's poor advertising because the book is just plain awesome.
3,for the record...,"I just want to point out that, yes, Dr. Sattilaro died in 1989, as one of the reviewers points out. However, Dr. Sattilaro died of pneumonia, not prostate cancer. I also met him in person about a year before his death. He had by then stopped following the recommendations he describes in his book and he was very weak. I'm not rating this book [...]because I don't want to influence anyone. Read the book and make up your own mind."
5,Recalled by Life,"Fabulous autobiographical story about a Philadelphia physician and hospital administrator who has metastatic prostate cancer. One day, feeling hopeless, and resigned to an early and painful death, he picks up some hitchikers. They ask him why he is so depressed, and upon hearing about his condition, they pronounce it not so difficult to cure. Of course, the Dr. is very skeptical, but he agrees to meet their friends and so is introduced to macrobiotics. The book is about Dr. Sattilaro's healing journey and how his new macrobiotic food and friends help him return to good health and give him back his life.To Dr. Sattilaro's surprise, the life to which he returns is much richer and filled with infinite gratitude.A great read. Highly recommended."
4,Great Book to fight cancer,Had this book years ago and loaned it out and never got it back. I have thought of it over the years and was glad to get a hard-backed copy at an affordible price. Fast shipping and a great book.
1,A dangerous and misleading book,Readers of this outdated book should look into the background of its author who is reported to have died in 1989. As a cancer patient myself I resent the misinformation from books such as thi
1,A Lot Missing,"This DVD is not worth it. Not only is the narrator difficult to understand when attempting to say the locations in spanish, it's a travesty that so much of this beautiful island is not even mentioned. Only La Habana and Pinar del Rio, while beautiful, are mentioned. The rest of the island is ignored. Not worth the money. Such a shame when one had high hopes of seeing the whole island."
5,Real Eye Candy,Beautiful shirt. Great material and fit. Fast shipping. I have a lot of Hawaiian shirts but this is the best. Very cool and wears great without a lot of wrinkles.
2,sized wrong,this was supposed to be a 4X sized shirt and was not even close. I have many shirts this size and roomy and comfortable. no way it was a size 4X; closer to 2X. Not very happy.
5,kick ass movie!!!,"I really get a kick out of the older biker movies, i remember when i was young staying up half the night waiting for one to come on, the glory stompers was one of my favorites,"
3,Phony Biker Flick.,Dennis Hopper is probably the best actor in a rather lame motorcycle classic. To much lovy dovy and a rather lacking luster concept ofwhat these Bikers really are all about. I think it's a hastily concerted script. Technical aspects are not very good. Can't recommend it.
5,great price,This nail varnish was priced well. It was well packed and shipped quickly. Thanks I would use this vendor again.
3,Helps Somewhat,"I have very weak nails. This product helps somewhat but certainly is not a cure-all. My nails still chip and break easily, but the peeling is getting better."
5,Great Job,This was a re-order for the product and needed it quickly. The vendor promised delievery within a reasonable time. The vendor exceeded my expectations by delievery within a much shorter period. Highly recommend using them in the future. JJF
1,waste of money,"I seriously cannot believe that this is the same author that wrote the blood bond series.I mistakenly brought all the books in this series instead of just buying the first book to see if I liked it, especially after really enjoying the blood bond series. I wasted so much money.The storyline is very childish and continues throughout the series. I made it to the forth book and it still didn't get any better.I cannot believe how many 5 star reviews there are, if you are reading this review and decide to buy the book then buy one at a time and seriously buy the blood bond series instead of this series as it was really good buy.I am only glad that I read the other series first because if this was my first book from this author I wouldn't recommend buying any."
2,producer's dream to mate Kinski and Nureyev on screen,"Exposed. No jugs, no hips, lizard's belly yet sensual faceNo chemistry with a raving queer yet a great tribute."
2,could be so much better,"I grew up on the Cape, so naturally I was very excited when we were there visiting family and my daughter received this book as a gift. Unfortunately, my excitement was short-lived. I understand that this is a children's book and therefore the story is supposed to be simple, but the writing was irritatingly bad. It felt hollow and unimaginative. I was also not a fan of the illustrations, which were rather simple and cartoonish, but I see in the product description that the artist is a comic strip illustrator. Overall, very disappointing."
4,"Great Album, must have!",This is a great album and a must for anyone looking for some of the music you will hear on the radio in Hawaii. It will make you feel like you are in paradise again. Give it a try!
4,"Works great, but a strange layout","The keyboard works very well, no problems there, and a terrific deal for the price. The only thing I don't understand though is why the spacebar is split into 3 keys, and backspace, enter, and left shift are each two keys."
3,It's just ok,"I had bought this as a spare keyboard for my laptop. It may be slightly better for typing on than the laptop keyboard, but I cannot touch type on it. The keys are not very responsive. They kind of wiggle, so it's difficult to judge when you've actually depressed the key. Perfect for throwing into your laptop bag or for a hostile or wet environment (repair shop, garage, etc). Otherwise, pass."
3,"12' not 15"" (wrong one?)","What I got was probably the wrong keyboard, but I didn't realize right away. I couldn't find this product to review it. Still, if they are sending this wnen you order the above product, I think it is right to reveiw it here. The thing they sent is 12"" not 15"". The right arrow key doesn't work. The keys are weird, since they wiggle to one side or the other as you strike them. So, it throws you off."
4,"Good, gory fun!","Having nothing to do with the first CURSE film, this flick is the story of a young couple traveling across the southwestern US who decide to take a short-cut through an abandoned nuclear testing site. BAD IDEA. In one of the most hilarious scenes of 80s horror, the kids' truck suddenly runs across a highway FULL OF SNAKES. We're talking HUNDREDS of them. Eventually the guy gets bit by one of the radioactive snakes, and from then on he's slowly changing and mutating into one! The end of the film is one of the grossest scenes I can ever recall watching, and I've seen plenty of gory stuff. While the whole movie isn't on par with classics like DEAD ALIVE or the first two EVIL DEAD movies, there's still plenty of goofy stuff and gore galore to keep you entertained. And then there's Jill Schoelen, the absolute QUEEN of bad 80s horror movies. Quite the doll, she is, and in top form in this flick. Good, fun stuff! I can't wait to order it!"
1,"Funky, out-there, just plain fun story!","It's a really odd world of the future, but very well constructed. With a very breezy, funky style, this is a new take on the robot/human conflict that runs all the way from Florida to the Moon where the Boppers grow human organs in ""pink tanks"" and the aging human population can look forward to uploading their consciousness for later life. Very mind-bending in a way, but fun reading, not so ponderous and dark as a lot of sci-fi tends to be."
5,If there ever was an All-In-Wonder this is it!,"All anyone has to do is read the label on this and understand its ingredients. The human body needs so much more than we give it in order for it to survive in this world! Today's commercial over-processed and hormone induced foods are polluted with chemicals, depleted of vital enzymes and nutrients that are essential to our body for it to function properly. Ever wonder why there are so many drugs for everything? If your body is working right it will not require medications, therein which can cause side effects that require more drugs etc. By the way, Drug companies don't care about you! As long as you are sick they get paid! Health is bad business! But that is a separate issue all together. This is one of the best whole food supplements available! Start with two a day then work up to three. Powerful stuff! Do your research and be good to your body!"
5,The Cadillac of Vitamines,"These are the best vitamines that I have ever taken. They have everything that the body need in them. My sister is a kidney recipient as a result of lupus (a dreadful disease). And she was weak and tired all the time as you can imagine. After taking these, she doing so much better. Very active and full of life. Another thing, ordering from you I get these at half the price that I was getting them at the local health food stores. Thanks for a great product.Dr. Jacobs, DC"
4,Brillant movie,Brillant movie! It took quite some time for me to get it on DVD. Thanks Amazon.com! In germany you can buy only a VHS-version... :-(
2,"Eric Red's directorial debut ""Cohen and Tate"" follows ideas Red previously explored in his scripts for The Hitcher and Near Dark","Roy Scheider is more than competent in this thinly written, mildly exciting late 80s thriller. If you've seen ""The Hitcher"" or ""Near Dark"" you'll know what framework to expect of the film, just without true genuine menace or terror. MGM's technical presentation is also worth noting for leaving much to be desired. 2 stars."
1,Missing Pieces!!!,Product missing critical pieces.Mispresented in photo!Arrived damaged!Only includes a very thin bar. Not what the picture shows!
4,What s IQ Really?,"A fun book. Some of the puzzles aren't puzzles per se, but interesting thought-provoking pieces. Some of the other puzzles aren't that much fun, but most of them are, and I've bought many copies to give to friends."
2,"Incoherent and feeble, and the SF is egregious","Aliens are so last millennium, and so are most of these puzzles.One or two are interesting enough, but they're dressed up in such pretentious pseudo-SF twaddle that it's too much like hard work to figure out what the problem actually is. And most of them are childishly simple.The only reason why this gets two stars rather than the one it otherwise deserves is because of the philosophical questions asked and discussed.Fortunately it's not a big book. If you see it in a garage sale or a thrift store, pick it up if it costs no more than a dollar."
4,Dream Catcher,i've been an avid historical romance reader for years. I picked up this book at a local thrift store. I feel that this book put a lot of emphasis on the love that bloomed between Adam and bethany rose. Th revenge on adam's step brother took a back seat when they both discovered how much they loved and cared for each other. all in all this was a good book. i couldn't put it down.
4,Great Book on Prayer With A Chrismatic Slant To It,"Despite the fact that Jim Goll and I probably disagree over much of his charismatic theology, I found this book on intercessory prayer to be a good read. Goll uses church history particularly with the Movarians in Germany to show the power of believers coming together to pray. It is a true eye-opener to see just how far the modern Church has turned away from her secret to power and this is prayer. The book is quite easy to read and Goll does a good job of not overwhelming you in each chapter. He leads the story of the Movarians (and others) along with Scripture in each chapter to point the disciple to a deeper prayer life.Overall, despite Goll's charismatic theology and term usage, I found this book to be a good read and a faith builder on prayer."
3,"over long, too hollywood.","Other reviews have covered the story - based on true events - quite well. I thought the film was too long, more editing would have helped greatly. Also, as happens often in war movies, westerns - the actors do not look like they would in such conditions. The Hanna character looks like a NY model, she's beaten half to death, then suddenly she's back to looking like a NY model again, inexplicably. It's almost as if the director thought the final scene required the image of a beautiful woman being executed, as opposed to an ordinary person, to have an impact on the audience."
1,Zero for two,"I bought this and ""The Hiding Place"" at the same time. Two strikes on me. Both have similar themes - about different perspectives of Jewish people during World War II. ""Hanna's War"" is allegedly a true story, or perhaps based upon one, perhaps loosely based, as it seems rather modern in presentation and lacking in the feel of the 1940s. Very slow; very dull; you don't really get engaged with the characters. Being a war movie, some characters die, and you find yourself not caring, and in fact hoping that the writers, producers, directors, cast and crew will all be executed as well."
2,"Bad recording, hopefully","I heard this bad on AcidPlanet's website and immediately liked them. But his cd is very disappointing. The sound quality is horrible and their voices sound as if this is not one of their best performances, I would hope. I have not been able to see them perform live yet but after hearing this I'm not sure if I will. I would not recommend this cd to anyone. But I'm giving it two stars instead of one because this music is better than a lot of others out there."
3,Good read for just starting out on Amazon...,"Though this is well written and flows nicely, the author is painfully vague in many instances and doesn't elaborate where it would be most useful. If you have listed one item on your own through Amazon to sell, then you've already read over 1/2 this book. Many other reviewers were very accurate in their opinion that this information is on Amazon website already, free of charge. I bought the book anyway even after reading the reviews figuring maybe there was some secret knowledge it could impart. The only helpful pieces which I haven't tried yet were recommendations for searches and promotions, etc. Chapters are spread very thin; some items in the table of contents turn out to be a paragraph or 2 on one page and the onto the next chapter! I'll be relisting this incidentally because no one should pay more than $10 for this book."
1,Depends on your experience (and intelligence level),"If you have never purchased or sold anything on Amazon before ... or, if this is the first time you have ever logged on to the internet ... then this book might be for you. Or, if you've tried selling on Amazon and can't figure it out, this might be for you. Truly, this is for ""dummies"" only.I hope this doesn't sound tongue-in-cheeck - I'm really trying to be sincere. If you are of reasonable intelligence, and have used the internet, then you won't learn anything new here. A LOT of filler, no criticisms, no unique ways to use the site. And a LOT of buttering up Jeff Bezos...almost as if these two guys are wanting a job or something. (Or maybe they are somehow related to Amazon or Bezos?) Also, much of the book is already outdated.For me, this was a waste of time. For you...it all depends."
2,Out of date,"This book covers a lot of topics, ranging from screen by screen walkthroughs on how to create an account to how to set up an Amazon Auction or Amazon zShop.Unfortunately, some of this information is already out of date. For example, Amazon discontinued zShops entirely more than a year ago. I was disappointed with this book because I was looking for more insight than screen by screen walkthroughs. I can follow the instructions on the screen just fine, thanks."
5,newbie guideline to sell on amazon,"i have purchased this book when i started my online business and ""how to sell anything on amazon"" helped me a lot1)how to look for product to sell2)how to fixed price for product you are going to sell3)how to do shipping with cheap shipping label4) how to give good customer service5)how to maintian inventoryand lot of other thing related to any other online business.i would recommend this book those want to build their online business from stratch.please follow link below for more infoHow to Sell Anything on Amazon...and Make a Fortune!"
2,REVIEW ON BOOK How to sell Anything on Amazon....,This book is only for those already using Amazon because it contains old outdated information about Amazon that needs to be filtered out. If you are a novice to Amazon you will get a lot out of this but know that it is not the latest info on Amazon. In fact it must be at least 10 years old and they have changed a lot of things including their business model. Some things the book says you can do is no longer available. Other things that are new are not mentioned so you might want to find a 2008 publication or newer.But for $10 the book is worth every penny.
3,Great book for Beginners to Amazon,I would recommend this book if you are very new to Amazon or thinking of starting a business on Amazon.
4,Still Reading/Good/Informative,"I haven't read it all yet, but what I have read is very interesting, and very informative, since I hope to be a frequent seller on Amazon. It will also be part of my reference library for doing business online."
2,You get what you pay for,"I was hoping to buy a nice black wool tuxedo at a real bargain price. What I got was a ""dark-green-that-might-look-black-in-near-darkness"" wool tuxedo that was actually priced pretty appropriately. If only there were stores in town I could actually shop for a tuxedo at and see for myself what I'm getting before I buy it! Sadly, out here in the back woods, that's not really an option. So it looks like I'll be the ""cheap green tux guy"" at all the formals."
4,Great BIG Glasses,"Once you get past the packaging you will love these glasses. I was very concerned when I first opened the package to see dusty glasses in a flimsy box. However after a run through the dishwasher they quickly became a family favorite. Good shape, good weight, and great capacity make for a nearly perfect glass. The only negative(after packaging) is that the top half of the glasses are a little thin and we have broken one as it hit another glass while being removed from the dishwasher.p.s. - The 16 ounce glasses are unbelievable! Perfect for morning juice or an evening scotch."
4,Stellar stuff with saucy additions,"You've got to love the BeeGee's cover from the wild group that never seems to be content, Faith No More. I will admit that other previous issue of this Maxi-Single was better, but this one still adds a little bit of flair in the b-sides. It is probably only a wise purchase for true hardcore FNM fans. I give it a thumb up."
5,"Congratulations, all of you, on your fine, fine...","A toast! Tenure all around. Bravo, marvellous. All of you--really. Really, truly marvelous. So many insights. You've got Paris on the Iowa River out there, you really do. A round table to make King Arthur proud. A real Salon--Kantian style. Brilliant, on every possible level. So true, everything was so true; and so well-said, from start to finish. Not a word out of place. Ideal. Perfection! Stupendous! I can't rave enough. Tenure for everyone! On me!"
2,Nothing exciting,"This toy is okay,...Its not very exciting to play with, and yes the brain spins but its hard to get it to spin there is a little dial in he back that you have to turn..."
2,Cubix - Cerebrix action figure.,"My son ask me over and over ""what else does it do besides just stand there."" Cerebrix doesn't take much brain power to use, in fact the only thing it does is talk very loud and changes it's face expressions thanks to a very hard to turn device at the back of his head. There is no action to this figure at all!"
5,"If you're buying this as a gift, buy one for yourself too","I got suckered into buying this twice - first as a gift, and then I had to have my own! I've made the simple ballband washcloth, the ""absorba"" rug, and am eyeing the baby kimono. There are some very lovely patterns in here (I just haven't had time to try all the ones I want to), and the writing is downright entertaining. The Mason-Dixon web site is also very funny and has a great support group - you can see all the variations that people have done on patterns in the book."
4,Errata,Good but be sure to check the publisher's web site for corrections to patterns. Seems there's always some corrections in knitting books. I always check for them before I purchase a book so I don't attempt a pattern with mistakes. This isn't foolproof but it does help.
4,Hilarious,"I have yet to buy this book, but spent about an hour at the book store today looking through it. Long knitting stories aren't usually my thing, but I really enjoyed the chapters, stories, articles, and blurbs. It was absolutely hilarious!!! (I don't fall victim to mundane humor). The projects are different and interesting (I liked the new take on dishcloths, and the knitted slip and robe). Will definitely be purchasing in the near future...more for the writing than the patterns."
2,Not so great,"It's an okay book. However, beginners beware as the instructions are not crystal clear and not completely accurate. An e-mail to the author with a question was met with a response that suggested I was missing something that she feels is perfectly clear in the book. It's not. This only added to the disappointment. If you're looking for knitting comic relief, you'll have a good time reading about all of the well written knitting experiences. For me though, not worth the $$."
2,Please don't tempt us,"There are too many pictures in the book that have no pattern to go along with them. The book is disappointing at best. Next time, I'll wait until I can see it in a store before ordering from these two authors. I wouldn't have purchased it."
3,pretty but not much new,"this book is for the ""new knitter"" who has not been around much and has not seen many of these ideas in the original for. some cute patterns."
4,"If you are a beginning knitter, enjoy the stories","Not that there aren't projects in the book for a beginner, but there aren't many geared in that direction. Even those that are easy enough for beginners have instructions that look intimidating.I don't usually care for ""chatty"" books on crafts, but this one had me chuckling along with the gals. Makes me wish I was in a knitting circle with them.Enjoy the stories, work on the patterns you can and in the spirit of these two feisty authors ""just pick up the needles and make suff"""
5,10 Stars!!,"I read this book cover to cover in one evening.Firstly, it is well written. I was thoroughly entertained by Kay and Ann as I turned each page. Their ability to tell us exactly how they came up with the projects in the book was such a spark to my own creativity. I just love all the patterns (recipes) -- and have plans to make the curtain for our laundry room and kitchen (above the sink) windows. I also have purchased coned cotton to make a bathmat!!! And, last night I casted on and knit the center square for a log cabin blanket!! Of course, all my projects will be a little different from Kay and Ann's -- but that is the beauty of this book -- it gives you the freedom -- and impetus -- to strike out a little and go for it!I'll definately be pre-ordering any future books from these ladies. You really should go to the top of this page now and click the ""Buy"" button. You won't be sorry!"
3,Beware of all the errors.,"Nice book, but thank goodness I read the ONE review that warned of errors. Be sure to check publisher for corrections."
3,Mason-Dixon Knitting,didn't find many patterns I liked. Wouldn't recommend it to any of my friends. Too heavy to carry it around
2,It's Not All That,"Out of the 30 or so patterns here, I found 3 that I would ever consider taking the time to knit. The rest are garter stitch baby bibs and rugs made out of potholder loops and that ilk. If dishcloth cotton makes you swoon, this is the book for you. Not very sophisticated, not very appealing, and certainly not worth the price."
3,Mason Dixon Knitting,"Finally I got the book. Have been knitting the washcloths for a while, and love them. So I wanted the book to see what other treats are there.I'll not knit all of them, but there is a choice. I like the things that i can use around the house."
2,Ugly Projects,"I respectfully disagree with the other reviewers. I found nothing in this book that I would knit. The emphasis is on home decorating items, such as pillows. I sent it back the same day it came. Blessings to Amazon.com for a great return policy."
5,Functional and Fun; The New Knitting Book,I LOVED this book. I picked it up on a whim and spent the next two hours reading and laughing. The patterns are fun and these girls are so funny. I think this is a great book to have in my library. It has several patterns that I really want to make as gifts and I think even the book would make a great gift to any knitter.
5,Super Yoga program for beginners and those not physically fit,"I started this yoga program 2 years ago. I do Peggys DVD's four times a week and have developed better breathing, stronger muscles and my DECA scan (to check bone density)came back improved from two years ago. My digestive system has also improved. All in All a win win DVD."
3,Tricked into buying old Cappy DVD presented as new,"I too was tricked into buying this DVD not knowing it is just a repackaging of a DVD I already have. The year made is different, so I was fooled into buying this when I already had it.But I find Peggy Cappy's tapes to be helpful for a beginner or a person with physical limitations. The tapes are relaxing and very easy.You do not have to be in good physical condition to do the exercises. And you won't break a sweat using the tapes, but your body will be stretched and benefit from the practice. Yoga is so beneficial.My main complaint is Peggy goes so slowly, there is too much talking and some people will be bored. But being slow and unhurried is part of her calm style."
5,This Cd has the best reggae single of1999,"This CD was given to me by an old friend in Negril, He said you will like this one mon. He was correct. The song What Time Is It?, is the best song I have heard this year. The answer to the ? is the best time of your life. Give thanks & Praise"
4,lobob rewetting drops,These drops are the best that I can find on the market right now. My optomestrist recommended them. They work well and my contacts fit comfortably after using them. They work very well at flushing out any little particle that irritates my eye - and I don't have to remove my contact to do the flush.
5,Lobob WRW,"After storing in Lobob CDS for the nigh, rubbingt and rinsing in the morning, I use this to insert into eyes. No sting, no film or fog, and the best rewetting solution available for gas perm lenses."
2,Hooks are smaller than you would think,I was surprised to find that the hooks would not wrap around the rails on my car. If yours are wider than an inch the hooks will be too small.
5,An eloquently written guide for assisting young women on their path to discovering the better half of their artistic abilities,"An excellent and practical read which is very highly recommended to young women, especially those with artistic aspirations, Journal Buddies: A Girl's Journal For Sharing And Celebrating Magnificence by Jill Schoenberg Girma is an eloquently written guide for assisting young women on their path to discovering the better half of their artistic abilities. Readers will find easy access to their muse after reading through the delightful, idea-filled pages of Journal Buddies. Nearly every page has room to write so that the young women may write their thoughts on each given subject."
2,INCORRECT TRACKS LISTED,"in trying to find willie's version of ""everybody's talking""i've bought two of these disc from differentdealers but the songs listed are not what iwound up with(a minimal mix of two acousticguitars, bass & bongos of ""everybody's talking""can be found on the bmg cd willie nelson:""classic willie"" found here at an amazon dealer).i've sent art work of this disc and the back ofthe jewel box hoping to clear up the mix up. thesesongs are fake stereo at best with not so goodfidelity and hiss. i THINK these old tracks havebeen repackaged numerous times under different titles."
4,There is a video game too!,They also created a PC-video game based on this version. Its a good RTS game if you can find it.
5,a pleasant experience after the new dismal version,"After watching the dreadful mess called ""War of the Worlds"" at the movies, I went back to my stereo and put on Jeff Wayne's version and was awed as I have been so many times before. Just as H.G.Wells spun around in his grave upon hearing Tom Cruise ruin his story he must rejoice every time a fan is kept on the edge of their seat, as the Thunderchild tries vainly to save humanity from the evil tripods( a scene the was left out of the movie). If you realy want to expereince the War of the Worlds buy this CD and sit in your room an let the music, Richard Burton and Jeff Wayne give you an experience you will never forget."
4,An Almost Classic,"I fell in love with this recording when I was about 8, and the new remastered version has become essential buying since I've more or less worn out my parents' original cassette tapes!It's fabulously hammy and old-fashioned, but definitely fabulous. Both the setting and the music can transport you into a world long since passed away.There are some genuinely eerie and creepy parts of this, and some catchy singalong tunes - if you're in the right frame of mind, 'Forever Autumn' can be genuinely touching.Richard Burton's narration adds a pleasing depth to the whole piece. The second CD is slightly weaker, but worth persevering with.If you're a sci-fi fan, or a prog fan, or you just want to listen to something a little bit bizarre, check this out. I may be slightly biased by my childhood preferences, but there's still plenty here to interest those of a more adult mindset!"
5,Better Than Ever!,"I first heard this decades ago on a special edition direct-to-disc vinyl set. Once available, I bought the CD set. I received this version from my Son for Father's Day.The entire presentation is elegant, with impressive packaging, beatiful imagery, thorough content and, most of all, the re-mastered audio is exquisite!I considered ripping it to my MP3 player, but any reduction in quality at all would never do it justice.A must-have for afficianados of great production audio, not to mention, Impressive narration by the late Richard Burton."
1,Worst Crayola product ever!,"My daughter was so excited when she received this as a gift...until she opened it. The black plastic inserts fell out immediately, no matter which way we tried to tilt it while opening, making the already-flimsy case completely useless. Less than $5 worth of supplies were inside ~ save your money and buy them separately and put them in a shoebox, it will work better and last longer!"
1,Also disappointed,"I am also VERY disappointed in this case!!! My son excitedly picked this out and I thought it would be PERFECT for him to keep all his supplies together and he would be able to carry it out to use any time. Well, like everyone else has already said....the parts inside that hold all the crayons, pencils, etc, do not attach to the actual red case so every time we open and close the case everything falls out. It's so frustrating to my son that he doesn't use it anymore or just trashes it. SOooooooo mad that Crayola couldn't at least have attached the pieces together so they wouldn't fall out."
2,product description is inaccurate,I purchased this product (X 2) for $15.96 each. the description claimed that 24 markers were included. In actuality only 8 markers were included. the identical product was on sale at Target for $6.99. The only reason I did not return it was because of the hassle involved. I am very disappointed that I could not trust the description posted.
2,not a well-made set,"I bought this for my son who likes to create art. I figured the handy case would be easier for travel as it would contain everything he needed. Well, it stinks. The inside liner of the case falls out, the paint rounds dont stay in their plastic container at all. So you have to constantly put them back in everytime you open or close the case. This case is not worth it! My son just took all the stuff out and put it in other containers because he was tired of dealing with it."
2,cheap,"The supplies are the same as you would expect if buying individual crayola products. However, the black plastic inserts, and the red case it's self are made out of extremely weak plastic that doesn't hold anything together. Who ever was in charge of product design here decided that saving 3 cents on plastic was more important than delivering a quality product.I likely will be dumping all of these products in a Tupperware container as were my families previous arraignments."
2,Terrible carrying case,"I bought two of these as presents for my kids at a Black Friday sale for Christmas. Then I read the reviews on Amazon and ended up giving them as gifts in an exchange. We still ended up with one, someone gave one to one of my children. The crayons, markers... all high Crayola quality. She has enjoyed using them and she uses them a lot. But the whole purpose of this is to have a nice case to hold the product and keep them nice. The plastic inserts fell out the very first time we opened it. There is no way to anchor down the scissors or paintbrush or papers. When it's time to close it all up we just situate the items as well as possible them slam it shut in hopes that it all works itself out inside. :) TERRIBLE case."
2,"It's ok, but...","It's a collection of color pencils, crayons, markers, a few other odds in ends in what I'd consider to be a pretty cheap (not very durable) blue case, with a cheap plastic inserts (that falls out and is a pain whenever the kids try to close the lid) for holding the crayons/markers/pencils. Nothing special. You'd have a better set up buying the crayons/markers/pencils separately and using a plastic container to keep it all together."
1,"Cheap, cheap, bad quality","The whole thing just screams flaws and bad craftsmanship. The case is frustrating, when you want to close it, the inside of the top part keeps falling out, and with that come all the things in it. So my place is always flooded with the markers. The crayons you can buy at Target for 2 bucks, the coloring pencils are too small and thin for even school age kids and I could go on and on. Definitely would not recommend this set. The inner plastic broke after a week."
3,Not what I expected,Cheaply put together and does not include the things listed on the editorial review. I am extremely disappointed. The sides fall out when you close it making the crayons dislodge and roll around. It is obvious that hinges on the box will wear out quickly. I just cant believe it is such poor quality coming from Crayola.
2,Frustrating case!,"My daughter received this case as a birthday present for her 5th birthday and just loved it. She is ALWAYS writing, coloring or painting, and this case had it all in one organized place, which we were both thrilled about (myself more than her). After about 2 or 3 uses, the cases (the black plastic ones inside) both fall out every time she opens or closes it, along with 6 or 7 markers, pencils and crayons. She then has to spend 10 minutes trying to clean up and put it back together. It's very frustrating to deal with because they are so cheap and flimsy.The art supplies themselves are wonderful - Crayola has great quality products, but the inside black cases just make it not worth it. I'm looking for something different for her now that won't have her supplies constantly falling out."
1,Case is Cheap and Will Break Soon,"I wish I had realized there are reviews at the bottom of the page! The case is made of cheap plastic and the hinges will obviously not hold up very long. Worse, the black trays inside which hold the coloring tools are made of flimsy, filmy black plastic more appropriate for disposable or packing use! We had to use tape to secure the black trays to the case just to keep them from falling out. The markers do not stay in their holder well. I wish I had used my money to buy cool crayons and bought my own case separately. This was a great organizational concept but such poor quality, it ruins the whole item."
1,Everything falls out!,"This box is the bane of my existence. Because it's her ""art box"" my daughter won't let me throw it out, yet every time it's opened the plastic holder and all the supplies fall out. Plus, it's 10 times the size it needs to be for the stuff that's actually in it.The cheap plastic supplies holders don't hold all the supplies correctly and fall out. The markers fall out everytime it's opened.. If you find this box super cheap than I would rec'd getting it to replenish marker sets and things you already have. But it's not a good gift as an art supply box."
2,Super Flimsy,"I bought this for my 3-year-old last christmas because she loves to color, draw, and paint. But the case it comes in is very flimsy on the inside. When she opens it, the two ends fall out along with all of the supplies inside, so I have to put everything back into their places every time. Closing it is really hard, because you have to do it very carefully (for a 3 year old that is almost impossible), or else everything starts to fall out of it again. I think that this christmas I am going to purchase a nice art desk for her, or something better to store everything in than to mess around with this stupid thing. However, my daughter did enjoy all of the art supplies inside so that is why I am giving it four stars in fun"
1,Most things fall out when opening!,"The trays inside are very flimsy and many of the markers, crayons, pencils fall out when opening. For that reason my daughter doesn't really use this kit. There's also no place for the glue and pad of construction paper so that falls out too when opening. The no brand art kits sold at Micheals have cases where the supplies don't continually fall out and it's way cheaper when you use their coupon. I DO NOT recommend this kit!"
1,Don't waste your money.,"Don't buy! The black plastic things in the case are cheap and flimsy. They don't stay in the case. The products don't stay in the case. It looks pretty and organized in the photo, but only looks that way if you keep it lying flat and open."
2,NotAgain,"Paid almost $10 for this product. For the price, you get what you p ay for so to speak. Its not much. In fact had I bought these items in single purchases it would have cost less and I could have saved money."
2,Does not contain items listed,"My 5 year old son received this kit as a gift, and I came online to check to see what it contains. Listed in the product details it says 24 fine line markers, which it does not come with...but it does come with 8 of the fatter markers (as pictured). The strange thing is, there is an empty compartment for 12 fine line markers. I thought we lost those markers in the chaos of Christmas morning, but if you read the details on the front, no where does it list the fine line markers. Go figure, I find that confusing. The items do move around a bit as you try to close & secure the case but I find that happens with most items of this type."
2,Ok for the price,"I was hoping for something to time reactions for my son's science project. This is a game you play for points. It works, which for the price is fine, but it is not exactly what we needed."
3,It's no Wild Child,"This completes our set in the seasons series. Wild Child was our first experience with Plourd's books-- and by far, the best one. None of the other books seem to match up. Thus said, children and adults alike will still delight in the sing song phrasing and orginal artwork. The stories are favorites with my kids."
2,Beware: Does Not Fit Larger Hair Dryers,"I bought this diffuser, because the reviews said it had a large opening and would fit larger-sized hair dryers. This is not true. The diffuser itself is fine, but it doesn't fit larger hair dryers."
5,AWESOME! A MUST for ANY music collection!,"If you have an ear at all for a great pianist, you'll love this album! If you like New Age, you'll love this!One of the best and most innovative artist to come along in a VERY long time!Rated one of the top 100 new age albums of all time!Incredible - a MUST HAVE!"
4,A mature male buddy picture,"This is a low-key examination of two single men and the conflicts produced by the weaknesses of one of them (Peter Coyote). Coyote is a talented, but minor, painter who is self-absorbed to the point of self-destruction, and who is generally disdainful of the women he beds. He may have met his match in an exotic gallery manager, but his inability to deal maturely with success and women threatens his relationship with his best friend and anchor, Nick Mancuso. Tender moments and resolution keep this movie human and hopeful."
3,Whose hearts are broken?,"""Heartbreakers"" covers much of the same territory covered 10 years later in ""In the Company of Men"", but in a much more watchable and sympathetic way. While there are still times that I'd like to slap the lead characters Blue (Peter Coyote) and Eli (Nick Mancuso), they don't make my skin crawl like the guys in ITCM. ""Heartbreakers"" is more about these best friends breaking each others hearts than about abusing women.All performances are strong, but I was especially surprised by Nick Mancuso. He's generally a better actor than the films that he's in, but hey, we all gotta eat. Also, this was the last film made by Carol Wayne before her untimely death. She does a fine job in a rare dramatic role. Too bad she'll only be remembered as the ""Tea-Time Movie Lady"" on the Tonight show."
2,Didn't Catch my Attention,"I purchased this book for a biography book review that I was assigned a few years ago. When the book arrived, I tried to start reading it, but it just didn't catch my attention. I ended up putting it on my shelf and buying another biography. Granted, I don't usually care for biographies or non-fiction books, but I have found some that I like. This just wasn't one of them. It might have gotten better if I continued to read it, but I didn't wait around long enough to find out."
1,Disenchanted,"I heard this song on the radio this morning and it really annoyed the he11 out of me. ""Mesmerized"" is a weak attempt to come across as some type of funkadelic neo-soul. If you listen to the song closely, you can hear familiar melodies and phrases taken from old and new R&B songs. I heard the O'Jays, James Brown, and Beyonce all obviously patched together by force to make this hot mess called ""Mesmerized."" This song is a joke and I'm very disappointed in Faith for putting out this watered-down karaoke soul. Even Joss Stone wouldn't have sang anything *this* awful."
4,"""Bomber"" by Len Diegton","The anti-war novel, on which this CD is based, sets a very high standard of authorship. Alternate chapters describe the activities of the British Lancaster Bomber squadron on the one hand and the occupants of a small German village on the other. The CD, produced by the BBC, follows the novel faithfully but by a quirk of sound engineering, some of the conversations are hard to follow unless one uses headphones as I did. The CD collection is good entertainment nevertheless."
3,It was good...,"I did like this book.... I read it in two days. I liked the characters, but I think the whole plot was a bit drab. It was a good stroy of passion and romance and I am glad that I read it. I liked how both of their jobs conflicted in the story and their love prevailed. I think Brown should have kept going with the story, she could have made it better."
3,A quick read,"""Sweet Anger"" was a quick read. I failed to enjoy it as much as I've enjoyed some of her others. Why in the world would a woman fall for a man who tried to finger her dead husband? It seems to me that Kari Stewart was rebounding any way she knew how. This is not one of my favorites."
3,Easy Read but very predictable,This was a very good book. I love all of Sandra Brown's book but I thought this one was very predictable. Very similar to some of her others. I am excited that a new one is coming out.
4,Quick Fix,"This book is a good quick fix until the next book. I enjoyed the two main characters; however, the secondaries were just the right mix to keep the book interesting. This is the 30 mintue sitcom leading up to the hour drama."
4,A Keeper,This book is a smooth read with believable characters especially the leading man. A lighter version of Exclusive in terms of the storyline. Also a fast read
3,TALK ABOUT DRAMA,"I JUST FINISH READING THIS BOOK ON OCTUBER 25,2000.MY NAME IS MICHELLE RODAS FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.THIS WAS MY FIRST TIME READING ONE OF HER BOOKS.I WOULD BE INTERESTING READING MORE OF HER BOOKS BECAUSE HER EXPRESSIONS TOWARD THE TITLE WERE DETAILBY DETAIL.THERE WAS MOMMENTS OF SADNESS WHEN KARI'S HUSBAND DIED IN A CAR ACCIDENT.THE PART THAT I DIDN'T LIKE WAS WHEN HUNTER FALL IN LOVE WITH KARI QUICKLY, IT WASN'T REALISTIC. I DID LIKE THE SECONDARY COUPLE (BONNIE AND PINKIE) THERE ROMANCE WAS MORE REALISTIC.I DID ENJOYED THE BOOK BECAUSE IT WAS DRAMALISTIC."
3,Another Classy Sandra Brown Book,"I enjoyed this book and found that it was an easy read. I liked both the main and supporting characters. Not as ""exciting"" of a read as Charade & Fat Tuesday ... but a heartfelt romance none the less. If your a SB fan you will enjoy this!"
2,It didn't hang the moon...,"This one was just okay for me. I think what I didn't like about it was how mean the DA had to be in the beginning, and the unrealistic and completely unrelated line of questioning he took her through on the stand. Nothing he said had anything to do with the case against the two surviving men who were on trial. It was just ridiculous, and only succeeded in irritating me.And the other thing was the loss of her baby. Hunter was not broken up enough about that, and it was partially his fault if you ask me. Plus, how do you fall in love with someone you've never even met (as Hunter did with Kari). That stupidness just killed it for me.The best part of the story is when Kari is suspended and goes to the mountains, and Hunter followers her. The story is all good while they are in the mountains on a mini break, but then, I don't know, it was kind of flat from there. Nice enough read, I guess. I would recommend Eloquent Silence or Two Alone instead."
1,Terrible,I have read other books by Sandra Brown and enjoyed them but this one was terrible. I tried to read the whole thing but finally quit halfway through. Hunter who supposed to be a reputable DA molests Kari while she is unconcieous. Sometimes this thing reads like it was written by a 14 year old boy whose hormones are working overtime.
3,Does Anybody Proof Read?,"I read this book on my kindle and it was an ok story, but the mistakes in the printing sometimes made it hard to follow the story. The main character whose name was Kari was referred to as Kair, Karl, and Kan. Another mistake was using the word mom for room. There were other mistakes which I can't remember now, but were very distracting while reading."
2,Average,"Simple, single plot story. Overused romance phrases throughout. Story unoriginal and just average. Sandra Brown's more recent books are a lot better."
3,Basic romance,I liked this book. The introduction by the author notes that it is one of her first. It was a basic romance with two people who are against each other professionally but personally very attracted to each other. It is a basic romance but I enjoyed it.
1,Felt Deceived,I didn't realize that the Kindle release date could be so far from the original release date. This was deceptive and appeared to be a new release when the book was originally released in 1985? Story line was so out of date that I could only read the first two Chapters.
1,Sweet anger,"Very boring and predictable, not like the other Sandra Brown books. No story line, no suspense. Did not like the main characters."
2,Sometimes Sandra Brown is a gamble,Sometimes Sandra Brown has a pretty good story with fluff inbetween. With this story it was too much fluff/smut.I didn't get very far. Would not recomment it.
4,Sweet Anger,"Once again, Brown has done a fine job. Enjoyed almost all of the books she has written. Readers will enjoy this book as well."
3,sandra brown,Not her best effort although i have really enjoyed many of her books in the past. I would try another book by her
1,Boring!,"This is probably one of the most boring books I have ever had the stubborn desire to finish, thinking it had to have something that would cause a publisher to publish it. I did not find it. Most of the book is essentially pornography and pornography is boring unless you are an adolescent male I suppose.I think I will avoid any of her other writings and get back to someone with excellent writing, interest, humor, and fascinating characters, i.e., Edna Ferber, Kyle Mills, Nevada Barr, Sarah Paretsky, or Elizabeth George!"
4,"""So Unique! Chic. . .Chic""","Interesting collection of songs from two famous groups that dominated the dance disco era by producer Nile Rodgers, and many selections are to be had including one very difficult to find premiere disco song by Sister Sledge, ""Mama Never Told Me"" that I had originally on well known by inside disc jockeys vinyl album called DISCO-TREK. Some dance hits may be condensed since there are additional multi remixes of various songs which total close to thirty in all. In that case it would be wise to check out the highly rated album greatest hits by Chic, or other collections for Sister Sledge. Nice selection of dance cuts, but that very early song by Sister Sledge noted here is my biggest interest for this particular collection. By the way, ""Mama Never Told Me"" is not to be mistaken with Three Dog Night song with similar like title. Sister Sledge song refers to underlying qualities of the social ""quieter man"" and is full of shoo-du-waps!"
3,Routine but watchable police movie,"Robert Carradine plays Nick Berzak , a more than slightly demented L A cop whose violent tactics have garnered him the half -respectful ,half critical nickname ""Berserk "" He is partnered with an altogether more stable black cop played with typical style and polish by Billy Dee Williams .They are on the trail of a man suspected of being a major drugs dealer and have a somehat cavalier attitude toward the niceities of civil liberties and due process as they set about their task .The racially mixed partnership anticipates Lethal Weapon -this movie predates the Gibson vehicle by a year .It has some good action sequences and these compensate for a generally routine storylineJack Smight was once hailed as a promising director but his work here is routine like the script .Still watchable and worth renting if you like cop movies"
4,Great Quilting DVD,"This product is the TV series on DVD. There are different DVD sets for each season. The information is good. They cover all the way from beginner to advanced quilting projects. My only complaint is that they do tend to focus on gadgets a lot to complete their projects. I found, for myself, that while there were several quilts to drool over, there were few I'd actually feel confident taking on and making myself. But very inspirational..."
2,"Great if you're Black, Brown, Yellow, Red, or a combination","I found the funds available extremely limited for a 3.6 white female starting her freshman year in a state university...most funds were geared for minorities....even Bill Gates huge amount he's giving to 1000 students a year are only for minorities....if an 18 yr. old white girl is a mixture of 4-6 ethnic countries, will that count as a minority???? My grandaughter is holding down 2 summer jobs, getting a limited amount from the U of O,,, with no help from her parents at all...While i notice some scholarships for minorities are a full ride..Her sister is in a community college because she's having the same financial problem..White is not the color to be any more......"
3,Easy To Use,"I found this book very user-friendly. You can look up scholarships by state, county, company, major, GPA, religious affiliation, etc. The only problem I found was that most of them are so specific that I didn't qualify for very many. As a 22-yr. old white female, graduated valedictorian of my high school class, and maintain over a 3.0 right now, I guess I expected to find more than I did. And most of what I found, I had already found on some online searches. This book has so much information, so it will be different for each person."
2,"Great if you're Black, Brown, Yellow, Red, or a combination","I found the funds available extremely limited for a 3.6 white female starting her freshman year in a state university...most funds were geared for minorities......if an 18 yr. old white girl is a mixture of 4-6 ethnic countries, will that count as a minority????

3,National Geographic-Beyond The Movie-Alexander,"Although I did not watch Oliver Stone's Flop(what Stone or ""stoned"" movie does not flop?)I found myself fascinated by this(even Though Nat.Geo And History are not always Right when it comes to Some Histories),Overall However I don't know what To make Of the So-called ""Alexander The Great"" and what was so great?Yes He Conquered,was revered by Most People,The Romans,and even Made a Pharaoh and went as Far as Persia(Can't stand those Persians) And India,But I believe he like most in Pre-Jesus Christ Years Had such Egos thinking they were Gods much less Gods or King of Kings or Princes on Earth that most met unpleasant Downfalls anyway.(Of course a Counter Argument Can be made that the Pagans were Before Jesus,etcera and so fourth and the contributions made by the Greeks,etc.)An interesting Look at a Flawed Egotistical and Fruity(like most of the Era sadly,hence the end of such Immoral Civilizations)Leader,Good in Battle but nothing else."
5,Great Resource,"This was exactly what I needed. It gave me realistic expectations for how to get things rolling and on how to figure out the taxes in a business and how many clients are realistic for this type of business.Once I had this info, it gave me a better starting point to go from. I now think that I will be able to get my business up to part-time to full-time practice.I would recommend this book to healers and psychics as well. Since their work is closely linked to healing and will give you realistic expectation on how many clients you really can see in a week so you can reduce your chances of burn out."
4,Great help to honestly asses and plan,I am just starting a private practice and have found this book helpful in determining what I need to do along the way of starting and building my practice.
3,what planet is she on?,"I received this as a thoughtful gift when ending a mental health internship and while I tried many of the things in the book, my path to my ""ideal"" private practice did not even remotely approach her rosy outlook. Get on insurance panels if you want clients; this ideal client stuff is really for people who already have their names out there. Don't waste your money unless you want to exist in the same ether-world she lives in."
4,Twelve Months to Your Ideal Private Practice,This book is helpful for the emergent practioner. It encourages you to take all the necessary steps toward building a practice.
3,Nice looking naked women,"This video is obviously about naked women in interesting poses and it succeeds. I get a particular kick out of the fact that the women seem to disappear as the video goes on. Probably either got disgusted and quit at some point or just had somewhere else to go.. The nude women are attractive. The video is idiotic, but if you're looking for high production values in a vid entitled ""nude tai chi,"" you probably have a screw loose anyway. It's fun or exploitative or both depending on your proclivities."
2,"lots of ""talent"" but only enough to tease","Whenever a sample-happy metallic beat emerges we're in exciting new territory; unfortunately David Torn seldom lets a riff go on long enough to come close to satisfying. It's as if he wants to show off, to shock us a little, but is afraid we'll run away if he does an entire song in that mode. And then, over and over, we get these lengthy pseudo-flamenco maunderings that go absolutely nowhere no way nohow. And I personally hate it when an album has ONE vocal right in the middle. Torn would be much better off rocking the house with guest vocalists and leaving all that ""thoughtful"" dead air way behind. As it is, I couldn't get my head into this record one way or the other. It's too loud [occasionally] to be any kind of ambient, but the big beats fizzle out just when they've drawn you in. Why call yourself Splattercell if you're only going to sound like that 20% of the time?"
3,A 3. 5!,"I LOVE live efforts and interpretations. I also absolutely love D&K. I do however, love their studio work a bit more. If you are a gourmet of this genre, then you may consider auditioning a Tosca or Fila Brillia album. If, on the other hand, you are more the gourmand, (as I tend to be) or can't seem to live without the entire D&K catalog, then you will love the true live vibe even if the familiar tracks are performed in a formulaic manner by sterile yet talented studio types. I loved that this CD came with the bonus disc, yet three of the six tracks on the bonus disc are remixes of DROPHERE. The Dorfmeister & Hunter remix of Stiff Jazz, however, makes the bonus disc a true jewel."
1,Drivel - Beyond Belief,"My only excuse for having read this to the end is that I was stranded and had nothing else to read. It's silly, predictable and boring, with one-dimensional characters in a stereotypical setting. Beware! It is mind-numbing - there are plenty of good reads around, don't bother with this one."
1,Paperback Pulp,"What a farce! The vocabulary would barely challenge a sixth grader. The plot is painfully predictable. Weary idioms are everywhere-p.145...""I'll talk to Magee again and see just what's up his sleeve"". The intimate scenes are ridiculous-p.187...""His mouth was savaging hers"". Savaging?! Roberts certainly doesn't lack for words. Try p.315...""A storm hovered over the village, marching down from the northeast to camp on the border as an army digs in for a siege"". What?! And then there are gross lines like-p342...""the baby shot out, a slick bullet, into his hands, and already wailing"". But the worst is the profanity. When is someone going to 'blow the whistle' on all the profanity? It's totally unnecessary, not politically correct and, in this case, an insult to the Irish...."
4,The Conclusion to the Series,"Nora Roberts loves Ireland, and her love of the country is clearly stated throughout this book. She portrays the people as warm and friendly and the land as green and beautiful. Darcy Gallagher and her brothers own Gallagher's pub. The Gallaghers recently started an undertaking that involves building a theatre onto the pub. The man responsible for the theatre is Trevor Magee. Trevor and Darcy are immediately attracted to one another, and that passion blooms into romance. Prince Carrick of the faeries knows that Trevor and Darcy are the last key to breaking the curse that keeps him from his own true love, Lady Gwen. All that remains is for Trevor and Darcy to realize the extent of their passion for each other. Neither one of them is ready to commit. Roberts tells a beautiful story. Her characters are real and her descriptions are vivid. This is one of her best trilogies."
5,"Heart of the Sea, by Nora Roberts","I would give this book ten stars if that were a choice. Nora brings the landscape and history to life as well as a little magic to spice up the life of her characters. By the time I finished this book I felt as though these characters were real.The picture Nora Roberts paints for the minds eye becomes so vivid you feel as though you are there. You can smell the flowers and the rain.Great trilogy. Jewel of the Sun, Tears of the Moon, and Heart of the Sea. A must buy. NOW!"
4,Left me wanting more!,"Jewels of the Sun was my favorite one of this trilogy, but Heart of the Sea was very good. I want Nora Roberts to write more books about the Gallagers now! Forget falling in love (yes, I know she's a romance writer), I want to know all about the couples' children and Darcy's singing career . . . there's a lot of future book material here.Also, in defense of Darcy: I like her. She's not money-grubbing, she's a woman who knows what she wants and how to get it! One of the best things about this trilogy is that all three women are strong, independent characters. If Darcy is ruthless, it's because she's been treated ruthlessly and that's what she knows. How many men ask her out because of her wit and intelligence, do you think? None! It makes perfect sense that she would look at external factors first, since that's how men look at her."
2,"Disappointing To Say The Least.... (Sorry, Mrs R.)","The first two books in this series were absolutely fantastic, but this one was boring, and didn't show Darcy in a very good light. Darcy was pretentious, superficial, and was obsessed with greed; fine clothes, nice house, that sort of thing, which had to be the best. She completely overshadowed Trevor, who should have shined here. There's no one better than Nora Roberts, this one just didn't measure up."
5,the best yet,"this book is by far the best of all three. it tied in all of the loose ends of the first and second books, and it was a good ending for carrick and lady gwen. nora roberts is an inspiring author... although this may be considered a trashy romance by some, it captures all the magic and myth of ireland. i credit her for sparking my interest in ireland. i have fallen in love with the country, and i believe her books have made me all the more interested in the legends and myths and fairy tales of this magical place, where ghosts and faeries are something to be believed in and relied upon. i thank her for that.roberts has a solid, well-written story all through the trilogy. she also has a talent for capturing feelings and translating them into words that few people have. i am thoroughly pleased by the outcome of the three books."
3,Okay!,"I really enjoyed the first two books of this trilogy, but this one not so much because I found darcy's character really annoying! I liked the second book of this trilogy the best because of the characters, but i just hated darcy! i know she was just a character and all but she was just too irritating to me. but this is still a good book so im happy to give it three stars."
2,Dissapointing Conclusion,"I loved the first two books in this series, Jewels of the Sun, and Tears of the Moon, but it was so hard to get through this book. I found it to be very slow moving and painful, and only continued to read as I wanted to see how the trilogy ended. I don't want to give away the ending, but even if you enjoyed the first two books, you may want to think twice about reading this one."
3,Heart of the Sea,"Irish Trilogy - Book 3The conclusion brings Darcy to the forefront. She is restless working and singing the family pub. She longs for an exciting better life and wants the finer things for herself. Darcy comes off as shallow and materialistic.Trevor Magee is a businessman searching for his Irish roots while building the new theater, and too much of the story was spent on the construction. He is an arrogant flashy, and doesn't mind flaunting it.These two have to be together for the story to conclude, and for the spirits to be at rest."
3,A bit disappointing...,"I loved the first two books in this series. They are among my favorite NR books. I'm sorry to say that I was a bit disappointed in this book. The character of Darcy had so much potential in the first two books and I was really looking forward to her story. Unfortunately, I didn't see much of the warmth and depth of her personality that seemed was coming from the other stories. She was more shallow, not as lovable as before. Not a bad character, but not what I was hoping for. As for Trevor, another okay character, but not one I could love. I'm not completely sure why the book didn't do it for me, as it seems many people loved it. I liked it in that it rounded out and finished the story, both for Darcy and for the other main characters. It also gave us the resolution to the fairy part of the story. For these reasons, it's on my keeper shelf, but I was really hoping for a little more punch."
4,a pleasant read,"Heart of the Sea is the third of the Ardmore Gallaghers series by Nora Roberts. Darcy Gallagher is in charge of service at Gallagher's Pub in Ardmore, but has ambitions to marry a rich man and see the world. When wealthy businessman Trevor Magee arrives from New York to oversee the building of a theatre attached to Gallagher's Pub, he is immediately attracted to the feisty Darcy. And she to him, before she knows anything about his wealth. When he hears her sing, he wants to sign her for a record contract. This last instalment of the Ardmore Gallaghers trilogy is a bit slow to get going, but eventually the pace picks up. Fans of the series will be pleased to encounter the characters from the first two books: Aidan and Jude, Shawn and Brenna. In this particular instalment, the romantic situation echoes the mythological tale nicely, bringing both to their ultimate resolution. The birth scene is delightful. A pleasant read."
5,Absolutely Absorbing!!,Heart of the Sea was awesome!! I couldn't put it down. Nora Roberts combines the present with the slightest bit of the past. She introduces you to the Irish culture and and their belief in magic. You find yourself yelling at the characters- stop being so stubborn! This book hooked me on her others as well. For another great one try the Stanislaski Sisters- it's much much better than the back of the book leads on.
3,Not the best,"Heart of the Sea, the third installment of this ""enthralling"" Irish trilogy had to be the weakest of the lot. Now, I am all for hunky, rich men sweeping into town and picking romance with the locals, and Darcy was a likable character, IMO, but something just lacked. Not even a full page was given to the (much more likable) Carrick and Gwen, whose whoel legend set the stones for this tale. Now, you should read this book, I just dont think it is some of Nora's best work. Anyone else think this whole trilogy was weak compared to her other great books like the Dream trilogy or Honest Illusions?"
4,"Great, But not her best.","This book was as fantastic as the first two. I loved how each character developed into who they wanted to be. the Hero in this book sipmly shines. I love Trevor Magee. He is a wonderful addition to Ms Roberts Heroes. and as much as I loved Trevor, I hated Darcy ten times more. She is a selfish, greedy and arrogant woman. she hides her true self from Trevor but still wants him to understand that she's in love w/ him. The Book was wonderful. But if your annoyed by greey main characters... STAY AWAY!!!!"
4,Good Ending,"It is always a please to pick up a Nora Roberts and rediscover why she is an excellent author of romantic fiction. HEART OF THE SEA has all of the uusual elements, beautiful people, facinating occupations, story desires, and personal conflict to keep the lovers apart for 369 pages. A great book to take to the beach.Nash Black, author of Writing as a Small Business and Haints."
5,A magical ending for a wonderful new trilogy!,"Darcy Gallagher knows exactly what she wants. A rich man who will love and adore her, and shower her with all the baubles she could ever wish for. And when that wish comes true she finds she was wrong -- she wants something more. A man who can love her as much as she loves him. Could that man be Trevor Magee?A heart-warming conclusion to Nora Roberts Irish trilogy!"
4,Perhaps the best of this Irish trilogy,"The first two installments of the Irish ""jewels"" series were adequate reads but nothing that made me race out to buy the final book (unlike the ""Born in..."" series - which was terrific). I finally read Heart of the Sea last night and enjoyed this light read immensely.What makes this book work? For starters, while some of the other reviewers didn't care for it, I rather like the unabashed ambition of Darcy and Trevor. Materialism isn't always a good thing but at least these two are honest about it and hence their characters have some motivation. I also felt some genuine romantic tension between the two.I also felt that the Garrick and Gwen sub-plot actually worked in this book, whereas it had only annoyed me in the first two books.Bottom-line: Not great literature but a solid, predictible read. Enjoy the Irish atmosphere and six likeable main characters and don't worry too much about how things will turn out."
4,Trilogy Ends!?,"I was so excited to find this book on the store shelf. The characters were all there to continue with the exciting story of the Gallager family and the legends of their past. The cumulative story line was great until the last page, and my honest thought was that the story could continue past the trilogy. It just did not seem to covered the ""happy-ever-after"" to a fulfilling conclusion.Definite read for someone following the trilogy, but expect to want to read more at the end."
4,"Good Book, but. . .","Heart of the Sea, is, don't get me wrong a good book, and be quite enjoyable. But it lacks the charm the first two in the trilogy had. I feel like I enjoyed Darcy, the main female character in this one, better in the other two. I'd defiantly read it if you hadn't, but it isn't one I've re-read like I did with the other two. So all in all, it's an enjoyable book, and is worth the time to read, and even to buy."
3,Typical,"Typical nora Roberts twaddle. He books are kind of like a train wreck, you can't look away, even though you know exactly what is going to happen. At least she throws in a bit of Magick."
2,Not One of My Favorites,"You don't need me to tell the you the story in this, the third of her stories about the life and loves the Gallagher siblings. That has been done very well by the other reviewers. I just want to add to the reviews by saying that, as a Nora Roberts fan, this one was one of my least favorites. The first book of this trilogy captured my imagination with the use of the ghosts and legend and their impact on the main charaters' lives, but with each of the successive books, the story got weaker and weaker. I can't get a handle on my dismay with this book, but suffice it to say that when I finished, all I could say was to my friends and fellow romance readers, ""Oh well -- whatever."" Not my usual, ""you've gotta buy this one!"" Trust me, you can wait to borrow it from a friend."
5,Nora Roberts is the best!,Makes you feel like you're really in Ireland! Am a big fan of her books. Read everything she writes. Beautiful!
4,Heart of The Sea,The main characters personalities were definetaly a little different than most. This kept the story line from becoming to redundant.
3,Good hypnosis CD's,"This is an excellent product for the beginner in hypnosis. If you haven't had any previous experience or education with hypnosis, I would highly recommend this. I, however, did not actually want all the education. I just wanted the hypnosis CD's, which are actually very good. You can even use this information to make your own personal recording."
5,Well Done...,"This Self Hypnosis Home Study Course is very concise and well organized. It provides understanding and develops expertise, which can also be applied in Hypnosis with others.This is a Good no-nonsense product, and I highly recommend it.Thank You for reading.Gary Haun"
3,Just doin' it for the carnies,"This is a competition style video. If you're looking for an actual circus video you'd probably be disappointed. But if you're a performer or close follower of circus acts you will definitely appreciate the skill and variety showcased here. There are some very unique acts on the DVD you won't see just anywhere. I subtracted big points for the absolutely dreadful Olympic style commentary that is overlayed on the video. No juggler has ever referred to his craft as ""jugglery"". If you can get past that, it's a cool video. One that I enjoy having in my collection."
2,"DVD circus, for clowns","A circus is more than watching talented, practised people performing tricks. It is an atmosphere thing. I personally love circusses, having seen some of the great circus acts in Russia, but the point of this DVD escapes me.You don't get the same atmosphere as seeing these acts in real life. Maybe on an IMAX screen, but sitting in front of a TV screen watching this is plain dull."
2,"Over priced, heavy, noisy, and slow","I bough these clippers wanting a very good set of cordless clippers. I thought that is what I would get because of the price. I use them on horses. I have a old set of $60 clippers and wanted to get something better. These oster clippers are slow, vibrate, and make noise which isn't good for horses plus they don't cut good in heavy leg hair. They keep stalling. My old clippers that are worn out do a better job. Don't buy these expecting to have a professional set of clippers. They are over priced by a factor of 3."
1,A waste!,"The only thing this might be useful for is to boost the self-esteem of a child who questions their intelligence. It certainly can not be accurate. Granted, my children are both gifted. We paid a psychologist for a true IQ test to have them placed into gifted programs, but this booklet was WAY too easy for them. I do not trust the results as useful for anyone. I thought the ""Easy-Scoring"" was supposed to be an easy way to identify whether to pursue a real IQ test -- not that ANYONE could score in the genius range."
3,All about the famous photographer.,"This biography is interesting, if a little bit tedious reading. Margaret Bourke-White was a professional long before women were common in her profession."
5,Great Value on Super Binoculars!,"I did extensive research before I purchased a Canon 7x42A binocular. I checked out all the top brands, including Leitz and Steiner, but settled on the Canon due to it's very bright image (via a large exit pupil) and it's reputation for excellent optics.I was not disappointed by the Canon's performance. Images are tack sharp, with great brightness and good contrast. Sure, you can get equal performance from the aforementioned ""big-name"" brands, but you'd have to spend hundreds more. For the money, this binocular simply cannot be beat."
1,Not good,I bought this item thinking that it will be a good one for a good price. Head makes a lot of sound and dvd stucks a lot during. I have returned this item.
2,Not the best,"This player started making loud motor noises half way into every movie from the first one we tried. The swivel screen is nice, but in a car bag would not stay upright very well. We returned it."
1,"Poor tech support. Very short battery life, Faulty circuits,","I bought this one from amazon and in last 12 months hardly used for 5-7 times. Waste of money. After a gap of three months after last use, when I tried to play a DVD, it didn't work. I called the tech support and without any troubleshooting told me to buy a new one.Better pay some more money and buy one from Sony or Phillips."
2,Big screen but lot of noise,The screen is big.. picture quality is good but there is lot of noise when playing the cd. If the CD has scratches it wont play. I am not happy about this product as the noise irritates me.
4,great for the price,"We bought this for traveling with our 2 yr old son. It is great b/c it comes with a case to hang on the headrest HOWEVER to change the disc you have to take it out of the case, etc. Battery power isn't long but the cord to connect to lighter is so no problem in the car! great clarity and sound."
4,Fills my need.,"I had bought the 3 season set of the show ""Deadwood"", and needed some way to play it without upsetting the rest of the family. The language in this show is really really bad. Sitting in the basement and watching it is uncomfortable so I bought this Coby player after reading some of the reviews on here. I find the audio and video to be as well as expected and don't have a single complaint; however, I use this sitting on my sofa and not in a vehicle, so I can't speak to the method most people use a portable dvd player. I also have played only pre-recorded dvd's and cant speak to home made copies. If I had to come up with a complaint for balance, it would be that the headsets provided (2) hurt my ears. Overall I finds this excellent value."
2,Not pleased,The video quality is excellant. Battery life so poor that we were unable to view a complete 93 minute DVD. Audio quality is very poor. With low volume and difficult to listen to and understand all speech. We are waiting for return authorization to send it back
3,Not bad,Not a bad player for the money. Comes with tons of accessories. It is just very noisy. The drive makes a constant whining noise that can only be muted by turning up the volume. Not a good thing when in the company of easily-annoyed others.
5,Life Saver!,"After a severe injury left me in a rehab center far from all of my family and friends, this DVD player was a true life saver. The picture and sound are excellent, and it is easy to use. I added a set of earphones, and I could watch a movie without disturbing the others in my room on those long, sleepless nights. I love that you don't have to have the remote to acess the different features."
5,The Tenant's soundtract is hypnotic and tragic.,"Great CD!!! If you love Roman Polanski's The Tenant, then this CD is for you. The sound of the The Tenant is simultaneosly hypnotic and tragic. I love listening to it over and over. Maybe because I love to watch the film over and over.This soundtrack is very hard to find. I think your only best chance of owning it is through Amazon.com. I highly recommend this soundtrack to people who love Tess or The Tenant."
5,Brilliant Underappreciated Composer,"Finally, music from two of Polanski's finest films by the brilliant and under-appreciated composer Phillipe Sarde (""Quest for Fire"", ""The Bear"")is available for the collector. The music from ""Tess"" is deeply romantic and filled with melancholy. It seems almost futile to attempt to descibe it. The haunting score from ""The Tenant"" is vexing with mystery and subtle horror. The use of Ben Franklin's ""glass organ"" (or is it ""harmonica""?)will send shivers up your spine! This disc is a must for Polanski and Sarde fans. I only wish they would release remastered versions of the films on DVD."
3,Time and Again: Time Was/ Times Change,Not one of her best efforts. I found myself skipping around to find out what happens. It seemed more like one of her first works redone. I prefer her new books but if you like her old style then this was not bad.
3,Time Stood Too Still,"I am an avid Nora fan and I love everything she writes. Some stories are exceptional; others good, but always entertaining. Time and Again was entertaining to a point. Stories of Caleb and Jacob Hornblower crashing down to the 20th century from the 23rd century and each meeting up with the Stone sisters - Liberty and Sunbeam. The first story concentrates on Libby & Caleb and the second story is a carbon copy of the first with the other two siblings. My main objection was the repetitive storylines and the fact that in the first story, there seemed to be more sex than story. It was an okay read but certainly not up the to the high standards and excellent writing that I know Nora is more than capable of providing even the most critical reader. I finished the book, but definitely would not pass it on as a ""must"" read."
3,The one not broken during shipping works great!,"Rome's #4100 Super Duty Wiener Fork, Chrome Plated SteelOrdered two of these for the kids to roast marshmallows in the fireplace. These were shipped separately. One was received in great condition. The kids had a blast roasting their marshmallows. The second fork had the prongs broken off the stem when it was received. Went through Amazon website. Replacement was shipped very quickly. When the package was received the fork was bent so that the stem is rounded. Have not had a chance to resolve yet with the holidays etc."
3,shipping was my reasoning,"I have a hard time understanding why shipping was so much more than the price of the items..... AND then it took so long to arrive. The item has yet to be used since we have not yet gone camping. I am sure it is fine. BUT-- this was supposed to be a birthday gift. It arrived on the last day they said it could possibly get here. It took such a long time. For the fact that I paid so much to ship it, they should have sent it sooner. Period. I wouldn't buy from them again unless they fixed this."
3,Packaging is ridiculous,"I love the forks. But they were packaged individually (for 5 forks) in boxes that were stacked as high as my front door and as long as my porch (think 5 feet long and about 15 inches high and wide per box) If I had known that, I would not have ordered them. The waste was obscene. please rethink your packaging of this item Amazon!"
1,weiner sticks,The order included 6 individual weiner sticks. I was not very happy with the way they were packaged. They were packaged in six individual boxes with a lot of packing material in each one. each box was big enough to contain at least 20 weiner sticks. I can't believe Amazon made any profit on this transaction and it took me a annoying long time to break the boxes down for trash pickup.
4,Will work okay,"They were smaller than I was expecting, but will still be fine. The construction was also lighter than I expected, but for the price, still a winner."
5,Packing was grossly obscene!!!,"I read the reviews about the packaging of these forks and couldn't imagine that it could be as bad as people said. WELL IT WAS WORSE!!!What in the world can the people in charge of shipping be possibly drinking, smoking or popping??? The waste involved here was disgusting. AMAZON PLEASE WAKE-UP & CORRECT THIS PROBLEM! Each fork arrived in a seperate box with huge amounts of brown paper. The boxes measured 40 X 17 X 12 in. As stated in another post, enough space for at least 20 forks or more. I am not a ""tree-hugger"" but I am concerned about the stewardship & care of earth for future generations. I think we should all do our part of re-use, reduce & recycle. Amazon what is your excuse ????????????"
2,It came broken,This item came broken so I returned it. I got charged on my account and I have not seen a credit yet.If it would have been packaged better it might not have broken. I can't really say how I would have like the product because I never used it.
5,Great idea if you had multipule kids,"I bought this because of one of the reviews I read. I have 2 boys aged 3 and 1. As soon as the 1 year old started to crawl we had trouble with all toys the eldest was playing with, but especially the train tracks. The baby would try to pick the tracks up thinking he was playing too. This caused some tears. Now with the suretrack the baby can come along and try to pick up the track, instead of pulling the track peices apart from eachother, the entire track picks up. No more having to put the track back together! Also when just playing, the tracks no longer split apart. The best, we can pick up the entire track and move it to another location when needed without it falling apart!"
3,not what i thought it would be,"I purchased this for my husband, I thought that he could clap once from a few feet away and it would work. He has to clap more than once usually and he needs to be close to it. he might as well just turn the light off by hand."
4,stretch over time,"My son was given a Melissa and Doug wooden train set as an early 2 year birthday present. I research everything before I purchase so I knew these were a must. Initially, I LOVED these and couldn't imagine life without them. We now have a mix of train tracks - Thomas,Plan, & M&D. We have reconfigured the tracks several times to accomodate new Thomas accessories and a new train table. Recently I've noticed that the Suretracks slide around quite a bit - it doesn't matter the brand of tracks. Still - I plan to order a 4th set to secure the entire track layout."
4,Saved my sanity!,A pain to put on and looks ugly but it absolutely works!!! My 2 year old can no longer take the tracks apart or knock it over. Would highly recommend to those with small children who are constantly taking apart your tracks. I have the Plan City tracks and fit perfect.
5,Great find!,These were the perfect solution when a two year old wants to really play with the trains on the track and a 1 year old wants to pull the tracks apart. They are easy to put on and can be removed when the children get older and want to design the track configurations themselves.
5,must have item,"I hate to build train bridges because even with their support, they don't stay well.With this, suretrack, it is so fun to build track because all the bridges stay sooooo well.A Must have item if you have a train set.I love them!Hope they will last long."
4,Important math concepts offered in story form,"This book offers a range of middle-school math concepts, explained in story format. The story is age-appropriate, and although it's rather lame and strains in places to be funny (the giant talking animals are a bit much) it is actually fairly effective.Almost the second half of the book is devoted to elementary school math as a review section, and I appreciated that they put that later in the book than the harder stuff: a student who is not doing so well in math is not going to be greatly cheered by a book that starts with ""2+2=4 and why"". By putting the review at the end, it can be read and digested at the student's own pace, instead of the pace of the book.I am using the book for a slightly younger student who is struggling with math, and he is having fun with the scenarios that the story offers. However, I am guiding him through the problems and explanations: grades 6-8 is probably right on target for a student working independently."
2,Apple Melon,"I was super pumped that it is low carb, but the flavor isn't all that great. I much prefer the dutch chocolate flavor."
5,Perfect,Just what I wanted and it is the best protein out there I feel. I will be ordering more that is for sure!!
3,"Good value, horrible taste","Generally I use ON Gold standard/Performance Whey and I wanted to give this a try. Worst decision ever.The alpine punch's taste is completely disgusting. I hate it. I've only taken about a half lb down so far and I can't stomach the taste anymore. I usually go with the Chocolate Malt/Chocolate with ON and they're delicious. With this, I have to either chug it in a second or sip on it very slowly.Good product, horrible flavors and very chalky."
4,Tasty.... No bad aftertaste,"Has a light fruity flavor, although a little creamy. Not bad tasting and like that it's fruity. Many protein drinks have a distinct aftertaste to them. This one doesn't seem to. I don't mind drinking it each day.Dissolves pretty easily after about 15-20 seconds of shaking."
3,Very watery,"I love the chocolate version of this shake; and the nutritional aspects of Isopure for my low carb life. But the vanilla has, to me, a faint pineapple taste, and is so watery it doesn't fill me up AT ALL. Won't buy this flavor again."
4,Best so far,"Tried many different proteins but this one came recommended by my meat-head brother lol. tried it and gotta say, it mixes extremely well and doesnt taste nasty. haven't tried with water though. I use hood calorie countdown to mix with because of the low carbs and it tastes like drinking a chocolate shake. definitely recommended!"
5,Wonderful Product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Lactose Free!!!!,"To make it short, I am lactose intolerant and I've had a hard time finding a good lactose free protein shake on the market. I am so glad I found this product.I am currently in a fat loss mode, going to the gym 5 days a week doing circuit training with interval cardio. I drink 1.5 to 2 scoops mixed with water post work out and it has done wonders for me. I have shed fat and maintained muscle mass. Great taste, lactose free, low carb and mixes easily, seems like a winning formula to me."
1,this is not what it shows,"First of all, sorry for any english mistakes. It's not my native language.I've ordered ""Labrada Nutrition Carb Watchers Lean Body Hi-Protein Meal Replacement Shake, Vanilla Ice Cream, 2.29-Ounce Packets (Pack of 42)"" and the picture shows a BOX that it's supposed to have those packs. When the package arrived I got disappointed since they sent me a TUBE. It's very frustrating when you buy something and you receive a different product.ISOPURE is great, though. The product information is wrong, including the picture. If you want to buy a TUBE, go ahead."
2,Pretty in color...poor in taste,"The service was good but the product lacks in flavor. I loved the Pineapple, Orange & Banana. The Strawberries & Cream sounds good but really is pretty blah."
1,Terrible Taste,I'm having a hard time even finishing off this tub of powder. I'm not new to ISOPURE products but this flavor is not the best. Avoid this flavor at all costs.
2,Not good value for money,"This would be a good product if it were not overpriced. Zero carb, while true, is hype; that's how they get away with such high price. Got fooled myself."
3,Great Price for the Product...however...,"The box that the item was dilivered did not look like it was ""banged up"" in any way. The plastic band holding the lid on top of the container was in tact. However, the inner seal to the container was not 100% sealed. This suggests that the item was knocked around with enough force that this seal was damaged."
1,Strawberry is NASTY!!!,"I've had this protein for about 4-5 months and i still haven't finished it. Got the strawberry flavor and it's pretty dam nasty. So hard to drink, feel like throwing it back up. Don't know about the other flavors but definatly avoid Strawberry flavor. Wish i could get an exchange for better flavor and tell if this stuff works or not. But in this real world that's impossible."
2,Taste is awful,"I switched to this product after using another protein for a while, hoping that it would arrive faster than the other one did. It did arrive quickly, but the product itself doesn't taste very good. I like Metabolic Drive better for a low carb option. Less calories, more filling and better tasting!"
3,Flavor is Not Ok,"I usually drink Isopure shakes and wanted to try a new flavor. Mango seemed good, yuck, its terrible to me!Shipping and the entire purchase was fine no issues there, more issues with the flavor and product."
4,Label Says 3 Carbs,"I ordered this because I am on a very low carb diet plan. Although the name says low carb, the product description says zero carb. The nutrition label actually says 3g of carbs per serving. It is a small amount, but it matters for a low carb plan. Aside from that, I like it. The taste is good. I mixed it in a blender and it was very frothy. It is any easy way to get a lot of protein. I would definitely recommend it to others, just be aware that it does have 3g of carbs. I wish Amazon would post nutrition labels for all food products."
5,excellent protein source,"This protein is very delicious, especially if you are tierd of the typical vanilla, chocolate, strawberry most brands offer. Mixes very well, and has no carbs. Excellent for a low carb diet."
5,Excellent Product,"I have been lifting for about three years now and so far this is the only protein that works for me. It is incredibly easy to mix and does not leave you with that bloated feeling. Best of all it has zero sugar and zero carbs which helps if you, like me, are in the cutting stage. Along with that, it has an amazing taste. It has no lactose so it does not leave that protein aftertaste that most other products do. I recommend this product for anyone wanting to get lean and for anyone that is lactose intolerant."
3,it's ok,its ok thing of this product is the taste it taste really salty even though its zero carbs its taste is bad . If your trying to lose fat and gain muscle yeah i would say buy it . But if not buy the regular kind with more carbs and better taste
1,SUCRALOSE!,"Basic nutritional information was posted, but ingredients were not. Disgusted when product arrived and I found that it contained sucralose, artificial dyes and all kinds of other chemical garbage. Amazon won't allow returns on this huge, unopened item. Buyer beware!!"
2,HORRIBLE TASTE,I can tolerate bad taste when it comes to protein shakes...but this pineapple orange banana is HORRIBLE. I have had the mint chocolate chip in the Isopure and it was way better than this. The guy that works in my local nutrition center agrees with me and said the chocolate is the best flavor in this brand.Thats what I am trying next...if I can finish the pineapple orange banana!
3,isopure,was hoping for a better taste and easier mixing. Very hard to get this without chunks. I think I will invest in the mixer as well to see if it helps
3,Great Source of Protein,"My Doctor recommended this as part of a weight lose, exercise, and weight lift program. It available at many health food and vitamin stores. But I could not find any better prices than here. Some of the flavors are a bit powdery but the Pinapple/Orange/Banana is one of the best. It has 25 grams of protein pure suggested serving. That was a bit too much for me to consume at one time, so I instead of drinking one shake, I drank two a different times of the day. The makers of the product does not recommended this for weight loss so if you decide to take it as part of your regime, please check with your doctor."
5,Isopure,I had Gastric Sleeve 8 oct. 2011 and need a protien supplment. I tryed different types That were recommended by my surgeon. Isopure Was the one that tasted best to me. I really like the Duch Chocolate. When I find I am low on protien for the day Isopure is the one for me!
4,"Great taste, easy on stomach.",Finally a great tasting protein shake. I got the banana cream and it's very yummy indeed. I use a shaker and it comes out perfect. It is very easy on my stomach unlike some of the other protein shakes out there. This has no lactose and gives me great energy. I'll def. be refilling my supply with the same brand next time.I also tried 100% Whey Gold chocolate and the IsoPure is easier on my stomach and tastes better.
5,Best out there,"I purchased this because the other reviews were so good. Of the many other proteins out there, this one dissolves well and does not separate if left out for a few minutes. Taste is good and can blend with any juice if you like."
3,Easy mixing...bad after-taste,"The title says it all. I purchased the Pineapple Orange Banana and was surprised at how easily it mixed. The smell reminded me of that orange anti-biotic I took as a child (which I linked because of its sweetness) and while the initial taste was similar, the after taste was potent; not matatlic or gritty, just not in harmony with the inital taste. I was able to drink it but I am worried about getting through the remaining three pounds of it. As for the consistency, it was smooth and only slightly thicker than water...almost like an after work-out drink. Definitely not thick and gloopy like some of the other mixes on the market."
1,Sour Milk Smell,"The product has a distinct spoiled milk smell. You can smell it right after opening the lid, and that smell lingers after you mix it. I'm only mixing with water. Nasty. Threw it in the garbage."
1,Taste?,"First let me say that the response time in shipping, and getting this product to me was fabulous. It was the product itself that rated so low. The taste was non-descript - it was vanilla, but not sweet, yet sweet, all at the same time. I would not recommend this product based solely on this..."
5,Great product,Most protein least fat of any supplementI actually use 1 scoop instead of 2 cause I only want a 25 g protein intake. Im not doing competition So that's perfect for me and lasts longer. It's also light formula. I mix with banana skim milk peanu butter and ice. Taste amazing
2,Served its purpose but I had to force it down,"I seriously wanted to love this product. I mean it's low-carb AND chocolate! What could go wrong? Well, lots. I have a morning routine in which it is imperative that I get to take my AM supplements with my shake. It's how I remember to take them in the first place. Well, I can't take any supplement with this or I feel like I'll wretch. I literally had to choke this down every morning. I would say buy at your own risk or if you happen to LOVE this product. FYI: Other Isopure products are awesome so it's still a go-to brand for me.Lastly, the amazon price for this is pretty much theft. Look elsewhere for the product IF you're still interested and you'll find a much more reasonable rate practically anywhere.Overall rating: 1/4Taste: 2/4Consistency: 0/4Value: 1/4"
5,Great product!,I have been using this brand of protein powder for a year now. This new flavor is very good. It is my new favorite. It mixes well with just water in a shaker bottle. Keep up the great work!Strength Training and Sports Nutrition for Women
3,ok,"this flavor is not the best. When you mix it with water it turns orange-yellow, The color is too strong for me. It is much higher in sodium than other products"
5,"Mixes Fast, Good Price","Can't say much about protein other than ""does it mix well"" and ""is it priced well?"" In this case, yes to both. :)"
