2,"""For women, By women""","Lots of talk, loads of searching everyone's motives. Tiresome. Make sure the fast forward is working on your DVD player. The charm of earlier Heroes episodes was the introduction of characters by their actions, which showed vulnerability, power, delight, you name it. Season 4 rarely shows these things, it just tells. A major disappointment and not a surprise that the series tanked and was cancelled after this. A real shame, but Tim Kring is to blame for trying to be deep but ironically providing a shallow version of visual art. Show it, dude, show it. The writers are listed as men, but this series is all about conversation, broken up by hugs and glances. Best description: ""For women, by women."""
1,Heroes season 4,Package came all busted up and dvd's are scratched and freeze up.Also the gay agenda just keeps pushing on and ruining family values. To the writers I say way to reck the series!
3,A decent end,the series started off as promising but as of the 2nd season it truly wavered and went down hill. the 4th season ended at a cliffhanger so sadly we will never know how the charecters truly ended up.
3,Angel Nacianceno,"Heroes over all is a great show especially season 1. Season 4 was the down fall of the show witch lead to cancellation. As a fan id love see Peter regain all his powers, not his one power at a time crap. Season 4 made manny twists, and ended the show with alot of questions unanswered."
1,Don't waste your time...,"There is really no point in starting Heroes.NBC discontinued it this 4th season. We are left with several major story lines that just hang.The major story line, Sylar the mass-murdering psychopathic nearly omnipotent character, is destined to be killed by a coalition of heroes.This never happens. You are left with Sylar trying to regain his power after a near death experience.Unfortunately for anyone who cared NBC gave a big Eff-EwE to the people who actually did watch it to make room forshows that are watched less or on their way to being cancelled. I love their logic.So, if you're in it for the story, its not worth a watch..., just a waste of time."
2,Worst Season & Cancellation Deserved.,"I enjoyed the series as a whole and very much recommend the first 3 seasons, BUT, season 4 is a pretty big let down. It never feels right, the actors don't seem as ""into it"", and the whole carnival thing just didn't work for me. Sylar's spontaneous ""conversion"" never feels right either. And of course no series is complete these days without some major character coming out of the closet. Hollywood really needs to stop being so over the top in that regard. Lots more nit picks but there are a couple funny moments. Too bad they are more rare than not. The bottom line is that the series was canceled, and season 4 is the reason."
5,My collection is complete.,"Heroes was a good show, but then again all good descent shows don't really last that long. I have watched the seasons and love rerun DVD watching."
2,Worst of the seasons...,I only purchased the product to complete my Heroes collection. The 1st season was by far the best and the progressively got worse. This is the final season and the only reason anyone should buy it is if it is less than $10.
1,NEVER RECEIVED item or any refund,after many attempts to contact this personage we still NEVER received our CD or any refund . I hope no one else makes the same mistake .
3,Ridiculous,It just gets ridiculous at this point. They should have stopped at Vilans. I think someone just didn't want to give it up. It was alright and I finished it just because I started it. Bu it took me forever to finish watching it. And it ended sucky also. Not as thrilling as the first three.
1,Really disappointing season,"I loved Heroes. The first season was great, then it just went downhill from there... this one was incredibly boring. They obviously didn't know what to do with some characters so added some totally pointless stories in order to keep them in the show... Most plots didn't fit together at all, like they did in the other seasons. Very disappointing.IMO they should have stopped at season 3, I'm not surprised the series was canceled after this."
3,Heroes slows a more with each season,"I like this show. The first season was as exciting as a TV show can get. And this season has had it's moments. But could never reach the first season in terms of fun, adventure, and suspense. At lets face it. Sylar is what made this show. When he is not the main bad guy the show doesn't work well. I liked the new characters and the effects are impressive like all the seasons. But here is where I was frustrated with the show. Rarely have all the main characters worked together as a team against a common foe. That is excusable for the first season but to have the forth season end the way that it did is a let down.It's enjoyable to watch. Exp. if you like Sci Fi and fantasy. But I just felt this show could be so much more. It's my opinion that the reason shows go south is because the marketers pander to females too much. And that always makes shows... well... suck.Thanks for reading."
1,What a deception,The series is great but after hours of watching you discover that there is no end in the series is a deception!!! This should be noticed somewhere in the series description/summary.
4,huge fan,"very impressed with this product. Quality was good, cover was still intact, i always use this company and have never been disatisfied."
5,Movie,This show rules! the comic book is also really great! I would start from the very beginning with both however so you wont get lost.
5,Collection is complete,"I wanted to have the complete collection. It was a fascinating series that ended too soon.I will enjoy viewing at my lesiure dring the long, cold winter months in the north."
1,Dont believe the positive,"reviews on this one. Its shallow and horrible. Ideas at best, but no way a ""how to"" bible. I'm suspicious about the positives."
4,BUY IT FOR THE INFOPRENEURING CHAPTER ALONE!,"As a fellow author I realize that some people only respond publicly when they have something to criticize. This is definitely NOT a 1 star book! The well-chosen quotations add needed wisdom to this financial strategy book. I'm not a very big supporter of Network Marketing or the Accelerated Money Strategies because they both punish the novice in terms of time, money and effort. The risk is understated in both of these cases and I wish these chapters were not included in Robert's book. But the real gem of this book is the chapter on Infopreneuring (it's worthy of being a book in itself) His use of the fishing metaphor to illustrate his concepts is also, coincidentally, in line with my book, Men Are Like Fish."
2,Do not waste your money!,"This guy is a huckster - short and simple. I have owned rental real-estate for over ten years, and let me tell you, it is a lot of work! I only own four units, but I had eight at one time. He makes is sound so easy - well, it isn't. That is not to say it has not been a good investment - but just be aware that it is work - and there is no such thing as no money down if you do not have a good job and great credit. Let's be real. Also, the foreclosure market - be sure you have at least $80,000 in cash - because that is what it takes to buy a foreclosure from an auction - CASH! I did follow Mr. Allens advice from Creating Wealth about investing in graded rare coins - and I lost thousands of $$! Come on people - if he makes so much money from his own investments, why does he need to sell books and seminars?? Real wealth building takes discipline, lots of saving and hard work - I would stay away from this book if you want build wealth."
2,Thought provoking first chapter,"I rate this book 2 stars primarily for the first chapter. The first chapter did change the way that I look at the value of a single dollar. This chapter at least is worth reading as for the rest, I'm not so sure. I do disagree with and am suspicious of some of the adamantly negative reviewsI've read. Mr. Allen's ideas are worth a look and are thought provoking at least."
1,Multiple Streams of Spam,"I have not read this book, but I have received SPAM advertising it. If this guy is a respectable author, does he have to spam to advertise?I'd keep away from his work."
1,Count your fingers and keep your hand on your wallet!,"It's incredible that people buy this stuff. I guess a good way to make money is to write a book telling people how to make money. A good eye-opener is to consider the source: Check out some websites about this author, [...] that covers this author's problems with the IRS and bankruptcy, etc. Not sure how much of it all is true, but what he writes doesn't leaves alot to be desired in my opinion."
1,SPAM artist milks the rubes,"It doesn't take a genius to get rich if you are willing to drop your ethics along the way. The fact that this guy is a spam artist as well as a get-rich-quick snake oil salesman should be enough of a warning to those with any sense. I feel pity for the suckers who are desperate enough to chase these empty promises, but they are born every minute."
4,Economist Viewpoint on Practical Methods of Wealth,"As an economist, this book is definitely worth buying if you want some practical ideas of how to save for retirement and to view debt in a realistic way.Too many people today seem to think that money will always be available to them, regardless of any practical understanding of it. This book, alone, gives a clear understanding of what money is and isn't. This book will give you a much larger understanding of why debt does not really help your buying power but instead creates risk on any long-term goals for your family, and many generations to come.Applying this book to a frugal lifestyle can help anyone wanting to live debt free.The only con side is that this assumes you have enough income to apply to these methodologies. Otherwise, if you know how to compensate these methods to fit your income it will be more useful for a larger group of readers."
1,Woooooeeeeee,"Want a better read? Read up on Mr. Allen's background on the internet, for freeeeeeeee! It's got much better info than this rag."
3,Packed with useful information,"Robert Allen has wrtten a excellent book on creating diverse streams of income. From basic network marketing to tax liens, discounted mortgages amd franchising.If you are interested in diversifying your income or a career change, this book could be your ticket.I also suggest Cashing in on Cash Flow by Laurence Pino for even more cash flow strategies."
2,Not Worth It,The 8 CD's are a poorly produced and a very dated compliation of old material. The information flow is disjointed and there are numerous references to other material that is not included. Save your money.
1,I hate spam about as much as I hate republicans,"This Allen took the liberty to spam me, so I thought I would take the liberty to bash his book. Who thinks they can get rich by reading a paperback book? People who live in trailer parks who can't articulate a sentence to save their lives buy these books in the hopes of getting rich. Do they really think the rich are going to give away the ""code"" to success to them? Please, this Allen guy will walk on your back as he has walked on others. Go ahead ""Joe Lunchbox,"" send him the little money you have. Go buy a suit, spend $6 on a haircut, borrow some money from your great uncle for startup cash, and get into your minivan and go make some money!! I believe in you."
4,Great meaty book,"This book is even a good starter book as Allen starts by giving some of the best applicable advice for everyday personal finances and saving. Then Allen explains the 8 or so different types of income in a straight forward yet entertaining way. After reading any one of the sections, you have the knowledge to put the ideas into practice right away.If you need a low fluff introduction to different types of investments that produce income, this is it!"
1,horrible book,"i read this book at Borders over the course of my winter break this must be one of the worst books ever written save urself the moneyi wont go into details since theres plenty of detailed reviewswould u invest in stocks with the advice from a bankrupt real estate ""guru"""
1,Bad Investment,Robert Allen's book is a waste of time and money. He explores topics that are not reasonable for the average consumer. He gets the juices flowing for most people by dangling the possibilities of vast fortunes in front of his readers. He doesn't deliver. I've found other programs of his to be a disappointment as well. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!
5,Financially Free Thanks to Bob,"This book is amazing! I learned so much applicable information and if you're smart enough to follow through on his ""upsells"" (as one pessimistic reviewer calls it) you too will find financial freedom. My first real estate deal netted me FIFTEEN TIMES the total amount I ever paid for any of Robert Allen's programs. And to prove that he's not all about the money, I was allowed to start his program with no money down. I've spend thousands of dollars on other so called consultants so I know I am qualified to say that ""BOB"" is the REAL DEAL. This book is the key to the door of financial freedom. But don't take my word for it go to www.millionairehalloffame.com, you'll see me and other likeminded people fulfilling our dreams. Hope to see you there."
2,Scattershot,"Multiple is right. He glosses over almost any type of ""investment"" you could think of. I have ""investment"" in quotations because some are dubious. Network marketing is one of his subjests that comes to mind. Any time someone throws this many subjects for ""investment"" at you, you wonder just how much is going to be covered and just how much knowledge the author really has in each particular area. Allen is mainly known for real estate investing. So you wonder if he really intimately knows about all the subjects covered or just did a little research on the internet or at the library and wrote a few pages about each(which by-the-by is all you get on most topics.)"
1,Big scammer,"This like all of his products, and sadly I've bought a number of them over a short period of time is alot of hype and little meat if any. In fact some of his real estate ideas can land you in jail like the head of his investment group in atlanta found out. If he's so successful why did he declare bankrupcy in CA in 1996 while 400,000 dollars delenquent on taxes? Ask him to post the actual properties he's bought in the last year."
2,it's just so easy!,"This is an interesting book, if for no other reason than that it got me thinking on how to make money. However, the examples did not factor in costs (taxes, fees, etc.). Mr Allen, in this book, does give the reader one big long infomercial. This book lacked specifics. He also admits in the book that alot of these expensive seminars these infopreneurs give simply re-hash info from their cheaper products (books, audiotapes, etc.). This made me suspect how useful the suggestions in this book really were. It's an ok place to start your thinking!"
3,Okay book,"I read through the entire book and used my hilighter pen. A year later, all I remember is that I should buy index funds rather than individual stocks. As a person who already has multiple streams of income, I didn't find another option that appealed to me, but I do think that others could. I recommend Jim Cramer's Real Money if you are interested in learning the basics about stock investment."
1,Harassment Anyone?,"I made the mistake of ordering Robert Allen's book over the Internet, through an unsolicited email. BIG MISTAKE. The book was nothing more than a rah-rah, you too can make a fortune being an aggressive, harassing pain in the neck and walking into people's homes and saying ""Hey, I own your house!"" And, if I had no morals, no ethics, no scrupples and wanted money at all cost I'd follow along, especially the chapter where he talks about getting a good deal selling his grandmother. Actually, you could knock over a bank which is quicker. Yes, Robert Allen makes millions of dollars thanks to his pushy aggressive, annoying sales team who call constantly even after you've asked to be taken off of their list. They pester millions of people worldwide until they buy his products. Someday someone, perhaps the IRS, will catch up with Allen but until then he will make money at everyone's expense. Steer clear... I imagine cult leaders make a lot of money too, and Allen isn't far removed."
4,Solid Book !,I have read many financial / investment books - this one is quite good - well worth reading for ALL levels !
4,"If you own a business, or want to .....read this book to grow your sales BIG TIME","The simple strategies in this book can be the difference from your small business staying small(shrinking) or it exploding.Book points out the ""gold"" in your own customer list and how to create, expand and benefit from all of the relationships you have built in your business.As a small business owner taking just a few steps from this book will help us increase sales using no extra money, just our time to work with our existing customer.Use your web site for more than just a place for people to look at or read about what you do, make it a BIG asset.If you have been in business for a while and think that just having a web site is engough, you are missing out on additional income AND it is much easier to capture than finding new customers the hard and expensive way."
2,Convict,wasnt this guy up on charges for some of his dubious real estate investment scams? This book is worthless by the by. Doesnt go into enough depth on any of its topics
1,Can you Smell the Stench,"coming from the warehouse that holds all these books? Cause man this one stinks. PLEASE, PLEASE dont waste any dough on this one."
5,Multiple Strams of Income,"WOW! What can I say? This is the best Book I have read on this subject, and I've read lots of them!I am a single mom with 2 boys, no child support. In following some of the great advice on Robert's book, I have made more money this month than I've ever made before and this is just the begining...!! One happy Mom, two happy kids! All thanks to Robert G. Allen.This is not a book, this is a WAY OF LIFE!Monica Zaidenweber"
2,Not Worth the Cover Price,"The book starts out with great chapters on strategies for making money. As it wears on, the ways to add ""a stream of income"" become more and more abstract...and ridiculous if you ask me. Robert G. Allen is more interested in pluggin other books, progrmas, seminars, network marketing companies, etc than writing a sound personal finance book. He attepts to squeeze the reader for more and more money by asking you to visit his website where his buddies have ""streams of income"" waiting for you...at a cost. Overall, the book has some very good points and strategies but you have to sift throgh the crud to get to the good stuff. I have also learned that although you should not judge a book by its cover, any book with a sparkling cover should not be purchased. If you need a cover like that to get somone's attention you didn't write a very good book."
1,Chapter 22 - How to get rich panhandling,"Is about the only chapter you wont find in this slop. I dont know why he left that one out. He wrote a few pages about anything else he could think of. You would probably make more money begging on a street corner than with what this joker proposes. What a pathetic job this convict author has done.Please read through all the reviews and get a good picture about what is going on. Notice the same theme in all the cult-like glowing, positive reviews? Makes you wonder what kind of stake all these reviewers have in the success of this book."
1,fake news website,"Robert Allen have taken to using fake news websites to promote his products, particularly the Multiple Streams of Income package.In them they deceive customers with a fabricated story of a young single Mom who solves her financial woes with the Multiple Streams of Income kit. These advertorials make people believe that they can be making over 300 dollars a day with little to no work.Buy a book about real estate or stock market investing instead, Robert G allen have a lot of big words, but are in big financial trouble himself. check him out on the internet."
2,I'd pass...,"Good read, enjoyable, well written... but I read this book to gain what it claims to deliver. And deliver it did not. While this book caused me to come forth with one good idea, I would hesitate to recommend this to anyone.Don't be fooled by books that claim to have sure-fire ways of making you big bucks. Snake oil and hubris, I say!Do you really want to know HOW TO GET RICH?Try an invaluable book called ""The Mind Accelerator""-- now this is straight and concentrated strategy for ultra success."
1,"Hey, I'm Robert A.....","and I've sent my army to pump up the reviews of this book by hyping it with five stars and almost religous reviews, while saying that those who have voted negatively against the book that their reviews were of no help. Hope no one noticed. Well, if you did, dont pay any attention, it's just a coincidence."
1,Crapatola,"Universal life insurance, rare coins, network marketing? If these are what this huckster considers investments, count me as one of the non believers. No one should consider these as worthy investments. This guys background is real estate ( and a dubious one at that if you look at his criminal background.) Just how much can he know about investing in these other areas. Best investment advice? Dont waste your money on this one."
1,¡Que libro tan malo ! ¿Por qué?,"Porque está lleno de frases manidas, de lugares comunes que no nos dejan más beneficio que un sermón aburrido.El libro no comienza mal..Tampoco bien..pero va decayendo al extremo de que ni siquiera por disciplina lo puide terminar. ¡Qué lástima de mis nueve dólares !"
2,Too Predcitable.,"This movie I just found too predictable and figured it early. FF and yup I was right about everything. It's just strange to believe That a woman would hate another woman so much and she would go through all this trouble. I just didn't by the film because the motives behind it all were just too...well shallow. This might have been a good movie in the hands of better writers. The entire Kidney thing is just a sub plot you can figure out 30 minutes in. Sadly it's supposed to be a strong point of this movie because it revolves around this organ jacking business and it fails. Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance this movie isn't. I gave this move 2 stars because I enjoyed watching the ""bad kidney girl"" suffer. Her character was pretty annoying and needy and those few scenes rewarded me with a reason to watch then than skip over it.Overall this movie is so so and it gets a so so rating."
5,Urban Legends,"Urban Legends, while many times seem to be an American thing, often over lap in other cultures. Koma is basically the story about the infamous waking up in a bathful of ice finding an internal organ missing.Granted, your probably thinking been there, seen that, as I was before I watched it. However with enough twists and creepy dialogue through the movie, this psychological thriller turns from bland to thought provoking."
5,Love this film!,One of the best of Hong Kong in my opinion. I really love this movie--if you love asian cinema this is definitely one to see!
3,original interesting thriller victim of a poor DVD treatment by Tartan...,"This movie is remarkably engaging. Some lunatic is stealing people's kidneys bringing terror to a young girl in particular. She suspects her boyfriend's former fling is behind all these gruesome mutilations.Some kind of personal vendetta theory that proves to be wrong in the end.Filled with twists and surprises, the storyline is entertaining and original to the eye.Nevertheless, Tartan made a poor transfer of this movie.White speckles are ever present throughout the picture and a lot of the scenes present shaky and jumpy images.it becomes annoying and you would expect these flaws from older movies, not movies made recently.Tartan needs to do better transfers if they wish to be considered a serious studio,the same transfer problems are present in Wishing Stairs for instance."
1,Don't buy this $4.95 eBook,The $4.95 eBook is not digital edition of Peter Senge's book. It is merely a 14-page introduction to the book.
5,Very enjoyable children's toy,"My daughter received this as a present for her 3rd birthday. As soon as it was put together, she was on it riding circles around the house. She was able to mount it and reach the foot pedal without any problem. She enjoys the novelty of having a ""motorcycle"" when her friends in the neighborhood have just cars. It does well on pavement and doesn't have a sharp turn radius (i.e. could turn over without supervision). When she goes out in the yard with it, she often gets stuck. It does come with training wheels. The recommended age is until age 7. While the toy looks durable, I am not sure my daughter will be able to play with it until age 7 due to her possible size and interest. She does love it now though. There are 2 speeds. According to the stickers, it is made in Italy and is ""officially licensed by Vespa""."
1,Quality not so good,"The design look and concept behind this scooter is great, but the quality of the electronics and fit/finish leaves a lot to be desired. We purchased two of the Peg Perego Vespa's and two Pocket-Mod Razor's for Christmas for our girls. The Razor's were $50 less, and are still working flawlessly. BOTH vespa's have broken twice each (electronic circuit board fails). Peg Perego sent us replacement circuit boards, which are difficult to remove and replace, and they operated once again for a short period of time, then same result.The Vespa is constructed completely out of molded plastic, that does not seem to hold up well. In addition, the electronics are obviously low quality. Look into Razor's for scooters. Quality metal construction with real rubber tires (not plastic like the Peg Vespa), and they seem to be much more durable."
1,less than a brochure,This 'execubook' was a complete waste of money. I had skimmed the introduction for this book at the bookstore and thought I would be downloading an electronic copy that I could read on the plane. This 'book' is about a dozen pages in very large print - it has less information than a typical hotel brochure. I am incredibly disappointed and will not be downloading any e-books from Amazon.com in the future.
3,"Interesting Intro, quick read","I loved the beginning of the book where Willow discusses magic and physics - very fascinating and not over my head! The rest of the book gives examples of different experiences in connecting with the divine. This book is a good ""next step"" from the beginner books."
4,"The Veil's Edge, well worth reading!","I found this book to be well written, intrigueing and full of valuable ideas and perceptions. I have been a long time fan of M Macha Nightmare's writing. This is the first time I have read Willow Polson's work, but it certainly will not be the last.The treatment of subject is sure to give new insights to anyone interested in the practice of the magickal arts. A mature and enciteful approach to mystical and spiritual matters.A Great Read!"
1,Sadly disappointing,"When I first bought this book, I thought I was going to get some interesting perspectives on some of the lesser-travelled paths of the Witch. Instead, I found this book to barely graze the surface of its subject matter. The author appears to be dancing around the edges of her material in hopes of appealing to an audience hungry for more advanced fare, but far too many subjects are explored for this 224 page book to be effective at conveying its intended message."
4,A solid adapter,"I used this in conjunction with a D-Link PCMCIA wifi card to share a cable internet connection between two Windows-2000 based systems via built-in Internet Connection Sharing in an ad-hoc network. The adapters themselves performed reasonably well, the connection would occasionally drop out but a restart of either the client or the host computer would always restore the connection, possibly there was a better solution but I didn't really try anything since that worked. Possibly not for beginners, there are some configuration issues those types might not be comfortable with. But I found it to be a piece of cake."
4,Works with linux,"only 4 stars because I need to download linux-wlan-ng, which isn't shipped with the kernel, but that's the only complaint; it works with wavemon too. It is nice and compact, enough so that a *shorter* USB A-B cable would be an advantage, for packing in a laptop case."
3,drops connection with 614+ router using xp,"shows excellent signal strength but then for no reason looses connection for a few seconds then connects back up, does this constantly, tried changing channel to 6 and that helped a bit, I am going to try to flash the bios in the 614AP. Any help on this one?"
3,Good overall product,"I also have a d_link DWL-1000AP so the setup of this item was very straightforward. Hooked it up to the client PC and set a few IP configurations and I was wired to my network and internet. Speed is as good as the wired PC's for internet access. The only fault I can find is that with WEP enabled I cannot get to the internet. My network connection seems to be fine though. Customer service impossible to get too, they tell you to leave a message and they will call back. I am running windows 2000 server and professional on the PC's in my network and the help files do not work in those versions of windows. I am trying to get the help files for my OS but no luck so far. The three star rating is more for service and support than for the product itself."
5,"Very easy setup, but ...",I purchased the DWL-120 along with a DI-713P wireless router. The setup for the DWL-120 was per the manual until I rebooted the computer at which time Windows 98 failed boot up with protection error message. Computer would not complete a boot up until DWL-120 was disconnected. After computer booted I could plug in DWL-120 and it would work fine until next reboot. Computer is an AMD 450 with MVP3 chip set running Windows 98. After much troubleshooting I was able to narrow problem to shared interrupt. I turned off video card interrupt in BIOS and computer booted nominally with DWL-120 connected.I'm not sure if this is a problem with my hardware or the DWL-120 driver but everything works great now. Very satisfied.
2,The D-Link disappoints.,"While the thought of being able to simply plug-and-play and get 802.11 wireless networking is appealing, the d-link doesn't deliver. The installation was fairly simple, requiring only a quick reboot (after setting IP addresses, etc). But! I have never been able to get more than 2Mbps out of this device, even 2 feet from the AP. I have a laptop with built-in wireless, and it easily gets 6mbps. Also, my Win98 computer is less than reliable while using the D-Link... Windows blue-screens after a short while -- generally when transferring moderate to large amounts of data.In all, you'd do best to check out the USB solutions from other manufacturers (I know for a fact Lucent ORINOCO and Linksys have similar products)."
3,A good resource for parents,"I picked up a copy of this at my local library this summer and have checked it out and renewed it several times. Our library has a very good movie section and I can easily find the titles included here. My children and I have enjoyed viewing many movies that never would have occurred to me to select. Each summer I plan to go farther and farther into the book, although I doubt we will ever see all 100!The author does a good job of explaining why the movie was chosen and gives a lot of interesting background information. Sometimes the description for a particular movie might run two pages or more. My only suggestion would be to categorize the movies by genre. It is organized alphabetically, which is not the way the movies are organized in our library. There is also an appendix with an additional 100 (I think) movies to consider."
1,Returning seat today,"We bought this seat for our 2 year old and are returning it to the store today. It was impossible to put together as it seemed the metal bars were not bent correctly and neither my husband, father-in-law or I could get the screws in. We're really disappointed, but will spend the extra money on a better product."
3,VERY hard to put together,"I was so excited to get this seat!!! But when I got it home and started to put it together well... The seat support bracket thingys... was bent all to @#$%. But I WAS going to make this work. After fighting with this very poorly made product for about three hours...I got it!!! Well now that it IS put together my 16 month old son is in bed ,so we will see how much fun it is tommrow...I think with this product, (as with all) you get what you pay for."
4,Great for kids and parents!,"After having two kids and trying to get active again my husband and I came across this. We installed one on my husbands bike and another on mine. From the very first time we set the kids in there and took them for a ride it was great. they both ended up falling asleep while my husband and I got a bit of excercise and relaxation. However, my 3 year old is on the taller side and she could hit the tires with her feet. So, we had to stop using it. But, it was good while it lasted."
5,Great seat!,"This is a great seat! It was a bit tricky to install, but I'm not sure about what other reviewers said about the supports being ""bent wrong."" I initially put the support bars on backwards, but realized my mistake. Maybe those reviewers had them on reversed.Anyways, nice seat, my 2 year old loves it!"
1,You get what you pay for,"I am at a loss to understand how anyone can give a positive review for this child carrier. It's not worth it even if someone gave it to your for free. There's no way a child can be comfortable in this. The first bike I tried it on, the carrier sat too close to the bike's seat. The ride was uncomfortable for both me and my son. I returned the bike and got another model in hopes that the carrier would be a better fit on it. Guess what? I couldn't even install the carrier on that bike. The instructions on the carrier say that it would fit most 26"" bikes. That's a lie. I ended up returning the bike and carrier."
2,You need the right kind of bike,"My wife bought this seat on recommendations from a friend's husband. The first bike I tried would not take it. It is somewhat crucial that your seat adjustment bolt is level with or higher than the top of your back wheel. Her's wasn't, so we couldn't use it. Then we bought another bike at a yard sale, and I put it on there. On this bike the child seat contacts the rear brakes, so they are no longer functional, and the grabby bar on the child seat is hanging over the bike seat a bit. It would be nice to back the seat away a little. My recommendation would be to go to a bike shop and ask their opinion OR feel comfortable fabricating parts for your seat.Also, the picture on the box shows better hardware than they gave me to assemble with. If I had that hardware it would work nicely."
1,BELL should be ashamed of themselves!!!,I understand that you get what you pay for but come on BELL! We have 5 bikes ranging from $50-$2000 and it wouldn't fit any of them! It would be easy to install on a really old or really cheap bike with the old style seat clamp. If you are really friendly with your local hardware store or bike shop you probably will be able to rig it to work with some additional hardware. I'm just super disappointed with Bell...they will be getting a complaint from me on Monday when they open up!
4,works great,"Great sellers, got freebies. The item was a described. The Python worked beautifully no leaks fast and easy. however I could not figure out how to hook it up to my inside sink and to run it to outdoors water hose bib and worked like a charm. So that is the reason for only 4 stars"
2,monster x strikes back,"it might be good but no English dub, needs to be in English. alot of these japanese films need to be transferred in English."
4,What you expect from Troma?,"Troma is probably the one source for constant, nonstop entertainment. The first movie, Wiseguys VS Zombies was alright but I cant say because I have so many other movies I want to view, that I stopped watching it. The second movie, Meat for Satan's Icebox was bad but in a good way. The acting was terrible and some parts didnt sync up with the dialogue. It looked like it was made right in my backyard. So thats what kind of made this movie kind of creepy, it looked like it could happen anywheres. I have no regrets buying these movies and I will watch Wiseguys vs Zombies soon. Meat for Satan's Icebox is diffently worth watching."
4,A better sounding cd/mp3 player,"I ordered this cd player because of its low profile and light weight since I plan to use it on my frequent plane trips. The sound quality of this player, when used with the supplied earbuds, is acceptible. If a decent noise-cancelling over-ear headphone is used, such as the Bose or the Sony, then the sound is comparable to a good stereo. I noticed a faint buzz (higher than the typical 60 Hz hum) when the noise cancelling circuitery is turned on. May be there is a component in the player than picked up noise from near by electrical sources. Otherwise a very good cd player from Panasonic that is still built in Osaka, Japan."
5,Blessed,"This album is truly inspired, songs like Soon As I Get Home, And Hallelujah Anyhow are the highlight of this album. A must for those who love true Gospel music at its finest."
2,"I was all set to love this product, but...","It broke the first day. I was at the gym with that day's routine stored in the database when the screen froze. Soft reset. Sync. Soft reset. Error message. Hard reset now impossible. Called tech support. Not familiar with that error message. (If not them...?) Tech support would call back. Had a replacement in my hands before tech support called back. (They never did.) I'm giving it another try because even though my experience was frustrating and the software isn't perfect, the idea is a good one. Still, consider buying a Handspring Visor (more reliable) and just get the Palm software. If the Vivonic hardware fails again, that's what I'll do. (Plus I'll be back with a one-star review.)"
1,Vivonic out of business,"I am amazed that this product is still being sold. Vivonic went out of business years ago, so there is absolutely no support for this product or the software."
3,Okay Read,This book was okay it was straight to the point and sometime predictable but i enjoyed it for the most part. The ending left you hanging and i'm not sure if i want to read a part 2
4,A PAGE TURNER!,"I finished this novel in 2 days, as it was filled with suspense, humor, and much drama! Ashlei is destined to make her presence known in the entertainment industry, but her determination for trying to get the ""connects"" lands her into some very desperate situations. This novel leaves you wanting to get to the end, to see how things turn out. Let me give ya a hint: I can't wait for the sequel. Ms. Grundy has outdone herself with this captivating novel!"
5,Gotta Have It is all That!!!!,"Shawna is on point with this one. I love a book that I pick up and can't put down until I finish the last page!! I read this book in one day. It's the bomb!!! It's a must read. I love the Philly setting and the poetic lyrics are on the money. Ashlei and her firends are something else. There's drama, love, heartache, heartbreak, intrigue, sex, you name it. Gotta have it has it! This is a must read for everyone and I give it my best endorsement. I can't wait for the author's next book!!!Cheryl Sistahs' with a Vision"
1,BORING,"This book was horrible. I really thought it was going to be good because of all the good reviews, but it wasn't. I was really disappointed. All I know is that I wasted my money on this book."
5,Great Stuff,I've been detailing cars for over 20 years.This is by far the best stuff I've ever used. It lasts as long as traditional waxes and takes about 1/2 the time to apply.
4,Learn from the other posts!,"I also have a dark colored car that I used this on and did have some streaking. By re-applying another coat (being careful not to put too much on) corrected the problem as suggested by other reviewers. While the car really shines (I used a clay bar and detailer beforehand), the finish this product leaves is not slippery as regular waxes. This really isn't a problem, just don't expect a slick surface when you are done. I think the more I use it, the more I will like it."
3,A good starting place for Christian Bible study,This was the first study guide that my Christian Men's Group used to get a start with Bible studies. I think it's a good start to think about some basic concepts and really some of the most important themes of Christianity. It was a good guide to start because it didn't require a ton of knowledge of the Bible to get going.
5,Life Rules through unspoken rules,Hits the target. Andy Stanley is an excellent communicator and teacher. Helps to realize that everyday life is peppered with subtle issues that infiltrate our christian life.
4,'Insightful.,"The intro skits are hard to take, but Andy's lectures are stellar, as always. 'Time and money well spent. 'Well received by our adult Sunday school class."
1,WORSE HAIR CREAM EVER!,"I used it and followed all the instructions at the back of the bottle, and didn't do any effect on my hair even if the I let it stay in my hair for 30 minutes. I'm very disappointed, it feels like I just wasted my money by buying this stuff.. :("
1,Rubbish,"The contents of the jar I received were lemon-scented, with the consistency of watery play-doh. I can only assume that someone mixed the ink from a scented marker with some play-doh and kept the hair dye for themselves, since the lemon-doh did not change the color of my hair whatsoever."
2,Too Dark,i bought this punky color turqouise to go over my light magenta hair based on the premise red & blue make purple well i only left it on for 30 min tops no heat and it turned my hair jet blue black disappointed next time i will use manic panic
5,"Great Color, watch out for bleeding though...","This is the best hair color in the ""non-natural color"" line that I have found. It is long lasting, even more so if combined with L'anza brand Trauma Treatment leave-in conditioner. The color is vibrant and ""Plum"" is more of a true purple, whereas ""Purple"" is more on the pink end, with ""Violet"" more on the blue end.Be warned, it will stain EVERYTHING! For the first week after application, be careful what you wear as it will stain the back of the neck of any shirt you wear and put a towel over your pillowcase or it will stain too. The good thing is, if it's white, bleach will take it right out. Also, use Easyoff Kaboom bathroom cleaner on your sink and shower, and you will never know that it was once purple/blue/red/green... To me it's worth it to have such an incredible color, I receive compliments everyday from complete strangers!"
5,punkerific :),I've had just about every color you can imagine and though I wouldn't want to age myself when I started dyeing my hair crazy colors they didn't have pink or purple hair dye. the point is after using about 3/4 of the dye on the market I ADORE Punky color. The Punky I just received from here was fresh (Yes it can go stale). It came super quick.
4,Magenta hair,"I wanted to get dark purple hair, I didnt know what color to get at first to I just went with purple. The first time I put on the dye, my hair was a magenta color. I put some more on later on since I didnt get all the hair, and it turned a darker shade of magenta. The color looks really nice, but I was going for a dark purple/violet shade. I think when it fades, I will buy the plum or violet color. The hair dye itself smells really good, like grapes."
4,Nice Dark Green,"I really liked this color, it was a nice, dark emerald green. I've had it in for a month now, and it's just starting to fade out!"
5,"Lovely product, great color","I didn't bleach my hair and the color still comes out bright and vibrant. It washes out pretty quickly, but it fades nicely so it's okay. Love the color and the product arrived quickly."
4,Great dye,"On yellow-blonde hair, this dye comes out to be more turquoise than blue. I was disappointed that it wasn't a vibrant royal blue as I expected, but the color was gorgeous either way. This is the longest lasting dye I've tried. Overall, the color wasn't as blue as expected, but is still an amazing dye and I would recommend it."
4,awsomeeeee but it leaked,i absoutly loved this color i dyed it in my hair last ngiht but the only down fall was that when i opened my package when i recived it i noticed around the plastic shrink wrap that was used to keep the cover sealed i noticed that the hair dye had leaked and it was i the plastic wrap so i got it on my fingers when i took it off so i would just say try to package it with it standing up or usesomething so it wont leake but i love the product love the price and love the color =)
3,Stay out of the sun!,It's a pretty colour until you spend too much time out in the sun. The sun completely obliterated the colour from my hair.
5,Amazing!!,"I bought this with an experimentational mindset (after being disappointed with the wella products i tried) and i got perfect results, the first time! it took really no experience to use.. just apply where you want it and let it set for about a 1/2 hour. it isn't permanent, but its about a month later and i still have color!! (a bit lighter, but still there!) i also barely had to use any of the product, so this little bottle with last me forever. awesome!! :)"
2,Washed out after 2 washes,Bought this for my daughter and she has dirty blonde hair. We put it in waited and rinsed it out. After the first wash it was fine but the second wash took all the color out
1,not pleased,"Let me start off by saying that I have been dying my hair with semi-permanent hair dye for over a decade.I have used a wide range of colors and am aware that results vary by hair type and condition.I was very let down to see upon opening the dye that its actually navy blue and not ebony as labeled.The color is extremely off. I will add that I did go ahead and give it a chance, still the results were terrible.Ebony means black not dark blue. disappointed."
1,Expected a darker green...,The color wasn't what I had expected. It wasn't anywhere near the shade of green that it was suppose to be. I've been dyeing my hair for 7 years myself and decided to try this brand because I'd never heard of it before. However I must say it did smell good.
3,manic is better,The color was alright and it lasted for about 1 month and a half. I prefer manic's midnight blue better due to its various shading. This one definitely bleeds alot and it does stain everything my head rests on. The staining lasted for about 2 weeks.
3,Wish it would last longer!,"It is a very pretty color but it rinses out so quick, the first time i did it a few weeks ago it washed out within a day or two. then i re did it and now its lasted about a a week and a half so far but i left it in like for an hour. be sure to watch when u wash ur hair it can stain ur tub. i also have a purple jerome punky colour and i love it also can stain big time tho lol so be careful"
2,Maybe if I were blonde!,I'm sure this is great for people with light hair. My hair was a light auburn this turned it black pretty much. You can very VERY faintly see purple... It's staining everything however! lol. This did work better than Manic Panic for me. It's alright.
1,OK,"It was OK,but we have dark hair so it didn't shown up on us. I'll not dye my 8&9 yrs old girl 4 the dye. I'll just have 2 remember that product did work 4 us."
3,no i get neither purple nor white,"don't really know what's going on but didn't see effective result. the effect is just like the purple shampoo i'm currently using. because of the 1st bleach, i've already got very light shade on the bangs. and when i'm ready for this product, it's after 3rd bleaching, orange definitely gone, bangs almost white. the label declare that peroxide isn't needed and 45min after application, the bangs did turn ""white"" and the rest remain light yellow. totally not a significant result. or maybe i didn't use it in appropriate way? don't know.."
5,Zero cons.,"I love this dye. I wanted my hair purple for awhile, so I decided to give this dye a try & experimented with my own ideas. I wanted my hair to be like a barney color, & I ended up creating it myself. If you're going to dye your hair blue or purple with these dyes, I reccomend getting the darkest dye possible, & mixing a ton of WHITE conditioner with a little bit of the color, till it gets to the color you desire. It saves you SOOO much dye. I bought 3 jars, the first time I dyed my hair & extensions with this dye I only used a half of one jar. When you have the mixture in your hair, leave it anywhere from 3 or more hours & rinse. When you do shower, never use shampoo. I use garnier frutics color sheild conditioner & nothing else on my hair. Also make sure you use cold water. I haven't had to redye & my hair has been purple for about 4 months."
4,Punky colour,"Although it was a little darker than I expected, It was amazing. The color came out the first time and only took 20 minutes!! <3 I will never go back to Manic panic, More expensive and fades faster."
2,"Love this dye, but shipping...","I've been a loyal user of this dye for a really long time now, I think I've ordered at least 6 of these in the past 6 months xD But this time around the shipping was incredibly slow (I STILL don't have it) and I really needed it today so I could redye my hair before a concert I'm going to tonight. Sigh. I'm mostly disappointed because in the past I've received my orders within 4 days of placing them, and it's been a week. Oh well. I'd recommend this product to anyone wanting perfectly purple hair, but if you need it fast, use another seller :/"
3,BEST on Blonde,"I have African american Black hair.I use this product and left it on overnight and it tinted my hair color , you could see it very good in the light. its like a purply-pink deep dark color. overall im impressed because of how it tinted but i think it will work best on blonde or prelightened hair. oh btw rinse this with COLD water :)"
2,too dark,"I bleach my hair before any dying so the color takes well, but this turned out too dark, it's like black and only purple when light's shined on it, it smells good though"
2,Not Semi-permanent IMO,I bought this for my daughter. She wanted streaks in her hair and I didn't see the point in buying something that would wash right out. I did some research and this product got pretty good reviews so this is what I decided to use. I washed her hair right before and did not condition. I dried her hair and then added this product. My daughter has non treated dirty blonde hair. I left this product on for an hour. Using heat from the dryer to help it stain the hair. After rinsing and conditioning her hair was left with a beautiful purple color that she totally loved. It lasted 1 shower. Now you can barely see it!! It went from this vibrant purple to barely there!! Totally disappointed!
1,Color not as pictured,"I saw this and thought it was a very bright red,I purchases the purple and it was amazing,unfortunatelly I have to send this order back for a refund,I am sure alot of people will like it this is not the bright red I had expected"
3,Apple Teal? Apple Aqua?,"I used this on nearly platinum bleached hair, and the result is a VERY pretty and Very bright shade of blue. Not green, not even a greenish blue, but pretty much blue verging into aqua. It's beautiful, and i hope it lasts, but it's not what i was expecting."
2,Very subtle..,"Very subtle. Also similar to Manic Panic. Looks ok when it is newly on, then rinses out off putting pink color. In no rush to use it again. Doesn't color gray very well, even salonist said so when cutting my hair."
5,Love This Prodcut!,"I have been using the Jerome Russell Punky COlor for years now and I have not found anything that even compares to the intensity and depth of the color. I have been a colorist for 10 years now, and this is one of my favorite tools to use!"
5,Wonderful,"If you are into hair colors this Plum (Blue Purple) is for you. The Cream is really rich and thick. The staining effect of this Semi Permanent Cream is wonderful. I have washed my hair over 4 times now and the color is still brilliant. Other brands of purple would have already faded and turn bright reddish purple. With this brand and color of Plum it keeps the purple in the bluish range.It is a vibrant and brilliant color, I am really impressed and worth buying."
1,Punky Colour Atlantic Blue,"I bought this product for my daughter we were told it was better then Manic Panic, it is not! It fades very fast and when it fades its very green in color, and it rubs off on towels and bed sheets and everything else!! I would not recommend it if you are looking for lasting color."
4,Blue/Purple,I'm taking off a star because of the misleading name. To me Violet has always been a dark purple and I was shocked when it turned out to be a dark blue. After two weeks it did fade to a dark purple so in the end I was happy. The dark blue was OK but the dark purple was really pretty. The color shows up best on bleached hair.As with all Punky Colours be sure to wash your hair in cold water and it will last for many weeks. Even though I rinsed my hair really well this color did stain my pillowcase. I've used almost all the colors available and that had never happened before.Wear gloves when applying to avoid staining your hands. Wet down your shower before washing your hair and after so that it will decrease the chance of staining the shower. I do this every time and I've never had the color stain my shower.
2,"Messy, Smelly and Downright Awful!!!!!","I don't like punky colour at all!I have tried several different semi-permanent hair dyes including manic panic and splat and this is definitely the worst!To begin with, it has an awful grape medicine scent and this color bleeds like crazy! It was just...EVERYWHERE.And after all the trouble I went through, it didn't even show up on my hair!At least manic panic's vampire red tints my hair.this did pretty much nothing.never buying punky colour again.maybe it would work on someone with bleached hair."
2,Made my hair break off,"I normally use Manic Panic Rock N Roll Red or Pillarbox Red, but Sally's was closed and I needed to spruce myself up before an event the next day. So I headed over to Ulta to see what I could find. I am a huge fan of Manic Panic as it is a natural, vegan, non-damaging product and I figured Jerome Russell's Punky Color was equivalent... Not so much. The bottom inch or two of my hair has been breaking off ever since. To be fair, the color is nice and the product smells great--It does stain the hands a lot more than MP, but lasts longer in the hair. I'm not sure what the difference is in the formula, but I will definitely be going back to Manic Panic because after using MP my hair actually feels softer and more conditioned than before using it. I highly recommend Manic Panic over Jerome Russell's Punky Color."
4,Smells like candy,"I tried this after a friend suggested the brand. I had only tried Special Effects before this and while I like the color of Special Effects dyes more, they fade quickly and stain terribly. Atlantic Blue was my first try with Punky Colour and after ten days it has only faded a tiny bit and I wash my hair more often than you should with these colors. I do it daily. You should, at most, every other day. But that being said, it's still very bright and vibrant (on top of bleached hair), even with my excessive washing. I still get very blue bubbles in the shower, but I'm slowly realizing that will happen with all these pretty colored dyes. I will definitely be trying out other colors in this brand, I already have Plum for when I'm sick of Atlantic Blue."
5,Love it! Best product I've used so far.,"I bought Punky colour after reading the reviews here on amazon. I've used Manic Panic, RAW, and Sally's colors before and this one was the best I've used so far.I used it for my boyfriend mohawk, and after having a bad experience with manic panic not even sticking to the bleached hair very well, we tried Punky.It came out even and vibrant, even though his hair was still a little bit golden in some places from the bleach. It didn't change the color of the green. It was very thick and easy to put on. It came off the skin with acetone pretty easily.The color stayed in after many washes. He washes his hair almost every day and it was still very green.I reccomend this hair dye to everyone looking for a great color that sticks!"
3,its ok,"I have bought punky colors for years, but I have never bought this color before. It want what I expected it to be. It is really light and washes out way faster than any of the other colors I have bought before. It would be a really pretty color if it actually took on my hair!"
4,follow directions,shipping was fast.. but im disappointed in the results. I did not bleach my hair before hand.. which i should have done.. so my roots and some of my hair is a beautiful shade of purple.. then the rest is a very dark black.. and it REALLY DOES STAIN skin.. toook me two hours to scrub the purple off my face.. but I would deffently use the product again.. I would just follow the directions exactly this time.. and I LOVED THE WAY IT SMELLES... over all im happy with the purchase and will deffently recomend it to friends...cant wait to try a blue color...
4,"Great Color, but bleeds","This dye resulted in a really lovely purple color, but I'm giving it only 4 stars for a couple reasons. First, as others have noted, it bleeds for quite some time after you first use it. I've been using old towels to dry my hair after showers and to wrap around my pillow at night so I don't stain my pillowcase. Also I've been wearing dark clothes to make sure they don't get stained either. Not much of an issue, but slightly annoying. I also have hair that goes just past my shoulders, but it's thick and curly, and the amount of dye in this was just barely enough to cover everything--it almost wasn't enough, but I was able to comb it through to the ends. Lastly, It's only be about 5 days--that's 3 showers--and the color has noticeably faded already, but not a whole lot, and the color it's fading to is still a nice color, so I'm not concerned. All in all, worth your money."
4,Bohemian Girl,"loved this old old movie with Laurel and Hardy - however, wanted to know the name of the song (something like I dreamt???) so I could find and purchase said song...... not even mentioned in the credits"
4,Worth the buy,I bought two of these for my daughter to crawl on. Put it together and you have a cute Mat. When she gets older it's a great game (and now I have a second one as backup). Can't go wrong for the price.
2,Hopscotch,I got this for my daughters 4 and 6. They play with it once in a while. They get easily bored with it. If you can go outside and make your own hopscotch. It isn't worth the cost.
4,gets played with!,"My daughter rec'd this last Christmas. It's perfect for her American Girl doll and any ""friends"" that spend the night. You can add a cute fleece ""comforter"" to each level if you wanted more pizazz. VERY durable....this will be on to pass along to the grandchildren...."
3,Baby doll bunks...,"Nice product overall...it has, thus far, stood up to my 3y.o. for a week - though I'm sure she'll soon try to sleep in it herself.Not deal-breakers, but do note the bedding is just a thin piece of fabric with a faux pillow stitched upon it. The free standing ladder may not be appropriate for younger children. Also, we had to cut a very small piece off of the side/corner of one of the flat bed boards to assemble the unit. (Easily done with a sharp kitchen knife...)Once together the beds seem quite sturdy and were the only doll accessory I could find to fit my daughter's duo of 20"" baby dolls."
5,Little Bunk Beds for Little Granddaughter,"Bought for granddaughter for Christmas. It was very sturdy, matchedher bed almost exactly. She loved it. It was very easy to put together.I did put glue in each screw hole before connecting the screws to give itmore stability.This bed will last many years; hopefully to pass onto her childrensomeday."
4,cute bed,"Once I got this bed put together, I couldn't be more pleased. If you had asked me to write this review on Christmas Eve night when I was trying to keep all these bed parts from falling off while trying to screw them together, I would have laughed in your face. But after using both hands, one of my feet, and my teeth to keep everything in place, I screwed it together fine. I recommend you have somebody there to hold things for you so that you don't wind up crazed like me.I give it only 4 stars because the mattresses are very scant. I plan on making pillows and blankets myself; may also look into making new mattresses or adding more stuffing to the existing ones."
3,"Great price, broken product","our daughter loves this bunk bed for her american girl doll. however the ladder was cracked when received. The wood is kind of cheap, can easily crack if screwed to tightly."
4,Sweet little bunkbeds,My 5 year old really loves these bunk beds. Ours did not come with a ladder (or maybe I threw it out but that's highly doubtful) and the pink blanket you see in the picture doesn't open up so like a mattress pad and a separate blanket so my little one used a hand towel for a softer mattress than the stiff cardboard the actual bed part is made of. It's a pretty sturdy little bed if you trust your child will not sit or stand on it. It doesn't wobble or rack back and forth at all. The box has a printed picture of the contents so make sure you keep that in mind if you intend this to be a surprise for your little one.
3,Solid footboard and headboard but flimsy otherwise.,I was a little disappointed. Expensive for what it is..expectated it to be more durable. It's not awful but not great either. Better than the plastic stuff but I'm worried how long it will hold up. The bedding is average.
1,Piece of junk,"I can't understand the reviews saying this thing is durable. We bought it for our daughter for Christmas and as my husband was putting it together two side pieces split, making the bed unusable. Over half of the pieces are not wood, they are just PRESSED CARDBOARD! To top it off the bedding is a joke, it's one thin piece of stuffed fabric that looks like it came out of the 10 cent bin at the Salvation Army. Overall I am very, very disappointed in this product and will never order from this company again."
2,Leave plenty of time for a trip to the hardware store!,"Do NOT wait until Christmas Eve to put this together - just as many other reviewers have noted, mine had issues as well. The screwed wouldn't hold in the holes and were flat not tapered at the end, so no grip.Fortunately I have a slew of extras around and I was able to match it relatively well - but if you don't have a hardware store in your garage and aren't ready for the frustration, pass. Great idea but needs to be made with proper hardware to fit!"
2,"cute, but not necessarily going to last.","Very cute, but not sure how I feel about the quality. One of the holes is stripped & the screw won't stay in. I had to find another way to keep that corner together. I'm hoping the bed holds up."
4,"Nice, sturdy bunk beds","This bunk bed is nice and sturdy. It went together quite easily and while the mattress/blanket/pillow isn't high quality, it's a lot nicer than I'd expected. My daughter is pleased."
4,Gift fot Granddaughter,Our granddaughter requested a bunk bed for dolls and this one seemed well made. Her Minny Mouse and a doll sleep in it every night right by her bed. I wish there was a hook on the ladder so it would stay on the bed.
3,doll beds,Kids liked this bunk bed but was not made very sturdy....it broke after several months or so and they had to replace.
2,Cheap Quality,"To be totally honest, if you can afford to buy something similar to this from American Girl, a local crafter, or if you can build it yourself, you'd be better off. The white finish was marred and scratched, as well as not being totally painted in spots along the slats on the end pieces. When I tried to put it together, the holes for the joints hadn't been drilled deep enough. I finally gave up, put the pieces back in the box, and will rely on Grandpa to drill the holes deep enough and put it together on Christmas Day. My five year-old niece will probably thinks it's fine, but I was disgusted with the quality. But then again, it was pretty inexpensive. In this case, I got what I paid for."
4,Great buy for the money,It was easy to assemble and is perfect for my daughter's 2 american girl dolls. She loved it and I would definitely recommend it.
3,The bed is great...the bedding not so great!,"The bunk bed was quick and easy to put together. It only took me about 5 minutes to assemble the product. It is sturdy and seems like it will last through many hours of play. I am disappointed that there is no mattress for the beds. Under the pink sheet/attached pillow shown is just the board. Trying to buy a mattress to fit this bed is proving difficult so I'm going to have to construct one myself because I know my daughter will not want to put her doll right on the hard board. Other than that, this is a wonderful product."
1,Boring--The commentary does not explain what you are seeing.,"What a disappointment! I wanted to learn more about my state but just saw beautiful scenery. The minimal commentary was quotes that didn't pertain to learning about the areas of the state that I knew little about. The pacing was so slow that I fast forwarded through much of it. If you only want photos for an hour, this could work for you."
1,Pretend that the rating is 5 stars,"I give this collection 5 stars, please understand that. I just know that people are more willing to go to a 1 star review.I'm writing this to tell you that if the price is $140, WAIT. I bought the collection on Amazon for $83 after it was $140 a week before. The price for this collection fluctuates for reasons I cannot figure out.That aside, the entire collection is brilliant save for a few stupid Catwoman and Penguin episodes, but you weren't expecting greatness from those two anyway.Harley Quinn is the diamond of this series as she is born from this and thrives in this environment. She's cute, hilarious, and deadly at the same time, and her episodes (actually, any Joker episode besides Last Laugh and Christmas with the Joker) are must sees for any fan of DCAU.Fantastic collection, but please wait until the price is low (which it always comes back to) before you buy."
5,The finest version of Batman you'll ever see on a screen,"I've always liked Batman. I've never been a comic book reader, but screen versions of the character have been in my life since childhood. From the fun childhood memories of the campy old TV show (Same Bat Time, Same Bat Channel), to the much more serious Tim Burton movies, to the ok Batman Forever and awful Batman & Robin, and finally the nicely done Batman Begins, Batman has always been a franchise I enjoyed even if it wasn't a favorite.A recent obsession with all things related to Superman brought me to the DC Animated Universe. From there I finally decided to get the much praised Batman - The Animated Series. If only I'd known. Everything else I ever watched of the Caped Crusader was left behind. This is without a doubt the best screen version of Batman.If you like the character of Batman in any way, but have never seen this series, do youreslf a favor and get it."
5,Truly Complete Series,"Many electronics stores, who will remain unmentioned, only carry 3 of the 4 volumes. This is, however, the complete series. It was shipped quickly and directly through amazon.com, so I knew I could buy with confidence. Additionally, with super saver shipping, I paid the as-shown price and didn't have to worry about calculating shipping. They allowed me to track the shipment right to my door, and it was packed securely and properly.The DVDs arrived safe and sound and work without a hitch. If you like Batman - The Animated Series, and cannot find the complete series, or if you wish to buy with confidence, then I suggest you buy from amazon.com."
3,Good Corded & Cordless Phone,"Excellent phone, but battery in handset will not hold a very long charge. Less than week.Same problem with replacement battery.When battery power gets low, calls get dropped without warning."
3,Too small and not for boys,"The US Soccer logo on this shirt is great. I wish I could find it on another style shirt. I bought this for my 9 yr old soccer-playing son in size Youth Medium and it was too small (he weighs 72 lbs). The narrow sleeves and tight cuff seemed more like a girl's style shirt, not unisex, so it was returned."
4,A Wonderful Chronicle of 19th Century Fasion,"Charles Frederick Worth was one of the finest fashion designers of the 1800s. (Kind of like a Dior of the Victorian Era.) This collection includes three dolls (one of Worth, his wife, and a female model). C.F. Worth's doll only has one extra outfit, but the women have about eight to nine outfits each. The styles span the era from 1845 to 1900. The plates detail Worth's pioneering of bustle-type gowns. Day dresses, ball gowns, walking outfits, and several other dresses fill the book. The colors are varied and bright, while Tierney's drawings look well-finished. The dolls are printed on medium card-stock, which will stand up to moderate abuse. This book is a wonderful addition to anyone's collection."
4,a good book,"the way of the peaceful warrior is one of my favorite books of all time. i really enjoyed the journey of the peaceful warrior too; this was a nice add on to the story that i never wanted to end.i am glad that i read this book, but did not really feel as if i was reading the same story. this was much better than the starwars prequels, but did feel a little strained to connect this story to the others. maybe if this book was two books or twice as long i would have felt more continuity. i did enjoy this story very much and do recommend the book, but i wonder if the book could have been longer.in short my main complaint with this book is how much time spent on learning the story versus how much time is spent unlearning the story; i would have liked to spent more time in the story of the higher purpose transformation process."
5,The story comes full circle,"I have been a Dan Millman fan since the late 80's and this book is just as good as his others. Not quite ""way of the peaceful warrior"" but good never the less. It also completes the story so it makes more sense. The last part of the book describing, I beleive, a true story from Mr Millman's personal life about who socrates was and his influences on him was the best part of the book."
2,WOW element absent,"I loved Dan Millman ""peaceful warrior "" , but was unable to relate to the journey of Socrates.It lacked the beautiful storytelling and guidance in Mr. Millman initial creation.Wish him only the bestLots of loveGuy"
3,"Nice adventure, lacks the widsom of the other two Peaceful Warrior books","The Journeys of Socrates is a nice adventure novel, however if you have read The Peaceful Warrior or The Journeys of the Peaceful Warrior before, and you expect similar wisdom or spiritual teachings, you will be probably disappointed. Only one conversation between Socrates and the monk Serafim about God delivers food for thought (and heart) in this area. At least it's a nice story that shines light where the peculiar ""Peaceful Warrior"" term is coming from."
3,Great book but not Millman's best,"I love Dan Millman's work overall, but this book was a pretty radical departure from a form of dialogue-based fiction he does very well. The story contains a lot of scene-building narrative and descriptive writing. It reads more like a historical novel than his other works. But I specifically had a hard time with the ratio of violence and drama over solid teachings. Usually Millman gives just enough drama to carry the teaching. In this book, there is very little teaching.I think a lot of people would enjoy this book. I don't seek out entertainment fiction or fiction that includes what I feel is gratuitous violence inflicted upon women and children. I understand Millman's purpose for these scenes and I understand that extreme violence and rape are part of history, but these topics are well covered in the real world for me and I don't care to find them in the books I pick up for the purpose of learning."
5,An enjoyable novel,"""The Journeys of Socrates"" by Dan MillmanA wonderful novel, with a fascinating story, and interesting characters. I never wanted to put it down, always wanting to know what would happen next.Although written after ""The Way of the Peaceful Warrior"" and ""Sacred Journey of the Peaceful Warrior"", this book is really a prequel to both. It is also a completely different type of books than either of is predecessors. The first two books were both weak on story, and loaded on philosophy and spirituality. This book is just the opposite, a masterful story, and very light on philosophy. The philosophy is there, but is an unobtrusive underlying element.This is book to read for it's pure entertainment value, but not so much for enlightenment or inspiration.Entertainment: 5 starsEnlightenment: 3 starsOverall: 5 stars"
2,More like a fantasy novel,"Though well written and interesting in some ways, this books relies too much on unlikely coincidences and the mystical or superhuman capabilities of its characters. Also, too many of the plot twists are telegraphed to the reader in advance, and in a fashion that is really too obvious."
1,Please be serious!,"Disclaimer: I have not read this. However, I don't need to. Just look at all of the high-rise public housing projects that used this book as a blueprint and how they have fared (hint: disastrously) to understand the success of the opinions within. He had absolutely no understanding about what makes cities work because he had very little understanding of humans. His mission was to exalt the machine...period. Plain and simple the guy was a kook, whose passionate prose was tragically interpreted as genius, much to the detriment of humanity. Save your time and money and stay away from this guy. His influence will continue to diminish. Only read if you want to pinpoint the inspiration behind virtually all that's bad about the built environment in your area."
1,Another copy with 2 copies of disc 2!,"I received this about a week ago and gave it to my fiancée for her birthday gift. Well, we opened it up and started going through it and noticed that we got disc 1, disc 2, and another copy of disc 2! I just submitted a replacement request, and hopefully the replacement copy will not have the same issue. Come on Amazon, make it right! (Though I blame the crappy quality control of the manufacturer more than Amazon!)I will update my rating if/when this gets resolved..."
2,Three bottles damaged out of six,"I have used about half of a bottle since I've received the detergent and it seems fine. I don't have any complaints, so far, on the quality of the product but the shipping leaves something to be desired. I discovered today that three of the bottles out of the six were damaged and leaking detergent all over the closet. I wouldn't recommend buying these online and having them shipped."
1,LEAKS!!!!,"First off--I want to make it clear that I think this is a 5 star product which I highly recommend. I gave a 1 star rating because I want to warn others not to purchase this item through amazon. I saw that others had received damaged shipments of leaking bottles but I ordered this product anyway hoping that the problem had been resolved. The shipment arrived in two boxes--one smaller box surrounded by packing materials placed in a larger box. Despite this excessive packaging, one of the bottles was split right down the middle. I didn't notice the problem initially, only today when I went to get a new bottle did I notice that the bottle had leaked all over my cabinet. Trust me, whatever you save purchasing in bulk through amazon is not worth the hassle of cleaning up a huge mess and then having to deal with amazon to try to get some sort of compensation for the defective merchandise."
4,Good product,"I did not have the leaky problems during shipping that others complained about. So far I like the detergent. I have been combining it with white vinegar to remove chemicals. This way, it seems to have more foam, so I always double rinse."
1,Not suggested!,"This is a great product with awful packaging. I ordered the six pack twice and twice it arrived with broken plastic bottles and detergent all over the place. I went to the Seventh Generation website and left feedback with no response. So, get this product because it is great, but buy it in the store."
2,Earth-friendly but poor detergent,"I cannot address the value of buying products from this manufacturer; that's for you to decide.However, this product performs noticably worse than its earth-unfriendly alternatives. Clothes come out greyish and stains are not as well removed as with Tide, the other one I use.But the decision is yours."
1,Not Color Fast -- Bleaches color from clothing,"I have tried both the powder and liquid Seventh Generation Laundry detergents. Both have bleached color out of clothing items. The first time the company reimbursed me for the cost of the clothes, and told me they were removing the words ""color fast"" from the product labels (they did). Now that it has happened again I will not be using this product in the future."
3,Use regular Seventh Generation detergent - better job for less,Since my twins were born I've used just the same detergent for us and for the babies - works fine!!!
2,This is not a High Efficiency (HE) detergent,"If you have a high efficiency (HE) washing machine, this product is not for you. I didn't realize there was a non-he detergent available, as it is not listed on the seventh generation website. Will have to return."
2,"clothes smell clean, but are dingy and faded","I bout this at a store, trying to be more eco-friendly and it was a bit cheaper. My main concern was will it even clean the clothes. They came out seeming clean and fresh, but I felt like the whites and things with white on them got even MORE dingy in the wash, and the black and brightly colored things came out sort of looking faded and dull. They only had a big bottle where I bought it, but I'm going to take it back because I don't want to dingify any more of my clothes."
4,Excellent,We need a biodegradable detergent because we have a new septic system. I wanted to still keep my baby's clothes soft for his sensitive skin and found this online. It softens and cleans well. I don't have to worry about any harsh chemicals on my little boy.
3,damaged in shipping,"So far the product works great, however when we received the box 3 out of the six containers were cracked open on bottom and leaking throughout the box."
5,7th Generation Liquid Laundery Detergent,"I appreciate all the comments regarding the shipping. I have used this laundry detergent for about two years. Now I cannot not find it at my local grocery stores, although they are still carrying the dish liquid detergent and the automatic dish detergent. 7th Generation had a really good website, but not I cannot get it to come up. Has anyone else tried this?"
5,"VERY REAL, GOOD READ","THIS BOOK TOUCHED MY HEART. I ENJOYED READING THE ENTIRE BOOK FROM START TO FINISH. LIFE IS SO SHORT, AND I'M GLAD THAT LILLY AND ADAM REALIZED THAT FACT. I ONLY HOPED THAT ELEANOR AND JONATHAN GOT TOGETHER TO ENJOY EACH OTHER, AND SHAYLA HOPEFULLY FOUND SOMEONE TO LOVE AND CHERISH HER. AS FOR LILLY'S HUSBAND MYRON, I'M SURE IN HIS LIFETIME, HE WILL REAP WHAT HE SOAR... IN LIFE ""FAITH"" MAY BE ALL WE HAVE TO LIVE FOR, SO I GUESS THAT OLD SAYING ""LET GO AND LET GOD"" IS TRUE... I BOW TO YOU MS. FRANCIS FOR WRITING SUCH AN TOUCHING STORY AND FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, LIVING PART OF IT. MAY GOD CONTINUE TO BLESS AND HEAL YOU SO THAT YOU CAN CONTINUE TO ENTERTAIN US WITH YOU WRITING."
4,Lovely Story!,"After having such a hard time finding this book, I knew that it would be good. And I was right. This story was an excellent love story because of Adam's blindness he fell in love with the person and not her looks. Both Lily and Adam had to over come lifes road bumps to heal one another.The secondary characters really helped to make the story a fast-paced enjoyable read. There were some unanswered questions with Adam's sister Kristen and I think we may see a story on her in the future.Good job Francis. Thanks for a great story and I can't wait for you to continue with the T/F/G books and more mainstream novels."
3,A turning point for me,While I debated long and hard about posting this review I went against my better judgement and decide to post on it.I am a big fan of Francis Ray and I love her so I would in know way want to hurt her with my review.I am disappointed that I fell off the wagon with this one. How is it 7 people in a bclub rate The Turning Point with 4*and 4.5* and I only rate it with 3* ? I really enjoyed Johnathan and Eleanor story as well as the misgiving of Kristan and Eric. I guess I have been reading to many mainstream but this is a mainstream. I can't figure this one out . Luv ya Francis and I will continue to buy what you write .
4,Worth the Wait!!!,"This lamp has been on back order for months...I almost gave up!!! When it finally became available, I was so thrilled with it! Im glad I waited! ( the truth is, I didnt wait, I just couldnt find anything similar) It is very durable and a lot bigger then I expected, which is fine. It may not look like much, but this lamp was exactly what I needed to match my sons room. And the quality , is worth the $50."
5,Great Cookbook,"Love this cookbook. Got it as a gift years ago and use it all the time. Now I keep giving it as wedding, housewarming etc. Always have an extra new one on hand."
1,Don't bother,"Believe it or not, my Thomas-obsessed grandson was glassy eyed over this one. A total waste of time and money. Once past the lengthy sales pitch for all things Thomas, it becomes clear early on that the story will be constantly interrupted by a human stationmaster or something, with a story line going that is of absolutely no interest when the child just wants Thomas and his train friends. I'm sorry I bought it and have found many other Thomas cd's which my grandson loves at the library."
5,amazing new Thomas adventure,"I am always pleased when Thomas goes on a new adventure, my son loves Thomas and has since he was two years old, he is now 11 years old and he still watches all the videos and he comes on Amazon to look for new releases and lets me know so we can order them together, i know some of you are probably saying he is a bit old for Thomas, my son has Autism, but i think young and old love Thomas!"
4,Thomas : wobbly wheels and Whistles,"The DVD of Thomas : Wobbly wheels & Whistles, arrived on time and in excellent condition. This will be a great addition to the collection of DVDs for my Grand Daughter, who is a big fan of thomas the Train engine."
5,A terrific account of the first year of the World War,"This book (along with all of her other works) was an excellent telling of the first days of the war in 1914. She details the British rush to go to France and bayonet the ""Hun"" and save Belgian babies.Told with a historian's eye for detail and with the priceless words from the men that fought in the terrible war fill the pages with amazing courage, endurance and hardship.Plenty of great maps allow the reader to follow the advance, then retreat of the British forces and their harrowing withdrawl under savage German pursuit.This book is available from AmazonUK.com and well worth reading if you are interested in this period.Enjoy"
4,voices from a century ago tell you what they saw,"McDonald's books are excellent. It is sometimes hard to follow the big picture of a battle from how she writes, so these books are not for people looking to start learning about the war. But if you already know the basics of what happened in places like Mons, Ypres, Somme then her books are wonderful. All too often people think of WW1 and imaging only men sitting in muddy trenches and dying under mahcine guns and gas while Red Triplanes fly over head. McDonald goes in very close to the story having interviewed veterans while they were still with us and her books recount the adventures of men on guard duty, or in transit, in the dreaded 'glass house' or moving forward with the line.Reading her books you won't get the grand view of the battle field. You will get the memories of men who saw their little piece of it and tells you what they went through."
2,These are NOT San Miguel de Allende shoes,"I really like San Miguel de Allende shoes but the store near me that used to carry them doesn't anymore. The SMDA website has been down as well. Googling brought up these Vivanz shoes which looked similar and were priced similarly at their regular price. They also come up in a search for SMDA shoes. Well, they are not SMDA shoes. These are not nearly as well made, the soles are stiff and uncomfortable and they are not easy to walk in. Big disappointment."
5,Proves Harry Anslinger a liar......,"This was a desk reference for physicians when it was printed in 1899, indicating the various uses of the medicines of the day. Listed as Merck's 1899 Manual of the Materia Medica, Together with a Summary of Therapeutic Indications and a Classification of Medicaments, the volume lists all the various illnesses and medical problems that they felt could be helped by cannibis. The cannabis is listed as Cannabine Tannat Merck, and also listed is Cannabis Indica.What is important about this book is that it was LEGALLY on the physicians desk, and the nation survived. Think about it. Harry Anslinger single-handedly outlawed a useful medicine in this country for nearly 75 years now. It's time to legalize marijuana across this country!!!"
3,not sure,never used it...some goof at the range thought a pistol grip was to rough...ive used pistol grips and liked this better without the finger grooves......but sold it [economy]never shot it..xcellent fit for the defender 1200 i stuck foam in the center because its hollow...thats a minus..but it fits nice as it said it would.
4,Memories of a kid,"I remember reading this as a kid whenever we visited my Grandmother's house. I think I read it each and every time, and enjoyed it each and every time.It's a story of Mr. Fliberty-Jib, who can't stand noises. I think kids can identify with that a it, because they're constantly told to ""keep it down"".This is one book I would like to find and purchase just to have on the shelf as a memory of my younger days."
5,Best city maps,"I use Streetwise maps every time I travel to a city. They are easy to read, fit in a bag, and never rip."
5,Worth every penny!,This map made traveling around New Orleans easy and less stressful. It even helped us with the streetcar routes and stops.
4,Streetwise New Orleans Map - laminated,"A nifty little map/guide that hilites important places, is easy to read and carry with you. Will take a physical beating as well. Good purchase."
3,A good book for a serioud reader-Has a lot info in it,"This book is only for a serioud reader. Can be used as a reference for a compiler designer, a machine designer. But The book is not well organized in its contents. So give special care while reading it. I feel this is a best book for core information.Boby John Anchanattu"
4,Circle of Desire,This book and the other circle novels are well worth reading if you like science fiction and fantasy.
3,"Great Cup, BUT cannot find replacement valves!","I purchased Three 2-packs of this cup, but I cannot find the replacement valves anywhere. The cups are A+, insulated, not cheaply made, but I cannot find the replacement valves! Before you purchase, just make sure the replacement valves ARE available in your local stores. If the valves ARE readily available, I rate this Super! But I cannot find them anywhere, including the stores that continue to sell them! Without the replacement valves sold, it is a poor buy!"
3,the straw gets moldy,"I purchased the spongebob squarepants version of this cup. I loved it at first. But then I had to use pipe cleaners to clean out the straw portion. It was very disgusting. It could have been because I had milk in it. Anyway, I happen to take the flip off, and it was moldy inside. So beware, upon initial appearance it looks clean, but you have to take the straw out and the flip top thing, to see if it's REALLY clean.I would recommend Playtex Insulator Sport Cup over this."
3,A true story about finding a priceless tresure and the costs of keeping it. Enough twists to keep you guessing. I say C,Based on a true story about a group of WWII US army officers who take a treasure of priceless gems from a castle in Germany and there plans to get rich from it. After the fall of Nazi Germany Colonel Jack Durant (Zane) is assigned to a castle formerly belonging to the Hessen family. After stumbling onto the German crown jewels he and 3 others try to find a way to get them back to the US. This movie was pretty much what I expected. Though it is a movie movie it had the look and feel of a TV movie from a cable channel. Nothing special but fairly entertaining. The movie is full of double crosses and them playing one off of another keeps you guessing who is being honest and who is only in it for themselves. A fairly slow moving movie but interesting enough to keep you watching till the end.I give it a C.
5,Conscious Finance,"As a financial planner, I found Conscious Finance to be well-organized and clear in its concepts. Additionally, the personal stories shared by the authors help solidify the very important concepts discussed in this book. Kahler and Fox have done an exceptional job of communicating difficult, often fuzzy ideas in a clear, practical way."
2,Not for the financially astute,"While there are some interesting aspects to this book, it really only makes sense for the financially challenged reader. If you already have and follow a budget, save monthly, live well within your means, know what insurance you need and don't need, and invest for the long term in diversified and low cost index funds then you won't get much from this book. The personal finance portion is little more than Personal Finance 101. I have no doubt the book would be useful for people who are struggling to earn, save and invest but not for those with even a modest level of personal finance acumen."
3,good,I did learn something about the book but it did not fully meet my expectations since they included some concept on money management like investing and different types of insurance. I was hoping to learn more about my hidden beliefs in a deeper way with probably more exercises and examples. The exercises they had here were exercises I did in some books already - nothing new.
4,Scion TC 2012,"Looks great, feels really high quality and the instillation process was pretty smooth.The brake pedal fits like a dream but the gas pedal had to be placed higher than I wanted so the metal bands would have something to hold on to.Car I drive is a Scion TC 2012"
5,"Pricey, but worth every dime.","Classic, pricey, but is a joy to watch wholesome, clean, shows! Nothing is ever on all the 80 channels we own on our cable, so it's nice to watch the Waltons."
1,Mexico finger prints and scratches,"I love the Waltons, but the dvds I got came from Mexico and had finger prints and scratches on them. I had to return all of them for refund."
1,A Painful Lie.,"We purchased the entire Walton's series for our daughter who is hearing impaired. The Jacket of each season's video shows the Universay Symbol for Closed Captioned for the Hearing Imparied (CC). There is a major problem in that none of the ones we have palyed so far, is closed captioned. The irony of this is that the first program is about a deaf girl!What a cruel misrepresentation! Warner Brothers has had closed captioned segments appearing on television, that is what prompted us to buy the series. Does anyone in this industry have a conscience?"
3,good but damaged,My family enjoyed watching the Waltons but a couple of the cases were quite damaged. Also we discoveredfinger prints and some scratches on the season nine Dvds. I would have gone with another company if I wouldhave known the condition of the product.
3,A little sad :-(,"Was really excited to get this series as a Christmas gift. Opened up the first season and the first disk was missing. To get a replacement, I have to send the entire nine season series back which I'm reluctant to do because they are out of stock. Wish there was a way to resolve it some other way."
5,No Better Series!,"The Waltons: The Complete Seasons 1-9. Great product from a great seller (Lee's Movies). Started thinking about buying this series a year or more ago. I am glad I finally did.Video is good (I do not have Hi Def) as is the audio.DVDs are in original packaging. There is inconsistency in the packaging over the 9 seasons, but I see no problem. Some open up book-style, some have separate cases, and some have multi-disk holders within each case.I have no complaints about this product. I just wish there were more than 9 seasons!"
5,panasonic kxtga290b,"had no problems with this device, this is the second phone on our home system.the phone performs as stated. incorporated into our home phone system, by putting on the base, and after 2 min, picking the hand set up and it was intergrated to our system"
1,Not Exactly,Incorrect description of item. This is not the main phone. It is a secondary phone to the main unit.
4,Great energy.,"I really like this dvd. Sharon Mann is always really enthusiastic, and makes you feel like you are a superstar even if you are having trouble with the moves. I love the yoga portion of the video for relaxing & stretching my body, and the pilates portion has some great ab exercises that make me feel like I'm actually working out my muscles. Actually, I've used this dvd so often that it's completely scratched, & I'll probably have to buy a new one pretty soon!"
3,It is ok,"Not as good as volumes 1-3 Way different. Different story line, characters, and over all animation look. Not terrible though!"
3,"Show isn't bad, but the resolution is dismal.","I bought Mean Seasons, Night of Ninja, and Day of the Samurai. The stories are okay, but the native resolution could barely fit an iPod video screen (although I don't think it can be played on an iPod) and is barely watchable on much larger screens."
4,"Good, but could be better","This volume isn't as good as the first three, but at least it ends the original series. There are a few changes that I can't really say I like.The graphics are considerably different, they seem to be cheaper. The original Robin is a new hero, but there is still a Robin who fights alongside Batman. Bottom line, it's not all that bad."
3,ALMOST A CLASSIC,"THESE DID COME ON TWO YRS AFTER THE ORIGINALS WITH SUPERMAN CROSSOVER PAVING THE WAY FOR THE JUSTICE LEAGUE. THESE EPISODES ARE GOOD BUT THEY COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER. STORYLINES ARE GOOD BUT NOT TO MUCH IN DEPTH WE DO SEE THE TIM DRAKE ""ROBIN"" IN THIS ONE THOUGH WHICH IS A COOL TRANSITION AND THE ROBIN THAT IN THE TEEN TITANS IS ""DICK GRAYSON"" VERISON SO I LIKE THE REVAMP AND THE STORY TRANSITION THEY TOOK IT INTO."
1,Worst Batman Animation EVER,"I owned the first 3 volumes of Batman The Animated Series (BTAS) and those were the one's I remembered and treasured from when I was in elementary school. Unfortunately, I went against my own gut-feeling about purchasing this one so I went ahead and bought it and I feel like putting it on craigslist in the 'free stuff' section because Volume 4 is a disgrace to the BTAS cartoon franchise since there were significant changes in animation of the characters, voices and character development. Night Wing? The new Robin is really a kid when he starts crime fighting? Danny Elfman still got to compose his music and that was the only positive element of this cartoon. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM ANYWHERE! Sorry Amazon, but I got screwed over with a set of DVDs I have yet to watch in it's entirety due to the significant difference between the 4th volume and the first 3."
2,NO WHERE NEAR AS GOOD AS vols 1-3,"I CANNOT STAND THE ANIMATION, IT TOTALY STINKS!! I CAN'T STAND HOW THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE THING, THERE IS REPEATEDLY SAID BY THE CHARACTERS, ""OH MY GOD"". THAT WAS THE WORST OF IT. THIS SPOILED THE SERIES!!!!! THIS VOLUME IS JUST TERRIBLE!!!!! VOLUMES 1-3 ARE THE ONLY ONES WORTH BUYING!!!!"
1,PEOPLE WHO CANT DRAW,IVE SEEN DRAWING BY MONKEYS THAT HAD MORE DEPTH. WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE DAYS OF REAL ANIMATION LIKE WICKED CITY GHOST IN THE SHELL 8MAN. HELL EVEN LOONEY TOONS .WHATS WITH ALL THIS SAMURI JACK STYLE????? IF YOU CANT DRAW SEMI PHOTO REALISIM THAN DONT BOTHER BECOMING AN ANIMATOR DO THE WORLD A FAVOR AND BECOME A PASTERY CHEF LIKE YOUR ANCESTORS.
2,Worst of the volumes,"At first, I didn't like the 'Beyond' style used for the classic Batman series. For Batman Beyond, it works, but not for this. Many of the episodes have really lame plots such as 'Holiday Knights' and 'Legends of the Dark Knight,' but what really makes this volume bad is that Batman is more ruthless and much too dramatic for the series, and the Joker beats Harley Quinn much more and much worse than in the previous sets. In volumes 1-3, it was done in comedy, in volume 4, it's done in anger and is way more domestic violence than I'd like it to be. Another problem with this set is that it just jumps straight in with a new Robin in the first episode, with no explanation until the second, and the rest of the story later on.However, I must say that I love one of the new villians - the Creeper. He's hilarious! Overall, I wouldn't recommend this for any price above $20.00. It's just not worth it."
1,New To Batman The Animated Series,"I just learned of Batman The Animated series in 2007 and rented the first two volumes through Netflix. They were so good I bought volumes three and four from Amazon. I was terribly disappointed in volume four, because the animation is no where near the quality of the first three volumes, so visually it is not as good. Gone are the shading, shadowing and face definition that made the first three volumes so pretty and compelling to look at. The new format of telling a story fastpaced in 15 minutes takes some getting use to, however would have been ok had the visuals not been compromised. The new Robin is a child and the idea of a child being able to be effective after seeing the young man Robin, took a leap of faith. The one good thing about this set is that the voices remained the same. Unfortunately, I could not get past the third show in this volume and cannot recommend this set."
1,What the hell,I dont get why they changed the animation for the final season. It was great before. In the more recent ones they made the animation all bright and crappy looking. I dont get how crappy animation some how became in??? cuz its all i see. I love batman.Huge fan. but these episodes were hard for me to watch
4,BTAS vol.4,"the day when the light shines,december 4th.i hpoe amazon.com will give christmas discounts on this dvd cause it would be cool"
3,A downhill slump,"While still largely enjoyable, and even occasionally extraordinary, the fourth volume simple cannot compare on nearly any level to the previous three, leaving a largely disappointed audience.The more angular character designs range from interesting (scarecrow) to just kind of annoying (the Joker) and sadly most of it falls into the latter category, since Batman: The Animated Series was already pretty stylized to begin with."
5,"Dare I say it, the best out of the 4 volumes?","I don't know why I held off buying this for so long. This was my favorite show when I was a kid and it is even better than I remember it. But is it really a kid's show? I loved it when I was a kid, but it is so dark. In one episode Batman tries to kill a man and Robin (the new Robin) has to stop him. Not only is it a very dark show, but the jokes are very funny. And there are plenty of dark jokes mixed in. Every single episode is great. The IRS is after Joker, they go over Tim Drake's (the new Robin's) past, Scarface makes a welcome return, it is all just so good! It took me awhile to watch all 24 episodes, because I am so sad to see this show end. Whether you are young or old, this is sure to please just about everyone looking to see a good TV show.Special features include 3 commentaries."
3,Average at best!,I brought the batman series in order and the 4th season is pretty average. No riddler episodes was a big letdown as he was one of my favourites characters.The episodes also have this annoying red sky in the background all the time which is wierd. I don't know why they changed so much for this season but it wasn't for the good no wonder it got cancelled. Oh and the dvd extras were abysmall to say the least.
4,Best Batman ever,"There have been many animated series featuring the caped crusader. Thisby far , in my opinion, is the greatest to date. The stories are well crafted,holding both my attention and the kids. Some episodes are better than manyof the movies. This is a must for any who love Batman but don'tlike what has been done to characters of the new series."
2,Only For Die-Hard Batman Fans,"Otherwise, Seasons 1 - 3 are the ones for you if you want expert animation and great story-writing. Volume 4's animation was nearly childlike, almost amateur... lazy may be the best word for it. Also, most of the stories were weakly written, almost like ""filler"" material. This only for the most die-hard Batman fans IMO."
3,I agree with some of these Amazon reviews here.,"I agree with some of these Amazon reviews here. The Batman: Animated Series: Volume 4 is not as great as the first three seasons of the series. For some reason, they changed the animation. It's similar to the Bruce Timm's original design of Batman style but it's not the same. I will recommended it but only because the episodes are still good. Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing in this season. Tim Drake is Robin and Batgirl joins the Batman's team. the writing in the episodes are good. but the animation kind of sucks. C"
5,Best season of Batman,"If you are only getting ONE season this is the one to get. Batman had run its course and they started working on the Superman Animated Series. The creators were asked to do one more year of Batman since it was so popular. It allowed them to go back and revamp the character styles and 90% of the villians are much better including an amazing Scarecrow! Only Harley is unchanged and you see her origin along with lots of other Harley episodes. This season has the origin of Tim Drake as Robin since Dick Grayson moved on to be Nightwing and ALOT of Batgirl. It has most of my favorite episodes on it including aptly titled ""Over the Edge"". Not only is the season great but it has the best extra feature of any set: ""Interactive Arkham"" where they talk about all the villians."
5,Can't put it down,It takes me two evenings to read this magazine cover to cover! It is full of very interesting information.
3,Good Magazine but keep missing issues,I subscribed for this magazine September 2011. It's now June 2012 and I have only received 3 issues. I have contacted them several times and am still waiting. It's a good magazine- but it's worthless if I never get them.
4,kindle edition?,I like this magazine but was disappointed to not see it offered for kindle. are there plans to offer it digitally any time soon?
5,disgusted with company,"I ordered first on amazon and have not received a copy as of this date, very disgusted as I could have bought it in stores before this, vietta hawkins"
1,First,I ordered this magazine on line and I was supposed to get the first issue in October. It has been out in stores for at least a week and I still have not received it. The idea is to get the magazine before it shows up in stores. Not happy.
3,IMPOSSIBLE WEIGHT LOSS CLAIMS,"I really enjoy this magazine. As others have mentioned, it is full of great tips, recipes, and other info. However, almost every issue's cover page advertises a program inside that is designed to help readers lose an unrealistic amount of weight within an impossibly short time frame...""9 lbs. this week"" or ""20 lbs. every week,"" etc. I don't know how they get away with this. They have found a way to ""work the numbers"" to come up with these statements, I guess."
5,First for Women Monthly Magazine,First for Women is one of the best monthly women's magazines on the market. I thoroughly enjoy each and every article it addresses each month whereas most montly magazines only have a few articles of interest. A top women's magazine.
3,"First magazine, no kindle access yet.","I love this magazine, but I would like to see it available on my kindle fire soon! I would like to see more magazine on kindle fire."
2,magazine,"cannot review, have not received the first magazine and from what was sent it will be Feb 2012 at the earliestFirst For Women"
3,First for Women,"Haven't recieved the magazine yet... cannot review it.I rated ""IT'S OK"" just because I haven't got it yet."
5,Latest Diet,"I've heard so many good things about the new diet (""Flush the Fat""?). You're supposed to lose 8 pounds a week (and it's a 3-week program). My teacher is on it, and has lost a pound a day! She also says that she is extremely full when she goes to bed, and almost wishes she could eat less. Could someone send me a copy of this diet and food lists? If I have success, I'll post it here and recommend it further. But from what I've seen it is fantastic!email: dark_goddess_bell@hotmail.com"
4,Grandmother adores!,"Got this gift subscription for my husband's grandmother and she dores it! She enjoys the funny stories and health tips in them very much. And I admit, I have read a few of the health articles myself!"
5,Moko : The Art & History of Maori Tattooing,"At last a book that shows the art of Maori tatooing in its full glory.Fantastic pictures of original Maori body art make this a ""must-buy"" for anyone interested in tattooing or the study of ancient cultures.Truly awesome."
2,A Waste,There is nothing to this book. A sentence or two on each page. More like a booklet than a book.
3,Some right-on-target thoughts,The book is worth reading. Many of the observations are Dave Barry insightful. Then there are some fillers.The problem is that most of Dave's best works requires you to go from the perfectly obvious to the unbelievable and believe it. This takes time and skill. This is what the book lacks.
3,"""The Greatest Invention in the History of Mankind is Beer""","I read this book after reading another of Dave Berry's hoping it would be better. Well, it was not. For one thing, it is very short and only one passage per page. This is the same as some of his others. I would only remcomend it to someone with nothing else to do.For a more indepth review, see my other Dave Berry review, the books are very similar, so are my thought on his two books.Have a good one.Ryan"
3,"good, but not as described","The book is in good form, but the description said clean pages, no marks. So that is what I expected but there is a lot of writing in the book, which can sometimes be distracting. Overall though, in good shape."
2,Not impressed,"I was not impressed with the air flow output. I was looking for more bang for the buck. If you you do not need high cooling just mild air circulation then fine, just did not serve my needs. Note the fans are small size."
1,Does not cool anything down!!,"Do not buy this fan if you are trying to make a room cooler in your home. I bought this and returned it after 2 days as all it did was make my apartment hotter!!It sounded good, dual action, high velocity, I figured it had to help a little bit. Boy, was I wrong!! If this fan is high velocity, I would hate to see their fans with low velocity!! All it did was circulate the hot air in the apartment and somehow make it hotter.I would not recommend this fan for purposes of cooling down a room at all!!"
5,Practical and sexy!,"Whether your going for an erotic theme or just practical use, this is a very good garter belt for either purpose. I personally bought one to hold up my thigh-high stockings to complement my interview outfits. But the ensemble looks quite sexy too!"
4,Nice but not for thick socks,I bought this garter belt hoping it would hold up my thigh high socks unfortunately it does not do the job the clips are far to flimsy for them however it does work well with shear stockings and is very comfortable
3,Garterbelt back veiw not available,"I was dissapointed in the fact that there was no back veiw of this product showing the split in the material. I thought it was the front thickness all the way around, but its not. I'm still going to use it nonetheless, but better advertisement would be advised."
1,boo,"I've had this product for almost a year and I keep using it because I'm cheap, but it really doesn't work. The scale is consistent only if I put my feet in the exact same position and stand the exact same way every time. I even have to keep my arms in the same place every time to keep it from changing the reading. If I haphazardly step on and off, the reading can change by up to 5 pounds! What good is the tenth of a pound reading when it's five pounds off? Even with all that effort it is still only a consistent weight, not an accurate one. I have weighed myself all over town to compare and the Omron is always off. As far as the body fat monitor, I am 5'3"" and weigh 128 pounds and it often tells me that I am 32% body fat, which would make me obese. I'd have to be a skin bag of blubber with no bones or organs to be 32% fat at my height and weight. I'm pretty disappointed after having read so many good reviews before I bought it."
3,"So far, so good","I do find this product useful for keeping track of weight and BMI - however, I feel that the body fat percentage is way off. Maybe it is right, and I am just skeptical it could be as high as it is reading, but somehow I doubt it. I will get it checked next time I am at the Dr's for sure!Other than that, this scale works great, is stylish in the bathroom, and was a good purchase for me."
4,great monitor,Very useful in helping me to not only monitor weight loss but to see how muscle mass is increasing.
5,Easy and accurate,This scale has been working very well. Seems to be accurate and it certainly was easy to set up and use each day...even if I hate looking at the results!
1,Just plain terrible,"This product looks nice, the regualr scale works fine, but the Body fat calculations are way way off. I get my body fat mesured at my gym also and the number is a very accurate and consistant with different machines, i vary from 8-11 % . On this machine i was reading from 26%-46% which is just silly considering. My 105lb girlfriend came up at 45%, and a workout partner of mine mesured in at 35% when his body fat is always around 12%. Then when i try to return it they tell me they wont take it back....even though its in the same condition i got it in....Terrible product, and even worse customer service!"
1,Bad Product - Stay Away,"I purchased this product thinking that it will be better than the hand held models or the scale type models, since it combines measurements from hands and feet for a more accurate measurement of body fat. The scale part works normal, but the Body Fat measurement is higher by 20 - 30%, compared to Tanita BC554 scale or Omron HBF-306C hand held. Omron, replaced the unit, but the new one is also inaccurate. Now, I'm tying to get my money refunded, but Omron does not want to take the unit back."
1,Sounds good but don't waste your money,I purchased this scale because I have a water retention problem and I thought this scale would help me control it. However while I could get weighed on this scale I was unable to obtain any of the other information. The instructions were unclear but even trying to use it several different ways it didn't work.
1,Weight off by 8 lbs,"This scale is consistent... consistently low by 8 lbs, at least the one that we got. I happened to go to the doctor the same day the scale arrived and was surprised by the low score. That plus the comparison to our old digital scale and an old mechanical scale; which gave a comparable weight to each other but not this one.We had it on a flat level surface. Also tried taking the battery out for a few minutes and putting it back in.Pretty disappointed, because it was so highly reviewed. I guess we just ended up with the short end of the stick on this one.The ""feel"" of the scale standing on it was pretty nice, nice and firm."
2,Difficult to use for a hasty person,I sent this product to my friend as a Christmas present. She hasn't been able to figure out how to use it yet for three weeks. It's a little too difficult for a hasty person.
2,Very Inaccurate Fat & BMI Readings,"I found that the scale's weight function was accurate, but the fat and bmi features were very inaccurate. This scale showed my fat & bmi at more than twice what other scales and test results have shown."
2,very inaccurate fat monitor,"the fat monitor on this scale is awful.We bought this earlier this year as part of a get in shape resolution. Both spouse and I weight lift-me mostly for toning, but he has big muscles.I just had my body fat caliper tested at the local university, and have also used 2 different measuring methods. I come in at 22% (41 y.o female)in all methods. the Omron has me at 33.9 %. lol. I wear a size 2-3 in pants. My husband is 49 y.o and is 16% body fat but Omron has him at 37% which I believe is obese. We are both in the ""fitness"" range for our gender and age, so this thing is a joke.The scale part is/was accurate. I have crossed checked it with doctor scales. However recently it has been less so. you can get on 3x in a row and get different weights. I am hoping it is just the battery..."
5,Love the Scale,"Bought this scale on the recommendation of a friend. It was easy to set up and is easy to use. I love that it measures weight in .2 intervals, so it is easy to see weight loss progress (or lack thereof). Highly recommend this. I also use the Omron pedometer and Omron heart rate monitor, and have been equally pleased with these products."
2,It doesn't work,"The scale part works fine, but the fat % measurement does not work. If you care about fat%, I'd recommend using the hand held device instead. It gives more accurate reads."
3,"Great product, but shorter than expected life.","I loved this scale for the 2 years I owned it, but the display went on it recently and I had to get rid of it since I couldn't read my weight. The weight readings were pretty accurate though."
4,Works Great!!,"At first, I didn't like it because to get all your correct measurements you have to stand on the scale with no socks on. But you only have to do that the first time or if you want to know all of your results like body fat etc. If you just want to weigh yourself you can keep you socks on.The only thing that is a little annoying with this scale is that you have to turn it on instead of just stepping on it. It's not a big deal just a little annoying!!"
2,Hum,This worked great when I first got it. Now after I changed the batteries it wont measure BF anymore. And weight isnt consistant either.
4,Good for the money,"This shows your weight accurate (compared it many times to my other scale) as well as right on with the BMI, on the fat percentage, I tried it many times through out the days, the first few days, and, for this to be consistent, you have to check the fat percentage at the same time every day. For me the best time was in the evening, about 3 hours after dinner. This may not be the perfect fat percentage aside from water weighing, but, if you lose fat, you can track your progress."
3,It's ok just a lot more button pushing.,It's a good accurate scale. To get the body fat reading I have to bend down and push the buttons with my fingers. They are not toe accessible LOL. I am 40 lbs over weight so bending isn't a big deal for me. If it is for you and you want the body fat percent reading then this is not the scale for you. It is toe friendly to turn on and weigh. I like the BF% thing. My humble opinion.
1,Worse than useless,This product is a joke. I have to measure 15 or 20 times to get any reading other than weight and an error message (yes I read the instructions and am doing it correctly). Over those 15 or 20 attempts the weight measurement returned varies wildly. You are better off with a $6 old-school scale.
2,"Good scale, junk fat monitor","Scale comes within two pounds of other scales I know to be trustworthy. So far so good.Scale reports my body fat as 17% higher than the caliper test, 14% higher than the navy test, and declares me obese. I'm far, far from obese. I've tried various times of day, before/after eating drinking, read the entire manual, I just can't get a consistent or remotely accurate fat measurement."
2,Would be great - if it worked,"I've only had this scale for less than four months and it has now stopped giving any measurements other than my weight. Now I have to package it up and mail it off to be fixed. I like the idea of this scale, but the reality has been less than stellar."
1,Maybe I got a lemon? HBF-400,Inconsistent readings. Plus or minus up to 2 pounds in successive tests. Not so reliable.
1,Don't buy if you expect to use it for more than two years,"My experience with Omron is similar to other reviewers. I purchased the Omron HBF-400 scales in June, 2009 and by August, 2011, most of the display had stopped functioning, rendering the scale useless."
2,Worked for a while,"The scale worked well for about a year, and then became unreliable.Stepping on and off gave readings of more than 1.5 pounds difference.Tossed it and purchased another brand for far less."
5,"Good Product, Reasonable price","Received my scale on a timely basis about two months ago. Found that it is attractive and functional. Seems to be most accurate bathroom scale I have ever owned. Have tested it against doctor's scales, etc. and it comes through with flying colors. Very pleased - would recommend to others interested in a similar product."
5,Great Scale!,"Works just as advertised! It's great to see your fat% and muscle%, as you can measure what type of weight you are dropping...(ie if you lose weight, but your fat% goes up and your muscle% drops you know you need to start working out more as your body is attacking muscle to preserve it's fat supply. Awesome that it tracks your history over time so you can see your progress. Overall very pleased with scale...seems very accurate (but I have nothing else to measure it against to test this...)"
2,"Liked the scale part, but fat percentage way off.","I purchased this scale to replace a simple scale that reflected a different weight every time I stood on it, sometimes with a difference of more than a pound in a matter of seconds.I did not have that problem with this scale. It is very consistent in weight.However, the fat percentages reported are definitely not accurate. It lists my fat percentage as over 30%, which qualifies me as obese. At 5'4"" and 121 pounds, I am certainly not obese.As some other purchasers mentioned, it is the amount of loss that is important, versus the accuracy of the measurement. But I will have to measure my fat % with calipers or with the help of a professional to find out where I really am on the spectrum. So this part of the scale is really useless for me and I will be returning it. I might as well order a regular scale and calipers."
2,It does not have Kgs,"Although it looks like a solid scale (it is made by Omron, so it should be), it does not have the option for Kgs. Amazon displays this item together with HBF 500 so a lot of comments are addressed towards HBF 500. Thus it was really confusing finding information about the weight units. Also, I think you had to keep pushing the button to turn it on/off, although it could be touch sensitive but i never tried it. I returned it back and bought an Escali scale."
2,Accurate scale....terrible body fat measurement!,"DO NOT buy this scale if you are trying to accurately measure your body fat percentage! I don't know how this scale has managed to recieve such good reviews, it's is horribly inaccurate at measuring anything other than weight. I am a 24 year old ex-college athlete and I exercise/lift weights 7 days a week, yet somehow, according to this scale, I have 27% body fat. I calculated using other methods (tape and calipers) and both reported 9-11%. I only give the scale two stars because it does accurately measure weight. Save your money, buy a less expensive scale and some calipers for a more accurate method of measuring body fat."
2,I almost lost my mind,"I was excited to receive this product because I workout 6 days a week and wanted to first, know what my body fat was, and second, begin to monitor the progress as I lost it. To my surprise, when I stepped on the scale it said that I had 20% body fat! I went into shock because I am only 180lbs and everyone considers me as a health nut who is in extreme shape. I immediately changed my diet and intake of calories which caused my girlfriend to think that I needed medical attention because I am not fat. Two days later I decided to go to a trainer at my gym and asked him to take my body fat measurements. It was 9%!!! I was relieved but upset at the fact that I paid money for a scale that not only was wrong, but was extremely wrong. I give this product two stars because the weight scale is accurate, but I would not recommend this particular scale."
4,Works well,THe scale is a few weeks old. So far it has been working well. There are two of us that use it and we go between settings quite easily.
2,Display went bad,Worked great for about year and half. Then the digital display went bad. Over half of the display components that make up the numbers randomly do not show. Makes the display unreadable. Replacing batteries etc does not help. No help from Omron. Have had other scales for a decade or so in past.
2,Broke,Be careful... I barely ever use this and the LCD died on it so don't expect to get much more than 3 years use out of it
4,Pretty good!,"While a little bulky for a scale, it works great. When I tested it three times in a row, the weight only varied by .2 pounds, which is pretty good compared to my old scale!"
4,"Accurate, Easy to Use","So far, the Omron Body Fat Monitor and Scale has been a wonderful purchase! It appears to be accurate and does not fluctuate from day to day or movement of the scale. My previous scale was very sensitive, such as when it was moved it took 3 to 4 trys of getting on and off and adjusting to zero to get it to weigh accurately. This scale is a great incentive to loose weight!"
2,not pleased,I purchased the Omron HBF-400 after reading several reviews. I am not at all pleased with the purchase. I can never get the same reading twice! Neither does my husband. I would not recommend this product to anyone who is seriously watching their weight.
1,Didnt Work,I got this scale to measure my body fat percentage and it never worked. It gave me the exact same number every time I used it and Ive had it for a couple years now. The scale itself works fine for measuring your weight but body fat calculation is worthless.
5,"looks good, works good","I finally got a scale in the bathroom. My loving bride would not get one - okay, I am not saying she needs one so don't go there. The scale looks nice. The multi person function is great. I can tap the scale with a toe, it turns on, and weight is measured. I didn't use the body mass index. I am pleased with the product."
3,Good while it worked (3.5 years) - I've ordered an EatSmart Precision Scale to replace it,"This was a very nice unit until the LCD stopped working. Maybe I was just unlucky but mine died after 40 months of not very active use.Service politely pointed out that the warranty is only 1 year. They also said""Additionally, your HBF-400 has been out of warranty for such a length of time that there are no longer any parts available for the unit, making service or calibration also unavailable.""I didn't expect it to be worth trying to repair but I am surprised parts or even calibration wouldn't be possible on a unit they are still selling. I assume it is just a customer service brush-off.I've ordered an EatSmart Precision Body Fat Scale to replace it.EatSmart Precision GetFit Digital Body Fat Scale w/ 400 lb. Capacity & Auto Recognition Technology"
4,Good Scale love the readouts,"I like this scale a lot. The weight is right on, the body fat is a little high then what I actually am. Really easy to use and love that it has spots for more then one user. Highly recommend."
4,"Great scale, light weight, accurate measurement","Weight measurement is great, accurate to 0.2lb. It's light to carry. Memory is a great feature. The only things is it tilt and slam back on the ground if I step on the far side of the scale, however the scale work fine after, so it very solid build. Overall this is a great product for $33 I purchased from Amazon on a Friday sale. :>"
3,"Fine for weight, horrible for fat %","The scale seems consistent enough in terms of weight but forget about the fat percentage. It's not even close. It is a decent scale other than that. I would suggest saving the money for a weight only scale, or spend a little more for one with real body fat measuring capabilities."
2,Unreliable,"This scale worked fine until the battery that it came with died (1 year). Then it would not reset with a new battery. The readout numbers were scrambled even after I let it sit without batteries overnight. I read them manual and got the numbers to read out properly only after causing it to have an error message. It works, but you can't read the middle number if it's an 8. We still use it, and it seems accurate when compared to the doctor's office, but like all electronic things...."
1,NO accuracy of weight and not to mention about fat measurement,I m really surprised that even the weight measurement is not accurate at all. For example my weight about 135lbs but was reported as 85 lbs. Not to think about the accuracy of fat measurement..Waste my effort and time to order and return it.
4,Good bang for the buck,"Omron does a good job with this fat monitor + scale. I was used to their fancy model at the gym that printed out the information ($900). This one was more in my price range and it can memorize up to 3 users. Very helpful for comparing pregnancies. Yes, it remembered my weight info from 2 years from and I compared it the second time around. Looks nice in the bathroom/ washroom also"
3,Omron HBF-500 Body Composition Monitor with Scale,"Works great as a scale. The body fat percentage calculations are a bit suspect as they are +/- 19%, on average, higher than two other sources that closely relate to each other."
2,Change User Hard To See,"I found it difficult to change to new user. With my wife and I using this unit we found it hard to change settings. The main difficulty is reading and understanding the setting buttons. You need to bring the unit close to you in order to view and change the buttons. Cannot not see while standing over it, and letters on buttons too small for my eyes. The display number is very large and readable however. Also, be sure you have paper and pencil in hand if you want to log in your numbers to compare with earlier readings."
3,Excellent Weight Scale - Terrible Fat Monitor,"As a weighing scale, this product is excellent. Readings are consistent and accurate. However, as a body fat monitor, it is not great. The body fat readings are way different from the ones done at my gym (using calipers). If you need to monitor body fat in terms of whether you are making progress or not, then buy this scale. But if you are looking for accurate body fat / BMI readings, then this scale is not worth buying."
2,Not happy with complicated operation,"Had the scale for several months; took too long to read the manual to get this thing to operate. Body Fat monitor and memory? now, I just want to get on the scale and tell me. I use my big toe to turn it on and off and no longer try to compute or retrieve data. Waste of my time. If I had a personal trainer to do it; that would be helpful. My husband doesn't believe in scales that have manuals."
2,Poor Choice.,"This scale was recommended for weight loss challenges but in the review, there was nothing clearly stating it only went up to 300lbs! Not a good choice!!!"
2,inconsistant results,I weighed myself a total 20 times and compared my results with my inexpensive taylor. This scale was very inconsistant. They were both side by side on a level floor. I followed directions. The omron only gave me two indentical readings out of 20. The taylor gave me 14 readings that were indentical out of 20. The omron was consistantly inconsistant with every reading.It will not give you a fat percentage unless you input your age and hieght. I find that interesting. I have returned this product.
2,"Didn't Work; Doctors, Please Do Your Job!","I think I may have been lured by the idea of something that claimed to measure both overall weight and BMI, as I tend to have a lot of muscle. Unfortunately, I may have had too much muscle to get an accurate reading. I didn't exactly consider myself ""athletic"" in body type, but I guess I was wrong if I ended up with only a weight measurement after following the instructions as clearly and accurately as i could. I think it might help if there were a more precise description than ""athletic"" for my body type, and to be honest I kind of wish that doctors would shed some light on this rather than judge women based on societal standards. Then maybe fewer women would feel the need to weaken themselves just to get the numbers they want. But then, that's why I bought this thing in the first place."
1,not what is advertised,"I ordered this scale and a scale that measured only up to 330 lbs arrived. I gave it as a gift and re-ordered, only to get the same wrong scale. The item numbers match, but the description is wrong."
2,"Works as a scale, but seems quite inaccurate at a fat % monitor",It seems to give me the same % regardless to the condition I'm in. I don't think it is taking an accurate reading based on anything other than connectivity of my skin and I don't think it is accurately measuring my body fat %.
5,A great investment towards better health,"Arrived within the expected timeframe, well packaged. Works great, very easy to use and the ability to track up to 4 individuals is a great asset."
1,Incomplete description,"The ad for this scale omitted to tell the reader that the scale could not be used by someone who has an implanted Pacemaker or Defibrillator.Thus, we had to return it, using the prepaid label supplied by this company."
2,Scale reading is very confusing,"Other than getting a scale due to the listed recommendations, I am now kind of intimidated by the recent reading when a scale shows more than one person actual weight. The scale gets a little unnerving, so I am probably going to either send it back or donate it to someone else whose weight is a little more revealing. I think digital scales are pretty much inaccurate as the smaller sized scales shown by Amazon.com. I wondered if the scales were purposely manipulated that no matter how much you seem to lose weight, that the scale itself shows quite the opposite. I recommend that you do not buy this product."
4,Good deal for the price,"I haven't used it thoroughly yet. But from what I have seen so far, it is a pretty good scale to track your everyday fat loss progress. I am satisfied with this purchase for the price and quality and ease of use. I use it daily to track my body fat % and weight. So far used it for only myself. Haven't checked it out for more than 1 users."
3,So so item,"This one supposed to be very precisely, but it sometimes give different results for the same person within 1mins (error around 0.6-0.8lb).Another inconvenience point is that it can not take consecutive measurements, you have to turn it off and on again to take the next one.Other parts are fine, but consider the price it's only an average item."
2,Not reliable...,"I read most of the reviews before I purchased this product, and although some of the reviews mentioned getting defective scales that were giving different measurements every time, I went ahead and purchased it because there were lots of great reviews too. Well, looks like I got a defective one...just my luck! Everytime I get on the scale I get a different weight within 4lbs! I got weighed at a doc appt and my weight was nearly 4lbs less than what the Omron scale says. My roomate tried it and said she got a different measurement (by at least 3 pounds) each time she got on as well. So, I'm not really trusting of the body fat or bmi measurement.So far ( I've had the product for two weeks now) I'm not happy with the results and unfortunately will have to go through the trouble of returning it. Ugh!"
1,don't use for tracking body fat--totally inaccurate!,"i got this recently as i've started the four hour body diet and wanted to track my weight/body fat loss. however my body fat reading came in at 36%, which shocked me as i'd guessed it would be about 25%, since the four hour body book has pics of people with their body fat listed. i did some research and found an online body fat calculator which the military developed and is apparently incredibly accurate [...]; you enter height, weight, gender, neck, waist and hip measurement, and that came in at 24.5%. so DO NOT TRUST THE BODY FAT READING OF THIS PRODUCT! omron has a handheld body fat measuring unit which is only about $35 and apparently much more accurate.however from a dieting perspective, i suppose one will be much more inspired to stick to a diet if they think they have that much more body fat than they really do :)"
1,Don't buy this,"The idea of this product seems so good I thought I was getting a great product but I was wrong. I set it up and tried it out and I was a good 10-15 pounds lighter than the scale at the doctors office said only 2 days later. Then to make matters even worse the scale was inconsistent, I dropped 2 pounds every time I stepped on the scale. Do not buy!!!!!!!!!"
2,Body fat % is way off but everything else checks in fine,"Ok, I purchased this product about a year ago and am finally getting around to a review. I can honestly say that the body fat % is a good bit off(about 10% higher on the scale) on this omron product. I've actually gotten measured at my university fitness club(by caliper) and also at my local ymca where they have the fancy machines that measure your body fat percentage; the difference between the fitness club and ymca is marginal, but the omron scale calculates my body fat % much higher(10%). I've tried taking the batteries out for a while so it can reset and still no luck. My wife uses the scale as well and she has the same issue I do. The weight and BMI measure fine as far as I can tell. I guess the silver lining about the Omron product is that for me the numbers were consistent so you could measure how you are doing compared to last week etc. I just wouldn't trust the actual body fat % number that pops up on the display."
2,Not a big fan...,"I've had this for over a year now - I have to say - it's not met up to the expectation I had.From all indications, and I understand the limitations with the technology, the BMI indicator is completely useless if you're above average build.The scale is extremely sensitive to the slightest gradient from a perfect horizontal, so readings vary considerably if I move the scale even a few inches.I wish someone had told me these two things before purchasing.UPDATE: (12/28/2010)Stopped working altogether."
1,Stopped working after 5 months,"The scale was perfectly functional until about 5 months in, I turned it on, and when I stepped on it, nothing happened.I contacted customer service, they suggested a few things (replacing batteries, hard surface, etc) and none of them worked. They wanted me to pay to ship the unit back to them and include $8 for them to assess what's going on. That is 20% of the purchase price, plus another $10 to ship it back to them... instead of dealing with them, I'm just going with a different brand."
3,It helped me loose 25 lbs,"Of course, I can't compare it with the one my nutritionist has, but it did help me track weight, metabolism etc. over a period of one year. I used it on a weekly basis and the results were pretty consistent. Consistence was more important to me than accuracy because I was following trends during my weight loss adventure. But consistency would be gone whenever I moved the scale from it's original place, sometimes even if I just rotated it - it would give slightly different reading.It's finally broken, two years after I bought it, the display does not show all the digits anymore, but I'm not surprised, the wiring in the handle (where the display is) has been under pretty big strain thanks to my regular weekly pulls. But I'm not fat now, so I can handle the handle :)"
3,"Stylish, but not as functional as I'd hoped","This scale looks beautiful, and I think the weight measurement is accurate, but I bought it for the body fat monitor, and that is way off. They do admit in the instruction booklet that the monitor won't be accurate for ""athletes or people with a high percentage of muscle"", but I wish I'd known that before buying. I'm no Olympian, but I work out regularly, and had had my body fat measured on previous occasions as being 21-22%. This scale measures it consistently as 32-33%. I'm assuming the discrepancy is because of my muscle mass, not because the scale itself is malfunctioning, but I'll admit to being lazy enough not to want to return it and find out -- if the next one did the same thing, I would have wasted my time. Anyway, nice features otherwise, and at least I can tell if I'm going up or down! :o)"
4,Has been great for the past 3+ years,"I use this scale somewhat infrequently, perhaps ones every couple weeks. It is still running on its original batteries. I would say it's almost perfect; if only it would keep a log of my previous weights/body fat measurements..."
4,Only displayed in pounds aussie be aware!,"The scale seem to be ok, bf% is inaccurate, only displayed in pounds so if you unfimiliar with pounds then stay away, poiting at ozy. Other then that its working fine as intend."
4,"Easy to use and good function, at least for weight and bmi",The body fat seems to be off (consistently high) but we mainly got it for weight.
2,"Good scale, laughably bad bodyfat numbers","The good- its a nice digital scaleThe bad- the badyfat ratings it gives are absurdly off. Ive had my bodyfat measured multiple ways, and this is off by about 2.5x. Only good as a mean spirited party trick"
5,Omron HBF-400 Body Fat Monitor and Scale,"Love it! I owned a Weight Watcher brand scale before this one that weighed in increments of 2 tenths as well but the darned thing never seemed to weigh you the same weight twice in a row no matter how many times I got on and off within a 5 minute period of time. But this scale is consistant in it's weight-reading and is constructed really well. Although I didn't purchase this scale for the body-fat monitor, it was right-on with where my doctor told me I was. I don't know anything about body-fat monitoring so take my evaluation on that part of the scale for what it's worth - amiture knowledge. I would 100% recommend this scale."
1,Body fat % indicator does not work,"I work out 5-6 days a week, alternating weight training with cardio and would be considered ""athletic."" Got curious about body fat % and bought this scale and was astounded by the high body fat reading it gave me. Decided to buy 4-5 other measurement instruments (manual calipersAccumeasure Fitness 2000 Body Fat Caliper with Fat % Chart, electronic caliperAccu-Measure Fat Trac II Digital Skinfold Caliper, handheldOmron HBF-306C Fat Loss Monitor, etc...) They all measured body weight within 1-2% of each other, and all measured roughly half the % of this scale. It's a good scale, but don't buy it if you're looking for body fat % accuracy."
1,% Body Fat is way off,"% Body Fat is way off on this unit. I measured it using several methods, and it was 15-18%. With the 400, it measures 25%. I'm pretty athletic, so that could be the reason. That's the only reason I bought the freakin thing!"
1,Very disappointed!,"I tried to buy a scale with a body fat monitor that would be accurate. I had just finished six weeks with a dietician and lowered my body fat to 33% so I know what the scale should have read. However, it read 43%! I was extremely disappointed. The weight was also off but I bought the scale for the body fat monitor. I am very disappointed in this product."
1,Inconsistent and inaccurate scale.,"Inaccurate scale. I bought this Omron on March 1 here on Amazon. My scale will read my weight differently by up to 2 pounds, back to back readings (weigh, get off, reweigh). That happens about 50% of the time. The other 50% it stays relatively consistent.Further, I have actually weighed myself, completed 45 minutes of cardio (550 to 580 calories burned), reweighed myself immediately after and gained a pound - almost a half dozen times in 11 days of having the scale. That's phyiscally impossible. When you're trying to lose weight the inaccuracy of this scale is no help. I want to be able to measure the effectiveness of the activities pursued vs what I eat.It's like the scale has two different calibration settings (or zero settings) and randomly selects which one it uses when I turn on the scale. I cannot recommend the Omron HBF-400 - I can't trust what it says."
1,Failed in less than 2 years,"I bought this less than 2 years ago and i thought i was enjoying it until the numbers started to fad away from the display last week. As of now, i cannot even seen one full number anymore!"
5,awesome scales for measuring body fat,"I love these scales! They are accurate, and the readings it gives are very consistent. It only takes a few seconds to get the reading. It looks nice. I couldn't be happier with these scales, highly recommended as a way to track your progress when trying to lower your body fat/weight."
2,Worked well until it died,Will not buy another Omron product again.Not very accurate. Was 4lbs off any medical scale I've tried. I expected this product to be more accurate and last longer than it did. Finally it died after two years.
3,hard to set up,maybe it is bcos i have set up anything. but this was the first instructonal manual i have read so far. it was easy and straght forward.i followed t step by step but maybe it was not enough info for me. i got it in February and can switch it from users and every other thing but this machine says i weigh 45 pounds!!!! i would ever want to weigh that and that is definately not my weight.It has been under my bed and i am very reluctant to reread the instructions.....i wonder why it doesn't give my right weight.is it bcos my feet are longer than the foot pad? i have thought of everything....i hope soeday it works cos i am sure i can't return it now....
5,OMRON fat loss monitor with scale,"Omron HBF-400 Body Fat Monitor and ScaleVery happy with this selection and find it easy to use despite other comments to the contrary. Particularly useful for people on diets and exercise programs, the scale gives very reliable information on body fat,body mass index, and weight within 0.2 lb. It is not necessary to wait for all three readings since weight can be obtained by simply skipping one button push."
5,"Very accurate, very easy to use, stylish design","I love the scales and it is so accurate (on the weight. I do my BMI with calipers so I don't really use that feature at all). Being able to accurately track the weight to a 10th of a pound has really helped keep me on track. So far, I'm down 15 lbs. :yay:"
4,Precise,I really liked the scale. It is precise and also the body fat measurements are really good. I had a body fat measurement made by a physician made a few days ago and the numbers are the same.
4,Easy to understand,This scale was easy to understand and measures the same as my doctors office. Easy to monitor weight and fat.
2,"Accurate Scale, Body Fat Calculator not even close!","The Omron HBF-500 is a very accurate scale, but when it comes to reading body fat it's way off! It has about a 6% deviation from my calipers and the scale at the gym I use. Although, it is consistent, which I can use to see if there any changes, it's completely off.Overall this a fairly easy machine to use. But for me it's just an over priced scale. Not worth the money in my opinion."
4,JUST A DIGITAL SCALE,Works just fine and is accurate as a weight scale. The computations for fat & BMI seem to be a joke and not very meaningful. I would suggest buying something else to do these computations but as a $40 weight scale this unit is very good.
3,"Good scale, not good for body fat","It performs well as a digital scale and seems to be pretty accurate and consistent. I ditched my cheaper digital scale because I could step on 3 times in a row and get 3 readings varying by 5 lbs in either direction. For the price, this scale is worth it just as a solid digital scale.As a body fat calculator, however, it's ridiculously inaccurate and inconsistent. If you want body fat (to measure body fat, that is; not that you actually want more body fat), forget this thing. You'll have to pay more for that if you want it to work, I guess.If you're just looking for a reliable and consistent digital scale, however, I think this one is pretty good."
2,If you're athletic or fit---won't work for you!,"Consistently inaccurate with body fat measurements. The device is sensitive to electrical currents so I made sure not to be around the microwave, etc. But even doing that, I'd still get wacky numbers. Taken a few seconds apart from different locations in my room, I'd get body fat measurements 3-4 percentages off from each other.I'm a very fit and healthy individual. I bought this to keep an eye on my stats. I know how to weigh myself (not after meals, showers, etc.). I also understand that calipers are more accurate, but this scale shouldn't be SO far off--especially for $60+. Booo."
1,Broken from day one.,From day 1 this product never worked properly. The batteries underneath the scale kept on losing connectivity to the coils so I constantly had to reset them in. Almost every time I went on the scale I would need to do this since the scale would lose power as I was weighing my self. VERY ANNOYING!!!
2,Wrong body fat percentages,"this item looks good but it gives the wrong body fat percentage. I recently had a check up and found out that my body fat was 28, this item shows that it is 42....that is a big difference..maybe my own was faulty but you can never tell.."
4,Very nice just need to read the manual first.,This is an excellent scale that reads your body's weight correctly every time you step on it. When I weigh myself I weigh three times to get an average and every time it's the same number. If one reads the manual and knows when to measure weight then they will not be disappointed.
4,A good product,"I bought this weighing scale for my wife really, who was pregnant. I thought that coupling my buy for a weighing scale with a body fat monitor would be a good idea as I exercise a lot and hence needed to know my BMI ratio and Fat percentage. It seems to be pretty accurate in its calculation and also consistent. I find this better than any hand held devices.The option of four personal profiles is a great idea as I don't need to re enter my information and my wife's.All in all a good product"
3,"Great BMI & Weight, not so good with body fat","So I received my scale yesterday. I have a friend who bought another brand for $120+, which I would never pay for a scale. I setup my profile and stepped on the scale. I'm 27 yrs old, weigh 165lbs and I'm in decent shap (run regularly around 10+ miles/week).My friend's scale has two modes for body fat %, an athletic mode and a normal mode (this one only has one). Under athletic, it reads I'm around 16% body fat. Under normal mode, it reads I'm around 19% body fat. This Omron scale says I'm 23% body fat. I'm sorry, but that's borderline OBESE.If you are just looking for a weight & BMI scale, this will do just fine, but if you are buying this for the body fat monitor, skip this model and buy something more accurate."
1,body fat % WAY OFF !,This is a good scale other than the body fat percentage IS way off. I work in a weight loss office and we have a machine that cost thousands of dollars and many hand held units that cost only fifty dollars a piece. Those units (all seven of them) have my body fat at 22%. This machine reads 32%. I also read 22% with the use of calibers. The odds of 8 different methods being incorrect and this machine being right are not good !
1,Athletes do Not Purchase,"Warning to atheletes: This body fat scale does not have the athlete setting. It therefore cannot make the correct assumptions about bone density, etc. to give you an accurate body fat measurement. If you are athletic (10 hours+ of cardio per week and resting heartrate of 60 or less), this scale will not work for you. I bought this scale and it told me my body fat was a full 10% higher than it actually is."
2,Accurate Scale but BLASPHEMOUS Body Fat Calculator,"The Omron HBF-500 is not worth your money. Get a good scale and a separate Omron HANDHELD body weight calculator. I admit, the body weight scale is extremely accurate but the body fat percentage calculator is not. That is why I gave it two stars instead of one star.So far, based on a seven-fold calipher test, the HANDHELD Omron device is really on target (plus or minus a tenth of a percentage). The integrated Tanya body weight and body fat scale reports a 4 percent deviation from the two aforementioned methods. The Omron HBF-500 reports an almost 6 percent deviation from the first two aforementioned method.I have had professional testing for my resting metabolism. For my body, the Omron HBF-500 under reported my resting metabolism by 600 calories.Overall, the only thing that is worth wild about this scale is the body weight scale. Nothing else. The extra gagets are not worth the money when the reports are inaccurate."
3,"Nice, but not for everyone","This attractive ""fat loss monitor"" has an accurate scale and BMI register. I didn't have too much trouble programming it. My weight on it matched up with my weight at the doctor's office within a half-pound. But as other reviewers suggest, the fat monitor element is dicey. My BMI was within the normal range, but my ""fat content"" was almost in the morbidly obese range. You might expect some difference, but that much?? What they don't include in the above product description, but are listed in the manual, are all the conditions that might make the fat monitor part inaccurate, including being post-menopausal, elderly, very muscular, and having osteoporosis. There's a long list of other problematic profiles. So if you're under 50 and not too fit, this product will probably work well for you. For the rest of us, not so much!"
2,Inaccurate for athletes,"I was under the impression I'd be getting a viable means of measuring body fat with this device. I'll be 50 years old at summer's end and have always worked out. When I got my first measurements, I was shocked. The unit indicated I had 25% body fat. Caliper measurements, as well as those calculators wherein you enter height, weight, and a few tape measurements, always indicated results ranging from 12 - 18% body fat. Vanity aside, it is obvious I work out as I have discernable muscularity, including 6-pack abs. Standing 6 feet, weighing 175, and looking like I do, I really wondered if Omron could be accurate. I contacted their support center and was informed that the unit is accurate for 2 out of 3 people and that it wasn't designed for athletes. I'm not sure I understand why that would be so, but that is what they told me. So, if you're already in decent shape, this may not be the product for you."
4,Not bad.,"This scale is easy read to read, simple to use. My only issue is that it has to be turned on before standing on it. The power button is simple enough, just press with your toe. I would prefer to just get on it without having to go through the extra step, no matter how minor. Other than that, it's a great scale."
2,Body Fat Monitor Well Below Average,"This is expensive considering that all you get is a scale. While I can appreciate that perhaps it can show a trend for BMI or Body Fat Monitor, the numbers for those metrics are completely off. It is telling me that I have 28% body fat. Calipers have told me that I am around 12%. Save yourself the hassle and buy another product."
2,Very Inconsistent,"This scale is very inconsistent. I would not purchase it unless you are looking for an ""average"" of your weight over time. I wanted something accurate within .2lbs and that is why I purchased this model. I'm not happy with it at all."
4,Great all-in-one scale,This scale works great. The form factor is good and it quickly makes all measurements. I also like the fact that it keeps 4 different profiles for muliple people. Great scale
2,Too complicated and not consistent.,In the end... this scale tries to be too much... without the needed quality and usability. It should be so much simpler to use. My wife and I tried it and it rarely gave the correct reading. Too often an error would display.In the end... it should just give your weight and %body fat. Not worth the money in my opinion.
2,"Inconsistent, overpriced piece of garbage","Unless my weight is fluctuating 5 lbs every reading (170-175), this scale is defective. Sigh."
4,Also a great Product,"Its a great product to measure your BMI, Bodyfat %, resting metabolism,visceral Fat level.with this you don't have to do lengthy calculation for all the things mnentioned above especially Body Fat % which i found to be one of the most important factor and to complicated to calculate.To put all in one its worth to buy only for Body Fat % and Visceral fat level."
1,Poor scale,"I have two other scales, old big dial scale and a no name brand lcd. Both give the same weight as the pro balance scale at the gym, this scale is 5 lbs over. I took some weighs (20lbs)and put them on all three scales and the omron showed it at 21 lbs, the other at 20 lbs the scale is not worth the money."
1,This is Junk.,"I read the entire book, spent a good deal of time working with it. The functions don't work at all. Only the digital scale works and it is questionable. I can notice a 2-4 pound range on the same floor surface over a 5 minute period. This is junk. I give up and I'll never buy another one of these again, it was a complete waste of time."
1,Boby Fat Reading is Bogus,"I had my body fat measured with calipers and it was 14%. This scale says I am hugely obese at 30% body fat. What a joke! Just buy a regular scale or buy an expensive monitor, don't buy this if you think the fat measurements will be accurage."
2,not impressed.,Product did not last as long as I expected. The digits started to fade and we had to guess what the numbers were on the screen.
3,no usable return label enclosed,"There was no usable return label enclosed with this Omron HBF-400 Body Fat Monitor and Scale. I have gotten it working, it does ok but if I chose to return it, the invoice(?) enclosed looks like the printer was running out of ink and I can't distinquish the instructions and printed UPC. The 'invoice' itself was 1/4th the size of a normal sheet of paper and it made me feel that the company that shipped this item to me was strongly discouraging returns for any reason. The scale itself works after pushing alot of buttons and screaming at it but I don't trust a company that sells you an item and makes it very difficult to return it if it isn't what you wanted."
2,Maybe I'm judging too quickly,"This is the second BF scale I have used but the first Omron. The previous one had 4 buttons that you could push with your foot for each user's predefined settings this one only has one and then you have to use your finger to select the user (2 clicks). NOT COOL.I am currently slightly over 6'2"" and work out on a daily basis. For the 2 days I have owned this scale here are my readings at the same time:Monday May 24, 2010 8:00 am Weight: 200.8 BF: 27 BMI: 25.4Tuesday May 25, 2010 8:00 am Weight: 196.4 BF: 26.3 BMI: 24.9Does this seem wrong to anyone else?To play around with this I took 4 readings and my weight ranged from 196.0 to 196.4. I guess that isn't too bad but for the BMI and BF% to be so off is a little unnerving. I will keep this for another week before I decide what to do with it."
4,Excellent product I love it,it is really good for setting up target. there is one thing that this one gives different readings everytime.
3,what you see is what you get,"As advertised, scale comes with 3 functions (body mass index, body fat %, and weight). Display is faily large and rather easy to read. Setting up the user profiles is easy and takes less than a couple minutes. Comes with battery so it's ready to use upon arrival. All in all, a solid scale with basic functions."
4,Works as described,"Scale works exactly as described .. weight accuracy I would describe as good. The only thing I don't like is that depending on where you are standing on the scale, the weight does vary. As long as you are centered it seems to be very accurate. As with other reviewers - I don't put much accuracy in the body fat measurements, but it is a nice additional feature. I purchased it due to other reviewers noting the accuracy of weight, plus the ability to track last weights per user. Overall a good scale if you can find it at a good price."
5,Very pleased with product,Omron HBF-400 Body Fat Monitor and ScaleReceived scale and had little difficulty in programming. It does everything I want at a very reasonable price.
4,Omron HBF-400 Scale,"Excellent value for money scale with the added benefit of body fat monitoring. Although body fat monitoring need only be done occasionally, the feature works well and is easy to setup for individual user. Scale is very lightweight and is therefore easily portable. Construction seems a little flimsy but so far the scale has worked fine with no problems."
1,Disappointing,"There must be a lot of product quality issues for this scale to evoke such a love/hate response among reviewers. I also found the scale to be neither consistent or accurate. Each step on the scale comes up with a different weight measurement, none of them matching the scale at the doctors office. The fat measurements also bounced around and were at least 5 % higher than the number from the fitness trainer. I carefully followed the directions that came with the scale to produce the most accurate results- all except the disclaimer that the fat measurements may not be accurate for a post-menopausal woman. The assumptions programmed into the scale must be wrong for a lot of people! Fortunately the HoMedics version of the scale works for me."
4,Very good quality scale,"Bought this scale to replace one I've had for more than 3 years that started acting up. One thing I was not impressed with this Omron is the idea I have to push a button to start it. The old one I had, when I stood on it, it turned on automatically. The Omron, when I turn it on, it starts self calibrating, I guesss that's to make it more accurate, then again, that's why you have to push the button as I said earlier. But, overall, I am impressed with this unit and the build quality."
4,When I stepped on this scale it said -,"Only one person please, and then called me fatty.Worked like I expected and advertised. Big numbers and easy to setup."
5,Excellent scale,"This is a precise, accurate scale for a reasonable price. It makes tracking weight loss or gain so much easier! With other scales that only pretend to have +-0.1 or 0.2 pound accuracy, you can easily miss your small but steady weekly progress and become discouraged. Just for fun, you can drink a glass of water and note the change of 0.2lb or so. Buy this scale!"
4,Pretty good stuff,I like the display and the functions but it has lost the settings for the second user on two occasions now. This is annoying to say the least.The accuracy and function are outstanding.
2,"HBF-400 Good Scale, Bad Fat Monitor","The scale is pretty accurate but the fat monitor is nothing but a calculator based on Height and Weight...it's useless. BMI is accurate based on Height, Sex, Age and weight."
4,Works well,I was tired of having a scale that didn't match the one at my doctor's office. This one appears to be more accurate. The settings for Fat Monitor and BMI are handy though I don't use them much. I'm just trying to drop a few pounds and this gives me insight on how I'm doing.
2,scale's measurement accuracy ....weight ok...bodyfat not so much,"so the reason i got this scale was for the bodyfat percentage feature...thinking it was somewhat like the handheld ones. i know from other methods i'm around 12% bf...visible abs. according to this scale i was 26%...laughable. i know it sounds like i'm in denial...but trust me, i'm nowhere near 26. Weight seems about right...i'm 207...at 6'4. it would fluctuate .5 to .6 per pound if i stepped of and back on after a second.i've returned this item and have opted to go with the cheaper option of calipers.the instructions say this scale is not for highly trained athletes, so my assumption is that if your bf% is low, this is not the scale for you.just being honest."
3,A bit awkward to use.,"We have just started using this scale in the past week. It seems to work well and the numbers it reports seem reasonable. I like the history function. It is just a bit awkward to use. First you must turn it on and the handles must be in the base. Then when the scale shows zero you must pull the handle out, select your person number and step on the scale. When it completes the weight and that blinks twice, you have to raise the handle to shoulder height for the rest of the measurements. Get anything a little wrong or out of timing and the measurements are not correct or don't get recorded properly. Seems like they could have made it a little smarter/easier."
5,This works,"I used the Amazon customer comments before purchasing this one. I agree that if you take a few minutes to read the Users Guide when you receive it, it is very easy to use. Those in the household who only want their weight are using it without reading the instructions for BMI, etc. and are equally pleased.It seems accurate to me. I am nearsighted, so I was glad to find that the display ""holds"" the numbers until I can dismount the scale and bend down to read them. Also, every reading includes a comparison to the ""norms"" so you have a daily reminder to keep working your numbers into the good zone."
3,as others have said,"The precision and accuracy of the weight measurement is quite good. This fat % calculation is not accurate, but may be precise. I'd guess if one had a professional assessment of body fat one could track changes with this scale, ignoring the absolute quantity."
2,"Good start, then broke","Scale was easy to set up and use, but then it quit working about a month after I purchased it."
1,body fat measure does not work,"As many others pointed out, the body fat measurement is 6-12% higher than handheld device."
3,Great scale - Bad body fat monitor,"The scale is consistent and seems to be accurate compared to other scales. The body fat monitor is very wrong. It tells me that I have 23-24% body fat, no matter when I test. I visually guessed that I was around 12-15% and another body fat monitor backed this up. I was thinking about returning this item but it does work well as a scale, which is something that you need for a more accurate hand-held monitor. That's why I gave it 3 stars. It doesn't do everything well that it is supposed to do, but it is a moderately priced, accurate scale."
2,Look elsewhere,"Quite a disappointment.It doesnt really sense your feet or anything you have to put all the data manualy.it doesnt turn on/off automatically, but you have to kick/press a button.Also can't switch to Kg.I didnt get consistent results +- 1lb which is not accurate!returining this bad purchase...."
2,Inaccurate fat monitor,"For measuring weight this scale is fine. I did not have any problems following the instructions, setting up the scale, nor using it.I measured my fat (31%) and was surprised to find that I was 'obese' - at 5'6"" and 130 pounds.I then had my body fat measured at my health club and it was 16%. One of them is wrong and I'm (naturally!) inclined to think it's the scales, but I'll leave it to you to draw your own conclusions.I won't be returning the scale but I will be ignoring the fat measurement in future."
1,Do not buy,This is easily the worst scale I have ever owned in my life. It stopped working after about 6 months. Put new batteries in it. Seriously? How hard is it for a scale to read weight. I can configure every single user setting under the sun but the only functionality that I actually want and it no longer works after next to no use. I even read through the manual and no dice it is still junk.
2,I loved it when it worked.,"I loved it when it worked. It is out of warranty and the LED screen is missing almost all parts of numbers/letters. I can only see ""lb"" now. Weight and body fat was accurate when it worked. Would not buy again. I paid $60 for it and that's expensive scale if it only works about 5 years."
5,Very Pleased,"La verdad es que estoy muy contenta con este artículo, dado que comenzamos un régimen en mi familia, es espéctacular para controlar si nuestros porcentajes de grasa bajan y los músculos suben, es muuuyy sencillo de usar y como viene con 4 memorias podemos controlar sin inconveniente nuestros progresos.Lo único que yo le agregaría es un botón de RESET, para no tener que estar apagándolo y prendiendolo si nos queremos pesar 2 personas seguidas, por lo demás todo bien."
1,It Didn't Work,"After measuring my weight, the status bar indicating the beginning of body fat measurement would NOT appear. I returned it for full credit."
2,Too complicated,"I bought this product primarily as a digital scale. It was well reviewed on the Amazon website, but if your primary interest is weighing yourself on a daily basis, then get something else. After a few days, I returned it - it's way too complicated."
2,Nice Scale But Doesnt work on Carpet,Looks like a nice unit but does not work on carpet. Most other brands include longer feet to work on carpet floors but this did not and the scale was totally wrong on the weight.
2,"Extra Gadgets, who needs them?","This item has some nice features, but they are not always accurate.Since I weighed less on the old bathroom scale, I think I like it better than this one. My wife likes to keep track of all that stuff, but I'm a guy that wants the simple result."
2,Fat monitor inaccurate,"In general this product received good reviews here, but the question is -- how many people actually compared their fat monitor results to another source? When I received this product I tried it and my fat percentage was impossibly-high for someone of my build, blatantly wrong. I borrowed Omron's handheld unit from a friend and tested back-to-back and got a much more reasonable reading (although I can't say how accurate that one was either). The differences were approximately 6-8% off! The monitor is useless and I would return the scale if it weren't for the fact that I believe the scale portion to be accurate, the price wasn't bad, and it's a pain in the [...] to return stuff online. I'm not sure how reliable any monitor like this can be so I'm just going to have a professional test performed if I'm interested."
1,Body fat % horrifyingly inaccurate,"The last time I had my body fat percentage tested (with calipers) at the gym, it was 14%. This scale measured my percent body fat at 33%. I realize that the electric current method is never as accurate as the caliper method, but this scale's body fat percentage reading is, as another reviewer suggested, little more than a cruel joke. I am returning this scale and getting something $20 less expensive that I anticipate will read weight just as accurately."
2,not too happy,"Purchased this scale in May of 2009 and it worked fine and I was quite happy. Now in November of 2011, I have to buy another scale. The digital read out is no longer readable. Since I only used it every now and again I think this is unreasonable, considering I paid $42.00 for this item. I would not buy it again!"
5,Best bathroom scale I've ever had,"This is a very nice bathroom scale. It is accurate, attractive and easy to read. You do need to read a couple of pages of the manual or you won't be happy with it. Everything you need to know is there in about 2 pages. It is easy to program.Once programmed it will give you the Weight, %Fat and BMI. You can get the weight without any programming, but you still need to read part of a page in the manual.I've had it for several months and I'm very happy with it."
5,This is a stupidly fun game. :D,"This is a really fun game. The music is cute and catchy, and it's a solid collection of fun minigames that have so far entertained me more than the 8 disappointing Disney titles I have collecting dust in my GBA case.I would highly recommend it. :)"
2,Even five bucks is too much,"Well, in a nutshell, it's a boring game, with poorly developed interface (commands are either not present or take time to issue, especially build cancellation, queueing, and some other stuff). The graphics are pretty good, I must say, but the whole set-up seems to be rather demanding - the game would consistently crash when the maximum number of units was built. Also, the battles would often become protracted, since most units have very high miss ratio, especially many crystalline units. The races are VERY DIFFERENT, which is one of the few redeeming qualities of the game (other being price and graphics).So, overall, you would probably do well spending your money on something else, such as ORB."
5,Very large delightful puzzle,I bought the puzzle for vacation and we didn't get to it. When we got home we put it out on a table and worked on it for a few days. The final picture is beautiful and we learned a lot about endangered animals. I especially loved the border. Some of the animals were easy to assemble and some were challenging so it was a perfect puzzle for a group.
4,"good service, good price",Apart from being quite warm for the South (not a producer's fault..) the set is good-looking as well a good quality (light weight).
4,Finally got around to reading this one,"I've had this book for YEARS sitting on a bookshelf and finally just got around to reading it. I'm sorry I waited so long. The recipes are surprisingly simple! This is a great choice for QUICK & EASY meals, especially if you work full time or have demands during the day (children, etc) that make it difficult to spend hours at the stove. The Mexican Spegetti Pie was a pleasant surprise too, tasted good (and it's a great idea for what to do with leftover spegetti, and you can change the ingredients to suit what you have available in the house)! Gives many ideas for changing the way you serve pasta, this book would be perfect if you're stuck in the ""spegetti and red sauce"" rut. Definitely not a gourmet cookbook, but perfect for the everyday cook that doesn't have alot of time and doesn't want to get caught up searching for exotic ingredients."
2,"Great concept, needs finishing.","While this is a great idea the execution is somewhat lacking. There are a lot of minor issues which pile up to really weaken the product. One, for example, is that the software fails to disable the ""auto off"" feature of the visor when appending an already existing recording. I lost about 5 important recordings before I figured this problem out.The standalone feature is more or less useless to me because it only records at high quality in this mode, limiting recording time to 15 mins. Also there is no way to delete tracks in standalone, so once the recorder is filled up you can do nothing with it until you can get it into your visor.One more thing to beware of is that if you use a serial hotsync cradle your synchronization time will be approx 15 to 20 minutes when the recorder is full."
1,"Great idea, engineered poorly.","Good: plenty of memory for recordings, easy integration with Hot Sync, nice standalone size. Bad: easy to misrecord, notes are time stamped when plugged into Visor not when recorded, big battery drain, Palm software sluggish and cumbersome. Better use of your money to buy a different gadget."
1,Not acceptable,"I have been unable to use this item as intended. It seems to record when I don't want it to, yet doesn't work when I need it.The battery compartment is poorly manufactured, and the recording module does not snap in tightly. I must physically push on it when recording, and even then it runs intermittently.The record button is easily bumped, and there's nothing to protect it from turning on by itself while in a pocket or purse (independent of the visor pda), so the battery drains.You cannot record while it's installed in the PDA without using the touch-screen, as the buttons are inaccessible.I have also never figured out how to transfer the files to my PC; there are no clear-cut instructions explaining it."
1,beware: fine print on box - transfer to PC req Win 98 or 00,"On the side of the box:""Voice Desktop Application to transfer you recording to your PC. (requires Windows 98 or 2000)""The ""Total Recall"" worked fine in my Handspring and with its stand alone power source. However, I wasn't able to sync it with my desktop. After doing the normal uninstall/reinstall with no results, I wrote Targus. I also asked about the fine print noted above. They recommended I upgrade my Handspring OS, which I did, but to no avail. Customer Service was responsive, but ultimately unable to help me solve this problem. They eventually sent me a new ""Total Recall"". However, this time neither the stand alone power source nor the actual recorder worked. Unless you have Windows 98 or 2000, you might end up wasting a lot of time."
1,Cool item but didn't work!,"This is a very cool item. It's fucntional and nicely designed. Sounds good but I couldn't get it to work with my Visor Deluxe. Customers service was fair via email. They got back to me within 24 hrs each time but in the end they couldn't help-but to get them to admit it I had to pointedly ask. They just had no idea why it didn't work for me. I reinstalled the supplied software and the Palm desktop multiple times with no luck.So, I wouldn't suggest anyone buy this item until they can get it to function properly-or you give it a try and make you can return it for a full refund. :( Very disappointed here."
2,"Fair buy, but too many cut out scenes.","Rubi is by far my favorite novela, but I was disappointed to notice that way to many scenes had been edited out of this dvd. So much so, that at times it's difficult to keep up with what is happening. You will notice this especially if you compare an episode from the dvd with the ones featured on youtube. Of course the main scenes were not cut out, but it's always nice to see what happened prior to the big moments. I wouldn't discourage anyone from buying this product, but be aware of the many edits. And if you would like an overview of the soap opera, this is a fair buy."
2,Rubi is a pleasant surprise and shouldn't be missed!,This spanish soap opera is highly recommended! It brings three dual layered discs. Six sides total. Over 7 hours. Many parts are edited from the soap opera but it is still quite watchable. It also has english subtitles. Some nice extras as well. My biggest gripe all the discs were loose moving freely inside and got scratched alot due to it. Also noticed the audio track raises up and lowers down at times. Might be due to the scratches on the disc. The discs should be secured better inside the box they came in. Now I have to get an exchange for them. Cause of it.5 stars for Rubi. 2 stars for the scratched discs.
3,Good Soap,"Good ""novela"", however, wish that it was not so chopped up. If you did not watch it on Univision, then you would be lost. I thought I was purchasing the ""novela"" in its original verision."
5,Addictive and Dangerous,"Rubi has looks men admire and women envy. Her ambitions are high, but dangerous. She will use her beauty and cunning desire to get whatever she wants. There is of course Alejandro who is the love of her life, but even he is pushed aside as she aims for her dreams of grandeur. Will she ever come to her sense or keep pushing until she falls over?Barbara Mori excels as Rubi and really brings her to life. She makes you hate her and want her at once. The supporting cast too is excellent, but Rubi is the star just like she would like it. One of the better telenovelas recently made, you will be hooked by the first episode.Great stuff!"
2,same as cuidao con el angel purchase,"I would not recommend any one to purchase these products,its just a waste of time, not clear and its edited too much.One of the reason why I am not purchasing other products"
1,GREAT NOVELA BUT 1 DVD DIDN'T NOT PLAY. IT ARRIVED DAMAGED!,This is such a great story and when I watched it I got to side 4 and it was SO damagedand scratched that it wouldn't play on any of my DVD players. It was frustratingbecause all of the other DVD's worked just fine. Side 3 was also scratched anddamaged so badly but for some reason it did play.I wish that I could get a new one without buying it but it's been a while sinceI purchased it. I saw it again online and am thinking of buying it again. It'sjust a shame that I didn't open it right away and watch it so that I could haveexchanged it. I don't remember who the seller is anymore but I wish I did so thatI can send them an email asking for a replacement.If you buy this Novela it's great as long as you get good working DVD's.
3,Cut version and no Spanish subtitles available,"I am disappointed because of the many cuts they made in comparison to the TV episodes that have been aired.(I am from Germany, and the first few episodes were running on German TV ""RTL"" but then they were suddenly cancelled, but these episodes that they actually aired were un-cut.)So I bought this DVD to see all of ""Rubi"". It's a pity it is cut. I'd like the un-cut version. I hope it will be released one day. I cannot get enough of ""Rubi"", my favourite telenovela.I would have liked Spanish subtitles and German subtitles, in my case. Watch out: English subtitles only on this DVD! And the language the DVD's are in are Spanish.By the way: if you'd like to see Rubi as an uncut version in German language, you can still watch it on ""rtlnow"" at the moment, too.But it's very expensive, to view all the episodes there. I like Rubi's original voice better than the German synchronization."
5,Rubi-la mejor novela que he visto en mi vida,"This novela was truly a spectaucalar one,Rubi is hot,beautiful,and sexy all in one but as she is sexy she is evil.Really a great novela and I would recommend it to anyone."
3,Awesome Novela but the DVD is bad,"The only reason I gave it three stars was because I absolutely love the novela and it was interesting to see the Rubi that was made still in black and white.Although I saw the warnings that it was chopped up and not the full novela, but I did not think that is actually that bad.But it is very bad basically the story line is lost so many good scenes not there and it was a huge disappointment in that sense.However, I was happy with the product overall it was okay.So if you are a Rubi fan you might still like it, if you want to watch the whole novela do not buy it, its on youtube."
2,Rubi,Rubi is severly cut in all duration of the movie. Why do they do this? Want to buy some more telenovelas but am warry. Perhaps when I see a review that people who bought them said NO MORE CUTS! Then will I start buying them again. Sorry. It just makes me so mad!!!
2,Disapointed,I was so excited to order and recieve this telenovela Rubi. I seen part of it air on tv and hated to see it end. I ordered this for the english subtitles and Im new to telenovelas and Rubi was the first one I had really tried to keep up with. When I received the DVD in the mail and started to watch it I noticed it was very chopped up from editing and some of the parts I really liked and wanted to know what was said was missing. Also I noticed some of the other good actors were not shown much. Rubi is a good telenovela but If you really want to see it and you know your spanish then I would recommend watching it on tv when it airs again or buying the unedited version if there is one out there.
3,Rubi,The novela Rubi in itself is excellent. The theme was fascinating and the actors and actresses were fabulous. With that said having the opportunity to purchase it and watch it while stationed overseas with no spanish channels is thrilling. I am no expert in film but thought it was well put together and easy to follow even if some scenes of the TV version were missing. Definitely a must watch for anyone interested in spanish soaps.
4,"Rubi, so beautiful and yet so evil!","I've loved this soap opera since it came out some years ago. the fact that the main character is a beautiful and evil woman-instead of those poor girls who suffer and suffer eternally, you know, the usual main characters in soaps- caught my attention.Although there are many scenes which don't appear on this 700-minute edition, you can easily understand why Rubi is so evil. I love her, and I love this edition. I would love them to release a full edition, with all the episodes! Barbara Mori is so hot! Every time she's on screen she makes me feel something, even though I'm not straight!"
5,Rubi on DVD...,"I receieved Rubi on DVD promptly and in perfect codition . There are 3 DVD's that play on both sides. Nothing extra special. Good price and fast shipping, I can't complain."
4,Comentario sobre la Edicion en Dvd de Rubi,"Me gusto la Edicion del Dvd, la verdad es que esta bien editado, y tiene mucha coherencia. Lo que no me gusto fue que le sacaron el tema de Reyli, La Descarada y pusieron otro que se llama Mala Mujer, pero esta bien, dentro de todo, no es mala la cancion, pero no tiene la Original. Despues note que la Musicalizacion no es la misma que la de la Transmision Televisiva. Los Extras son Muy Buenos, Contiene Bloopers y El Especial de Rubi contado por su sobrina y Loreto, aunque la parte final queda inconclusa. Tiene una Duracion de Mas de 780 Minutos y la Presentacion, la Portada y el Diseño esta Muy Lindo!!!"
4,PLEASE SEND!!,I did not receive the 3rd double-sided CD for RUBI.... can someone make me a copy and please send it to me???
3,The Night Has a Thousand Eyes 1999,"I purchased this music cd because it included the song MOON RIVER.Unfortunately, it was on the jazzy side. I'm not much into jazz.This music cd is jazz oriented."
2,Not worth the money,"This book by Larry Burkett of whom I have the utmost respect (I reguarly listen to his radio show on finances), seemed to me very, very shallow. The book measures just 6.5"" X 4"". It has less than 43 pages of actual information if you include the glossary (which has a total of 13 words). On average, each page addresses 2 topics. The information is generally sound, but little explaination is given as to why one should do such and such. The subject of finances is for teenagers, but if your teenager is going to college, he won't be impressed by this book. But what really got me going was the [price] retail price! I would price it more like [cheaper price]. Having said all of the above I would like to still encourage readers to continue to buy and read books by Mr. Burkett. You will never go wrong with any of his advise. I bought his book ""Money Matters for Teens"" at [price] (still a little pricy in my opinion) which seems great at first glance."
4,Kagnew Station,"A book of this type must be reviewed on 2 levels.Level 1 as a mystery novel: A really great book with a plot you can understand and enjoy with the intrigue of a potential tryst. The story takes place in some far away places and has enough detail in the story line and the locations to make it all believeable.Level 2 on location: Paul, thanks for taking me back to Kagnew and refreshing my memory to the beauty of the area and the wonderful tastes and smells. (Tract F Jan 69 - Jul 71)."
5,Kagnew Station,"Loved the plot line. Kept me interested. Especially loved going back in time to Kagnew, where I have many fond memories of buddies on ""D"" Trick, Company B, '61-'63."
1,A different product shipped,"What I received is NOT a LEXAR: it has NO brand name. Besides, it did not come with the pedestal as shown in the product picture."
5,"Wisdom for Traders, Not ""Trading for Dummies""","This book is about the mindset and mental habits a trader needs to be successful in the markets. Every successful trading career has been a process of learning the ""rules"" in this book. If you can imagine a good friend with years of experience giving you advice on how to improve your trading; that is exactly how this book reads. This book IS NOT a ""how to place a trade book."" It IS an excellent book on what not to do once a trade has been placed. No book can replace the school of hard knocks every trader has to go through in order to succeed, but if you embrace the principles contained in this book and make them your own; you will save yourself a ton of money. You may even save yourself enough money to stay in the game."
3,Good information but not enough depth,"I am fairly new at this stuff so I find the information in this book quite interesting and useful. It provides the reader with much to think about even if you question the validity of the author's conclusions. What I find lacking is examples and references. For example, the author suggests three parts of a trade and suggests that the only part that actually makes the trader money is the ""management of positions."" A reference to information on what this Management involves, or a reference to some other book (since it's probably beyond the scope of this one book) or some more detail beyond the extreme importance of this would be nice. In short, the information is great but the depth is lacking."
2,Very general stuff,"Other books on the market will give more original content. Was looking for more in-depth information and recommendations. Would be nice to add various market ""conditions"" to examples."
2,blah,"I didn't care enough for this book to read the whole thing. I found it dull and uninspiring.I read the first few pages of each rule and that's it.I think this author my have been a good trader 100 years ago, (and some things never change) but really?!I would really prefer advice from someone more current."
4,Re-discovered lost gem,"Pat Simmons released this album back in the early 80's and was pretty much forgotten about..until now. Amazingly, this music sounds refreshing nowadays. It has many different flavors of music on it, from the hard rocking ""Out on the Streets"" and ""Knocking at Your Door"" to the easy rock of ""Dream About Me"" ""Don't Make Me Do It"" and ""Why You Givin' Up"" to the jazzy ""Sue Sad"". The radio hit was the song ""So Wrong"" which hit the charts in the summer of 1983. Pick this one up and enjoy."
3,Patrick Simmons Arcade,As the writter for many Doobie Brothers songs my expectations for this album were very disapointing. I am a collector of records like this one but Pats efforts were not at all what I expected. Sorry Pat.
1,So WRONG !!!!!!!,"What happens when you take 1 of the 3 main songwriters of the Doobie, pair him up with other members of the Doobies and employ the services of the great producer Ted Templeman?Unfortunately, The same thing that happened when Tom Johnston tired to make a ""hip 80's"" album.Come on people theres NOTHING classic about this album. And for a very GOOD reason; the songs are WEAK.Patrick Simmons' strength lies in acoustic/electric based songs with layered harmonies and interesting chords (and oh yeah, real drums)lol.Let's face it. There's NONE of that here. This is a very weak attempt at a solo album I really wish I could say differently, but MOST Doobies fans would be VERY disappointed with this"
1,arrived already spoiled,"i have bought harmony sunflower seeds before and quite liked them, but this time, i ordered this mid-september and the product arrived already spoiled (smelled and tasted rancid.) product was sent with nov 08 expiry but had clearly gone off somewhere beforeamazon at least was quite helpful and has agreed to reship a new stock to replace!"
2,"Taste is not so good, Have had better.","This product could use a little more better grade of seeds, These taste a little old."
4,A worthy successor to Stevenson,"Alan Breck Again,is a sequal to Kidnapped and David Balfour. It is the story of Ian MacDonald, who helps Alan Breck search for stolen jacobite treasure. Although not up to the standard of Stevenson, Smith has caught the mercurial personality of Alan Breck. One of the drawbacks to the story is the use of dialect in it. Although, Kidnapped uses the same techique it doesn't seem as confusing as it is here. Overall, however, for any person who is a fan of Kidnapped, this story is well worth reading."
1,don't have the book,"I don't have the book, it never came to the adress I wrote down and the due date changed, so I'm confused"
1,Taste like rain water,This may be good for you but it is sooooooooooo bland. I try to add things to it to give it some taste. I cant even give this stuff away. No one likes it. The chicken soup is good tho.
1,Half the cans arrived bent,The soup was a good price compared to grocery stores but half the cans were seriously bent in the middle. It appeared that Amazon was shipping what the big buyers were rejecting. I bought 48 cans of soup shipped in three different shipments so there was no reason cans on the inside should be bent in the middle. I was very disappointed but had been warned by previous feedback. Won't buy again.
1,Horrible,"Cheap, poorly made and really bad performance.Don't waste your money buying this thing. The sub is horrible, can't handle any kind of really low loud effects. The satellites are ok but they are nothing impressive.Worst product i've ever bought."
2,This mouse worked great for the first few months...,"...and then it broke. Although it's still under warranty, Targus's policy stipulates that the consumer is responsible for shipping costs to the company. I really DID like this mouse when it worked, but shipping it back out for repairs is not worth the money, in my opinion. I plan on picking up a Logitech mouse next...I've had better luck with their products in the past (although my Targus notebook case is holding up quite nicely)."
1,2 dead in as many weeks,This thing is basically junk. The first one would only move the mouse side to side. The second one just up and died completely. Cheap and junky. I expect better from Targus. Spend 20 bucks on shipping to make a warranty claim on a 30 dollar item. Stupid
1,Waste of money,"Purchased this mouse a couple months ago. I constantly would have problems with the connection to my computer. While working, the computer would lose the connection to the mouse and I would have to remove and reconnect the mouse to my computer. Today, the mouse stopped working all together."
5,Long Live the Mouse,"I'm ordering a second one of this model today. This is not because of any problems. It is quite the opposite. I bought the first one in (I think) late 2008 and use it with a laptop. It has performed flawlessly.I am a six footer with large hands but it fits very naturally and comfortably in my hand. The spring stiffness of the left and right clickers is just right. With the exception of the new Magic Mouse that came with my newest iMac, this is one of the nicest mice I've used in 25+ years of mousing.Note: The dimensions stated above have a miscue. They must be the dimensions of the shipping box. My handy dandy ruler shows it to be approx. 2"" wide and 3.75"" long not including the cord."
3,Worthless in 7 months,"I loved this mouse so much that I immediately bought another one. But suddenly after 7 months they both suddenly died (within a few days of one another). I tried them on multiple computers to make sure the problem was not with the computer itself. Unless you consider 7 months to be an acceptable lifespan for a mouse, don't buy this one."
3,If you knew Susie like I know Susie,"In this 50's TV comedy series, the private secretary to talent agent Peter Sands (Don Porter), Susan Camille MacNamara (Ann Sothern) goes out of her way to help her boss in the most convoluted schemes. Some how she always puts her foot in it; yet in the end everything turns out fine.Either a victim of old age or bad memory (possible the world has changed); I found this series to be straining for laughs.The DVD volume one contains:""Cat in a Hot Tin File""""Dollars and Sense""""Old Dogs, New Tricks""""That's no Lady, That's an Agent""If you enjoyed the acting of Don Porter then you should not miss him in the Bob Hope classic ""Bachelor in Paradise"" (1961)The version I watched was distributed by alpha video and was not remastered (it really should have been). The images do not hold up well on today's big screen TV'sBachelor in Paradise [VHS]"
5,"Truly ""Heaven""-ly","After being an avid wearer of the original Dr. Scholl's, I thought I'd try this new style. I needed a new pair of black sandals, so I bought the black color of these. They ended up being so completely comfortable, a week later I bought them in the stone color as well.This is the perfect shoe for Dr. Scholl's lovers, but also a great option for those with sensitive feet that haven't been able to wear the wood-soled Dr. Scholl's before."
2,Where do you use it?,"I bought the LightSabre Bivy for solo backpacking trips because of the light weight and compact size. It is very light (11oz with poles!) and easy to pack, and seems to be durable and easy to use once you get the hang of setting up the poles. Be aware that it has a serious problem with condensation. As long as you can keep the top open, it may be ok, but if it rains or snows and you really need the protection, you may as well stand in the rain. On a very cold evening in a light snow on White Pass in the Glacier Peak Wilderness Area, I crawled in and closed the cover against the snow to take a nap. When I woke up, the inside of the entire bivy was dripping on me. My gear was soaked and I ended up hiking all the way out. I'm not sure where I can use it that I couldn't just as well do without it. Also, the bivy is for those who are adept at sealing seams."
1,Do Not Waste Your Time or Money On This Book !,"My Instructor told me not to waste my $$$ on this book. The first two or three chapters are acceptable, yet the remainder of the book is very poor. It has the simple basic strikes and counters that all ""How To"" books of Karate manuals have.It is not the Way of Self Defense as the title would attempt to allude one."
4,Luther's Large Catechism,I thought it was pretty good. Easy to understand for the most part. I thought it was definitely worth my time to read it. And it increased my desire to serve God.
3,All About Lutheran,"This book is smilar to Luther's own small catechism, but deals with only differant aspects of theutheran dogma than it. In this there are covered: The 10 Commandments, The Lord's Prayer, Baptism and Sacrament of the altar, among others. What I really like is that you need to be in attendance regularly of a Lutheran church to really know what is being talked about in this book. Martin Luther, the author of this book, rifting from the Catholic church in the 1500s and founded the Protestant branch of CHristianity and his last name Luther is where the Lutheran denomination comes from. Don't mistake Martin Luther with Martin Luther King Jr. Though King Jr. is on a similar stature in Christianity with him, they were two differant people during two differant eras in Christianity."
1,Worst made toy I have seen in years,"I gave this toy to my daughter last night, and already the string is so frayed it will break any second. My daughter is really unhappy because she wanted this thing so much, and now I have to return it. We aren't even going to bother getting another one. What a waste of time and money."
2,Great fun- for a short time.....save your money,"My daughter begged for this for Christmas- after about 15 tries- the string would no longer pull. We assumed she had been rough on the toy and wrote it off, so when she wanted to buy another one with her own money- we gave her the talk about being careful with the string, pulling carefully, etc. etc.- same thing with the new one- after about 15 pulls the string pulled out and would not rewind. It is a lot of fun- but if you buy this toy- know it is essentially a prettier version of those bamboo planes boys fly 10 times and then they break."
1,recall,my daughter received this toy as a present. the pull string broke within the 1st day. later we learned that this toy has been recalled because of the dangerousness of it. there is no way to control where the skydancer flies.
1,BTW: it was recalled...,"CPSC, Galoob Toys Inc. Announce Recall of Sky Dancers Flying Dolls...http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml00/00134.html"
1,Can someone share what got shipped,"Can someone who was brave enough to order the product, share what actually gets shipped. The filter in the picture looks like a Size ""D"" filter but that obviouosly does not mean that's what shipped."
4,Enjoyable read,"For the most part I enjoyed this book. I did however get a bit tired of the "" well there is no evidence so we dont know for sure attitude. perhaps a trained historian could have done a little better. Better than Sandoz book!"
1,Am I missing something cause this stuff constipates me.,I don't know if I'm doing something wrong but I usually go off at least once a day or once every other day and my stools are soft enough. But whenever I take this stuff I end up constipated. How can this be? What am I doing wrong? Am I missing something?
4,tastes awful but very effective,"if you can get this stuff down, it is extremely effective; Mix it with juice to dilute the effect. After a week or so you get used to it (sort of)."
4,Knit with the help of your needles!,"This charming book from the past is helpful to the young girl learning to knit and crochet, and historically interesting. Projects are small and quick, with easy-to-follow instructions. I wish the typeface had been updated, but I suppose it would have lost some of the old-fashioned feel of the time in which it was written. My 12 year old daughter, who has trouble following instructions, found the story format helpful."
1,"Racist, and not so good on the knitting, either","While the concept of this book is charming- the wool, needles and hooks come alive to teach little Mary Frances to knit and crochet- the reality is less charming. The knitting and crocheting instruction is basic and there are many other books out there that are more useful. The book, written in the early part of the last century, is flawed by racist content. Instructions for making a yarn baby and a ""Mammy"" doll are fairly offensive. I would hesitate to use it in any setting that involved children, unless you need a jumping off point for a discussion about racisim. If it's knitting for children you are after, than I suggest one of the many other fine books that have been written to meet this need."
4,The puzzle pieces fall together,In this installment Mitchell recovers from her wounds and Mitch goes back undercover. We get to see Mitchell deal with the stresses brought on by her sister Erica's appearance. Erica gets a dose of reality administered by Sandy. I thought that was funny because Erica doesn't expect it. Rebecca and Catherine commit further to their relationship. Sloan must clear her name again as someone is murdered blocks from her residence that tie in to Michael's accident. The team must then come together for Mitch's undercover operation where a member of the team is injured yet again. Another action packed installment. I can't wait for the finale.
1,Not much mystery,"After reading Shield Of Justice I couldn't wait to read another book by Radclyffe, but this book is nothing more than a book of timid lesbian sex disguised as a mystery. I love lesbian erotica, lesbian love stories and just about anything lesbian as long as the book is honest about what kind of book it is. To call this book a mystery is stretching it. Give me Ellen Hart or J.M. Redmann or Gerri Hill anytime."
5,The Southern Ladies say goodbye,What can you say about the last season of Designing Women?? It wasnt the best but it wasnt the worst. That goes to the previous season. This season is better than I recalled. Its got its funny moments. The addition to BJ to the cast is great after the awful casting of Julia's cousin. This is a season you must get!
5,Hated to have the series end,I'm so glad the issues over the music was settled to we could get Designing Women on DVD!! I love these gals.
5,So funny!!,I love this serie and was extatic to be able to receive this final season. I couldn't stop watching it and I am about to watch it again!The delivery was perfect by the way...
2,"No Delta, No Show","""Designing Women"" thrived due to the chemistry between four amazing actresses: Delta Burke, Dixie Carter, Annie Potts, and Jean Smart. As far as I'm concerned, the show ended at the end of season 5. I give this season two stars simply because Dixie, Annie and Alice (Bernice) appear. Aside from their performances, well, it's just a hot mess. Love you, Delta & Jean! :)"
2,Might have received a bad batch,"For some reason, I couldn't find this soup in the stores anymore. After receiving my shipment, I could only tolerate a few cans of it. I ate a can for lunch on two separate days and this soup wreaked havoc on my GI system for about 3 days. My stomach is still gurgling as I type. Maybe I received a bad batch but I will not be eating this soup again. However, I AM a big fan of the Health Choice Chicken and Dumplings, which come with no side effects. :)"
1,HORRIBLE SOUP Healthy Choice Vegetable Beef,"Healthy Choice Vegetable Beef Soup. TRUST ME, This soup is HORRIBLE. Does not taste like any soup I've Ever tasted. No Beef Flavor. Taste more like the metal can. Vegetables are hard. Heating the soup longer won't make the vegetables softer. I'll never buy healthy choice again. Zero Stars."
3,Mediocre,"My review falls inbetween the previous two reviews. While I do not consider this soup horrible, the prospect of consuming 11 more cans is unappealing."
2,Not Very Good......,"This is the worst book I ever read.The story was realy long andit didn't make sense at all!I give it two star because there was avery good plot but thats not what makes a book good all the time.I could see how some people might like this book so,you should give thought after reading this reveiw.Remember what I said though because it could make a difference. (if you think you might like this book don't let me stop you)"
5,Read it as a child and as an adult!,"A while back when I was in my 30's (never mind how long ago that was!) I was sick with the flu, and I found a copy of HEIDI, so I crawled into a nice warm bed and re-read the book -- as an adult.What insight into human nature! And as an adult I appreciated the dry, understated humor. I also appreciated the spiritual insights -- that God will give us what we desire, but sometims uses circumstances we don't like to teach us truths that we couldn't learn otherwise.When I was a girl I was often turned off by what was called ""good reading,"" but for some reason, I enjoyed Heidi and it never seemed sappy or corny.Very much worth reading!"
2,not the best edition,"I decided to read Heidi with my 9 year old, but thought the unabridged version might be too long and drawn out for her to sit through. Thought this one would be great, but I was wrong. It was extremely simple and actually had many spelling errors. This version is probably better for a 7 year old. It also omitted alot of important themes in the book. For example, this book completely overlooked Peter's jealousy of Clara. IT was a short and simple summary. Nothing compares to the original."
4,Heidi,"This book is about a little girl named Heidi who is sent to live with a rich family in a city. Heidi befriends her adopted sister, Clara, who is confinded to a wheel chair. But, Heidi misses her grandfather and her mountain home."
5,Say it ain't so!,"Ok, I'm reading the editorials on these Heidi books and they are all the SAME. What is this retold by business? Why would you want to retale a classic story? I'm not about to buy a book for my daughter that is a retold piece of junk. What is it now -- politically correct or some such junk? I want the REAL HEIDI who had dark curly hair, not some bimbo blonde I see on some of thse illustrations. I can't understand why this story needs to be retold when the original story was so great and which I might add I read at least 3 times when I was a child. How would you like to read a RETOLD Shakespere or Poe? But, maybe you meant to say is was retold like in translated from its original language."
1,Too bad...not too good.,"I saw this singer, Rashida Jolley, on America's Got Talent a few years ago. I thought she was great, singing while acompanying herself on harp. She sang the Roberta Flack number, ""Killing Me Softly"". I though her performance was just fantastic...so much so that I got in touch with her and asked if she had recorded anything...she said ""Yes"" and I bought this CD. Unfortunately, ""Killing Me Softly"" is not on this CD and the ""originals"" that are on it are mediocre...to be charitable."
1,steer clear,"You might want to steer clear of Elemental Designs, particularly now. My subwoofer, purchased in 2009, worked for less than 6 months before the amp went. Since then I have had to battle them for replacement amplifiers, the first took 8 months. None has worked, they all go bad within days. Very poor quality control, even worse customer service. In three years mine has never worked correctly. Now I have been waiting since January for my third amplifier replacement, and unfortunately all emails go unanswered, and their voicemail inbox is full. It appears they are going out of business and leaving many people with unfilled orders and broken merchandise. I highly recommend other internet-direct companies, these people are shady, to say the least."
1,Stay away from this company!!,Elemental Designs must be close to closing and going out of business. They haven't responded to my phone calls or emails in 3 months about an order I placed in May. Be very cautious about this company!!
5,AIM HerbalLife,Wonderful product for detoxifying the body. Was recommended to take 1 month for each year sick. My health has greatly improved!
5,Aim Products,"Good product, well packaged, prompt delivery. Price has not fluctuated greatly, still affordable.I have used this product for over 15 years."
2,"Might be good for an Older Child, but not under 3 months","I purchased this ""rocker"" for my new born thinking that it is Maclaren, so it must be outstanding. I have been disapointed, not by the quality, that's fine, but by the lack of effect that it has on my child. She hates it. The seat is two big right now to nestle her, and comfort her. Also, as it is advertised as a rocker, I thought that it would rock on it's own. It doesn't, which is fine unless you are buying this so that you can buy some time to take a shower. There is only one vibration setting, and the toys aren't incredibly interesting. As my daughter grows older, maybe the seat will be comfortable for her, and it may become more useful, but as for right now, the $79 rocker is sitting folded up in the closet. It does fold up very compactly. Hope that this helps."
1,Not a safe product at all,i bought this a month before my baby was born.. when she was born i used it.. well the frame is so cheaply made (aluminum) that it broke while my baby was in it.. Maclaren gave me the run around and finally said it was my fault.. my baby weighs only 7 pounds.. i highly doubt it was my fault and it was used only when i went to my moms which was not very often..! So now i have to pay for a new frame!! But i dont recommend this for your baby.. its not safe.. and they will do nothing about it.
3,"Good, But Not As Good As Previous Batch!","This is the third batch of full-size briefs by Champion that I bought on the net in fourteen years. They are still Champions, but very easy to see and feel as I wear them that they are not nearly as good in quality as the two previous purchases. The waisband is somewhat sloppily sewn in the small of the back where the band comes together; the fabric is not as firm and of the old quality, and not as well-turned and sewn at the various seams. I despair of finding another great batch of Champion briefs if and when the ones I have now wear out."
5,Bergman's masterpiece,"This story of a dying woman whose sisters are emotionally unable to care for her needs, is absolutely riveting. Sven Nykvist's photography is unparalled. The scenes with the maid [the only one in the house able reach out and care for this woman] are among the best, you feel that you are intruding and you should leave, but the camera stays and records,unblinkingly, the scene."
2,My Least Favorite Bergman,"Really didn't think this movie was as convincing and gut wrenching as most of Bergman's films. He does happen to be in my top list of directors, but this movie just didn't blow my mind. The chemistry of the actresses just wasn't there. It didn't achieve the amount of misery i expected because it simply is not bergman at his finest. I even could consider it a bit boring. I story line sounds wonderful, the movie itself...not quite there..."
2,Save your money,Poorly acted. Weak plot. The movie description led me to believe there would be something to watch here. Expensive lesson.
5,Deeply Moving and Emotional,"Certainly this is Bergman's best film. His most beautiful, deepest and severe work. The photography by Sven Nykvist, Bergman's long-time collaborator, is among the most amazing in film history, with the predominance of red, the color of the soul, according to the director. It is the story of a woman in agony who is surrounded by her sisters. All the film is a series of monumental and terrifying sequences, and the only person who can give the dying woman love and affection is the maid. Scenes à la Pietá, sensitive phrases about time passing, and other details make this production a truly masterpiece."
3,A bit too heavy!,"After using it the first time, I really thought I found the perfect conditioner. However, after a few times using it, I discovered that if I put just a little too much on my hair, it was so heavy, my hair wouldn't hold the curl. It's a good product, but a bit pricey."
3,The review of Practical Business Statistics,"It's a very good book because of the way it divulges you into the real world. If you are interested in learning business and business statistics, what better place to learn it than the real world."
3,"Great Computer-Based Examples, Just Okay Otherwise","This book does a great job of teaching you how to do statistical computations using StatPad and MS Excel. But, it is not very good at describing fundamentals. It left students in my MBA program who haven't takin' stats for a long time lost. I understand it is generally used by business schools, particularly MBAs.One thing this book has over any stats book that I've used is: a friggin' TON of practice questions. It will boggle your mind and, if you do them, you'll know stats like the back of your hand."
2,Practical Business Statistics,"Overall, a very basic and easy to follow introduction to statistics. I'm a wildlife sciences major and while the focus of the book is VERY different, the concepts still apply. A very easy introduction into statistics and the excel-based exercises are helpful."
2,Mediocre.,"This is not the best book on the subject. There are many other superior books to this one. I still keep it around as a descent reference on statistics, and occasionally get something out of it."
2,What story?,"This book is written in separate sections that address three different female characters. All the characters have a connection with the publishing world, whether it be as a writer or an agent. It would be a stretch to say that their stories are really connected much in any way.While reading this book, I got the distinct impression that Keyes sat down to write this without really having a plot in mind. The book teters on boring up until the end, when some things actually happen. Whatever story actually lies in this book is nearly so inexistant that I wondered what the point of anything was. I have liked some other of Keyes' books though; I would recommend Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married."
2,ho-hum until the last chapter or two,"Took me forever to read this. It just wasn't really a page turner for me, so I would set it down and not come back to it for weeks at a time. I wish it would have pulled me in quicker, because the characters were all very apealing, but just didn't have much movement. I kept waiting to see what direction it all would go, but finally in the last few chapters, things picked up. Not my favorite Keyes book, sorry."
2,Not that much fun..,"I guess I'm the only one who is a little tired of reading about morally deficient, alcoholic Irish and British women who have the messiest lives imaginable due to a complete lack of ability to make a decent decision.I started out being entertained by Marion Keyes books. Loved ""Watermelon"" but am so tired of these, ultimately, tiresome women who feel as Jojo does that she isn't doing much wrong if she doesn't want to split up the marriage of her married lover. Yep, that makes it all OK.These women have sex with whomever comes along, drink like fish, and live in pig-pens. What's funny about that?"
3,a bit of a let down,"I love Marion Keyes' stories. I read one after the other as soon as I discovered her. I'm always looking forward to her next book. More than once her stories have touched me in a very personal way. She knows what we think and how we feel. But I have to say this story was a bit of a dissapointment. The characters didn't have the same depth and personality as I've come to expect from Ms Keyes. The format is a it a bit of a departure from her norm too; she tells three separate stories that she attempts to link together at the end, but misses the mark. If you're an loyal fan, you'll probably be disappointed. However, if this is your first Keyes novel, you might like it. Funny, one of the characters in the book is an author who's second book is so very different from the first that her audience is disappointed. Much like I felt about this book. Always looking forward to the next one. I know Ms Keyes won't let me down..."
4,Spot on!,"Although this book started slowly for me, I was sucked into it (as I am with all Marian Keyes books) and couldnt put it down. I will be back for more! Good job Keyes!"
4,Entertaining and fun!,"This was an entertaining read. The only reason I gave it four stars is because it was slow to start for me...it really took me a while to care about the characters...but once I did, I was hooked! Keyes sure has a way of making the reader empathize with characters you would otherwise disdain in the real world. I was also sad that the ending wrapped up so quickly..."
1,regarding page 562,"Four stars for a great read but no stars for the line on page 562....""Like taking flying lessons from Osama Bin Laden""I love this book but I must pass some disappointment at this bad attempt at a joke. No matter how much time passes or on what continent you live, this is never funny. There will never be a time or a place to make jokes about 9/11."
2,Another disappointment,"Ms. Keyes is a very good writer. Watermelon, Lucy Sullivan, Last Chance Saloon, and especially Rachel's Holiday were very, very good. But Angels started a downward spiral, with each book getting worse. Sushi was lousy, Under the Duvet contributed nothing, and this book is simply a failure. I get the feeling her publishers are milking the cash cow too hard. Ms. Keyes: take some time to reread your early stuff. It was really, really good."
4,Fantastic -sad but happy and hopeful all at once,"This is my fave book by marian keyes.The characters are so likeable that when anton and lily split up i cried my little heart out, for an hour!She has such a talent to be able to get you not just liking the characters but loving them, and sometimes, although its quite embarrassing to say, not realising that they arent actually real people!Marian keyes is my favourite writer in this genre and as long as shes breathing and writing, i'll be reading!CONGRATS!!!PS THE ONLY REASON I DIDNT GIVE IT 5 STARS IS BECAUSE MARK AND JOJO DIDNT STAY TOGETHER!!! Nadine Grant"
4,All Ends Well...,"The same as all of the other Marian Keyes' books, you are not sure what turn the characters will take, but all ends nice and neat. I loved this book. It was great. A little predictable, but I think that is why I love Keyes' books so much anyway!It was a bit slow in the middle, but I couldn't wait to read the end!"
2,Major disappointment,"I always enjoy her books, even if they can be a bit frothy at times. This one--not so much. I found none of the characters particularly likeable; nor did they have any of the kindness and ironic view of life that her other characters did. When the negative things happen, it isn't so much of a surprise. What goes around, comes around indeed. These women are either so sweet as to be saccharine or so unbelievably hard that diamond could not scratch the surface. Not her best work, with very little of the signature humor that drew me to her books in the first place."
2,Save Your Keyes for Another,I am a great fan of Marian Keyes' ability as a writer but was disappointed with this attempt. A thread of a story line and overly dependent on a few witty remarks.Save your Keyes for Lucy Sulivan Gets married or Last Chance Salloon.
3,"Could be a light read, but sometimes dragged somewhat...","A bit difficult to continue on reading at some parts. (Somehow, sometimes, the 3 stories of these 3 women acquire the feeling of being saturated that one needs to take a break to digest all that was happening.) Was also a bit predictable at some level--while some events (especially in the lives of Gemma and of Lily) felt like they gave way to the burden of instilling some kind of happy-ending-for-all--that some twists in the middle of their lives were put on to scramble things about for the sake of a storyline, but in the end, it seemed that the author just said, ""Ahh...blimey...lemme put things back in order.""Still, there were precious moments of feeling and lightheartedness that made this novel a joy to read. The snappy, comic dialogues and mannerisms of Gemma, Jojo, and even Lily, as well as the other characters (Ema is such a darling), make them feel genuine people--the kind that you'd really want to get to know just a tad bit further."
3,Not as good as her other books,"I've read and loved every one of Marian Keyes' books until this one. Her books always provide great humor and a good story. Unfortunately, ""The Other Side of the Story"" is the first one that didn't warm my heart or cause me to laugh very much. I could not stand Lily, wasn't warmed to JoJo, and Gemma was the only saving character in the whole book. I gave it three stars because there is no 2.5 and a 2 seems too harsh."
3,"Entertaining, pleasant read - really 3.5-4 stars","I am a huge fan of women's lit and I think I have read every single one of Marian Keyes' books. Though some of them tend to be rather similar, and I didn't like all of them, this one was a more thoughtful, engaging read. I feel like I wanted to be friends with these women; Gemma, with her fun-loving-ness(and I wanted her to get her revenge); Lily, with her fragility and understandable vulnerability; and Jojo, with her go get'em attitude. I really give it 3.5-4 stars and I consider myself a rather harsh critic.I would definitely recommend this book for an airport read or a rainy day or just a pleasant weekend."
3,Great untill the end,"This is the first book I have read by Marian Keyes. I have to agree with the review written by Lilly Flora ""lsdstitch"" (Portland, OR), great until you get two thirds through, I became bored when everything became predictable. However I have not been put off reading more of her work. Over all worth reading if you like this genre, Don't hold your breath for a big finish."
4,Another Keyes Winner!,"I have always enjoyed Marian Keyes' books, so when i saw this one, i had to have it. i liked the way it started, the voice of Gemma hooked me! Then the middle seemed to drag a bit and i could only read about a chapter at a time, but the last third i could not put down! I loved the characters in this book, and enjoyed that they were all so far from perfect, but so real to me! I am giving it to my sister to read, and I am sure she will love it as much as I did. well developed characters and a great story!"
4,different,i liked this book . I was pleasantly surprised it was diffrent from the cliched chick lit which i cannot stomach. marian keyes is certainly a talented writer.
5,Awesome book,"This book was a fun read. Dont be turned off by its length, you wont be counting the pages. 2 out of the 3 main characters are just hysterical. I'm definitly happy I found this book."
2,Sushi is so much better for you,"After reading ""Sushi for Beginners"" I was looking forward to reading ""The other side of the story"" by Marian Keyes. Boy what a let down. Gemma Hogan is event organizer trying to deal with mom after her dad has left. Lily Wright stole Gemma boyfriend Anton and now she has Gemma boyfriend and the writing career that Gemma always wanted. Jojo Harvey is an american living in London working as literary agent, who is having affair with married boss. But soon these three woman lives are going to meet and who knows who will be left standing.I was really looking forward to this book, but I really didn't like it. All of the characters seem flat and uninteresting to me. I couldn't wait for it be over. ""Sushi for Beginners"" was so much better."
2,I'm tired of her writing,"I have a thing for popular Brit lit -- Sophie Kinsella, Helen Fielding, etc, an usual taste for a woman like me over 50. Keyes used to be on this list, but I just can't get through her stuff anymore. Since ANGELS, I find it too long, too trite, and too unengaging -- everything that people accuse chyck lit of but that Keyes used to transcend. I think I'm done with her."
3,Doesn't live up to the hype,"The premise of the book sounded fun and entertaining, but right off I was bored. The whole storyline about Gemma's parents was just plain old annoying, and Gemma's e-mails weren't exactly the hysterically witty writings of someone who'd land a book deal because of them. They were long and boring. The introduction of JoJo was a welcome reprieve from Gemma's slow and tedious story, but overall, the three women in the story were verging on annoying (ok, Gemma and Lily WERE annoying). Must chick lit contain weak female characters? Do they have to pine away for schmucky guys? Can't they be intelligent women who do stupid things like the rest of us without being so one dimensional? Keyes lost me on this one."
4,Brilliant read,"Loved this book. had a very fresh theme and could not put it down. Jojo character was one you were rooting for all the way through the book, shame she didn't get back together with Mark in the end, - im a sucker for happy endings! The Gemma-anton-lily storyline was a little unrealistic yet very entertaining and i would definetely recommend this book to anyone who just likes to read and chill! can't wait for the next one!"
4,Fun Summer Reading!,"This is a very fun and easy read, and the kind of book that keeps you turning the pages. It moves very quickly so you always want to know what's going to happen next. I thought it was a fun book to read, and I found myself identifying with each of the very likeable characters. This book will make you laugh and may even (sniff) make you shed a tear. Bottom line: very cute story! You'll have a blast reading this!"
2,Wake me when we get to the other side,"ZZZZZZZZZ...morning already? Yikes,this book was a snore. I have recently decided to give up finishing books, even by authors I love, when they put me to sleep rather than lull me there. Too many of today's ""chick-lit"" authors have run out of gas without a filling station in sight. Time to find some new, fresh voices out there in Bookland, I guess... I hope they ARE out there."
1,Not Impressed,"I didn't even finish this book. I don't like to leave a book, but for some reason, I was very bored and just couldn't get into this one at all."
5,Simply fabulous!,"I have read all of Marian Keyes's novels, some were better than the others, so far my favourite being ""Rachel's Holiday"" and my least favourite ""Angels"" (that, actually, was a veeery big disappointment). But, thank God, Miss Keyes is back on track, in fact I think this is her best book ever! Simply fabulous. Funny, but not shallow and concentrated on the laughs only. This novel contains a lot of insights into our lives and tells the tale of how it is not so easy to be a woman in today's world, dealing with stressful career, needy parents and all kind of emotional drama. But the heroines manage it and after reading it, strangely comforted, I came to the conclusion that, hey, I will manage too:-). Many thanks to Marian Keyes, please don't ever stop writing!"
3,Is she losing her touch?,Oh dear! I have loved every single one of Keyes previous books and I had high hopes for this one to be as witty and capture me in its world the same way. But after a few hundred pages I started to wonder if the book was even written by the same author as the previous ones. It didn't quite hold together and I didn't like any of the three characters. The threesome idea didn't work like it did in Sushi for Beginners and it left all three characters quite shallow altogether. I hope Keyes will reach her level of writing again in her next novel. Waiting eagarly for Under the duvet 2!
3,For what it is worth...,I thought the book had a very nice plot and complex characters. The story flowed fairly easy but I have to admit that it changed characters in midstream at times without any warning or announcement. There were times that I found myself rereading the passage to ensure clarity. It won't be a book that I read again for pleasure but it was a nice one time read. Thank you.
4,The Other Side of the Story,"I really enjoyed reading 'The Other Side of the Story'... Once I'd got over the confusing jump between 3 characters, I found it easy to get into and at times a hard book to put down.I did feel frustrated at times with 'Gemma' as she seemed very promising at the start of the book, but seemed to be overtaken by the other two characters. A book worth reading, even if the ending does seem a bit rushed!"
5,Marian Keys Rocks !!!!,"Once again, another book that you can't put down. I tore through it in two days. Any book from Marian Keyes is guaranteed an excellent read and I admit that I have been addicted to her books since accidentally coming accross ""Watermelon"" in a library one day."
2,overrated.,"I found the characters, despite being on different ""sides"" of the story, to be unlikeable. I struggled to empathize as all of the female characters had a tendancy to revel in their own depression and patheticness. We all have struggles, I didn't find these characters' lives particularly aweful or challegngin.I prefer a stronger, more self motivated and positive heroine. The ending was somewhat predictable and unsatisfying. I finished it purely out of obligation."
1,Disappointing and terribly boring,"I finished this book simply because I hate giving up on a book partway through. I acknowledge that my frustration is my own fault for not just letting go and putting the book down.""The Other Side of the Story"" was painfully slow to start up. The first, oh, ten? chapters were so incredibly boring, full of cliche and faux-quirk that I thought I might throw the book out the window. As I plowed through, what the author intended as quirkiness for her characters (and never managed to pull off) became either flat-out boring, ridiculous, or borderline insane.I really enjoyed a few of Marian Keyes' other books, and I had hoped to like this one, but it was a massive waste of time."
3,Not as good as her previous work,"The only thing that hasn't been touched on about the book that annoyed me is the character JoJo's linguistics. The character supposedly grew up in the U.S. and moved to Britain as an adult, yet when she is speaking casually, she ALWAYS uses the British word for something instead of the American. She's wearing a ""frock"", not a dress. She lives in a ""flat"", not an apartment, etc. I doubt that someone who lived in America well into adulthood would use those words in every day conversation, even if they live in Britain."
5,"My first, but certainly not my last, Marian Keyes book","I picked up this book by chance, while waiting for a delayed flight at the airport. What wonderful luck it was! This book is delightful! I actually laughed at loud while sitting in that stuffy airport and it made my delay so much more bearable. It is the first book I have read by Marian Keyes and now I am dying to get ahold of others she has written. Buy this book, I know you will love it!"
2,Disappointing.,"This fixture may seem smaller than you think once installed. I think it would be ok if you have other or multiple lights like on a path along a wall. But if you're going to use it as your ""porch light"" it should be the back porch and it should be mounted rather low. Otherwise you may be disappointed. It's kind of small and non-impressive so using it as main entry light I would not recommend. Also, most bulbs will tend to be seen from the bottom. It's too short. And most of the light will be from the bottom. The photo shown WILL NOT happen. The bottom of the fixture will be lit brightly, while the top panes of glass will get little light. Overall, even though I give it a 3, I find it to be typical junk you find nowadays. I bought an arts and crafts style light at Lowe's for $65 and like it MUCH more. This ""American Mission"" went to the back porch and will probably be replaced later."
3,Action Fun To Watch--Hate English Dub,"Also known as Hero Among Heroes, this is a fun little movie. The most disappointing thing was that it was not in Cantonese with subtitles. Fans who want to see a little of Donnie's silly side, in addition to his amazing kung fu, will not be let down. Donnie is great as So Chai. There is a scene with Donnie vs. Hair?? Funny! Drunken Fist, and also well done serious scene of So Chai withdrawing from opium.I could have done without the buck-toothed aunt, but I have a feeling it was funnier in Cantonese. I agree with another review who stated that Once Upon A Time in China 2, Wing Chun, or Iron Monkey were the best films from this period of collaboration between Yen and Yuen Woo Ping."
3,Speed-vision,"There are two big no-no's for me when it comes to martial arts movies. 1) Sped-up fight scenes, 2) wire-fu. This movie has both. Donnie Yen movies seem to always have fast-forward fight scenes, which cheapens the experience. The plot of this movie is very similar to The Prodigal Son (which is a better film in my opinion). I just can't get past the gravity defying movies. I prefer on-the-ground martial arts fighting. So, I give this movie three stars for Donnie's acting and dock two stars for the fight scenes and wire work. If you buy the Columbia/Sony Pictures version be aware there's no original language, only English dub. The woman that does the dub for the aunt in this film has such a grating voice you want to fast forward through it. And what's with the fake buck teeth?"
2,Don't be fooled by the cool name,"This sounds great and looks great but the movie is laughable. I would only give this 1.5 stars if the option was available. This is a goofy, clumsy film that is not new by any means. Not that it has to be new to be good. I am a huge Donnie Yen fan but wow, what a disappointment.. Save your cash. Buy Chocolate instead....the movie, not the candy."
2,There are many kung-fu movies out there that are better,"If you want to see 'old-school' Kung Fu, then get the classic Shaw Brothers movies starring Gordon Liu and others.If you want to see the more modern approach, check out the ""Once Upon A Time In China"" films produced by Tsui Hark and which star Jet Li. The OUATIC series has better acting and much more interesting and inventive fight scenes. The comic relief is also handled much more deftly.I even found Iron Monkey which has the same director and stars to be a better film. Don't waster your time - there are better movies out there!"
2,"Potential, but...","Woo Ping really can't direct. I absolutely love his fight choreography, but this is one awful movie. I just wasn't able to get past the terrible sound quality, acting, and sheerly baffling moments in the script. Do yourself a favor and don't see this one."
3,read,pay no attention to my rating !!I haven't watched this one yet but BE WARNED THIS MOVIE IS IN SUBTITLE.
3,Fist of The Red Dragon,This movie appeared to be o.k. A lot of action. Story's seemed to be confusing. Donnie Yen has recently become a rising kung-fu star. I enjoy his movies. It's fun and entertaining.
3,"KISS Unauthorized: A ""Backstage"" View","KISS: Unauthorized is a must-own for KISS fanatics. Although there are few clips of KISS performing live, this DVD is loaded with cool footage of the band (the late lineup: Gene Simmons, Paul Stanley, Bruce Kulick, and Eric Singer, and the original lineup: Gene, Paul, Peter Criss, and Ace Freliley) at record signings, on TV shows being interviewed, at the conventions, and even setting up for a performance. Some great moments are Ace Freliey's induction into the Rock and Roll walk of fame, and KISS appearing outside in full makeup and costume for a 'press conferrence.' Definitely worth seeing, but probably not something you'd watch many, many times!"

3,60 minute semi-documentary,"Just a smattering of seemingly random clips. Having never seen Vinnie Vincent in any clips I found it interesting & entertaining for the short amount of time that this ran. If I was to complain, I'd want more for my money. I would want more bonus material, music, liner material. If I spend [$$] I just dont want a single 55 minute segment with nothing much more."
4,Its about the people BEHIND the music....,"OK, So its not full of KISS tunes! You want tunes, buy a CD or a concert video! This is an interesting snapshot into the guys as they are. The people behind the makeup and rock&roll. Particularly, glimpses into Eric Carr. Very good"
3,It was ok...,"I wouldn't put this in my top 10 favorite Kiss productions, I have always been a fan of concert footage, and this movie has none whatsoever. This was a gamble for me, because there were no reviews when I looked at it. It has a lot of interesting stuff in it, a very long interview from the Alive III time period, and the induction of Ace and Peter into the Rockwalk of Fame, and just some other miscellaneous snippets from the years. It's good for a hardcore collector, but if you want concert stuff, don't buy it."
1,a little smaller than expected.,I thought this product would be a little longer and noticed that the front of the scooper( triangle shaped) is kind of flimsy. I don't know if it will pick up heavy litter. After trying this product it is not made for scoop types of litter. It would not separate the clean from the dirty litter. I would not buy it again. It is just wasting space and I will probably give it to goodwill.
1,"Flimsy, very small holes","I thought this would be a great scooper for my cats, who like to pee in the corners. But the triangle piece at the end was extremely flimsy. In addition, the holes were so small that my clumping litter wouldn't fall through it without lots and lots of shaking. Overall, I thought this scooper was a neat idea, but poorly executed."
1,"This product is lousy,period.","This product is lousy, period. it bends all over when you you are trying to clean the litter, it is just totally useless."
5,A must for printmakers,"This is a fantastically detailed book presenting a variety of relief printmaking methods. The book covers the basics, and a few color illustrations of 50's and 60' Japanese relief prints. It has an incredible chapter on how to make your own baren, taught by Shokichi Kobayashi. When this book was printed in 1965, he was one of only a few people who still had the skill and knowledge to make a traditional baren using methods developed over 400 years ago. The 6 artists this book covers are Umetaro Azechi, Hideo Hagiwara, Sho Kidokoro, Hiroyuki Tajima, and Hodaka Yoshida. The details provided for each artist are step by step directions on carving, printing, and their own unique methods for relief printmaking, with step by step photographs. This is an excellent teaching tool for advanced printmakers. This books is equal to ""Evolving Techniques in Japanese Woodblock Prints,"" by Petit/Arboleda. An amazing and excellent resource."
3,like me in a way,i have to say that in a way she is like mebesides the part of the dad leaving she is.i have meny problems in my life and the way i getrid of them i write poetry. it may sound strange butit gets all of my anger and emotions out.it helps having it down on paper. i think she mighthave felt this way in the movie but that is from mypoint of veiw.
2,"If for the Clie, better BE for the Clie","Very very well made, but NOT for the clie. The Clie may fit it but the Clie has buttons that stick out ABOVE the surface. In this case the fit is so tight the buttons are pressed constantly and the Clie stays on until it runs out of power. It was a waste of money for carrying my Clie. It is now doing (very expensive) duty as a second layer of protection for my Ipod Classic which resides in a clear plastic case.It was very clear that the manufacturer NEVER really tested the Sony Clie SJ 22 in this leather case. Some of the Sony PDA's are quite fine in this case like the t615 with recessed buttons and it would be good for them, just NOT the SJ22."
4,Girl Motorcycle Club as Hard as they came,Biker action movie with a definite twist! Good to see the gals win once in a while!
2,Gunslick Universal Bore Guide,Cheap product. It will not last very long. I received the shipment promptly. I don't think I will use it.
4,Works well but plastic collar lock not durable,"This is a great product to protect the head-space/ chamber area of your gun from cleaning rod rub. The bore guide keeps the solvent and brush splatter from the chamber area as well. I like accurate guns & would not want to damage the ""Lands"" area of the barrel. There are better quality products out there, but this does help. It would help to have the locking/adjustable collar to be made of aluminum as opposed to plastic. This does add a step to cleaning, but will produce long term benefits like keeping your favorite rifle(s) performing properly."
4,We are all going there aren't we ? Ethernet in some way.,"This little pocket-sized book gives you a very swift and easy introduction into the field of Industrial Ethernet and it keeps enough depth in those parts where it is needed. I recommend this book to everyone that wants the basic knowledge about Industrial Ethernet and TCP/IP, from maintenance-personnel to new developers that needs a head-start into this field. The book will continuously work as a reference guide as well.bravo"
1,Saccharine where Heidi was sweet,"Tritten was Johanna Spyri's translator, a fact that he makes much of in his introduction to his sequels to her great novel Heidi. This was the second sequel that he published (the first being _Heidi Grows Up_).In _Heidi's Children_ Heidi is pregnant with her first child and at the same time agrees to take on the problem sister of a good friend. Heidi teaches this child an important lesson about life and at the same time unravels a complex family secret.Spyri's works were simple and strong, and their goodness and sweetness shone through the pages. Tritten is not nearly as talented as a writer, and his sequels are a sad distortion of the characters. He cakes on religion and sentimentality and uses that as plot. He makes the characters into pious charactatures of their original incarnations.Skip these, unless you're a Spyri scholar."
2,just so-so,I am not impressed and niether is my daughter... my son likes the idea but not amazed either by the distance it flies.
1,PIECE OF CRAP!,"I BOUGHT THIS PARTICULAR DOLL/TOY FOR MY YOUNGEST DAUGHTER AND WITHIN A FEW HOURS, THE STRING WAS BROKEN! IT WAS EITHER STUCK, UNABLE TO PULL FROM THE BASE, OR UNABLE TO RECOIL AFTER ""FLIGHT"". OTHERWISE, THERE WAS SOME ENJOYMENT WHEN IT WORKED, IF ONLY FOR A MOMENT. I WAS JUST REMINDED BY MY TEEN DAUGHTER THAT SHE RECEIVED HERS AS A GIFT AND IT DID THE SAME THING, ABOUT 10 YEARS AGO! APPARENTLY THE MANUFACTURER DOESN'T CARE TO IMPROVE THE PRODUCT. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
2,Misleading title,"Unfortunately, the title of this book has little to do with its content. If you're looking for nitty gritty details on tax strategies for active stock traders, you'll be disappointed to find only one chapter that comes close.Tesser provides useful tax advice for the general taxpayer, which makes me wonder why he did not call the book something like, ""Beating the IRS After Tax Reform."" Odds are the publisher wanted to take advantage of the boom in daytrading and online brokerages."
2,Save your money,One would be better served by spending the money on a visit to a tax investment professional. The book may help with general tax guidelines. It is not a how to guide nor did the author intend to be. It is written in an entertaining fashion and that is why I'm giving it the second star.
2,Where's the Beef?,"This book should be titled, "" The Investor's Tax Primer: A Basic Reader."" There are no fewer than 47 exhibits consisting of blank IRS forms occasionally referenced in the text. This reader was left with the impression that the author did not have much to say regarding a ""trader's"" perspective on taxation. The author did, however, add a liberal sprinkling of his political views and heavy endorsement of the tax planning profession. If you are new to finances or have never actually seen a tax form, then this book is for you. If you are an experienced trader with a basic knowledge of taxation, you will find a few useful tables and an interesting chapter or two. No one should expect tax advice specific to his or her own financial situation in a book of this nature. In sum, this book has a few useful tidbits, but is not accurately titled or described."
1,Disappointed!,"When I ordered these it was a 144 bulk pack, when I recieved them they came as a 12 pack. When I called co. they said sorry it was an advertisement error and there was nothing that they would do about it. I was supposed to receive a refund and to this day, over a month later I'm STILL waiting!!!"
4,Even a lesser Bergman is a good picture.,"In addition to two fine reviews, let me add that the misogynist plot (Peter hates his wife Katrina but kills a prostitute instead) and the incessant recording (done by the investigator, the psychiatrist, and the murderer himself) draw our attention to the one gay man. Tim is a person who does not want to record what he has to say and who, although nearly everyone knows the imminent danger intuitively and disregards it, chooses to look himself in the mirror and recognizes the horror of both what he has done and not done. Yet we don't care when Katrina acknowledges his shallowness despite his hand upon her cheek. Since we don't care about Tim, how are we to care whether Peter ever found him? Consequently, Peter's anguish remains vague and we're left grateful he's locked up--not typical for Bergman who more often yearns for escape."
2,Not their best work,"A bit of a disappointment when compared to the humor of previous albums, although some of the covers are amusing simply in the way they're performed, the album just falls short of expectations. If you're a fan of songs like 36D, Mother's Pride, Good As Gold Stupid As Mud this isn't for you."
4,thoroughly enjoyable,"Hey folks, this is a cover albums; a light-hearted but sincere effort at covering a bunch of very cool tunes that Paul Heaton and his mates no doubt like very much. I found the album to be thoroughly enjoyable. Maybe it won't rank up there with the ""classic"" The Beautiful South albums that longtime fans adore, but this is still a very sold collection of tunes. Listen, sing along, and smile!"
3,A Mixed Bag,"This covers CD from England's acerbic popmeisters The Beautiful South is a mixed bag. Golddiggas, Headnodders & Pholk Songs features radically reworked versions of tunes made popular by Blue Oyster Cult (""Don't Fear the Reaper""), ELO (""Living Thing""), and, uh, John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John (""You're the One That I Want""). The further from the original conception, the more successful the remake. ""Living Thing"" is a music hall shuffle. ""Don't Fear the Reaper"" is a sophisticated salsa that would have fit on Joe Jackson's Night and Day. The Ramones' ""Blitzkrieg Bop"" is just shy of a country rave up. And ""You're the One That I Want"" finds the dark side of Grease while still celebrating the enduring power of love. After that, it depends on how much cheek you can stomach. I've got a stronger gut than most."
2,Nothing much left to say?,"What ever happend to the people who wrote ""Rottardam"" and ""Perfect 10""? Have they grown tired of writing excellent verse in a sharp musical package? Did they take the final plunge into the very world they were writing about from a cynical distance and turned themselves into gargoyles with red underwear?I don't know, maybe other people can listen to this album and smile pleasntly from under a warm blanket with a cup of tea, but me, I expected a little more acid in my cup when it comes the Beautiful South..."
1,Western Civilization,"The description of this book was horrible. I thought I was ordering the actual textbook and instead received the workbook. Also, it wasn't even the workbook to the textbook that had been described on the site."
3,Factually correct. Almost,"This book started out looking really good. It is full of some of the best pictures of BMW 5-series cars I have seen in a single collection.However, by the time they get onto the E39 cars, things begin to fall apart. The book becomes factually incorrect. Some of the humdingers include:1) ""All E39 cars came equipped with electric seats"". Bolox. Not correct. I have driven two German built cars that had manual seat adjustment2) The gear selector is moved to the right on right hand drive cars to select manual mode. Rubbish. They all move to the left.It goes on and on...Also, being published in 1999, it stops at the launch of the M5. There must be newer, better books available on this subject."
4,Incomplete Story,"The book title is incorrect because the story contained within is not complete. There is no mention of the different styles of ventilation control housings underneath the center of the dash panels, in E28 5 series BMW. Illustrations on pages 75, 80 and 96 show different styles E28 vent control and a/c housings, however there is no mention of these differences in any of the text. Appropriate additions should be included in all future editions of an otherwise excellent 5er book."
5,"A+ Video, from Science Teacher","My wife uses this video to entice her 4th graders to participate in her school's Science Fair. She says that it is a wonderful tool to spark their ideas and to get them thinking about what types of experiments they might be interesed in conducting. Also, this video is great because kids really can do the experiments with little adult input."
1,PIECE OF CRAP!!!,"I BOUGHT THIS DOLL/TOY FOR MY DAUGHTER YESTERDAY. IT ONLY TOOK A FEW HOURS FOR IT TO BREAK. THE STRING IS EITHER UNABLE TO BE PULLED FROM THE BASE OR UNABLE TO RECOIL AFTER ""FLIGHT"". I MUST SAY, AFTER READING SOME OF THE REVIEWS ABOUT HOW FAULTY THE RELIABILITY IS OF THIS TOY, I DECIDED TO PURCHASE ANYWAY (MY DAUGHTER REALLY WANTED IT) BUT IN RETROSPECT, I AM SORRY I DIDN'T TAKE HEED. WHY DON'T WE ALL WRITE LETTERS TO THE MANUFACTURER, PERHAPS THIS WILL IMPROVE THE PRODUCT, OR AT LEAST WARN THE MAKER TO WATCH HIS/HER BACK IN THE PRESENCE OF THE CONSUMERS THEY HAVE DUPPED!"
1,String Broken in Minutes,"My daughter got this for her birthday today, played with it with it for a few minutes--it seemed like a fun toy. Then the string broke in minutes. My daughter cried and I spent the next half hour trying to fix it.David"
2,Lasted less than a day.,"This toy was high on my daughter's Christmas list. It broke after less than a day of intermittent use. My five year old was extremely upset when the flimsy rip cord broke, rendering her Christmas present useless."
2,Couldn't keep a 3-yr old's interest,"My 3-year old daughter has a hard time making this toy fly on her own. She got it for her 3rd birthday and has only played with it twice (during the first week of getting it). It seems durable and works well, but it hasn't gotten much use. There just isn't much play value. The commercial made her want it, but it doesn't hold her interest."
1,Kids lose interest quickly,"My 4 year old daughter saw this on TV, but when we got it she played with it for about 5 minutes. It is hard to use, and it is not for kids under the age of 5 becasue of the strength it takes to make it work."
2,Not worth it!,"My five year old daughter received this toy for Christmas, played with it once, then decided it was too hard to wind up and put it away. It doesn't do anything except fly up, and even then it is really difficult to get it to fly properly."
1,SkyDancers are the Plain Janes of the Doll Universe,"I remember back when I turned 8, I got a SkyDancers doll for my birthday. At first I had fun playing around and shooting it in the air, but then it would drop and either break something or hurt someone, so I was forced to play it outside, where it got very dirty (ick!) Also, the wings on my doll were foamy, and they wore down. They weren't removable, so this doll couldn't be used for playing with barbies or anything. She pretty much spins in the air and voila, that's it! That's all she does! When I was a kid, I got bored after a day it's been rotting in my toybox since. Oh, and know why the SkyDancers are the plain janes of the doll universe? Because they don't have long, beautiful hair to comb, and their faces are as plain as those of a Happy Meal Barbie. Skip it!Erm, that is all.CHOW! And don't touch the sushi.XOXOXO,Roxanne"
5,At Last!,At last The Glory Guys in widescreen! I bought the VHS pan and scan version years ago and always hoped it would be released as is it should be. This has been a favorite movie of mine since I was a kid and saw it on TV back in the sixties. Tom Tryon Harve Presnell and Senta Berger round out a great cast including a young Wayne Rodgers and James Caan. Good movie!
4,The Glory Guys,"This is a rip roaring western starring Tom Tryon and Harve Presnell, two of my fave actors! Both of these gentlemen were naturals and neither were given enough credit in their careers. This movie is a chance to see both at the height of their fame, and it is well worth the viewing. It is a cavalry movie...nuff said."
4,Haunting a horse through a Dark meadow,"I know that is a random statement, but it pretty much sums up the way I feel about The Besnard Lakes debut album. After reading the credentials of Jace Lasek one half of the husband and wife duo, I was expecting the kind of quirky indie rock that Canada has been churning out for years now. Instead I got a ethereal punch to the skull. This album shimmers like the brightest star while at the same time pulling you into a dark quicksand that loves you and your misery. This one is a hard one to put your finger on. It douses you in majesty while making you feel a little dirty. An album of infinite contradictions. So bite down on the horse bit and don't drown in this lake of secrets."
5,A very useful tool for studying the language,"I am a professional language teacher. I usualy read on my Kindle, but this title has some extra features that I really like when I read it on my iPhone.I can listen to the dialogues while reading the book by simply tapping on the icons. The I can read along while I listen.I think this is a great tool for students of unfamilar languages. I also like the Teach Yourself series of language books in general, although there are a couple of titles I don't own (yet)."
4,Kira-Kira,This is a great book for ages 12 and up. Thisbook is sad and also entertaining. There are meany themes to this book. One of the themes of this book is don't take your life for granted. I connected with Lynn because she has a friend that makes her laugh. The setting of this book is in Iowa and in Georgia. I liked this book because it is intresting and I did not want to stop reading it. The plot of this story is realy intresting. It's a story about two Japanese girls moving from Iowa to Georgia. There where not a lot of parts i did not like. One part I did not like is when Lynn and Katie climbed on top of there roof and threw kleenx into the wind. I did not like this part becauce it was not really that important to the story. This book is good for people 12 and up. This book will draw you in. You can't stop reading this book because it is so good!
3,"Wonderfully Visual, But Something Was Just Missing....","Kira-Kira is a book that sweeps you in from the very beginning because it is effortlessly visual. The author has a wonderful grasp of the natural and how to convey things in an expert style. I give her 5/5 stars for her writing style, but the book was missing a certain ""depth"" to it. I read through it in about 1-2 days and find that it left something to be desired. I don't know if anyone else felt this, but I did.There were also some things I didn't like about the book. The main thing being that everything seemed to revolve around Lynn (I get that certain ""circumstances"" happen to Lynn in the the book, but I wanted Katie to get more of the focus). Finally, Katie needed more defining moments and deeper introspection. A good book leaves me thinking about it for days, this one left with the breeze with no signs of being ""kira-kira""..."
1,Disappointing,"I expect more from a book with this great award. It had a lot of unnecessary adult content that was totally uncalled for in a book marketed to children. The sisters love for each other was sweet and their relationship was portrayed well, but that was not enough to make this a good book."
4,This is a Great book!!=),"The book Kira-Kira is very interesting. It is about a 10 year old girl who loves her older sister, Lynn very much! Kaity goes through some hard situations in her life, but Lynn helps her through most of them. When Lynn gets very sick Kaity, Sammy (their yonger brother) and their parents start to worry. To know what happens in the rest of the book you will just have to read this AWESOME BOOK!!I think this book was really fun to read! It teaches you life lessons and holds your attention. I recommend this book for ages 10 and up. If you love to read you should read this GREAT book!!Review from Toki Student, Madison WI."
4,I LOVED THIS BOOK,"I really enjoyed this book. I felt really bad for Katie when she had to move from her home that she grew up in and how her parents were losing all of their money. Then she became the third wheel whenever her sister Lynn brought her friend Amber along.I would love to say more, but I don't want to give anything away. Overall this was a wonderful book and I enjoyed a lot."
3,Not really for kids,"Kadohata is a very good writer - especially when it comes to characterization. This story is touching and well-told. That said, this is really not a children's book - it is written in memoir style and probably best understood by adult readers. The treatment of Japanese Americans in the workplace, death of a sibling, unionization, and a reference to parental sexual activity can be overwhelming material for children. Perhaps the Newbery terms & criteria need to be adjusted, maybe 0-12 is a better age group for children's lit awards"
5,Loved it!,"I loved tis book! Is was unique, sad, and so well written. This book shouldn't get just a 5 star it should get a 10,000 rating stars! He book was awesome!"
5,kira-kira,Kira-Kira is a marvelous book. We learn about her struggles with her life. Her older sister Lynn is very sick. Her younger brother is very young. She is left in charge of her siblings. This is a fantastic book about her struggles.
2,So-So,"This book didn't really stand out in any major way. I've read far more interesting books. Sure, it had a nice ending. It's important to note, though, the difference between the recommended ages (11-14) and the Accelerated Reader level of 4.7. Language and a couple of mentions of sex and dating might not be what the 4.7 level child needs to read. So, while it might be an interesting story, it's important to note the appropriateness."
3,Kira-kira,"I think this book was very good because of its ending. In the beginning it wasn't all that interesting. The ending had events that happened quickly then the beginning. I really like how they described the look in Lynn s eyes before she died then what Katie knew she was thinking about. I also liked the part about the picnic they had. I recommend this book to girls more then boys, and for young teens."
3,"Entertaining, but didactic and sentimental","This book may help young people to learn about an experience unlike their own (for example, the experience of being a racial/cultural minority in America, the experience of having parents who work in an industrial setting so severe that they are not permitted time to visit a restroom, or the horrific experience of having a sibling pass away). However - although this book is sensitively written - it seems that with all these situations, the net result is somewhat contrived and perhaps something that reviewers may have felt children *ought* to value or enjoy. Regrettably, many novels ""for children"" tend to be overly didactic or sentimental. I - as a grown-up - was entertained by this book, but as a child or a teen, I might have been put off if assigned by a teacher to read it."
3,A sad book,"I enjoyed reading Kira-Kira. I gave it 3 out of 5 stars because it could be a little dull at times. Other times it was pretty exciting. It's about Katie and Lynne, who are sisters and best friends. When they move from Iowa to Georgia, their friendship is put to the test. Especially when Lynne gets sick, and becomes very irritable. It's a sad book with a bittersweet ending. I recommend this book if you're not looking for anything funny.A 6th Grader From Madison"
5,KIra-Kira,"Cynthia Kadohata's kira-kira is a very well written book , its humourous and at times sad definaltly worth reading for anyone of any age"
3,"Depressing, no where near as kid friendly as Despereaux","Another children's book for adults. It's well written, but slow moving. It's told in an older voice looking back on the time when she was a child. How many depressing themes can a writer fit into one small book? Moving, racism, poor working conditions, terminal illness, death. If you have to read a Newbery book, pick up Shiloh by Phyllis Naylor or Tale of Despereaux by Kate DiCamillo."
2,That Newbery award is not Kira-Kira,"If you've ever read a real Newbery book, you can see that Kira-Kira is one of the hugest dissapointments ever. The plot is dull, long and can get very boring. i usually like Newbery books, but this was terrible. Kira Kira was surely a book that should have won the Newbady award. Of course, i really liked that rare relationship between Katie and Lynn, but I hated Lynn for going off with Amber and Gregg. Kira-Kira is anything but glittering."
2,Not Newbery Caliber,"The story is well-written, but there is a large amount of prose that I don't think a lot of children will stick with. There are also some heavy themes of sickness, peer pressure, and prejudice. Also, parents and teachers, be careful before you choose this one for a read aloud or as a novel to teach. There are numerous, and known, curse words that will have your children and students looking at you like, ""Why'd you choose this one for us to read?"""
3,A Very Slow Read....,"I hate to sound flip, but the best thing about this book is its beautiful cover. I found the voice of the narrator occasionally charming, but mostly flat. There is a difference between simple and moronically simplistic. The plot is also dreadfully slow.Alas, I fear the Newbury should have gone to a more worthy novel."
2,A Newbery failure,"Okay, I don't get it, how the Newbery Committee comes up with its winners. This book is long, dull, and grinding. I'm angry about this selection. The writing is nice, but writing doesn't make a story. I can say that I read two to three books that should've won EVERYTHING, unlike this one. Most of all, The Willoughby Spit Wonder, by Jonathon Fuqua, is funny, sad, uplifting, and an absolutely great work that should be in every bookstore. Come on, isn't the Newbery supposed to find works for young adults, not adults? They need to do their work and find books that excite us. Kira-Kira doesn't. So, go out and find your own masterpieces. I've found mine and highly recommend it. You can no longer count of the Newbery Committee to come up with the books we want."
2,Not very kira-kira,"I've read many of the Newbery award books. I've loved them all-until Kira-Kira. It's the story of a poor Japanese family who move from Iowa to Georgia so their parents can work. The parents work all the time, and then, to make it worse, the narrator's sister, Lynn gets sick and dies. It's depressing and isn't helped by the fact that the narrator, Katie, is very uninteresting and flat. There are plenty more GOOD Newberys out there. Go get them instead. (Tale of Despereaux ROCKS!)"
3,Not-for-bedtime-story,"I still read my 8-year old bedtime stories. This gives me the chance to spend extra time with her, as well as to introduce her to books she wouldn't choose for herself but would nevertheless enjoy (e.g. Gogol's ""Evenings on a Farm in Dikanka"").I bought ""Kira Kira"" with the intention of reading at bedtime, but reading it myself made me decide to put it on the shelf for a least another few years. No, I don't believe in shielding my children from all grief and sadness. However, dumping depressing stories on my daughter as she drifts off into dreamland seems sadistic. It's not that the book is not engaging or well written, it's that the book is not appropriate for an 8-year old. I'll suggest it to her when she's a teen."
4,Kira-Kira is really great!,"At first, ""Kira-Kira"" didn't really seem like a good book. But when I began to read it, I couldn't put the book down! As good as it is, it is sad at the end. It is a really good book, and most likely someone else will find that it is a really good book!With everything going on in the book, the protagoniost, Katie, goes through ups and downs. Life is easy for her then it's unbareable. That's what I liked in the book, it seemed that it was someone's real life that Katie was living because she has good times and bad times.I would recommend this book for anyone 11 and up. I think it is four stars because of what happens in the end. It is a really great book, and I hope whoever reads it next will enjoy it as much as I did!"
4,A Worthy Newbery But Not the Best of Them,"Right off the top I want to say that you can never really go wrong with a Newbery Award winner. I've read nearly all of them and I've never been disappointed, even as I head into the second half of my fourth decade. Any book that's good enough for your children should be good enough for you too.That being said, this is not one of my favorites among the Newbery's. Kadohata is excellent at convincingly telling this story from the point of view of a young child and this story of Japanese-Americans struggling to get by in the deep South with a very ill child is a good one; however, I felt very much like I knew where this story was going and I occasionally felt my emotions were being manipulated by the author. I wept the required tears but I didn't feel satisfied.Still, I'm fond of the occasional tear-jerker and, if you are too, then this book is a good place to go."
3,an ok game,"This game is a marginal game. There are a couple of levels that are recon only, which I didn't like. They didn't tell you where to place the bug, so I spent an unbelievable amount of time in this one house. The only thing that made it worthwhile is I knew the floor plan by memory when I shot up the place 2 levels later. I got the cheat codes and skipped the next recon level. I've never been able to program the computer men to do anything useful, even after beating the entire game. The menu offers a huge number of weapons to choose from, too many really. It's hard to tell the difference. On the plus side, most of the levels are fun. I think Medal of Honor is a much better game."
4,Rogue Spear Speared Me,Rogue Spear is good on the playstation but is excellent on the computer. The first Tom Clancy Rainbow Six that came out was poor for the playstation but was great for the pc. In the playstation version of the first rainbow six the controls were complicated and the movement of the player was terrible. Rogue Spear has improved a tiny bit on the controls. Overall rogue spear is better than the the original rainbow six for both the pc and the playstation. I reccomed renting this game for the playstation but buying it for the pc.
1,Horrible game!!!,I rented this game and it had some of the worst gameplay I have ever seen. If you are not a really good gamer you might have difficulty beating the game.
1,Bad Choice,"Who ever thinks this game is great has never played the Syphon Filter series. The game has fair graphics, yet lacks in so much. The aiming goes for you (which I don't mind TOO much) but one or two shots and you're dead. Go a little too far around the corner by trying to see what's ahead and you die. This game was WAY below my expectations and I am sick of it. If you want a good shooter with some real content and fun, get the Syphon Filter series. If you want a challenging, every move you have to think about game, get SWAT 3 (except it's for computers)"
3,"SOUNDS THROWN TOGETHER, AND UNISPIRED","I really liked their second effort 'Situation Dangerous' , but this one is just missing something (namely compositions, and good ideas).The final cut is pretty good, but the rest sounds like it was created on the spot and is missing a spark . They're all good musicians , but that's not enough here.I think if they took some time to develop ideas they could be a supergroup .If you want inspired improvisation get 'Liquid Tension Experiment' similar concept with much better results, or 'Situation Dangerous'. I give it 3 stars based on pure musical ability."
2,"CLINICAL - ""STUNT GUITAR""","TECHNICAL PLAYING : 10 POINTS - PASSION : 0 POINTSBeing a lover of fine playing from a Prog / Jazz rock basis - I was recomended this CD :- Bozzio - I love UK and Zappa Levin - Love his work with Gabriel etc.. Stevens - The best thing about Billy Idols CDs....However, found this CD very cold and clinical - Its as if the artists wanted to prove just how technically good they are but somewhere lost the passion to actually ""say something"" in with their playing.For lovers of flash technical playing only ... I sent it back"
5,Flawless,"If you love king krimsen, spira gyra, return to forever, Jeff beck, Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, etc....get this now. but if you are a Bozzio fan, get this yesterday. Everything you hear in your head when you think bozzio is here. Its bustin' at the seams with his signiture. if you're a Bozzio fan you know what I mean."
4,If Only They Compared,"If most any listener who gave this album 5 stars would have been able to listen to BLS's second album 'Situation Dangerous', they probably would not have given such high marks for this debut, which is barely 4 stars simply for the fact that some of the cuts are brilliant...and some just noodle along to damn much! Trust me...listen to Situation Dangerous, which is DEFINATELY 5 stars...then you'll see what I mean."
1,"Very good musician, poor music !","I like a lot Tony Levin's work with Peter Gabriel, I knew Mr. Stevens for his work with Billy Idol, I must admit that he impressed me a lot on this CD, he's a top guitar player and Joe Satriani should invite him at his next G3 tour, finally, I know Terry Bozzio is a first class drum player...so you have everything to make a great album...this is not the result here. As another reviewer said, musical performance is top rated, but the emotion is missing, no harmony and music goin' nowhere."
2,Eh....fairly Disappointing.,"Disappointing in the sense that I really wanted to believe that these 3 guys could put out some good work. I hate spending good $$ on a CD only to have it be mediocre at best.Sounds rushed, or hurriedly put together as evident from the liner notes of a 4 day recording window. Too bad because such good musicians should have know better than to try and crank something out for the sake of producing an album. Situation Dangerous is better, but still lacking.If you're think of this in the sense of Liquid Tension Experiment forget it. The only commonality is Tony Levin. LTE is light years ahead of this."
1,Worthless,"This looks like a USB data cable, but it isn't. It provides power, but no data. Utterly worthless purchase. Possibly false advertising."
4,A Wake-up call!,"I recently read this fine novel, and as a parent who has chosen to home educate my children, this was a frightening wake-up call! Although fiction, the concept is only an election results night away from becoming reality! Jodi recognizes that our country is at the crossroads, and she is trumpeting her message in a creative, page-turning way! Don't miss this book, and DON'T take the blood-bought freedom of this country for granted!! Bravo, Jodi!!"
5,Does Not Spill,"This cup travels well. I sent my son to 4K all last year using this cup and had no problems. The times that I sent a different cup, his lunch box came back wet. I too wish I new how to get replacement straws. Other than that, my kids and I love this cup."
3,ok cup,We got these cups as a gift and they are great cups except for one thing. The straws don't last long. Both straws got holes in them. They say you can get replacement straws but we have yet to see them in a store. [...]Actually I think the big kid style cups are way better they get my 5 star rating. So if you don't mind paying $5 for the extra straws they are awesome.
3,"Heavy, Where's the desire, where's the light","Here's oneFascinated with Russian Art ageof poetry and painting , propelled shortly before and after the tsar revolution..What an incredibly creative age, non the less, artisically !This bookis for ultra die hards.Poets, ultimately con vey JOYThis book wills not to include that.The miracle of this timeAmidst unimaginable repressionBeauty swayed .This book does not support this ."
1,Not as advertised,I'm very disappointed in this battery. It is not the equivalent of the Nicon EN-EL5and the price was somewhat high for an inferior product. The battery is only 860mAhcompared to the Nicon EN-EL5 that is 1100Mah.
2,Could be better,"It was OK, but it's missing some songs. I was shocked when I didn't see ""Good Work"" and ""Dreams"". Also, there are too many live tracks. I do like, however, how they have some rare photos and a bio, but the track listing is dissapointing. If you're new to the Bodeans, I'd buy Thick as Theives."
1,What a disappointment!,"After reading all those stellar reviews, I couldn't wait until I received this book, hoping to find something new or different. Each resume in the book is virtually the same, the formats are all the same, and all the helpful hints are rehashed from resume books that have been on the market for years, and which are less expensive. I'm sure it is a coincidence that the author is from Georgia, and all those excellent reviews are from Georgia. Save your money! Nothing new here."
1,Not impressive at all for the high cost!,"With the already over-populated resume book market, one wouldwonder why spend the money on this book? It certainly doesn't sayanything new or different.In fact, all of the resumes included for reference have the same ""look and feel."" With the advent of desk top publishing, anyone can effectively produce a professional resume. But if you are looking for some ""basic samples,"" there are many other books on the market to give you more comprehensive information and examples--which cost half as much!"
5,Great Investment!,"My future's so bright I gotta wear shades! Thank goodness I found Execume! I was having a hard time getting interviews and decided to do a little research on resume writing. I followed the simple steps in the book and updated my resume into a powerful representation of myself! Many interviews followed. I was told that my resume stood head and shoulders above the rest and that I was immediatly chosen to come in for an interview out of 700 other resume's submitted. I landed an amazing job shortly thereafter! But the best part of all of this is that Execume helped me increase my salary by $15,000!"
5,Outstanding,"This resume book is a complete solution for the job hunter to be presented in the most favorable light to an employer. It contains the action verbs, tailored resumes by industry, and sample cover letters. I rewrote my resume with it and landed the opportunity I really wanted. This book will motivate the job prospect to succeed. I highly recommend it."
3,smells good.,"it's small, but go to the store and get a free sample. Other then that it smells great!!"
1,DXG = Pure Junk.,"I have owned this camera for about 5 months now and I must say it is real junk. It has broken down on me and cost me over $100 in shipping and handling fees to get it repaired! The pictures a really bad for a 5MP camera. It eats batteries, is difficult to use and performs poorly in low light. The video is blocking and grainy. Put you money into a brand name and stay away from DXG!"
3,What in the world...,"I remember hearing the first Terror 2000 album and having great hopes for a technical death metal masterpiece to follow. The third album, Terror For Sale is pretty much a 80's retrogression while having the worst lyrics possible. Also, Speed's voice is very low now instead of the ""speed"" he had to his voice in the previous albums. One more thing, the production is very different which gives you the feeling that this was really an 80's garage band. Plus they attempt to do high power metal shrieking, which I don't really like.Some good things about this is that the musicianship is pretty good although their sound change is very dissapointing. Also, they manage to pull of some Swedish guitar riffs and solos AND 80's american metal at the same time.I think you should get this album if you are into this kind of stuff. But death metal is for me."
4,Bang yA HEad,"These guys have proven themselves as powerful minds as muscians in their respective bands, this is definately a step forward for this side project, of course their mainstream bands have more success, but this project isnt about payment, at least not in cash form, the paoff here is that they are having fun, each some is pure F**** metal, 'Speed' shows off his many voices on this album his range has got to be the best for sweedish metal, from high pitched screams to guteral punches to raspy snake bites, just listen to track 2 and if youre not impressed then dont bother, this is pure fun for all. all who love metal that is. side note, it really captures 80s thrash as if its still strong."
5,CWTB IS A MASTERPIECE!!!,"[JUNO nominated] CONVERSATION WITH THE BLUES engages you from the get go and draws you into the soulful and thoughtful world of a veteran Blues man who must now be acknowledged as one of Canada's premier songwriters. A magnificent follow-up to 1998's JUNO nominated (Best Blues Album) debut disk Blues Money. This is grownup, confident Blues. Mature stylings, subject matter and exquisitely crafted performances all blend to make each track a shining gem."
4,great story,"Maggie runs away from an abusive father. She and two pets (a pg dog and a 3 legged cat) hide in Beau Jackson's barn. When Beau, a handsome rancher, finds them, he is moved by their condition. He invites Maggie to stay and be his housekeeper until he can find a safe place for her. Maggie is happy to be safe. She meets an interesting bunch of cowboys, who work for Beau. Beau plans to find her a safe place but ends up ""keeping"" her. Gentle, sweet western love story."
2,Graphic SF Reader,"A kid's series it would appear, that you could call Veronica Mars really, really, really, really, really, really lite. As in this is aimed at the single figure and slightly later crowd.It is supposed to be somewhat manga styled, and the 'professor' that is the villain of the piece looks like he is about 23, that sort of a thing. Also, a combination of artwork, and computer graphics, maybe so they can pump them out faster? It is done pretty well, and the background artwork is not so detailed, so maybe that is a labor time thing. Doesn't seem to detract.Basically, the story is a young boy goes missing with a camcorder that has some evidence, and so does an artifact of archaeological significance."
4,Nancy Goes Manga,"This is the first that I've read of the new series of ""manga-esque"" graphic novels featuring the classic ""girl detective"", though it's the second to be published. All in all, it's pretty good, with an interesting and not-at-all simple plot, and above average artwork -- Nancy, George and Bess all look great! (I'm particularly fond of George's -- ahem -- ""boyish"" look, given the early history of the character. Heh heh.) It's definitely several notches above the companion ""Hardy Boys"" manga-esque graphic novel that I've read, which relies way too much on gimmickry and (for a kid's book) excessive violence. This, on the other hand, is a good, old-fashioned, not-terribly violent mystery that still manages to be pretty thrilling in its climactic moments. Its one weakness is a few moments where Nancy is made out to be kind of a ditz. Nonetheless, kudos to Stephan Petrucha and Sho Murase."
1,Waste of Money,I only paid $.99 for this and that should have been an open warning that you get what you pay for. It was trash!!!!!!
4,Good book but missing something...,Alvarez is a great writer and the history of poker detailed in the book is very interesting; I enjoy any story from poker's hay-days. The only problem I had was with the missing text between pages 39-40 where he quotes Jennings Perry about tells. It would be great if someone could post the missing text.
3,History of poker ...,"My husband bought me this book as a gift shortly after I was appointed as a ""global poker specialist"" at an online poker room service provider. Although the stories and histories make for interesting reading, the book was not what I expected. I was expecting a bit more information and advice from the top players of today."
5,Fantastic!!,"I LOVE these skates!! Wish they had these when I was learning!! They are quick and easy to put on. Size adjustment is done with one button. There are 3 different skill level adjustments. The first locks a wheel, which allows a young child to walk in the skates...perfect for my 2 year old! The 2nd allows for forward only motion and the 3rd frees the skates to a ""normal"" mode. The level adjustments are made by sliding one button over, while the skates are on...very simple! The stabilizing training wheels in back are also removable for the more advanced skaters. The only drawback, in my opinion, is that the skates only adjust up to a size 12 shoe. I don't think that they'll fit many kids over age 4. Hopefully, Fisher Price will make a similar skate, perhaps for sizes 12-3."
4,"The true story of ""The Great Escape""","Ever see a movie that was great and then find out it was based on real events? I remember ""The Great Escape"" as one of those movies when I was a kid. So when I found ""The Longest Tunnel"" I had to buy it to see which parts I remembered about the movie really happened. In addition to the engineering effort in building the tunnel, this book is a great background reference on the POW's and their captors. Surprisingly, the events portrayed in the movie were fairly accurate. (Not the Steve McQueen bit with the motorcycle, though). Drawn from interviews of the survivors, camp and official military records, we get to see the follow up story of what happened after hostilities ended. Dedicated to the fifty who were murdered for their daring escape attempt, the story continues with the Allied forces investigative efforts to track down those responsible. The now famous defense of ""just following orders"" did not protect those in the chain of command"
2,"I really wanted to like this CD, but...","Yes, I know it's written and produced by The Clash...well, at least Mick Jones and Joe Strummer. Yes, I know Ellen Foley is a great singer (see: Meatloaf, Night Out, et al.). Yes, I really wanted to like this album, but...except for a couple tepid, overwrought tracks, this is almost unlistenable. Only for Clash purists who want a curiosity keepsake."
3,Life After Meatloaf,"While Meatloaf was trying to recycle flying rodents and demonic idols into yet another symphonic pseudo-rock opus (1981), Ellen said good-bye and teamed up with Jones and Strummer (The Clash) to record ""Spirit of St. Louis."" Close your eyes and imagine The Clash led by a lady with not only an punk attitude, but also an ability to carry a melody. Spirit opens with ""The Shuttered Palace"" where Ellen beckons the listener, ""Won't you come inside my sheltered palace."" Without warning, we're lured into the crashing drums and heavy bass lines of ""Torchlight."" Spirit successfully juxtaposes mid-tempo tunes like ""How Glad I Am"" with no-holds-barred rockers like ""Phase Of Travel."" Minor annoyances include ""My Legionnaire""(better suited for Broadway) and ""Le Palais Secret"" (""The Shuttered Palace"" sung in French). Hot Pick: ""M.P.H"" is guaranteed to get you up from the couch and strutting around the living room like Mick Jagger."
3,Dear Confused,"The album you are thinking about is ""Night Out"" and yes it's a corker.It's very difficult to get on cd.There is a Very Best of that has six of the Night Out tracksWish they would rerelease Night Out with bonus tracks............."
3,Slightly confused,"I'm slightly confused. I thought I remember this album containing a whole different set of tunes? I owned it when it first came out, and you folks are right, shes's a great talent, but the album I'm thinking of had great tunes like ""We Belong to the Night"", ""What's the Matter, Baby"" and a cover of the Stones tune ""Stupid Girl"", with a great accompanying band featuring Mick Ronson, Ian Hunter, and others. Maybe there is yet another Ellen Foley album? (perhaps long out of print). Time does have a habit of scrambling the synapses..."
5,A Dresser Watch,"I have had a Casio G-shock watch for 3 or 4 years which I dearly love, but it doesn't look quite at home on my wrist when I have to wear a coat and tie which is more often than I might wish. So I purchased this watch which is VERY resonably priced and looks more at home on my wrist when I dress less casually plus it still gives me extremely accurate time. I'm very satisfied with this purchase in every regard- accuracy, style, and price!"
3,"OK, but.......","I've had the watch for a couple of months. It's attractive, keeps good time, but: 1st thing was to spend $15 to have the extra-large band shortened. The watch is larger & heavier than one might expect from the photo. Biggest squawk: I've had no luck at all at having it set automatically from the CO. time center, despite numerous trys in various locations in North East states. This is compounded by much difficulty in setting it manually, using complex instructions from the postage-stamp sized instruction book included. If you can tolerate that, it's a decent & smart looking watch for the money."
4,Marvelous collection,"The surviving record of Houdini's dogged effort to become a matinee idol. Includes THE MASTER MYSTERY (1919), an entertaining incoherent serial with the first movie robot, plus TERROR ISLAND (1919), loopy THE MAN FROM BEYOND (1922), HALDANE OF THE SECRET SERVICE (1923) and thrilling fragment of THE GRIM GAME (1919). Houdini radiates charisma, delivers impressive stunts, can't act. Four chapters of the serial and two reels of TERROR ISLAND are missing, but collection quite watchable. Three-disc set includes excellent on-screen notes by Bret Wood, promotional shorts, brief recording of Houdini's voice, and a French short inspired by Houdini's feats. Rewarding."
4,Very Good Set,"The set contains everything in the description with the exception of black Spider-Man. Instead, it contains Venom w/ tongue (and interchangeable head) which was only available in Canada before this. Overall good set. I reccomend it."
5,good book,The guy writes a good book. Extremely accessible and informative.If you've any interest in Language Teaching it's worth a quick read through.Lots of practical information.
2,Didn't come with CD,"This book suppose to come with audio CD it is read along book, and there was no CD attached. So beware, defeats the purpose of this book."
4,A must for people interested in geology,"I love this series, and this one did not disappoint me. In case you are interested in geology and you are going to Hawaii, I can really recommend this one. And who doesn't want to know more about the geology of these islands, especially when you go to the Big Island and visit Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. The only improvement I can recommend is to have clearer maps with clearer indications of points of interest."
3,Not the original design.,I would much rather have the same design as my original food pusher with the two distinct compartments. One closed for pouring liquids and one open for pushing thinner items into the processer such as carrots or celery. Did not see that as an option to order... still looking.
1,Expected a cane made of walnut wood..,Disappointed to find it IS NOT MADE OF WALNUT WOOD. The finish is not walnut. It looks more like a cherry finish.I removed the finish from the last 1/2 inch of the cane finish under the rubber tip and it is a white pine colored wood.Not worth the shipping to send it back.
4,"Incredibly comfortable, but...","These shoes are like walking on air, and they are a great combination of casual and a little tough! Unfortunately, after just a couple of wearings, one of the straw details around the bottom of the shoe has started to come off. It's nothing that can't be easily fixed though, and doesn's effect the whole shoe, so I am still enjoying them!"
4,Great book for encouraging boys to read,This book follows Stink through a couple weeks of his life. Stink is the younger brother of Judy Moody. He is very discouraged because he is the shortest person in his class and it appears that he is shrinking!After I read this book I asked my little one to read it and he enjoyed Stink's comics and the easy flow of the story.
1,Geez,"I have a real problem with how Judy treats Stink in this one. She is a terrible sister - teasing, mean, disrespectful. I realize that that's the point of her character (annoying sister), but for 6-9 year olds, I'm not sure they can read this and realize that no one should treat anyone the way Judy treats Stink. My kids like to read about people being kind to their siblings (Boxcar Children, Cam Jansen, Magic Tree House), and I think that children just learning to read chapter books might not be able to read with the critical eye that's needed when someone as mean as Judy comes on the scene."
4,Great,Great and humorous. The shrinking kid...STINK MOODY! STINK is SHRINKING! One of best books ever read in my life period! :)
5,Funny!,This was a good book and very funny. I can't wait to read more about stink and his crazy things that happen.
3,My 6-year old says...,"The simplest of all reviews. While waiting patiently for the next installment of ""How to Train Your Dragon"" my son and I needed a new read. He's small for his age, so Stink seemed like a good fit. About 20minutes into the read he says, ""It's good, but not at good as Roscoe"" (referring to Roscoe Riles Rules). I had to agree."
5,The Spanish Realist Novel Revisited,"Jo Labanyi, one of the many excellent English scholars who work in Hispanic studies (a notable other being Melveena McKendrick), writes the book that needed to be written reintroducing the Spanish novel of the nineteenth century to academic readers. Her piece on Juan Valera's PEPITA JIMENEZ may be the best article written on that topic. She of course addresses Clarín, Galdós, Pardo Bazán, and the literary milieu.With a tremendously helpful general introduction and a bibliography that just won't quit, this is a must-have for ""decimononistas."""
2,poorly made - too small,The head and the accessories are lame. The head is so small she might as well be using an actual Barbie.
1,Signal degradation,routing a video signal through this switch will degrade its quality to such an extent that you end up with a very dark and lossy signal. The LEDs are incredibly bright but you can't move it out of sight because the weak short range remote needs to be in line of sight. This is a terrible product that is poorly designed.
1,Severely disappointing,"Everything about this device is fine and good, except for one thing: any signal you send through it is noticeably degraded and dark. Kind of ruins the whole point of having higher-quality S-video connections. Avoid."
2,Doesn't Work On Cloth Diapers and Leaves Awful Smell,"This actually kept out wet bag smelling bad and even after being washed and dried, our cloth diapers and prefolds smelled awful, the smell went away after we stopped using this product.Also, it seems ""ok"" on carpet stains but it doesn't work on anything else. Pretty bummed out about this."
3,"Cleaned well, gave rash.","Bought this for cleaning cloth diapers. Cleaned them very well, however, gave my daughter a slight rash. I really wanted to love this product."
3,No help for stains but great for garbage disposal,"I applied this product to stains on clothes and stains on counters with no effect, even soaking overnight. However, it worked to get rid of the stink in the garbage disposal that no amount of hot water or detergent could get rid of. I have also used it as an enzyme cleaner for washing clothes during an insect infestation (maybe bird mites or something microscopic that we were never able to see) when the other enzyme cleaner ran out (Kleen Free), and it seems to have worked. But it does have a strong smell, so I prefer Kleen Free."
5,GREAT for cloth diapering,"I love Bi-O-Kleen Bac out Stain & Odor Eliminator. To me it smells like lime. I get a rash on my hands and arms from most stain spotting agents (shout, spray & wash) and this doesn't bother me. I discovered it when I started cloth diapering. It's great for getting out baby poo stains. Just a squirt in the wash with the nappies and they come out clean and white. I am afraid to use bleach on the diapers and they come out as white as if I had. I squirt a little on a stubborn stain and put it in the sun- ""poof"" it's gone. I have two dogs and discovered it's also good for pet stains. I started leaving a squirt or two in the bottom of the diaper pail and it helps the diaper pail stink. So far it's it's been a gentle cleaner and our very sensitive baby hasn't had any sort of skin problems or diaper rash when using it. I would recommend it for cloth diapering and it's worked great on all the rest of our laundry."
5,Works Really Well! Esp w/pet messes!,Wonderful product that works great! Highly recommended. Concentrated and NON TOXIC! Absolutely love this item. Everyone should try it especially pet owners!
1,Has not gotten the smell out!,"My son had an accident in his car seat, so based on the reviews I thought this would be the perfect thing to clean it. I've applied Bac Out to the seat three times and still it smells. I'm going back to using Nature's Miracle."
1,Bac-Out,"I used the Bac-Out on a pair of jeans that smelled like fish oil. I had tried numerous things to get the odor out, and was told that the Bac-Out would remove the fish oil odor. It did not take out the smell at all,so I was totally disappointed in the product. I would not recommend it."
5,Diaper smell gone...,"I use this in my load of fabric diapers during the soak cycle, and if they are really smelly, then again in the wash, as well. I am very thankful that a friend turned me on to this. I now buy it regularly."
5,Chocolate Silk,"Do yourself a favor put your ears and heart on this one. Robert has a voice like pure honey ~ he writes and produces his music, does voice overs, appears in theater and travels the word quietly entertaining the troops and the masses. He is as nice a gentleman as he is a musical magician ~ trust me on this one. His home is Denver Colorado when he has the luxury to be here ~ one of our own rocky mountain treasures!"
3,Good not great,"Info appears to be ""cherry picked"" to show the Native American in the best of light. What I found interesting was the similiarities between their beliefs and beliefs of many christians. Although the beliefs are not the same there is a lot of simitry."
3,"Opps, included a hoax, but good anyway","Opps, the speach by Chief Seattle was written in 1970 by Ted Perry. Oh well, I would guess the other speaches are real... maybe. Good book anyway."
3,A Response to the White man...,"The book is a list of responses of Native American comments about the white man. Since the true story is not taught in schools, perhaps this may be helpful for a student putting together a book report."
3,What is this past-tense crap?,"The book is couched entirely in how we supposedly 'were'. As if we do not still connect with our Holy Mother the Earth as we always have - & always will do. As if the Traditional Ways are no longer practiced & there are no more authentic Traditional people. What a crock of crap! We still do these things. There are still authentic Traditional people. And there isn't nearly enough material in it, either. Kent Nerburn, this is not your best work. This Sun Dancer with a most public prayer will be charitable & give it a ""c""."
5,Native Wisdom,"I really liked this book, due to the fact I too am a native american indian. I shed tears to know how they were treated. It is a great book to read to learn about your past and present. Thank-you so much. Dianne"
5,Wisdom and sensitivity,"Never mind all those other spiritual books that offer words of wisdom ... if you want to read about nature, religion and mankind from a basic, no frills, good moral values, common sense point of view, told by people who lived life that way, then this is the book for you! I have always admired the ""Native Americans"" for their way of life and for being able to sustain themselves while having to deal with the ""white man's"" treachery and indifference to their well being. I think it is a ""must read"" book, for anyone interested in all aspects of life ...."
3,Enjoy reading,"The book, like others ""for Dummies"" series, is interesting, but just suitable for Small and Home business. In my case, working at a global group, this book is not enough.Anyway, I enjoy reading it!"
1,Spit cup,"Item received was the wrong thing...would have cost more to send it back than it was worth. I was looking for a spit cup and this ""part"" came up. It is NOT a spit cup."
1,Is this a real book....,or the print version of an infomercial? The author repeatedly pushes something called Baby Plus - an expensive pre-natal stimulation device. She claims some study done in Russia showed it to be remarkably beneficial. But the study is not accurately described and the institution that did the study is not specified. I've read several books about pre-natal and early development and they ALL say that no study has ever convincingly shown pre-natal sound stimulation to be beneficial.I think the manufacturer of the Baby Plus product must have paid the author to write this book - but isn't that supposed to be disclosed somewhere?
5,Best spatula,"This is the best ""rubber spatula"" I've ever used. I found myself washing it to use again instead of using the other spatulas in my drawer (including the Pampered Chef one that's supposed to be so great), so I bought a second one. The handle goes way up into the silicone, so there's none of that weird bending you get with flimsier spatulas."
4,"Wrong color spatula, Amazon not accurate","The spatula works fine. My problem is with Amazon itself. I wanted a white one. They advertised a white one on the website (there is a white one on this review!). I ordered a white one. The company shipped me an orange and a red one. The company whom i purchased from and who shipped it to me did right by with a partial refund. I'm pissed at Amazon for misleading me into buying what I didn't want. the colored spatulas are readily available locally, the white ones are not. I WILL NO LONGER TRUST WHAT AMAZON SAYS IT SELLS."
5,Good Product,"I've had this spatula for over a year now... i use it for scrambled eggs on a hot pan, scraping sauces, etc. My spatula hasn't chipped or separated like some of the 1 - ratings i've read for this product. The only bad thing that has happened is that the silicone stained a bit - but only after having it sit in pasta sauce for two days (in the sink). The staining came off after a few washes afterwards. I LOVE THIS SPATULA! I love how it feels in my hand, I love how it's seemless so no food gets stuck in obscure places, I love how nicely it works on a skillet. This Zyliss product gets five stars."
2,Not Very Sturdy,This spatula is not very sturdy. When I use it to mix or scrape a bowl with thick contents the spatula flexes badly.
5,No crannies for mold growth!,"This is a very well-designed spatula. In particular, there's no seam between the head of the spatula and the handle--the silicone is molded continuously from the head to halfway up the handle. (I hate the seam on other spatulas that collects batter, etc, and is almost impossible to clean.)"
1,Doesn't last long,"I really liked this spatula in the beginning, but after just 6 months of very gentle use its head developed cracks and chipped."
2,Lightweight loads only,"I was disappointed with this spatula after having generally good experiences with Zyliss products in the past. After a few modestly heavy loads, the hard plastic of the upper handle and the soft soft silicone of the lower blade started to separate and seem like they'll be coming apart soon. I had hoped it would be more durable."
2,Woops! Only 8 photos on this book.,"After reading the reviews, i was eager to receive this, especially as I'm only beginning my journey into the mind of Joseph Cornell. I was disappointed. The book is tiny - there are photos of only eight of Cornell's works and the prose, although nice, really isn't all that enlightening or inspiring, giving me nary a ""hmm"" factor.It's a lovely little book for what it is, which isn't much. If like me, you're just discovering Cornell, this is not the place to start. I wish I knew the best place to point you, but I'm looking for that myself."
1,For The Record... This is not what you're looking for.,"This is NOT a R0/R1 release of the R2 dvd by the same name, Take That For The Record THE OFFICIAL DOCUMENTARY, as widely advertised.This is a ""100% unauthorized"" (taken directly from the back insert) RIP-OFF titled Take That For The Record A CRITICAL FILM REVIEW.This is another one of those occasions when one should be permitted to rate an item ZERO.BOOOOO!"
1,Now it's USELESS !,"About a couple weeks after i purchased this ring for my husband, the cross design on the inside fell out. He tried to put it back in but now it is soo loose that it just falls right back out. He has tried to wear it without the cross but he can't. When the cross is not inside the ring, the are where the cross is supposed to be is soo soft that it squeezes together and misshapes the ring. Please don't get me wrong, this is a beautiful ring but his was apparently defective. Everytime he takes the ring off the cross flies to the ground. The cross itself is very sharp around the edges. Hope others have better luck !"
3,Looks cool but too much maintenance for a ring,"This ring looks very cool! The only drawback is that the cross design is actually a separate piece of the ring and it pops out whenever the ring is removed. This also tends to make the ring a little less than comfortable at times. When the cross design insert is removed the ring becomes weaker as it bends easier. In general I guess it's a pretty nice looking ring, but I don't wear it that much because of the little annoyances. Hard to complain though when the price is so nice. Definitely worth the price! :)"
5,Awesome Ring,Great ring. Fits great. Wonderful quality. Would suggest this to anyone. Supplier shipped it fast (3-4 days it was at my mail box!)...in the middle of December.
4,Not crazy about the cutout cross...,"I didn't realize when I bought this that the cross was a separate piece. Unlike the other reviewers, I haven't jacked with mine, so it looks the same as it did the day I bought it (nearly a month later), but I dont' like the idea that it can bend or distort contrary to the rest of the ring.I would be happier with the cross simply carved into the ring."
2,Stamped cross ring,This ring arrived with poor stamping of the crosses. They were stamped with part of the cross hanging down inside. Took it too a jeweler and they hammered it back into the ring. My wife loves the ring and wears it all the time now.
3,Great after I fixed it...,"I wanted a small and simple USB hub, this device is exactly that. The design is perfect for anyone with a notebook and a road warrior simplicity requirement. Anything good about this product ends there, when I received this product it didn't work.I initially decided to just return it, but I just didn't want to go through all the hopes and than wait a couple weeks for a replacement. I have a pretty decent hardware background so I just decided to take it apart instead. The problem was rather simple and only required soldering a wire back onto the board. Again this is not a bad product after I fixed it, there just didn't seem to be any Q.C. which would have prevented the experience I had with this company."
1,Mine didn't work either,"This is the exact product I was looking for. Hooking it to the back of my iMac would let me access the port easily and have extra connections.Unfortunately, only one of the connectors works. So it is basically no better than simple 6"" extension cable.I noticed the other reviewer had a bad cable too and was able to repair it. I may give it a shot, but will probably just toss it in the trash. It would cost more to ship it back than I paid for it."
1,Save your money,"At first glance it would appear this book would be a bible for all power boaters. This is not the case. The writer seems content passing his ""war stories"" off as fact and the only explanation as to why/how certain things happen on a boat. This is the 2nd. Edition and it reads and looks like it was written 20 years ago. Some care could have been taken to make a 1999 publication look like a 1999 publication. Early on in the ""Becoming an informed buyer"" section there is not one mention of using the internet as an information source. I think Newsgroups (like rec.boats) and other sites should be given at least a mention.In the equipment section he mentions a 200,000 or 300,000 candle power portable searchlight are sufficient for nighttime cruising. PLEASE! Anyone who has seen/used one knows they are complete junk. In 1999 they sell great 1 million candlepower portables for next to nothing.Finally the author calls Dock Line, ""Rope"". Do I need to say more?"
2,power cruising:,"This useful basic introduction to the subject was spoiled for me by the lack of intelligent editing. Most importantly, the text becomes highly irritating with the frequent re-iteration of cute phrases such as ""first-rate first mate"" (for his wife); ""very able research assistant"" (for two or people who had so served) and ""swinging on the hook"" (for at anchor). Beyond that, the author's detailed memory for meals eaten aboard serves only to annoy. The addition of this and other, similiarly fluffy material makes one wonder if the intention is to meet a assigned page target. The fault may well lie with the editor, who should have chopped out the redundencies and enough fluff to permit more practical details, particularly regarding ""down in the bilge"", which tends to get short shrift. In sum, a book for beginners with money to spend which needs editing."
5,"Well done, really well done","If you want to learn about pioneers, read this book. It is exceptionally well researched and written. The detail is amazing, even with information gleaned from wills. How interesting. I've read many books about people like those featured in this book, but this is one of the best in terms of really giving full, complete figures to these people so you feel as if you really do know and understand them. The book also gives you a sense of how brave these people were to leave perfectly good and safe homes in the east to build entirely new lives in a total wilderness."
2,Not terribly great acting here,"A cast of unknowns make this potentially interesting. However, they almost all overact, especially the rich jealous husband whose antics are actually comedic rather than threatening. The Scottish investigator also oversteps at times, and the beautiful wife is mostly clicheed. The plot twists are ok, but not all that surprising. This has the whiff of a TV movie at times."
5,Purchased as a gift,"And he loved it. He was very happy with them and was showing them off to a friend. Apparently I won ""cool points"" with this purchase. :0)"
3,A little dull,"There is interesting and valuable information in this book, but the presentation -- the writing -- is about as dull as you can find. I would recommend it as supplemental material, but not your first read prior to law school. I can recommend ""Acing You First Year Of Law School"" by S.C. Noyes & H.S. Noyes. It touches on the same material, but the writing is leaner and far more approachable."
4,Informative overview of the legal system and the law,"This book was recommended in a class I took which had both law students and non-law graduate students like public health students. I found it a very readable introduction to both the legal system and the basics of law. Topics include the concept of jurisdiction, different levels of appeal, rulings vs. dicta, different types of law (legislative, administrative, common law, etc.) While the book is targeted at people about to start law school, it may be surprisingly interesting for the general reader as well. Even sections on how to summarize cases and write essays on law, might carry over to other kinds of professional writing as well."
3,A thoughtful road map that hits and misses.,"Law School Without Fear has its heart in the right place and fine sections regarding briefs, exam strategies, and psychological traps a typical first year law student will face. However, they bog down a great portion of the book with policy issues that give a forum for the authors personal beliefs. A clunky writing style doesn't win the book any stars, but the practical pointers make the book worth reading."
2,Waste of time...,"No offense to the authors. I'm sure their intentions were good.This book is dry as sand in your mouth and not specific enough to make any sort of difference to anyone.My law school told me this was 'mandatory' and made sure that we purchased copies before orientation, specifically to learn about case briefing. Unfortunately, this book talks about case briefing in theory, but doesn't bother with teaching the student to brief or show examples of what a case brief looks like.For a vague, general view of law school, this book does a decent enough job, assuming you have the patience, but if you want a book with tips and techniques, this isn't it. Law School Confidential is a much easier read and provides far more information in a far more organized and efficient way."
3,Better than I thought it would be,"Given the title of this book, I was expecting a bunch of fluff and drivel. But it's a somewhat useful book to lightly read before starting your first year. That way you won't need to worry about learning legal/procedural basics while you're figuring out tort law. Most people in my class read about half of the book. But parts of it are insultingly basic and you'll probably skip a few chapters unless you completely slept through civics class."
2,Not really that helpful,I read this rather expensive book at the beginning of law school but didn't get much out of it. The only helpful thing in here is the stuff on case breifing...but we learned that from trial and error anyway.
5,Wonderful!!!,Very informative. Exactly what I was looking for and for a very reasonable price. Quite helpful!
3,sturdy and a bargain,"I purchased 2 of these faucets because of the high quality and extremely good price. They arrived on time and in perfect condition.The faucets are chrome and very shiny..too shiny for their large size.Brushed nickel would have been more attractive, but the price would have been substantially higher.I will buy the Danze brand again...an excellent product."
4,Could have been the perfect Line Up...,"Good album but could have been better considering the musicians involved in the project(Lord-Moody-Powell).Graham Bonnet is definitly a great singer who can deliver solid Hard rock performances as well as cool/crooner type of vocals.It is a high quality album in term of production (even if very 80's) and performance-both vocal and musical, but sometimes feels like an embryonic version of Rainbow's ""Down to Earth"" or Whitesnake's ""Slide it In"".A must have for every Bonnet fan, Jon Lord and Micky Moody fans will find the solos a bit short..."
3,DBZ Movie Trilogy,"First I want to say these aren't the best of the DBZ movies I have all 13 DBZ movies and there are way better ones than these if you are looking for Super Saiyans in these movies you won't get them they don't start showing Super Saiyans until movie 5. These movies are World Strongest, Dead Zone, and Tree of Might they are good if you are starting to collect the Movies this is a good start then move on with the other ones.... But if you do get these you will definately have to get the Lord Slug movie also that will then keep you updated on the movies... But like i said these aren't the best of the movies and if you are just looking for Super Saiyans these aren't tapes for you... I recomend Android through World Tournoment tapes if you want Super Saiyans...."
5,I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE IS THE BEST TOONAMI VIDEO AND ANIMATED,IF YOU CAN TRY TO WATCH THE SERIES AND YOU WILL LOVE THAT MORE THEN ANY OTHER SERIES. IT IS ONE OF THE COOLEST ANIMATED SERIES AROUND.
2,"Overpriced, replaced by Chan's book, hard to look up info","I'm mad at our Java teacher for making us buy these recently instead of the far better and cheaper book Java Class Libaries: An Annotated Reference.These volumes have the worst info-lookup scheme imaginable. They are organized by package, not by class, yet the package is not shown in the heading -- only the class name is shown, and it's in the gutter rather than the outer edge. The only way to find anything in these books is to look it up in the index. These books will not be updated for Java 1.1; the series will build on Chan's book instead, fortunately."
5,Thorough coverage of the essential features of Java.,Describes in detail how to program in Java. Intended for readerswith previous programming experience. Requires careful attentionand some work on the part of the reader to supply the details .
2,Use to read aloud to your friends with kids,"Too short! This small book is a collection of Barry wit... one witticism per page. I can't picture it being worth the full price, even if you are a Dave Barry fan. However, I picked up mine for a buck even at B&N. At about a penny per comment, I felt there was balance in the universe."
2,"Barry's great, but THIS title is not...","Let me begin by saying that I love the humor of Dave Barry. However, for this title (I ordered the Kindle version) you don't get a ""book"" in the usual Dave Barry style. It's more a ""Chicken Soup"" type book. Each page is a paragraph or so that stands alone, each unrelated to the next apart from the common parenting theme. These seem to be a ""best of"" group, selected from previous books or newspaper columns. If I'd known this in advance, I probably wouldn't have purchased this one. Don't misunderstand -- they're nice, funny, sometimes even hilarious. However, they're just brief quotes, not fully developed stories. Again, no fault of the humorist, but it wasn't a very satisfying read."
3,"Cute, amusing, not worth paying list price for.","But since it is almost certainly possible to find it for less than list price, what the heck. It's worth a quick read if you can get it cheap; there are some very funny bits in here. Just not enough of them to make a full-priced book."
3,Cute gift for a parent,"A cute, funny collection of clips from Dave Barry's columns over the years. Anything funny he wrote about parenting. You can read it in an hour or less and it would make a good gift book for a parent."
1,Dave Barry is getting lazy,"Unlike his first dozen or so books, this offering is so meager as to be insulting to his fans. I loved the guy from the first newspaper column I stumbled across. Now I think he should quit being so lazy, or quit writing."
1,The Ultimate Guide To Pipe Collecting?,"RARE SMOKE The Ultimate Guide To Pipe Collecting sounds like a reference book for pipe collecting. I have reference books on other subjects for collectors. Compared to these other books, I have the following comments on RARE SMOKE. First, this is a reference book that DOES NOT HAVE AN INDEX. The photographs are of low quality. There are photos that are so blurred that one cannot see the detail that they were included to illustrate. The content is very limited. Many manufacturers and models are not included. And dating and pricing most of the limited number of pipes that are included is not possible."
2,God-obsessed or Self-obsessed?,"After reading three-fourths of the book (I couldn't get through any more) I found myself feeling as if Storms is more interested in himself than anything else. He forces himself on the reader. I began to feel hammered over the head with his very SUBJECTIVE perceptions of life and beauty. After a while he comes off sounding oddly defensive, self-centered, and even pedantic. I love the concept (that's why I picked up the book in the first place) and the Storms includes many wonderful quotations, especially those from C.S. Lewis, but I found the writing nauseating."
4,Good but too small.,"This product is Ok for small spaces, it was my fault to order it.Thanks Amazon and Target anyway."
2,"Fantastic music, horrible sound","I had the vinyl of this wonderful album. Great, great rock and soaring harmonies. Then this CD comes along. Harsh to the point of sibilence, the thin sound robs all the warmth and dimension from the sound. Rob Fisher's mastering is an abomination. This is classic rock and pop that deserves good - no, great - sound. This is truly one of the worst-sounding CD's I have ever heard. Pity, because it is also one of the best albums of all time. 5 stars for the music. -5 for the mastering."
1,Not Happy!,"Sorry to say but I didn't get a chance to listen to this CD. When I finally got this in the mail after going around the country for weeks I got the darn thing and it was the case that is cracked all to crap. Was sent back to supplier for full refund. No sale on damaged goods. Planning on reordering from another source. Other than that I do have Hot Wacks which is pretty good for the time it was produced, to bad these Canadians didn't have the right producers to get their asses in gear with a group that had some talents. Rock On Canada!"
1,Beauty is only skin deep,"First of all, let me say that this is a very attractive canister set. The stylish horizontal viewing window is unique among storage canisters. Unfortunately, it's also the reason this product is defective. The plastic window is not securely bonded to the stainless steel bottom of the canister. I too suffered the same fate as other reviewers who said that the bottoms fell out of their canisters with the first use. Fortunately, mine dumped only coffee beans all over the countertop, which were relatively easy to clean up.There is no handle or lip on the lids of the canisters to facilitate their removal. Removing them is a two-handed operation, and the largest containers are difficult to grasp with one hand while removing the lid with the other.I cannot recommend this product...at any price."
2,Fairies in Victorian Art,"I thought this book had a very complete selection of Victorian fairy paintings, however, the reproduction quality of the paintings was not good. By comparison, the reproduction quality in Jeremy Maas' Victorian Fairy Painting was far superior, but there were less paintings. Having been involved in the publishing and printing of fine art books for years, I was unable to keep this book knowing that the compromised reproduction quality did not justify the ""fine art"" book price. If you have a critical eye and would prefer to go for quality of reproduction, rather than quanity of paintings, I would recommend the Maas book."
4,The war continutes,This book was written very well and if you like Sci-fi Fanatasy books than this one is a must read. Journey with the man of three waters as he must unite the Faerines and the humans in a battle with the minions of Darkblood.
4,Useful in moderation,"In terms of standard 17th thru 19th century repertoire, this is a comprehensive repertoire listing, which is particularly useful for teachers of advanced piano students to help choose pieces for students. A ""difficulty"" rating is assigned to every piece of piano music, which I would take with a grain of salt - this is certainly subjective. There are lots of nice unexpected surprises listed - works that I didn't know existed, and information on their publishers. In terms of modern repertoire, there are some helpful suggestions, but I think that the field is simply too big (as well as constantly changing as new composers come along), so pianists should investigate their contemporary music choices through other channels."
5,Unlimited uses!,I never run out of uses for this - wonderful for temp hold while marking drill points or by itself. I have had things safely hanging on my walls for years with just this wax. Great stuff!
1,All-New Waste of Money,"This DVD is the bigest ripoff I have ever been duped into wasting my money on! The whole video keeps you on the edge of your seat ... hoping that it's going to get better ... but it never does! They've got a lot of nerve calling it a DVD! There isn't one single option available to the viewer.. such as viewing angle or Language. There is about 3 minutes of ""workout"", if you can call it that, on the whole DVD and there is nothing steamy about it except you after you realize you've been ripped off! I only chose to rate it 1 star because no stars was not an option!"
1,Dissapointed,This is one the WORST Penthouse videos I've ever seen. Don't waste your money you can see more in a Disney Movie!!! A total waste of beautiful woman. Bob Guccioni would roll over in his grave!!
1,Worst Penthouse Vidoe I've seen in years...,"I've seen a lot of Penthouse videos and this one is definately not worth the money. Not only is the video quality & direction very poor but the women didn't really seem to be into it at all. This video could easily obtain an ""R"" rating if it wanted to, something that you couldn't say about any of the other Penthouse videos I've seen..."
3,$71.39 strong citus smell,"This arrived with one bottle in the corner cracked and leaking powder. I am replacing my dwindling supply of Seventh Generation because 7thGen is packaged in cardboard and most of them were leaky. 7thGen had no smell which is fine because Cascade smells dangerous. BiOKleen's smell is hard to ignore.P.S. after a few months, I have found this to be much better than 7th Gen. Dishes come out cleaner with this product than with 7th Gen."
3,Does the Job,"The price is right, and it gets the job done. I never noticed the excessive citric odor mentioned in some reviews. Want cleaner dishes? Pre-rinse your dishes before putting them in the dishwasher, set the dishwasher to use HOT water, don't let food dry on the dishes, and prevent hardwater blockages of the dishwasher's water jets by running vinegar, Glisten or citric acid crystals through the dishwasher once a month. (See my review for Glisten)."
5,Great product!,"This dish powder smells really good, works better than any other dishwasher powder I've ever tried, and it's even environmentally friendly!"
1,Not too exciting,"I was disappointed with these stencils. There was not much variety and the stencils just aren't very cute! They are all quite small, as well."
4,makes changing the water and refilling easy and simple,"well made ,easy to use, price is high for what you get. I added a filter for refilling and it adapted easily"
4,Comments from a native speaker,"Although interesting, I find Panu's review way out of line. Saying that the language in this book is that of Helsinki Skinheads is absurd altogether. The Finnish in this book is simply the Finnish used in Helsinki (and most major cities), I can't see how on earth this has anything to do with skinheads.. This is the language used by youngsters in Disco's, clubs, on the streests, in the schools and universities etc. One could only hope that the visitor to this site will take Panu's comments for what they're worth.For the book itself, it is quite good even if the way of describing Finnish grammar is highly un-orthodox. The vocabulary is quite comprehensive and most dialouges are well wuited for the learner.When completing this course, the reader will be able to converse with nativr Finnish speakers and take part in normal life."
2,Bites off more than it can chew,"This book falls between several stools. It tries to teach absolutely everything about both written and spoken Finnish in too small a space. It also uses a non-standard approach to Finnish grammar which is confusing and unclear even to some native speakers I have asked ! For learners who are already at a reasonable standard, the dialogues are good examples of authentic spoken language, but I do not recommend this book for beginners at all."
2,Beginners: keep away.,"Very frustrating to use. The book doesn't allow the reader to become comfortable with Finnish slowly and build a decent bedrock of vocabulary and grammar. Instead, even in the very beginning it mentions all sort of pedantic asides and exceptions to the rules, making the whole thing appear very daunting right from the start. Its layout is unclear and it doesn't have enough examples. You'll probably find yourself having to read the same sentence several times to absorb the rule the author is trying to lay down: a book on a difficult language that's written in poor English is the kiss of death for the beginner."
4,"So far, so good!","I own a couple other books on Finnish and so far this one seems to be the most practical. It's great to learn the proper way to speak, as well as the colloquialisms of the language -- this is the only book of mine which covers this aspect. Had I had this book when I lived in Finland for a year, I'd probably have picked up a lot more of what around me was being said!"
1,I want my money back,Why oh why did I buy this book. I just wanted to speak some finnish and I thought two tapes was good value. I should have bought teach-yourself instead. The tapes are more english than finnish and there is virtually no match between the tapes and and the book. The book might by fine for a University course or for someone who already knows the language but otherwise it's useless to someone about to travel to the country. I've learnt more finnish from the official goverment website which has one page on useful phrases. Good money down the drain and maybe I'll know better next time.
3,The Complete Language Course,"I want these books - textbooks, because my fried came from Finland. And here - in the Czech Republic are not books for learning finnish language."
2,A lot of fluff,"So many words, explaining so very little. Very frustrating as you have to do some leg work to follow the examples, it's not a step by step book so it assumes current knowledge levels, which oddly enough, if you had, you wouldn't need this book. The examples don't lend themselves to real world scenarios so q bit ridiculous viewing book with that perspective."
1,ARE YOU KIDDING ME??,"I'm sorry, but WHAT on God's Green Earth are these people talking about when they say ""the highest quality wholesome ingredients???"" The first ingredient listed is corn syrup, followed closely by sugar. God. I'm livid. Corn is a subsidized crop in this country and corn syrup is a MAJOR culprit in the obesity epidemic. Spare yourself. Eat a damn piece of fruit.Many Thanks,The Food Zealot"
2,"Terrible Assembly Directions, Good Product","This shovel is great for clearing off large areas of snow. We use it where I work to clear off the driveways into and exiting the parking garage under the building. However, the assembly instructions were TERRIBLE!!! Additionally, many of the pre-drilled holes were the wrong size for the bolts and screws that were sent with the shovel.Definitely not worth the irritation to put it together."
3,A listenable collection of songs.,"Bonfire is a pretty good German band that plays music in a melodic hard rock direction. This hits package contains material from various albums. All of the tunes are recordings from 1986-1997. Bonfire sounds similar to bands like Bon Jovi and Firehouse. The disc doesn't just include ballads like part of the album's title states--straight-ahead rockers are also included. There's a total of seventeen tracks. Bonfire's musicianship is tight, and their songwriting skills are satisfying. The vocalist does an efficient job, too. I find all of the tracks to be listenable and good. Some of the ones that I like are ""Give It a Try"" and ""Take My Heart and Run."" Bonfire also performs a version of Billy Squier's song ""The Stroke."" I think that it's a cool version. Bonfire is pretty formulaic, but I still think that they are a listenable band. This disc contains a nice collection of songs that I like to listen to from time to time. Worth a listen."
3,A Pretty Good Collection Of Melodic Hardrock Songs,"Bonfire is not a bad band. Not very original, but they still wrote some pretty good songs that are included on this hits collection. They remind me of bands like Bon Jovi and Fire House. Melodic Hardrock flavor. The songs aren't very memorable, but they still are good for the type of music that they represent. Standout songs are ""Give it a Try"" and ""Take My Heart and Run."" They also do a cover of the Billy Squire song ""The Stroke."" This group is German, but you can't tell--they sound like an American band. That's not important though. Bonfire isn't very original, but they are good musicians that write decent songs. Not bad."
3,Served Their Purpose,"I purchased these pantyhose for a Halloween costume. Considering the inexpensive price, and the fact that I would only be wearing them once, I wasn't expecting anything fantastic. That being said, they did tear a little as soon as I put them on. The size was correct, and I did not force them on, so obviously the material isn't the greatest. They served their purpose for the night, but I would not buy them for more than one use."
4,Aquired Taste,"I know every word that Anthony Rapp sings on the RENT soundtrack, and have thought that he was a wonderful singer/actor since I was ten. That said, I didn't enjoy this cd as much as I thought I might. Some of the lyrics don't fit too well, and the music isn't the type that I usually like. However, after listening to each song a few times, I found myself liking them more and more. 'Just Some Guy' is as good as everyone seems to think it is, although I thought that 'Living Alive' seemed a bit cliched (""You can't be anyone else/You've got to be yourself...""). I liked the cd overall, but I don't think that RENT fans should assume that they will love it simply because the singer/songwriter is a member of the original cast."
3,Anthony Rapp,This CD is good but I thought his music would be more like the songs in RENT ... I dont know why. I wasnt horribly impressed but still glad I got it since I love Anthony Rapp
5,So good!,"I bought this album after falling in love with Rent soundtrack, and then Rent itself. After hearing a clip of ""Just Some Guy"", I knew I needed the album. It's so good! My favorite song on the album is ""Room to Breathe"" which is so sweet and wonderful. It has a great acoustic guitar behind it, and the words are so touching. My other favorites are ""Out Out Damn Spot"" which is hysterical and sounds like it fits in some musical (the video included on the CD for it is also great!), ""Just Some Guy"", which is incredibly sweet and sung with this complete trueness and ""Goodbye"" which rocks the album. The variety of this CD is great, and it's a must have for any Rent, Broadway or Anthony fan!"
5,Awesome!,"I am a huge fan of Anthony Rapp, and last October my friends and I went to see him live in concert. His new CD 'Look Around' had just been released, and I bought it that night. He is an amazing performer - the songs were awesome live! I'm glad that I have the CD to remember that concert. This album truly captures Anthony's talent and emotions. My favorite is ""Out Out Damn Spot"" (the video rocks!) but I also love ""Living Alive"" and ""Then Again"" and all the others. This CD is a must-have for all RENT heads... but while you're buying music, make sure that you pick up Adam Pascal's 'Model Prisoner.' :-) These are my 2 favorite CDs of the year."
4,Not necessary if you bought Bridal Bargains!,"The book was very helpful with well researched information. However, if you bought Bridal Bargains by the Fields you would probably have all the information you'd need about dresses in that book. In addition to the great (albeit abbreviated compared to this entire book) section on dresses, their makers, fabric quality and sizing information, you receive TONS of valuable information for the rest of your wedding. If your dress is the most important part of your wedding, then this book might be a good addition to Bridal Bargains."
3,"Some helpful info, badly written.","There is some helpful buying advice in this book, mixed in with a lot of misinformation and an annoying excess of supposedly humorous remarks. If the authors had stuck to their subject instead of constantly cracking stupid jokes, the book would be half the size it is.Their descriptions of fabrics uses incorrect terminology and pronunciations, and their verbal descriptions of gowns is virtually useless-- whoever bought a gown just by reading about it? The authors also seem to have very provincial tastes, preferring Bonney gowns (polyester explosions) to Carolina Herrera (international couture).The only valuable parts of the book are the parts about contracts, sizing, ordering, dealing with a bridal salon, and other business matters.Get a copy at the local used book store, or borrow the library's copy--now there's a money-saving tip for you!"
1,"They didn't do their research, Pearl's Place was terrible!","They referenced Pearl's Place as an A place on the web, and frankly they were completely wrong. This place is really nice to you when you want to buy a dress, but after that point in time, I have never run into another company that could care less about their customers. They put you on hold for twenty minutes. They sent me a dress in a different color than I asked and then tried to blame it on me. The people there are very short with you. They won't give you more than 1 minute if you call them. They have absolutely no concern for you. If Pearl's Place is any indication of the other A rated sites, I would highly recommend you not taking the suggestion of this book because Pearl's Place was the worst experience I have ever had in any purchase of anything in my entire life."
1,"Lies, Deception, and uneducated","This book is full of lies. It talks as if all bridal stores are trying to decieve the customer. Not all bridal stores sell gowns as new from their stock. Not all stores lie and keep the customers in the dark. Do these people actually work in a bridal store? NO they simply got married. Where do they get their information? Do they take it from other stores? Do they also realize that sizing sheets change in midseason sometimes? How well can they be trusted?Bottom line that they want you to come away with....Don't have the wonderful experience of going to a Full Service Bridal Salon and get pampered and waited on professionally, but go to a discount warehouse where you order out of a catalog and never really get to see the dress. Or better yet, use other stores, lie yourself, and go to a warehouse. Question, are they in fact asponsored by a discount chain?I do NOT recommend this book."
5,They were right...Pearl's is GREAT!,This book is a must read for anyone getting married who's seriously concerned about getting a quality gown. I read their book and (thankfully) found Pearl's Place. I saved almost $1000 combined on my gown and headpiece. I will never buy formalwear anywhere else. Fred (Pearl's owner) is the nicest man in the business and a true class act! Thanks Fields' for writing such a great reference for us brides-to-be!
5,Delightful AND Profound,"This little book says it all. If you ever think life is too complicated and frenzied and stressful, read this story about Selma. She knows the secret of happiness in this life and you'll want to share her wisdom with everyone you care about."
5,A jewel for the spirit,"I found this book in you tube and I love it. In the first oportunity that I had I bought it. It is a real jewel... The simplicity of the story and the drawings as well as the given message make this book a must to have and a great gift for any ocassion. This book is now in the first places of my ""10 top books to love and to have"""
4,Cowboy Parables,"Leo has written a wonderfully funny book, to help express new bible-based ideas, in the form of humorous life-experience parables."
1,very poor,"after recieving this game, found out that it didn't work..took it and had it professionally cleaned....still doesn't work...takes forever to load, then there is no background graphics..was a complete waste of money...bought the companion book to go with it....now its worthless too. thanks alot"
4,good steady soul album,"Very good voices, nice and smooth tracks, a fine production. This really is a good soul-album :)"
2,Come apart in the dryer,"Dryer balls are great and usually work very well. Unfortunately, this brand is more of a hassle than anything. Both balls came apart at the seam the very first time I used them. I have another set that do not do this and work wonderfully, I just don't remember the brand."
5,The Best,I've been interested in healthy baking since I was in college and introduced to Whole Wheat Flower. This is flat out the best and really the only book you'll ever need to bake with whole grains.
5,"""Special"" squirrel teaches kids to appreciate uniqueness","If you have or know a child that is having trouble fitting in, this is a great book to share with him or her. The main character, Norman, is taken on a journey that shows him how to embrace his uniqueness and fend off his insecurities escalated by the ""normal"" squirrels around him. Other animals in the Allegory Forest have their own stereo-type busting traits and bolster Norman's confidence.This book is a nice length to give a younger reader a little bit of mental exercise and will be able to hold the interest of an adult if he or she is reading it to a child."
1,Very uncomfortable!,"Loved how cute these shoes were, but hated how uncomfortable they were. The leather is very hard and I couldn't bare to try to break them in. I ended up selling them to a local Buffalo Exchange for less than I paid."
2,wrong age info for this product!,"The age info for these skates and the similar ones for boys is completely wrong. They fit up to a size 11 shoe (NOT size 12), which most children outgrow by the age of 4 or 5 (my daughter has small feet and could still wear the skates at age 6). The locking mechanism isn't perfect, so when you start your beginner child on them she might all of a sudden find herself rolling too fast. My daughter (a tentative type) did not learn to skate with this product before she outgrew it."
5,Excellent 1st skates!,"Got Barbie for daughter (4), My 1st for son (3), both love them! Still on setting 1 (2nd roller locked) but they haven't fallen! Don't know how long they'll last but I'm very glad I chose these. They allow the kids to slowly get used to skating without the pain. Have to switch to setting 2 soon (they're bored), but at least they'll be used to them when they fall!"
5,Perfect gift!,My daughter loves these skates. She was skating like her big brother in a matter of one afternoon. Great Christmas gift and very affordable. Made our hearts happy that she is enjoying them so much.
5,The life of General Daniel Morgan,"This is a reprint of the original book of the mid 1850's. Much closer to the life of General Morgan than current biographers. It is well documented with references to original Revolutionary War period papers, reports and letters of people who knew and served with General Morgan. He is a person that history books glosses over, but is as important as Washington to the successful outcome of the Revolutionary War. His first campaign started with Braddock and finished with the surrender of the British Army. A remarkable man who runied his health to serve his country."
4,Screwball delight,"I beg to differ with Scotsladdy. This is silliness carried to a delicious extreme. Stanwyck as a sleuthing debutante gets to be fearless, witty and gorgeous at the same time as she carries on a Taming of the Shrew-type class-war romance with youthful class warrior Fonda. There are no profound depths here, but many laughs(including quite a few by Hattie McDaniels), and the feminist slant of the plot--maligned Junior Leaguers aim to show up scoffing police--is great fun."
5,A Must See,I love the interaction between Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda. My wife loves the dresses the girls wear throughout the show.
3,MEDIOCRE SCREWBALL.,"Definitely a mixed bag. This is a good example of something which was ground out by film studio people in a desperate mood. Miscast, Barbara Stanwyck plays a dizzy debutante who's one of a covey of Junior League girls in fox capes; she walks her dog at three in the morning after a costume ball, and encounters a corpse in a deserted house. Inspired by the spectacle, she immediately corrals her flighty friends - in their best party dresses - and they scurry around the scene of the crime, looking for clues and squealing much of the time...A great example of the kind of idiotic films which helped kill the screwball genre. Hank Fonda is the hero; he and Hattie McDaniel are likewise wasted in this unfortunate attempt at humour."
1,Nothing comes out!,My 2 year old daughter can suck out one small sip and then I have to open the lid to relieve the pressure so she can take one more drink. This is crazy! The pair I got does not leak....and doesn't allow my daughter to drink either. I've contacted Munchkin and am awaiting their response as to how to return them. There must be some discrepancy in these cups....they either leak or nothing comes out! I wouldn't recommend these to anyone!
1,Terrible!,"First of all, my husband and I bought these because they are bigger than her Avent cups and my daughter loves Dora. We get them home and as I am washing them to give her when she wakes up in the morning, I realize that one of them leaks! I tried taking the top on and off, I shook it, water still came out. I tried messing with the spill-proof valve, and that had nothing to do with it. The water was pouring out from underneath the screwed on top. But it was only one of them.So the next day, I give her the one that wasn't leaking and there's still a problem...she has to suck way too hard to get anything out! I even tried it and it was hard for me, and I'm 27! I told her she'd just have to try harder, and let her walk around the house with it, until she started whining. I looked at her and her lips were slightly swollen from all of the sucking! They hurt and were puffy! I'm calling the company first thing Monday morning, as this is Saturday night, and complain and demand my money back!"
5,Love them!,"After going through many sippy cups, not because my daughter didn't like them, but because they leaked, ""broke"" (valves coming out), or my daughter chewed a hole in the nipple, I found these ones. They're fantastic! They hold a lot of water so we only have to bring one with us on trips, and after she got over the initial dislike of the valve (it was a little hard for her to get the water out at first) she started to like it, and now loves her ""Dodo"" (Dora) cups."
4,Country with a new spin,"This album took me by surprise. I did not expect to enjoy a country album as much as I enjoyed this one. If you are looking for a country record with an interesting sound to it, check this one out. It has an alternative rock sound to it, which blends nicely with its country, blue-grass roots. Most of the sixteen tracks are quite good, especially 'King of the Minimum Wage'. All in all, a rockin album."
5,Revelations of St. Bridget,"The book is absolutely amazing. If anyone is trying to increase their knowledge on this subject, this book is a must. As a novice to this subject, (and without trying to give the enjoyment of reading the book away)I did not know that St. Bridgets writings were actually in three persons (that of Jesus, the Blessed Virgin Mary and herself). The writings are spiritually uplifting and I highly recommend you reading this.Amen."
5,Innocense and Purity; Love and Compassion,I never knew the Blessed Mother until I read this book. I was allowed to know Jesus as the son of Mary from His birth to His Crucifixion.Revelations of St. Bridget on the Life and Passion of Our Lord and the Life of His Blessed Mother.
5,This is a wonderful little excerpt,"I love this little book. I have never read the original, ""Revelations of St. Bridget of Sweden"" from which this excerpt was taken. The reason is I don't have the time. However, this book is beautiful and I have given it to others as gifts. Because it is tiny in size, people will take the time to read it. It really gives one a better appreciation of Christ's birth and passion."
5,Shadows (check it out),"Watched a screener of the film the other night. Good stuff, although rough around the edges. This really is a movie from the monster's point of view. If you want a horror film with more then blood and guts, then you will enjoy this."
5,Strength FOR The Struggle,"Buy this book for Chapter Three alone, but be sure to read the other words of wisdom. Yes, as the previous reviewer said, it is chocked full of Biblical references but it is not just written for religious leaders. It can be applied to all aspects of leadership and inspires-in the words of the author-""leaders who happen to be women"" to stand strong against the stigma of ""stepping out of place"" into positions of power and authority. And while the focus is on women's leadership, the fellas can get a few shots of leadership adrenaline from this work also. I have had the honor and pleasure of hearing Bishop Mackenzie speak. Her writing is as powerful as her oratory skills. She has written the spiritual pep talk we all need. She could have easily called the book Strength FOR The Struggle."
5,A nice toy,"I got this for my daughter when she was four. She only plays with it at times, but it is a nice toy. The nursery at our church has it and it is a big hit and is holding up nicely."
4,Great train with sweet song,"I almost didn't buy this train to accompany the Fisher Price zoo. When I heard the great music, however, I quickly purchased it. It has a beautiful, SOFT, song that plays when the button is touched. It is not motorized, which I also liked. The animals included are adorable and durable. This is a great toy by itself, or with the matching zoo."
3,Zoo train,"My daughter received this train for her birthday. She seems to enjoy taking off the characters but then can't put them back on, same with the train which comes apart. It's a nice toy but in my opinion doesn't offer much educational."
2,Not very fun,"Our daughter has this toy. She was 6-months-old when she got it and is now over 2. She still gets bored with this toy within 2 min. of starting to play with it. The only thing she seemed to enjoy was the catchy little tune that it plays. Cute to look at on her bookshelf, not much of an educational toy."
5,Fun toy & great Fisher Price customer service,"My daughters 1 & 4 love this toy and all Little People products. Great for role play and even better with the Fisher Price Zoo. The main reason I'm writing however is to praise Fisher Price. I broke the battery compartment on this toy while installing new batteries (I overtightened the screw and the cover and part of the train cracked). I fully expected to pay for a replacement part, but instead Fisher Price said they would send me a new train. This company's customer service is just as outstanding as its products."
4,Cute toy,I have always loved the little people toys so when I found this toy at a consingment shop for $6 I was thrilled and had to buy it for my 10 month old daughter. She loves carrying around a little construction man from the old version of the little people (he was mine when I was little) so I thought she would love this also. Her favorite thing to do is to put their head or feet in her mouth and crawl around. I would worry but since they are big enough I am not afriad she will choke on them. They are just the right size for her little hands. She is able to take the train apart and it often falls apart when she tries to rip the animals off of it. They don't come off really easy. But this doesn't stop her. She also loves the song it plays. It doesn't keep her attention for very long (about 5 minutes max) but that is about all she gives any toy. The best part for me is that she loves to roar with the lion in the song. Cute toy!
3,The older the better,"Our little guy did not like this toy much when he was younger. He got it for his first birthday and only liked the little animals. Now he's 20 months and he loves it. He understands it's a train and moves all the pieces around and will play with it on and off all day! Sometimes, age is everything."
3,not what I expected,I have only been hunting with squirrel dogs for about 6 years and I am hooked bad.I had heard about Full Cry from some coon hunters I know and after reading the reviews on how it has turned into a cur-fiest magazine I purchased it. I would recommend anyone who has never read one of these to find a recent copy and read it before buying. I don't know what I was expecting from the magazine but not what I got. It is basically a group of letters from various hunting associations presidents and former presidents from the eastern part of the US. This was only my first copy and I gave it a 3 because hunting season is about to start and hopefully there will be more interesting things for them to write about other than the weather and who has passed away this summer.
3,Princess Diary Accurate Review,"Ok ive always Liked ythe princess diary books . This one is just the same as the other ones though. the plot is always OMG Im a princess who likes this guy but theres a little trouble with our relationship, funny remark, OMG what did Lilly do now?, funny remark, obsess over boyfreind, obsess over Lilly problem,funny remark, sigh my life sucks, my boyfreind wants what?, obsess, dramatic moment, oh i misunderstood, ok still whats wrong with lilly?THE ENDspecial thanks to...Ok it was ok but seriously dont watch the princess diaries moovy."
4,princess party,"Mia is back, and starting her sophomore year. Michael is off at college. Mia is ready for a great year, but naturally, things go wrong. She is in major trouble because she dumped millions of snails into the Genovian Bay in an attempt to help with the ecosystem. Now Genovia is in danger of being kicked out of the EU! Lily nominates her for student council president without her permission, and she's running against Lana! She even has to do a debate.... Lana also whispered to Mia about exactly what college boys expect of their girlfriends, and now Mia is terrified that she'll lose her boyfriend. With boyfriend worries, crazy campaigns, Genovian trauma, and her best friend secretly conspiring with her grandma, can Mia come out on top...or is her sophomore year doomed from the start?"
1,Pretty sad actually...,"If you ask me, this series should have ended after the 3rd book. I mean really, how long can Ms. Cabot go on about a girl who becomes a princess? Its not like it was the most original idea anyway.Not that I didn't like the books when they first came out, mind you. They weren't anything profound, but at least they were fun. What really turned me off about this book (besides the utter lack of real character development and Mia constantly whining like a spoiled brat) was Michael's pressuring Mia into sex. The overall theme of this book is quite clear: Its perfectly fine if you as a young woman don't want to have sex with your boyfriend right away, but you'd better have sex with him soon or he's gonna dump you and it will be all your fault. I am sure that Cabot did not mean to present this message, but she did.I hope that this series gets its spark back, although that may just be wishful thinking..."
1,repulsive,"im only going to comment on one thing because it basically ruined the whole book for me. Michael pressuring Mia into sex and Mia whining about it throughout the whole book. Okay, Michael is 18 and Mia is 15. The age of consent in NY is 17. if these two have sex its called STATUTORY RAPE. it is a CRIME and Michael will go to JAIL. but meg cabot is writing about it like its perfectly normal and acceptable for a high school sophomore and a college guy to have sex. and by the way, this book is marketed to 8 year olds.NOT COOL. if i could give it a 0 i would.Btw i listened to this as an audiobook w/clea lewis as the narrator. just the cutesy way she whines about not wanting to 'do it' throughout the book makes it obvious that the author doesnt even take teenage sex seriously. she just keeps writing this garbage to titilate curious preteens and sell more books."
2,dubious,"i found all of the previous books to be fun, and a bit of a naughty addiction. However, on getting to this one, i was nothing short of revolted. the moral of the story - sorry mia, you need to have sex with me eventually - is pretty much the Most inappropriate thing to be telling to teenage girls. it's not about pre-marital sex, but about choice, and feeling pressured. how long has sex education practically made girls chant 'no means No. no means No.' contrasted with this idea that well, michael is a boy, so of course he wants to have sex, and he needs to, and if she doesnt want to give out, then, well, she is just, like, dumped. and lame. really good work there, cabot."
3,Hooray for Mia!,"I cheered at the end of this book. You just know that Mia has it in her. (I won't say what, but if you're a devoted reader of this series, you'll be happy to know.)I give this 3 stars because it's not up to par with the first four books. The one before this and this one were/are on shaky ground. The pop culture references are fast and furious, and as a writer who will throw a few in from time to time, I was getting upset. It's a book, not an advertisement for music."
2,Not nearly as good,"Unlike the the previous novels in this series this book is simply mediocre. Don't get me wrong I am a huge Meg Cabot fan, yet in this book, Mia (the main character) seems to have become more shallow. The ""problems"" and their resolution are rushed and too easy. Mia is no longer someone that people can identify with."
4,Really Good,"I loved this book. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because my favorite princess diaries book is the third one where michael tells mia that he loves her.Anyway, this book is really good. It is so funny. Mia gets in trouble for dumping 10,000 snails in the Genovian bay, Lilly nominates her for student council president and michael wants to have sex with her. A really great read. I can't wait for Meg's next installment to come out."
3,Semi Dive Sticks,"My son is learning to swim and I bought these so he could dive down into the shallow water and retrieve them. Unfortunately, only 2 of the 4 sticks sink. The other 2 are made to float. I was disappointed about this. I guess my definition of dive sticks is that all of them should sink to the bottom of the pool. Right now, only 2 of the 4 are usable for us. If I would have known this, I wouldn't have purchased this item. But they are cute and my son does enjoy the 2 we use."
2,"Good toy, but not as described.","My 4 1/2 year old enjoys these, but I rated them low because they are not as described. There are only 4 character sticks in the pack as on the photo (I had thought maybe the other two were on the back side of the packaging). Also 2 of these float on the water, so only 2 sink to the bottom. I had really wanted sticks to dive down for."
2,Ugly American Story,"I purchased this book hoping to get a good description of life as an English Teacher in Korea. What I got was a short novel describing 3 teachers going to Japan to get drunk.There were a few points where the narrator drops the analogies (most of which are stolen from bad westerns or dime store detective novels) and the constant references to Beetle's music, and starts to go into the history between Korea and Japan. Those few passages are well written and very informative.However, as a whole, this book is a good example of the kind of behavior from tourists (and expats) that perpetuates those Ugly American stories."
3,Skinemax goes ultraviolent,"The beautiful and frequently topless Makiko Kuno plays an assassin raised by a deviant blind priest to be a warrior of God. But the killings are political, the priest works for the mob and two magazine photographers stumble across the whole mess. One gets killed, the other escapes only to be stalked by the beautiful assassin. The plot is pretty familiar and the film is shot in the style common to Japanese movies of this type: lots of monochrome, cool blues and bled out greens to suggest an arid, sterile moral wasteland. The blend of Gonin-esque ultraviolence and Skinemax gratuitous nudity makes it entertaining, though on a slightly silly level. And Kuno, in tight mini skirts and high heels, packing heat... Ouch!"
3,Beautiful Hunter,Decent fare from Japan. I'll have to watch it again and update this review next time...
1,me no likee!!,what a load of complete utter total piffle - about as entertaining as an afternoon at foot clinic - if shes beautiful my MRS is Miss Universe!!!
3,Floors a bit cleaner with this mat,"This mat is good for removing dirt. It does not seem to absorb wetness. It is helpful for my dog's feet with dirt, but it leaves wet paws prints on my hardwood floor."
3,battery charger,"ok but does not have auto shut off on 6 volt setting and a drop from 12"" hi dislodged red led bulb to inside"
4,"Subdued, Profound Performance","""A Single Man"" is set in Southern California during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. It follows a day in the life of George Falconer (Colin Firth) an English professor, who is also a secretly gay man. He is overwhelmed by the death of his partner of 16 years and in a deep depression. There is no joy in life. Every day he wakes up to ""now"", which is a day without his partner. He is not in a position to grieve openly but grieves constantly inside.He quietly and carefully plans for his death at the end of the day. The story is subdued, but a study of a man's grief and glimmers of hope. The acting and direction are impressive, and the cinematography is absolutely high art.No matter what your background, Firth's performance makes a profound impression.It also has an outstanding supporting cast that includes Juliane Moore, Matthew Goode, and Nicholas Hoult."
2,.Hard to Enjoy,"I rented the movie because I believe that Colin Firth is an amazing actor. Well, the movie probably had great acting but found the content or subject matter disturbing"
3,Melodramatic Junk,"If this movie didn't look so cool, there would be nothing redeeming about it. It seems that everyone this decade believes that during the mid-20th century everyone was repressed and miserable. ""A Single Man"" is no different. But to top it all off, this over-the-top take is almost operatic in its tragedy. The music score itself needs crackers to be swallowed. All of the characters apart from Mr. Firth's are stereotypes which are totally unconvincing. I watched it all, hoping that it would redeem itself in the end. It doesn't. I must say, that visually, it was great. Just mute it and enjoy."
2,Slow,"There were times when I found this movie to be agonizingly slow. I had to fast-forward the movie just to get it up to normal speed. I wouldn't have minded so much if the acting had been really compelling, but I just could never see Colin Firth as the character he was supposed to be playing (contrast that with how easily Sean Penn slipped into his character in Milk). At times I wasn't sure whether to laugh or cry. I certainly couldn't recommend this movie, unless you are really into gay romance flicks."
2,I don't get the hoopla.,"I'll admit the movie had a bit of merit, but I do mean a bit and it was so convoluted with going back and forth in time and imagined sequences it was also hard to follow.I thought Colin Firth did a good job, but not any better than most well educated actors could do."
1,bore,"I gave up when ten minutes into the film the protagonist is shown sitting on the potty reading a thick book with soaring classical music. This was followed by endless scenes of grieving hysteria wailing, running through rain in wet shirts, etc. etc. Enough is enough."
4,Dark and convincing,"A bit heavy handed with pretentious visuals, A Single Man is saved by its dialogue, which is often very sharp, and by some wonderful acting by the principles. Colin Firth hits all the right notes as a man who has lost the love of his life. Julianne Moore is splendidly over the top as an aged beauty. The interaction between these two actors is fabulous. The background music, mostly Eastern European sounding waltzes, seems out of place. The dream sequences were so overdone that they took me away from the story. Those criticisms aside, if you want to see real grown ups interact like real adults who have experienced loss, this movie will likely appeal."
2,Beauty is truth and truth is beauty - John Keats,"I excitedly approached Tom Ford's film with full knowledge of Tom Ford design and his radiant talent. Unfortunately, this review isn't based an original, Gucci horsebit handbag still in the box in my closet, but on his first film. In Ford's film, beauty takes center stage and depth is transparent. Ford seems all too accustomed to lifeless, pale, teenage models on and off the runway. Quite sadly, this film makes me ponder Ford's depth in all regards. After all, the pieces which speak to me in film, art, or fashion carry stories, history and even our humanity. Take note Ford."
2,Tom Ford's Obsessions (get it?),"As a director, Tom Ford is one hell of a fashion designer. This film makes me wanna buy cologne, or maybe a lamp. Good looking cast, lots of them shirtless. Now those are some cool shades, my friend. Can't wait for this movie to be released in catalogue form. Amen."
3,Mine's a double...,"A quite intriguing film on many levels. I'm not quite surewhy it works (it's so very 60's English) and the settingdid take me by surprise. Shows how much I knew of Isherwood'sworks!Firth is superb in the title role; his is a measured andunderstated performance. The cinematography is wonderfuland beautifully evokes the early 1960's, so much so thatat times I did ponder whether perhaps the cinematographerhad imagined the film in black and white.The subject matter, whilst not entirely a rarity in modern-daycinema, evokes an era of whispers and subterfuge. Hard tobelieve, across the decades, how repressed society really was.You might need a stiff drink during this film."
4,Liked it,This film was beautiful. It's packed with tons of emotion and I enjoyed the storyline though at times it was painful to watch.
5,Profoundly Beautiful Film,"This film ultimately is about being human, and recognizing the small, unplanned moments of beauty in life. The period detail from the 60s is perfect, and the characters are wonderful. The fact that the main character George is gay is largely irrelevant, in that this movie is not about being gay...it is about feeling deeply happy when we are able to connect with another that we feel understands us and cares about us ""as we are"". It is not flashy, not ""trying to make a statement,"" and therein lies its excellence. Watch the extras about the ""Making of..."" I appreciated Tom Ford's style before this movie, and now after it, I appreciate his skill as a Director even more.This is a beautiful film to watch when you are in the mood to think deeply about the things that really matter...I did not want it to end."
5,This is a sensitive and intriguing drama.,"Colin Firth is very convincing in this movie as man who's long time lover has passed away. Because of this event, Firth's character George Falconer is totally lost in this world and is contemplating what to do about it. The film captures the mood of the era of the 60's and it's stifling social environment. It's a beautifully shot film."
5,"Stunning, perfect.","Visually and emotionally stunning. At first I was not sure, but as it progressed it drew me in. I craved a Hollywood happy ending, but it did not happen yet I still felt satisfied at the end. Really a beautiful film. A must see."
1,What a waste of time,"Colin Firth spends a couple of hours feeling depressed and wanting to kill himself.By the end of the film, I felt exactly the same.What a pointless exercise in self-indulgence."
1,A single star,"One of the reasons for watching this film, aside from the many positive reviews was to see Colin Firth act. He does not disappoint although his talents are wasted in this poor movie. Firth is a Professor of English coming to terms with the death of his partner of 18 years against the backdrop of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Most of the action takes place on a single day, when Firth makes a plan to end his suffering. So during this day he has a host of sequences where he meets a lot of characters who add nothing substantial to the film and a dinner date with his long time friend Julianne Moore with a horrible English accent. Tom Ford the director is apparently a famous person but I had never heard of him until I saw the film. This is a horribly written and directed film, I had trouble keeping my eyes open and watched it one hand of the fast forward button. Nothing about this boring and pretentious film made sense. A single star only because I have to rate this film. 2.12.11"
1,"A Conceited film, totally disapointing","This film FAILS because of the 'perfume ad' vision of the director, a poor story (novel) which the director changed out of all recognition, and actors who completed it (in the director's words) in just 21 days.Colin Firth plays himself TOTALLY, not a gay man; Julianne Moore does her best 'Belle Watling', the FEW other characters are transparent to the extent that the best performance is by the dog!In a series of confusing flashbacks all the actual 'action' (lethargic as it is) takes place in 24 hours. The only change of visual pace includes scenes of 'death in snow' and 'almost drowning', and a fire-red sky owing much to 'Fargo', 'The Piano' and 'Gone with the wind'.As for the music, it's pretentious, saccharin sentimental, and more suited to Anna Karenina than a film set in California in 1962!Don't waste your money.A Single Man"
1,nice clothes but plotless movie,"Watch the trailer. This is all the plot you will get out of this movie. Only buy this movie, if you into fashion and 60th design architecture and cars."
1,Slow h0m0 movie that puts you to sleep ...,"I'm willing to watch almost anything, & got this due to preview on another movie.BIG MISTAKE !I fast forwarded throught it & am now giving it away.2 buns down ...My toilet is more interesting.:("
2,Slow Motion,"A very draggy (no pun intended) film with surreal photography, difficult to decipher British accents and male to male eroticism. Beautiful violin music and some humor--but not a lot. Expect to encounter scenes of males kising and TUSHES EXPOSED. The theater on an opening day late afternoon screening in Baltimore was pretty well-packed, but oddly enough there was no visible or audible audience reaction."
2,"Lugubrious, and what happened to the second dog?","This film is very stylish with some gorgeous scenes and flashes of brilliance, but that will only carry you so far before boredom sets in. I think the editor needs a serious talking to -- all those scenes of naked bodies floating in water set to violin music may have seemed interesting at the time, but I was leaping for the fast-forward button on a regular basis. [WARNING, POTENTIAL MINOR SPOILER] At the beginning of the film the bereaved Mr. Firth is informed that one of his dogs was found dead at the scene along with his lover, but the issue of what happened to the second dog is a total loose end that never comes up again. Laugh if you will, but the character, who is obviously very affected by the love for and memory of his dogs, would have made an effort to find that missing dog who was the last link to his dead lover. I don't know if this was a flaw in the novel or the film, but it deeply irked me."
2,Note enough for me...,"As the movie plodded along I found myself not caring how the film ended. But in the end I found some of the existentialism to be rewarding, if not particularly worth wading through the film for."
5,Unrest,This is a beautiful album. Classic Unrest here. The songs are both happy and sad at the same time. I wish the band got a little more popular so more people could realize how good they are!
4,Great classic indie album.,"This music has a Joyous warm minimalist chunky/jangly guitar appeal. The songs are all stripped down and simple, but contain a style that was just slightly too cool to be ""radio-friendly"". 'Cherry Cream On', 'June' and 'Suki' are incredibly catchy and will be running through your mind all day after a listen. 'Champion Nines' in basically a funky bass line, a drum machine and what sounds like wind chimes that slowly turn into alarms. 'Sugarshack', 'Firecracker' and 'Electricco' are somewhat stripped down guitar based instrumentals. The extra tracks in the 2003 re-issue are kind of pointless, but somewhat interesting and worthy after you get used to them. Some great stuff on this album, I am really surprised you never see this on any ""best of"" or ""most influential indie rock"" lists."
2,"Not ""for engineers,"" that's for sure","I don't know how exactly this book is ""for engineers."" It covers the same things any other introductory C++ book does, except in a less intuitive fashion. Keep in mind that none of the examples in the book are geared toward a scientific audience; you'll find the same badly-designed and outdated string/vector/matrix classes, horrible memory management practices, and primitive console user interfaces found in any other C++ book... only for twice the cost.I bought this book for a ""scientific computation"" class at the beginning of the semester. What a waste."
4,nice old book,The book is a little old but this type if information won't be outdated for a while. I'm happy with it. It's a good intro to what I am starting to learn.
2,Not one of thier best,"I am a big 'Rovers fan from WAY back, and unfortunatly this one has none of the classics,not bad, but not for the people wanting to check them out for the first time."
3,Another Round - Irish Rovers,"This is only an average album, not great or terrible but in the middle."
5,tragically underappreciated,"A historical adventure story, permeated with echoes of the myth of Adonis, this novel brings a kaleidascopic array of first person narrators, each with their own journey, giving us a very broad picture of the world of ancient Greece during the Peloponnesian war. Each character is portrayed with loving detail and sympathy. The one character who's voice we never hear directly is the central character, Alkibiades, preserving the tantalizing sense of mystery and heroism that surrounds this character.The descriptions are stunningly vivid and the language heart-achingly poetic. One of Sutcliife's few books for adults; all are fantastic, and all are sadly underappreciated."
5,Great Historical Fiction and Wonderful Teaching tool,"Through the use of story woven together with historical bits, this book is a wonderful tool for teachers and I'm sure students will appreciate it as well. The author is an amazing story teller and, from what I've heard, her visits to schools are always educational as well as entertaining."
5,A Sweet Tidbit of History,"Although written for a young reader, even adults will enjoy this sweet tidbit of history during the FDRoosevelt era. It shows the hardships experienced during the depression, hardships which hit families so hard it makes you want to cry - yet there is a sweet slice of hope by two young girls. The one girl (main character) puts all her hope in ""one basket"" in a desperate means to help save others. This small book pulls you in and finds you cheering in your heart for the young girl. Very readable and very entertaining yet very realistic with history lessons within. A five star recommendation to buy and read!"
3,Not typical story,"I had heard this was a different story line and from previews could see that too. I enjoyed it though, it is a humorous take on the traditional story."
4,A pleasant twist on an old story.,"Scenery was very well done, clothing was appropiate for the story, acting was well done led by Julia Roberts. Outcome was a twist but in good taste."
5,Mirror Morrir,"I loved the movie, so I bought it for my daughter who is 50th. She has watched it several times. Guess I will have to borrow it from her to watch it again."
1,I really wanted to like this movie.,"I really wanted to like this movie. I am a Julia Roberts fan but, this movie was pretty terrible. If you want to see a Snow White movie you should not watch this and watch Snow White and the Huntsman."
1,I do NOT have this product!,I do not have this product. I never ordered it. So how can I rate it when I haven't even seen it
2,Full of old punch lines. Departs from the original story in an unoriginal fashion. Not Julia Roberts best performance.,The Magic of the story is not found in this version. Full of old punch lines. It departs from the original story in an unoriginal fashion and takes a leave for a seemingly political twist to turn a focus on taxes. Not Julia Roberts best performance. Disappointing.
3,Ok Movie,"This movie was OK, not the greatest. My general rule for a movie is that I stay awake during the whole time. I drifted off about halfway through this one and never recovered.Ok, better for kids."
2,Worst Snow White Adaptation I've Seen!,"I've seen three adaptations of Snow White, and this is the worst. It's not awful, it's just not as funny as I thought it would be. And it's pretty boring, overall."
2,"Mirr-ugh, Mirr-ugh","I wanted to like this movie. I have always enjoyed Julia Roberts films, and I love comedies. The whole time we were watching this one, though, I kept thinking, ""It should be funnier. It's rather painful, like watching the kid at the blackboard who can't quite get the right answer, but has to keep standing there, and it makes me feel BAD for him.""The jokes weren't fresh, the development wasn't rich, and overall, I was disappointed. Rent it if you are a Julia fan or liked the trailer, but I wouldn't recommend buying it. Meh."
5,Mirror Mirror,I loved this movie. I'm so glad that I was able to get it from Amazon. I live in a very small town and the nearest supercenter is 30 miles away. Thank you Amazon.
3,Pretty Good,The movie had some funny parts and the kids enjoyed but we all lost interest at certain points. The end of the movie was very good.
4,Mirror Mirror,Cute show...The downplayed indications of black magic is the only thing that really bothered me. My kids enjoyed it but my younger one was a little scared at the end but not too bad.
5,mirror mirror dvd,i haven't had the chance to watch it yet. but it looks like it will be great. it was sent in a timely matter and i would use them again
5,I LOVED this version of Snow White,"there are so many versions of this film and i have to say that by far this is one of the BEST. i laughed at how the kissing roles were switched it was so so funny, and the dwarfs were perfect. i will watch this movie again and again!"
2,Save your $,"Not worth your time or money, definitely expected more. Julia Roberts must not have even read the script before agreeing to this one."
2,Not as impressive as some might think.,"First of all, let me list the good qualities about this movie.The graphics are really cool on this movie, and the ""mirror mirror"" parts are really awesome to watch. Plus, some of the fighting sequences are entertaining.Now for the bad things.The writers of this film completely turned the story around, and the lessons about true TRUE love in the original are wiped out in this movie. Instead of being masculine, and courageous, the prince is feminine, and Snow White ends up fighting for herself. The dwarves are made out to be thieves, and Snow White joins them, and the spells and enchantments, which I normally like, are too wichcrafty for my taste. Overall, I would recommend to NOT buy this."
1,Sucked,This was one of the worst movies I have ever watched. Would not recommend this to anyone.... Did not even want to give it one star.
3,entertaining....but,"Not too bad of a job for this fairy tale. Nice colors, great costumes and for oncei can hack Julia Roberts as she finally lands a part that she can handled prettygood. So we have action, colors and lots of things...but it feels so empty...because all scenes were done inside the studios on different stages.Instead of having scenes done outside in the forest, they ended cutting treesdown and replanting them on a sound stage... They got away with the first scenein the woods, then all later scenes felt the same...same fake trees, fake snowfake fake fake. And all this fake does get to you."
3,May want to rent before buying,"This was an interesting take on the tale of Snow White. Seeing Julia Roberts as a ""bad guy"" was fun. Entertaining, but the character development could have been better. Kids will like it. The CGI was very good."
3,Cute movie,This movie was such a cute and funny movie. A great Family movie we really enjoyed watching it. I love Julia Roberts in any movie!
3,Very Average - Maybe Slightly Below,Stangely slow and flat even with it's moments of humor. Nice design and production with Lily Collins the best thing about the movie.
5,Good,"Good, not great but good. A fun adaption with a darn good cast. It misses on some marks, but it's hard to compare this to the storybook tale that Disney told. Doesn't make it a bad movie, just must view it on it's own as a separate story."
3,Tarsem Strikes Again!,- the photography - like many of this directors works - is spot on - great visuals but he lacks substance - somthings amiss - just like the 'Immortals' - great visuals but let down by storytelling and plot!
3,Wanted to like it...but,With the stars in the movie it should have been really good but alas it wasn't. I'm glad I didn't pay money to go see it at the movie theatre.
1,Did not like it at all.,The timming was way off and the story was not entersting. Julia Roberts was not funniny at all. Just did not work.
3,Mirror Mirror,"Its great for kides but I did not like it, for an adult film. it was a great film for my 9year old. but a bit to kiddish forme."
3,Eh,The disk was scratched so about 15 min. of the movie did not play. Next time I will spend the extra $10 and buy it new. I did receive my order quickly.
2,Not what I expected:,"I would give this movie 2.5, and only because Julie Roberts is in it. It was a little boring. I just did not like it."
2,Horrid Movie,"Over acted, boring and utterly perdictable. Normally, I love Roberts but she wasn't believable in this role. Also, the plot wasn't new or fresh."
2,"Mirror, Mirror",Mirror MirrorI didn't care for the changes that Hollywood made to the basic tale ofSnow White. I didn't believe that it enhanced it one bit.
2,Greatly lacking.,"While it was amusing to see Julia Roberts portray the Evil Queen, the film as a whole is greatly lacking. An interesting aspect is the twist on the portrayal of the Seven Dwarves. ""Prince Charming"" is a rather flimsy character. When Snow White manages to dance with him at the castle and tell him of her dilemma, he pledges to help her; however, he almost immediately decides she is insane and ought to be stopped. He is disdainful, arrogant, offensive, and ridiculous. This film could have been very strong; instead, it is glaringly lacking on so many levels. I cannot recommend it."
4,Entertaining,This movie was funny and entertaining! As an adult I appreciated the lesson of this old fairy tale. Lily Collins was excellent in this movie.
1,I really wanted to give it a chance...but please save your $$,"bad storyfake looking setbad actingnot worth your money, I expected much more from a movie with Julia Roberts and Sean Bean!"
1,Seriously Bad,"I am a big Julia Roberts fan, but Oh My God, what a terrible movie. I cannot believe that I just wasted almost two hours of my life on such nonsense. The adaptation is silly and poorly written. The annoying weird dog-acting of the prince is not funny, well, maybe for kids it is... The Snow White is uninspiring and dull. The queen is bored and boring. The Prince, even though very hot I have to admit, seemed stupid and lost. The only character that was actually fun to watch was Nathan Lane's Brighton. The ending song seemed like creators' desperate, but failed, attempt to add spark to a dull image. This movie is nothing but a waste of Julia Robert's talent. What a disappointment."
1,Mirror Mirror,"To begin with, I didn't mean to purchase this as a down load. Second, I haven't been able to download the film.So how can I rate something that I haven't seen and didn't mean to purchase. I would accept a CD but I don't think you would do that now."
4,I watched it the first time for the costumes....,"...and probably the second time as well. At that point I was rather taken with the characters and wanted to watch it again...in time. If you like elegant sets, great supporting cast (Nathan Lane can steal almost any show) and a charming, if not predictable tale, get the fuzzy slippers out, light the fire place and...well, this ""cute"" movie kit does not supply the person you cuddle with...because not every cuddly companion will be as caught up in the visuals as you...so this movie is perfect for after a great meal...."
3,Mirror Mirror,"Cute movie, some moments a little boring but all in all a nice entertainment for kids and adults. Julia was fantastic as usual."
2,Don't waste your money,Really wasn't impressed with this movie. None of it made much sense. The acting was horrible. Don't waste your money.
3,Moderately entertaining.,"A re-telling of the classic Disney tale of Snow White receives a modern-day make over. The cast of characters is still largely the same, but this time Snow White is a little more independent and able to fend for herself against the evil god-mother. A valiant attempt at updating this tale works well at times, not so well at others. The film certainly looks terrific, with costumes and colorful sets that really bring a magical feel to the film. The humor in it sometimes falls flat as the attempt to be hip does not always work. The best movie's best asset is Lily Collins, who is absolutely delightful as Snow White. I would say that this is a movie that the kids will certainly enjoy and the adults who take them will find it entertaining enough."
5,"Not meant to be taken seriously, I laughed out loud.","I am a fan of originals; especially original movies. It is my opinion that in the remaking/retelling of a story, the original luster and charm that captivated us to begin with is lost in that quantum leap. However, Julia Roberts and Lily Collins shined in this wit-filled, slightly off kilter film. There are many remarks spoken under breath, some that made me laugh out loud; and let me tell you, that is no small feat. I thoroughly enjoyed this classic tale, shaken with a twist."
5,MIrror Mirror,Story line was good. Very nice twist from the original story. The approach to changing of the original story line was very good and very well done. I enjoyed this movie alone and would like to share it with my grand kids soon. Thank you for asking for this review. I really recommend this movie to anyone.
4,Fun,It was not a complete waste of time. Very funny in spots and the 7 Dwarfs were great. Julia Roberts is always good. Lily Collins could use some acting lessons though.
3,OK.,"This movie was with subtle comic moments. The satire was good too. But, I guess I expected more from Julia Roberts. Anyway, part of the fun was lost because I was cheap and didn't watch th e movie in HD."
2,terrible,"The two stars are only for the special effects. Except for Julia Roberts, the acting is sub-par. The plot rambles and the script is full of comedic cliches."
3,Julia,"great acting, entertaining, average to a little better fun movie - love julia. word another word an additional word to reach 20 - silly rule."
5,Great Family Movie,"The movie was adorable and funny. It was the perfect movie for the whole family to enjoy. I have a 9yr old boy, 10 yr old girl and 12 yr old boy and they all liked it. The humor and fighting scenes kept the boys interested while the strong princess character, beautiful costumes and humorous scenes kept my daughter wanting more. I highly recommend this movie for families."
4,Kinda Cute,A Bit of a different take on the story. Not painfull to watch. and we enjoyed it.. Made for a good movie to kill a saturday eve. while keeping the cost down..
3,Too many bad changes,Some things just shouldn't be changed... Names of main characters were changed and the types of the characters were changed and some of the good guys took on a more bad character role. The other changes were good however do overall good movie for families
4,Yup - I liked this,I enjoyed this - watched it twice. Nice storytelling and good acting! Didn't purchase this - free to watch on the OTHER movie streaming website. Will buy it when the price comes down.
5,Mirror Mirror,Great movie if you really like the snow white cinderella fairy tales. Great twists and turns and who knew Julia Roberts could be so evil! he he he
3,not bad,"The costuming was better than the movie, and I probably enjoyed the Bollywood-inspired number in the credits more than the rest of it."
2,Mirror Mirror,It was not the type I thought it would be.Mirror Mirror I did not lie Julia Roberts in that type of movie. Title is Mirror Mirror
3,Decent movie.,Light and airie fare that provided a modicum of laughter. Movie plot better than expected and significantly different to Snowwhite and the huntsman.
4,dont own but want to now,"rented this movie from redbox last night. it started off kinda slow but then it got better, i thorougly enjoyed this movie so cute and fun a new twist on the fairy tale and i love fairy tale retellings. the song at the end is so very catchy i bought it on itunes. i like how this princess is no damsel in distress she doesnt sit around to b rescued by a prince. yes i though it was good and im 30 years old but i would def recommend it, now i got to save up to buy this dvd"
2,Expected charming but found it repulsive,"I rarely turn a movie off but I just couldn't even have this playing in the background. What a waste of film, time and talent. Julia Roberts was Julia Roberts as the evil stepmother, not one bit of acting involved. Armie Hammer was pretty to look at but drab as a dishrag. The girl who played Snow White, I didn't even bother to learn her name. I ALWAYS watch a movie through to the end but I couldn't find one thing redeeming about this and I really, really tried. Definitely not a Disney or Pixar movie. What a huge disappointment!"
4,Cute Movie,"I enjoyed the movie, thought it was cute. It was interesting to see Julie Roberts as the ""bad guy"", she did a great job."
2,Poor acting and story development,The acting and story development in this movie was poorly done and despite having an audience of three women at various ages no one was watching it by the end.I give the movie two stars because it did not appear to damage my TV.
4,totally fun!,"I don't know why the negativity! This was just as fun a remake as ""hook"" was to Peter Pan! My girls and I thought this was a delightfully fun movie and plan on owning it in our library. Then again, I am partial to Julia Roberts."
5,Fun movie for the family!,"Great movie! Entertaining and fun for the whole family. A new twist on a classic, but well executed. Costumes are scenery are dazzling."
1,Simply awful!!!,"Stay away from it!!! It's the most boring movie I have ever seen! This movie was neither humorous nor dramatic, they try to mix both genders at the same time and the result are 100 minutes of nonsense and torture!!! It is a pathetic attempt to innovate. If you don't believe me buy it, but be prepare to hear I told you so. Don't throw away your money, I think it should be better spend in a charity. With all due respect to all those who enjoy this movie they should go to the psychologist ASAP!!!"
1,Horrible movie,Could not believe how stupid and horrible this movie was. To have a big name actress as Julia Roberts I was very disappointed!!
1,What a terrible movie!,"This movie is absolutely terrible. It is a re-telling of the Snow White fairytale and unfortunately the script is just aweful. Surprisingly all the actors were bland, and just plain boring. Perhaps the bad script, in combination with poor directing? The movie never gives you that wow factor. What a shame. Save your money on this one.P.S. Im 31, and I didnt like it. My daughter is 14, and she didnt like it. And my son who is 12, says he really didnt care for it. We are looking forward to seeing Lily Collins in The Mortal Instruments movies, but Mirror Mirror was just bad :("
1,"Just Awful, Just Awful","I figured going in this movie was going to be bad, but how bad was yet to be seen. I watched almost 30 minutes of this terrible movie and could stand no more. I seldom stop watching a movie after I have started, but this was an exception. I don't think even children would enjoy this. This was a waste of time, money, and talent. Avoid this horrible piece of work at all cost. I would not even watch it when it comes to TV."
2,Just Not Good,"I was looking for something smart with good character acting...I mean, we all know the story. Instead, the script was unimaginative and cute (not my taste). Julie Roberts seemed to be marking time in her role. It was background noise for making dinner though. So, not entirely without value."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"Since I am a fan of Julia Roberts, I was hoping that it was a decent movie. However, when it did not last very long at the theaters, I became a little skeptical. Thank goodness I was wrong, especially considering all of the recent fairy tale movies that have come out."
4,Made me laugh a bunch,I rented this to watch on the plane to Chicago. It was well worth the $3.99 or whatever! I'm considering buying it!
2,Disappointing,The story line wasn't bad but actress who played Snow White was horrible and distracting. The movie did drag at times...I wont be buying this one for my collection but it was on okay rental.
2,Mirror Mirror,"Girlfriend wanted to watch it and since there was nothing else on TV, or Netflicks or Huluplus we rented this movie. I fell asleep during parts of the movie. Not a fan of Julia Roberts."
5,A Great DVD!,"I did not have the chance to see this in the theater so I was excited to see this on DVD. Seeing that my family are large Disney Fans, I was intrigued at how they would portray Snow White and the story that Disney took on so many years before. I was very impressed with this updated telling of the story and even more impressed with the acting within the movie. Julia Roberts does an amazing job as the Wicked Queen and you can tell that she had a ton of fun playing the character as well. Even beyond the BIG name actors (Such as Roberts) the film brings together a wonderful cast that simply makes the entire movie click and work. I was quite impressed throughout the movie and if you are a fan of the snow white story, this will be one you should pick up today!"
2,Flat and not entertaining,"I was disappointed by almost everything in this movie. I couldn't watch past the first 45 minutes, the script was lame. The attempted humor fell flat. This had all the elements to make it a much better movie, and didn't take advantage of any of them. Sorry I paid for this one."
3,Grandkids liked it,"Our 3 grandkids liked the movie, It was cute and had a nice spin on an old story. Julia Roberts was good and the evil stepmother. All in all an entertaing movie for the whole family."
4,SNOW WHITE IS AUDREY HEPBURN?,"This movie started somewhat slow and that didn't help with the fact that I had to sit through a chick flick at my girlfriend's request (her choice that night). This chick flick came through quite well.This movie was saved by two things: The first was the acting of Nathan Laine; and, the second was by the return of Audrey Hepburn to the big screen.My girlfriend and I soon found ourselves laughing out loud with the antics of Laine and the seven dwarfs.This is a good date night movie that will give you time to work on your popcorn at the beginning.Watch it, and tell me that the beauty of Audrey Hepburn doesn't return to the big screen. I dare you!"
3,Costumes and scenery are the show,"Mild humor, costumes and scenery are this show. The ladies are the strong characters, the evil queen, Julia Robert's character, is intelligent. Snow white takes a while to catch on."
3,Ok Movie,The movie was ok. It had it good moments and not so good moments. I am glad I waited for the DVD.
1,A waste of time,This movie was a waste of my time and money. There were so many failed attempts at humor that it was just painful to watch. This surely isn't one of Julia Robert's best roles. Snow White was not believable as a heroine at all. I suffered through the remainder of the movie only because I paid to watch it.
1,Not the best movie,"This movie has characters but they don't have emotions there more like robots Julia Roberts does a horrible job as the evil queen, and Lily Collins is a little irritating in this movie,mthey prince was boring, and the dwarves were just plain annoying. The plot could have been written by 5 year old for all we know, over all don't waste your money on this movie wait for it to show on tv in 2 years."
2,2 Stars Cause My Kids Laughed,"Seriously. That's the ONLY reason I gave this movie 2 stars. My boys, aged 6 and 8, laughed and giggled through most of this film while their Father and myself felt like we were being labotimized...forcibly...without anethesia. Julia Roberts is SO much better than the acting in this movie, and I am NOT a Julia Roberts fan. Still, when all's said and done, this movie was sex and profanity free (barring a face licking scene that was more gross than perverted), made the kids laugh, and in today's movie climate, that's deserving of at least an extra star."
1,Worst I've Seen in a LONG Time,"This movie was simply atrocious! I mean, BAD! REALLY bad!! And oh my gosh did it DRAG! My wife and I forced ourselves to finish this only because we paid $5 to rent it on Vudu. Big mistake. Do not pay to see this movie. Period.Terrible CGI, terrible acting, ridiculous and childish elements like the dwarves on stilts. WHAT?? Pathetic dialogue.Don't. Just don't."
1,want it back,"I want my $3.99 & my 1:45:52 back. So bad I didn't even pause it when I left the room. Just wanted it to be over. Then to top it off with a Bollywood closing...really? Really.Save your money...but most importantly, your time."
3,A change of pace,"As I watched this movie with my girlfriend on a date night I realized that she would likely enjoy it more than I. However, I was delighted when I found it equally enjoyable. It was slightly comedic. There were moments where I had a good laugh. The story line was a unique twist in comparison to other renditions of the story. Seeing as I rented this for $3.99 it was definitely worth the money."
4,great movie,Fun for the family. Visually stunning. Six year old girl and her eight year old brother both enjoyed the film. So did mom and dad.
3,SNOW MUST FALL,"A contemporary spin on a familiar tale and a glib sense of humor make MIRROR MIRROR an entertaining film. Julia Roberts plays the Wicked Queen with a devilish cynicism and narcissistic flourish. Lily Collins is both demure and flirtatious as Snow White and Armie Hammer is a fine Prince. Nathan Lane is delightful as the Queen's bumbling aide and Mare Winningham is fun as the baker lady. All of the seven dwarves/bandits are perfectly cast, each having distinctive persomalities. The movie is visually impressive, capturing a mystical fairy tale landscape. My main complaint is the movie's over use of lengthy sword fights, which seemed to serve as padding.Overall, MIRROR MIRROR is a fun diversion with a wide appeal."
3,Good for Kids,Slow but cute little movie that takes a different twist on the typical Snow White story. The costumes and set are lavish and imaginative. A little silly in places but sweet and entertaining overall. Clean family viewing you don't see often enough.
3,no a second watch,"With one watch was enough. I think it was in the middle of stuff for kids and stuff for adults. I love Julia, but the rest was just fine."
3,ehh,"it was ok. i knew it was going to be light hearted and kinda corny. it was. julia roberts did great. overall the movie was only really worth a few bucks to see maybe, might even be a dollar rental movie"
5,Campy fun,"I enjoyed this movie. It is ""campy fun"" and easy on the eyes. I will enjoy comparing the Seven Dwarves in this movie with the heroes of ""The Hobbit"" movies."
3,Mirror Mirror,The trailer had all the good part. I am glad I did not spend money at a theater. Definitely not what I expected.
2,Snow White with a Disappointing Twist,"I am very thankful I rented this movie instead of buying it. It seemed to be mildly entertaining from the many commercials I have encountered, but it was actually worse. Although, it was somewhat quirky and funny at times. Other than that Julia Roberts was a very disappointing wicked witch, and the main parts that were plainly differing from the original Snow White were worse than the original. The whole movie just seemed awkward to me. Maybe Snow White and the Huntsman will prevail in being much more entertaining."
4,Watch the end credits.,"I have one thing to say, since all of the other critics have fairly well hashed out what this movie was good for or not... watch the credits. There is a great little music video in there, with possibly my favorite shot: Sean Bean looking askance at two dancing palace guards. Seeing Julia Roberts expressions during the party scene is absolutely priceless, too."
1,Robbing the Magic of a Classic,"Avoid this movie. It is another biased hollywood attempt to rob the magic out of a beautiful children's classic story. The innocence is gone, and the undertone's of violence toward men is grotesque."
1,very disappointing.,I was expecting much more from the excellent actors and director involved. Just never got off the ground for me.
1,Awful,"One word can describe this movie....AWFUL... Julia Roberts must be scratching for work! Don't waste your time or money! I wish I could return the dvd, but I gave it to my 12 year old neice."
1,Bored to tears....,"This movie was supposed to be good. I mean it has Julia Roberts in it, right? How bad could it possibly be? Shes a mega-star and stars like that wouldnt lower themselves to this cheese. RIGHT?!?! It was the worse movie she ever made. What was she thinking? I mean really what? I really really really wanted to like it. I'm a huge Julia Roberts fan, but this movie may have changed my mind about her. Atleast until she does another good movie."
3,It was okay,It was just okay. Tried to make it more a liberated version which I get for little girls to know they CAN do things for themselves...
2,Corny!,"This movie was not what i expected...kind of corny. Do not want to see again. But see it for youself, who knows u may like it."
5,love it,kgjt'oidfj dlkfgjeopifj ldkfjagtropisfj ldkjygoji dlkgrj'ljobdkl'j lkgh'fljbt'kl;j kl;dfjhg;pjb ;dgjposfbvjb;j d;fojgpobj dfkjkj dhj;jb dgjfdkj gkljhfkljbglbnkj lkjfghlkj lkjfgh'lgj lkfnhjgjkl klgjh
3,It was cute...,"But a little bit to cuddly and contemporary for my taste.It is a re-telling of the classic Snow White fairytale, but updated. Sometimes and in some ways this is not a bad thing, and at times it works in this movie. Overall I hate to say it, but the movie tries to hard and in the end is just kind of forgettable. Although if you have children between 6 and say 14 it may not be."
2,There are better Snow White movies,"I give this movie credit for trying to put a different spin on the classic Snow White tale. However, the humor came across as a little cheesy."
1,Not Good,"Not funny. Not a good plot. Julia Roberts is an amazing actress but does not make a good witch. Prince Charming or whoever he is in the movie gets on a person's nerves acting like a dog and stuff. Just overall, a bad twist on Snow White."
1,Don't be tricked by Pre-Ordering,"I cancelled the order one day before it became available when it was emailed that I would receive Instant Viewing instead of the actual DVD, as I expected. However, I was charged for it anyway. I am not pleased with the false representation on the ""Pre-Order"" product. Obviously, it was unclear or intentionally misleading."
2,Seven bad years for breaking a mirror? May be worth the risk.,"So boring. I can't believe I watch the whole thing. Stupid need to finish stories. Ugghhh. TV show ""Once Upon a Time"" is infinitely better. Sad."
4,loved it,"it was great! my fave character was the queen, also i love that actor. it was good because they built the movie around the basic snow white love story, but it had more character and more action. i also loved the 7 dwarfs!"
2,Not worth the time ...,"I can honestly say this is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. Children may enjoy it, but it doesn't provide much in the way of adult entertainment."
2,Disappointed With Digital Copy,"I was surprised to discover that Walt Disney supplies only the STANDARD DEFINITION digital copy with their BluRay packages. This is very disappointing. It seems that the Ultra-Violet digital copy is true 1080p HD digital copy which is distributed by other studios. This was confimred by Disney and they did not seem to care that their competition was offering a true 1080p HD digital copy, and would not agree to upgrade my digital copy for Mirror, Mirror. BAD BUSINESS DECISION.."
3,fair attempt at a comedy,"I really wanted to like this film. It had some of my favorite actors in it and I really expected it to be good. Costumes were well done and and I liked most of the characters. The little bit of drama in this comedy didn't quite work. The scene going into the mirror didn't work for me. The prince didn't seem very smart and his acting like a dog looked too much like ""The 10th Kingdom"""
5,One of the Best of the Best!,"I love Julia Roberts and she was awesome as the evil queen I liked it mostly cause even my young 4 and 5 yr old grandchildren could enjoy it with me. I loved it...it was scary enough but not too, and funny. They loved it. We loved it !I esp loved the surprise ending...the dancing...don't want to give it away. So if you love Julia Roberts, as I do, you will love this movie; seven ""dwarf's"" and all ;) Great family movie. Something for all members of the family ;) Great show!! Loved all the special effects and all the scenery; it was just awesomely done...beautiful. Can't say enough. Thank you so much. I bought an extra copy to give my grand-daughters for Christmas ;) They will love it!! Its got the ""princess"" the ""prince"" the ""dragon"" just enough scares, some funnies, some serious, but all in all one of the best movies since ET :) ! Loved it. Can't say it enough. ;)You will be dancing too, in the end ;) lol Rated a 10 for Awesome!"
2,Mirror Mirror,When I purchased this movie if I had known the story line I would have never purchased this particular movie. The animated Disney version is 10 times better and if I could return it I would.
2,movie,"I was disappointed I suppose. Julia was not what I expected, however, I bought this move to watch with my grandchildren. I'm so happy she does good movies I can watch with them. There are so few anymore. I would buy this movie again of course....I wonder if she would make ""Beauty and the Beast""? I do love her movies..she makes movies we can all watch togeter as a family....unlike most of her peers."
3,The Dwarves With Charisma,"I watched this film with my nine year old granddaughter. Viewed through her eyes, it was the perfect film. A witchy stepmother Queen, the seven dwarves, beautiful Snow White,, and the prince. For adults it was a mostly listless tale.Julia Roberts and Nathan Land stole the show. Julia, the Queen, was the perfect protagonist, hateful and likable at the same time.Nathan Lane was there for the adults, his humorous riffs had me laughing, and kept me entertained. The Prince, Snow White, and the Queen, never seemed to jell. No charisma from SnowWhite or the Prince. However, the scene with the Prince acting like a puppy was his best. The seven dwarves seemed to genuinely like each other, and they were the hit of the film for my granddaughter. They had the charisma the rest of the film lacked.The music was well done, the art effects terrific! Essentially, this Grimm Fairy Tale was that, grim.Recommended for children. prisrob 08-20-12Runaway BrideMouse Hunt"
3,The Cast Is Fun,"This is a silly version of the tale, very comical. Unfortunately, the script lackswit and some of the slapstick is just infantile. It's enjoyable, nonetheless. Itjust could have been a lot better. The story is inventively retold, and both Snow andthe Prince are winning personalities. Julia Roberts' role, however, is written inone key throughout the film, leaving her with little to do other than affect a jadedcruelty that gets a bit tired. The dwarfs are the film's weakness, because their materialis the least interesting: they're supposed to be lovably feisty, like the Dead End Kids.There's an interesting twist near the end; see if you can guess it before it's revealed."
4,good collection,"If you like the sports or want to see what cummings did before his solo work, this is a very good compile of their work"
1,Electric tortilla maker,"I just received my electric tortilla maker, not completely satisfied.The dough sticks to the plate.I am thinking of returning the product.Not worth the price."
4,masster adj 3 hole punch 13/16,Purchased at Amazon. Punch is very good for the price. Must keep an eye on the settings. They may move if not careful. Shipping was expensive due to the weight I guess.
2,Eh,"You get what you pay for. It's a compatible cartridge, which means that you shouldn't expect anything other than just ok print quality."
4,Things we can not see,"The book describes the musicals produced from the beginning of talkies until about 1934. His descriptions are detailed and meticulous, with interesting comments. The only problem is that films of he writes we can not see, unless we have access to places like the file of Film and Television at UCLA. Films simply are not available to the general public. Except for a few like Broadway Melody of 1929 and the films of Busby Berkeley and Astaire-Rogers (thanks WB). So, we have to imagine about what he writes or see some shorts on YouTube."
5,"Fun adventure, and a must read vacation book","The themes and scenes found in this book are an uncanny mixture of Anne Rice and Hunter Thompson. All of the characters seem blindingly real, even those that simply could not be real, and the story line is strong, compelling, and makes one wish for a sequel when you turn that last page and reach the end! I always enjoy reading books with a local connection when I travel to a region, and I would at the very least recommend this book for anyone who plans to vacation in Yellowstone National Park or nearby areas! Not to suggest that this novel is in any way a travel guide.... but the setting of the Rocky Mountains, the grizzly bear habitat, and so on, are as key to this work as are the philosophical questions about religion, cultism, videography and sex!"
4,Sam and Company are back again,"The time hopping friends are back again, this time they are 1000 years in the past in Ancient Mexico. My kids love the Time Warp Trio. Knights of the Kitchen Table was the first chapter book my 8 year read, and he was hooked.This book is great for the reluctant readers (generally boys). Sam and company find adventure, play some sports, and have some fun with puns (as usual).I gave this book only 4 stars because some of the names in the story may be hard to pronounce for young readers."
2,Insubstantial,"This book was entertaining. My six-year-old listened to it avidly and thought it was funny. We read it as part of our homeschool unit on the Maya people. It did present some history, but I felt that the irreverant and flippant tone of most of the book was disrespectful and unnecessary (e.g. the character named ""Kakapupuhed""). The author seems to have the perspective that history is boring and needs to be made more interesting so that children will find it appealing. It was fun and it was funny, but I didn't think it was worthwhile for building his character or his understanding of history or other cultures."
2,It started out with promise...,"Eyewitness has a lot of material out there and this dvd seemed to have promise. It is mostly geared to the late elementary level, but is evolutionary in slant and at one point shows girls running down the beach in thongs - definitely not for the elementary age and I wouldn't show this to even high schoolers - seriously not appropriate for a dvd that is trying to be educational and go through the body systems."
4,Excellent history of a scary flood in Pennsylvania.in 1972,"This is an excellent visual history of a scary flood in Pennsylvania. The book, at 200 pages, contains hundreds of black and white photos taken of the 1972 flood in Wyoming Valley, Pennsylvania, after Hurricane Agnes passed. The flood caused huge amounts of damage. These photos are an excellent record.The entire area rebuilt to an amazing extent in the following years. This was despite the loss of the major industry in the area, hard coal mining, which nearly vanished in the late 1950s."
5,Great.,It was a good book. I probably won't use it very much though to be honest. Four words to finish. Done.
5,Hamm!,"I'm always looking for the perfect book of whatever variety, & speaking as a former library employee, a cartoonist & art teacher, Jack Hamm has written THE book on cartooning. It is so packed with examples & not so much text, as it should be, it has tips & then TONS of examples. The style ranges from early American cartooning style to 50s/60s modern style. Fantastic examples of different expressions, hand positions, walking positions, drawing women, all of it. All good. If you want a great guide for old fashioned American cartooning, this is the one to get. Then get the Preston Blair book from Walter Foster."
5,Cartooning the Head and Figure (Perigee),"Absolutely Awesome book! Talk about a all inclusive content of information? This book provides lots of pictures and clear presentation of cartoon relevant information. This book is a must for any serious artist , beginner to advanced.The book was reasonably priced and well worth the cost."
5,EASY WAY TO LEARN HOW TO PAINT CARTOONISH LIKE FIGURES,"I FOLLOW THE BOOK SEQUENCE, AND DRAW MY OWN CARTOON STYLE HUMAN FIGURES. IT'S EASY TO READ AN EASY TO FOLLOW. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK."
2,Don't like,Not what I expected cartoons did not give me the detail I was looking for to Carve & I don't like being told how long my response is
5,Excellent!,"I own most of Mr. Hamm's books now and all of them are excellent.Some caution though for comic book artists wannabes, this bookdoesn't teach you action oriented cartoons. Get ""Action!Cartooning"" by Ben Caldwell instead.However, Mr. Hamm's book is a classic because it's not just ahow-to book but rather a book founded on good art principlesconsidering Mr. Hamm isn't just a ""cartoonist"" but a trueartist.Get this book! You won't be disappointed."
5,They get you laid,"This is my 2nd pair; I will probably buy a 3rd. I wear them daily but not all day. I find that I need to replace flops or sandals periodically they tend to stretch and become lose on your feet plus they just get kind of nasty. They hold up just as long if not longer as any other flop or sandal I have; and why pay $50.00 for foot wear you are going to put on your bare sweaty feet and walk on top of.I have owned Reef as well as other brands and I find these to be my favorite and on my feet 90% of the time. I have looked at the Reef flops with the bottle opener built in to the bottom and really can't figure out why anyone would want to pull a dirty piece of FOOT WEAR off the ground and your foot, and open a bottle that you or someone is going to drink out of?"
3,Was ok-could have been better...,"This is a pretty fair horror movie. When you see the whole thing you look back and see so many places where it could have been so much better. The components where all there but instead of capitalizing on them, the director seemed to look for a way to tie the loose ends up quickly. Also it dragged in places particularly in the middle and lacked for deeper performances by the actors. Otherwise it is a fair movie with some good twists and turns."
3,ok,This is an ok movie. I have seen worse and I have seen better. The acting was not bad in this movie the story line was a bit over used.
3,Not for big girls,Ok... I was really wondering how this would work and know I know.. I am a 38DD and this product really wouldn't support me. The cups need to be made of something besides lycra. I wouldn't buy this if you can't go without a bra.
4,satisfactory,"This bra does relieve the feeling of having my rib cage strangled. However,for my short torso it is about 2 inches too long so it would be nice if it was offered in a shorter version. Also it doesn't ""lift"" my breasts even with the underwire like I had envisioned looking at the picture of the model."
5,A life saver,"This garment makes a huge difference in the way anything looks,and it feels so comfortable.When I do not have it on I really miss the held in feeling."
2,Buy something else.,"Disappointed with this toy. One of the switches on the truck stopped working the day after it was delivered by Santa and the knob that works the divider where the ""trash"" gets dumped into the truck stopped moving the divider within a month. I have two sons (2 and 4 years old)who this truck should have been perfect for, but it proved to be in-line with so many other cheaply made, plastic toys these days. I was hoping for more from the Tonka name."
2,disappointing!,"We recently gave this to our son for his second birthday. We already had the Mighty Motorized Fire Truck which is great and has always been a big hit with my son, so I was excited to find this. I have to say I am very disappointed in the quality - I expected better from Tonka. First of all the doors don't fully open, so my son can't get the men in and out - even my husband and I have trouble doing this. Once you get them men inside it's nearly impossible to have them sit in the seats - the space is just too small. The back door latch is faulty, and the horn/reverse beeps switch is reversed! We have not been pleased with this purchase"
3,Too bad it broke,"My almost 3 year old had been asking for a garbage truck for Christmas. I found this one at Toys R Us on sale for $20.00. It was the only one like it left. I picked this style thinking it wouldn't break as much as the ones that have the garbage container lift from the side. I was wrong. It worked for about 2 days and then the arm that lifts the forks back stopped working. Our son was very careful with it when playing too. I'm not impressed. He does love to still turn the knob on the side that pushes ""trash"" into the container though."
4,No Time for Sergeants,It is nice to see an old movie I heard about but have never seen. Funny with Andy being backwoods.
5,no time for sergents,it is a funny movie and can be seen by all audiences.your kids will be rolling on the floor with laughter.
5,"Great movie, needs a DVD release","this is one of my favorite movies, with an all-star (for the time) cast.Don Knotts, even though his part is small, is outstandingi dont know who it was, but the shrink in this movie with andy griffith is also outstanding, that whole scene will have you rolling in your chair. However, this movie really needs a DVD release, with if we were lucky, deleted scenes included, that would be awesome.everything else is out on DVD so whats the holdup?"
5,"100+ years from now, this will still be one of the funniest movies of all time","Calling back to a simpler time and place, even one hundred plus years from now ""No Time For Sergeants"" will still be contemporary enough to be considered one of the truly funniest movies ever made since classic comedy never goes out of style."
5,Funny,"I love this movie. Andy Griffith is wonderful and it is totally hilarious. It is great to see Don Knots in an early role as well, even if it is fairly brief."
5,nothing like classic comedy,good clean comedy for the whole family.... and it's hysterical to boot!this one leaves you laughing till you're in tears!one of the funniest movies ever!
3,Good movie but sound quality was awful,"We love this movie, but were very disappointed when we went to play it as the audio in large sections of the movie was missing."
4,Purchase Review,"The purchase of this DVD went fine-Paypal made sure the owner received his payment and I received the DVD in time to give it as a Christmas gift to my dad. It was in very good condition, and I would recommend this seller anytime."
1,Terrible Quality for a great show,"The quality of this dvd was terrible! On top of which, I must have misread the description... for, I thought I was buying the movie with ""Andy Griffith"" in it! THe movie was a 10! However, although this show was a rare item, and worth watching (for sure)... and I certainly appreciate the time and effort these people went through to create this product (along with the nice case with homeade photo). I don't think it was worth it."
2,Was that Klinger as co-pilot?,"Kind of below my pay rate or intelligence level & I'm no Einstein. The thing is, it's a hot, muggy night, with nothing on the box but pseudo reality shows & poker or soccer on espn. Good ol' TCM comes up with this offering. First it's in need of severe editing. Slow to develop, ponderous humor. Like a bad sit-com from the 50""s. Plot? Andy Griffith & Nick Adams have been drafted... into the Air Force. His gentle aw-shucks hilarity (?) ensues in his first comedy. Andy has two acting speeds. The first was his Lonesome Rhodes speed. He was excellent in that dramatic role in Face in the Crowd. We never saw that again. Then there's the Andy of Mayberry speed which he's been peddling for over 50 years into a very successful career. Some interesting cameos such as Jamie Farr & Don Knotts plus others you may recognize."
2,"Video, ""No Time For Sargeants"", Review","It arrived in a reasonable amount of time. The condition was ok, not great but ok. It did appear as if it came from a video rental company which was a bit troubling. All in all it was an ok experience although I think for the condition a bit overpriced."
2,Disappointed,I thought this was in color now because of the way it is on the cover. I am not a real fan of black and white movies. If this was in color I would have rated it a 5.
5,"Laugh, until you can laugh no more...","What a great classic comedy. Being from the south, I can honestly see some of my neighbors in this film. I think I have most of the lines memorized. Griffith is outstanding, as is Knotts. If you have a comedy collection started, this is a must addition. If you want to start one, this would be a great starting point."
1,wouldn't buy it again,"Is not as good as it is reviewed. Don Knotts is barely in it, and there is cussing all over in it."
5,No Time for Sergeants,I forgot how funny Andy Griffith really was in his earlier days. I laughed until I had tears rolling down my cheeks. Great movie.
1,rip off-rip off- rip off,do not buy this- this is not the MOVIE version of No time for sergeants-this is some stupid play on t.v. that is nothing like the movie and is terrible- what a rip off.
5,Great Stuff,"Really interesting to see Andy, the down home but cool dude sheriff of Mayberry, so early in his career that he is cast as a Gomer Pyle kind of character. Nuff said, watch and enjoy!"
1,Disappointment,I am so disappointed. I was so excited to get this movie that I watched it as soon as it was delivered or at least I tried to. The disc kept cutting off or stalling. I never even made it through the movie because I was so frustrated. I won't buy from this vendor again.
4,No Time for Sergeants,"Great, I have been waiting for this to be on DVD forever. A must add to your collection"
4,"Small, easy to use, good picture quality, fair price!","The compact size and easy interface make this camera desireable. Included is a memory card reader with a USB cable making it even more convenient to use. Those features combined with excellent photo quality (in decent lighting) make it a bargain at... The only short comings are: 1. No physical zoom (unlike the comparable Canon Digital Elph) 2. After pressing the button, the picture isn't taken immediately - meaning if you move the camera immediately after snapping the picture it will be blurry. All in all an excellent buy and I've been very pleased with it. If you're looking for a simple camera with a small size and good picture quality, this is a great choice. I've been very pleased with it!"
4,"Nice, simple origami instruction book suitable for a young child.","This thin vintage paperback, designed by Satoru Tanase and published by Asahi Shiko Co., includes very clear instructions on how to make a variety of origami paper animals. The included shapes are: stork, duck, dog, pig, tortoise, nightingale, monkey, penguin, eagle, rooster and a peacock.The instructions are very visual, with actual instructions on the bottom of each page (the one problem about this book is that they are set from right to left, possibly because the book was printed in Japan).Overall, this book is a very good introduction to origami for a young child or an adult who wishes to try his/her hand at this interesting art form."
3,A better written review of Brennan Seelie's Review,"Thomas Toraz, fourteen year old boy, lives with his grandparents off the coast of Baja California. His grandpa, Ramone, owns the fishing camp that they live in. Thomas is a smart boy and has a chance to become a marine biologist if he stays is school. But he knows his family needs him more at home and could become a shark fisherman to fulfill his family tradition. He is faced with the conflict of whether to earn fast money or go to school and get a good education. He finds out that the officials are making his family pay rent on their own island but they aren't able to pay it and feels he needs to help and make money. His uncle says there is a whale shark in the shallows so he decided to try and catch the shark to pay the rent but messes up everytime. When he finally gets close enough to it, things are not as they appear."
2,The Book wanders from the plot,"I gave this book a 2 star rating because it had an interesting plot, with a good story line and taught a lot about both Mestizo and Mexican culture, but there were many things about this book I did not like. One was Tomas's (the main character) daydreaming. He constantly dreamed about catching a shark and it was interesting at first, but it soon got old. I also didn't like how the book got into such detail about the reef. It gave a lot of information, but distracted me from the plot of the book. The author also didn't tell what happened when Tomas and his friend Griselda got into a fight. What happened? Did they make up? Did Griselda stay mad?-Kahli, KMS"
1,one of the worst books ever written,"This is by far one of THE worst books I have ever read IN MY LIFE. The lead character, Tomas, is played out as a normal Mexican child, yet the author makes it sound like he is an adult. It is set in Baja, Mexico, i'm sure this place is rural and doesnt have a lot of people, but I'm sure they have better things to do then stalk sharks and pretend there are boats on top of mountains. About 85% of this book is about Tomas talking about fishing. Okay, if you are contemplating being a fisherman, GET this book, I'm sure it can help you. For the rest of you, if you buy this book you are just wasting your money."
3,Book has good plot but is unrealistic.,"I gave this book a 3 star rating. The plot was good and the characters were somewhat realistic. I took off some points, because the author had too many little stories revolving in one big story. They distracted me from the real plot in action. Also, Tomas was always daydreaming about catching the shark, but only a few times did he actually get a realistic plan. The story was too predictable, then, the author used too much detail and ran off the story, then finallly she realized belatedly that she wasn't following the plot. Tomas was too overconfident, and wasn't like a real boy. A real boy has more childish things to think about. The bottom line is, the book was definatly not the best that I have ever read. Eva, KMS"
1,Shark Beneath th Reef,"HEY! WELL I HATE THIS BOOK!!! IT IS SOOO RETARDED!!!!!! I WANT SOME CHEAT NOTES SO I CAN FINISH THIS STUPID PACKET!!AHHHHHH!!!!!! WELLLLLLLBYE!!!!laugh out loud!!!!!love,a person!"
1,It's your money,"I personally did not find this album very interesting. I do not see this album as forging new directions or even following old familiar ones. It's just simply, well, rather boring. While I do not deny she has a beautiful voice and it's hard to find such talent among today's offerings, I still find this album boring. Her voice isn't what it once was, and what it is now isn't growing old gracefully. And yes I said boring twice because that's how boring it is. Buy the album if you want, but I wouldn't recommend it at all. I considered giving her more stars just because she's Barbra, but then thought that is just more reason to give one star and show her how truly dissappointed in this album I was."
2,Boring,"I have loved Ms. Streisand's music for many years, but frankly, this album is boring. All the songs sound alike. By the time I got to the end of the CD, I had already decided to put it away. My advice? Unless you are a real die-hard fan, don't waste your money on this one."
2,pretty average,first off the Bat Barbra Streisand is one of the Greatest Artists Ever in my Book.Her Career spans so much&She has tapped upon pretty much every style you can think of.but Albums like this remind how She has also over the past decade cooled way off.She hasn't really tapped into any new Territory Musically&this Set seems to Safe.I Applaud Her Effort but I don't quite get what She was Attempting to do with this Set again.it feels like it was Phoned in.
1,I am a professional music fan and I didn't like this album,"Diehard fans will try to paint me into a picture of hatefull, unrefined, right wing nut; however, I love music-good music. I played classical trumpet and french horn through college and beyond. I am a great fan of music. Yet, I cannot in good conscience recommend this album to anyone. If you like Babs, you probably won't care or let yourself admit that this album is bland boring and lacluster. However, us HONEST people know that this is a half-witted effort by an otherwise refined artist. Politics aside, and I admit I don't like how she is part of the far far far left these days but what does that matter here, this album is subpar. I was dissappointed."
2,Time to Retire- Babs!,"Bab's drones on in a dull and lifeless whisper simply because the voice aint what it used to be.She is, after all,61!Any further releases will simply be the same sort of elevator music you hear on this one.The last track says it all when she attempts to belt out ""Me!"" at the very end and you can hear the deterioration in her voice.If she had any sense, she'd just release Greatest Hits Vol 2,3,4, and any other best of variation you can think of to roll in the bucks."
2,COULD BE MUCH BETTER,"My goodness, Barbra does allright with this I guess, but being that it is Barbra was expecting so much more! I have given her other albums 5 stars, but this one gets only 2."
3,Putting it together,"I am a great fun of the diva. Her voice is making me tremble, but was I expecting too much?! There are song like ""Baghdad Cafe"" where there is no news from Babs, and I'm not thrilled from ""Smile"" or"" Moon river"" either. There is a feeling of just making another album, and withstanding the ""need"" of releasing a piece once a year, at the same place and at the same time. The only really masterpiece of this album is ""wild is the wind"", where I felt again strong vibrations.Babs, you have a wonderfull and unique voice and we are used to your perfectionism. Where the hell it went?!"
