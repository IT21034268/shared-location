2,Amazon needs to work on their buffering.,"Let me begin by saying that there is nothing wrong with this movie. I had to watch it for a class, and my classmates and I rented it off of Amazon. The movie kept buffering every few minutes, so we would let it ""sit and buffer."" Then it would just do it again and we had to wait... again. Finally one of the girls went on Google and searched to ""watch Parenthood the movie for free."" We then watched it with no problems. No buffering. Better quality of picture too."
4,Steve Martin,I bought it for my 13 year old son. Slightly inappropriate for him (mature themes). He is a fan of Steve Martin though.
5,Parenthood,"Arrived in timely manner (sooner than anticipated), in great condition, and made the perfect gift I hoped it would!"
3,"Overpriced, no-frills DVD of a wonderful movie","This is a wonderful, heartwarming film that always manages to make me laugh AND cry....that's why I wanted to own a copy. Unfortunately, the DVD lacks any special features to enhance it (especially frustrating since it's a comparatively expensive one!). How tough would it have been for Ron Howard, Steve Martin or any of the supporting cast to offer a commentary track?That's why I'd recommend it as a rental only. Dianne Wiest and Helen Shaw deliver exceptional performances...Steve Martin's at his most charming...the child actors are superior and it's one of Mary Steenburgen's best performances."
1,"Not in ""Widescreen?""",This is one of my top twenty movies of all time. It isn't in wide screen format? What were they thinking? I'll never buy it unless they release it in widescreen! A Ron Howard masterwork wasted...
3,Took itself way to seriously.,"This movie looked really funny in the trailers...I found, however, that most of the funnier scenes were already shown in the trailers show there wasn't much else to see. All the funny stuff happens within the first 10 or so minutes into this one and after that there are just one or two more laughs scattered here and there. For the most part I found this movie way to serious, and it wasn't entertaining to me. I can see how others can relate to it, but I am a single guy with no kids or girlfriend...so I cannot really relate to it. If you are a parent though it might be worth your while to ignore this review and go ahead and watch the movie."
1,Great Film...,But the DVD is only offered in full screen. Call me when they're offering it in widescreen. Later.
1,"""No widescreen"", ""NO SALE""!!!!!","This is such a good film that ranks in the top five of Steve Martin films, with such a great supporting cast and a truly original and funny screenplay for them to work with, it just seems a shame that we the consumer had to wait more than a decade for a ""Pan-Scan"" DVD release of this great family film, I'm sure alot of people would agree with me that it's like watching 1/2 of the original movie. I hope the distributer of this DVD gets copies of all these reviews and then thinks twice about the next movie he ""butchers"" by releasing it in a ""Pan-Scan"" format on a DVD because he just lost a lot of sales due to the lack of a widescreen version of this DVD and ""I am sad to say I'm one of those lost sales""."
3,"Parenthood funny, but slow","Director: Ron Howard Cast: Steve Martin,Rick Moranis,Mary Steenburgen and Jason Robards. Ron Howards comedy of Steve Martin trying not to be a cut up as a father is good but slow and skeptical.It was okay"
3,"Okay, but to . . . . . . . . sexual.","I thought that this movie had a very good ending, but there were too many revealing scenes (like the son's movies, or when Steve Martin and his wife are in the car). It's sort of funny, and sweet, but to much sex."
4,"Good fun, even more now having kids","This is a fabulous film. Steve Martin is great, but so is the rest of the fantastic cast. There are great laugh out loud moments and the film has a ig heart that makes the movie great to watch over and over."
4,Opie Has Grown Up,"This Ron Howard celebration of family proves once and for all, that ""Opie"" has indeed grown up. As an upper-middle-class father and husband, Steve Martin embodies Thoreau's dictum that ""most men lead lives of quiet desperation."" Martin transcends the flawless ensemble production, without stealing anyone's thunder. Mary Steenburgen, Jason Robards, Dianne Wiest and a lot of other names, familiar and otherwise, are all perfect."
1,Why screw up such a great movie with a pan/scan DVD?,"It is unacceptable, in 2004, to have any film released on DVD without a widescreen version at least on the other side of the disc. Shameful. This is such a great film. But remember, you're only seeing about 2/3rds of it since the studio chopped off the left and right sides for you.Totally unacceptable. Please do not buy this disc. Perhaps that will motive the studio to release the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio so we can actually see the whole thing."
5,I LOVE this movie...,"...from the first time I saw it and every time I've seen it since. You can't go wrong with this movie. It's just good, old family fun!! LOVE IT!!"
2,Not working,I got it in the mail and took it home to watch and it was not working! I worked on it and I am going to try to clean it again. Very upset! If it won't work then it wil have to be returned!
4,Timeless thrills and chills of Parenting,"Great story, great performances and a great time. This is a great movie that still holds together after all these years. There are a few minor scenes that I can do without, but again they are minor and are definitely not show-stoppers; otherwise I would have given it 5 stars. After watching it again on Amazon, I've made it a part of my blu-ray collection."
4,Parenthood,"A wonderful family movie with laughs abound. The cast did an excellent job in imitating America's dysfunctional families.Reeves is funny, but then, I enjoy most of his movies. Steve Martin is once again a ""top"" form. The movie is worth buying simply for its laugh content. I have viewed the movie five times and still enjoy watching it. A future classic for college literary review classes in filmology."
3,Parenthood,"The movie was great. I have seen it before. This was the first time I rented from Amazon, but I had trouble viewing the movie. I watched part of it and then went to watch the rest and kept getting connection issues."
1,Not cool,"I really like this movie, but buying it on DVD is misleading. This movie has not offically come out on DVD so all of these ""DVDs"" are copies and mine dose not work at all in my DVD player!"
1,Ho Hum Idiocy,If pointless humor is your thing then this is the movie for you! Probably the best place for this movie is in a dark box where box where young people could not entertain any wrong ideas.
4,Who couldn't relate?!,"Parenthood is a funny, touching film. I'm not a big Steve Martin fan but he does a wonderful job in this movie, capturing the loving family man who finds himself dealing with issues relating to work and family. Actually, all the actors do a great job in portraying their roles.Even if you are not from a large family you can find something to relate to, since the focus is on the variety of personalities and issues that can come up in anyone's life."
3,Middle of the Road,"This was an okay book. It was fairly enjoyable, except that I kept waiting for the ""real story"" to start. It's fairly obvious that Rilsin is going to have to overthrow her cousin and oust her from the throne -- Sithli is an incompetent ruler -- and I spent almost the entire novel waiting for the rebellion to get started. I suppose we're supposed to be all caught up in Rilsin's struggle with her divided loyalties, but instead all I felt was incredibly frustrated.Still, the author made me care enough that I finished the entire book. There were some extremely compelling moments and ideas, and Ms. Brennan has a gift for creating fascinating, three-dimensional characters. I found the plot boring and relatively uninteresting, however. This book didn't give me that compulsive page-turning, ""I can't wait to see what happens next"" feeling.So I'm giving this book three stars -- its good points and its bad points average out to leave it smack dab in the middle."
4,Whoa! Don't be hatin' -- this book rocks,"Like, dudes, what's happening? Hillary and Elder have told an amazing story in a groovy poetic way. I came away wondering why would Peter Hillary put himself through so much hardship. I learnt a lot of from In The Ghost Country and I really like it a lot."
1,"Trying to make the story do too many things.,",".I personally thought this book was really depressing and simply written. For the sake of all those disappointed souls who will actually buy this book, I just have to say that Amazon has at least 1000 books in this genre that are much, much better.I suggest that this book does not reach expectations of the publisher's comments. I just didn't get into this so called adventure story - ghost story - psychological thriller; perhaps that's the author's problem. Trying to make it too many things at once and only slightly succeeding. I cannot recommend it with so many other greater choices available. I'm always suspect when I see only maximum star ratings in a row?"
3,flow too fast,they don't spill but the flow on these was too fast. (The package was also open which was strange.)
1,Still spill everywhere,"My children like to pour their milk all over toys and into tea cups and everything they can. I was hoping these nipples would stop them from being able to do that. No, they do not work at all. They may not be able to ""shake"" milk out, but they just pinch it and pour milk out all over everything.."
2,:( my baby just didnt like,"we already are using a standard nipple, he could not get anything to come out ultimatly i put on a regular nipple back on so he could eat the tip of this looks like a sippy cup it is cross cut and when compress flows heavey"
2,Not for Newborns,"I have a 2 month old and bought a pack of bottles with these nipples to try because my other bottle set leaks and I cannot transport liquid in them in the diaper bag. Unfortunately my daughter cannot get anything out of the nipple whatsoever. She has no trouble latching on the breast or using Avent nipples. The only reason I am giving 1 star because I can not use them currenly, but I hope to use them in the future when she gets older. If she ever gets a hang of the nipple, I will come back and edit this post."
4,Great Nipple Great Idea...But be careful,These nipples are GREAT! They really are spillproof. My twins had no problem getting milk through them. You no longer have to worry about bottles laying in the crib at night or on the floor or in the car. Nothing comes out until your baby sucks. The only thing I found out the hard way is that you have to be very careful cleaning them with a nipple brush. If you push it in too hard the seal in the nipple hole gives way and you won't know it until you give your baby their next bottle. The milk comes pouring out through the hole. But this is more a mommy flaw than a product flaw. Perhaps a warning should be posted on the packaging.Mommy of twins in Florida
1,Big Disappointment,"I recently bought a 6 pack of these nipples. I thought this would be a great product. I loved the teething nubs, the vari-flo and the non-drip design. I have used these on several different bottles, every type I own, and nothing comes out at all. My baby sucked for 30 minutes and he had not gotten anything! I tried making sure that the hole was open, etc. but no matter what, they do not work. I am very disappointed in this product. I purchased these at a Wal-Mart store, but I did not keep the package, so I cannot return them. This was a big waste of money! I used a lot of Luv N Care products with my other two children. I trusted this name and thought that I would really like these nipples. It is a great product idea, but there is a major problem with this product design. Don't waste your money."
3,"Not a bad product, but I'm glad I kept my Palm V","I purchased this device mainly because I work for a company that does Windows CE development. It's not a bad product, but it will never get Palm owners to throw away their PDAs.It's full featured, but it's just not a quick to access the individual applications. I can sync info just as easily with Office 2000 with my Palm. Maybe if I hadn't used a Palm first I'd fall in love with the Compaq, but I'm spoiled by the quicker response of the Palm (not to mention I've been using a Palm Pilot since day one and Palm graffiti is permanently burned into my brain!)It's also still just a little big larger than the Palm V, which bugs me. Still, the voice recorder is a nice touch that the Palm doesn't have. Everything else is just overkill for me, though."
4,Good...but Compaq is a problem.,"I find this Aero quite a good buy. I got it ...and enjoyed it. After a while something happened to the screen, and after debating with every type of Compaq representative on the phone, they fixed it. This happened again more recently, and I went through the same process.In conclusion, it is a very good unit. But Compaq is not as good."
2,Poor packaging,The DVD was thrown into an envelope and crushed by the US postal service. A little cardboard would have minimized the damage. Not happy with the USPS (it's a given that those monkeys don't care about how the mail is handled) or the seller's choice of packaging.
5,TPB Xmas!!,Great movies if you love TPB. Kinda short but funny! Great stocking stuffer! Merry Xmas!!
5,Too Funny!,My husband and I fell in love with the Trailer Park Boys and the Xmas special did not disappoint. My husband LOVES the Conky finger puppet.
1,Avanti Aspen 6-Piece Emellished Towel Set,"I found the quality and workmanship to be very disappointing. I expected a much finer quality, based on the regular price of the item (+$90.00). I returned the items for a refund as I would not hang these towels in my home."
1,Fantastic 4,"This game is a big disappointment to me, nothing works as it should, the control and movements of the characters is below standard. You do not get to choose the character you want and the buttons to move ahead do not always work. In fact I am still STUCK! in one place because the control they tell you to use keeps giving me a ""did not work, Try again"" message. I may scrap this game if I cannot get it to work, There are no walkthroughs or hints to help. As far as I know there are no repairs to the game as yet."
5,She's..... wondferful!!!,"Reading this book shocked me into remembering how much I'd loved the Saga of the Exiles. This continuation is just as good, if not better. Rogi is a loveable main character, and the viewpoint is magnificent. Julian May weaves sucha full web, you are never left without something to read. THIS is how the future could have been, THIS is how it could still be."
1,rewind,"Well, after reading the other glowing review, I thought I couldn't go wrong here; blistering rock, etc., etc.... well, on opening the CD and seeing the illustration and photograph of who must be Glenn Hughes, I thought ""Oh No""; the dude looks straight out of Las Vegas Arena-Rock; on listening to the music, I thought ""Oh No"";the music is garbage, I had to turn it off. It sounds like a combination of Gary Wright (Dream Weaver anyone?)and Joe Satriani...both of which have virtues in their own rights, but the Voodoo Hill product is just flat out tacky and pompous. Glenn Hughes obviously thinks he is 'The Man' but he has a terrible tendency to sound like a white man mocking a black man making fun of hard rock."
1,Waste of money,We bought that trimmer to replace 5-year-old Norelco model which recently broke down. We thought that Vidal Sasson is a well known brand in hair-care business - we were very wrong.The trimmer came in broken. Didn't want to charge correctly. But even if used with a power cord the quality of cut was far from good. The blades weren't sharp enough and were pulling hair out while cutting. Also hair got stuck underneath the blades and required cleaning after each cut.My old trimmer was far more superior then this new model. I managed to have it fixed and I'm still using it - Vidal Sasson went straight to garbage.
1,failed in the middle of its third haircut,"With a loud ""click"" these clippers just stopped working, and in the middle of the third haircut they'd been used on. Needless to say, this was a false economy purchase, since it cost $25 to get the bad haircut fixed. These clippers are a total piece of junk ... and are now part of a landfill somewhere."
5,great value and does the job,"far better than wahl's adjustable model-- which cuts hair painfully and badly. works well, feels robust."
3,Not bad,"This Hotel Costes volume, ""Quatre"", is faster paced than the others. Most of the selections here are not actually Lounge or Chill, since they are too fast for the genre. This is not music to lounge to...it's music to frantically brush your teeth to because you're late for the lounge. It's not great, but it's quite good and lively (or at least speedy)."
1,Terrible Reproduction,"This is an excellent album that I've enjoyed listening to many times. Unfortunately the dog ate my original disk. When this version arrived, I played it and it sounded like I had ear muffs on. Sound is totally flat and very disappointing. Sounds like a cheap copy. New box style was pretty cheesy as well. Streaming audio from Pandora sounds better, which isn't saying much. Will be returning for sure."
3,Not strong enough....,"Mine has broken twice, left analog stick broken (always forces the movement down). Can't recommend without an insurance policy, the product is just too weak.Update: Another one of these broke on me. The left analog stick gets ""stuck"" in the down position and there is a fine white dust eveident arount the base of the analog stick. I'd say stay away from this one, which is too bad because it is quite responsive and has good battery life. One other thing, the controller will quit responding if too close to a ringing 2.4 GHZ cordless phone."
4,Cordless...,"This controller is great design. The fact that it is cordless is best thing about it. The design is great for playing hours on end, and your hands don't cramp...but the only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the fact that I am on my 3rd one. The first one - the left analog stick quit working after about 10 hours of play. The second controller I got just quit working all together after 2 weeks of play.. The company I got it from (Tech Depot) is awesome, they sent me a prepaid UPS return label each time no hassle and so far the third one I have is doing good. Out of all the cordless controllers out there this one received the best reviews, so I guess like anything there are good and bad products - and maybe that is why I am on my third one now. Is anyone else having (or did anyone have) any problems too? For now I am sticking with this contoller, and crossing my fingers that the one I have now will not break..."
2,Not compatible with Dual-Shock2,"Very hard to use at Analog mode, becasue you cannot two jopysticks. Only D-pad is for Analog mode."
1,gross artificial sweetener taste - little kick,"I did not like this at all. It has that bad artificial sugar taste and aftertaste, almost sickening. I didn't feel much energy either. Bad choice on my part. I would recommend buying one pack first just to try - others here don't seem to mind the sickening fake sweetness. Make sure your water is pretty cold though."
3,Makes H2O a blast!,"Low calories, the benefit of herbs and vitamins, good taste, and caffiene! Great combination. I liked to take it on walks and bike rides. I plan on ordering more. My sons (ages 12 and 9) didn't like it, though. I guess they like their drinks sweeter."
5,Fred and Wilma: Partners In Crime,This is just a fun popcorn movie that you can watch and just zone out. It's a good tranfer from cartoon to live action. John Goodman always plays cool characters with alot of heart. He's really good in Stella as well. I also love Rosie O'Donnels giggle as Betty. It's weird that Elizabeth Taylor is also in this film. You would'nt expect to see her name underneath The Flintstones title. Yabba Dabba Do!!!!!
5,A FEEL GOOD MOVIE!,"I love The Flintstones, in any shape or form that I can see them. I remember wonderful memories of watching them on TV with my children and now with my grandchildren and I was delighted when the movie came out, I was not disappointed!John Goodman is great as Fred,rough around the edges but yetquite loveable! The casting was great, the scenery was great, everything about this movie was just plain fun! That is what it's all about and what it should be about! Fred gets in trouble, Barney bails him out! Simple! Fun! Entertaining!What more do you want?"
2,Simply contrived,"I don't suppose it was made for people my age, but having been brought up with various Hanna-Barberra cartoons in the 60s, I had to at least take a peek at this film which the kids were watching. Now I wish I hadn't, for I can't say anything complimentary about this movie. Maybe if I looked harder, I would admit that some of the characters were sympathetic, but not really. Even good, ol' likeable Barney Rubble let me down. The movie suffered from characters that were totally contrived and never able to lift themselves off the flatness of the comic-book page, which is where they should have stayed.To learn whether this type of movie can ever be successfully made, you can try and find the Claude Berri production of ""Asterix,"" starring Gérard Dépardieu. So far, it doesn't seem to be available in English, and amazon.com doesn't have it at all (May 2000). But there's a movie for you, lifted right off the page. And to think that they've made a second Flintstones movie. Ugh!"
2,Don't be fooled by this .....,"Okay, this was an okay. John Goodman and Elizbeth Perkins are great as Fred and Wilma. The producers couldn't of picked a choice. Rick Moranis was terrific as Barney Rubble. He hasn't lost his comedic touch. Even Hally Berry was good as the seductive, Ms. Rosetta Stone. However, once again Rosie O'Donnell just didn't cut it as Betty Rubble. Her preformance in this film was just not as good, as it could be. Which is a shame, cause this could of been a great film."
5,Flintstones VHS Movie,"Hi, i'm sorry, i thought i had already done this, so i will get right to it.Everything from start to finish with this deal was great, movie, seller,also received it in the mail pretty fast, so i have no complaints what so ever. I appreciate you being so patient in waiting for your feedback, and again i'm sorry.Thank you, Shirley"
3,Yabba Dabba Poo!,"""The Flintstones"" could have been so much better. The cast is perfect including John Goodman, Elizabeth Perkins, Rick Moranis, Rosie O'Donnell, Kyle MacLachlan and Halle Berry. Can it get any betta? Kind of based on the cartoon, a slimy executive wants to humiliate Fred Flintstone. That's basically the story. You really have to watch this movie for the actors. Forget Elizabeth Taylor making a cameo which ruined everybody's lives. People still hate bird poo splattering all over their vehicles. Look at Halle Berry, Fred Flintstone should've been saying 'yabba dabba woo!' But, in most cases, the movie isn't for everybody and it might have people saying it's a big piece of 'yabba dabba poo.'"
2,A couple good actors in a weak production,I've been a Flintstones fan since I was a little kid. (a long time!) So I was dissapointed by this movie. The producers tried too hard to make it the ultimate feel-good movie. The Flintstones overflowed with goofy sentimentality to the point of being sickenly sweet. Halfway through the movie I was ready to vomit pure sugar. I did like the scenery. It reproduces the bright colors and fanciful stone age setting of the cartoon series. John Goodman and Rick Moranis did a good job trying hard to salvage the sappy script they were given. I would have liked to have seen anyone other than Rosie O'donnell in this film. Who told her she could act? One other thing I found strange was Halle Berry with her 1990's buzzcut hairstyle. Her look is definately not the kind of style I would expect to see in a film that is set in the stone age.
3,Prehistoric Halle!,"Halle Berry in prehistoric times...if it were true I'd have loved to have been there. The movie is entertaining for the whole family. It's an amusing movie but the highlight for me was the sexy seductress, miss Sharon Stone...played by the most beatiful women in all of hollywood, Miss Halle Berry. The movie gets 3 stars...Halle gets 5:)"
3,Great movie for Flintstone-fanatics!,"Throughout the entire movie I really enjoyed the scenery. The movie did a grat job of explaining how the ""Flintstonian"" world was, but one thing was missing--PLOT! I can't even count the number of times my mind strayed from the plot and focused on the effects. If you're already a Flintsone fan, you'll most likely recognize reference to the cartoon. If you're not a fan, you'll most likely fall asleep! I even hear a prequal is coming out-(The Flintstones: Viva Rock Vegas)"
2,A Bad Version Of The Flintstones,"The reason I gave this movie two stars was because, it was a waste of time, and nothing good even happened. Still, it's an okay movie. Not that bad for the family. Kids might think it's pretty funny.If there's anything I can tell you, I'd say, ""the choice is yours"". Rent it if you like. It's up to you."
5,Great Movie,I use to watch The Flintstones cartoon every Saturday mornings. I Think they did a great job with this movie. It looks so real. I enjoy the story in this movie. This is a must see movie for all family's.
2,Anything with Rosie is doomed,Every guy's cartoon fantasy in Betty Rubble went up in flames and crashed into the ground after this was released. Couldn't they have found Uma Thurman or Anna Nicole Smith?
1,Apalling!,"This pathetic, no-brains-required movie was enough to warrant me, (The most tolerant of viewers) to leave the theater midway through this travesty! I would almost gladly sever my friendship with a colleague who was ""kind"" enough to escort me back to my seat! Grrrrr.... what did I ever do to you?!"
1,Yabba-Dabba-Doo-Doo!,"One would think that after ""Popeye"", Hollywood would have stopped trying to adapt cartoons to live action features, but apparently someone didn't get the word in time. If nothing else, this film proves beyond all doubt that ""Popeye"" wasn't as bad as it gets. It is no great shock to see Rick Moranis and Rosie O'Donnell in this film, as both have proven time and again that they will take on any available role, no matter how awful, for a buck, but it is particularly sad to see a talented actor like John Goodman mixed up in something this bad. It is boring, pointless, and a complete waste of time. Stick to the cartoons, and avoid this mess."
1,The dialogue of the moive makers shown abowe:,"""Yo, Brian, why don't we make some money with some old cartoon classic""? ""Sure thing, Dude, which piece should we pick?"" ""Why don't we take The Flintstones, it shouldn't be too hard!"" ""Great idea! But wait, the effects are easy to make, but the plot, oh the plot, it's damn hard to create!"" ""Oh c'mon, screw the plot, the kids will buy it off! "" ""Right on! We're going for the money!"" ""All the way! """
1,"If Satan made a movie, this is it.","Law of film #1; never, ever under any circumstances assume that an annoying cartoon will do good as a live-action movie. John Goodman, who is a talented and funny actor, should have realized that."
4,THE BEST cartoon-to-movie remake,"yes, i know that the storyline wasn't very remarkable, but what this movie tried to do was to show us the real-life Flintstones and the real-life city of Bedrock, and i think that they succeeded in that. All the actors look like the cartoons(except for Rosie O'Donnell), especially John Goodman as Fred. Also, Bedrock looks just like in the cartoon, like does Fred's car and the Flintstones' home. If you've always watched the cartoon TV series, i'm sure you'll love this film. This movie gets an 8."
1,not in same league as Bees,"The Secret Life of Bees was an enchanting, beautiful story filled with clever turns of phrase. The Mermaid Chair is a Harlequin romance with improved grammer. Very disappointing, indeed."
1,A Miserable Reading Experience,Are we sure that Sue Monk Kidd wrote this? Who cares about yet another horrid middle-age mid-life crisis tale -- but lets not forget that this one involves a monk -- ohhh -- he's not really a monk yet. Give us a break...
3,Strange book,"*SPOILER ALERT* This book was strange and not necessarily in a good way... I really enjoyed The Secret Life of Bees, but this book was not a good follow-up. It was certainly well-written with beautiful imagery, but the plot and there characters were not great. The protagonist's self-destructive mother was a little over the top and even after discovering what led to her behavior it was not quite believable for someone who wasn't severely mentally ill. As for the protagonist herself, neither her nor her behavior was likable. I just never quite understood what it was about her life that led her to act in the way that she did and why she needed to have a sexual affair with a MONK in order to determine that she needed to be more independent and that she loved her husband. Save your money and your time - painful to get through until the end which was not terrible riveting and predicable in ways."
2,Not that great,"I was very disappointed in this book. Kidd is such a wonderful writer, but this felt like a quicky attempt to get another book out, regardless of quality, to follow-up on the success of Secret Life of Bees...while there was still a buzz, a momentum, to get sales o this off the ground for this wet-dream sophmoric effort. Well written, but more of a romance/pulp piece than a good read. I wouldn't call it literature, wouldn't call it chick-lit, maybe Harlequin Romance kind of thing, but I've neve read one of those to know. I would not recommend it."
2,At least everyone was nice to the dog,"When this book wasn't being an overly-dramatic soap-opera, it was a pretty good travelogue. I found it very difficult to believe that while Jessie's mother was mutilating herself, Jessie was out rolling around in the mud, getting into a holy man's pants. That must have been some aphrodesiac! I'm sorry I paid for the hard-cover edition, too."
3,Enjoyable and thoughtful,"I bought this book because I read The Secret Life of Bees and thought the use of language in Bees was extraordinary, by a fresh and original new literary voice. I know a wonderful first book can be a hard act to follow, especially if the first is so delightful; and this is the case here. Mermaid lacks the originality and poetry of Bees. As a well structured and thoughtful book in its own right, it is competently, even well, written; although I did take issue with some of the psychology behind it. I was also interested in the fact that in both Bees and Mermaid the central character somehow feels to blame for the death of a parent and it is the resolution of this that brings both books to a conclusion."
2,Disappointing,"I had high hopes for this book as I enjoyed the Secret Life of Bees so much. However, I ended up very disppointed. I finished the book, but wanted it to end quickly. I think what I disliked most was the main character, Jessie. For me, she is believable at first with regard to her history, her mother and issues with her husband. The whole whirlwind, selfish, infatuation with a monk, whom she met briefly 1 or 2 times and immediately fell IN LOVE with was too unbelievable to me. The fact that he's a monk doesn't come much into play for her, which is also somewhat bogus for me. Although I'm probably in the minority, I think that the book could have been written and made interesting w/o the whole affair w/the monk. The issues with her father's death and her mother were the real interesting part for me, the rest unbelievable. Disappointing ending."
2,"unfortunately, a waste of time","I had high hopes for this book, having loved The Secret Life of Bees. But I found this book contrived and fairly forced. The author seemed to gather what she thought would be interesting ideas (a monk, a mermaid chair, the Gullah culture), and then wrote about them unconvincingly. I was left with the impression of catchy ideas patchworked together, rather than insights upwelling from her experience. I suppose the self-absorption of her main characters was a disappointment as well."
2,Uninteresting,"I loved Kidd's first book ""The Secret Life of Bees"" and was disappointed with this next work. I plodded through the first two-thirds and then finally felt compelled to keep reading and see what happened in the end. I found I couldn't relate to any of the characters and I didn't like the protagonist, finding her self-indulgent, immature, and weak for most of the book. The bigger message of finding yourself came through more at the end but having that theme more prominent throughout the novel would have made it more easy to read."
3,"Not ""bees""","I read The Secret Life of bees only two years ago, and enjoyed it immensely. The Mermaid Chair falls short of Kidd's debut book, lacking in the depth that made Bees so memorable. The Mermaid Chair tends to be a one note read, an unhappy housewife figures herself out. That's it, we don't have a host of memorable characters or even one main one. That being said, this book does have some interesting moments and the fictional location is intriguing in a way the people aren't. Kidd is capable of better, and I hope we see that in her future work."
2,Underdeveloped and contrived,"I was so looking forward to another book by SUe Monk Kidd, just loved the Secret Life of Bees. But this is totally unbelievable. A soap opera heroine would not fall ""in love"" so swiftly and without reason. Lust is OK, but don't expect the reader to buy into such underdeveloped passion. There is absolutely no longing FOR these characters either and the journey to the truth that is pursued by the daughter thru the mother is not believable."
1,Such a disappointment!,"Kidd's previous novel, The Secret Life of Bees, was one of the best pieces of fiction I've ever read. So I eagerly anticipated her next work. The Mermaid Chair was so disappointing. It is very, very contrived. The main character, Jessie, confuses love and lust and never does seem to figure that out. There is no character who is very real or very appealing. All in all, a downright disappointment."
2,As sappy as the cover suggests,"After agreeing to read The Mermaid Chair with a friend, I tried to avoid the telltale signs that this book would read like a shallow self-help-book-meets-romance-novel. A shiny golden cover illustrated with pink seashells was the first tip-off, followed shortly by reading in the newspaper that the story had turned into a Lifetime original movie. Pass the bon-bons!Throughout the novel, I kept wincing at Kidd's word choice (or lack thereof). Everything was slide, slid, sliding (especially the monks hands on Jessie's body.) I was surprised that the author of a book I really liked (Bees, of course) could write so poorly.The one redeeming feature of this book is Kidd's description of the natural beauty of the island. It is here, and only here, where she shows any talent at her craft. You can tell that Kidd is intimately acquainted with (and deeply fond of) the setting of her story. I felt like I was there. The rest, I'm sad to say, was sorely disappointing."
1,Don't Bother,"What a disappointing follow up to her wonderful novel Secret Life of Bees. I don't know what any man would see in Jessie - a selfish, self-centered dull dishrag of a woman - not to mention a monk, who seems to instantly fall in love with this bland character. The occasional chapter written in third person is a cop out, the ""climax"" could not be any more anti-climactic, and the ending is another cop out. Kidd might as well had Jessie dream the whole thing. The supporting characters are the typical stereotypes - Crazy Mother, her Wacky Best Friend with ""special daughter,"" and Unique Mysterious African American Woman."
3,Not What I expected,"If you are looking for another bee's then this is not it. Even though the story line was not terrible it was not anything that was great either. I have to admit I was a little dissapointed at the outcome. I was also surprised that it made it to the best seller list. I could see a book like Whispers of the Wicked saints on the best seller list or The glass castle. I just think we have it a little backwards this time. To wrap this up I think Sue monk is still an excelent writer and she has not lost me as a fan, she just has a bad book out."
4,Light read enjoyed. Stop comparing to her other book,"Enjoyed, quick read. Why compare to Secret Life of Bees, it's not. I enjoyed, fast light read. This book sat on my shelf for years and after reading all the negative reviews because everyone compared to Secret Life of Bees I was hesitant to read it. It was an easy read, I enjoyed and was not disappointed."
1,Don't bother,"I never read The Secret Life of Bees, but I did hear that it is an amazing book. After hearing and reading all of the reviews, I assumed that The Mermaid Chair, written by the same author, would be equally as good. Well, we all know what happens when you assume.The book is boring. I find myself reading it just to get it over with because I hate starting books and not finishing them. But I may make an exception for this one. The characters are dull, the plot is predictable and unmoving. Luckily I bought it on the bargain rack, and I can see why it was there. Don't bother."
3,Ho Hum,"I was so excited to read this book. The Secret Life of Bees is one of my favorite books and I hoped this would be just as enthralling. It wasn't. The lead character, wants us to believe she is an overworked, underappreciated daughter/wife/mother, but she comes across as self centered and sad. The only part of the storyline I liked at all was the subplot between her and her father - his story is very sad. Sue Monk Kidd has such a wonderful way with words, but they didn't come together as well in this book as in Bees."
2,Not bad but.....,"I was a bit disappointed in this book and while it was not bad, it is not something that I would recommend. I felt it moved rather slowly and really only caught my interest towards the end."
2,Wouldn't recommend,Pages were dogeared and cover was damaged. This was supposed to be in excellent condition but was not. It also took almost 2 weeks to get here. Pages had dirt on some and stickers covered writing in book. Not the same experience I have had with other used books from other parties.
1,No good,"This book was definitely not as good as Secret Life of Bees. Maybe it was because I just couldn't relate to the main character at all. Plus the side story about her mother was just plain wierd. In my opinion, don't waste your time."
5,The Mermaid Chair was marvelous,"I am no great critic, I'm just a 33 year old mom who loves to read when I get the chance and this book was awesome. I loved every moment of it. Sue Monk Kidd is an exceptional writer. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, I escaped into the characters lives with no problem, I hated when I finished it. This and The Secret Life of Bee's are great books I'd highly recommend to anyone who wants to read a great book!"
5,Excellent Read,"The Mermaid Chair by Sue Monk Kidd is an excellent read. It holds your interest so that you cannot wait and see what happens next.It is fiction, but there are several parts that certainly play out in real life such as women in a marriage crisis after their children are gone, empty nest; what is left of marriage when the two are left alone to communicate. It also lets you see how foolish it is for women to have affairs for fulfillment - much better to work through the tough parts of marriage.Highly recommend."
3,Fun to read,"but not nearly as good as The Secret Life of Bees. I enjoyed the relationships in this book, the author is very descriptive, making it easy to get a mental picture. I love her style of writing, this book just isn't as spellbinding... It is an easy read, not too deep."
3,Wouldn't wanted to have missed it.,I read the secret life of bees first and had to have more Sue Monk Kidd. This was an enjoyable book that was easy to read but captured your attention enough to stick with it. Any woman who has had children can identify with the theme of unrealized dreams and ambitions. I thought that the author did a good job of putting you in another world as she did in the secret life.
1,definitely not a page turner. I fell asleep reading it,I couldn't stand this book. I gave it a fair chance but after midway through I put it back on the bookshelf.Very disapointing!
1,The Mermaid Chair,"This is one of the worse books I have ever read. Its a major disappointment since I read and loved ""The Secret Life of Bees"". It consist of a well worn plot; Bored housewife/artist goes back to her old home town when her mother needs help. During her stay, she decides she needs to rediscover herself. She meets a monk who is living in the monastary near her mother's home. He is also trying to rediscover himself. They become involved. These characters are not likable. Neither of them have any real issues to resolve. This much ado about nothing is the basis of their short-lived affair. The health problems of Jesse's mother, Nell, (the reason Jesse came home) quickly becomes a sub-plot."
5,Maybe I'm in the minority...,"But I loved this book. It's oddly realistic despite having some rather ""mysterious"" elements. It's bittersweet, which I tend to love. I almost like it more than ""The Secret Life of Bees,"" though I can see why people who loved it hated this book."
1,Self-indulgent claptrap,"The Ya-Ya Sisterhood, The Thorn Birds and Narcissus and Goldmund, all in one handy volume, with shades of Pat Conroy's settings. And none of the power of any of those works. I am sorry I wasted my time and money."
1,You must be 'kidding',"Shame on Kidd for writing this book and shame on me for buying it.She certainly didn't have a fire in her belly for this book as she had for Secret Life; the tiredness and lack of originality show that. The Mermaid Chair is a Pat Conroy or Ann Rivers Siddons look alike. Me thinks the publisher wanted to get some more big bucks riding on the coattials of the success of Bees.And - in the first 2 sentences, Kidd hooked me, but by the second paragraph I knew exactly what was coming. Just as Kidd has turned her back on her conservative upbringing and writing good articles for Guideposts, she is now selling her gifts cheaply--which means she's selling her soul. Sad, sad."
1,Disappointing and predictable,"While I liked ""The Secret Life of Bees,"" I was not wowed by it like other readers. I felt that Sue Monk Kidd was a very good writer with a keen eye for description, but less successful at creating an emotional plot that rang true and poignant - not overly sentimental.I borrowed ""The Mermaid Chair"" from a friend, and am glad I did not buy it myself. This book is even more hopelessly sentimental than Sue Monk Kidd's first effort. Kidd's tendency to romanticize the confusion and heartache of a woman searching for her identity is tedious at best, maddening at worst. While the book is filled with beautiful, lush descriptions of island life and the stark beauty of faith and yearning, her ""romance genre"" conventions and predictable stock characters (such as the ""colorful native"" Hepzibah) bog down the plot and make ""The Mermaid Chair"" a superficial and unsatisfying read."
1,Feel diminished after reading this book,"Received the book for Christmas. Should have read these reviews and then regifted it. Instead I wasted hours of my life that I will never get back. As an insipid harlequin romance it's bad enough, but the shallow, ignorant, cavalier way the author presumes to depict matters of faith repelled me. And I'm an ATHEIST. I can only imagine what a CATHOLIC would feel about monks assisting in mercy killings and committing adultery with the winking ""disapproval"" of the other monks. WTF?!?! And as a 41yo woman in a committed marriage who is mature enough to realize that struggling with boredom and disillusionment is part of the growth process and should be embraced, I squirmed in embarrassment at Jessie's immature, impulsive, selfish, completely vacuous manner of dealing with those same issues. Come on! This book feels like it was written by a 20yo trying to imagine what life will be like at 40."
1,i was tricked!,"Wow, I read Secret Life of Bees where the author's special knack shines through, every single inch of the way. Then I spy this pretty book with it's pretty title on the library shelf by the same author and my heart goes pitty-pat, because I KNOW I'm in for a spoon-fed treat. But alas, as I turn the pages I not-too-slowly wake up to the dreary reality: I am wasting the space in my brain with every word I take in. It is all hogwash and has already been very accurately described as such by many of these other reviewers here. I will just add this: if you are a glutton for punishment, then see for yourself."
1,A disappointing second act,"I loved this author's first book, but this one was extremely poor.Like THE SECRET LIFE OF BEES, this book deals with running away. However, unlike her first work Ms. Kidd leaves readers shaking their heads. There is no good reason explained as to why this woman up and leaves her husband. The fact that she has an affair with a monk immediately after is that much more confusing and distasteful. Add in the author's liberty in mixing faith and folklore and it all combines into one big waste of time.Read something else. Anything."
1,WASTE OF MY TIME,"I have to agree with the reviewers who are greatly disappointed in Sue Monk Kidd for giving us such a trashy read! Yes, it is a poor version of The Ya Ya Sisterhood. No depth of character (although the characters who were introduced could have had some depth), sleazy affair with a monk that is just totally stupid, main character is not likeable, introduction of unrelated images and ideas that lead nowhere, just thrown together. Because we loved the Secret Life of Bees, our book club selected this for one of our monthly reads. Wish we had not and that we had saved our money for something more substantial and interesting. Save your time and money."
2,Not Remarkable,"Throughout the course of this book, I felt I kept waiting for something to happen. If you read the summary, you pretty much have it there. I found the story to be predictable; a short story lengthened into a novel by adding superfluous descriptions.I also had a problem with the mermaid subtext. It would take A LOT more convincing for me to believe that there was actually a monastery that would process back and forth from the ocean with a ""mermaid chair,"" sprinkling it with seawater in some sort of mystical ceremony.I found Kidd's writing trite, as if she tried too hard to create a spirtual setting. Her descriptions are, frankly, not very creative, and her characters, stereotyped. I was disappointed, like most, who enjoyed The Secret Life of Bees.It's a quick read, but still time better spent reading something else."
1,Very disappointing,"I bought this book with such high hopes. By the time I forced myself to finish it, I was so disappointed. I had heard such wonderful things about The Secret Life of Bees. The ""love"" (I use that term very loosely) story was so poorly written and conceived -- very unbelievable and almost smarmy. I didn't like -- and therefore didn't care about -- the characters. I thought the overall story was a stretch. Sorry -- this one should be passed by. I can't believe it's been so highly acclaimed."
2,What a shame,"Having loved the Secret Life of Bees, I bought this novel without hesitation, and was extremely disappointed. The story itself had promise, but the prose was overwritten, full of cliches, and totally devoid of the subtle, finely-wrought language and characters that made her previous novel such a joy to read. I can't help but think that this one was turned in half-baked."
1,Boring Book - Not a Page Turner,"I loved the Secret Life of Bees. It was a real page turner. Therefore, regardless of the story, I expected an interesting plot, with believable characters, and a lot of conflict. These things it is not. I find myself reading many of the paragraphs over and over again because it does not flow smoothly and is not holding my interest at all. I just can not get in to it. i read 2 or 3 novels a week and most of the time they hold my interest. I thought one of Sue Monk Kidd's novels certainly would. I am so disappointed and sorry that I purchased this book."
2,Ring-a-ling,"Dear Sue Monk Kidd, I have enjoyed your books, from ""Dance of a Dissident Daughter"" to ""Secret Lives of Bees"" and ""When The Heart Waits"" -- which is one of the best books I've ever read.But ""The Mermaid Chair""? Phoned in. Honest. I was disappointed and did not find much in the book to recommend it. Even the descriptions of Gullah culture and island life -- eh. Not enough.Sue, next time, write from the heart without an eye to sales or deadlines. That's what makes your earlier works so wonderful.Sincerely,A Fan"
2,Not as good as her first...,"I really enjoyed The Secret Life of Bees and was hoping to like this one as well. This book left me WAAAAY wishing I hadn't read it.Let's just start by saying the main character, Jessie, is a middle aged woman. I just can't bring myself to think of the name Jessie as that belonging to a middle aged woman. Perhaps that's just me? But Jessie has the perfect life... a gorgeous house, great daughter, handsome, caring husband. And yet she finds that she has lost ""herself""? It just doesn't seem plausible to me.So she has a crazy mother, who is barely described and you just can't even come up with a mental picture of her. There's a slight backstory about Jessie's issues with her fathers death but only the surface is really touched upon and it doesn't give our heroine the backstory the book needs.This one just really fell short for me. I won't go into huge detail cause I don't want to spoil it if you are wanting this book. But for me it fell dramatically short of my expectations."
1,way too much flowery metaphor and retrospection,"I couldn't finish this book. The subject of a middle-aged woman running from her completely normal life and having an affair with a monk is a ridiculous notion to support. The book is poorly written with one long, boring, flowery metaphor after another. The main character waxes philosophic over every minute of her past and is just wretched with wanting what she can't or shouldn't have.This book reminds me of the stories that my juvenile mind in 7th grade creative writing class came up with!"
3,Blaa,"This book was Ok at best. The writing was smooth enough but I did not find myself rooting for the main character. Although I identified with her on some level as a woman and mother, she was a little too whiney and self-centered.""Oh, I lost my sense of self and it's all my way too normal husband's fault. I must console myself with this random Monk Hunk I found on an island."" A monk? Whatever."
2,A Little Disappointed,"It really was not as good as ""The Secret Life of Bees"" which I read and loved. The characters in ""The Mermaid Chair"" were more difficult to sympathize with and the story was not as captivating."
3,ok,"This book was just okay for me. After really enjoying Bees so much I really looked forward to this book, but it was just okay.If you read Bees you will probably still want to read this one, but don't have high expectations. Just ok"
3,Decent Summer Read,"I haven't read Secret Life of Bees so I don't know what this writer is capable of. However, I thought Mermaid Chair was an interesting book but fell short in some of the themes SMK was trying to explore. Maybe too much was going on...there was the mother-daughter issues, the midlife crisis issues, the forbidden love issues, etc. I also agree with previous posts that the book ended too neatly, as though the writer were rushing to tie up loose ends. Her marital problems seemed too lightweight to propel her into an affair. The mother-daugher relationship was the most believable and appealing for me."
2,"Problematic, unsatisfying story","This novel has a few redeeming themes, settings, and characters, but overall, it's choppy, forced, problematic. In order to be believable, there would have to be about 3 or 4 times the plot development and detail. Seems to be attempting to follow the same formula as ""The Secret Life of Bees"" but is far less successful."
2,Boring and slow,"I listened to this book on audio, and really didn't care for it. The story seemed to plod along at a slow pace, with predictable outcomes."
2,Don't sit in any chair for this one!,"I agree 100% with Heatherina above.This was an insipid novel, not nearly as rewarding as ""Bees"" was. The attraction between the two main characters is unexplained and flat, and who cares about them anyway? The mother with psychiatric problems isanalyzed in an amateurish way. The book was entirely predictable. The mermaid theme is strained and artificial feeling, a layer that adds no nuance except to fill pages. This might have made a good short story, that's the best I can say for it. This reminded me of The Time Traveler's Wife, a book similarly awful."
2,A Big Disappointment,"'The Secret Life of Bees' is my favourite book. As such, I was very excited to purchase and read 'The Mermaid Chair'. I just finished it, and I was very disappointed. Although the end does have some redeeming features, I felt the rest of the book read more like a Harlequin romance -- something I don't read! I found the story and writing too deliberate and forced. Without giving too much away, I also thought the explanation of Nelle's behaviour and the description of incidents surrounding Jesse's dad to be very weak. The end or 'resolution' wrapped up far too quickly, and too easily. At least save your money and wait for the paperback. Or, get it from the library, if at all."
2,"Beautiful Setting, Dismal Plot and Characterization","The best thing I can say about Kidd's newest fiction is the evocative island setting with its flora and fauna; I could envision the egrets and feel the salt wind blowing on my face. However, the plot was weak and I developed no empathy for the underdeveloped characters. It played like a poorly written made-for-TV movie."
3,Not what I thought it would be,"This book started really slow, and was just barely interesting enough to keep me going. Not sure how I felt about the whole thing with on the side fun, then not being happy with her decision at the end. Left me feeling dull."
2,"Contrived imagery, but a great setting","The Mermaid's Chair didn't draw me in. The plot was rather standard with bizzare elements like a compulsion to chop one's finger off guilt for a drammatic death sort of tacked on. I was eager to read about the area where this was set, but everthing felt so contrived that I couldn't really buy the story or the characters. The affair with the monk seemed unlikely piled upon contrived. I was not a huge fan of The Secret Lives of Bees either, but it was better than this."
3,The; Mermaid Chair,"I am afraid it was something I could have done without, although others I know have enjoyed it."
2,Don't waste your time,"I read this book because I had couldn't get ""The Secret Life of Bees"" and thought perhaps this book would be just as good. I have yet to read the ""The Secret Life of Bees"" but this book is nothing to rave about. I felt the plot was weak and too much time was spent on description of location of the story. It was just a poor attempt to tell a story about mid life crisis/empty nest syndrome. I usually don't write reviews but I was taking a flight and a passenger was reading this book and I had a sudden urge to tell this stranger that your wasting your time!"
2,I didn't like it,"I thought this book was very well written, but it's a shame that she chose to write about something you could see daily on the Lifetime Movie Network. Fitting, then, that the movie adaptation will be on Lifetime."
1,"Loved life of Bees, but this is Daniel Steel :-(","I really loved The Secret Life of Bees, and really looked forward to this novel. I had a hard time finishing this book, I kept thinking, ""it has to get better"" but it never did. With lines directly from any one of those books with the half naked women on the front the story is just pathetic. Don't waste your money unless you love Daniel Steel style novels (she was beautiful but didn't know it, he was a monk in training with eyes like denim). Such a HUGE disappointment."
1,This book is boob-club spam. Beware!,"""The secret Life of Bees"" was such a great little novel!I think this is why we decided to give Monk another chance.Perhaps Monk figured that book clubbers (females around 40) would fall for a cheap mid life crisis love story. The plot revolves around a bored middle class wife whose only daughter just went to college (too much time in her hands perhaps?) and a catholic monk in heat (I am afraid that's all he is, Sue).All this is mixed (not very credibly) with a self mutillating mother and an euthanasia story thap pops at the end of the book out of nowhere and that could have easily made enough material for a whole new different novel (a better one I reckon.)Aaaah! so many good books out there and so little time to waste on this one!"
2,A disappointing follow up to Bees,"I loved The Secret Life of Bees. I had high hopes for this novel as a result, but it was a disappointment.The characters were uncompelling. The only ones I found remotely interesting were a couple of the monks, and they were used peripherally and in bizarre ways to move the plot along.Although I had to force myself to plough through the story, the plot marched along at such a quick pace that events were happening in a way that seemed forced and unreal.The author doesn't seem to know if she wanted to write a story about female friendship, forbidden love, guilt and madness, or mid-aged crisis/renewal. The fact that she attempts all at once just makes for a really weak, unsatisfying story.Finally, the imagery in the novel seemed too obvious and not nearly as lyrical and beautiful as in her previous story."
1,A rush to publish on the shirt-tail of Secret Life of Bees???,"I bought this book just because I loved Monk Kidd's SECRET LIFE OF BEES, a beautifully crafted book, and knew this was an author I wanted to follow. What a letdown! I was rolling my eyes as I read thinking, oh please! The plot, unlike SECRET, is paper thin, poorly developed, thus, barely believable. While I can relate to Jessie's midlife crisis, nothing that actually happened is credible or understandable. The shifts to the mind of the monk and later the husband were a disjointing and rather ineffective technique--nothing was accomplished and I ended up understanding none of the characters. I cannot believe the editors actually let this book go to print as is, and I cannot believe Monk Kidd would stoop to publishing a harlequin romance."
3,Hoped for so much More!,"While I loved the imagery in this book, the plot wasrather far-fetched. Really...love at first sight between amiddle-aged married woman and a monk? The monk confessing thislove immediately to his superior? Odd but true. This book isnot a keeper for me."
3,Like a Harlequin novel only better written.,"I think my title said it all. It was entertaining but not meaningful. I feel like it could have been great but nothing was fully developed. If you're interested in giving it a try, save some money and check it out from the library."
2,Very disappointing,"I had high expectations after reading THE BEE SEASON, but found this book to be a very ordinary romantic novel with little depth. Okay for beach reading but am surprised it's a best seller. Found the characters quirky but not that interesting. I lmost quit half way but since it is so popular, I hung in. The mysteries within the book -- for example about why the mother mutilated herself -- took forever to be answered."
3,A Rather Small Splash,"Although this book is a pleasant ""beach read"", I found it difficult to maintain my usually willing suspension of disbelief. Love at first sight (literally) between a middle-aged married woman and a monk? The monk confessing said love immediately to his superior? Come on! Even fiction needs to have some semblance of reality. It's also hard to invest in the concept of the finger-chopping mama, and her reasons for behaving as she does. And that old ""sisterhood"" of women friends dancing with wild abandon on the beach has become a cliche. That said, Kidd's writing, particularly of the Carolina coast, is beautifully descriptive and, in my view, what makes the book worth borrowing from the library."
2,disappointing,"SPOILER ALERT***After just loving ""the Scret Life of Bees"", I eagerly awaited this book. I was disappointed at the shallow re-working of similar plot elements. Most upsetting--the main character thinks s/he is responsible for a parent's death, later to find out that's not so. Sue Ellen, you are such a good writer, why did you resort to this??"
2,Resting on her laurels,"I can't believe this book made the Best Seller List.I know it was only because of the writer's name and the wonderful ""Life of Bees"" she wrote. Romantical clap trap. Disliked Jesse from the beginning -wonderful husband and daughter -her plight was like the hippies in the 60's . ""I need to find myself."" It was readable but predictable . Ms. Kidd, I know you are capable of better than this"
1,Disappointed,The Secret Life of Bees was one of my all time favorite novels. I was terribly disappointed with the Mermaid Chair. It was a mid life crises love story that just didn't interest me. I really hope Sue Monk Kidd can give us another book like her original.
1,are you kidding me???,"I remember reading The Secret Life of Bees and really enjoying the story, the characters and how well written the book was. Then, I waited and waited for Sue Monk Kidd to write another book. Did she really write this book? It's really not good. The mom is cutting her fingers off while her daughter is having an affair in the woods with a monk...What the??? I'm so disappointed. It was a painful read. I hope Sue can redeem herself with her next book. Yikes!"
1,if you crave disappointment...,"...waste some time reading this book. I loved The Secret Life of Bees for its creativity and writing. In stark contrast, Kidd's newest book is a big 'ole turd. Don't bother wasting your time."
2,Almost Satisfactory,"I wanted to like the main character Jessie, but she became so tiresome and all I wanted to do was get through the story in hopes that something would happen. It plods along with the reader being told to believe that a woman goes to takes care of her ""sick"" mother but all she does for her is bandage her a few times a day and doesn't get the woman help until it's almost too late. The mom is going insane! An idiot could see that! Jessie is a psychiatrist's wife for goodness sake, so she has no excuse. The reason for the ignoring of her mother I think is simple though....she's much too busy having an instant affair with a wannabe monk. I can't feel happy for an adulterer and her accomplice. The other characters are cliche, silly and boring but we're supposed to like them because they have a secret. I must admit the secret at the end is why I rated the book as a 2 and also the husband Hugh was the only character I actually liked."
1,"So sad that Women can't seem to ""live"" without men in this novel!!!","There was such promise, a woman who had ""escaped"" her ho-hum marriage, gone back to her roots was finding herself, starting her art work back up, caring for her mysteriously crazy mother, and then she ""had"" to fall for a monk, and turned this story into a romance novel. When she ""married"" herself with knots into the sea, and lovingly talked about mermaids, it had some hope of independence, then it failed, going back to her husband after the ""affair"" (she got dumped for God.) She didn't go back stronger, she went back wimpier and needy. Sure, she had art in a gallery, but whee....where was her growth?? There wasn't any. Sorry. This novel leaves the reader disappointed and sad. Ugh!!"
2,So disappointing after The Secret Life of Bees!,"I was looking forward to this so much after being so completely taken in by Kidd's Secret Life of Bees. This was so bland, and while the descriptive writing was lovely, the story was just blah. I never got interested in the characters, never cared about their motivations, was vaguely disgusted by Jessie's actions. In general, this book was just as plain as plain could be. I hope Kidd has another book like The Secret Life of Bees in her mind somewhere - this was not even close."
2,Disappointing,"Take a bucket of the Ya Ya Sisterhood, a dash of The Thorn Birds, a soupcon of The Prince of Tides, and waaaay too much sugar and you have Sue Monk Kidd's latest novel ""The Mermaid Chair"".It's a lovely love story if you're 15. But if you are an adult and want a meaty tale of the low country, love, lust and weird family dynamics, I recommend going directly to ""The Prince of Tides"" and reading some real literature."
2,Not as good as Secret Life of Bees,"Okay, her mother keeps cutting off her fingers (one by one, no less, and almost bleeding to death because they lived on an island), but she is distracted as to why because she's so busy fooling around with this monk that lives in the monastery next to her mother's home. Come on. No one can be that single-minded, did she not even care about her mother at all?? I was very disappointed with this book--it drags on too long and you really don't care about any of the characters."
2,Falling stars?,"I am not exactly a huge fan of Sue M. Kidd--although I found SECRET LIFE OF BEES endearing,and although a bit silly, far better and more believable than this. Perhaps, the author was pressured to pull another rabbit out of the hat? And often, good books just can't be slapped together the way this one seems to have been written. Flat characters and unrealistic scenarios will bring about an implausable story.I would suggest: re-read or just read (if you haven't already) THE RED TENT ."
1,Do not read.,"I am looking over the other reviews and I'm amazed that anyone has enjoyed this book. It is shallow, the characters are ABSURD (except for the husband, Hugh...he was the only reason I wanted to keep reading!). I am 22 and this book was written for a much older audience (or at least an audience who has been married, etc etc) but I thought it was dull, unrealistic, and very far fetched. To me, the best part about books is taking something relatively normal and writing a story about it--that way, readers can relate. To me, there was nothing relatable about this book and it was lame....I haven't read her first, so I will just to be fair although I am not excited about it."
1,Very disappointing,"I had high expectations after reading The Secret Life of Bees, but this book disappointed the reader about half way through the novel. The plot was pandering to women, unrealistic and unbelievable. Beautiful descriptions of the island were the only redeeming feature. Otherwise it consists of poor character development and improbable situations which become unbelievable near the end of the book. I only finished it because I kept hoping it would improve."
2,It was a tough act to follow,"The Secret Life of Bees is one of my favorite books, and I have been waiting anxiously for this novel to arrive. While Sue Monks Kidd is a talented writer, there is a huge hole in the story regarding the main character's life-long guilt, fostered by her own mother's lies. I kept waiting for the main character to confront her mother and hash it out, but it never really happens. The fact that a young child could be left to harbor such guilt while the mother just plods along selfishly is just too unappealing to me."
2,Let me count the cliches....,"A desperate housewife, a mysterious stranger with a tragic past, a crazy old woman, an assortment of eccentric, irascible but warmhearted southern women with cute names, interminable water imagery (drowning, eroticism, rebirth), an ending reminiscent of Daphne Du Maurier's ""Rebecca"", and dialogue out of a grade B romance (""He pulled the leather cord over his head, letting the cross drop to the ground...'I've wanted you from the beginning'""), and as overstuffed with metaphors,similies and psychobabble as a plump girl overflows her low-rise jeans.And for this I payed $25.00?"
2,How coud she?,"I have been a fan of Sue Monk Kidd for some time ,having read her books on spirituality and her essays and The Secret Life of Bees. That being said, I cannot believe how easily she fell from content to sappy-trendy. The concept of mid-life angst is far from new. I do not believe however that in real life, the consequences of actions for SOME people are nada and zilch. Or that it is of no consequence to betray those we love. How sad. And how disapointing.It is interesting to me that while we are to feel for the child that Jesse was, we should have little or no feeling for Hugh or her own daughter. It does not wash for me and seems to be a little paon to all that is bankrupt in the prevailing culture . Surely we can experinence growth without stamping on others.Or making them less important."
2,First novel just did too well...,"I have nothing against Sue Monk Kidd--she is a good writer. Although I was not nuts about SECRET LIFE OF BEES--this one makes the former seem to be masterful by comparison. At least there was heart and sincerity in SECRET...this is just a mishmash of concepts thrown about and again as others have also stated, there are the implausibility issues (I saw some of this with SECRET--but it's a bit worse here.) The mermaid chair is just not a believable object in this context. Just as the three nice black ladies opening their home and everything esle to these strangers is not so believable. But BEES did have charm and a warmth that so many readers responded to. The characters were likable! Not so--this."
2,"Bad, Bad, Bad...","After reading Sue Monk Kidd's previous brilliant work ""The Secret Life of Bees,"" I have to admit my expectations were fairly high. Not only was I disappointed in ""The Mermaid Chair,"" I genuinely felt let down. Ms. Kidd should have rested on her laurels rather than embark on such a boldly inferior effort. Alas, her publishing company didn't even do her (or us) the favor of pulling it before it got to the bookshelves.The ""plot"" drug hopelessly on, the characters were flat and the book on the whole failed to develop. Every one of the characters could have taken a flying leap off a cliff and I would have applauded.The reputation of her former work alone is not enough to make up for this drab and lifeless novel. Frankly, it's sad, because this author is capable of so much more. Don't waste your money. If you must, check it out of the library."
2,Don't Waste Your Time!,"This is a completely implausible tale, with poor character development, shallow portrayals of both marital & extramarital love, and unsympathetic characters. Need I say more?!!"
1,Don't WAste Your Time and Money!,"I stopped reading this book about half-way through. It was so insipid and boring, that nothing could make me continue. Thank goodness it was the library's copy, so I didn't waste several dollars. This woman has a loving, psychiatrist husband who tells her at least once a day that he loves her. But, she is ""unhappy in her marriage"" for some vague reason--never really explained. The minute she meets Brother Thomas on Egret Island, the two of them exchange several emotion-charged glances. After that, they both tell others that they think they are falling in love. Come on!!! How sappy can you get? I didn't hang around to read about the consummation of this burning love because I was nauseated by this time. I also, liked THE SECRET LIFE OF BEES, but this was an extremely weak second effort."
5,Truth-telling,"Sue Monk Kidd uses a lyrical story to tell truths about the human soul. She captured so many of the distinct pulls each of us faces in our own lives and how we negotiate the choices in our life. Loaded with whimsical symbolism, this book is astonishingly beautiful. I am immediately placing it on my favorite books list. Rarely do books speak to me the way this one did.........."
1,A Sleeper!!!,"I immediately snatched the last copy of ""The Mermaid Chair"" in the bookstore, as I was really anticipating a great book by Sue Monk Kidd. I really enjoyed reading ""The Secret Lives of Bees"" and have recommended it to all my friends. I was highly disappointed with the ""Mermaid Chair"". The characters are extremely weak, and story is very mundane and ordinary. I huge disappointment and a waste of money!!"
1,Hard to stay seated...,"I had to force myself to get through this book, all the time hoping that it would get somewhere. The fact is that the jacket says it all. So, unless you get enthralled by the description of swamps and marshes, read the cover, enjoy the chair, get up and leave!"
5,Excellent,"I was rather surprised to read some of the negative reviews of this novel. Like many reviewiers, I also, was a lover of ""The Secret Life of Bees."" And now I am a lover of this novel as well. If pressed, I would say I like The Mermaid Chair better.A well-written, vividly detailed story of a woman searching for herself in many of the ways we all do: through our creativity, our families, our sexuality, our relationships and our limitations. The relationships portrayed in this novel are heartbreakingly honest, honing in on the distances we must keep even from those closest to us.All of the mermaid imagery is beautiful and mystical and with the monastary set right on the island, religion becomes a character that looms throughout the plot.Descriptions of the island made me feel as if I were right there and could smell the ocean. The island itself seems to make a statement about how isolated our true selves are. This book is sad, beautiful and so honest. I couldn't put it down. Don't miss it."
2,The Mermaid Chair- Not all that great,"Okay, I read this book expecting to think it was great, since The Secret Life of Bees was. But it wasn't. I honestly felt like the author just... made this one up as she went along. It had a good idea to it, but it was all too familiar. Woman meets another man and falls in love. This sort of thing happensa all the time- why write a book about it and call it literature... I really don't think it was good. Jesse is a confused person- I can see why her mom is crazy too!I personally don't think someone should spend money on this just yet. Borrow it, go to the bookstore.... THEN decide."
2,not bees,"boring. some interesting descriptions. obvious writing talent, but truthfully the book stinks. it is predictable, and the characters are flat. sorry i cant get my money back."
4,Interesting concept,"I liked the story. The own, the people, all very believable. We all have a forbidden love and try to balance the should of, could ofs. Also, it was an easy read."
1,Very disappointing,"After being moved to tears by the story and the beautiful words of SECRET LIFE OF BEES I awaited the first day of THE MERMAID CHAIR with great anticipation. It's plesant and light, but nowhere near the depth and beauty of BEES and surprisingly predictable. The worst part was, after sticking with MERMAID hoping it would get better, the ending was just a big thud. If you absolutely must read it, don't waste your money on the hardcover. In my disappointment, however, I found THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL by Phillipa Gregory and give it 5 stars!!"
2,Unrealistic and under-developed,"The characters were under-developed and flat or two-dimensional. I was unable to feel sympathy for any of them, especially the selfish protagonist. It does portray yet another way that religious fanatacism can screw up people's lives."
1,"Stupid, utterly stupid.",Utterly disappointing read. Characters are dull and unbelievable and Monk loves to hear herself speak and she describes in looong boring detail the island you really don't care about. Plot is just stupid and surprise ending ubsurd. I loved Bees but will think twice before picking up another book of hers again. Not sure why I finished this one!
5,Enlightening!,"Any married, middle-aged woman can relate to the story and leave you feeling reflective on your own life and feeling renewed. A great summer read!"
2,Disappointing,"I went out and bought this immediately after finishing Secret Life of Bees, because I had enjoyed that so much. Unfortunately, I had to force myself to finish it! The story dragged, and the foreshadowing took away whatever mystery there might have been. Hated the main character (Jessie) - her self reflection was childish & her ""self-discovery"" was trite and stereotypical. Now, all that said - Kidd writes beautifully. This one just needed a better story & better characters..."
4,Beautiful language and emotion even if a bit unbelievable plot,I think that the language in this book was beautiful. She did a fantastic job of creating a picturesque scene of her island setting. I loved the voice of the main character and her emotional ride. I thought the story was a bit unbelieveable at parts and the ending was a bit forced. But I really enjoyed it and would read again.
3,Mindless entertainment,"This book is the most generic of Beach Books. Light and fluffy, with some Made For TV Movie drama thrown in (should she leave her husband? Why is her mother crazy?), it's engaging enough to be able to finish but I found it impossible to really like. The characters are standard (Crazy Mom, Sexy Other Guy, Hip Collegiate Daughter and the protagonist, while obviously supposed to be sympathetic and ""deep,"" comes off as too beige, self-important and indecisive to respect.If this book is lying around and you need to kill a few hours, go for it. But don't look for anything of intellectual value or moral character."
3,I hated the ending!!!!,"I was delightfully pleased with this book until I got to the end. The Mermaid Chair is an obvious retelling of Kate Chopin's The Awakening (solitude on an island, a married woman's mid-life awakening, the affair, dissatisfaction with marriage and current life, self-discovery through art), however Kidd ruins it instead of honoring it by giving it this sickning ""happy"" ending. I was completely on Jessie's side and everything made sense and then the air totally went out of the plot and destroyed everything that had been built up all along.The symbolism and use of spiritual icons was woven beautifully into the text as well as the family secrets hidden and revealed. I would have given this book 5 stars if it hadn't been for the pathetic cop out ending.Read Chopin's The Awenkening....the original is always better. Sorry Sue."
3,Missing the Buzzing of the Bees,"SMK has done her best to weave a tale of symbolism, lost souls, relationships, and discovery in this book which all - I appreciate.Lost, I was, on the references to the nature of the island and the nautical and maritime language. Part of me could care less if Whit was in a johnboat or a canoe but it kept my attention.SMK has a way of dropping this morsal of the story to latch onto at the end of each chapter. I was intrigued enough to keep going until the end of the book. Even though it had a different tone than ""The Secret Life of Bees"" I'm glad I read it. I will keep reading her books until the taste in my mouth is so overwhelming that I have no choice but to spit on the literature."
2,Just ok...,"It took me so long to get through this book even though it was an easy read. The main storyline, Jessie and Brother Thomas, is so boring. It is only her mothers storyline that kept me interested. I also enjoyed her mothers quirky friends. There are so many other books to read out there to waste time on this on."
2,Bestseller Bust,"Why this book is a bestseller baffles me. Perhaps the hype is based on style rather than content.This is a beatufully written book and the only thing that kept my interest was Sue Monk Kidd's wonderful use of metaphors, similes and lushly descriptive phrases. However the main character and her shallow personality dissapointed me. She just did'nt have a good enough reason to be driven to escape what appeared to me to be a great lifestyle with a very caring and intelligent husband. Also the mystery of her father's death has an unbelievable explanation. What I thought was going to be a juicy summer read turned out to be a very unsatisfying book."
1,DO NOT READ,"I read this book because I thought it had potential to be good= but about 1/3 of the way through I predicted everything that was going to happen and secrets that were going to come out. It was so predictable, not original at all, and definitely not worth your time."
3,"A little too ""fantasy""","The absolute best part of this book is the beautiful prose -- the writing is amazing. I love reading a sentence that captures an experience so perfectly -- and yet has never been quite articulated so precisely. This author's writing evokes that feeling in me repeatedly . . . not to mention making me want to move to an island in the Carolinas. But, unfortunately, the plot was just a little too over the top for me. I am not at all a fan of ""fantasy"", and some of the parts of the plot -- the mermaid mythology, the monastery, etc, just seemed ""unreal"". I also agree with other reviewers that the ""bored housewife"" leaving her husband and being inspired to paint again was a little tired and frankly felt a little self-indulgent on the part of the main character. It didn't evoke many feelings of sympathy in me."
3,Not 'The Secret Life of Bees',This book was laborious to read. The premise of the story is interesting but there is a lot of angst. Not nearly the magical book that Secret Life of Bees is.
3,not as good as the Bees,"I found this book to be a bit of a half effort from the author. I really enjoyed a Secret Life of Bees, but found this to be lacking in the same substance and depth. I could not relate to the main character in any way, I found her to be petty, tedious, irritating, self centred and unrealistic. The whole story seemed to be some sort of menopausal fantasy."
2,Mudbath,"""The Mermaid's Chair"" was a big disappointment after Kidd's spectacular first novel, ""The Secret Life of Bees"". A bored woman hooks up with, of all people, a monk, on a barrier island off South Carolina. Illicit sex in the mud follows, followed by cleaning up, both physically and morally. Not sure how I got through it--Kidd's descriptions of the the fauna of barrier islands helped."
4,Touching,I really thought Kidd touched on the inner soul of the character's struggles to find themselves in the midst of their personal struggles. I was deeply lost in the book from start to finish.
2,A letdown,"I LOVED Secret Life of Bees and I checked out the large print edition of Mermaid's Chair from the library. I couldn't even finish it -- I made it half way through, and still was not engaged. It lacked the richness of culture and understanding that Bees had, and seemed like another ""Oh, poor me"" book."
2,Dissapointing,"Boy, I sure expected a lot more from this book because The Secret Life of Bees was so well done. All the elements were in place for The Mermaid Chair to be just as rich, but instead, I was bored to tears with the one-dimensional charectors and embarrasing-to-read romance. (I'll take the Thorn Birds anyday).The mythological elements were also not explored to the degree that I hoped. What happened? She certainly knows how to turn a phrase and her descriptions of the natural world of the island were beautiful, however, I never warmed up to any of the people, not even the main charector, and toward the end, I felt like I was being forced to read journal entries of someone with meager insight into life. Bummer."
3,Indulgent,"I have not read The Secret Life of Bees, nor am I too keen to do so after reading The Mermaid Chair. The main character was far too self indulgent, and Kidd herself comes across as the same for writing this. I found the subplots more interesting than the main storyline--the actual mermaid chair's story is quite charming. Kidd overdoes the 'mystical woman' theme, but the book wasn't awful and I think it is passable as a flippant beach read or something to peruse on a rainy day."
4,Hmmm...I really liked it!,"I have not read Bees and I did not see these reviews before reading this book. I honestly came on to Amazon expecting to find a lot of people praising the book like I am inclined to. Perhaps I fit the main characters demographic just right because I found it quite good.The only thing I wasn't sold on was the way too quick ""falling in love"" between Br. Thomas and Jessie.I'd recommend it though."
3,Liked Secret Life of Bees Better,"I did enjoy this book, but in comparison to The Secret Life of Bees (also by Kidd) I was disappointed. I felt that this book had a few good chapters, but at the same time, I was reading just to get to the next interesting part. My favorite aspect of the book is the main character's paintings...I loved visualizing them."
3,The Mermaid Chair,"After her first blow-out novel, The Secret Lives of Bees, this came as a disappointment. It was interesting enough to hold my attention to the end, but I found the subject matter (vows broken too easily) somewhat disturbing/disconcerting. And the underlying mental illness of the mother was never resolved to my satisfaction."
1,Can't believe it won the Quill Award,"I loved The Secret Life of Bees but I found this book to be formulaic and uninteresting. Its difficult to like any of the characters, especially the main character, and much of the scenes with the monk are sexually gratuitous. It has as much deapth as a Harlequin romance novel. The relationship between her and the mother was a bit more dimensional but only slightly. All in all, a poor follow-up to Sue Monk Kidd's break out bestseller. Don't waste your time."
1,"A sad, predictable, disappointing novel","What a disappointment after The Secret Life of Bees, which I loved for its character development, symbolism, strong female characters, etc... The Mermaid Chair would probably never even have been accepted by a publisher if it weren't for Bees. The main character is predictable, shallow and pathetic. What a sad commentary on mid-life and female weakness. I listened to the audio book and was also quite disappointed in the quality of the reading and the poor attempt at a southern accent by the reader who couldn't even pronounce Raleigh correctly."
2,Bridges of Madison County meets The Thornbirds,"I loved ""Secret Life of Bees"" and ordered this book on faith, without having read anything about it. Although I enjoyed the sense of place and the creative use of imagery and myth, I found the story itself sappy and the heroine uninteresting. There was nothing new about the empty-nest, mid-life crisis, controlling husband angst, and the love-at-first-site hokeyness of the forbidden romance was unworthy of this writer. Sometimes I wonder about the pressure that the publishing world must place on a new writer to quickly produce a novel that can compare with one that might have taken her years to produce and perfect. I will not give up quite yet on Sue Monk Kidd, but I was quite disappointed in this trite story."
2,So disappointing,"I had been looking forward to Sue Mon Kidd's next novel since reading the marvelous Secret Life of Bees. And man am I disappointed. The basic storyline? A self-absorbed and privileged white women takes a self indulgent oddysey, carefully masked as spiritual awakening. Especially annoying was her tendency to rationalize her extramarital affair, basically based on sexual attraction, as life-affirming, spiritually awakening... love. Pa-leeze. Enter her Mother's two friends, straight out of a Lifetime Network movie, a great husband who is somehow a villain for what? Not insisting that his wife find her own life? and a cast of bitter characters in a monastery, and you have a novel. I have no problem with characters with feet of clay. What annoyed me was the dishonesty of cloaking the novel as a spiritual awakening."
1,A disappointment,"I loved The Secret Life of Bees and was expecting to love this one. I was very disappointed. I may as well have read a Harlequin romance. The plot was a predictable cliche, the characters were unsympathetic, and it was boring. I would recommend readers skip this one and hope the next novel is better."
1,"monks, & dogs, & weak women, oh my!",The Mermaid Chair lacks all things belonging to a quality novel. The characters are undeveloped and flat in likeability. The story itself is a joke without the uplifting laugh to follow. And it may just be the most predictable book ever entered into print. Please don't let your time go to waist on a superficial mind-dulling book as this when there are so many incredible and intelligent novels abounding.
2,"Not On A Par With ""Bees""","The first several chapters of The Mermaid Chair were, to me, very satisfying and interesting. Then I began to be bored with a very familiar plot and that's when I began skimming through the rest. Jessie Sullivan's dalliance with Brother Thomas was very predictable, and I thought the reasoning behind her mother chopping off her fingers was rather far-fetched. We're teased throughout the whole book with the death of Jessie's father and then the whole story was rather anti-climatic.I was disappointed after thoroughly enjoying The Secret Life of Bees."
3,A bit of a disappointment,"I must admit that I was really looking forward to The Mermaid Chair because I loved Secret Life of Bees. However, although Kidd is an indisputably talented writer, I found this book to be far too predictable. Without giving out any spoilers, I knew the ending way before it happened!I also did not find the story line about the mother to be plausible. If that had been my mother, I certainly would have kept a better eye on her after her distructive behavior.Having said that, I did feel compelled to finish the novel and I really enjoyed Sue Monk Kidd's lush writing style. I just thought that Bees had much more humor, feistiness and substance than The Mermaid Chair.Sigrid Macdonald. Author of D'Amour Road."
3,The Mermaid Chair,Our book club read this selection for September 2011. None of us were thrilled with it. It was an unsatisfying read. ALL of the characters needed to get the senses knocked into them.
3,Great SC coastal descriptions,"This novel paints such a beautiful picture of SC's coastal barrier islands/low lands that I could smell the salt marshes and hear the egret's cry. If only the story had been as good. For me it was predictable and ended abruptly, an uncomfortable but neat little package all tied up -- just not believable at all. The internal struggle, infidelity with a monk, the whole Saint tie-in just didn't ring true. The mother's behavior was interesting and I loved the idea of three long time friends holding a mystery but as I said before it just felt as though everything ended so abruptly, revealed in the last few pages. The book wasn't a waste of time, it was an okay read -- it had the potential to be better."
2,two star rating generous,"i gave it a 2 star because i liked the setting, that is all i liked..this was drivel..the main character was annoying and making excuses for her life, unappreciative and spoiled. its as if this book was written by someone else. it certainly cannot be compared to the secret life of bees."
2,frustratingly unsympathetic characters,"I had difficulty getting drawn into this story because the author does little to explain the characters' motivations for their actions, which are seemingly inexplicable until the end of the book. The main character, who is married to a good man and has a daughter, falls for another man who is a monk at the church where her mother works. By the time the author gives insight into the cause of her adulterous feelings, one has already begun to dislike the main character. The mother's violent acts of self-mutilation are incomprehensible since the author keeps the cause of her pain a secret until the end of the book. Even the father's mysterious death is not explained until the last few chapters. This book was frustrating because the author does not disclose anything to make you care about these characters until the final moments of the story."
2,taken from several other books,"I was disappointed in this book. I loved Bees so much and couldn't wait to read it, only to discover the plot and characters are stolen from several other books we all have read: The Thorn Birds and the Ya-Yas. She throws in Catholic symbolism because it worked with the first book. She puts in mermaid allusions ""just because""...trying to be symbolic and follow her theme but so obvious it goes nowhere..."
3,Sue Monk Kidd didn't have her heart in this one,"I absolutely inhaled ""The Secret Life of Bees"". I was so excited to see Sue had written another novel. From the beginning, I could sense that there wasn't as much energy in this book. Although I loved the unique friendships involved, I was left flat by most of this book. I will not give up on this fantastic author, though. We all get in a rut sometime or other."
2,Sue Monk Kidd Wrote This Beach Book????,"""The Secret Life of Bees"" was an extraordinary book in every way, and I recommended it to and bought it for many, many friends. ""The Mermaid Chair"" surely was not written by the same author! What a vapid, one-dimensional potboiler! The heroine was a complete moron, apparently in a wife/mother coma after 20 years of marriage. The monk--well, what was so bloody irresistible about him other than his ""denim"" blue eyes? The poor husband, although also a caricature, held promise but was never developed into a real-enough person so I cared that much about him either. SAVE YOUR MONEY! This is a library beach book!"
1,dissapointing,"I thought that this story would have been much better without the affair. It just did not make sense at all for her to fall for this monk right off the bat. The rest of the story had some intresting parts but not enough to make it a worthwhile read. I liked ""The Secret Life of Bees"" so much more."
2,So disappointed,"""The Secret Life of Bees"" is one of the best books I've ever read. Maybe that's why this book was so disappointing. As other reviewers said, it's the same old plot, same old character(s). Where was the rich imagination and creativity seen in ""Bees""? I forced myself to the end, but it was not an enjoyable read. I just kept hoping it would somehow get better---and her writing is beautiful. but not enough to carry this shopworn story. I'm interested to see what her next book will be like."
3,Nothing special,"After reading The Secret Life of Bees, I was ready to be thoroughly impressed with Kidd's next novel- sadly, it did not deliver. The book was very readable, but nothing special. I recommend this book as an easy summer read, but not a necessity."
1,disappointing,"Sigh. I loved Secret Life of Bees and was really looking forward to this book but it falls flat, in my humble opinion. I am not done with it yet (am on page 205--can anyone tell me it gets better?) but the writing and characters, and the setting and plot do not measure up with the drama of Secret Life. So far in the book, the main protagonists, Jessie and Whit, are so shallow and cliche, their arguments for breaking their respective vows are not convincing. Jessie separates from her husband in a conversation that took about two paragraphs and he went running back to the mainland....that just seemed weird to me. There are some ""sort of"" interesting characters, Kat and Hepzibah for example, but they are not enough to save the book. I am going to soldier on to see how it ends, but it is painful. The author had a real problem here in that Secret Life was a tough act to follow. Ms. Kidd should stick with chronological adolescents, not middle aged people acting like adolescents."
1,Danielle Steele in Kidd's Clothing??,"From page one to its end, I adored, The Secret Life of Bees, and waited hungrily for Kidd's next novel -- and paid the big bucks for the attractive hard-cover. Wish that I had read Amazon's readers' reviews before I dropped my 20 dollars for a another sappy romance novel."
2,No feeling of truth in any aspect,"I do agree with all those who say the book was a thinly veiled pulp romance whose main character had no substance. But even worse for me was the fakeness of the description of the South Carolina coast - or rather, it felt as if it were a description from the viewpoint of a tourist looking at the scenery from within an airconditioned bus. For instance - the memory of the father taking his kids to see the time between ebb and flood - any other islander knows that from before they can remember. And somehow the leaving out of the immense amounts of insects and humidity left me wondering how the author could possibly live in a house on the edge of marsh. I bought the book for that description (not the insects per se, but the essence) - and finished it wishing that someone else would write the book I'm still looking for."
2,Well written Shmaltz,"I loved Bees and I am so disappointed! Although the imagery is wonderful, it gets old after awhile. I got tired of the protagonist wallowing in all her cliched 40 something feelings of despair and emptiness. Erotic? I don't think so. It was like reading Danielle Steele at her shmaltziest.I was irritated that the protagonist's plain old honest to goodness lack of maturity was portrayed as soul searching, and that a suicide would be viewed as anything other than a coward's way out. Because I like to believe that there are some elimental truths about life and spirituality, this story completely rubbed me the wrong way. All the main characters were victimized by one thing or another and I would have liked to see at least one of them realize that, as an adult, being a victim is a choice."
2,Whew! What a switch!,"Wow. Just when I finished a few good reads, I wind up with this lousy mess! I am one of the thousands who absolutely enjoyed SECRET LIFE OF BEES--though it was a bit silly, you couldn't help but like all those gals and really, just about every thing about that charming little story. I was sure that others might have been a bit too harsh on Sue Kidd and her latest work--but boy oh boy,,,this is indeed, a let-down. So wish it were not so, though. In sum? Skip it and pick up: THE MEMORY OF RUNNING instead."
2,"An Essay on ""It's All About Me""--- Mermaid Chair","Secret Life of Bees was one of the best books I've read in awhile and I couldn't wait to read Mermaid Chair. What a dissappointment. I have a hard time enjoying a book when I really don't like the main character and I didn't like Jessie. She was the embodiment of today's attitude of it's all about me and no caring of who gets hurt along the way. The story is ridiculous, not even the least bit believable. Monks condoning adultery? Secret poisonous plants? Some of the descriptions of the South Carolina coast were enjoyable but nothing compared to the lyrical quality of Bees. To bad I wasted money on a hardback as it's not a book that will be reread for years to come. Look for it in my next yard sale."
3,Not what I expected . . .,"When choosing this book, i made the mistake of picking it almost completly because of the title and cover when i should have come to my trusted costumer reviews on amazon!This is a unique story of a married woman returing to her home town when her mom cuts off her own finger. The woman soon falls deeply in love with a monk. Little did I know how perverted this woman was. I found the book deeply disturbing, and gave up and returned it. However, I was never a big fan of Sue Monk Kidd, so if you have enjoyed her books, then I definatly think you will enjoy this one as well. I don't recommened it to anyone who is under middle age. As much as i did not benefit from the Mermaid Chair, I hope you do!"
3,I really disliked this book,"Actually to be more specific I really disliked the main character Jessie. I am glad to see others saw her as insensitive and selfish as I did.I gave it a three because the scenery was wonderful and the other storylines were interesting. But Jessie's navel gazing ""search for her inner self""? Nope -now I know why I like mystery novels than a lot of these ""best sellers"". Thank goodness this was a very easy read and took me less than a day to read-otherwise it would have been a bigger waste of time."
2,Second Time is Not a Charm,"When an author debuts a novel as fine in plot, characterization, and emotion as ""The Secret Life of Bees,"" subsequent novels run the risk of falling short in comparison. Even in that context, ""The Mermaid Chair"" lacks the reasonance and poignancy I found and loved in ""Bees."" Readers will find the same interesting, obscure female religious icons and circumspect, self-defined faith, but likely will fail to find Jessie Sullivan as engaging as Lily Owen. Two storylines intersect in ""The Mermaid Chair,"" but neither is especially compelling. It's not a bad novel, per se, just not what you might expect from Kidd's stellar fiction debut."
1,An Attack on the Catholic Church,I read through half the book and realized it was an attack on the Catholic Church. A priest helping someone commit suicide in a Catholic Church? I am offended. And is Monk your real middle name or a further attack?
2,Eh,"I could care less about this book. It was boring and I only bought it because it was in the grocery store. Now I know why it was near the suppositories. Though the book wasn't horrific, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
4,The Mermaid Chair,The Mermaid Chair is a testiment to womens' ability to love and rediscover themselves. It's worth a read.
3,WHERE WAS THE SOUL,"I was very disappointed in the story. I did not like the main character Jessie. She seemed to weak. I also felt she took an extraordinary chance by what she did in having an affair with the monk.It was not the fact that he was a monk, it was that if you are going to give up your life as you knew it, and your husband of many years, that person would have to show me his soul. I would have to see his heart in his eyes. I felt this did not happen in this story."
2,The Mermaid Chair,"All I kept thinking through this book was, ""Does this woman have no friends!?!""All she seemed to have to lean on was her mothers two best friends and her daughter. The book never hints that she was nothing but a mother/wife/artist working away in her studio. She never went out, never called anyone to talk to beside the few listed above. If my mother chopped her finger off, I think I would call some of my friends.Even though the affair part totally put me off, I did like when she made a string knot with herself and was attempting to find out who she was. Hopefully when she went home she would try to find her way out of her bubble life."
2,Gothic yarn,"I loved Secret Life of Bees and was disappointed in this book. The main character's indulgent mid-life crisis and affair inflicts hurt on a good, loving, husband and on a monk-to-be in crisis. Wacky mother allows daughter to believe that she was partially responsible for her father's death.Too much ""me, myself and I"" in this cruel gothic tale. Throwing one's self at a monk-to-be on one of your first few days back home - foreseeing the hurt that will ensue for everyone? Brother! My distaste with her began at that moment. Her ""it's all about me and my crisis"" extended thoughts and actions became annoying and irritating."
2,disappointed expectations,"I ordered this book based on the author's name alone; I have all of Kidd's books and they have been pleasing additions to my library, This time I was disappointed. The bizarre plot elements in Mermaid were distracting and disturbing, more Stephen King than Sue Monk Kidd. While reading, the accompanying mental chatter of, ""I can't believe this is a Sue Monk Kidd book."" and 'Who can I give this to so I don't feel like I wasted my money?"" kept me outside the book, a mere reader grounded in reality, unable to slip into that desirable state of observer and listener inside the story. Granted, I was expecting, hoping, for something more in line with ""Bees"", something more heartwarming, more loving, more believable, more nurturing. I couldn't finish it. That said, I still look forward to her next book."
3,It did not capture me,"I really like Sue Monk Kidd, and I LOVED the secret life of bees. For some reason I simply could not get into The Mermaid Chair."
2,Ick.,"I rarely return a book to the library without finishing it but this was one of those. I found the main character to be self-absorbed, narcissistic and lacking in character. What kind of person commits adultery with a monk she's known for about 2 minutes? I just didn't like her enough to want to know anything about her and I found her constant self-analysis to be self-serving and tedious. I finally skipped to the end to see what happened and didn't even care enough about her to want to flip back a few pages and figure out how her father really died. The stuff about her mother cutting off her own finger I just found to be contrived and gratuitous."
1,What a disappointment!,"Having loved The Secret Life of Bees, I was all psyched for another good read. However, the Mermaid's Chair pales in comparison. The characters are not very well developed, the plot is predictable, and the language lacks the elegance of that found in the Secret Life of Bees. As a matter of fact, it is hard to believe that these books were written by the same author."
2,Disappointing,"I was so anxious to read this book after completely loving The Secret Life of Bees, and all I can say is I was completely disappointed. It was so predictable and typical-bored housewife falls for the taboo monk....gimme a break! I felt it was forced fluff, just to put another title on the shelf. Sue can do so much better, this was a total let down."
2,The Mermaid Chair,"This book disappointed me. I had heard such wonderful things about the Secret Life of Bees (which I did not read), that I had high hopes for this book. The Mermaid Chair actually tells two stories, and the author makes little effort to tie the two together. In fact, the affair the protagonist has with a Benedictine monk seemed gratuitous and certainly not necessary to the story about the protagonist's parents. There were a few beautifully expressed passages, but most of the prose was overdone and embarrassingly so in some cases. I would not recommend this book. I could not wait for it to be over."
3,"Three and a half stars, really","I adored The Secret Life of Bees, so I had high hopes for The Mermaid Chair. I like the spirituality of this author, along with her beautiful writing and imaginative, rich stories.Unfortunately, the heroine of The Mermaid Chair seemed self-indulgent and somewhat callow. Her mother cuts off her finger and her response is to descend into a newly discovered adolescence? I understand the need for individuality--really, I do--but one doesn't often have to go to the extremes the protagonist does to find it within.I found myself judging the characters rather harshly--and normally, I'm pretty accepting (I read and love Andrew Vachss' books, for heaven's sake!). Despite the beauty of the writing, and the richly thought-out storyline (I love the mermaid chair aspect, as well as the mermaids and myths embedded in the book), I was disappointed in this novel.I'm not sure if the flaw is in me or the book, but there you have it."
1,Contrived and Unconvincing,"What a contrived plot line! Nothing about it made me think of real people, character development or fine writing. It read more like a banal romance novel. Read a classic to remind yourself of the difference between this book and master craftsmanship. The author must have been pressured to capitalize on her ""Secret Life of Bees"" novel."
2,Mermaids not so bee-witching,"Kidd's novel shares some threads of the tale she wove in the successful Secret Life of Bees; however, Mermaid Chair falls short of expectations. It is difficult to make a personal connection with the protagonist, particularly since the development of Jessie Sullivan is poorly constructed before she immediately falls in love with island monk-hunk Brother Thomas. How can the reader care about Sullivan or why this romance is important so early in the novel? Also, Kidd awkwardly throws in 1980s references here and there to lend credibility to this flashback. I found it to be an annoying, pedestrian, and sometimes painful read. I had to truly fight to just jump to the last chapter to put myself out of misery."
1,hardly made it through,"I actually listened to Secret Life of Bees on tape, a first for me. I would give it a five, and it's the reason I picked up this book. It was a mistake. I read pretty much anything, but I could hardly make it through this one, and gave it away immediately when done. There were too many things going on in the book, and not one of them felt real to me."
2,Thought it would be better....,"I LOVED ""The Secret Life of Bees"", so I was really looking forward to this new novel.This was nowhere near as well written as the first. The characters were boring and self-centered, and I didn't really care about them at all - which was such a difference from her first novel. Half-way through the book I wondered if I even cared enough to finish it, but I finished it anyway."
2,You've got to bee Kidding me ...,"Dear Sue,As one of your most supportive readers--I found The Dance of the Dissident Daughter brilliant--I must say that The Mermaid's Chair reflects a complete return to a stereotype of dominant patriarchal culture, where women need men to be happy. I agree with one of the previous reviewers who stated that from now on you should again write from the heart (remember St. Benedict's admonition to listen to the words of the heart). Jessie's actions in The Mermaid Chair just didn't ring true in this bodice ripper, sad to say. Much serious material got left by the wayside because of the sexual obsessions of the main characters.I'll look forward to your future writings, which I hope will plunge a little more into the true depths of female spirituality."
3,Oh well...,"The Secret Life of Bees was absolutely the best book I'd read in years, and I do a lot of reading! That's why I was so excited when The Mermaid Chair was released. Unfortunately, the book did not live up to my expectations. I found the characters thin and uninteresting and the ending hopelessly ordinary...almost like a gigantic sigh and an ""oh well"" statement of resignation. I love the unusual images Kidd uses, but this time even a mermaid-turned-saint couldn't save the story."
2,The Mermaid's Chair,"An obvious plot with ""wooden-like"" characters and an improbable, but predictable story line, The Mermaid's Chair became a forced-read for the sake of my book group. While the author does a fine job of describing places, she lacks the ability to adequately develop characters beyond a superficial level. It read like a made-for-TV script."
3,Not as Good as the First,"I was disappointed that Kidd seemed to preach rather than take us on the incredibly sacred journey in The Life of Bees. Except for the marsh scenes, I thought the characters trite and without magic. In my opinion, Kidd seemed to hold back on characterizations and instead on a plot that was formulaic and not very enlightening--even the end was predictable. What happened to those richly sensouous women she capably rendered before? Why did she not risk everything this time? I gave her a 3 (3 minus) because I want to believe she will write another novel capturing the essence of feminine, female spitituality."
3,Actually...,"This book was not as interesting as The Secret Life of Bees, but it does possess the same kind of character that sought and captured lives they wished for themselves. The main character does have interests and hobbies, like ... painting. The situation is real and the drama that insues is real. Overall the book is okay and if you are a Kidd fan then I would not let this book pass you by!!!"
1,Terrible.....,"I was so excited when this book came out after all i had just read Secret Lives of Bees and was so happy to have another Sue Monks Kidd book. WOW was i disappointed. It read very very slow and i was tempted to stop in the middle but couldn't do it. On average i read about 1 book very other day, this book took me four days...sooooooooooo boring. I hope the next one will be better!"
4,It Tore My Heart,"I'm almost 20 years younger than the main character of this novel, but her choices tore me apart. Did you ever wonder if you are with the right partner? Have you ever taken time out of your own life to do something for you, or has it all been for your children, husband, mother etc.? I do not envy the choices the main character in this novel made, but I feel I learned a bit more about myself."
2,Dull,"I was a huge fan of ""Secret Life of Bees"" and even subscribe to Sue Monk Kidd's newsletter. What happened here? This was a lackluster and self-centered indulgence of the writer. The whole thing felt very forced and selfish. Did the success of her first novel ""get"" to her? I hope not. Perhaps ""Bees"" was just too hard of an act to follow. I closed the book and immediately passed it to a friend with a great deal of warning. Kidd's descriptions of the locale and the environment of this barrier island are charming and enthralling, but the characters are sorely lacking. It's hard to root for a protagonist when one doesn't give a whit about her/him."
4,I liked it...,"I picked this book up because it was on the New York Times Bestsellers' list, and knew that it was by the same author as The Secret Lives of Bees, which I'd heard lots of good things about.Although everyone else seemed to find it ho-hum per previous reviews, I found myself not being able to put it down. Had it not been 11:30pm, I probably would have finished it all in one sitting.Yes, the plot was predictable, and I don't think it's right to ditch your marriage just because it's gotten dull. However, I have to admit for awhile my romantic side was rooting for Jessie & Whit to get together.I also loved the descriptive language about the island, and all that it entails. One drawback, however---It seemed like this could have been a remake of The Prince of Tides by Pat Conroy, except with a female main character.All in all though, it was a good read, and if Bees is 10x better than this, I can't wait to read it."
3,The Mermaid Chair,"I looked forward to reading another Sue Monk Kidd novel. It was a perfect ""on the beach"" read for a mini vacation. I enjoyed it's subtle mystery, and entertaining romance. Very different from Bee's, but equally as fun to read. I would recommend it to any upper 40ish woman, who'd rather read at the beach than romp around in a bathing suit!"
3,Mermaid Chair,I thought this book was OKAY..I liked Secret Life of Bees much better. This story was short and just blah...I hope her next book has more depth to it.
2,"Reworking of ""A Secret Life of Bees""","If you haven't read ""A Secret Life of Bees"", start there instead. If you have, this is a slightly warmed over version--and one you can skip.The Mermaid Chair tells the middle-aged crisis story of Jessie, who is called back to her mother's home upon learning she has cut off her finger.There are few surprises here: the novel reads like an adult version of ""what I did on my summer vacation"", all of which can get set conveniently aside once Jessie returns to her safe, comfortable life. A tale that could be about growth and compassion, this one falls flat."
3,Not as good as the Secret Life of Bees.,"The voice in this book seems immature. Where is the regret for having an affair with a monk? So, the husband just forgives her and they live happily ever after? Why even mention the crazy story line about the mother? It just seems to me that the character in this book really doesn't care about anyone but herself. I wish there could have been more to this story than just another ""woman has affair / mid life crisis"" book."
2,The Mermaid's Chair,"After having enjoyed ""The Secret Life of Bees"", I was extremely disappointed in Sue Monk Kidd's new book. It is the typical summer ""chick book""....to be read in a beach chair, while breathing in the salt air and looking for your Monk in Shining Armour."
1,vulgar,"If vulgar language bothers you, don't read this book. I was listening to it on CD, and the first time the ""F"" word was used, toward the beginning of the story, the CD set was returned to the library, unfinshed. It disgusts me when authors ruin what could potentially be a good book with the use of unnecessary profanity."
4,Not as bad as everyone says,"Thank god I read the reviews AFTER the book. I borrowed the audio book from the library and perhaps the narrator is the reason my experience was pleasant because I didn't find the book contrived in any way.I classified this novel as an ""easy read"". One you can read between really engrossing books. I don't think it was nearly as bad as others have said, but I have also not read ""The Secret Life of Bees"", so I have nothing to compare to.I enjoyed it."
2,Formulaic and boring romance,"All in all, a very mediocre read. I was disappointed in this book, as I did enjoy reading ""The Secret Life of Bees,"" and this book had also received such high praise. The story line was only mildly interesting, and the book seemed very formulaic and 'blah' to me---writing was not exciting or original at all, in my opinion. The ending was inevitable, and I second what another reviewer stated: there is ""zero suspense"" or tension in this book. I almost put it down several times, as I was bored with it and exasperated with the main character. I don't think I'd recommend this to anyone, unless you really like formula-based romance novel type books."
3,not too bad.,"This was an interesting story, of midlife crises of possible mental illness,and of secrets and truths. I did find it a little slow at times but it was still a good story,with characters you can care about even with their flaws. Although some people think of this book as just a sad tale of a woman who has an affair I felt it was so much more than that and that the affair was all part of Jessie journey. What would you do if you get a phone call telling you your mother has chopped off a finger and that she did it on purpose?Especially after being estranged from her after your father dies when you feel to blame for it. The truth of her fathers death is at the heart of this book ,and I won't give any spoilers. Suffice it to say Jessie's journey takes some twists and turns for her to make her way back ""home"" to herself"
2,predictable and uneventful,"This book had nothing interesting about it. It was sappy and slow moving, full of random experiences of the main charaters that never developed into anything. The characters didn't make any sense and weren't at all likable. The writing wasn't terrible so it made it a bearable read."
3,Why the affair?,"I loved the Secret Life of Bees so much that I went out and bought the hardback copy of The Mermaid Chair when it came out. I try not to buy hardbacks and try to use my local library whenever possible. I regretted spending the money. The novel revolves around a middle age woman, Jessie, who is summoned home to her Southern island town to cope with her eccentric mother. Jessie was living a conventional life with her husband, Hugh. Once Jessie is on the island, she finds herself drawn to Brother Thomas, a monk who is soon to take his final vows. Jessie and Brother Thomas begin a rather torrid affair while she ignores her husband back home. I guess that's why I didn't like the novel. I understand women longing for someone new, and I understand a monk wanting a last fling. But I was rather annoyed that the novel centered around the affair."
2,Big Disappointment,"I loved The Secret Lives of Bees, but this book was a complete disappointment. The story seemed really contrived and the midlife crisis/love at first sight was just not believable. Then, the ending that was so built up towards just fizzled away."
3,Enjoyed it,"I too read ""The Secret Life of Bees"" first and LOVED it so I bought this and I too agree that this book is nowhere near as good as ""TSLoB"". That being said, I did enjoy ""The Mermaid Chair"". Parts of it were very touching and seemed very real..other parts, not so much. Overall, I liked it. Would I buy it as a gift for someone? Probably not. It was a good rainy Saturday read."
2,Not So Wrong Again,"I love to read!!! When I get a book like this that is highly recommended, I can't wait to start it. This one, I could not wait to plod through to the end. This is the second reading disappointment in two weeks, and it is good to learn from reading other reviewer's comments, that I am not far off the target. Sometimes I feel I'm too critical. I loved Secret Life of Bees."
2,Not Plasible,"I loved Secret Life of Bee's, so I had high expectations for this book......that were not met. The story is of an affair between a married woman and a monk in training. After meeting briefly, they initiate a relationship. I loved the build up of the Thorn Birds, but found this story hard to believe. I didn't feel drawn to the main character... I did finish it so for that I gave it two stars... (if a book is REALLY bad I don't even finish it)"
1,So Disappointed!,"I have never felt compelled to write an Amazon review, but this book pushed me into it. Our book club read Mermaid's Chair because we liked Secret Life of Bees: that story was original and creative, the characters were developed and interesting; and the prose was almost lyrical in places. I am thoroughly disappointed in Mermaid's Chair: the story is boring and just plain ridiculous; the characters are shallow and silly; and the prose is hackneyed. The end was so predictable that I had figured out most of it by p. 115. I have already given my copy away."
1,A disappointing second novel,"The Secret Life of Bees was such a good book that I was looking forward to reading Sue Monk Kidd's new novel, but this book was so bad that I wondered whether it was a previous effort that she'd pulled out of a drawer and submitted to capitalize on her earlier success. I read about 50 pages of it, then skimmed through to the end to make sure that all the hackneyed things I was sure would happen did. Not one character or one thing that happened in this book was true. Save your money!"
2,Skip this One,"I loved Sue Monk Kidd's other novel, ""The Secret Life of Bees""--this one however was a big disappointment.The story is disturbing at times and too crazy for me. The supposed heroine cheats on her faithful husband with a monk because she is bored. Her crazy mother chops her fingers off. The mermaid chair is the center of some quirky religious ceremony--too wacky for me. I was offended by the infedelity-no justification for that. To top it off the faithful husband doesn't ditch her. Could not relate to this book."
2,No More Kidd for Me,"I found this book to be VERY disappointing! I had high hopes after reading ""The Secret Life of Bees,"" but I complained to my husband for an hour after reading this. HOWEVER, if you are are about 40-50 or love those Harlequin romance novels than this might be for you. I just thought it was predictible. I also, regretably, found myself hoping the main character would fail rather than succeed.There were some things I found interesting but the romance aspect of her life overshadowed the rest. I'm not sure that I will be reading any more Sue Monk Kidd."
2,This is a Romance Novel,"I bought this book because I absolutely loved the Secret Life of Bees!I expected The Mermaid Chair to be as inspiring and complex, but it is merely a verbose, fluffy romance novel that caters to ""40-something"" women who are looking to live vicariously through the main character.A waste of time for those who are looking for more than a silly love story."
2,A Disappointment,"I was disappointed by this book. While - as usual - I enjoyed Monk Kidd's writing this story didn't work for me. Specifically I found her relationship with Whit (Brother Thomas) unnecessary. Not only did it not help the narrative, IMO, it lessened the story and the characters.I think the story would have been better if Monk Kidd had instead focused on the other aspects of the novel - Jessie's midlife discontent, her father's death, her mother's condition and her relationship with her mother, her relationships with her husband and daughter, the relationships of the other island women, more information on the Gullah culture, etc.There is no comparison to ""The Secret Life of Bees"" which I found magical and more compelling. Also Sue Monk Kidd's non-fiction ""Dance of the Dissident Daughter"" was, IMO, fantastic - and had a resounding impact on me.I would recommend other Sue Monk Kidd books before I would recommend ""The Mermaind Chair""."
2,"Not as good as ""secret life of bees""","I bought this book because I really enjoyed ""The Secret Life of Bees"". In Bees, the main character Lily is a strong, vibrant girl - someone you really root for and have an interest in. However, the main character for this novel, Jessie, is annoying and whiny."
1,Don't bother,"Don't bother with this contrived, predictable, overdone romance novel. If I wanted to read Danielle Steel I would not have picked up this book with high hopes. After Secret Life of Bees this is a horrible disappointment!"
2,Didn't like it.,"I just didn't get why Jesse would ruin her marriage to Hugh for the monk. I also didn't get that she was there to help her mother, but she didn't help her much since her mom went and did it again. It was all lost on me. I had to force myself to finish it."
3,Enough about this chair...,"Slow and not what I expected. The guy at the bookstore suggested it as a romance, yet it drags on for the first several chapters. I found the main character hard to relate to and boring."
3,The old cliche..,"the grass isn't always greener on the other side is true in this book. Although, knowing from the beginning what was going to happen it was a good read while I am stuck sick on the couch.However, I am more into her relationship with her mother and not so much a monk. At times I was bored with story but trudged on.I look forward to another book like The Secret Life of Bees!"
1,So many better books out there!,"I read this book because I did enjoy Sue Monk Kidd's other works. However, I hardly enjoyed this one. I found the main character extremely unlikable, whiney and self-absorbed to the point that I didn't care if she was happy, sad or torn. I eventually was so annoyed with the main character I didn't want to even finish the book; I did push through, though with hindsight, I wish I had just put it down and walked away."
2,Insipidness personified,"What a disappointment. It would be a rare reader who would care about these one dimensional characters. I do have to say, the ending brought it up to 2 stars. Sue Monk Kidd had to either make the husband a pastor or a psychiatrist to be that forgiving. And what a blase fling-never felt the 'heat'...enjoyed Secret Life of Bees and usually like a 'southern novel' setting, however, advise you not to waste your time."
1,Not Quite,"This tale had potential to mystify and beguile and most of what it did for me was to foster revulsion:Revulsion for the images called up by the actions of the mother who obviously had needed mental help for a long time, and for the casualness of the monk who blithely attempted to use physical sex to determine a spiritual outcome in his life.The mythical island described was beautiful, maybe to offset the ugliness of the selfish people involved in this slow-moving predictable novel."
1,Astoundingly bad,"Horrific writing. The story was terrible, it was bizarre, unrealistic and relates more to terrible romance novels than a true book. I was expecting great things (I loved the secret life of bees). This book was the worst I've read in a while!"
1,Read Bees instead,I should have read the mixed reviews before buying this book. I thought this book was very boring. The Secret Life Of Bees was a much better book with a better storyline. There are better books out there that deal with the theme of a mid-life crisis.Don't waste your time and money on this one!
2,I tried...,"The Secret Life of Bees was a wonderful, beautifully nuanced work of modern fiction, blending Southern gothic with mysticism and a modern look at the dynamics of family. This novel was, despite my best efforts to see otherwise, a somewhat beautiful mess. I applaud her effort, but to me, the characters never rose above the level of facile caricature, and at times I almost laughed aloud at the silliness of both the style and dialogue. Here's hoping the next is better. This author is truly gifted, but this novel is a well-intentioned flop."
3,No editor will edit you,"after you have a bestseller.This is classic sophomore slump. The book is readable enough, but it's no Secret Life of Bees, which was brilliant and original.An editor could have insisted that the author draw out the tension, rather than telling us on the first page, ""That was the summer I fell in love with the Benedictine monk."" Um ... what? Why should I bother to keep reading?I look forward to the next book."
1,The best part of this book is the cover,"The best part of this book is the cover. I am so disappointed. I cannot believe this is by the same author who wrote The Secret Life of Bees which is marvelous and moving. This might be her sophomore effort, but sophomoric is more appropriate a description.I found the writing clunky and her protagonist unlikeable. The husband is a sympathetic character and yet Kidd tries to manipulate the reader into rooting for Jessie to have an affair with a soon-to-be priest. I don't care if fictitious characters have moral failings, without them most books would have no plot, but this was just poor all the way around. Terrible, terrible characterizations and descriptions. Everything was contrived and forced--like a good writer trying too hard."
1,Mermaid Chair,"Very disappointed. It reminded me of a ""trashy"" Thornbirds.Read it for a book club - and only finished it for that reason."
2,I Wanted So Much More,"What happened here? As several other reviewers have mentioned, Kidd's previous novel, ""The Secret Life of Bees,"" was chock full of wonderful characters and beautiful writing. The Mermaid Chair feels like a rushed attempt to get something else into print. I didn't like the characters and thought the story simplistic. I actually liked the Mermaid references but wanted Kidd to develop them more. And though I raced through to find out the big secret, I was ultimately disappointed that there wasn't much to the ultimate revelation. Overall, a disappointing, depressing read."
1,not what I wanted it to be,"I had bought this book for my mother in law, as I was a huge fan of the Secret Life of Bees, but this one was a disapointment. She lent it to me when she was finished and I had a very hard time getting through it. I kept wishing that it would get better, and it never did. I did finally reach the end, after about 3 months, and was totally disappointed with the conclusion."
2,Squandered potential,"After the success of ""Bees,"" this author was guaranteed a wide audience for ""The Mermaid Chair,"" and starts out with an intriguing premise - a woman in transition revisiting her childhood home before moving forward with her life. Unfortunately, the characters are poorly drawn, and the protagonist is narcissistic, shallow and irritating. The book fails in its effort to capture the rhythms of southern life and the importance of female friendship so evident in Bees. Despite the order in which the books were published, I'm convinced that this book was written years ago by a writer who hadn't yet found her voice."
1,disappointment,"After reading ""Secret Life of Bees"", I could hardly wait for Kidd's latest offering. What a let down!! This book is self absorbed just like the main character! The story is ponderous and trite and lacks the realism of Kidd's ""Secret Life Of Bees"".I felt no affinity or relationship with the characters and in real life, (unlike this story) there are generally consequences for actions.In the end - I just didn't care..... about any of it, but was frustrated that I had spent valuable time reading such a disappointing offering from Kidd."
1,"A tiresome, overworked, freeform poem",This is the story of a 42 year old woman with no other compelling features than a dedicated self absorption and spiritual short sightedness. The author frames all this nonsense in rapturous verbiage. No spoilers because I did myself a kindness and gave up after chapter 28.(It's even worse as an audio book - like Auntie reading recipes aloud.)
4,Mrs. Claus,After receiving the item it was a bit more plain than it appeared in the photo. I thought it had eyelet around the border. However my wife put a holly leaf on the side and it went great with her Mrs. Claus' outfit.
4,So cute,"This is the cutest stroller. It steers well and is very compact. However it is not for you if you are over 5'3"" I'm 5' and its just right for me but everyone else who's pushed it hates it they were all over 5'6"". It would acutally make a great gift for a little girl for her dolls."
2,wat a pain,the stroller is hard to push and the wheels jerk a lot in different direction and when it rains the child still gets wet... it is only good for store use...and only in sunshine weather....
5,Go Dana! Go Dana!,This Dana is great. My sis LOVES Meygan but she isn't mad at Dana. Dana came before Meygan Left. Dana is my sister's second favorite girl. You may have read my review on Formal Funk Dana. I don't know why people think Dana took Meygan's place because Meygan is back with Wild Life Safari and Secret Date (and more later on) I think we're really lucky cuz we live in Hong Kong and Bratz come out here before they do on Amazon. It's really cool. My sister couldn't get this Dana but she would like to.
5,The Best Dana Doll So Far,"I got this doll for my birthday and I 've played with it ever since! I t's makup is so pretty. The glitter and hair, all great! Although I'm turning 11 this year I still love Bratz dolls. and if your looking to buy your daughter a WinterTime WonderLand doll this is the one!Bye peeps,Michelle!"
5,its a relly good brat like you can take it in the snow,its a amazine brat you can take it in the snow it lasts long its supa cool they come with a skiet top jacket its just so cool
5,Phew! A Real Comeback since the Nighty-nite Collection!,"Normally, I won't use bad grammar, but most of you do, so why shouldn't I?i think this doll is much better than the other dolls mga has come up with lately. she actually makes something of her life - skiing, which can become profession later. the entire wintertime collection is great - if you want to get your child a bratz doll, whatever you do, don't get nighty-nite, or girlz nite out. instead, get this doll. she dresses fashionably, but appropriately."
5,I absolute love it!,"Hi, a few months ago,i finally realized i love Bratz. My friend Sharon,has so many dolls(i'm really jealous).She have about two rows of Barbies 'cus shes a big fan of barbie. That day her mom bought her a Cali girl ear piercing Summer and then Bratz Wintertime Wonderland Jade(they really got the fashions mixed up so Jade is actually wearing Yasmin's pink-a-licious outfit and things. After i went to her house i had been begging mom for one. That time Toys ""R"" us was like selling Barbies for buy 1 get one free. so now i have ONLY 2 barbies(boo)and guess what? that was my christmas present! but good news, mom said shes buying me a wintertime wonderland Dana or Cloe(their fashions are mixed so Cloe which is my favorite was wearing Dana's and Dana was wearing Jade's)and a my scene doll plus lots of other games. THANX MOMMY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Dana,"What I Liked:-The cute little accessories! How can you resist the little seal keychain, and cup of hot cocoa?-A nice selection of clothes. The Bratz dolls always come with more than one outfit.-The hair. Pretty, and easy to brush.What I Didn't Like:-It was expensive. It came with a lot of stuff, but still.-The beige and brown shirt was kind of hard to get on, but that's nothing big.-The doll didn't have the same cute face as the picture on MGAE.Com.Worth:I would say it's worth the money if you like Bratz.P.S. Please don't comment on this review. It's my opinion, and nothing you say can change that."
5,Cute doll,I got her for by birthday and i love her. She has nice hair and cute accesoreez. The stuff she comes with is durable. It is a god present for girl 9-13 but is probabyly no good for little kids. It was worth every penny. She is the best of the bratz!You MUST buy her!
3,Not that cool...,"These Bratz dolls are quite funky, but are not what I thought they would be. Bratz and My Scene are very simular, but the My scene dolls are much prettier and actually have feet, whereas the bratz only have little stumps. Also they are bigger than the bratz dolls and aren't as expensive.This doll is good, but don't waste your money on it.Sorry Bratz Fans!!!!"
2,Harry Potter meets pod races from Phantom Menace,"I have read all of Reilly's books and have enjoyed them all. Until now. I felt like I was forcing myself to finish the book simply because it was written by him and I am a fan. But as the previous reviewer mentioned, the story is quite juvenile and I was completely reminded of Harry Potter (racing school for talented kids) and the pod racing scenes from Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. If those two properties weren't heavy influences, I would be surprised. Unfortunately, now we have to wait at least another year before we get something new from Reilly here in the States. He wrote on his website that he will now be producing a book every two years rather than one. If you are a die-hard MR fan, then I guess you should read Hover Car Racer. But if you're looking for the hard-edged, gritty, adult action of his earlier books, skip this one."
4,If your a fan of Matthew Reilly you won't be disappointed.,If your a fan of Matthew Reilly you won't be disappointed. These are his earlier books but they are just as fun. For those unfamiliar with his style his books are probably written for 14 year old boys but can be enjoyed by anyone looking for a fun ride. Some of the action scenes are ridiculous to the point of being silly but that's the fun. As an adult I would describe it as a guilty pleasure sort of read.
5,Oh my G-d,"Yo this is sick. The best cutting by the best D.J.'s known to man. Get this now! Crazy up's to the boys in the 5102, Shap holding it down in the hill, and all the peeps at S&S!"
4,"If your not a DJ, you won't appreciate its greatness!","THIS ALBUM SOUNDS GOOD. HOWEVER THE 'X-MEN' ""EXECUTIONER"" ALBUM WAS BETTER AND MORE TRUE TO FORM."
1,Logitech KeyCase,"Just installed Logitech folding keyboard. It doesn't recognize half of the symbols.My advice: do NOT buy this item. I will order a folding keyboard, more reliable, I hope."
4,"I like it, but ...","I like the Logitech KeyCase. It gives me two things I needed for my Palm M130, a keyboard and a case. Overall, it compared with most of the other keyboards for the m130 that I tried out.I feel that they keys are a bit small and close together for my larger hands and thick fingers. If your fingers are thin or your hands are average size or smaller, the KeyCase would be a very good keyboard for your Palm.Having used other flexible keyboards, I was surprised at the responsiveness of the KeyCase. It wasn't nearly as mushy as I expected and was comparable to many other portable keyboards I've tested.Overall, I think that the KeyCase is a good value, very usable if you take into account the size of your hands, and is fairly priced. It also the attention to quality that I've experienced and enjoyed with many other Logitech products in the past."
5,Newbie to T'ai Chi,"I became interested in T'ai Chi just recently and I was recomended this video by friends. This is the perfect video for instruction. Just so you know this isn't a workout tape, this is set as instructions only. Which is a relife in itself because you don't have the feeling of needing to continue. I took my time with this video and feel it is certainly paying off. I feel more relaxed and more limber. I recomend this video for anyone just starting T'ai Chi because its a very easy flowing video."
3,Descent book...,"You can read this book and it is no doubt you will learn useful skill.On the other hand it is not a read which you can say it is ""wonderful"" or ""the most amazing book ever"" or "" it changes my point of view' etc. In my opinion it is just a descent book for selling."
3,Too many years and sizes,It's hard to pick out what goes with my motor because it covers so many different sizes and years. Seems complete enough but after getting it I gave up and took my boat to the marina for winterizing.
3,Heavy Beat Hard sound.,"I am a drummer from the old school. The Vater felt beater is as describe Hard Felt. I found it too hard and heavier for what I needed. A bit of a Slap sound from impact. I recommend the Vater Hard Felt for a larger Bass drum 22"" or bigger. I finally found a medium felt beater that meet my needs. Hope this helps you...Boom."
2,Quality is bad!!!,"Quality is bad!Looks so cheap,is not worth the price! And it is does not work.I think part is broken during the shipping........I bought it for my niece's Xmas gift,so, I am disppointed."
4,Educational Insights Micrpro 48,"Little scientist loves it!! He has found more things inthe house to view and study. It is simple, but shows magification fairly well."
3,micro,Needed to know that this was recommended for 3+..my 13 year old grandson will probably not be very impressed and I got it to late in the season [christmas] to get him anything else.
2,"""High"" setting has poor focus","This is exactly what it says: a toy. The ""Low"" and ""Med"" settings work well, however, the ""High"" setting has very poor focus leading to blurry, barely visible, views, and this is why I would not buy this item if I had another chance. The accessories it comes with are nice, but do not add much value to the microscope."
1,Waste of money!,I bought this item for my son for Christmas. It is very poor quality. It broke right away. Do not waste your money on this piece of junk!
4,Great for budding little scientists!,"My son (8) did have a little trouble learning to focus the slides at first, but quickly got the hang of it. We've only had it for a month or so, but the die cast metal body seems very durable. The light underneath is not great, it works much better for us on a table near a window or below an indoor light. We have not yet tried making our own slides, but he has had fun so far looking at the prepared slides. We bought ""The World of the Microscope"" with this and it has helped a lot to explain things and give him new ideas."
2,made very cheap,My 6 year old was very excited to open this microscope on christmas morning. It lasted about 10 minutes. The focus knob on this microscope is made of plastic and the plastic gears were striped so the toy is useless. Overall this toy stinks and was a huge disappointment. If it wasn't made so cheap it would have been awesome.
2,The light never worked,The light never worked. The wires are all messed up. I should have returned it with all the other made in china crappy toys that I bought my kids for Christmas.
3,Works good,Works really good but it is kinda hard to align to be able to see through for a younger kid
4,good for the money,"I gave this to my grandson for Christmas. He is 10. The suggested age for this microscope is 6, but I can't imagine a child that young using it on his own."
2,okay,based on the price you get what you pay for. he loved it it made him very excited. however the settings aren't very good.
1,"Note, Does Not use Rechargeable AA Batteries","I don't know why, but the instructions say, ""Do Not Use Rechargeable AA Batteries."" This might not affect many but you should know this. Also know that the microscope is small but small children do not have the coordination to use the scope. The My First Lab Microscope is a much better buy."
4,Great first microscope,I got this for my 10 year old son for Christmas. He loves it! Great microscope for a budding scientist. It comes with everything he needs to make his own slides and the magnification fields are very clear.
4,"Good value for the money, but it is a toy scope","Bought the microscope for my 9 year old son and overall I am very happy with the microscope. It is a great introductory microscope, but it is a toy microscope. If he does take to it definitely have to spring for a better one, but for short money it is a great introductory microscope."
4,Good as a starter Microscope,"Bought this for my 8 yr old daughter for Christmas. She has had a blast with it. It's a very good starter set, for looking at larger objects i.e. plant cells, hair root, etc. Not the best for looking at smaller objects i.e. bacteria, protozia, etc. Very easy to use. It has it's own light source which is nice also."
1,GeoVision MicroPro Microscope,Purchased this microscope as a Christmas gift for grandson. The light did not work from the beginning - even after changing out the light bulbs. Truly a piece of junk. It was truly a disappointing gift for our grandson. I want to return it and get my money back!
1,Not good enough for a toy,"I have tried several kids microscopes. This one is not even good enough to be a toy. The lenses are of extremely poor quality. Even the slides that came with it are not viewable due to the lenses and the very poor lighting. So, beware! This is truly a piece of junk."
4,Microscope set 48 piece,"This doesn't meet my needs not to say itsbad? no..in fact i will be giving it to a cousin,makes for a nice gift to a child."
1,returned....,Had to return this item the day after it was given as a gift for my son. Both light bulbs that came with it burnt out literally seconds from turning them on. The make of the microcope was not at all durable and the eye piece seemed small. This was not a product with kids or ease in mind. Ended up spending a tad more and getting the 'My First Lab Duo-Scope'...and would highly recommend that product.
2,"Kids love it at first, but the fun goes away as limitations arise","Now I purchased this knowing that it was a toy, I wasn't expecting great quality and I was correct to think that way. The optics are terrible and it is very hard to view anything. I ended up putting a flash light on the mirror to give better results for her.Overall she loved it at first, and that is what I wanted to see, if she would like this sort of thing. But spend the money on something better that will give you years of education rather than a few hours."
1,Low Quality,"This is too low quality product. I am a school teacher, we have these ones in a corner and had to buy new microscopes. When the light piece dies, so does the microscope, as the mirror piece does not work well. Focusing is hard, especially for the High setting. I am not satisfied at all with this product. I suggest to you, don't buy this one."
3,Easy to setup and use but cheaply made,"We really liked this telescope, it was easy for my son to setup and use (he is 6), but the second time he used it the thread inside the focusing knob stripped and stopped turning. He was very disappointed and we ended up sending it back and getting a refund."
4,Microscope,Great gift for the price. It isnt a professional set by any means but that was not the intention of purchasing it anyway.
3,Not happy,"Got this for my son's 8th birthday, he'd been excited to use it, but it came with one light bulb already burned out and the second burned out the first time it was used. I tried to contact the company 3 times for replacement bulbs and only received automated messages saying replacement parts would be sent 5 days after receiving the information from me. That was 2 months ago. We still haven't received any replacement lightbulbs, and we can't get our own because the manual doesn't include information on the type to get."
1,"Very Cheap, Poor Optics","This should be sold strictly as a toy since it lacks any real scientific value. It is very cheap, mostly plastic and low quality. The optics are horrible and the stage is made of a flimsy plastic. My son stopped using it because he was straining his eye trying to focus and keep things steady. The paint was chipping off around the battery cover, and since it's made overseas, I was also concerned about that. I'm sending it back.Note: I see this company has 2 different models, and from the pictures and descriptions the microscopes are the same, but with different accesories and a different magnification eyepiece."
1,"What ""quality"" are they talking about?","I purchased this scope from a local school store as a gift. Within minutes my nephews were asking for my help focusing. I thought the excessive scratches on the lenses and slides were to blame, only to discover the eyepiece/lenses didn't even line up with the hole through which the light is coming through in the platform! What a waste of money. I'm disappointed that quality-control for a company would allow this product to be sold, nevermind made! (The difference between the models manufactured by this company vary only in the even cheaper painted-plastic ""accessories"" that actually, laughably, are labeled with ""Warning: sharp object"" labels!) I'll be calling the company first thing in the morning for a refund so I can purchase something that the boys can actually use!"
1,Don't Buy This!,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas last year. Within the first hour, it blew a lightbulb. The included replacement bulb lasted about two hours. I called the company and they sent me a new one. This one didn't work at all! And...it took forever to arrive. This is a terrible product and I wouldn't waste my time or money with it."
2,Not overjoyed with the quality but...,"Got this for my 8yo daughter and she has fun with it. In the product description it touts itself as having a die-cast body but in reality, it is mostly plastic and is a rather flimsy piece of equipment. The optics are ""cloudy"" at best and not very good. I have not experimented much with trying to improve the clarity however we have observed some things under low power with some success. The higher power settings are marginal because the light requirement goes up and the optics are just as bad as the low power setting. The tools are cheesy plastic with a ""look of metal"" to them. Still, my daughter likes it and that is what counts - she doesn't have anything to compare it to.For the $35 I paid, I would expect a little bit better of a piece. Maybe I'm expecting too much in remembering the all metal one I had when I was a kid that I wish I still had now."
4,An interesting book...,"Overall, I found the information and stories in this book to be fascinating. The writing style, however, is sometimes a bit confusing and jumbled. Martinez does give excellent references to historical sources such as newspaper articles, and his logic in either supporting or refuting some of the legends regarding Marie Laveau are sound. As a collector of occult books, I found this one to be useful for background and history, as well as full of entertaining folk tales."
3,Good little snapshot of some folklore and mysteries of South,"After finishing my first trip to New Orleans, I was hungry for more information on Marie Laveau and of voodooism. I found this little book in an airport shop and read it on the flight home. Interesting in a short story sort of way."
4,Interesting,"This interesting little book was originally published in 1956 and in it you will find the legend of Marie Laveau, as well as a section on ""chiromancy"" (palmistry) and some folk tales ""from along the Mississippi"" [river].While Marie Laveau (1794-1881), ""Queen of the Voodoos"", was listed as a ""free mulattress"" in the vital statistics of her day; Mr. Martinez offers up other possibilities for her parentage. With his alternating style of ""reporter"" or ""storyteller"", he is careful to point out which ""facts"" are documented, and where they can be found, as well as giving the names and addresses of the long-dead principals.The book is well worth it's modest price, if only to be used as reference to look up the various newspaper articles that were written about this mysterious woman, who's name still carries weight in some New Orleans circles."
4,Schaum's Easy Outline of Logic,"The book IS an outline, and so would not be a choice for primary text in a class. An educator would find the book useful for lecture."
5,One of the greatest books,"I read this book a decade ago and can never forget the greatness of this book that now I am ordering another copy.I cannot agree less with the New York Times review: `It is one of the most remarkable books ever written...Nehru makes even H.G.Wells seem singularly insular...One is awed by the breadth of Nehru's culture'The information is so rich (the history of empires from Greece, Rome and China to name a few), the style is flawless and the English language was written in a most beautiful way that you will forget Nehru was not born next to Shakespeare's Stratford-upon-Avon.I look forward to reading it again and again."
4,Enjoyable read,An enjoyable series with good characters who develop throughout the series and interesting story lines. Provides an insight into the era between world wars and the class system.
1,Dismal film.,"One of the worst films. The acting is a joke. The make-up is plastic. Little narrative sense even given initial assumptions. There are decent comic book films, i.e. Watchman, Batman, Spiderman; but Darkman is among the worst of the genre. Save your money. SCB"
1,Lame,"really lame movie, thought it would be good given all the remakes of other comics but this was just bad."
4,Sam's first superhero movie,"Raimi's first stab at superheroes is better than it has any right to be. His 80's style is in fine form and fits well with a filmic comic book. Like all movies that featured Liam Neeson before he was ""Liam Neeson,"" Darkman gets an actor probably better than this caliber of film deserves. Part of the fun is to watch how Raimi has evolved since Evil Dead. For anyone who doesn't have 80's/90's nostalgia or a fondness for vintage Raimi, feel free to dock the film one star, but I think it's worth seeing on its own merits even without said nostalgia."
3,A very sad film,I always felt like crying when the bad guys messed up that man and left him bitter and disfigured! I can't imagine this story being a comicbook! Seems too dark for a comic book!Then again I haven't read many comics from America except Archie-comics!This movie as far as I'm concerned is about a man's descent into darkness! I don't think this movie is the best but I find the notion of a man's descent into darkness to be an interesting concept! I just felt this movie is lacking on the impact it could have potentially had!
2,Bat- er...Darkman.,"You could easily tell this film was based on a comic book, because this film had very thin plot line, which only serves to create more action. Liam Neeson was actually decent as Darkman, but the script let him down, and some really bad jokes ruined this film. The only real high point is Larry Drake who plays the evil villian Robert G. Durant."
3,"Can you spell ""B"" Movie?","This movie is so bad that it's......OK.Poorly constructed storyline, cheesy acting, cheap effects - this movie has it all. It's a 1950's drive in flick for the 90's."
2,Nothing to write home about,"I bought this movie after reading all the positive reviews. I enjoy high quality HD rendering too. Something of a disappointment I have to say. The movie is ok. Some amusing scenes but fairly predictable throughout. Nowhere near as good as his later works.The picture quality was medium level DVD. DEFINITELY not worth buying on Blu-ray...I can only assume the fulsome reviews came from people either trying to plug the movie, have a poor system set up, or haven't seen any modern efforts to compare it to."
1,I must have been drunk when I bought this one,"Well, what can I say. I KNOW that Liam Neeson can do better work than this, example Schinder's List, but weak plot, weak script, weak movie, get out the Jack Daniel's and call over your buddies if you want to get through this movie. Odds are you will have a better time shooting the breeze with your buddies than watching this."
1,Embarrasing,"What I mostly remember about this film, which I saw in the theatre years ago, was mediocre special effects, and that parts of it were so patently silly that the audience laughed about things that were definitely not meant as jokes."
1,High Hopes,"This movie is not for everyone. Although it has it's artistic imagery through its director Sam Raimi, as a movie the plot seems childish and not realistic. The acting is way over-the-top and there is no emotional pull with any character whatsoever. If you really want to see this movie, I would highly recommend renting it first."
1,banality by any other name,"Jeez, maybe I am getting old, but I really found absolutely nothing about this film to be interesting or original in the slightest.A brilliant scientist. Disfigured. Angry. Finds temporary techie fix for face. Goes to get bad guys. Fighting. More fighting. Still more fighting. Ex mate learns he's alive. He leaves her anyway (he's too ugly). The end. More to come, if successful. Not recommended."
4,My first and favorite Liam Neeson performance,Liam Neeson's voice is beautiful and sad in this movie. And Bruce Campbell is so young and his most beautiful such that the audience collectively sighed when he appeared on the screen. The reputation of this franchise would have been better if both of these actors had been retained for the sequel. This highly wrought movie made me look forward to more from Sam Raimi and the actors.
4,Great Movie But Where Are The Extra Features?,"This is a great movie and I am definately going to buy the remaining Darkman DVD's. The only thing is that there is no extra features such as trailers, commentaries, behind the scenes, etc. I normally do not watch movies more than once but this one I would watch over again."
4,Sam Raimi is king...,"Hot off of ""Evil Dead"" and other successes, director/genius Sam Raimi set out to make a superhero movie: Raimi style! Part Batman, Part Shadow, all cool, ""Darkman"" keeps Raimi's interesting and dark style in tact and help pave the way for this young filmmaker for movies like ""A Simple Plan"" and ""Spider-Man."" Liam Neeson plays a scientist whose life is all but destroyed in a fire set by some evil gangsters. Now, he roams the streets seeking revenge on those who have scarred him. Evil Dead fans should relish the cool camera work and stylized violence that Raimi lays out here. While the action feels a tad toned-down, it's still brutal and awesome. Hail to the King, baby, for he is Raimi!"
4,VERY DARK!!!,"I have always loved those deep dark movies such as the crow, The matrix, blade, dracula and dark city. Darkman is definitely one of those movies. Every now and then cool movies like this one come along and make you think about something other than reality. Unfortunatly the movie probably did not have a big budget so some of the effects look kinda cheap, but that doesn't matter when the rest of the movie is so entertaining. Enjoy!"
2,wildly unentertaining,"Sam Raimi directed Darkman, so you would expect a lot of fun out of the guy who directed the Evil Dead movies. (He made Darkman before Army of Darkness) But I never laughed during this movie. If I did I forgot but there wasn't much to make me like this film. Liam Neeson seems to be the film's saving grace. He's an amazing actor that can play any role, although I prefer him in roles like the ones he did in Schindler's List and Michael Collins and Les Miserables. For a truly fun action film I recommend Army of Darkness."
4,snoopy133704,Darkman is one of the best Dark comicbook adaptations ever done. Sam Raimi directing Liam Neeson and a excellent cast in what I call a movie that i never tire of seeing( and i've seen it at least 40 to 50 times!!! 10 when it was in a regular theatre!!!!!!!) Good transfer to DVD. I would've given it five stars if it would've had DTS or Dolby 5.1 and more extras!! Hope Universal does a 10th Anniversary ED. in 2005! If you love Action in the Batman or comic book Genre this is it!!!!
1,Not worth watching,"This video almost put me to sleep, but only because it was extremely boring. I expected something more than just some calming talk. We watched it once, and I don't see using it again."
5,A most unique piano style with an easy-listening-to sound.,This Lorie Line album is the first of several that I plan on purchasing by this artist. I find her music not only spiritually uplifting but soothing and pleasant to listen to. I highly recommend this album.
2,This is it!,"I can't believe my eyes. Why did you do it? After such a great start in ""Fire Dancer""?!? I don't get it. Yes the chemistry is still there, yes it was great to read more about Reba and Kirtn, but who is this, this BOZO! I hated him, the caracter was a spineless, little fool with a toothy smile so sweet that it's rotting! I'm sorry the story line with that guy, just didn't cut it for me."
2,Non-stick coating does not stick very well!,"I've been looking for a good grid to use on my grill to cook vegetables. I was hoping this might be the one, but it was not. The non-stick surface is nice and definitely aided in preventing the veggies from sticking. The problem was that the non-stick coating started peeling off after the first use! Also this product has flat sides so small veggies tend to roll right off and into the fire. I ended up returning the product as it appeared to be defective."
1,rv,"I bought it as recommended to be used with my other purchase ,Sony E-Reader PRS 505 , but actually it is incompatible with it. Lost of time , money and supplier's credibility."
2,Sony E-Book Charging Cradle,"Unfortunately, Sony and/or Amazon was unclear as to which cradle goes with which e-book version. Current models use a USB-B connector to charge and transfer data. There is no cradle for that model. This cradle fits an older wide serial data/charging port style. It would be nice if a DC power supply(wall-wart) came with it. This doesn't even come with a USB cable."
5,Now is the time to know your Montaigne!,"Reading the history of this innovator in writing--which means ""A Trial"" presentation from the writer to the reader presents an inside history of this remarkable man. When we think of ""Essays"" today, it is fortunate to be able to read a biography of the creator of this writing form."
2,Misogyny 101,"After reading some of the other reviews, I thought this would be a good book for ""the library"". Others wrote they have more than one copy, always keep it around, etc. I thought: ""this will make a nice addition to my collection of beloved non-fiction"". What was I thinking? If you want to be entertained by how unenlightened this guy was, get it...pick a story, any story, and you'll learn that he was an unabashed woman hater. Hard to believe anyone would want to keep several copies of this around. I posthumously pity the women he encountered during his life. How do modern men get through these parts of the book without throwing it across the room in disgust? Hmmmm...I'm giving it 2 stars for sucking me in long enough to be ashamed for the lousy bastard."
5,Architecture and Foodies dream guidebook,"I just came back from an architectural conference in Charleston and over half of the attendees had this guide in their back pocket. This is really the only quidebook one needs for a visit to Charleston - and even for newcomers as it is full of history and gets you up to speed on the local issues. Written by passionate preservationists and serious epicures, this book gets to the heart of the matter quickly and puts you right into the Charleston scene with short walking tours and easy to read maps. This is the third and updated edition and is right up to date with easy to locate restaurant and hotel information. I take it with me every time I'm in town."
3,Charleston Architecture Guide,"A little too in-depth for the casual tourist - and we really like old homes and gardens ! Probably great for architecture or Charleston history buffs. Also, most (95%) of the houses listed are private and not open to the public."
3,Color photos would make this a better book!,"I really thought this would be a prettier book. The black and white photos don't do this book any favors. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of black and white photography, but it's not what is needed for this guide.Other than that,I can't wait to get started on all the suggested walking tours!"
2,Eh.,"I am an architect, and when my husband and I decided to vacation in Charleston over the holidays I thought this would be the perfect guide book for us. We love buildings! Unfortunately, the authors have a somewhat snooty (IMO) attitude about the newer architecture in Charleston. As a member of a local Historic Society, I find it to be the same preservationist attitude that old is good and new is bad. I would only recommend this guide for those who are fascinated by old-south architecture and who intend to spend several days walking around photographing the older buildings of Charleston."
1,MD 470 a poor value,"I bought the MD 470 and 3 MD 40 extension phones. They have been returned. The sound quality is poor. The hands free volume is weak and unusable. The telephone book memory is awkward to access. The tech support is non-existent. It's off shore and they ""have not a clue"" as to this product. Save your money, don't buy"
1,Mine worked well for a while...,"I have had these phones for almost two years now. I really liked looking at and using these phones, they're pretty and well-designed. I did not have the volume problems, and the battery life wasn't an issue once I replaced the batteries. (grumble...)But now the screens are getting dead horizontal lines and the keys are becoming non-functional. I've cleaned the keypads on my phones a few times, but they get dirty about once a month now, so I must give up.I wish Motorola would get it's act together with it's consumer products."
3,Spreading The Word,"It's more like a 3.8 out of 5. Overall I like this phone. Pros are ring tones, fast charge, ease of number storage, and speaker phone located on actual phone as well as base. Cons, batterey life is very short - about 45 minutes of talk time and it needs to recharge. Phone volume could stand some improvement (needs to go a little louder) and getting the phone to go from speaker to just the handset needs a little practice. Lost a few calls trying to turn off the speaker."
1,"you can buy mine on e-bay, if I don't throw it out first.","There are plenty of annoying features with this phone -- battery life is poor, menus confusing, etc. but my biggest complaint is reliability. I have TWO of them, and ""menu"" buttons are starting to breakdown on both, battery life pathetic on both, and both have poor call quality. Although there is a place to plug in the headset, after a month or so, the headsets wouldn't work in this phone. (the headsets themselves work fine in other phones)."
3,These folders are NOT like the picture that was posted!!!,"The picture online, shows that there is a tab connecting the two inside flaps.... This was the MAIN reason I purchased these folders! When I opened the box, the folders were NOT as they are pictured online! If I had known they were like this, I would NOT have purchased them! I will keep them, because I needed new folders for my choir... I had been looking for some time now to find folders with that tab connecting the two flaps... Maybe they don't make them like this anymore... I had bought this type of folder several years ago."
5,Excellent Anthology,"Most of the anthologies I've read in the genre of Fantasy/Scifi and horror are mixed bags of personal likes and dislikes of the editors...some of which are a bit too gory, too 'realistic' or just have what I'd like to call 'fantasy around the edges'. This series is really 'the best'...not the usual commercially bland mixes (see, Bob Silverberg's Legends), but a good mix of quirky, new authors as well as some well known names (Gene Wolfe, Tanith Lee) with a nice blend of both light hearted and serious fantastic tales. Standouts would be: Gene Wolfe's From the Cradle, Naomi Kritzer's Comrade Grandmother, and Michael Swanwick's Five British Dinosaurs."
5,The Coolies,"I love these guys! ""Dig"" was a great album of Simon and Garfunkel covers. I played the album till the grooves were worn out! ""Doug"",their ""rock opera"" had some fantastic tunes on it. Very reminiscent of The Who's ""Tommy"" musically. The rise and fall of ""a skinhead who became a culinary giant"". Priceless stuff!"
2,Cartman Costume,I would not recommend this product to anyone. The jacket and gloves were fine but the head was terrible. It would not stand up. It was just a saggy piece of material. The maker of the costume should have filled out the head a little so that it would actually look like it does in the picture.
2,too much technical info.,"i am glad i read this book, but i am also very glad i am finished reading it. it had some funny and interesting stories of sea life. but it also had a lot of technical jargon in it, which greatly decreased my potential enjoyment of the book. i love the sea, but i do not sail. therefore, i have no idea, for example, what ""scuppers"" are. the book was riddled with terms like that, and it made the book rough sailing (pun intended) for a ""land lubber"" like myself. if you know sailing (or are an obsessed duran fan, like i am), buy this. otherwise, don't bother -- unless you want to spend your nose in a dictionary, and much of your time scratching your head in confusion."
4,Review of Don't Cry Johnny,I enjoyed this story very much. DCJ is very emotion provoking story and I feel most people can relate to the thoughts and experiences of the characters - especially within today's economy situation. Mr. Schotts' writing style is very poetic and flows easily and freely from line to line and page to page.I really wished that this book was longer because the characters were so interesting.
4,An outstanding third offering. . .,". . .in E. Michael Jones' frontal assult on modernism!In ""Degenerate Moderns"", Jones reveals how much of modern society was brought about by persons whose personal lives (and beliefs) could best be described as deviant. In ""Dionysos Rising"", he addresses certain trends in music which somewhat less success. In this volume, he takes on Walter Gropius and the Balhaus School of Design. The style is quite different from the previous two books and reads almost like a novel. In the book we learn how Gropius' own beliefs about sex, family, and religion (and his, shall we say, deviancies in these areas of life) influenced his architectural work.A devastating critique of the International school of architecture in general, and Walter Gropius' work in particular."
3,"Good look, but low quality","I am not terribly satisfied with this scale. While it looks good, it has a few quality issues that are not what I expected from the brand.Pros:* Stylish look* High accuracyCons:* Non-standard batteries will cost you to replace* ""Stainless"" steel top has started to peel away from pastic and show signs of rust?Overall, this is a mediocre product. It will look good for a while but will not be the last kitchen scale you need to buy. That being said, it still measures just fine (although it is not a pretty as it once was). I expected more from Salter."
3,Eileen Yin Fei Lo recipes,"I resisted the urge to get a food scale for baked recipes but I had to get this for Eileen Yin Fei Lo's latest cookbook.Despite its metallic techy appearance, this is very lightweight and easily stores on its side like a book."
1,skale,"Still not sure if I am going to keep it. Reasons: too small, cannot figure it out without reading the instructions. Not good."
3,Good scale with some caveats,"I bought this for the simple design, ability to store upright to save counter space, and the ease of switching between oz. and grams with a button on the front (unlike the Soehlne that was rated best by Cooks Illustrated). That said, the scale is so small that it's sometimes difficult to read the display. Also, it's not terribly accurate. If you want to test it, try weighing 10 quarters. They should total 2 oz. Mine read 1 3/4 oz. If you need super precision, this is not for you. I especially like the conversion between grams and oz. I use a lot of international recipes that use the metric system."
2,Great,"I had purchased this item many years ago. When new batteries would not revive it, I wanted the same scale because it had been excellent. When I received this one, I was initially pleased, however after several days it stopped working. When I inserted NEW batteries, it was fine.Seems strange that a new product was shipped with old or defective batteries."
3,Okay if you are not from New England,Just was not for me... I like a good strong brew and this did not provide that. Using more just made it gross. It's not bad ... just not up to my preference in flavor.
5,As good as I was hoping it would be,"Just as I was thinking about some iced coffee, the UPS guy shows up with my Cool Brew order. It was nicely packed with an insulated liner. I immediately opened it for a cup. Despite comments I read about the original flavor being bland or not very strong, I found it to be full of flavor and just what I was hoping it would taste like. I love coffee but don't drink hot things in the summer and don't have time to run to a coffee shop or McDonald's for a cup of iced coffee throughout the day. Judging from how big this 32 ounce bottle (1 liter) is, I'll be making myself many cups of iced coffee before I need to order again. And it's so fast! Pour a measured amount (measured area provided on the bottle) into a cup, add milk (my preference) and sweetener, ice and a straw and call it done. I'm much impressed.Cool Brew Fresh Coffee Concentrate - Original 32 oz - Make Iced Coffee or Hot Coffee - Enough for 32 beverages"
2,Didn't work,The on off switch was not working when we received the digital imaging binoculars.We returned them.
2,Sticky and Stiff - NOT SOFT,"This product leaves my hair sticky and stiff. Once I blow dry it the stiffness is less, but there is no softness to my hair. In fact, it doesn't really prevent frizz all that well. You will need a separate detangler because it makes your hair next to impossible to comb through if you spray it on and don't blow dry it right away. Just buy something else. For reference, I have straight, thin hair."
5,Cécile Ousset at the peak of her technical and artistic abilities,"What a fascinating recording!Cécile Ousset not only has a breathtaking technique at her disposal but also shows a highly intelligent overview of the entire musical piece she is interpreting and a distinct notion of it. In every part of the concerto's she seems to be aware of the totality of that concerto and, by that, passes it on to the listener: very illuminating and inspiring.Fine choice to include the second piano-concerto of Saint Sans, it is worth more frequent performance."
4,Great music for all time.,"I have all three of these albums. I like volume 1 the best. I wish that they would come out with volume 4 or 5. If you like this stuff you might want to consider: ""Hollywood's Greatest Hits"" by Erich Kunzel and the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra. This is excellent music. I even use it in my classroom."
4,Eye Candy,Amazing effects and eye candy for a film of this vintage.Why not 5 stars?...the acting is pretty bad here though I am not sure it is suppose to be particularly good...regardless it is a must see film for anyone who likes Fantasy films.
3,"Cheesy, but stunning special effects for the time","To me, this movie's strength is its special effects, circa 1940: kudos to the filmmakers! I am a filmmaker and I work in Final Cut Pro, and frankly, even now, in 2011, I wouldn't know how to accomplish any of the things they pulled off 71 years ago. They really did a great job.But. . .overall, with only a few exceptions, I found the story cheesy, the romance silly and wooden, the acting overdone, and many of the scenes repetitive to the point of dull. I could see how the film wowed people decades ago, but it didn't work as a modern film."
4,The 1924 Version with Douglas Fairbanks is the Original,This is a remake of the 1924 silent version starring Douglas Fairbanks.The 1924 version is more spectacular.
5,Full of Eastern Delight,"I found this movie recommended on Roger Ebert's site.Considering this was made in 1940, the effects are amazing with towering genies flying horses and flying carpets, and a special world filled with vibrant colors, amazing storytelling, and sparkling dialogue.According to Ebert his 7 year old grandchild loved it, so it has a classic timeless quality about it.The version I saw also featured commentaries with both Martin Scorsese and Francis Coppola, who were both inspired by this movie as children, and it would appear that this is a favorite among well known directors.Their affection for this movie and its history is quite obvious.I totally enjoyed it not only for its beauty, but for its story, and the way it grips you, and its surprising twists and turns. Loved the genie. You could easily imagine a child being quite talellthis movie.I hope you find this review helpful, and I think you will find the Thief of Bagdad enjoyable."
5,Excellent,This was and is supurb. Excellent qualty print too. I do recommend this to young and old alike. My whole family enjoyed it.
4,Note to parents on violence in this film with spoilers!,"Although a popular fantasy, films from this era had a different code system to follow. Parents might want to be aware that two of the bad guys are felled by the hero with arrows from a crossbow directly in the forehead, which may shock some. An old ruler is held by a lifesize mechanical doll and stabbed in the back. Abu fights a giant spider and hacks off a limb before cutting the thread that sends it into the pit below where an octopus awaits. If your kids can handle the live action Lord of The Rings, then they can handle this as well."
5,A masterpiece to been seen by all generations,"""The Thief of Baghdad"" is a masterpiece and should be seen by the present and future generations. It is a movie complete and all its aspects. I was 10 when I first saw ""The Thief of Baghdad"" and since then I could never forget the moments of enchantment it brought to me everytime (more than 10 times)I went to the movies to see it on the big screen. It was and still is my fantasy favorite movie. In the Middle 60's I finally found a copy in 16mm at a distributor and had to rent a projector to show the film at home. Although the copy was in very bad conditions I could even so, be able to go back to the days of my childhood while enjoying this wondereful film.Recently I púrchased a VHS copy at Amazon[.com] and virtually ""obliged"" my 18 year-old daughter to watch it. It was a prize to have the film with me at all times. The new edition in DVD is perfect and reveals all the splendor the film brings."
4,Abu: No court position for me! I want to have some fun!,"Wonderful story. Wonderful spectacle. However, the sound is horrible. Couldn't they have restored it better?"
5,"thief of bagdad,dvd",This is my favorite movie of my entire life from early childhood. I've been searching for the DVD for years. Thank Amazon.com for getting a hold of it. I bought one for my son as well. Its his favorite movie too. We had an old VHS tape but time marches on doesn't it? I was stunned at how quickly it came to my house and I didn't even go for the super fast delivery.I love Amazon.com. Keep up the great work
4,"Nice book, but...","This is a nice book, with lots of interesting tidbits and information, nice illustrations and presentation, some good biography on Lewis Carroll, but if you're expecting to have every symbol and allusion explained, you won't find it here."
5,What a wonderful book!,"A friend made reference to enjoying this book in passing, and since I love collecting classic literature and Burton's adaptation of the movie was coming out, I decided to buy it. I have been raving about Martin Gardner ever since it arrived! I love his notes interspersed throughout the book. He's the Victorian era whisperer or something. He essentially unlocks all of these lines and details in the illustrations that most modern Americans would overlook. He makes Carroll's brilliance with word play really shine through. And I love when errors in the original illustrations are pointed out. This book is a gem--definitely in my top 5 of all time. In fact, if I had to choose one work of fiction to go to a desert island with, this would be it! I'm going to be buying more of Gardner's works to add to my collection."
5,A book for the fans,"This book is great because it includes both books Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found there. I liked the second book more than the first because in my opinion it had more meaning. Anyone who is a fan of Alice would value this great book. The illustrations are awesome, it has a few but great quality."
4,we are all mad here...,"When I drecided to buy a copy of Lewis Carroll's Alice books, I did not expect this. When I saw this book on the middle shelf of the local cain-bookstore, I had to buy it. When I started to read it, I found myself bypassing the notes just to read the book. But, then again, shouldn't that be the way it's done? Anyway, when I went to the bookstore again I bought a copy of the complete works of Lewis Carrol so that I could read his poetry. When I read it I was shocked. There is a whole other alice book not included in the annotated alice. 'Alice's Adventures Underground' is nowhere to be found. This was strange considering the detail and colletiveness given by Mr. Gardener. You would think this would be included. But it is forgiveable. This is something noone should be without."
5,Fun Fun Fun,Old classics never die and it was a joy to reread this for my book club. This was the selection for November and we all enjoyed rereading it.
5,"What Do You Mean, Nonsense?","This is the ONLY version of the Alice in Wonderland stories worth having. Lewis Carroll was a remarkably allusive chap -- and a mathematician to boot -- so you need a vade mecum to guide yourself through the bulrushes. Martin Gardner serves admirably for this purpose.Without Gardner's help, I would never have known that mock turtle soup was actually made with veal (and that's why John Tenniel drew the Mock Turtle with the head, hind hoofs, and tail of a calf). And now I think I know why a raven is like a writing desk (""because it can produce a few notes, tho they are very flat; and it is never put with the wrong end in front""). Also, now I know the REAL text of the nursery rhyme ""You Are Old, Father William.""This is the best edition to get because -- let's face it -- you WILL read the Alice stories more than once. And very likely others in your household will do the same. The real reason, as the Cheshire Cat says: ""We're all mad here. I'm mad. You're mad."""
5,THIS BOOK ROCKS,This book is one of the best of the spawn books. The other good one being #6. i think everybody should be forced to read this book and we should form a religion based off this book. This book should become our new bible because it is so cool.I believe we should all stop showering in water and we should now shower in this book for it is just that cool. If you read this book you will score with millions of chicks everyday. GO BUY THIS BOOK
2,You need a very fast PC!,"Nearly the half of the examples in this book need a lot of cpu-power to render it. I've got some p-ii 333 mhz with 128mb ram. It has a beautiful sun, but 3mins/pic is to much. All fire Effects use (Particle)Combustion. To less explanations of the parameters. Too much is given by pre-load file."
5,Get this book!!!,If you like special effects this book is the best on the market. The price is incredible for the content New Riders provides!
4,A great book for adding that elusive element of greatness...,"This is different from any 3D book I've ever seen. In most refernce manuals there is a ton of space devoted to dialogue, some useful most not. This is like a cook book, you look up an effect and follow the directions. No paragraphs that go on forever before reaching the useful information. This is a reference set up people who know there way around MAX, no nonsense modeling and animation tips and tricks. A definite must for serious animators..."
3,"This is a good ""idea"" book, it helped me out a lot.","This book is more like a recipe book, if you are looking for a ""how - to"" book, this one is it. I would recommend it for intermediate to advanced Max users and it does have something for everyone. I enjoyed reading it and the excellent pictures. Not too shabby. Well worth the price these guys are selling it for."
4,American Girls Shor Stories,"A terrific set of short stories for young readers. My 8 year old loves the fact that these books are small and fun to read, she enjoyed every single one! I would encourage any reader to get your hands on these, just the right size, especially for bedtime, full of FUN Books."
2,Questionable about being new,"Not a new set and definitely not the ""original"" set of books.Pages are in good condition, but 2 of the books cover w/ ""some type of food"". Looks like some kid handle it after eating their snack.Also one of the book was replaced w/ another title."
1,"average, boring heavy metal","Just because its japanese, doesnt mean its great. This band really brings nothing new to metal, but if you want some headbanging good times without much thought or creativity, here you go. Their other albums are even worse, sprinkled with ballads that remind one of Whitesnake. Only for japanese fanboys and girls or ""old old school metal"" fans, the kind who think black sabbath is still the cutting edge of metal."
3,Buy the CliffsAP book instead,"This book is by no means terrible; however, I found that it's very poorly organized and written. The CliffsAP version is much better, including timelines and bulleted lists to make studying easier.However (and I'm writing this after having recieved my AP scores from 2003's administration), I read straight through the review section of the book and got a 5 on the exam. Take that as you will."
5,Hummingbird magic,"These are THE most favorably commented upon earrings that I own.There's plenty of hummingbird jewelry on the market but most everything I have seen does not capture the quality of hummingbird. These do. Period.Unreserved recommendation.Oh, actually, there IS a downside; every now and then I spontaneously give one away(that I am wearing) to a friend, and have to then re-purchase a pair. This phenomenon happens as fast as a darting hummingbird, so I am now convinced that these earrings are imbued with some kind of self-propagating hummingbird magic."
4,Good shop manual,"I use my copy of this manual all the time -- I find it a hundred percent better and more convenient than the cheap CD versions. As with any modern hi tech vehicle, people expecting the basic shop manual to cover such things as electronic troubleshooting and computer diagnostics will be disappointed. (There is a separate Electrical Troubleshooting Manual). However for complete coverage of general maintenance, engine, body, mechanical and other work this is the one to have. It explains such systems as the air suspension in considerable detail, and tells you how to remove and replace almost any part on the vehicle. While it cannot make you completely independent of the dealer it has tons of diagrams and is very comprehensive. It easily pays for itself the first time you fix something yourself!!"
3,My Dilemma,"The book is well written. I was amazed and freightened at all of the possibilities and the stark truth that was laid out before me.I learned in about a week after reading the book, that I was calling the book outdated even though it was a relatively new book. It was recomended by a urologist. I was glad that I read the book,it gave me many ways that I may decide to solve my dillema, but reading some newer material made me wonder why I was confused and why I read this book to begin with. The book is well presented, but may have done a disservice in my case."
5,Why review in 2007?,"Simple! These almanacs contain so much more information than just the moon/astrological infor for that year. It's packed full of articles for people of many Pagan traditions to enjoy. You also get a taste of many different Llewellyn authors so you can decide who you'd like to read and who you'd rather skip. I keep all of these, and know I always will!"
5,To everyone...do you think it's possible?Help me!,It's a pity...I really would like to read this book in italian
5,gutter bracket,I had a hard time finding equipment locally. It was nice to find someone who had the correct brackets & connectors
3,PR retrospective,"This book has quite a few worthwhile images, but many of the color photos, and most of the shots with ""Rosies"" riveting, etc. are obviously staged, and disappointing inasmuch as they don't really show manufacturing activity."
5,Beautifully done book,"One of the best of it's kind, full of beautiful glossy photos of airplanes and people. Captures the era, with many public relations type photos."
4,A good look at an important topic,"As more and more of our aircraft production is outsourced to foreign locations, it is important to remember the glory days of American aircraft production. The various tables that list production numbers point out just how far the industry came from its weak start at the beginning of the war. The photos of the workers, even the staged ones, help humanize the tremendous effort.I'm a bit disappointed that some major facilities are shown quite frequently while others are largely ignored. For instance, the ""Bell bomber plant"" here in Marietta, which built plenty of B-29s, and is the building that I currently work in, is not even mentioned!"
5,I Wanna Be Like Mike!,"What a great story about commanding a navy warship! This grassroots approach to leading such a diverse population is extraordinary. Someone once told me that the key to success in leading people is to ""remember their name and look them in the eye when they're talking."" Abrashoff proves this and also emphatically drives home the fact that 'the little things count the most.' Bravo-Zulu Mike - This should be considered a textbook for all managers at all levels!"
4,Unique,"Unlike so many other Management books, ""It's Your Ship"" takes a different approach to Management. Instead of the normal book with boring business examples, this one chronicles the command of Abrashoff on a Navy PT ship. Insightful and Unique this book offers many great tips and different was of leadership and business decision making. You will not be dissappointed."
4,Advice is useful at work and outside of work,Good no nonsense advice. If you want the basics of a chapter then read the first story in every section. Rarely do follow-on stories make new points. I have used the information in this book at my job and at home.
4,Good Concepts - Easy to Translate to Non-Military,"I purchased this book and handed it out to students in one of my leadership classes. It provides good insights, examples, and stories about how the Captain was able to gain the trust and respect of the men and women under his charge. Even though the book is about the Navy and there is an obvious hierarchy that must be followed, the lessons learned can easily be translated into non-military and non-government. This book is easy to read and provides excellent lessons in leadership."
4,Good book on leadership,"I'm about 2/3 through this book at this time...it's an easy read, and has some very pragmatic suggestions regarding leadership."
5,Should be required reading for C level senior officers,"I can assure you we would not be in the mess we are in had the CEO's of our financial institutions and our U.S. auto makers read this puppy 10 years ago and acted accordingly. I know the book wasn't written yet but you get my point. Very thouht provoking and a great example of setting he vision and letting the ""crew"" take ownership of it! GREAT READJohn Gregory VincentPresident - Genesis Consulting Group LLCwww.johngvincent.com"
3,message gets butchered by the tone of delivery,"This is a great book to read with a view towards incorporating the themes into any workplace productivity improvement effort. Having said that, the author is not shy with self promotion and aggrandizement. Parts are hard to stomach!"
5,Great book for new or old leaders,I am a lieutenant in one of the largest police departments in the state of South Carolina within the great city of North Charleston. I have applied what I have gotten from this book to my own personal style of leadership. I recommend this book to those that have recently been promoted as well as those who have been supervising for years. I have really enjoyed the book and have read it several times to remind myself of certain aspects of leadership and to pick up those other details that I have missed. Thanks again. Sincerely Brian Adams
5,Everyone is a leader of something.,"I heard Mike Abrashoff speak last fall and found him truly inspirational. I bought his book for all the managers in our company and then had ""book club"" with them to discuss how we could apply the lessons of this book to our organization. The book is not only an easy read, but applicable to a number of different situations. The primary lesson is how to get people to take ownership of their role in an organization and care about its success. I highly recommend the book to managers, Boy Scout leaders, heads of households, team captains, Sunday School teachers, and CEO's."
2,Remedial and self-indulgent,"Nothing new in this book. If you've done any reading on leadership, it's unlikely you're going to get anything from this. I did find it interesting to see how leadership techniques worked in an organization I cannot relate to so it was an interesting read nonetheless. Wholly self-indulgent however, and the author tends to repeat the same points over and over (yes, we get it, the job of a ship's captain is operational readiness - I didn't need to be told that 100 times over).Net: If you're an experienced leader looking for an entertaining read it might be fun. If you're a new leader you'll probably find some things useful in the book."
5,Common sense... not a common book,"As a ten year Navy veteran, I was riveted to this book for it's common sense approach to leadership. There are many books available today about management but damn few that focus on great leadership. That's where this book's niche is. It's a quick and very interesting read. As I was going through the book I kept thinking ""why don't more leaders act this way""? The answer, unfortunately, is that to be a great leader you must set your course and then get out of your own troops way.I loved the book and highly recommend it to anyone who wants a quick course in leadership."
5,The best damn audiobook in awhile,Wow... what a great audio book ill start off with the sound I needed no adjustment on my EQ and the narration was by the author and it was great it kept me intrigued and made me laugh. The book had a lot of great management techniques mostly designed around boosting employee moral and would be helpful to anyone that is in a leadership position.The audio book was quite short but it got out the information it needed and didn't drag or repeat it's message this was a cool change in the books I've been listening to and it was like a breath of fresh air id recommend this book to anyone as a great quick read or listen.
3,"The ""I, I"" Captain","This book is a worthy addition to the ""common sense list of management principles backed by personal anecdotes"" genre. If you are a new manager or, like most managers, need to be ocassionally reminded of basics like ""Keep your priorities in focus"" or ""Don't work harder, work smarter"" this is an entertaining book and fairly fast read. But it is also self-centered. The best authors of these books (and best managers, I think) are able to write about what they did without talking about themselves. Harvey Mackay, for instance, has this down to a science. Abrashoff can't help himself. The words, 'me', 'myself', and 'I' appear 48 times on page 27 alone. The title may be, ""It's Your Ship"", but the book screams ""It's MY Ship."""
4,Good Stuff,"I learned some pratical things that could be implemented immediately to motivate and encourage employee ""ownership"" of processes and products."
4,Old Dog needs change agents,This book is a great example of how a management style focused on improvement can begin to change a large organization. The fact that the author was the Secretary of the Navy's administrative assistant certianly gives him a leg up on bringing change to the Navy. The author also has the ability to inspire his crew to produce ideas that work. It made me wonder how many good ideas are out there not being put to work. I recommend this book to anyone looking to improve an organization.
4,"Intuitive, but thought provoking","Captain Abrashoff's dire need to correct the climate aboard his command was a self preserving move that needed to happen. I'm glad he had those opportunities in his earlier career to get the experience he did in order to open his mind to other methods of improvement..no more of ""the beatings will continue until morale improves.""As a military officer myself, I'm often amazed by the hidden talents of the enlisted ranks... I often find that of a hundred things to do, 99 can better done by someone other than me."
4,Surprising how well Abrashoff was able to apply good people skills in his setting,"Nothing new about the principles outlined by the author, but it is remarkable that he was able to apply them a military setting. This was a quick, easy read. I enjoyed it and found many applications for my leadership role. Great example of how a leader can make a huge impact on their subordinates."
3,It's okay,It's distracting and entertaining but too many anecdotes pile on and it's hard to finish the book and I failed to see what is really new.
3,Eh,"This book is okay. It takes about 3 hours to read, so it's easy to get through. We purchased it for a group of supervisors at work. I was surprised that there wasn't more detail in the book with actual ""how to"" tips. It was unrealistic and undetailed."
4,Yet another management book,"Yet another book on management-this time a naval perspective! Despite the criticism of such books in the research article by Dr Peter Teiman,""The many varieties of management"",I have to admit that this book has a lot of practical value.Dr Peter TeimanSwitzerland"
5,It All Makes Perfect Sense,"Michael Abrashoff tells an inspiring story loaded with credibility, loyalty, mutual respect between teams, commitment & professionalism. And my favourite - passion. A passion for doing things right, and doing the right things - by your people and your employer.Throw in powerful high tech equipment and life & death decision-making in a context of urgency and impact which most of us will never experience, and you have the story of a real-life American hero.Well done Michael Abrashoff. This book is your gift to the nation!"
5,It's more than just the military,"This book has insightful meaning for other than just military leadership. Its principles are applicable, in particular, to school site administrators. Besides the military, what other group of leaders deals with such a massive beauracracy? It is a thoughtful book about leadership that everyone who holds or aspires to a management role should read.Captain Abrashoff captures the ideals of a good leader and demonstrates how you can bring them to reality, even under difficult circumstances. It is most inspirational."
1,3 words rating,""" I DONT KNOW"", how to rate this book because i have not received it. I was told that i would receive this product between 16 AUG and 29 AUG. it is now SEPT 1ST and still no product."
1,Egotistical,"Nothing like a book to praise how well you've done, and how everyone should aim to be more like you!"
1,I Expected Substance,"I anticipated an insightful book on leadership and was surprised to find only simple platitudes. More surprising were the number of personal pronouns throughout the book - I've never before read a management technique & leadership book that focused so much on the individual. In contrast, Jim Collins' book ""Good to Great"" describes level 1 through 5 leaders. Let the reader decide for himself/herself what level is CAPT Abrashoff."
1,Ordered New but got Used book.,"As the title states. I ordered and paid for a new book, however when it arrived it was worn with a store added bar-code that stated ""Used very good"". Too bad they didn't send the back extra money with my order. I'm sure the book will be great. Go Navy!"
3,Narrowly focused,This book is one destroyer captains command and how he describes how he did things right. Somewhat biased and self serving but has some interesting leadership tips and examples. Little or no history of ship operations.
5,Great book for leadership!,"This book was referred to me by one of the strongest and best leaders in the fire service. The authors point of looking out for the people you lead, that then allows them to rise to their potential and ""look out for you""! Showing respect and support of those you lead affirms them to make decisions at their level, take ownership over that, and excel. Also, leading and challenging what has ""always been"" in order to improve, change and become more effecient at whatever your task or operation is. This is a must read for any leader, whether leading from the bottom or top of your organization!"
5,Comments from a former Marine and current academic,"I just read Abrashoff's ""It's Your Ship"" and strongly recommend the book to managers at all levels and academics that teach Management, Organizational Behavior and Leadership. The author, Captain D. Michael Abrashoff - former commander of the USS Benfold, write in an engaging, easy to read style. The information he conveys is priceless. If you are concerned about productivity, profitability and opportunities for growth, the book is a handbook for success.Having spent many years in the ""old Corps (USMC)"", heavy industry and higher education, I, too, have come to reject the old fashioned and dysfunctional command and control approach to leadership. There is a much better model and it is well described and richly illustrated in this book."
5,It's Your Ship,"WOW!! From the moment I started reading this book I found it a compelling read. Have already go a line up from other students and friends to read the book. If there is one book that you read this year on leadership you have to purchase this one. There are serious gems on nearly every page. As I am not what is called a fast reader. This book is the fastest I have read and couldn't put it down. A very easy read.Have already started reading his next book It's our Ship. Don't waste any more time. Buy in now, guarantee you won't put it down once you start."
4,Great Book,Easy read.... met author at conference and got a free copy - bought this one as a gift. Great business and life principles.
4,excellent for all new managers,"Very empowering for any manager, but a lot of great concepts and ideas for new managers who are open to developing their people."
3,audio was not good,doesnt matter how good the preformance is if the audio is crap and this audio was not very good. i realize its old but come on guys
5,43 incredible projects to build for Boy Scout Troops,"A great book on Boy Scout pioneering projects and ideas from Gilwell Park in England. Written by John Thurman, is is a sequel of sorts to ""Scout Pioneering"" by John Sweet. Contains care of materials, tools, supplies, and safety. Proper use of spars, ropes, knots, block and tackle. Projects include, towers, gates, water toys, rafts, derricks, camp furnishings, and so much more. Some of these ideas are good for camps, farms and ranches as well, and those interested in bushcraft and survival. Has diagrams, illustrations and text to follow. The book is from the 1950's or prior, and was reprinted in 1993 in a red softcover with a black spiralbound cover. The interior pages are copies from the original. I highly recommend this as well as Scout Pioneering to scout leaders and others interested in building these projects."
2,sculpting fairies in polymer clay,"I was disapointed, the pictures in the directions are hard to see and follow, because they are in black and white instead of color.I can't follow your review guidelines for this review as when I try to use it,it states there isn't one."
1,huge disappointment,"for the money this book cost, I expected a good book on making fairies in polymer clay. It was a huge disappointment in every way.......poor quality, bad pictures, not very well thought out or put together. I wish I had read the other reviews before purchasing the book. Lesson learned."
2,a new method,I was not impressed. The methods used in this book are way more difficult. Sculpting and then cutting it open to put the armature in seems a little silly to me. It is not a book to use for beginners and a practiced sculpter would find it very primative. There are a lot better books out there.
2,Disappointing!,"This book was a disappointment. Most of it is in black & white, and the colors pictures that were in the book were of poor quality."
3,Very Poor Photo Quality,"I just received this book in the mail, and although I haven't sat down and read through it, I must say that although there are a few color photos (of finished product only), all the instruction photos are in black and white and they are poor quality, some photos in took me a minute to even see what it was showing. I was very disappointed in this book because of that. My low rating is for the picture quality only, if you follow instruction by sight and not my reading, don't get this book."
5,fae love,"The book was wonderful,and I love fairies so this was a good jump start for me to start my fairie sculpting."
4,order the songs individually,If you order the whole MP3 they want to charge you $9.99 but if you order the six selections individually it's $5.94. so go figure.
5,Provides extended solid firm lift,"Being 63 years old and not having E.D. to my knowledge, my performance would dwindle in about 20 minutes with little chance of come back. Having tried Super X on two occassions (one pill only, that's all I need)within 3 hours of taking with food, Johnson is solid and firm for upto 1 1/2 to 2 hours. I can certainly go the extended distance now to provide complete satisfaction for my wife. Surprisingly, within 1/2 hour of climax, Johnson was solid and firm again to provide about an additional 1/2 hour of rock hard pleasure. Everyone is different, but all I can say is Super X certainly provides me the needed firmness that I was lacking!"
1,Not As Advertised,"I bought this product because it said it contained Tongkat Ali, Cistanche Deserticola, Epimedium Brevicornum Maxim, Panax ginseng, but when I received I found it had Cordyceps Sinensis, Epimedium Brevicornum, Panax Ginseng which is a totally different product. This product don't work like the one containing Tonkat Ali."
4,Nokie Edwards/1999 Plugged & Unplugged,"This 1999 release by Nokie Edwards, the original Ventures' lead guitarist, consists of 12 tracks: six with electric lead guitar and six with acoustic guitar. Contrary to the statement in the previous review, none of the tracks are live recordings (no live audience was present).The first six tracks are Aquarius, Mr. Moto, House of the Rising Sun, San Antonio Rose, Keep Searchin' (a Del Shannon tune), and Slaughter on 10th Avenue. The six acoustic tracks are a Nokie original(Surf Rider), Blue Star, Manchurian Beat, Diamond Head, Can't Help Falling in Love, and Caravan.Several of the tracks have never been released by Nokie before and are therefore new to fans. Some are newly recorded versions of tunes that the Ventures have released previously. If you are a Ventures fan or just enjoy listening to fabulous and melodic rock guitar music, this CD is for you. Nokie is a masterful player and has served as an inspiration to many."
5,Obviously!,"Yeah, best speakers ever owned. I have had them for 3 months with no problems. I have a really good idea though. Instead of using all four channels for the computer only, I hooked up the rear channels to my clock radio. Its really easy, it has separate input cables for the front and rear. Using monster wire made it about 10% clearer. Very deep bass that hits very well for a 8"" sub, you would swear it is a 12. Simple, easy, just hook it up and go. I used some turtle wax rubber restorer to shine up the rubber surrounds on the sub and satellites. Don't get it on the cones though. I was thinking of replacing the 8"" sub with a rockford fosgate but really its pretty good. Don't waste your money on a really expensive system when this is more than you will ever need...."
5,The are GREAT!,"I just got these Speakers off of a site, and once i turned these babies on, i was in Bliss. All the people who said they blew them up the first day, WOW. They must not no sound systems, you never jack up the sub. Only turn it up it enough so you can hear it, but no find the sub blindly. Sub over 50% = bad news. Well everything rocks about them, so im happy!"
1,Main plug always wears out,"This speaker system and every other Logitech speaker system I've bought - the main plug that goes into the subwoofer always goes bad. There are too many pins and eventually one or more does not make good contact. It is nearly impossible to repair. While these speakers sound good, they always ed up in the garbage thus many landfills must be overflowing with these things. I've learned my lesson the hard way."
4,Better than the Bose sound system,"Wow! This sound system is excellent! I use to be an Altec Lansing fan until I got the Logitech Z-640 sound system. That sound system was great but I had to upgrade. So I got this one.Wow again! The subwoofer is 188watts of pure fun (not for the neighborhood) and the speakers are 53watts of clear sound. This is better than the bose sound system mainly because it produces the same sound but doesn't cost $2000.00 No, just divide that by a 10 and you'll get your price!This is also THX certified. In other words it is approved for movie blasting! HAHAHA!!! Get your sound system TODAY!!! Don't look around any longer. The only sound system better than this is the Z-680 5.1 THX certified sound system! (comes with extra speaker, wireless remote control, and something else) But it costs $399 on logitech.com So if you get it. Buy it from amazon.I could go on and on about this system but I can't. (I'm limited to 1,000 words)"
3,beware of hardware failure,"The sound quality of these speakers is excellent and price wise they're a steal compared with the Klipsch promedias. HOWEVER keep all sales records because there are definite hardware issues with this model. (I never thought it would happen to me.) After 2 yrs of regular use, my rear output suddenly no longer works. The rear satellites work fine when hooked up to the front output, so it's something wrong internally. After going to the Logitech forms on-line, this appears to be a common problem..."
1,Falls short of expectations,I thought it was pretty decent until I owned for 12 days short of year and the unit just shut off and died while I was playing a video game. Now I have to deal with shipping it back to the manufacturer and waiting an indefinite amount of time for them to ship it back. YES!I should have:A. Bought something else entirely.ORB. Paid the extra money for a product replacement plan knowing this wasn't going to be reliable.LEARN FROM MY MISTAKE.
4,Wowzers,This is by far the best investment that i have made on my computer system. The speakers are AMAZING. I am a audiophile big time so I know when I here quality. The satalites are very very clean and SO LOUD. I just got them today and i already have a headache. A MUST BUY!!!!!!!!!!
4,Logitech Z560 4.1 Computer speakers,"The first set I received had a sub-woofer that was not wired correctly. This was just before Xmas. Amazon indicated this set was received by them directly from Logitech. I then e-mailed Logitech, which suggested an answer in 24 hrs. (I never received one).Amazon customer service was fantastic. They sent me out a new system promptly with an immediate pickup for the set which was defective.This set- Z560 is amazing, I absolutely love the sound and the pod fits right on the stand of my FP1800 flat screen.I currently added the Sennheiser RH85 Cordless headset and it isso convenient to plug it into the control/volume pod."
4,Great for bass lovers,"i am *not* a gamer, i like listening to music, and i found that the original location i had the setup in (about 12'x12')was too bassy even with the bass turned down to 'zero'. if i could turn down the base some more, i would rate this a 5.the new location is a much larger space, and the sub is far away (~12 feet) from the other speakers (it's an L-shaped room). this setup sounds *really* good.all in all, i am very happy with them now.the speakers were also really easy to mount onto walls: very well designed.i recommend these very highly for gamers and people who like bass."
2,"One Year, Two Blown Subwoofers","The sound from these speakers is great, but the subwoofer is prone to blow, even at moderate volumes if sustained over a few hours. I normally don't review products, but after seeing all the outstanding reviews of this speaker system I thought its important for buyers to know its drawbacks. I blew the subwoofer in a week. Then I blew it again 11 months later. Great sound, I guess, but don't push this system at all."
5,Love this Book!,"Just bought this to have on hand when my granddaughter visits. Had one years ago for my (now)13yr old. She was 2 at the time and we had to read it every night. I had it memorized for years, her older sister still does. In fact, she's the one who has that copy now and is reading it to her daughter. This might be the best kids book ever! Forgot to mention... if you're not buying this particular copy make sure the one you get is the full version. There are shortend ones available (board versions particularly) that are not nearly as entertaining."
5,Best show Ive seen in a long time.,I started to watch this show about 3 days ago and loved it so much that I watched the entire season 1 and season 2 in the last 3 days.I am amazed at how many times true sci-fi shows such as this get canned. I am atleast thankful that the writers were able to write something that gave a finally to the show. So many times I have seen good sci-fi shows end a season and be cancelled leaving the show up in the air.Thank you to all the writers and the cast for creating this amazing show. It is a shame that there is no channel dedicated to sci-fi what will commit to true science fiction as opposed to channels that call themselves sci-fi and then show programs like wrestling or treasure hunting programs and the like.If you like sci-fi this program is a must watch.
5,Better than season 1,"If you are a joss whedon, sci fi, buffy, and or angel fan, you might like dollhouse.The show in its entirety, especially the epitaph episodes, is pretty good. If you are a fan of buffy and angel, you will notice some of the same actors interacting as completely different characters, which is entertaining.Dollhouse deals with the issues that arise once technology makes it possible for human minds/identities could be saved, deleted, and tranferred interchangeably with other humans. The interesting themes, detailed set, and outstanding performances by some of the supporting cast makes the show worthwhile."
3,Not high on my recommendation list,"I really like Joss Whedon usually, this is an exception. The premise has a huge amount of promise but the characters are unlikeable. The inconsistencies in characters and the plot make it mediocre at best. I really just find it hard to connect with a show that has no one that I can relate to. Check out Buffy, now that's a good show."
5,Season 2 will be bought by me,"Because of Fox's stupidity, the final episode of season one wasn't even aired in the US. But I bought the full season here and had time to view that episode before the series finale. Anyone who has loved this show should watch that.Anyway, as soon as season 2 comes out on DVD I will buy that too. I'm just sorry that FOX will probably reap the profits from it... Whedon is a genius and I have loved every show he has created."
3,Haven't gotten to see this season yet,"I haven' gotten to see the 2nd season on the DVD yet, but I remember the show as being quite good and I love what Josh Weedon does with his characters and the plot twists. I am sure that I will like it as much as I have the first season DVD that I have, but I am being a bit reserved about it right now."
4,Dollhouse Season 2,"I thoroughly enjoyed the season 2 DVD for Dollhouse. I purchased a used DVD that was suppose to be like new, I believe. The DVD had a few issues playing at times. It was not bad enough to try to return the dvd, but it was an annoyance at times. The series was great and I wish they would have kept making it. Too bad it is off the air. Now I want to see Tru Calling."
4,Race to the end,"Series two largely abandons Series one's reliance on standalone episodes and instead accelerates the main plot. The series creators obviously knew that the writing was on the wall, because it races at a breakneck pace to wrap up before it hits the end.It does feel rushed at times, but the story is good enough that you won't mind too much. And at least, unlike Firefly, this series had a proper ending."
5,Amazing!,"Such a beautiful episode, extraordinary way to conclude the show. One of the best finales I've ever seen. I wasn't sure about watching the Epitaphs, but they were amazing and surprisingly emotional. The only thing I would say is that it's better to watch both Epitaph 1&2 at the end of season 2 instead of seperately."
5,Barbie's not the only one...,"Apparently Echo's not the only one developing the possibilities of independent thought while in doll state. Now there's an evil twin who's out to get her -- or Carolyn anyway. Best part is all extended part for our favorite geek stud, Tofer. Only problem is this episode is kind of like a roller coaster ride where you get to the top, start to go down but are suddenly zapped back to the passenger platform. At the end, I had the sensation of missing a major portion of the ride. This reminds me of the limp plots created by Whedon right after Angel left the Buffy series until the romance with Spike heated up. Hopefully this trend will reverse itself in the next few episodes."
5,Great! Joss Whedon did it again,"I'm sad that this is the end of the entire show but I am very glad that Joss Whedon was able to complete the series. Now I personally think that the show ends on the episode called ""The Hollow Men"". I don't like Epitaph 1 (on season 1), nor Epitaph 2 (on the last season); it felt weird for me. Otherwise I love the show. Worth having in your Joss collection.lol"
5,Another outstanding sci-fi series sent to an early death,"Much like Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles earlier in the year, 2009 sees another outstanding television series put to an untimely death. And both were on Fox. First, I have to admit I was not much of fan of Joss Whedon's other series (Buffy, Angel, and Firefly), but Dollhouse was nothing short of spectacular. It was a brilliant concept with intense, efficient writing and great character development. Another reviewer hit it on the head saying this show packed more in 26 total episodes than most series do over their lifetimes. Dollhouse is one of the great sci-fi shows of all time. It amazes me how much action, plot, intensity, and growth were packed into such a short series. It's one of the greatest shows that nobody watched. What a shame. And thus as usual we are left with plenty of vanilla shows about doctors, cops, and lawyers. If's a show is intelligent, creative, and original, it doesn't stand a chance."
5,The greatest series in a long time,"I *loved* this series to no end. It's so sad to see it go. Do yourself a favor, buy this box set and don't let it go. Just skip episode two and you will love everything else. I am basing this on 10 out of the 13 episodes of the second season as the final three haven't aired but 9 out of 13 being great seems to be worthy of the box set purchase considering how high the hits are."
5,Good show,"This was another great show by Joss Whedon. Eliza Dushku is one of his commonly used actresses, and one of my lesser favorites. Still, she pulls it off, and the writing is fantastic. An interesting plot, wrapped up nicely in this second season. For Joss Whedon fans... Season 2 of Dollhouse is like the movie Serenity was for Firefly. You miss a few things in order for them to jump far enough ahead to finish the story he wanted to tell, but it's a heck of a story."
5,Not enough seasons,"I love this show, i discovered it on Netflix and had to have it. Wish there was more seasons though."
4,Short lived but not short sighted,"Dollhouse was a show that left you thinking, ""Huh?"", but filled in it's blanks with episodes that brought you into this exotic world that left you wanting to see more but in the end, being on a network like Fox, the less the better. It was a show that tried to make you believe that technology, while a wonderful tool, can become quite lethal in the wrong hands and our future could evolve to look like one where technology is no more a solution to our problems than a bigger problem where people begin to lose faith (faith, hah!) in themselves.Give thanks to Eliza Dushku and Joss Wheldon for bringing these concepts to your living room now on DVD. It is an experience you will not so easily dismiss."
3,Interesting concept but poor acting,"Bad acting, but story line pretty interesting. It's is all I have to comment on this series. Thank you for asking."
4,pretty good,"The second season really came together to finish strong. I loved it!!! The best part was that they wrapped up any loose ends, giving the series an ending!"
5,Love for Eliza,"I heart this woman in anything she does. I own pretty much everything she's been in with the exception of 1 movie, The New Guy I think it is. But I will be investing in that soon enough. I really wish they would rethink and bring this series back."
5,Love this show!,I cant believe this show got canned! This so is so smart and sexy! Not for young kids but everyone should check out this show!
4,"Less Organization, but handy","Got this bag because I am crunched on space and weight restrictions flying to Spain this summer. It will serve it's purpose. The inside has no compartments for those of you who like the seperation of church and state so to speak, but it does have a sturdy hanger and side compartments for small objects. The inside is pretty large for good size brushes, bottles and stuff. Will update this review after I actually use it!"
3,Not as big as it sounds,The description makes it sound roomier than it is. It's a nice size but its not bigger than any other toiletry bag I've encountered. It would fit shampoo bottles but then not anything else.
5,Great product!,"I love this headset. I recently had an online conference, it sounded like I was in the same room as the speaker. I have not had a lot of experience with the mic yet, but I love the headset!"
2,wiring went faulty 2 months in,"2 months in:I'm tough on headphones. I know it. I'd previously had headphones go out after about 6 months because I walk away with them still attached to the comp, and around my neck. These lasted barely 2 months, at my computer desk, never travelling or unplugged! The speaker is going out on the right ear, and I have to constantly jiggle the wire for sound.Initial Impression:It works great, fits comfortably, has the right adjustments on the cable, and didn't require anything extra.Perfectly what I expected and wanted it to be."
4,"Headset good, discomfort after 1 hour","Satisfied w/ headset. Haven't used microphone yet. Headset feels uncomfortable after about an hour, need to rejiggle it over the ears once in a while. Sound quality pretty good."
5,These honestly are the best Headsets i've bought ever.,"I purchased these over a year ago, and since I got them out of the packaging they were an amazing headset. However recently the wire has broken (clearly it was my fault). I am doing a little searching but ultimatly i think i will purchase these ones again, because they really are a good headset for me. They are all that I ask for."
4,Good headset!,"Works very well. Headset is comfortable. Makes a good headset for an MP3 player, too. Not much use of the microphone yet.... The cord seems to be fairly good quality for an inexpensive headset."
1,Too painful to consider using,"For a cheap product my expectations were low but not nearly low enough. These headphones were unusable. The headset is so narrow it felt like they were pinching my head and caused the cuffs to put way too much, pressure on my ears. I am a very small woman so it isn't as if I have an enormous noggin. My ears hurt the whole time I was wearing these and after only an hour my ears were hurting so much I had to take the headset off. Also, the braided cable touching my shirt created a lot of noise in the headset."
3,Isn't Detox supposed to Detoxify?,"I'm on day 4 and I'm wondering...how does this product work? I don't understand where the detox part comes into play. Detox is supposed to rid the body of toxins so if you're not getting rid of anything, how does it work???Overall I feel more healthy, but I really think it has to do with drinking all this water. I eat less and get full more quickly because I am downing water all day to avoid the headaches. Drinking more water is obviously a good thing for everyone so I guess if all I get out of this is an addition to water, I'm okay with that.If you are looking to lose weight or cleanse your colon...this is not the product to buy."
2,Don't know how people describe this as metal???,"Read some reviews on this CD on this site and it sounded like people were describing it as metal. So i went out and bought it on that basis. Boy was i disappointed. There is no way this CD is a metal CD. It is wishy washy pop rock at best. Nothing heavy about it at all. I must admit i have only listened to it a few times but i can't see myself listening to it much more. A lot of the songs are slow and no heavy guitars no screaming solos' the singing a mild. I like a lot of other bands that seem to lumped with this one like Breaking Benjamin, Hoobastank, Evans blue, 10 years and Three days Grace all great bands this band isn't in the same league to those band."
2,Nothing new here........they should listen to Fozzy,"Sounds a bit dated......it's not bad but the songs tend to be too similar. I like my CD's to have more variety, like Fozzy and their All That Remains Reloaded CD...."
2,Guess I'm #3 to recomend the new Fozzy CD instead!,Do yourself a favor and do as other reviewers are saying and check out the new Fozzy All That Remains Reloaded. It's absolutely incredible.All That Remains Reloaded (W/Dvd)
5,Love Puddle of Mudd!!,This is a great CD for rock fans...with a few singles everyone knows & other awesome songs that haven't received radio play yet. It's fun to rock out to in the bathrom when getting ready for a rockin' night out!!
3,Unexpectedly Sub-Par,"I was really expecting great things from POM after hearing Famous for the first time. However, my expectations were not met. There are a couple of great ballads early on, but once moonshine hits, the album takes a turn for the worse. I wouldn't recommend it."
2,Master Thieves!,"So, The Kurt Cobain wanna be voice, the rip off of the Suicidal Tendencies song ""I saw your Mommy"" from a previous album on ""She hates me"", now ripping off lyrics from Dire Straits ""Money for nothing and the chicks (are for)for free"". When will this end and you damn idiots quit buying this vomit of music."
2,Tiki Art? What?,"I love everything Tiki. I thought that this would be a good book about Tiki art. It is, but it is not. Still waiting for the tiki effect to kick in. The art and Artist are great. But the way the book was put together left me wondering what the freak. Cheap Comic book version of a art book. Try it. You may want to return it. You may want to keep it like I did. Because I love Tiki, I kept it. My wife wanted me to return it."
3,Wrong Pads,"Im giving this a average rating review only because i wasn't able to test them out.This is the first time i bought these pads. I decided to finally change the brake pads my self. Amazon allowed me to enter the type of car i own in their garage. I drive a 2008 Cadillac CTS 3.6DI. These brake pads apparently were suppose to fit my car. The Amazon page said ""This product fits your 2008 Cadillac CTS"" When i received it, I started work on replacing my brake pads. When i was ready to replace the pads themselves. I realized the Hawk Pads were too long. FAILED! I was really excited to try these new ceramic pads, too bad. The page also mentioned it fits 2008 Cadillac CTS with performance package? I'm not sure what that means. My car does have the performance package from the dealer yet the pads were too long. Maybe they meant the Cadillac CTS-V? Oh wells im going to return these and try the wagner brake pads that fits the 2008 Cadillac CTS w/o Performance package."
4,wonderful recording but...,"I think that this is one of those ""underground"" classics that people hear mentioned in other reviews of Italian progressive music but have not heard it. I, for one, took the chance and bought a copy. It is captivating, wonderful and rough around the edges. It is indeed contaminated classical (baroque) music but a fascinating one that should delight any fan of symphonic rock.Now, for the one star from being an overall masterpiece. The K2 24 bit mastering has significantly broadened the sound. The bass is low and articulate. The midrange is ""in your face"". The treble, is overbearing. I had to make a copy of the recording, turning down the treble significantly to make it palatable to the ears. It was almost painful to hear the violins.For the money, it should be a great recording, not one that needs further correction. Where was the engineer? What happened?"
2,It just didn't work,"I understand that this is a series and that there is already a sequel or two out on the market. So that means that someone out there liked this book. I am not that person. I read a lot of this type of novels, so I have a general idea what to look for. This book does has have action, but that isn't enough. The book is hard to read because I had trouble staying with the book. There are novels that once you start reading them, they flow and you find yourself caught up in them. This one is jerky in the action scenes. The characters don't mesh well in the story line. Maybe the second novel is smoother, but I am not sure I would want to read another one. Besides the ending of this novel seems to indicate that this will be a short series of books anyway."
1,I was ripped off too.,"I ordered this cd and got a reggae greatest hits set. The disk label and jewelcase insert both say Ravi Shankar, but the music inside isn't. DON'T BUY THIS CD!"
1,I Too,I too was ripped off by buying this CD.The CD inside is labeled Ravi Shankar...but the music is something completely different...a lousy reggae CD by some unknown artist.
2,Get the international version,This US release is missing several special features found on the international version. Buy from amazon uk.
4,Movie? Tremendous. Extras? Nil.,"Just the Kurt Russell and John Carpenter commentary, that's it.This is disappointing, to say the least, considering that this title was just released on the now-defunct HD-DVD format with, in addition to the commentary, an excellent several-part making-of docs featuring the entire cast and crew, including Rob Bottin explaining his bizarre creature FX!But the transfer of the movie on blu-ray is magnificent.(sigh) Next go 'round...way to double-dip our wallets, Universal."
4,The Thing 1982,"I've always liked this movie. Better than the remake. Again, was not boxed properly. The big bubble wrap was at the bottom of box."
3,The Thing,"Wilford Brimley without a mushtach, worth it already. Good special effects for the time. And this research facility had more drugs and alcohol than a Amsterdam club on a Saturday night."
2,More sci-fi than horror,"This was my first time seeing this, ""I was not too impress with it"" I could of skip this movie I went 30yrs avoiding this movie not on purpose just by chance I should of keeped it that way."
3,It's a GOOD THING. It has some good suspense. Worth watching once.,"I was impressed and pretty scared when I first watched it on VHS a long time ago. However when I watched it again a couple of years ago, I found it not as good as Aliens 2. It still have some good suspenseful moments. The special effects are not as good as those of Aliens 2.It's definitely worth watching once."
4,"GOOD MOVIE, GOOD RENDITION!",a good movie (although not as good as the orig!) looks great and sounds great for an older film thanks to hd dvd reproduction! a good watch and addition to your collection but not your hd HT show piece!
2,Thoroughly Disappointed and,"This movie I rented from Blockbuster and it's a great thing that I waited. I would not have paid more than the $1.99 I paid to watch this flick. The 1982 version was better by a landslide. The effects although not advance as digital effects are today, but at least I saw more blood, guts and gore. The storyline was kind of all over the place. To me it just seemed like there was too much going on in the short story window. And the ending, don't let me start, WAS WHACK!!I am so tired of Hollywood remaking or covering old movies. People need to be more creative!"
3,Thing Bluray,I would have given this a higher rating but the HD/DVD not only is a better transfer but has more extras. I was very disappointed that the Bluray was lacking the extras my DVD had. The movie is a great transfer but most Blurays are still not up to HD/DVD quality. It is a testament to which was really the better format.
1,Borefest monstrosity,"a group of researchers from antarctica discover one of their dogs mutanting into some weird looking creature only to discover that some alien substance replicates anything it gets in contact with. so it works it way onto humans. very long movie, way too talky, no action or suspense, nothing is entertaining about it, not even scary, its a movie that never gets to the point and when it does it goes back to being just a boring watch, the creature at the end was a cool design for the 2 seconds they showed it on screen and then suddenly it gets destroyed, then the movie is over. good to watch if u can't go to sleep cause this one will do the trick. don't get all the hype or why this is a classic."
1,Where's Adrienne Barbeau,Where is Adrienne Barbeau in this movie starring Kurt Russell? I guess the review for this would be better if you could get the actors & actresses right
1,Please don't confuse this terrible movie with the 1951 Masterpiece,"Please don't confuse this terrible movie with the 1951 masterpiece, 'The Thing from Another World'.Lots of pointless blood and gore. I would have to be 'court ordered' to see this movie again.The 1951 'The Thing from Another World' is 5 Stars."
5,5 STARS ARENT ENOUGH FOR THIS MOVIE !!!!!,"Honestly i very often have doubts to give a movie 5 stars, BUT NO DOUBT AT THIS ONE THAT 5 STARS ARE NOT ENOUGH. 10 stars would be a good start. I would be happy to see a sequel to it, BUT THIS MOVIE IS TOO GOOD TO CONTINUE WITH A SEQUEL, EVEN CARPENTER ISNT ABLE TO BEAT THIS MOVIE WITH A SEQUEL OF IT, ITS JUST THE BEST HORROR MOVIE THERE IS, AND EVER WILL BE (iam sorry to say that but even the SILENCE OF THE LAMBS or SEVEN couldnt scare me near THE THING did. And at last i have a big question: ARE MOVIES LIKE SCREAM OR ""...LAST SUMMER"" REALLY INTENDED TO SCARE PEOPLE ?!"
3,"Where can I find the original ""special edition"" with the plastic slip cover??","There originally was a ""Collector's Edition"" of this film with a slide cover, where may I be able to find this??"
3,OK,"OK movie, I thought the HD side of this movie was a bit ordinary, not much better than DVD. I wouldn't spend the extra to buy this again in HD, DVD is good enough.Story OK, entertainment value OK."
4,Darn Good Film,"Great film, but really no need to soil your drawers, write all caps, etc. This film will not change your life, will not change cinematic history, whatever."
1,Not as good as the DVD!,"Universal scrimped down on the features. Features that WERE ALREADY CREATED FOR THE DVD COLLECTOR'S EDITION! For example, the awesome documentary HAS TO BE SEEN IN PIP! Surely the'll release an Ultimate Edition or something, but for now I'll keep my Collector's Edition DVD."
4,The Thing 2,This is a sequel that really hit a home run. And you never see it on tv. Kirk Russell is excellent. The color and special effects makes this vastly different from it's previous installment.I would say 3and1/2 stars.
5,Just how I remembered it....,I really enjoyed the gore although the movie was a bit short but still good.
3,"Again one great movie,but lame edition!!","I don't see why is this a collectors edition because I got only the box and a DVD!!!No cover art,no poster(s),no nothing!If you want just a good movie-order it,if you want a collector's edition DON'T order this!"
4,something wrong,"I buy this excellent movie.. but some data in the page it's not true:Available subtitles: Spanish, English (captions)The DVD don't have Spanish subtitles.. now.. what can i do?"
4,"Very cool,","This was an interesting movie. It takes ALOT to scare me when I watch Horrors, this one was so plot thickened that it ALMOST scared me. It kind of reminded me of the Abyss, which is't scary and really had nothing to do with this. But none the less, It is a Carpenter movie, and it is a MUST see!"
3,"not quite as good as the 1951 version,but still pretty good (3.5/5)","i have to admit,i actually liked the 1951 version of this filmbetter.don't get me wrong,this is still a good film.it has a good dealof suspense.the setting is good,the whole being isolated in a remotelocation,nobody around for miles scenario.Alien had the same sort ofvibe a few years before with the added element of claustrophobia in themix,and did a better job.The Thing is just a little too slow and drawnout.add a few scenes of chaos and noise for effect,and a creature thatjust didn't do it for me in terms of how it looked and moved.despitethat,i did like the whole mystery element to it.that was well done.andthe ending was interesting.you sort of have to draw yourconclusions.for me,The Thing is a 3.5/5"
3,A fairly good horror movie,"This movie was pretty good. Kurt Russel and the other actors played their parts well. The only bad thing was that there was hardly any suspense throughout the movie.But, if you like a good gross-out movie give it a try."
2,Not as good as the old 1951 classic,"I just saw this film, though it was made around 1982. I had talked it up to my foreign-born wife, thinking it would be close to the James Arness ""Thing."" I think Carpenter tried too hard to be different, or more complex. The monster alien was spaghetti on grasshopper legs, with facial gyrations that reminded me of the Arnold flick of Total Recall. I really think the 1951 movie was better, despite it being in B&W with no great special effects. I was disappointed."
5,Best Horror Film Ever,The Thing (Collector's Edition)An incredible film that shows that real characters and in credible practical effects make a horror film work rather than gore and CGI
5,Who goes there? AN alien!,"WOOOOOOOOOOOOOW. Good movie. WHY DID CRITICS DISLIKE IT?! Maybe cause they thought it sacrificed character and mood for special effect, but when you watch it now it doesn't seem like that at all. Or maybe they cant take a little blood , okay a lot of blood.A GREAT movie, with the most freakish unsuspecting scenes of all time (the blood test). Also the DVD features ar top notch."
5,The Lord of Horror Films,"John Carpenter has never matched the level of creative genius he reached in this 1982 movie with Kurt Russel. Easily one of the best horror movies ever made, the special effects astound me even after 20 years."
4,One of Carpenters classics,"I haven't seen The Thing in many years and was quite happy to catch it late last night. As far as remakes go this one is one of the best. The film involves a team of scientists as they come across a frozen spacecraft in the artic. They stumble across a body in the wreckage and deide to thaw it out, unknowingly opening the door to a mysterious alien force that can take shape/replicate anything it comes into contact with. This is a truely terrifying concept.The atmosphere is exceptional. Taking place in the artic leaves you with a dark chilling feeling that could not be duplicated. This film is an abosulte classic with some great effects for the time. I wouldn't say that it beats out Halloween for Carpenter's masterpiece by any stretch. But it is without a doubt a close second. I would absolutely recommend this for any horror/sci-fi fan if you aren't already aware of it."
2,Blu-ray is missing key features...,"The transfer looks great, but the blu-ray skimps on the features that were included on the normal DVD. There is no 80-minute documentary. Now you only get the picture in picture feature during the film. The original stereo audio track is not included in the audio options. Now, you only get 5.1 mixes. Not everyone has a surround setup. The isolated score that was on the DVD has been removed.Beware, if you're replacing your DVD copy. While the film looks better and the aspect ration has been corrected, it's missing all the above stuff."
4,A sheer joy,"One of the beast creature-features to come out in the early 80's (the other being An American Werewolf in London). Considering that all of these effects are practical with no CG what so ever speak volumes. It has some of the most creative and visually stimulating sequences I've had the pleasure to witness.My only complaint is that it's a ride that ends far too soon for my tastes, but then the golden rule of show-business is ""always leave them wanting more"".The fact that this film was panned by both critics and your average moviegoer speaks far more about the naysayers than the film itself. This is a quality piece of work, intelligent and possessing a fascinating (if somewhat bizarre) aesthetic."
5,The Thing (1982),"I consider this to be the greatest horror film of all time. That being said, the product itself is lacking. Unlike the old collector's edition, the blu-ray only comes with the the commentary track, skipping all the other cool stuff like the deleted scenes, theatrical trailer, and the documentary on the creation of the film! Despite this flaw, the picture is great and the film itself is a masterpiece. This movie is a must see for horror/sci-fi fan anywhere and should be included in any film buffs collection.By the way, I've noticed that some of the reviews on this page are for the 2011 prequel...beware!"
5,Still scary!,"The great thing about this movie is the fact that there is an extreme sense of paranoia. John Carpenter does a fantastic job of making it frightening but not resorting to a bunch of teen slashers. Kurt Russell does an awesome job and the film doesn't rely on the top stars in the world to get the big bucks. It is done masterfully from start to finish. Yea, it's that good.Basically a lone outpost discovers a terrifying ""virus"". This virus is interesting in that the make-up department does a really great job with it. They make it look scary and make the sense of dread even cooler. This movie is great, but ""the fog"" is still a little scarier."
1,Won't play,"I bought this dvd twice,one in October,2011 for christmas and thatone didn't play.So i bought one in February and it did not play.I try to play them on three dvd players."
5,This is what DVD was ment to look like!,Outstanding transfer to DVD. This is a classic Sci-Fi/Horror movie with everything that you could ask for. The quality of the DVD transfer would make you believe that this movie was just in the theaters. With a new 5.1 dolby digital audiol soundtrack it can not be beat. A must have for any serious Sci-Fi/Horror buff!!!
5,THE THING,"THE THING has to be one of John Carpenter's stand-out horror films, especially in terms of special effects. The plot is simple: A team of scientists in the Ant-artic are terrorized by a shape-shifting alien being from another world. The only problem is, who's the alien, and who's human? There's plenty of suspense, drama, thrills, and over-the-top gore. I recommend this to fans of both action, sci-fi, and horror films!"
4,"Little violence, minor suspense, extreme gore...","It's a ... shame that they don't put Howard Hawk's original 1951 classic THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD on VHS, but since they didn't this is the next best thing. Carpenter takes his liberties in unfolding the story, but these gross-out effects are sure to keep you awake for awhile. More menacing than disturbing, this film is not THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL or 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, and certainly if you like TV shows (TWILIGHT ZONE, THE OUTER LIMITS, LOST IN SPACE) you'll be put off, but those who can use their diabolically sickening imaginations should eat it up. Maybe four and a half."
4,five star movie without blu ray extras,"This is a classic movie that really looks great on blu ray. The only problem is that Universal decided not put deleted scenes and other extras on it. There is no excuse for not putting the same extras that a special edition has on a blu ray because the price is the same. SO the movie gets five stars, the transfer looks great but you just don't get any extras. At this price you should get all of the extras that a special edition has. This flick though remains one of the best sci fi movies ever made and it's just too bad that they decided to remove any decent extras."
4,One of the Scariest Movies EVER!!!,"I grew up enjoying old Monster Movies on TV. The ""Thing"" was one of my favorites.The remake, with it's terrifying effects, gave me many new nightmares!!This is my third home version, already having the VHS and DVD versions.(I even had an 8 mm copy of the original when I was a kid).I must say that the sound was EXCELLENT on the new, Blue-Ray disc.However, the picture clarity didn't seem as fantastically clear as more recent movies that I purchased for my new player.That said, you will certainly enjoy ""The Thing"", no matter what format you see it on!"
5,Excellent service,It is an excellent product and the delivery service was excellente as well. I will keep ordering with you guys.
5,Sci-Fi Horror and Style,I was about 9 years old when I first saw this in theaters and now i'm. Its the only movie I can remember seeing when I was that young. I remember thinking that was the absolute scariest coolest thing I have ever seen. It was just so real and believable. It was almost like you were watching footage of something that really happened.
5,SciFi at its best...,SciFi does not get any better than this. This is a perfect example of the remake being far superior to the original.
4,the thing dvd,"a good flick!but you must see!!! the original 1949 version first,it still stands out even though it was made before the advent of special effects with James Arness as the thing"
5,THIS IS WHY REMAKES ARE MADE!,"""The Thing"" is one of the best remakes I have ever seen! I saw this at the theater when it was released and it was a jaw dropping experience! Not only were the FX incredible for the time, but the character development and intense paranoia added to the remake, really made a difference. I am a fan of the original,but this is one of those rare occasions were the remake just might be better than the original."
4,I REALLY LIKE THIS MOVIE,"This is one movie that I can watch again and again. The story line is good, the characters are like people you know. Its a very easy film to watch. I can only think of one point that I didn't feel was right, with the firearm being used there would be no way of missing that dog. Buy it, you will enjoy watching it. A very good movie."
5,One of the best horror films of all time,"What's it about?An American research team do battle with a shape-shifting alien while inside an Antarctic research station. The freezing temperatures become the least of their worries as the alien transforms into one of them and mis-trust ensures.Is it any good?The dynamism of this film is within the paranoia, an inability to detect who could be `the thing' leads to terrifying results. Like being afraid of the alien isn't enough, when the `every man for himself' complex is thrown in what the hell do you do?. There are no weak links in the cast, Kurt Russell and co all do their part brilliantly. The effects are amazing! Who needs CGI to create realistic looking gore? This film still holds it's own today. In my opinion John Carpenter's best work, a true masterpiece.Best bit?MacReady's blood test to determine who is the thing, an awesome scene!Did you know?Nick Nolte turned down the role of MacReady, as did Jeff Bridges."
5,Best of the Best,Simply the best movie of it's kind...scary with incredible effects.The scene where they do the blood test to expose the creature should go down in history as one of the most disturbing EVER....
4,"I usually don't care much for remakes, but...","The remake of The Thing is almost just as good as the original. Call me old fashioned but the ones I came to love first always seem the best. This one however, is very good.Kurt Russel is the star and when when he comes out with that over sized cowboy hat on, I about busted a gut.I really liked the way they did The Thing in this one. In the original, it was a veggie monster who growled, bashed and killed. Here it's more like an infective virus with legs.The special effects are good, especially when the head sprouts legs and eye stalks, then tries to run away. One caution however, if you are a lover of dogs, and can't stand to see them victimized by monsters, then don't see this one. It will disturb you.Good movie all the way around and I definitely reccomend it."
4,The Thing (1982),"The Thing(1982-I am not sure I have seen the original) is a good suspenseful yet disgusting and gory (overdone) movie. It's Horror with Sci Fi and limbs ripped off, heads moving,dogs mutating. it creeped the hell out of me growing up and then seeing it again. I guess 82' was a good year!(I was born ;) )"
4,Chilling.,"""The Thing"" is a great but flawed movie. There are scenes in this movie where JC raises the tension and suspense to a level unrivalled by any horror film. (For example, the scene where the characters are all tied to their chairs along with the alien was exquisitely suspenseful) However, the movie does have gratuitous blood and gore scenes, and ends rather lamely, with a typical hollywood action scene; this scene was completely incongrous with the rest of the movie, with its chilling and subtle psychological suspense and build up. Despite these weaknesses, I completely recommend this movie to anyone interested in horror, sci-fi, or just a plain old good time."
4,Things for the memory,"I often wonder if I am the only one who rates this movie above the Howard Hawks film? Admittedly it has been nearly 15 years since I saw that version (and would like to see it again) but I never really liked it. John Carpenter's version does greater justice to the original John W Campbell Jr novella.This is the classic Sci Fi plot of an isolated group of people at the mercy of some horror. The added menace comes from the fact that the enemy is definitely within - in more ways than one. As paranoia and tension mount the question is not only who can you trust but who will start pulling the trigger just to make sure?This DVD is a good transfer with a good soundtrack. The additional features are interesting and help build a picture of the making of the film. It is a pity that more members of the cast weren't interviewed.This is one film I would like to see on the big screen as I have only ever seen it in on video, TV or DVD. How about a 20th anniversary re-release in 2002?"
4,Creepy film,This film is very creepy and there's a suspensful feel throughout the film. Kurt Russell is very good in this one. He delivers a strong performance and is easily believable here. The remainder of the cast is just as strong. I recommend the dvd for the movie and also for the extras included. If you like alien thrillers and gory horror as well then this is your movie. There are plenty of in-your-face gore scenes. The alien concept in this film is very neat because it could look just like the person sitting next to you watching this film. Enjoy!
2,"Okay, but....","ehhh, it's ok. Not great, not a high point in Carpenters career, but it's worth renting. Not a classic, but if you are in the mood for a horror movie and ""Halloween"" is rented, I'd have no problems renting this one. Buying it would be a REAL problematic thing though..."
1,How Is This In The IMDb Top 250?,"This could easily have been a Star Trek episode and have been wrapped up in half the time. If only they had a universal translator or spoke Norwegian! The Thing may have been state of the art in 1982, but it just looks cheap in the 21st century where we are used to awesome CGI effects.I cannot believe that these men are ""researchers"" - they seem more guys you would find in a police station, both the cops and the criminals. So, you can get high at the research station? And roller skate around it? Not very professional, indeed.Kurt Russell channels Escape from New York's Snake Plissken for John Carpenter who directed both films. How does Kurt's R.J. MacReady, who is the station's helicopter pilot, know everything and always have the right answer? MacReady wears the worst hat ever worn in the movies.Don't bother with this unbelievable farce."
3,The Thing - The Remake,"Although this was indeed a scary film, I don't feel it can compare with the original. It is a good production but lacked the suspense and tension of the black and white version made in the 50's."
5,Great one,"Being a horror movie buff, this review will have many good things to say about The Thing. The plot is good, the acting is good, and the special effects are seamless (except for when the tentacle grabs the detonator at the end). The cast includes Kurt Russell, whose career was taking off at the time, veteran actor A. Wilford Brimley, and Keith David. Being not even born when the movie came out, and only exposed to the ultra-edited versions of The Thing on TV, I never really had the chance to appreciate it until I rented it a few years back. So, as the readers may have already assumed, those who want to see the film should rent it or buy it, if you are so inclined. Even nearly 20 years after its theatrical release, there are plenty of surprises and gory but very cool effects. My favorite is the ""defibrillator scene.""Don't watch this movie if you are scared easily or like endings where the hero wins it all and everything is tied up in a neat little package."
5,Some scary entertainment?,"Watch this!!!!!! Special effects are SO REAL,it might be possible you won`t be able to sleep for a couple of days. The dog transformation is a kind of ""appetizer"" will make you cover your eyes with your hands and let you guess what you`ll get afterwards.Have fun!!!!!!!"
3,Good but...,"Hold your horses!!!. This movie is not THAT good. The story is good but is way too similar to Alien, which is an infinitely better film. The quality of the DVD is excellent, not the best I've seen but, bearing in mind that the movie is 15+ years old, it is impressive. And so are the special effects, quite nasty at times."
2,The Thing,"The 75 veiwers that gave this DVD 4.5 stars. Must have widescreen television and straight stereo sound.I watched this DVD on a 27"" full screen television and a Bose surround sound system with a powered sub woofer.I found the widescreen format(not that I had a choice of formats) very distracting and of poor color and diffinition. Surround sound was vertually non existant.I also have an old VHS stereo version and enjoyed all aspects of this format far better that the DVD.Lou"
2,it was soooo slow....,"We watched the movie twice because the first time we fell asleep. We got so tired of watching guys walk through snow, trudge through snow, run in snow and ect. I get that it is an isolated area and the men are trapped with the thing. However, not alot happens until the group decides to do a blood test which is more towards the end and even then the ending is rather lackluster."
4,"Fun movie, great transfer!",This is a great transfer. Creepy movie with extremely nice detail for an old film. I highly recommend!
4,Carpenters best???,"...I think it looks like!!!Until now, this is the best piece of work, Carpenter directed. Dark, rough and absolutely claustrophobic. Some of the SFX look kind of cheesy, but don't forget: The movie is over 20 years old...I luv it ;-)"
4,Nice!,"This Blu-Ray version of John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" has an incredibly sharp picture and amazing sound, the best I`ve seen and heard, and I`ve seen them on all formats including the now defunct HD version. One drawback to this version is the lack of all the extras that were included on the HD version. There is a side track commentary by Carpenter and Russel which is a must hear if you want the stories behind the making of the film. 4 stars out of 5, but only because the other extras were left out. That said, get yourself a Blu-Ray player if you`ve got a HDTV and make this Blu-Ray movie one of the first you buy."
4,"Works fine, chairs a little small for larger folks","Table is good quality and size for putting inside a tent room. Chairs are a little small for full size adults, but will do the job. Good quality materials and workmanship and price is good too."
4,Functional and sturdy...,"I ordered this for use as a field table when doing astronomical observations. It's light, portable and while the stools are not what I sit in while doing my imaging sessions, they work great for those who want to stop by and sit for a while. Construction is adequate for the type of table it is--plenty strong enough to support books, computer, maps, etc. A great buy."
1,"great rapper, sh#t album!!!","Melo is one of my favorite rappers uv all tym but this album chugz kok an HARD!!! awful raps an lyrix frum a distant and uningaged Melo amongst some of th worst produxion i have ever heard! i would assume sh*t wuz bad in his lyf at th tym an thus contaminated th music! i tayk no pleasure in gelding this album with Bone Hard Zaggin, Th Gift an Melo's contributions 2 TMT's-""bringing hell on earth"" album being amongst my favorites but this sh@t dont bounce...it barely crawls!!! get his other stuff!!!"
3,Be sure to add to your collection,"I received a copy of Coumba Gawlo's CD from my boyfriend who is from Senegal, West Africa. He told me it was a must hear, and we was right. I enjoyed the music very much. She has a beautiful and powerful voice. It is obvious that she is having fun making music and I was pleased. I enjoyed the second track, SECK most of all."
2,tight trite,A difficult book to get into. Somewhat pretentious. Better to read Bachelard's The Poetics of Space. I would have expected better from Sorkin.
4,It's good but It's too big,"This clock seems very good, but I do not like much is too rough, I recommend it for people with great muscles"
1,Documents to Go Hotsync failure,"I'm not very happy with this purchase, but that's what I get for trying to cheap out.I had to download the 2.0 beta driver to get the keyboard to work with my T3. On the next HotSync, however, I would receive the fatal error ""preferences.c,line:271,Prefdb open"".After searching the Palm support site and the DataViz support site, I found that it is a known incompatibility between the logitech driver and Documents To Go.As the keyboard is discontinued, I doubt that logitech plans to fix the driver. I'm certain that DataViz doesn't plan to fix the incompatibility for the same reason.Don't buy this if use Documents to Go."
4,pretty neat,"Compact, light, portable. A great little keyboard that does the job unless you use your palm like your laptop - not meant for huge writing tasks as the keys are a little close together but if you use it to make notes etc, its brilliant!"
3,Help me Anthony!!!,"I also have a Zire 71, but I cannot, however hard I try, get the keyboard to work with it. The driver I have (beta V2 for Palm os5), screws up the hotsync whether on or off, but it doesn't make it work. If anyone can spread any light on the subject please email me at craig_16@msn.com or leave feedback on this page.On the other had, the keyboard is the lightest, most comapct i have ever had. The metal case gives a secure feeling and when unfolded it is almost the same width as the letters section on a regular keyboard.What I'm saying is, if I can get this keyboard to work, we will grow old together, but if I can't, it's going back."
3,Good to add to your collection,"When I found this book I was sooo happy because it was one for DP""s earlier books and I could not find it anywhere. It was an good read not to her usual standards however. The heroine works Christopher, brother of the hero, and accompanies him to his brothers home for a month of vacation-work. Since the hero believes that she is a rich woman he has no use for her, since he has been hurt in the past by who loved money more than him. Diana tries to squeeze in a secondary story with Christopher and his true love, but she only ends up making it seem forced and wrote it to fill in some blanks. The story with the heroine trying to heal her relationship with her father was better. This is in the same line as her later book ""Blind Promises"". If you find it do get it, nice item for your collection."
3,books sold by mplwegncgned,Woman Hater (Silhouette Romance)The book arrived really fast. I think the description of the book was a little inaccurate. She wrote in used-very good condition. After receiving it I thought it was in good to fair condition. The back cover of the book is damaged noticeably at the top and the bottom spine is damaged.
4,So cute!,"I bought this a while back, it's incredibly cute. Unfortunately, I'm going to have to buy another one because some of the jewels fell off, but I think that's because I showered with it on. Other than that, it's my favorite naval ring and it has a great price!"
1,Let down,"The product didn't list specs, so when I bought it I found out it is for a 3 blade deck. I have a 2 blade deck....same year...same model....so I went to Lowe's and bought the right set that day, off the shelf."
2,no title,"A light-weight book if ever there was one, both in length (144 pages)and depth. Even though she was the first First Lady of any country to have had a ph.d, she comes across in this book as very opportunistic, seeming to play any part necessary to keep herself out of the poverty she came from. And an awful lot of the book is devoted to frivolous matters, like what a clothes horse she is, or what they eat, and the decorations of their various abodes. She just seems hard and self-serving here. And not a little selfish. There is some description of conditions in Russia at the time, but thrown in as a side line only. And at times the writing was a little disjointed, times and dates being out of synch. A book I could have easily skipped. Perhaps as a foreign journalist stationed in Russia, Jurgens just didn't have access to enough info, but then why bother to write the book at all? There were some interesting pictures."
5,The definitive review of the field of parapsychology,"This book was written by Jeffrey Mishlove as a partial fulfillment of his Doctoral Dissertation. He was granted the first PH.D. in a field of science that has been around a long time, yet unexplored in depth by the scientific community. Kudoes to Jeff and his colleagues for having the courage of their convictions and for having published them. I recommend this book highly and sent a copy as a gift to an M.D. friend of mine"
1,Did not even work when it arrived. : (,"Bought this for me and the girlfriend. We had tried the Durex one and we really liked it but it is kinda pricey. So we bought this one instead cause for the same price we got 3. When they finally arrived, not even 1 out of the 3 in the pack worked. We were thoroughly disappointed. When I tried to return it, apparently it is not returnable. I am trying to get a exchange from amazon. Hopefully that works. I would recommend the Durex one though."
5,The Essentials That Every Graduate Student Should Know,"The book offered an extensive resource list, which will become helpful in finding information to develop a literature review.For those students who are discourage about devoting a substantial amount of time to researching a topic, but resulting in nothing that you are compassionate about, don't worry. This book helps you to organize your ideas into steps that are beneficial in resulting in a successful research topic.This book is a great foundation to developing and completing a successful thesis or dissertation."
5,Excellent translation that needs more publicity!,"I love the REB translation as an alternate to the very popular NRSV. Faithful with a rendering of English that makes one see things differently, this translation is not as appreciated and widly known as it deserves to be!"
4,Bought for Styx-Kept for REO,"Yes, the Styx portion can't hold a candle to their ""Return To Paradise"" dvd but if you stop there you are missing 1 of the GREATEST rock dvds of all time. I am very-very critical when it comes to musical content and quality. I am more forgiving of video editing/quality since to me it's all about the music. That being said the REO portion of the disc suffers from neither.EVERY member of REO brings something to the table here people. Especially refreshing are Dave Amatas guitar riffs and Brian Hitts Fabulous drum performance. However, Neil, Bruce and Kevin are no slouches either. This is 1 of the tightest concerts ever recorded IMHO. This is the disc that I consistantly grab when I want to get up and ROCK.Don't miss ""Keep on Rolling"" @ the very end of the disc AND be sure to give a listen ALL of the STYX ""Brave New World "" songs other wise buy ""Return to Paradise "" for the rest of their music."
2,the sound is great on the Styx part but poor on REO.,"Bought this for my wife as a Christmas present as she is a big fan of both bands. The sound quality is great on the first part of the video featuring Styx, but is poor during the REO set. Sounds like they are recording it in a tunnel with the mic on one end and the band on the other end... can barely hear Kevin Cronin sing. The only complaint of the Styx segment is too many hits are not being preformed. No one wants to hear a 20 year old band do some obscure album track or non hit , people want to hear the hits... where is ""Come Sail Away"", ""Grand Illusion"" and others ? I would give this a C- rating"
3,"Great to see the bands, production quality is average","Great energy from both bands. There are a few Styx tunes I really missed (like Crystal Ball), but overall it's a fun DVD.Why only three stars? The production quality is very average. The sounds quality of the DVD is not great. Compared to the better music DVDs out there, it doesn't stand up. I just never got that ""concert"" feel."
5,The best,I've wished that these two bands would tour for a long time!! This video is the best I've seen and these 2 bands continue to crank on as they have for 30 years if you missed the concert please buy this video you won't be disappointed. I say that there was definitly magic in the air on this hot summer night in St Louis not only for the bands but the fans also. Guys this was a job well done.
4,Decent...but not great,"Overall worthwhile, but with some disappointments. Styx sounds great but man that keyboard spinning all around is really annoying. They just aren't the same w/o Dennis but Tommy does sound great.I love REO but Kevin's voice has really lost it's power. It's like he's trying to save it, or maybe just been too many nights on the road. Whatever the case he sings pretty gingerly. The Gary replacement plays great but he seemed to be buried in the mix rather than at the forefront as you'd expect in a rock and roll show. Still a rocking good time (did they need to play Blue Collar Man twice??) and worth the $$ if you haven't been able to catch them live. BTW I thought the camera work was good - not too many annoying audience shots!"
4,extremely useful,"I am several months into seriously trying to learn Hebrew, at the point where I need to expand my verbs and get a better feel for conjugational patterns. There's one helpful Hebrew Verbs website, but other than that, full conjugations of a wide range of verbs with the vowel markings to guide pronunciation is nowhere to be found.But yes, I broke the binding the second day -- it seems to be holding up to constant use, but you have to lay something heavy across it to keep it flat while you're reading."
4,Publisher take note: we need this book in HARDBACK!,"Since most of us who are involved in Hebrew study use a reference book like this constantly, why is it in paperback? Even with careful handling, a thick book like this doesn't stand a chance in paperback. Within a year the owner must contend with loose pages, as others in my class have also discovered. If this problem were corrected, I would immediately rank this as a 5-star book because it contains many verbs along with their vowel markings, and it is far easier to use than Tarmon's Hebrew Verb Tables. (It's good to have both books!) Another problem: Many verbs aren't listed in the index, even though they are actually in the book. This can be frustrating--especially if a person isn't sure of the root of a word. But, aside from these two problems, the book is indispensable to the student of Hebrew!"
1,Confusingly Organized,"The earlier 201 Hebrew Verbs was a masterpiece in that each root's conjugations (binyanim) were presented in the exact same order. In this volume the author chooses to order the binyanim by frequency of use. This is of no value to a student of Hebrew who has to master each binyan's pattern of conjugation. All it does is confuse. In 201 Hebrew verbs, if you wanted to memorize ""Kal"" you would find in on the top left of each set of facing pages and you could compare and contrast slight variations in ""Kal"" by comparing the same location on different pages. You can't do that with this edition making it useless.The inclusion of example phrases is nice, but the lack of consistent organization makes my blood boil and makes it useless as a tool to teach the language.Go back to the older format. Please!!!!"
4,Full Potenial not realized,"When I first read these reviews it convinced me to buy this book. Though it is very useful the only problem it has is it's presentation. if it were presented like some of the other verb 501 books like Spanish, Italian, French, etc.. this book would be golden. Thus this book is hard to follow. don't get me wrong it is a good book but its potenial was not fully realized."
4,"Good book, but confusing order","The book is very helpful, filled with not only the verb conjugations and meanings, but examples, as well. Five hundred and one verbs will get you pretty far in most languages. The only ding against this book, and it's an important one for anyone who has been reading Hebrew for more than a few months is that it is written English style, from left to right, opening with the binding to the left. This can really mess with your mind when you're trying to find a word! By the time you're ready for a reference like this, you're familiar with the alef bet and have probably used a few Hebrew dictionaries. So, as you're looking a a word up, you start with alef and one and and expect tav and the other and look words up in the middle according to that order. It would be helpful if the next version of the book were bound in the opposite direction."
2,Difficult to use,"Thorough. Organized. Pagination as an English book, which always feels a bit odd. Lots of examples. Nicely printed. Biggest problem is that there are no groupings of paradigms. For instance, I want to see the possible forms of a Pe Ayin Ayin verb, as TaMaM let's say. There is no way to find one. This is where the now buried but much mourned Luach haPoalim shone--you could find a paradigm for any root. Rarely have I had a book which has so much valuable, but impossible to get to, information."
3,Should have been organized by lamed infinitive not root,"I found that this book did not display all the aspects of the verb roots. For instance it shows the infinitive for the verb root ""MTZA""-""found"" as only ""L'himatzay""-""to be found, to exist"" when it could also be ""Limtzo""-""to find."" It is, in general, a useful reference."
5,"Great, Easy Reference!","I refer to this book constantly.Very easy to use, interesting, and helpful!Like a good dictionary... with more info."
2,Not so good,"201 Hebrew verbs is much better organized, also it clearly gives every form in which the root is found, in the standard order of the forms. This book gives only some of the forms, and in descending order of frequency of use. It leaves out the rarer forms such as pu'al. Also, it uses far to much full (plene, or malei) spelling for a book with vowels."
3,Classicists beware,"I ordered this copy (501 roots) and was shocked at its size. If you're a student of classical Hebrew (as I am), and just need the charts to remind yourself about irregular conjugations, don't buy this book... get the 201 roots, which has most of the important hollow verbs and other tricky stuff. It's a much more manageable size (the spine on the 501 version broke almost instantly because of the bulkiness). The 501 version is, I imagine, geared toward the student of modern Hebrew."
4,Works well once you get it properly fitted,"The trick to this tool is that you have to have the bridge positioned in exactly the right spot, and you need to get the size that works with your bridge position. So ignore the violin/viola size and only look at the string length.Typically your bridge is placed aligned with the little tick marks in your F holes. But to use these appliques, you must place the bridge so that the length of the strings matches the length indicated on the side of the applique. Choose the size of applique that is closest to your natural string length (nut to bridge) then tweak your bridge location accordingly.The reviewer with the German violin may wish to try a different size in order to get it to work. Just because it says 4/4 violin doesn't mean that is the size she actually needs. The company could do a better job making that clear."
4,Correct Size Will Work,"When buying Don't Fret, be careful to get the correct size. The instructions can be a little confusing. They say that you should measure the violin, and get the Don't Fret that matches the distance between the nut and bridge. My bridge was 13"" from the nut, and so I mistakenly purchased the 3/4 because it read ""3/4 violin, 13"" viola"". Don't look at that number. Instead, look at the number on the SIDE of the decal. On a 4/4 decal it will read 325mm.After adjusting my bridge to just under 13"" (or 325mm), I can say that the Don't Fret works pretty well."
2,Too much for Too little,"I spent as much on shipping for this product, that probably weighed an ounce and had to wait 3 WEEKS to get it! I'd shope else where!"
2,"metaphysics aside,",I'm not sure what everyone else is going on about concerning this book because despite my purchasing it I cannot make out the words. This file is an assortment of images of a hard copy of the book that has been scanned. I've tried viewing it on both my kindle and on my android phone to no avail. It is an image so increasing the font doesn't help. Flipping the perspective into horizontal results in being able to see two whole pages of tiny typeface. I'd rather have it in pdf form and I really don't like reading those on this sort of device either. As far as the work itself I'm sure it's a blast!
1,Too much biased focus on IT,"This book describes well the IT aspects and opportunities of Business Process Management.However, in most projects the challenges are at the organization and people aspects.Furthermore, this book is written by the CEO of an IT company, this gives a bias to the topic, this should have been specified better upfront."
2,Full Disclosure Required,"Regardless of the content of the book, which might be well worth the purchase, please note that Rashid N. Khan is founder and CEO of Ultimus apparently a player in the BPM field. Now the prior reviewer either didn't know that or perhaps found this irrelevant. If the CEO of Ford professed to identify all the best in class for SUV's you might anticipate he would be pointing out features found in his own product line even if sub-consciously, because if he believes in what he says.. he builds them that way.(...)His book may well provide his target market with information, I just choose to read from a disinterested 3rd party for this information. ""BPM the Third Wave"" is a bit higher level look at BPM but they have no products to offer."
4,Good for use in Sentrilock lock boxes,"I'm a real estate agent, and I bought these to use in our Sentrilock electronic lock boxes (box that holds the house key so agents can get in to show the property). These were MUCH cheaper than what our local board charges for the batteries and it's nice to have extra on hand. I've only used one so far and I have no complaints. It's hard to say how long the battery life is and they get used randomly."
1,Five Star for the movie but Not for the DVD,"I think this is one of the worst DVD attempt by Universal Studio. They have totally ignore the fans of this movie. The picture transfer of this movie to DVD was not up to the standard. And why in the world they will only release this in Full Screen format only? What happen to the Widescreen format? I am sure many of us here like to see this movie as it meant to be seen. I felt like cheated by the studio. I should have read the fine print..""FULLSCREEN"" I suggest not to buy this dvd and wait for better quality dvd version of this movie. I think Arnold should say something to the studio..""What Ah you thinking?!!"""
3,Great movie but I will not buy this DVD,Full screen 1.33:1 format? I love this movie but I will not buy the old non-widescreen format. I will wait.
4,cute movie,"Arnold Schwarzenegger is known for his role in violent and R-rated movies like 'Terminator' and such, so it's a bit odd seeing him in a movie geared for kids (not very young kids though, mind you) If's a fairly decent movie - not great, not awful. It's more of the kind of film you rent rather than buy, it's not bad watching once."
4,Mikos The Man!,"Luv this movie! Its really funny, and the actor Miko who plays the littlest kid is so cute in this! Great movie!"
5,funny and creative,"I thought this was a great movie though don't take you kindergarten age children to see it. It was cute, though they should not have this in the family section."
4,A GOOD COMEDY BUT NOT ONE FOR YOUNG VIEWER'S,I liked KINDERGARTEN COP with ARNOLD SCHWARTZENEGGER but I would have to say it's not for kids and here's why. Although there are a lot of funny moments which are too numerous to mention with SCHWARTZENGGER trying to run a class of kids and the situations that arise I found that the end of this film was too inaproipate for a family oriented film how it ends I won't say but you'll see what I mean. So all in all I liked KINDERGARTEN COP but I won't recommend it for all age's.
3,Pleasing,"For a screen play that could have easily gone nowhere, this was a suprise hit. Arnold ""Terminator"" Schwarzenegger plays a cop who (through a twist of fate) must go undercover as a kindergarten teacher.Although there are the obligatory gory scenes, much of the film centers around his adjusting to working with small children and a homey community. The musical score is lovely and shows the actor's real life talent for working with children.Despite the above mentioned praise, it is too convienent that his partner (who has had background training as a kindergarten teacher) gets food posioning the day before class starts. Equally unconvincing is the stereotypical portrayal of the mob mother as a controlling platinum-haired drill seargent. One would have thunk Ivan Reitman could have delivered something more original.Also of note is that the later scenes of the movie should not be seen by small children."
1,FULL SCREEN ONLY,One of the movies that showed there was more then just brawn to Arnold. I would love to own a wide screen (16x9 enhanced) copy. But for some reason the first released copy has never been replaced. The full-screen version was a early DVD effort and not well done.
4,Love Awwwnold!,"Love Arnold Schwarzenegger when he does comedy! This movie is good for adults and children. Some of the subtle comedy is more geered for adults, but definitely a family film."
3,"Entertaining, but not for young kids.....","This story is engaging. Arnold is appealing. You will not be surprised or disappointed if you usually like his movies.Parents should consider the graphic violence before their kids see this movie. Additionally, the plot involves a mom and her 5 year old son who are running away from ""bad people"" who are trying to steal the child away from his mother. Some sensitive kids could be disturbed by this part of the story. Despite the fact that it was advertised as a comedy and that it does have many comedic and touching aspects, I would not recommend it for the kindergarten set.Otherwise, this is good entertainment for Arnold fans."
3,Kindergarden Cop,Great movie bought because like Oregon and Arnold major probelm doesnot come in wide screen donot like point&shoot like to have the whole video not some 2nd editor idea of what is important
4,Cracks me up every time I watch...,"This is a movie that I once had on VHS and finally got the DVD since my VCR died and that I have watched too many times to count. The movie, while not Oscar-worthy, is a great comedy with adorable children and enough action for the Arnold Schwarzenegger fan. Everytime I watch the movie, I laugh at the same parts like I have never seen it before."
3,This is not for the kids!,"This is a decent movie, fast paced and with some funny moments. However, I don't understand why it shows up in the family section. There is a very violent end and some other disturbing scenes throughout the movie."
3,light entertainment,It's light entertainment for a rainy afternoon. Second half of movie the storyline seems smoother.Typical Arnold role of being the Terminator.
4,"Whose your daddy, and what does he do?","This is by far one of Arnold's all time funny movies. I personally love his comedies and this rates close to ""True Lies"" and ""Twins"". During his undercover police work some of the funniest stuff occurs when he must sub a Kindergarten class. I fell out of my chair when he said, ""Whose your daddy, and what does he do?"". Many of his lines can be found at soundbyte sites since they are so funny. One site even used them in a hysterical phone prank. Don't miss this movie. The rest the cast including Penelope Ann Miller as his partner and Linda Hunt as the school principle are great too. Seeing this huge muscular man trying to teach little Kindergarten kids how to march and sing is often comical. Once he finds that he can't be so gruff and the children realize he won't body slam them they are well on their way to learning. Good story, direction, and music make it one of the better comedy cop movies. I highly recommend this reasonably priced DVD."
4,Good,Kindergarten Cop is a good movie. The only bad part is when they shoot each other. when they hit the people is looks like paintballs. Its really cheasy but the rest is good.
2,Shockingly dated,"Sure, Arnold is kind of funny and the kids are very cute, but the constant violence, language, junkies, and aiming guns at small children was a real turnoff in the age of Columbine and other school shootings. I definitely do not recommend this for any children."
5,Excellent instruction & introduction to Bollywood dance,Really enjoyed the instructions of Bollywood dance as broken down into simple steps by Pallavi. Very well worth the price and a great introduction who does not know anything about dancing.
4,fun dvd for beginner,"This dvd is fun to watch and learn. The instructor is very nice, a real person. I enjoyed learning bollywood dance moves. As a Zumba instructor, I liked the cardio portion better than the Dhoom Taana choreography just to learn basic bollywood/bhangra moves that I can incorporate into my own choreo."
5,Not to be Missed !!!!,"With my sub-standard video equipment I get a soft focus image, while on the other hand the audio is outstanding. Whether you're a DCD fan or just curious, I highly recommend this item."
4,Wife loves it,My wife loves listening to Christian music and she has enjoyed this CD on a regular basis.
2,It's good but should have been better,"i'd hate to say it about this book but it's very off on a lot of information needed in the book. it doesn't fully follow the plot in that it says the generals were after the same thing when it was an evolution in the negaverse's plans. it should have had a lot more effort, also in it seems like a child put the book together. I know i could have done a lot better and been a lot more accurate even with no experiance in such a project."
2,This book shouldn't even be called a book.,"First of all, this book is only 16 pages, and it took me around 2 min. to read!!! Although this book has cool pictures, it leaves out a lot about the Sailor Scouts. I recommend it to only those people that are just learning about Sailor Moon. It briefly explains each characters power and their transformation. The only thing that I like about this book is the pictures. They are really cool, and their are some pictures I've never before seen. Also, this book lacks a page on Sailor Jupiter's and Sailor Venus' (my favorite character) descriptions."
3,Excellent for small children,"An excellent book for introducing small children to the world of Sailor Moon. It has large, beautiful pictures that young children will enjoy and want to look at with parents again and again. Adult Sailor Moon fans should note that this product is geared for children 4-8, so it's probably not something that older children or adults will find interesting. For older children I recommend the Sailor Moon chapter books, and kids and adult fans alike should check out the Sailor Moon graphic novels. However, if you have no young children then this isn't the book for you."
1,Not worth it,"OK. I know some of you may be offended by my rating, so let me explain...Meet Sailor Moon is a good book for children, ages 5-7. (If you're older, try the Sailor Moon Junior Readers.) For others, like me, who are ULTIMATE FANS, this book has no meaning whatsoever. It is around 18 pages long and the descriptions are not detailed! I mean, they leave out the Outer Senshi and Sailor Chibimoon!!!If you REALLY want to check it out, try and find it in a bookstore. Then read it there. I mean, it takes you only 5 minutes at the most. It's better than wasting [$] on a book you'll only read once and then say, ""That wasn't very good.""Thanks for listening to me explain. consider this before you buy."
4,"Beautiful Drawings, Not Much Info","If you want gorgeous artwork and the basic facts on the main characters of ""Sailor Moon,"" this is a must have! However, if you're already a big fan and want more information than the average Moonie knows, ""Meet Sailor Moon"" is probably not for you. It's a good introduction to the series and a perfect gift for someone who is just beginning to enjoy the anime phenomenon. Plus, it's got a ton of artwork to look at! /*^_~*\ SM Forever!"
1,Not what it's cracked up to be,"HI! I am a huge sailor moon nut and buy what ever i can (that i like) i got this book and all i have to say is that the reseon that page number is not even on the page is because it is only about 10 pages long. sure it is all color and not very expencive but some of the information in it is even wrong. there is about 2 sentances on each page that mainly say: this is a picture of sailor moon. she uses her moon wand to protect the earth. Any fan of sailor moon would know every single word in this book, from the show and all of the pictures you can get from internet web sites if you wanted to. so i do not suggest this book AT ALL!"
2,Only for a first time moonie,It has a lot of incorrect info and stupid things. It gets of the story and is boring but if you've only seen the DiC episodes you might like it. I also has a lot of pictures to draw.
3,Good for beginning Sailor Moon fans,"This is a good book for you if you just enjoy the DIC series. More serious Sailor Moon fans would find it stupid. There are a lot of good pictures, but you can find just as good or better on the internet."
1,Only for Beginners,I was actually disappointed when I got this book. I read it in 2 minutes and it only had 15 pages. This is only for beginners who are not quite acquainted with Sailor Moon.
3,Sailor Moon,"I have been a Sailor Moon fan for about 2 years now, and I thought this book was great. It's not one of the best Sailor Moon books, but it does have awesome pictures from the TV show and is easy to understand. Anyone who enjoys Sailor Moon, like me, will enjoy this book."
2,"Great movies, Bad production quality.","I was excited to find this 2-in-1 DVD release as I'm a huge Yul Brynner fan and both of these movies are hard to catch. Port of New York is an excellent film-noir which needs to be seen if only to catch a young, skinny Brynner make his movie debut as a very sinister drug boss. I had to give this 2 stars for the poor DVD quality of the Miracle Pictures release. The audio quality is out of synch by a few seconds in the last 20 minutes of Port of New York, enough to really mess with the story. In Romance of a Horsethief, it is rather muffled and unclear throughout, enough to distract and make following the story a bit difficult. Very disappointing!"
1,not worth it,"Still a Y.B. fan, but the quality of both movies were poor and ""Romance"" was boring and I didn't finish watching it."
3,It works well,This product does the job. I have coarse hair so I need to turn it to the highest setting and it does do a decent job of straightening.
4,Good for short hair,"My hair is just shoulder length and fine. I works well for me, but would not be good for thick longer hair."
1,Shoddy Product & Shoddy Customer Service,Jilbere is made by Conair - along with MANY other products (check the labels). CONAIR PRODUCES SHODDY PRODUCTS AND HAS LOUSY CUSTOMER SERVICE.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"I just got this Iron yesterdayAnd it burnt my hair!I always used a CHI, colirios and EliteThis iron always made my hair nice a silky healthy looking hairAnd this one destroyed my nice hair!!For 10 dollar more I just got a REAL CHI."
1,I hate this straightener,"This is the worst straightener I have ever used, I hate it so much! Every time I straighten my hair I just want to throw it across the room. I'm only using it because my friend let me borrow it while I replace my other one that broke about a month ago...ugh.<3"
1,Don't waste your money,This flat iron is not worth the money. It gave out on me quickly. I replaced it with one from Walmart which I've had ever since.
2,First flat iron,"This is my first flat iron, it is a nice size, made well, BUT the dial is in the inside of the flat iron not the outside, so it is very hard to see the numbers of the temp. Now I wish I had bought a digital one!"
1,Didn't work!,"I got this straight out of the box new and it didn't work. I tried plugging it into different sockets (which I knew worked, anyway) and changing the settings. Really not made well! Had to return it!"
2,HATE IT,"I had a CHI flatiron that suffered a dunk in the toilet from my children :=)I thought I would trim $30 from my purchase and go with this one and there is no comparison between the two. My ends are so split up and ruined after using this product for nearly 6 months that it is ridiculous! It constantly pulls and catches my hair, which is painful and terribly uncomfortable. It also ""crimps"" when you turn it to tight, whereas the CHI would always leave a nice curl no matter what!I have only given it this long so that I could ensure that it wasn't ""seasonal"" dry hair, or elements, etc. This product just plain STINKS! Spend the extra $30 and get yourself a CHI--you won't be disappointed!"
2,not as well as expected,"I have bought several flat iron in past within price range of about $20-$25. They all worked fine nothing too special about it. The only thing was that my hairs look dry and bristle every time after used. My hairs are coarse and thick so I was looking for something that doesn't give my hairs that dry unhealthy look. I was willing to spend more but not at CHI price range. My flat iron also broke finally, so I had to purchase one quickly. Let's just say that it doesn't work that much better then a $20 one that I bought from the store. It serves the purpose but I wouldn't buy the same thing if it broke."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,I got this to use at work to touch up when commuting on my bike. Thus I didn't want to spend a lot. I normally use a GVP for $60 which works great. This cheaper one grabs my hair unless I am very careful and grab very small portions at a time. Also it doesn't seem to close all the way and makes my hair have a lot of static. If I weren't only using it once in a while just to touch up I would send it back. Spend a little more and get the GVP which I think is as good as the Chi's I have used.
3,doesnt leave my hair looking good,"the product arrived in perfect shape. Whenever I straighten my hair, it looks great the first day. The product works well and quickly. However what I don't like is that my hair looks dull and flat the very next day, which never happened with my other straightner."
5,Neat,"its works well, very sturdy and does its job most of all, for the price,, u cant go wrong with this amazing little thing."
4,THE ULTIMATE DEFRIZZER.....,I think this straitner works very well but there are some things about it that is not all that great. It does get very hot very quickly but it doesnt get the tips board strait. All though it does get the rest of the hair extremly strait. If all you are lookin for is a straitner to defrizz and flatten this is the perfect one for you. It is well worth the money.....!
3,Don't pay full price!,"For 20 bucks it's a nice straightener. For full price, nah. It's OK. It glides nice on your hair, I'll give it that. It does a good job of straightening, but not any better than my regular metal iron."
4,Love this product,"Straightener works well. Seller was quick and easy to use, I would buy from them again."
2,worked great while it worked!!,I purchased this item the middle of May. It is now Oct. 1st and it won't heat up anymore! Product should last longer than 5 months!!
2,Effective but dangerous.,"The main issues I have with this iron is that it gets incredibly hot on the outside felt area (near the ceramic tongs), and that in combination with the problem that the hand clamp (when used as intended, with your hands on the half of the iron near the cord) does not entirely depress the tips of the ceramic iron together means you have to clamp down further up on the iron (using the felt area) in order to get it to properly depress all the way. Since the iron is poor at keeping the heat only in the ceramic iron part of the tool, you're probably going to be getting your hand burnt if you really want to use this tool effectively.To me that is a fundamental failure in the design of this iron and I can't recommend it at any price."
5,Love it!,"I seriously think the price of this iron is a mistake! its great, straightens right away and leaves ur hair beautiful!!"
2,Not that good for very thick hair,"My daughter has very thick, long hair. Yes, the iron heats quickly. But my daughters hair took so long to straighten and about time I was done, she was upset and I was left with an aching arms and burns on my fingers. I think the old fashioned heat on the stove top iron will work best for my child. She has that biracial hair- half afro american, half white- so it's very thick, curly and long."
4,"Seems to work well, but...","I have had this flat iron for 2 months now and it seems to deliver each time. I have a multi-ethnic (native american, caucasian, african, asian) hair type so to get my curls straight takes lots of heat, time and effort and this product sure delivers HEAT! Thankfully the heat's adjustable. My only uncertainty comes from not being sure that the plates are really ceramic. The color of the plates is a bit off and looks a little too metalic. Thus, I am not sure about the long term effects on my hair (which is natural and has no chemicals in it). For those who have chemially straightened or coloured their hair I would be even more careful about getting this product in the event the plates aren't really ceramic. I wish the manufacturer would get back to me on whether the plates are truly ceramic!"
4,Wish I knew how to use the thing ... looks amazing,"um, I saw a friend's and thought, hey, better than sliced bread, you know? But now that I have it home I can't figure out how it works. That's of course my problem, not the product. It heats immediately, has lots of temperature variations, interior button so it doesn't accidentally get turned off, and seems to do what they're supposed to, and probably will once I figure it out. Sigh. Technology. I am not so good with electric can-openers either."
2,Don't buy this,"I bought this straightener because I wanted a skinny straightener to get closer to the scalp. However, while it is not a horrible product, I have a 15 dollar vidal sassoon one that works much better. I would suggest either buying the really expensive ones or just sticking with one bought at the store. This isn't any better than those."
2,It's OK,"so i will admit it did straighten my hair but i know for a fact that even tho it said it gets up to 400 and sumthin degrees mine sure didnt. the heat was not consistant and it got extra hot everywhere else besides the plates. and this iron does nothing for your hair i mean it was the products that i used that really pulled me through. this iron alone makes your hair limp, lifeless. and it causes damage. there are much better flat irons out there that are designed to help your hair not hurt it. and after 1 year of use. it started smelling like it was burning. like my hair wasnt burning..the flat iron was. my mother advised me to stop using it immediatly. so yea..it works but its not the best. so if your looking for something that will just get you by this is it. im getting a Solia."
2,good,"I liked the design of this Illustrator a lot in the beginning and I was impressed that he has structured for the temperature but it is not often hot and the temperature is very reasonable and can anyone even had a small incurred, so it does not work only for women with fine hair only"
1,Cheap Quality Hair Pulling Straightner,"I ordered this flat iron because of the great reviews I read. However, like some reviews have stated, it pulls your hair, the metal pieces do not shut all the way which means you cannot straighten a few strands of hair, the velvet does get extremely hot so cannot place your fingers on those to close, and the quality is just awful. It feels super cheap. I'm returning this going back to my old Remington."
2,Not too impressed,"This product didnt get hot enough to straighten my hair very well. I probably wouldnt buy it again, but I didnt have any trouble recieving the product. The quality of the product is just not very good."
4,Love it!,"No need to purchase a CHI!!! This flat iron gets my hair really straight and neat looking. I have had it for a whie, and the only con that Ive noticed is that the velvet cover on the outside of the irons starts to peel off after time."
4,Pretty good,"This heats up really fast. I like the small size. The only thing I don't like about it is the heat is so hot I feel like it's damaging my hair. Overall, I like it, I just run it through my hair really fast."
3,"Gets hot, but not a chi.","This flat iron is pretty good and gets pretty hot, but it doesn't make your hair silky like a chi or superstar. It also takes a lot longer to get my thick wavy hair straight. I owned a chi for a year and it stopped working, then I bought a superstar which I dropped and it broke all to pieces, so then I bought this one trying to save some money. I miss the results and the time saved with the chi so I'm going to give in and buy another one. You can get them on ebay for $60 - $70 so I would recommend spending a little extra on something that you will actually be happier with."
2,Not User Friendly,Do not reccommend. The heat control is in the inside handle which makes it impossible to read. Do not like the fabric velvet like handle.
5,Fabulous!,"Great flat iron. I've used more expensive ones that didn't work half as well. I have very tight curls and this iron gets my hair pin straight, and never any static problems. Going out in the rain and humidity has not given me a bit a trouble. I'm ordering another one for backup and also one for a fellow curly haired coworker. Buy it, you won't be sorry."
4,good quality for price,"This is a solid product -- not extraordinary, but reliable and functional. I'm very glad I purchased it. Heats evenly and quickly, does a solid job of straightening hair. Arrived from seller in excellent shape, nicely packaged."
3,2 1/2 years and counting.....,"I purchased this product in May of 2006, and it works exactly the same as when I first used it. I have extremely thick black hair, and I have to admit, this product does an amazing job. HOWEVER, the horrible burnt smell that comes from this flat iron is worse than any other iron I've used before. And the smell stays with you! At first I thought I was hallucinating, but then one day I did my friends hair using the iron and when she walked past me later that day-I smelled burnt hair! So, the moral of the story is if you have thin-medium type hair and know that you won't be using this iron on the highest setting, then this product is definitely for you. IF YOU DON'T, and instead find that the strands of your hair are as thick as dreadlocks, be prepared to smell like burnt hair the first few days after using this product."
4,"Ceramic Tools 1"" Flat Iron","This flat iron works best if you don't have long, thick hair--it's just takes longer for you to get through everything. However, the outcome is great. It does its job. The one problem I have with this flat iron is when I tried to curl my hair with it, the velvet part of the iron (the covering of the ends) melted off. I guess I should have realized something like that would happen, but it just didn't occur to me. Also with the curling part, it's harder if you have long thick hair. But if you have fine hair, even if its long, it works fine. The curls stays curled for a couple of hours. The odd part of the iron is the on and off button. It's set inside of the tongs so if you're not paying attention to what you're doing, you might actually burn yourself."
4,Good for African American hair,"I have been very happy with this ceramic iron. I was going to purchase a Chi iron but didn't want to dish out that kind of cash. I was skeptical of course and read all the reviews. I saw a few reviews from other African Americans and I thought, I can't go wrong with spending $23, so I tried it and I'm very happy I did. The iron does not pull my hair. The edges are rounded and the plates get very hot. That's what I needed."
5,Wow! Great hair!,"I am a natural blond with somewhat wavy hair and the sometimes frizziness that comes with living in Florida's humidity. This iron, at a medium-high setting, transformed my ""do"" into shimmery silk that was straight as a string. The first day I used it, the result drew rave reviews from co-workers. I even had a stranger (young man in his twenties) stopping me to say, ""Wow, great hair!"" I researched the market extensively before buying this product. I had used cheaper type products in the past and was determined to get a top quality ""pro"" iron. This is it and at a very good price!"
2,NOT GOOD FOR CURLS,"I bought this, my first straightener, with the intent of making flat iron curls. I saw videos on YouTube and thought I could do it. The description of this product does NOT indicate that the barrel is covered in a velvet/felt like substance!! It is not smooth!! If you wrap your hair around and try to pull the iron, your hair will hesitate on the velvet and burn or create kinks. My hair is already straight and now this is a complete waste of money for me. Does anyone want to buy it for 10.00? I guess it's just good for straightening."
2,Does not deserve such a high average rating.,"I have a lot of hair, but it is baby fine with very little volume. I purchased this iron because it had received so many 5 star reviews. While the iron heats up quickly, my hair seems to wave in every direction and become very static-y. Also, my hair gets snagged and pulled out by this iron at almost every pass. I bought this one to replace my old one, which was curved but becoming discolored and smelling like burning. I have had to just go back to using my old one because I just don't like this new one. I wish I could return it."
4,"Happy with its performance so far, but questioning its quality...","In the beginning this straightener was my dream straightener, hot and speedy. It still doesn't take very much time to straighten my hair... but I've noticed that it is becoming slower and slower. I've only had my straightener since October (I've had it for about 4 months now), so it shouldn't be slowing down... but maybe it's just going through a phase. It still makes my hair silky straight, so I'm happy with its effect on my hair, I'm just wondering if it's of good, durable quality?"
5,Totally Enamored!,"I just received this today and did a first test run. I love this iron. I have short hair with a wave and a cowlick and now you can't them at all. Works just as well as the salons hair straighteners. Heats up super fast and leaves hair feeling smooth and soft.When you first turn it on it does have a metallic smell, but that is just for the first time. I can't recommend this product enough. Why buy a CHI for $100-200 when you can get one that is just as good for a much better price?"
1,Defective?,"Not sure if the flat iron that I received was defective, however, a week after receiving this it started making a weird static sound once it was turned on. Not something you want to hear from an electrical appliance! It would also heat inconsistently. Item was return to Amazon!"
2,Not Very Gentle,"I don't care for this Flat Iron. I have coarse, colored hair that is very tough and usually sustains heat just fine... With that in mind, I cranked up the temp on this iron and fried a nice chunk off the front of my bangs. LOVELY. I like HOT irons, like the one my stylist uses at the Salon, however that is a much gentler heat, assuming because it is a higher quality iron. Next time I will research this out more prior to purchasing. Granted this was not all that expensive. I would NOT recommend this iron if you have fine or brittle hair as I believe it would do much irreversible damage."
1,Bad hair do,"I really didn't care for this product, it didn't do what others have said. it didn't slide as easy and caused lots of fly away hair. Would not buy this product at all"
2,Not too happy I paid that much for it,"I'll sum up the only flaw that matters. Its ability to return to 0 bevel.The way the bevel detent/lock works is when you flip the lock actually bends a piece of steel up to release. With lock engaged that piece of steel still flexes and lets the bevel move over 1 degree. This is a real pain when you want to cut crown angled against the fence and base, or cutting trim vertical against the fence.Rough in carpentry is about all that i would recommend this saw for."
2,Don't buy DEWALT718 miter saw,"I ordered this saw after reading good and bad reviews, hoping that the bad reviews were unfounded. Well they're not! The detent locking system for the dual bevel tilt consists of 3 pieces of adjustable metal plates. They were hard to adjust, one of the adjusting screws stripped out the aluminum threading and even when locked in and tightened down there was play in the saw when pressure added, causing a different angled then wanted cut. The sliding system was not smooth. The dust collector was basically useless. Spend your money on something else. I would not recommend buying this saw."
1,dw718,"I bought this saw when my dw708 went in for service and I couldn't be without a saw for two weeks. The blade sits so far forward it cuts on the upsweep of the blade and it breaks small trim ie. cabinet scribe, bed mold, stop etc. The blade gaurd is so big that you can't see the blade until your about to cut, it also gets caught up alot when you're bringing down the head of the saw to cut. There are other things but they were covered in other reviews, I would like to know how that guy got his money back from Dewalt. Needless to say I hate the saw and fear buying anything else from dewalt for the same reasons."
4,Fine product,Great saw...always works well for me. Powerful and easy to use. Blade changes are quick and easy too. Highly recommend.
4,Almost perfect,"After using this product for a couple builds & reading most of the reviews, I must agree that it is almost a perfect saw. Yes, the dust collector is a joke & the cord can get in the way but, once you put a real blade on it...it is a great tool. I use the Freud blade for laminate instead of the contractor series from Dewalt. The cuts are smooth & chip free. Lots of power from the motor. Didn't even slowed it down with a 2.5"" thick cut in MDF. The cut settings are right on & with the additional work table (you build it) a 16"" rip is unmatched by other saws. With the extension piece & positive stop attached, this is a very accurate saw. Don't like lasers too much so I didn't buy or try to mount it. I am confident that I will get many years of quality use from this saw..."
2,Quality Reduction,"So here's my story.I've owned the previous model (708 dual bevel sliding miter) for about 7 years and loved that saw. Great quality blade, great cut, dead on. The saw was heavy duty metal that did what it was supposed to. I got a little greedy when I saw some of the features on the new 718 model like the bevel presets and laser capability.Here are the complaints... First of all. With the old 708 you could grab the handle anywhere to depress the blade. The first time I grabbed the handle and depressed the blade on this new 718, the plastic blade guard swung up and sliced the skin off my thumb. I cannot believe that made it through product testing. Second issue is just general quality of construction and materials. The 718 is such lightweight low quality aluminum that I cannot believe it will stand the test of time. Honestly, it is hard for me to accept that both these saws came from the same company.It is sad what Dewalt has let happen to their product quality."
4,Accurate and usefull yet table too small,"I have owned a Delta DW718 for a bit under a year now. I have few of the complaints that the people giving 3 stars or below have, with the exception of the bed size and upward stroke at the back of the cut. The DW718 cuts accurately with the slides locked or unlocked. It has no problem powering through hardwoods. Setup for any compound angle seems to only take seconds (a few minutes if you run a test piece). The adjustable fences are wonderful for ensuring that you have proper support behind molding or thicker woods.I like this saw a lot. I just wish the bed were a bit larger and I did not have to use a sacrificial strip of wood to minimize tear out on the top of the piece being cut.I have made several rough and fine wood projects with the aid of this saw and would recommend it to anyone that needs its features."
2,DW718 Not a finish saw,"If you are going to build furniture, cabinets that sort of thing. STAY AWAY! There is way to much play in the cut! The initial chop cut is smooth but when you slide the blade back it leaves anywhere from a 64th to a 32nd inch lip in the wood. As previous reviewers found the dust collection is a joke even hooked up to a vac. This is definitely not the one!"
5,Dewalt compound miter say,This is the saw to have when you are building your house. It has 60 degree cuts for like stairs and so easy to use and very powerful. for the money you will never find one like this for the price.
2,DeWalt AND Defect are synonomous,"I have owned several Dewalt tools ALL of which have failed within one year. I am a tool freak so I buy many of them to use within the remodeling industry. DeWalt tools are colored yellow which means ""CAUTION""!I will never buy another DeWalt tool as long as Bosch, Porter-Cable, and Rigid are around. My Rigid miter saw works great!"
2,Dissappointed,"I usually thought of Dewalt as a good American or European product. But after recieving my DW718 saw and the stand for it I was extremely dissappointed, the saw was made in Mexico and the stand in China. I came very close to sending it back. No more Dewalt for me, they can keep their Chineese and Mexican junk. Selling at american made prices, and made at 30 cent an hour labor--sickning. I don't look at them as Dewalt products, I look at them as cheap Mexican and Chineese products."
1,Very Dissapointed,I was excited to receive my new Dewalt saw. While making some test cuts to align the laser add-on I noticed the saw did not cut square or perpendicular as much as 1.5 degrees out. I never expected to have to set up a new saw before I could use it.
3,Lacks power,I have used the Dewalt miter saw for years and thought I would try the dual bevel sliding model. It seems to lack the power of the older regular miter saw.
1,Disappointed,"I've used a DW708 for finish carpentry for years and have been satisfied. However, the Dw718 is a different story. The biggest issues for me was the rough slide and inaccuracy. Others I know industry agree that DeWalt let us down with this saw. Get a Bosch or Hitachi. I hear the Makitas are nice too."
2,Good Size Capacity but everything else sux!,"I bought this about a year ago and I will tell you one thing. DONT BUY IT. Yes, it does have a good capacity but everything else is terrible. The dust collection is terrible (even before mine broke off after 2 days). DeWalt used to be known for fantastic product quality but this one went down the drain."
4,DEWALT DW718 Heavy-Duty 15 Amp 12-Inch Dual Bevel Sliding Compound Miter saw,Very smooth and powerful enough to do most of my wood cutting. Reasonable price. Look forward to finding out long term performance.
3,"DeWalt 12"" saw","I owned 3 of these saws and the blade is really big, so big in fact it would warp during cutting so if you need a trim saw this is not the one I would recommend."
5,JUST WHAT I NEEDED,I have been using this saw for the last five weekends on a home repair project and it is just what I needed. It goes through 2x12's like a hot knife through butter. It is heavy so you need to purchase a folding stand with wheels to move it around and set it up on the work site easily.
1,useless dust collector,"not worth the money, will never buy saw from dewalt again.read all 1 star reviews, agree with them l00%.I should have read reviews before I bought this junk.inaccurate, nonfunctional dust collector(extremely annoying),poor slider stopper, who designed this piece of trash. hated it."
1,Sony AAA rechargable,"I needed some more rechargables and decided I would try shopping thru Amazon as for the last several years I have been extremely pleased with my purchaces. Well, I should have stayed with the supplier I had been using as this time I spent more per battery and after testing, 2/3 of the batteries purchased couldn't supply even half of the rated capacity of 900 mAh. 2 of the 8 supplied 800 the other 6 supplied barely 300. This testing takes 72 hrs to complete and I did it twice because I couldn't believe the results of the first test. I would NOT reccomend spending your hard-earned dollars on these Sony batteries."
2,Faulty Product,I can't fairly assess these batteries because half of them were defective. I tested them in my brand new battery charger and only four of them registered. I thought it was my chargers fault so I switched the spots multiple times and those batteries that were registered defective still registered as that in different slots. Annoying
1,not working correctly,"I bought the lcd charger along with these batteries. I'm not sure if it's the batteries or the charger, but they are not working well together. battery life is horrible compared to my old battery recharger/chargeable batteries. these only last a few days and they need to be recharged which takes hours then they don't even fully charge or it states it's fully charged when they clearly are not. very confused and disappointed on both these products. if anyone has help or experienced this as well, please comment. thanks"
5,The Best Rechargeables Ever!,These Sony NiMH batteries rock! They hold a charge much longer than most rechargeables do.
4,Just above average rechargeables,"These sony batteries work as you would expect out of any average rechargeable. Nothing special about them so far out of about 20 cycles I've gone through. I've notice they don't hold the charge for a long time so use the batteries right after charging. Having them sit around unused after a fresh charge for about 2 weeks made them last for only 70% of the normal time.If you are looking for a higher performing rechargeable battery that has a longer shelf life, look into the eneloops from sanyo."
2,They're a little too big for some items that need AAAs,"These charge and work fine, but won't fit into my Logitech cordless keyboard. Another rechargeable brand (Uniross) does, as do regular AAA Duracells that I used before I went to rechargeables."
3,"IT DOESN'T LAST A LOT THE LOAD, THERE ARE ECONOMIC MA AND OF BETTER QUALITY","IT DOESN'T LAST A LOT THE LOAD, THERE ARE ECONOMIC MA AND OF BETTER QUALITY"
4,Works fine,"Te ahorraras algunos dólares si usas este tipo de pils frecuentemente. Las pilas funcionan bien, eso si no son para siempre.You'll save some money if you use this kind of batteries. I recommend this item."
1,Battery Life,"I bought these for my wife to use in her Digital Voice Recorder she uses for school. I really hate disposable batteries so I thought it was worth it. Normally she can record about 2 hours of audio on her recorder and listen to it for 8 hours. Fully charged, these batteries died in less than 1 hour."
1,"Cannot hold charge, get eneloop instead","I have used sanyo eneloop's for a few years, but thought I'd try these sony's because they claim to be 900mAh (vs. the 750-800mAh eneloop's).The eneloop's will last 10-11 hours in my MP3, but the Sony's last anywhere from 8 minutes to 50 minutes. We've charged them 4 times with the same result. If the vendor will not take them back, we will throw them out, it's just too much hassle to change batteries in the middle of exercising, etc. all the time. Our charger is a Panasonic BQ-390, which is an excellent smart charger.Don't waste your time with these Sony batteries."
3,Loses Charge quickly,I bought these AAA batteries for use in electric toothbrush. The toothbrush takes 2 batteries. The batteries did not last very long. They last about half as long as the Alkaline batteries would last. I was not impressed at all given these are brand new and fully charged.
2,disappointed in a name brand like Sony,I was hoping for a better product. They dont stay charged for more than a couple weeks the duracell batteries are much better
5,Sony batteries,"Sony rechargeibles (AA & AAA) have always given me excellent service. If your need is critical, they are top choice."
2,Not impressed,"Save your money if your looking for long battery life, the only good thing about these batteries is that you can recharge them so you can get disappointed over and over again. What really gets me about these things is I will charge them and Oh...by the way it takes about 6 HOURS to charge a pair of these things...anyway I will put them in my TV remote and get about 2 to 3 days of use out of them...and I am not even talking about using the remote that much...anyway just as you find yourself needing to change the channel or mute or un-mute the TV well you find yourself in a frantic race to find batteries cause you can't control the TV...of course if your not on the chronic then you will realize that you can get up and hit the buttons on your TV...but then again a lot of TV's don't give you that option so you are out of luck."
4,Save the planet (and your money)!,"If you have tons of gadgets (like me :-)), rechargeable batteries are a must have companion to them."
2,Maybe I got duds?,"Or maybe my Harmony 650 remote just sucks the life out of any battery within a matter of days. I charged the batteries up in my Sony charger, popped them in my remote, and now I believe 6 days later, the remote is prompting me to change the batteries... I will try them in another product to see if its the batteries or the electronic. On another note my AA Sony rechargeable batteries are awesome in my digital camera, they last for well over 2000 shots.(which is why i bought these)"
3,Battery drain fast and inconsistent,Out of the 4 batteries in the pack two of them drain its charge extremely fast. The other two seems to hold charge much longer.
5,Sony Rechargeable AAA 900 mAh NiMH Batteries,I ordered these AAA batteries for use with my new SONY Battery Charger. These batteries last for a long time. I'm using them in my universal remote control.
3,not very powerful,"I bought these AAA batteries but haven't tried them. However, I used AA ones that came with Sony charger. I charged them full and used them for my digital camera but they lasted for only 6-7 shots with flash whereas I used regular batteries with this camera for taking VDOs before."
1,shipping problems,"I can't comment on the batteries themselves because I never received them. I ordered them in combination with the Sony charger and when I opened the box, the packing slip listed them as being present, but only the charger was in box. I emailed Amazon customer support and they quickly apologized and reordered the batteries at no cost. When that box arrived, the packing slip was the only thing in there. Amazon had shipped an empty box! I again contacted customer support and requested a refund, which they quickly granted. So something went wrong during the shipping process and I never received the batteries. I ended up picking up a package of Energizer batteries in-store and those work fine with the charger and my electronics."
1,rechargeable batteries without a charge.,i may be naive or something but i would have thought that the batteries would start out with a charge. this is my first time buying rechargeable batteries so i don't know if all of them need to be charged before using but for the price that they are it would have been nice if they would be ready to use right away instead of having to charge them first.
4,A nice follow up to CHUNG KUO,"Having fallen in love with Chung Kuo: The Middle Kingdom, I sought this book out with high expectations. Wingrove delievers again: well-planned characters in a rich future world where China rules. It seemed to me that Wingrove has definately read up on the philosophy, language and culture he has based Chung Kuo's society on.Not to spoil it for anyone, but I will say this: I have read and own the entire series. This one is a keeper."
5,IRWIN MULTI-SCREWDRIVER,"I have used other brands and found that the Irwin 9-in-1 is the best. I work overseas as an electrician. I need to buy 3 at a time (shipping is free then)because all the local nationals want one. I pass them out as gifts. I have never worn one out, they just disappear."
2,Go With Klein!!!!,Seems well made except for one glaring problem...metal ferrule almost always pulls out of plastic handle when removing shaft to turn it around. This makes the tool all but unusable unless you use it for spare bits for your Klein multi-screwdriver.
3,Nice Grip..,"An Ok Screwdriver..I've tried the Klein 9 in 1,10 in 1, Greenlee 9 in 1, and the Irwin 9 in 1.Out of all them Klein 9 in 1 seemed to be the best.Irwin 9 in 1.Pros+ nice rubbery grip.+ bits stay in places easy to changeCons+ Flat bit broke from less then 2 months use.+ Does not have star bits.Conclusion.Cheap? bought 2 of these I kept one and gave one to a friend will see how long it will last.So far I haven't had any luck with Irwin.They should stick with bits."
2,Rusted after a month of use.,"It does not hold up well. I use it as my daily tool and it's not going to survive. I love the multi tool aspect of it, but i got a little water on it (plumbing work) and now it's all rusted up. That's unacceptable. Also the philips screwdriver is wearing down and I'm almost losing ability to use it. Look elsewhere...and please leave a comment and let me know what tool is better than this one so I can buy it.."
3,PRICE IS TOO HIGH,"I find the price for this CD too high, it should be in the range of $19.95 but not more than that, but the price you are asking is way over the real price of this CD.You should review this matter and put a price that is acceptable."
5,Fantastic,"This product is exactly as described. Delicious, and crave-filling dark chocolate; not too sweet. I love having these around the house."
5,88% Endangered Species Chocolate,"Excellent product.It is so tasty.By purchasing it,I am helping to preserve wildlife as well.Please continue to have it available for a long time."
5,Like a Glass of Wine,"Just wanted to add my vote for this as the best extreme dark chocolate I've tried. It really isn't for those who are expecting sweet dark chocolate. Like those who posted 1-star reviews of ""Yuk!"", I made the mistake the first time of snapping off a row and chomping down on a piece... what a shock to the tastebuds! But there was -something- there, so I didn't throw it out. I simply nibbled on the rest of it, and what a difference! It was suddenly just sweet enough, with an intense, very satisfying chocolate flavor. The ""extreme"" in the bar's name isn't there for exaggeration! So if you want something more like a nice glass of wine to be savored slowly rather than a glass of grape juice to be chugged, give this bar a try."
5,The BEST dark chocolate!,"I haven't found the dark chocolate yet that is too dark for me, except perhaps unsweetened! This chocolate is really dark(88% cocoa) but really smooth and yummy! It is my favorite so far!"
1,i love dark chocolate but not this!,"I was really looking forward to this dark chocolate after reading the other reviews, but I found it to be very dry and not smooth at all. I would NOT buy this again!"
1,"Very Disappointing - bland,sweet and dry","Being a great fan of 85% plus chocolate I was excited to try this 88% product. What a disappointment! It manages the remarkable feat of being bland at 88%! It lacks flavour (tastes like extremely cheap chocolate), has a poor, dry mouth feel and is overly sweet. I suspect the presence of Soy Lechtin is not helping. It is very light in colour compared with similar strength chocolate - again amazingly so for a claimed 88% bar. If you only eat 85% plus chocolate then it is unlikely you will enjoy this chocolate :-("
2,Ruined by heat,"I was keen to know what this chocolate tastes like though unfortunately when it arrived it was clear it had melted sometime during shipping which changed the structure and turned a bunch of it back into cocoa powder. I'm rather disappointed that it barely tastes edible and as a fan of really dark chocolate I'm doubtful that's how they're supposed to taste.By contrast I ordered theGhirardelli Chocolate Intense Dark Chocolate Bars, 86% Cacao Midnight Reverie, 3.17 oz.and was rather confused by the higher shipping costs. I figured out why when they arrived. They'd been shipped with special freezer packs and bubble wrapped. The freezer packs kept the chocolate from melting and they arrived in perfect condition."
5,Too much like Baking Choc.,"As far as choc. goes this really good. But someone who reviewed should have explained it is so close to baking choc. you can't hardly tell the difference. Since I bought this I have experminted, and between 60 and 70 % is good for a dark chocalate lover.Randy"
3,"Great chocolate, melted delivery","I love this chocolate, and have bought it local stores. However, when it arrived on my doorstep, it was a giant melted mess. I have ordered chocolate from several companies, and all of them refrigerated the chocolate in some way for delivery. Buy it in the store."
5,"A brilliant collection of cartoons, in a delicious chocolate shell","This book reminds me of things I secretly wish I could do in real life. If you ever get stranded on a desert island and can only take one book with you...it should probably be about survival, or how to build a raft, or something like that. But if you can bring two books, then take this one, too. For people who like their humor very smart, I find it hard to think of much else that's anywhere near this funny."
2,$70 for shipping???,"I didn't buy this case. I'm just pointing out that at the time of this review the shipping for this product is $70. Be sure to be aware of how much the shipping is before you buy it, you don't want to end up paying about $100 without even knowing...The case itself LOOKS nice, but I haven't gotten it. I'm just reviewing about the shipping cost."
3,Expected better..,"I really expected this case to be a little sturdier. It feels like cardboard with a layer of plush fabric on the inside for protection, but I guess you get what you pay for. There's also no extra space in the case for anything besides the guitar, like some cases have a compartment for a tuner or capo. I wouldn't trust this case with a guitar worth more than $300."
4,A easy listening Italian CD,"A lot of acoustic guitar and the soft soothing voice of Ron Costa makes this a very easy listening CD. A lot of the songs sound similar, Track 4, Parliamo un Po Dite, is beautiful with the children's choir as backup."
5,It's a wonderful book.,I was touched by the pictures and the words which work so well together. It's very moving - a wonderful book.
5,Great Teen Read - by daughter of reviewer,"My mom who is the author of The Birth to Five Book: Confident Childrearing Right from the Start gave me this novel to read.I'm a teenager who is sick of uninteresting, shallow novels with vulgarity slipped in. Night Song was a refreshing change! I was glad to find a book that was funny, sad, had good characters, good messages and a clean read. There's a subtle Christian message but the author did not beat religion into this book.Night Song isn't just one story but offers four different plots that come together at the end. You read about a nazi, a Jewish boy in a concentration camp, an Austrian woman whose in the resistance movement, and her American financee who is trying to find her.It took me only a week to read this fascinating book. I highly recommend this excellent novel and look forward to more by Tricia Goyer. We need more like this one."
1,NOT A JAY STRONGWATER!!!!,"This frame shows up as one of the first search results when you type ""Strongwater"" as your search. Somehow this seller get this frame listed under this search. The seller then conveniently does not mention that this frame is actually an ""Ashley Manor"" manufactured copy a a Jay Strongwater that has been manufactured in CHINA!!!!!!!Buyer Beware!!!!!!"
5,Better than expected!!!,This toy is just amazing :) I did not expect it to have 22 phrases plus the Wish for a Fish Song. It is a MUST have for all collectors
5,Works great,"I purchased this adapter because we only have 1 phone line in the house and also only 1 phone jack. In order to plug in the phone line, the DSL line, and the home security line into the phone jack, I needed something like this; this little gadget fit the bill perfectly. Have had it plugged into the phone jack with 3 lines running to it, and have never experienced any problems whatsoever. Would recommend if you're in a predicament similar to mine."
5,Exactly What I Needed,"The previous reviews got my attention and this was exactly what I needed and hoped for. I had connected my Ooma to a 5 handset cordless but also wanted to connect it to my business phone which had all my presets, etc. I connected this item directly to the Ooma and then 1 to the cordless and 1 to the business 2 line phone. Works perfectly."
5,Good Item,Replaced a cheaper version that consistently gave me problems. Very pleased with this. No problems so far.
1,Causes Noise on the Voice Line,"Summary - Do not buy this if voice quality matters.Background - This was purchased to plug into the single port of a Cable Voice Modem and split the line for the voice and the FAX.Detail - The FAX worked fine, but the Voice had a lot of static, so much that you could not understand what was being said.Recommendation - I would not recommend this."
2,Not as advertised...,"...not GE-branded, not branded at all; not GE-packaged, in a clear plastic bag; not a TL26131, no markings; not white,(ugly)tan; not the same shape, more square; deceptive, not trustworthy..."
1,Missing Case and different weights,"Shipping was a little slow and when I received it, it didn't bring the storage case. the shipping box was broken because of the weight and the post office had to rig it. Very dissapointed because I bought this so it could be stored under my son's bed. Also the set was not the one advertise on the picture and I received a plastic set which it is cheaper that the one advertised."
5,Electronic Scale,"I own the Soehnle scale that looks like a flying saucer (recommended by Cook's Illustrated magazine). Frankly, this Salter is better--smaller footprint and oz. to grams easily--so now I give it to my cooking friends for presents."
1,Returned!,"Ordered this scale with high hopes after reading positive reviews here on Amazon and elsewehere on the web about Salter's reputation for accuracy Not to mention that I liked the look of the scale. Unfortunately, the scale was DOA! Hit On/Zero button and would just default to all dashes ------, tried adding weight, removing weight and nothing happened. Battery reset and still the same result, time to send this back. I am not pleased to say the least. =("
1,0 stars for scale but 5 stars for amazon for prompt refund,Three of these were ordered as gifts. What an embarassing situation. All were defective and all were design flawed. I don't know how one would put 11 pounds on it without it breaking into pieces. Poorly conceived and made worse.
4,Couldn't live without it!,"This scale is a foodies dream. We owned the same one in England but lost it on the move home. So we bought another! It takes up little space and can be stood up on its side because it is square--for storage. The ease of transition between grams and lbs / oz is really 1 touch of a button. I like the ability to zero out with an empty bowl from your kitchen on it and then measure flour, etc usng the same bowl. The batteries last quite a while. If you're in the market for a kitchen scale...look no further."
3,"Great Scale, but it broke","The glass didn't break like some other folks mentioned, but the crescent-shaped front section (with the read out and the buttons) came loose and just broke off. Too bad, because otherwise, it's great - accurate and consistent.It was past 30 days, so I couldn't return it to Amazon. But once I finally found the corporate site (www.salterhousewares.com), I was able to get in touch with them, they were incredibly nice and quick, and they are sending a replacement scale. Hopefully this one won't break."
4,Salter 1001 11-Pound Square Glass Kitchen Scale,"The scale is a very nice appliance to display in any kitchen. It works every bit as good as the advertising says it will, easy to use and accurate. The only problem I have with it is, the weight is in 1/8 ounce increments, but an instrument to weigh in 1/100 ounce increments would cost five times more. All said, this is a fine piece of machinery."
2,Broken in less than 1 year,"My Salter 1001 scale started having problems within 3 months and broke within 10 months. I am sending the scale back to Saltier for replacement. A good scale while it worked, but what pain this has become."
5,Great accessory,Good accessory for any kitchen. Small footprint. Can be stored almost anywhere. Ability to change from English to Metric great for European recipies. Very sensitive. Good also for determining postage on letters and small packages.
4,More ethereal beauty,"More ethereal beauty from the Church. If you like the Church, especially their later work, you'll enjoy this album. I am late to the Church party, but I'm hooked! The most underrated, overlooked bank out there!"
4,Good effort...worth picking up,"Definitely better than Sometime Anywhere. While it's not as immediately satsifying as Starfish or Gold Afternoon Fix, this CD does grow on you. I'm listening to it for the first time in about a month, and I'm really enjoying it. I think what hurts this album is that the first song might be its weakest. There are some gems in the middle. I love Tranquility."
5,Mystic and Surreal - Pure Heaven,"You ever have one of those days when the world seems all to crushing?.. This is the cure. Hologram Of Baal is again another beautiful release from one of the most underated bands in the world. I could dissect song by song for you but that would take away all the fun in your own exploration of this fine piece of work. I can tell you this though, with each listening it will embed itself into your soul. ""Gotta escape the blues man don't cha know"" ""She takes ya places your heart can not go"" Enjoy...this one it's Smoooooth"
5,Stunning addition to an already otherworldly discography,I heard this CD on a late-night radio show in its entirety and was quite impressed. I just put in my order for it. It is much better than ANYTHING that you usually hear these days. God bless those honest Christian boys who learned how not to bend over and take it up the #%% from the record company brass!!
4,Another great album from the most creative band ever...EVER.,"13 albums later and they're still amazing. It's nice to see them spewing forth some catchier tunes this album. Hologram is a 50 minute vacation captured on disk. No need to snort, shoot, or swallow....just sit down and hit play."
4,A welcome return to form.,"After two nondescript albums, ""Sometime,Anywhere"" and ""Magician Among The Spirits"", the Church returns to its former glory with Peter Koppes back as a full fledged member. ""Anaethesia"" is a great opening track. Tim Powles' drumming and production are very instrumental in the success of this album. ""Louisiana"" is easily the best single the band has released since ""Under The Milky Way"". This is the first album since ""Priest=Aura"" that I make sure I listen to in its entirety. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I think a band should only have one 5 star album. That album would be ""Priest=Aura"" for me, but Hologram comes very close. I look forward to more albums from the band with Tim Powles at the production helm."
3,Hyperposeable Superman Soars,Very nice figure. There are lots of poseability options.This is a great figure for kids and collectors alike.
3,"Eh.. uh..ummm, well it is his first book...","I wanted to give it a 2.5 but that wasn't an option so I rounded up. I'm not really sure where to begin. I read this book on the recommendation of a lady at the nail shop, she raved about how great it was. I unfortunately have to agree with many of the other reviewers. Underdeveloped characters, pointless references and too many typos. Triple Crown does not proofread which is obvious, but aside from that the ending was so improbable. The manner in which the story was told was confusing, it was relayed from his view, her view the past and the present, simultaneously. It wasn't HORRIBLE but I would not recommend it."
1,Come On People.....This Book Was Underdeveloped,"I love to read all types of novels but come on this could have been a better story but between the errors and the story never developing I would recommend that no one purchases this book. I only read it to the end because I didn't want to waste 15.00 dollars. Then at the end the author tells you how the story was not true of course it wasn't true and anybody who thinks it is better check their lightbulb in their brain.WHAT A WASTE OF CASH FO"" REAL PEEPS."
3,Liked It,"It was a good read aside from the grammatical errors and whatnot. I didn't like how the author kept flipping back and forth between Javon and Sonya's lunch date and Javon's past. Also when making phone calls the Ring, Ring, Ring grew annoying. That part was like an elementary school student writing for the first time. And the ending=unrealistic.And for all women I do not like how Sonya was portrayed. She was self-proclaimed as ""That bitch"" but her behavior towards Javon was clingy and demanding.In a nutshell though, a good read."
3,So...So...So...,"At first this book started off okay, but in some parts of the book seemed sort of confusing, because of the grammatical errors. When I got through half of the book I wanted to give it up, but I wanted to keep on reading it to see what's gonna happen between Bilal and Jovan. As for Sonya she's a ride or die ""hood rat."" Better yet, I'm happy that I finished the book some times through the book I was yawning losing contact with book....all in all great book...."
3,Wasn't special,"Now ive read a few ""ghetto"" books and each had something new and dramatic to bring to the table...this book was good but it was so good that I could bragg to people to go out and buy...not enough detail was given and things weren't told out good enough...this book could have had some revisen before being published so it could be that 5 star book it should b...i recommend that people go to the library instead of buying this book"
5,TCP DOING BIG THANGS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,THIS BOOK WAS OFF DA HOOK I READ IT WHILE I WAS ON MY WAY TO DIRTY JERZ FOR VACATION AND FINISHED IT IN 8 HRS. TRUST ME U WOULD WANT TO READ IT AND PAY BACKS IS A BIOTCH WHEN A SNITCH TURNS IN THE GAME. THIS BOOK WILL HAVE U WANTING MORE. JASON POOLE U DID IT MAN AND PLEASE BLESS US WITH ANOTHER BOOK
4,Luxor,"The Luxor is located at 3900 Las Vegas Boulevard South Las Vegas Nevada. The Luxor is perhaps one of the most beautiful hotels in the world. Incased inside this magnificent 30 story glass pyramid is a grand Casino, a seven story IMAX theater, a extraordinary auditorium featuring ""The Blue Man Group""(Intel) a huge ballroom, and nearly five thousand rooms. The huge light on top of the Luxor is so bright that it is visible from space. In front of the Luxor is a ten story tall Sphinx which is actually larger that the real Sphinx."
3,Not the orginal recordings,These are not the original recordings.This remake of this music has some of the sound from the originals but with a new age twist to it.If you are looking for the original recordings you might not like this cd.Myself I did enjoy the music and the quality of this cd isn't bad.
2,"Would have been great, except",I received it and it was broken! One of the inside tiers was laying inside of the case. The metal hinges were completely bent. I sent it back immediately and bought a silver one from Target.
1,The Worst CD I've Ever Listened to!,"N'Sync DOES NOT know how to sing and they are not cute at all! When I first bought the album and this single, I thought it was going to be good, but I guess I was wrong. I wasted ""my money"" It was not worth it at all!"
4,A Great Example of a 70's Thriller,"I ordered this book from the library since it's out of print. This is the third or fourth book in the Dolly series, but I couldn't get the others first. My curiosity was piqued because I love Dorothy Dunnett's writing so much. This is as different from the Lymond and Niccolo series as possible, but a really good thriller. Even though the title sounds like a children's book, this book is certainly not that. Dolly is a large yacht and the hero is a bookish, bifocal wearing master spy from Britain MI6. The Bird in this book and the others is girl who gets embroiled with Johnson for some reason or other. This book keeps you guessing right up to the end. It is hard to follow all the way through since the characters are so bright and oh so brittle with their humour, but it's worth persevering with. I would like to continue to read what I can find of this series. It's actually quite a bit of fun."
5,Hilarious and sweet in a painfully awkward and off-beat sort of way.,I absolutely adored this film! It's the story of two totally awkward and unconventional personalities falling in love and trying to figure out how that even works. Jemaine Clement never really disappoints in my opinion and his general grossness throughout the film (because there's really no other way to describe it) ends up being oddly endearing. It's all just wacky and strange and definitely one I'll be buying for my movie collection. If you like movies like this... check out Gentleman Broncos which is in the same thread. In an age where we seem to be inundated with action and horror movies or even the trademark romantic comedy it's so refreshing to see a film that takes you in a completely different direction.
4,Lovely Kiwi Film,This is a great (and typical) Kiwi comedy. The scene with the 'hacker' is priceless! One of the best comedy's to come out of New Zealand in a while.
4,A SAD AND FUNNY QUIRKY FILM!,Just one look at the cover art of the DVD case is enough to let you know this isn't just another movie! The likable cast keeps this sweet little romantic comedy fresh. It's got a Napoleon Dynamite vibe with it's cast of off the wall characters. The main character of Lily is played with honesty and you can't help but feel sorry for her all the while laughing through this quirky little film. It's nice to see a romantic comedy that I didn't know the ending to ten minutes after it started.
4,Random,"If you liked Me And You And Everyone We Know, then you should like this. This is very funny, and sweet and at times creepy. The characters say very random things, sometimes just stupid stuff but it's funny. Not as thought provoking as Miranda July's work but very entertaining nonetheless. It's not a big budget film obviously and some scenes look like a sketch comedy setup, which kinda gives it a true indie feel.If you don't want mainstream, or just looking for something different but not too far out, I would say check it out. It's cool"
5,Eagle vs. shark,"Truly one of my favorite movies of all time. If you are an independent romantic movie lover, this movie is for you!"
3,Meh,"I do like this movie, especially with the Pheonix Foundation rocking it out on the soundtrack. Although, I won't be able to see this movie considering the Blu-ray factor. Not everyone has a Blu-ray player and for one movie, it's not worth it to go out and buy on top of this DVD another system. Sorry."
3,Burned DVD,"I was happy to have received this movie, but when I opened it, the movie was a burned copy for a public library. It was a done fairly well, but I didn't have any indication that it was going to be a burned copy.Oh well, it's a great movie."
3,Quirky fun,"A quirky little comedy from New Zealand. Two social misfits try dating, showing that there's someone for everyone out there, I guess. Think 'Napoleon Dynamite' loser, and you have the basic idea. Funny once, but not sure it would stand up to repeated watching."
2,Ford escort cabriolet SI 1994,"I'm trying to buy a Repair Manual, could you please help me where I can buy this item?"
2,Very Thin Pearl Bracelet,The fresh water pearl bracelet was a great deal but is very thin in person. I would recommend buying it as a first bracelet for a lil girl.
1,4mm cultural pearls bracelet,As a previous customer of Silver Speck I purchased 3 sets of 4 mm cultural pearls and a Genuine Amethyst Peridot Citrine Crystal Chip Bracelet. I have been so pleased with my earlier orders I was not suprised that the chip bracelet was stunning and loved by my daughter on her birthday.It was then with much suprised to find the cultured pearls were 2mm not 4mm as advertised. I wrote to Silver Speck and received a reply from Brenda that the pearls were 4mm but if I was unhappy that I could return them and my account would be credited with in 5-10 days.I wrote back that the time involved and cost of mailing was not worth the cost and that they indeed were 2mm and sent a photo of the pearls next to a set of 4 mm pearls laid on a metric ruler.She replied the same as before.I see no reason why they should not pay for the shipping as it was their (error?) mistake.It is a sad way to end an business relationship.
1,Interesting topic - awful read,"Having travelled to India, I was excited to pick this book up. Unfortunately the book is barely readable. The character development is poor and the constant flashbacks seem unnecessary and annoying. Lacks any element of a good thriller. One of the few books fit for the trash."
5,My boys LOVE these puzzles!,"We have had this box of puzzle for over two years and both of my sons (ages 4.5 & 2) love them. They are not too hard, but also not too easy. They both like to do them in sequence (fire truck, then police car, etc) and we can do them all in 15 minutes. They are not the traditional rectangular shape, so it makes them more interesting. My kids love puzzles and are pretty good at them, and these are their favorites. They will even pick these puzzles over watching TV!They have held up REALLY well, especially considering that they are cardboard and my kids are rough with their toys. I put each puzzle in its own ziploc bag so the pieces don't get all mixed up. Although it might be fun to mix all the pieces together and see if they can build all 4 at once."
4,product review,"It was pretty funny. Moms Mabley is a GREAT ACTRESS! Even though it's in Black&White, the content/message is what reaches you."
3,Moms,"Even though Moms Mabley had a major role, it took several times for me to watch it until I watched it all the way through. Once I saw the performances, that made up for the silly beginning, which was hard to get past before."
1,Not much of a story line.,"Skip to the last couple of chapters where the talent is displayed. That's the only thing worth watching. (The rating reads ""I hate it."") That language is too strong. I just didn't like it."
5,Ray's Kitchen,"If you can find this book on Amazon or wherever you can find it, buy it! I purchased mine on Amazon and it was in better condition than I expected. The price was reasonable and received it as promised."
4,No one has a monopoly on suffering,"It would seem that the world has been held hostage thinking one group or another deserves more because they have suffered more than anyone else. Our history books have misinformed us and downright lied about the experiences of so many people as if they did not exist. When we speak of genocide the first thing ringing in our ears is the Holacaust in Germany and what happened to 6 million Jews. What about the 20 million Armenians on April 24,1919 (or thereabouts). What about 9 million Africans drowned in the Middle Passage. How about the annihilation and almost termination of the indigineous people of the Americas. The importance of this book lies in taking a factual, first person, look at the other resident citizens of Germany who were also issued a death penalty under Nazi rule. Hopefully knowing the world wide experience of Genocide (still going on), we as people of the world can stop it."
2,"Necessary, but not particularly inspiring","A book of this kind has long been needed. Friedman attempts to cover all the main victim groups although she was not successful in finding Survivors from all groups. Gay victims, for example, are mentioned but there is no account of an individual. Although the accounts are described as ""first-person stories"", they are all retold in Friedman's rather dull writing style which gives a sense of unity at the expense of expressing divergence. It would have been much more effective to have heard the Survivor's own accounts rather than Friedman's retellings of their stories. Overall, the book comes accross as a text book. Useful for teaching, but unlikely to be read without adult coercion."
3,The other victums.,I thought this book wa very interesting. This is the first time I have ever read a book like this it pretty good at first it was not that interesting I actual got a little bord of it it was not exciting. Untill I got to the part where the little boy was talking about his family and how they were together for a long time. But when Hitler came a long he was sending families a art and away to concentration camps. Lucky for the little boy he went to the same camp as them. All the people from that camp got in a line and was counted down to either 3 or 4 whoever got 3 or 4 was taken away. His family was not taken once again he was lucky. That was my favorite part of the whole book.
3,The Marksmen Grip rocks!!,"I got this grip and it has been very useful. First of all, it gives you a better grip, and shows you about where your blade is gonna land. The only badpart about this is tha your opponent knows about where your blade is gonna land. Get this for beginners and continue using it. (hint: for the ultimate endurance blade, get metal draciel, dragoon fighter, & seaborg 2 or trygle. use da metal draciel base da dragoon fighter attack ring and the trygle or seaborg 2 weight disk.) remember: LET IT RIP!!!"
5,Great for large hands.,"I love this launcher if only for the size. I have large hands and most of the other launchers just don't feel comfortable in my hands but this one feels just right. The light is useless to me though, I would remove if I knew if it would still be tournament legal. Regardless of that ome small thing this is an excellent launcher."
5,This is a great book!,"This is a great book full of action, adventure, and suspense. My favorite part is when Kate goes to Gashra's mountain to retrieve the Broken Touchstone. Readers of any age will enjoy this woundrous tale."
5,Read this book!,"You should definately read this book. It has action, adventure, and suspense. The book has everything a great book should have. Readers of all ages will enjoy this book."
3,My thoughts on The Ancient One,"Overall, I felt it was an incredible experience. I find myself often reading Barron's books because of the adventure and fantasy involved. Though this book expressed all of the characteristics of a Barron book, it tended to a have a weaker ending than the others. Throughout the story the plot thickens and the climax builds but the build was so extreme during the story that it outshined the ending. The villain was just not creepy enough in detail and was fought to easily. There wasn't enough struggle.Leaving the ending very abrupt.But then I relized what Barron was trying to get the reader to notice. That one should revel in the experience and not how this particular story ends. Yes, the tree is lost but the experience he takes the reader through is forever encompassed in our minds."
5,This is one of my favs!!,"I love this book! I just finished reading it yesterday morning (12:48 AM). Even though it was somewhat predictable, and had some flaws, it shared a definate message about environment, both metaphorically and just straight at you. Definately worth buying."
3,A simple story...,"A fairly simple story with all your basic plot needs. I feel that certain elements of the book (such as how Kate and her Aunt Melonie feel about nature) were overdone. The sense of all things in life 'connected' with each other was repeated several times, without too much syntax variation. The ""big bad villian meanie"" was described almost as well as I just did.And I didn't really like the way it ended, but I won't give it away. It just seemed somewhat anticlimatic.Anyway, there's nothing seriously /wrong/ with this book, it just didn't appeal to me."
4,"Excellent textures, but productivity is a little below good.","it's small, nice, slick, and eye-catching! however, casio is pretty new to 'camera' business therefore, the quality of the lens may not be up to those like sony, cannon, nikon,etc. The Ex-S2 is nice, allowing users to manually operate the camera on flash and shutter sensitivity. The joy-stick is a little too small but bearable, not too many functions (menu wise) but moderate for those who doesn't consider themselves - professionals. Then this would be fine, excellent portability, download is easy; the cradle does all the work and the program actually sited for user's (arrangement) on which date and keeps track of how many times u download pictures and etc. after all i think this product is worth the money and it's more like a 'TOY' to keep those out there to be happy with:slickness, James bond perhaps. Definitely a 'must-try' product. highly reccommended."
2,Its small.. but thats about it,"Don't get me wrong, its a decent camara but no more then that. Think about why you are buying a camara before you pay [$$] for this one. I would think the most important thing would be picture quality, with this camara you really don't get that. The pictures are not very good when compaired to other camaras in its price range. Also think about how since the lens is fixed you cannot take a closeup picture of anything. It says in the owners manual that you the closest you can get is 1M. Think if it as you can't take a picture of text and read it as it will be too blury. The flash is also very weak as other people are saying. Don't get sucked in because of the ""cool"" factor of the camaras small size. I had one for a month then bought a Canon S200 to replace it. It's slightly more then double the size but there is no comparison in picture quality."
3,Fun but not very durable,"Served me for about two years, then slowly stopped working.I have already replaced this with a camera with optical zoom digital, but first the screen stopped working correctly, the shudder sometimes would not close when off, and I got a lot of error messages at start up.I have not dropped it, but I carried it around in my shirt and jacket pockets a lot without the case."
4,Very good ultra-compact digital...,"I bought this for the small size. It was better than expected but the upgrade has all the features I was missing on this one: larger LCD, easier control button, higher MP. It is a great conversation starter. A lack of zoom did not bother me, I just zoom in on Photoshop.Pros: Very small & lightGood quality picturesA lot of useful featuresGood priceCons: Short battey lifeSmall LCD screen, better on upgradeControl button is better on upgradeSmall size makes it easy to lose...but that is why I bought it!Otherwise is a great ultra-compact camera.I would recomend the upgraded version though."
3,This camera is weak on resolution.,I bought this camera because of the high rating the other reviewers gave it. But when I actually took pictures and enlarged them the detail quickly disappeared. My Olympus D-450 Zoom with 1.3 megapixels takes much sharper pictures. You can't beat the Casio for size and convenience at a party or family event but for greater detail go for the Canon powershot S200 digital elph. The price is the same but it is twice as thick. A small concession for quality pictures.
2,Caution run amuck,"This book is an odd blend of good massage information and extreme paranoia about ""dangerous"" massage techniques. There are indeed techniques that are not appropriate in pregnancy, but this text makes it sound as though ordinary thumb friction strokes will cause miscarriages. There are better books on the market that explain the necessary precautions without encouraging such a fearful attitude."

5,One of the best albums of all time. period.,"Whoa. That's all I have to say about this album. It is so amazing and put together with such intricacy that I could listen to this album all day. Songs like ""Breathe Out"", ""Sleeper"", and ""Grinning"" blow me away at the showcasing of the talent of every member of the band. Bill Gaal's thundering bass lines are the core of Nothingface, Tom Maxwell's explosive guitar playing and amazing solos, Matt Holt's screams and melodic voice is utterly amazing, and Chris Houck is definitely the most blurringly fast, talented drummer I have ever seen. I'm not going to go on about how bad MTV and their teeny-bopping music is, I'm just glad that MTV hasn't corrupt the beautiful thing that is Nothingface. Keep up the good work guys, and world domination will soon be yours."
5,In My Top Three...,"GODD**N!!! When I first the song Breath Out On the Hard And The Heavy cd, I liked it, but forgot it. And for months it was at the back of my head just sitting there waiting to be noticed. And when I had some money to burn I decided to try it out, (Being a little bit nervous seeing the fact the last coulple cds where real let downs) but when I poped this in my cd player...BOOM! there was a onslaught of flesh-tearing riffs, vocals that could cause your ears to bleed, and one of the best drummers I've ever heard! So, to sum it all up, if you like metal...GET THIS CD!!!"
5,Incredible!,"When I first heard the song ""breathe out"", i was hooked on them. I only knew that one song, but i still ordered it anyway. I'm VERY glad that i did. It is the most incredible CD that i have heard in a very long time. I constantly listen to it, and i bought it over a month and a half ago. It has intense vocal and guitar melodies, and reminds me of the Deftones. If you love hard music, then this CD is a MUST-BUY!"
5,another masterpiece,"ignore klauscore as he listens to limp bizkit and kid rock so his opinion means jack. oh and btw ryan, korn is good, but nothingface is 10x better than korn and killswitch engage combined are. so you might as well live with that fact, step out of your dream world and listen to some nothingface, but this time, with an open mind."
2,Overrated,"From reading the heaps of 4 and 5 star reviews, you'd think this is an awesome new metal CD along the likes of Disturbed, Nonpoint and System of a Down. Unfortunately, that isn't the case. The vocalist has the stereotypical death metal Cookie Monster growls and yelps. He sounds absolutely awful when doing soft vocals. The music is the predictable super-heavy 2-3 chord BS followed by a few seconds of softness. It's really nothing you've never heard before. The whole band comes off as a weak, talentless imitation of Disturbed, even though they came out before Disturbed. The reason it didn't get one star is because there really are much worse new metal bands out there. The band has potential, but they need a new vocalist and to learn to play longer riffs. If you like this and want something better, get Disturbed. They're so much better that it's frightening."
5,OH MAN!!!!!,"[Wow]!! This cd is like one of the best underground metal cds iv ever heard!!!! These guys kik major [bottom]!!! Violence is also AMAZING!!! They mix hardcore, straight up heavy metal and melodic metal making some incredible music!! This aint no ""nu-metal"" album, this is influential stuff!!!! GO BUY IT!!!"
1,"Save some money, buy previous editions!","I compared page for page 2006 and 2004 editions of Kaplan Medical USMLE Step 1 Qbook and was really surprised: Kaplan didn't change a single word in QBook over past 4 years. Well, I have to be completely honest: they changed 2004 for 2006 in most instances. I owned both and regret I bought latest edition myself. There were only few minute changes since 2002 and none of them affected answers (few question stems were re-written in 2004). So, if you're really want to waste your money, buy latest edition of Kaplan books."
2,NOT a Win Craft product,"Don't be fooled by the picture! This is not a Win Craft Sports Die Cast Decal. I gave it 2 stars because I probably would have kept it if the font style used was the same as the picture, but not even that is the same as whats advertised. I could have gone to the nearest mall to get one of these."
5,Tales from a Librarian.... GREAT CD!!!,"This is one of the best Tori Amos Cd's in my collection. All of the songs have been remixed or remastered and it is unlike any other ""greatist hits"" collection. I highly recommend it to any Tori fan, or those who have never even heard of her!"
5,Wonderful,This is a great copmilation C.D. It gives you a little piece of all her work rolled into one. The DVD will give you goose bumps (live from a sound check). This is also a great gift for anyone who's just getting into her.
5,Amazing!,"If you are new to Tori Amos this is the best album to start with. When I first heard it I was shocked of the quality of the songs. I can't believe she isn't bigger or more famous, she's just completly brilliant. Every single one of this songs are excellent. She's a great lyricist, songwriter and pianoist. You must own an album by this genius."
2,Depends on if you own other Tori....,"If you don't own any other Tori, then get this! A great collection of her music. If you own her other stuff, don't waste your $ because it is all the same exacts songs as you already have. As of the 4 that aren't on other CD's, definitely download them individually."
5,A must for any avid Tori fan!,"It's also a great starter album for anyone who has always wondered about the unusual red head pianist. It is essentially a chronical of all her past albums. For those who own everything Tori there's a slight flavor change on the existing songs. I believe that they were mixed slightly differenly for the album. Also two unreleased tracks, Angels and Snow Cherries from France and rare tracks, Mary and Sweet Dreams make it definately worth the buy."
5,A MUST HAVE FOR EVERYONE!!!,"This CD is excellent! Not much else needs to be said! I like them all. The only this it's lacking is a lot of her hits from ""Boys For Pele"" such as ""Hey Jupiter"", ""Caught A Lite Sneeze"" etc.....There are a couple songs on here that I would have not included.....and that were not hits for her....but all in all this CD is awesome!"
3,I wish there was more,"Tori has always been a favorite artist of mine and this CD is like a greatest hits of her songs. It's great for first time and new Tori listeners to familiarize themselves with a collection of her music over a span of her career. For die hard Tori fans, I'm afraid it may be a let down. There are only a few new songs on the CD itself, and the DVD that accompanies it has only two songs played live before one of her shows. The picture gallery on the DVD features familiar photos from previous albumns. Great for new listeners, mediocore for hardcore fans."
3,something wrong with professional widow,"I am a huge Tori Amos fan, but when I heard ""Professional Widow"" on this cd, I about cried. This cd is more of a pseudo Tori fan's dream, and a new Tori fan's dream. For those of us who have loved Tori for years, and have all of her albums and bootlegs... This isn't nearly as good as we all hoped."
4,"Something old becomes new again, plus 2 new tracks","Tori's husband and collaborator, Mark Hawley, has remastered some of Tori's best songs and given them a new polish. The sound is cleaner and subtly but significantly enhanced. Some of the background sounds have been stepped slightly forward, taking more of a center stage. Especially beautiful are ""Winter"" and ""Way Down"".New songs of ""Angel"" and ""Snow Cherries from France"" are beautifully melodic and wonderfully arranged. The re-worked ""Mary"" (a previous b-side) is also lovely.This is not a ""best of"" per se, but includes many fans' favorites. One lowlight for me is the dance mix of ""Professional Widow"" - it is discordant to the rest of the CD.The DVD is full of photos and some q & a from Tori, along with 3 bonus tracks.Any Tori fan will get this - it's a no-brainer. And it's a good entree to her music if you are new to her."
5,anything Tori does is brilliant.,"Anything Tori does is brilliant. She doesn't compromise her artistic integrity for labels, commercial success, or money, which is a rarity these days.A sonic biography is an original idea, and Tori illustrates her life beautifully through these songs.I highly recommend it to any listener, because what's great about compilations is, if you don't own any of her previous albums, this compilation exposes you to all of them. So if you don't buy any other Tori CD, this is the one to get."
5,Oh...My...God.,"Might I say, Wow? Yes, I might. And will. To anyone who will listen. This CD is just amazing.Whether you are a long-time Toriphile, or just getting started, this album will not disappoint. It's a musical jigsaw puzzle, every little piece forming one masterful whole. The Tori-trained ear will notice the smallest nuances on the remastered classics; background vocals a little brighter here, a little more strings there.Share, baby, share! Get this for yourself, your best friend, your little sister, everyone! Surprise that Tori-lover in your life, or turn a newbie on to the best musical experience they will ever have. Trust me, they'll thank you for it.And I'm thanking Tori for it."
4,Kind of a mixed bag,"It's great to hear some of the songs with a clearer sound, but other songs have been too tampered with. I didn't enjoy the track order and don't know why in hell's name they didn't include the original version of Professional Widow ( i know the remix went to n 1 everywhere in 96, but this is about artistic integrity and Tori made one of her very few misteps here by not including the original version). The dvd is interesting even though Tori was filmed during soundcheck. On the whole it's not a paramount owning, but you find a lot to love here, anyway."
5,amazing but needing a few songs....,"As all Greatest Hits cds turn out, the hardcore fans will always say ""....BUT THEY MISSED [insert fave song here]"" i guess i am no exception, being raised on Tori Amos and Smashing Pumpkins, I guess you could call me a ""hardcore"" fan of both of them...and i think they are both lacking. So enough about that, heres my list of possible missing songs:-Father Lucifer (so controversial)-Caught a lite sneeze-Hey Jupiter-A sorta fairytale-Raspberry swirl-Cruel-Winter-Bliss-I can't see New York (another controversial)-JuarezAs for redone songs, Playboy Mommy has been perfected if thats possible and Professional Widow is interesting.....listen to it enough times and you will like it. Snow Cherries from France is my favourite unreleased song played on this album...why didn't she ever add this to any of her studio albums? Its worth listening to.All and all, this cd is worth every penny...I will play it until my copy of the cd dies or cd players die first. haha enjoy!"
3,Better to shuffel with,"Tori's beautiful voice and aching lyrics abound. I find it hard to appreciate her songs in succession, but greatly enjoy hearing any of her songs now and then."
3,WOW,"So what if the music is just folky nonsense, she looks delish on the cover!!! MMMM... yummy... She looks like a modern day Betty Grable! I use this cd every morning(but not for the music, for the pic on the cover). I'm happy and so is my ""Mr. Happy,"" he's never been so happy since I own the cover of thisa cd"
2,money scam,"y tori kan't make more beautiful music? Don't give me wrong, I love all her works, well, prior to the venus era. I especially love school girl. But y o y? I guess it's nothing wrong to make a little cash but to recycle old songs and put 1 or 2 new one in is a shameful practice. Though I supposed that all record company do it too. She stepped into a new era, namely, married with children. So stop pretenting you are a strange little girl with issues and make some happy music. Better yet, write some children books like Madonna... Come on tori, you are a happy camper now. Make some inspirational music, don't string along all these poor people. It's tough, but you have to break free from your image... or not. $$$"
1,ok,OK She plays the piano well but her lyrics are weird and equally sung as weird. The only track I liked was: Silent all these Years.
5,for fans old and new,"Tori is an artist that is ever-evolving, so it was great tohear her creative new twist on some of her older songsthat we already love. However, the new songs included give the die-hard fan even more to look forward to, without alienating listeners who may not be as familiar with her music, or those who have only heard her radio hits. I bought this cd not only because I am a huge fan and would buy anything Tori creates. I was also really interested to hear what songs she chose to ""re-stylize"" and what new ones were chosen for this CD. The DVD was also an added bonus- there is nothing like seeing Tori play live and it is just beautiful. Overall a great listening and visual experience!"
5,a collection for all,"anyone who enjoys music is going to enjoy this Tori Amos collection. This c.d. covers her many talents as a singer, song writer, and musician. Be sure to note this is not a collection of greatest hits but a soulful journey through the works of Tori Amos."
5,Tori does it again,As usual Tori has put togather a fantastic collection of songs.This CD takes you on a journey of emotions perfectly placed in order to tickle the mind and raise the soul to new hights. Thanks Tori
4,Another Good Album,"Tori made another good album, playing a lot of my favorite songs. I enjoyed the new little 'surprises' in some of the older songs, but I wish that there had a been a few more new songs."
4,Reply to A music fan from Des Moines,"The problem is your DVD player. It wouldn't play on mine, either. I sent the DVD home with student workers and they played it variously on three different brand name DVD players with no problem. I've since learned that some of the older players won't read the coding on newer DVDs; this applies to players even 2-3 years old (which I have). Many people have two DVD players, a good one and a cheap one. I went out and bought a cheap $45 DVD player and it plays fine on it. It comes down to whether or not you're willing to shell out $45 to watch a Tori video, but I figure the second DVD player will come in handy as this problem becomes more frequent in the future. What one won't play, maybe the other will. Hope this helps."
4,A successful compilation,"Although many of the must-be tracks are not included here, it didn't bother me at all. Maybe we have to consider that Tori Amos has a tale to tell. The songs of this album belong here because they're following the path that Tori wants to build.All the songs have been revamped, enhancing the sound experience; sometimes vocals are cleaned up, sometimes strings. All in all, is a very good introduction for all those who don't know Tori's work."
5,Love this CD,It is a wonderful collection of her music. The songs flowed beautifully from one to the next. A must for any Tori Amos fan.
3,Fans deserve better **1/2,"The songs on this album are amazing. But if Atlantic was trying for a best of, they failed miserably. Only about half of these songs were released as singles, not to mention actual singles that were left off to make room for 6(?) tracks from ""Little Earthquakes"" - great album, but Tori fans have already bought two copies because they played the first one out. The DVD is abysmal. I was expecting concert footage; instead we got Tori running through 4 decent tracks during a sound check.The two new songs and the two remake b-sides are nice. Not that they break any new ground and were probably included to entice old fans. But Tori fans are rabid. Any group of people as obsessed as them should want more, I would imagine. This is a pretty lame way to get out of a recording contract with Atlantic.Overall: 5 out of 10."
4,Fantastic Farewell,"This collection of Tori Amos songs is a great collection. Though there are some obvious songs missing, the ones included are still strong. The comment I want to make to people is that Tori changed recording labels. She is now on Sony. This collection is of her work on the Atlantic label. Thus, this collection was issued by Atlantic. Once an artist leaves a label, sometimes that label issues compilation albums to make extra money. I am not positive but from the amazing packaging with this album, it's evident Tori had input. The library theme is just so cool. Compared to other compilations released after an artist leaves the label, this one totally rocks. Plus, it's Tori... and you can never go wrong with that!"
5,"Beautiful packaging, not so familiar with this artist","I know of this artist because of the song Cornflake girl, but have hear other songs,so decided to purchase this CD. I made an error in thinking that this was a 2 CDset, but it actually has a bonus DVD along with the CD. I returned it because of thiserror, but would like to purchase something by Tori Amos in the future"
5,breath taking,"The remixes are sudule but powerfull. Great for someone who is just getting into Tori, and a must have for the Tori collector."
2,Don't play the Bonus DVD.,"I'm giving this CD a low rating, for many of the same reasons that have already been stated in these reviews. The biggest disappointment was the ""lifting of the veil"" bonus DVD live tracks. Recorded during soundchecks, they are the most uninspired, souless, going-through-the-motion, phoned-in performances I have EVER heard or seen that were so incredibly painful for me to listen to and watch. They are perfunctory performances done just so someone offstage can adjust the electronics. I was shocked, absolutely shocked, that Tori would agree to release these.If you still believe (like I did) that Tori puts her heart and soul into each and every song, don't watch or listen to the bonus DVD."
3,Excellent book that completely dies near the end,"This book start off with a bang with Genghis(Chingis) Khan's destruction of Present day Iran. He provides excellent background on who everyone is, what happens, and how it all works out.Unfortunatly, as the book progresses, the book speeds up and Mr. Chambers starts skipping over important historical information. I admit, how do you squish 30 years worth of data into a chapter? But by the end, I was still lost over who was fighting who.Overall, I was extremely entertained, and learned much about the Mongols. I would advise this book as an excellent overview of the Mongol empire at its peak. But, There are bound to be better books out there that go over Mongol specifics."
4,The Devil's Horsemen,"A great source on the conquering Mongol Armies of the 13th Century, focusing on their infamous invasions of Eastern Europe and the Islamic West. It probably wouldn't be a good first book on the Mongols (it runs pretty dry in some sections), but it is fairly well-written and is obviously very well researched."
4,Fills in a historical gap very well,"I like to read about periods in human history that are like gray areas in my knowledge. This book is a pretty quick read and explains the Mongol's invasions of Europe form their point of view and the Europeans'. Not a lot of details about weaponry or even tactics, but plenty of discussion about the individual leaders on both sides. I banged this one out and now I know who they were and how they affected Europe. I recommend it if you want that kind of quick summary.I only gave it four stars because I did not want anyone to think that this is the be all and end all of books about the Mongols. It is what it is."
5,Good military history,"This is a good, solid military history. For a more general history of Ghengis Khan there are several other sources--John Man being the best of the recent ones. Weatherford's book is bad--too much of the noble savage stereotype rather than a real, honest picture of Genghis Khan. Also, some of his claims are not well supported. (Ghenghis Khan invented trading posts? I can't find a major Asian or European civilization that didn't have them before the Mongols.)"
3,A Simple Introduction To The Art of Sponsoring,"Michael's book is a simple introduction to the art of sponsoring.The approach he recommends is all about ""caring and sharing"" and the emphasis is about what your prospects want, and not about what YOU want.Note: This MLM book may NOT appeal to the more sophisticated Heavy Hitters.James LeongJames LeongAuthor of The World's First Book on Network Marketing with NLP,""MLM Persuasion Mastery: How Master Networkers Change Beliefs and Behavior"""
1,Don't Waste Your Time or Money,"This book is terrible, filled with a bunch of ""New Age"" hype which I found highly distracting. I was so disgusted that I could only get through 2 chapters and called it quits. A much better book for the money is ""Your First Year in Network Marketing"" by Mark Yarnell. This is an excellent book and very helpful for the newbie to network marketing."
5,EXCELENT RESOURCE,"It's a must have for all who want to make all dreams come true through Network Marketing. Read it, meditate an act on it and you'll see and live the results."
5,Fantastic guide,"This is the best book I've read on network marketing. It is a definite keeper and I have recommended this to people in my up and down-lines. Don't worry about approaching people. This gives you step by step guidelines and sample scripts, but most importantly shows you how to adapt them and make them your own. Nothing worse than canned words, you need to live and breathe what you market."
4,Simple and it works - usb cable too short,"Quickly - it works as stated - unfortunately for my application - connecting multiple hd's to my airport extreme - the included usb patch cable is too short. All this means is that I had to use a spare one lying around, so no big deal."
3,Its the only hub designed to compliment a Mac Mini,The drawback: Only supports two downstream low power devices if you do not connect its power brick. Why? Four port USB hubs should be able to support four downstream low power devices without needing external power. 100mA per port plus 100mA for the hub.One of the front USB ports is mis-labeled with a firewire 1394 logo next to it. Very smart Belkin... You should've updated your silk screen when you updated your plastic to have two front facing USB ports instead of one USB and one firewire as on your other product.
4,MAC mini USB,"the reason why i give this 4 stars is that i was amazed at the size of this thing! of course it is specified for MAC MINI - and i am sure it fits perfectly. if you have anything OTHER than a MAC mini - this would probably NOT be the best buy for you. For the size of this i would think they could put about 10 more ports and a firewire - there is really ONLY 4 ports, period."
2,Good idea but lacking!,"This is a great idea that was not taken far enough! When all is said and done I still have two plugs in my other external USB HUB! (the purchase was made to eliminate the ""other external hub"") I have: an external hard drive, an external DVD player, Canon printer, Dymo LabelWriter, Wacom Tablet, cordless mouse and ipod. Yes I am using one USB plug for the added USB port, BUT I have two items plugged into that port. AND Yes I could use the remaining front plug on the Mac Mini hub and solve all my problems. But the cotton-picking plug is in front of this unit and I wanted an easy access for a thumb drive when needed! Not to mention dangling cords in FRONT of the Belkin Hub.So I am with everyone else THIS UNIT NEEDS AT LEAST TWO MORE USB PORTS on the left side as the unit is facing you. Would I buy this unit again? Yes if Belkin would give me a trade-in allowance towards a Mac Mini Hub with 6 ports!"
3,works pretty good,"I bought this hub to add to an Apple AEBS in my network. I wanted additional USB ports to support multiple extHDD storage devices. As others have commented, the included USB cable is too short to work on the AEBS. The USB port must be in different locations between the AEBS and MiniMac.Easily a slightly longer (1ft) cable with mini-B and type-A plugs will remedy the challenge. So far it works as expected. It also looks like Belkin has adjusted the screen printing since all of my USB ports were labeled with the correct USB symbol. In comparison to the AEBS this Belkin device is well overboard on it's use of packaging materials.This USB cable might work great:[...]"
5,"If you have a mac mini or airport extreme, BUY THIS PRODUCT. You won't regret it.","I originally bought this with my airport extreme. It is easy to plug in and it is recognized by every product I have. With the 2 usb plugs in the back and the 2 in the front, it made it very easy for me to use my hard drives over the network and it lines up perfectly with my airport extreme. When I purchased my Mac Mini, I had no idea how convenient this was. Since the usb plugs are in the back of the Mini it makes it difficult if I want to plug a digital camera or my iphone in for a quick data transfer. With this plugged into my Mini, I not only have more usb plugs for my harddrives and Magicjack, I also have usb cords on the front for quick data transfers. It is a wonderful product and it is so small that is works perfectly if you do not have a lot of space."
1,This Is Garbage...Save Your Money!,"Bought this awhile ago because it compliments the Mac Mini so well and it has just the amount of ports I need. Seemed to be the perfect fit and since it was by Belkin, I thought it was a great buy. Unfortunately, this is just another great marketing ploy by what is apparently a mediocre, at best, company. It just is NOT reliable. It only works about 1/3 of the time. When it doesn't work, I have to unplug the cables in the back and then re-plug to try to get it to recognize anything I put into a port. A huge inconvenience. And this is not the cheapest hub out there to boot.Bottom Line: Save some money and search for a USB hub that actually works."
4,Nice - LED too bright,"This is a must-have if you want to maintain the sleek apple look and you need extra usb ports. The only problem I have is that the LED is too bright. It easily overpowers the Mac Mini LED, and that takes away from the aesthetics."
1,Looks pretty but doesn't cut the mustard...,"I was psyched when I got this hub. I wanted to use it for the single USB port on my Time Capsule. This way I could hook up multiple printers and storage devices that would be viewable across the entire network. After I hooked up all the USB cables and power, I turned on my MacBook Pro and nothing showed up via the Time Capsule. I plugged in each device individually to the Time Capsule USB port and each one showed up individually but not through this hub. I was bummed!I decided to do one test before returning the product. I bought a cheap 4 port powered USB hub and hooked everything else up just like before. This time, everything WORKED.I'm kind of disappointed because I like Belkin products. Maybe I got the one Lemon of the bunch?? This one should probably be avoided anyway."
5,Very Good Distiller For Home Use,"I bought this distiller about 2 months ago, and it was an excellent investment; my family and I love the quality water produced from this machine. I took another reviewer's recommendation and unplug the distiller after about 5 hours so that it doesn't boil the entire contents of the machine. It's easy to clean and easy to use. The downside is that it puts off some heat, so the A/C runs alittle more while I'm using it. Otherwise, great product!!"
4,"great water quality, but construction can be improved","It's a real good feeling to drink just plain H2O, knowing and tasting there's none of the chemicals in there... The water that comes out of this distiller tastes great, I love it. It certainly does the job well, however, I think there's quite some room for improvement as far as the construction of the machine goes. There's that ""made in china""-feel to it, but that's ok for the price - it works and it makes the impression it's solid enough to run for a few years. And I'm already totally hooked on distilled water!"
2,too long for just 1 gallon of water.,It was just taking too long to just deliver a gallon of distilled water. it took non stop the total amount of 6 hours. Convert this into dollar amount when it comes to paying the electricity bill. Specially in these trying times.
5,"Great tasting water, simple mechanism","After having 2 Sears units die on me, I found this one. I like the fact that there are no complicated electronics in it - I don't need my water distiller to tell me the time. It does take 4-5 hours for a gallon of water. This is a very reliable unit. You fill it to the line, plug it in, and press a button. Very easy to use.The carbon filters are reasonably priced and several come with the unit. It also came with powder to clean it with that works well.The water tastes great. I'm glad I'm not drinking the yellow goo left behind. This rugged unit is a very good buy."
5,"great water, easy to make",We've had this product for several months. We use it for 2-3 gallons everyday. It's easy to use. The water is great. The reverse osmosis filter wasn't taking out enough. My daughter and I had cardiac arrhytmias (probably some heavy metals) until we started drinking distilled water. Anyone with chronic health problems from unknown sources should try distilled water for a few weeks. Could make a difference.
4,What about the Leaching of Plastic through the Spout?,"There are many positive reviews for the Megahome Water Distiller and I agree with most reviewers that this is a fine product. Since positive statements have been stated repeatedly for this product, I will not repeat them and instead state my concern. The water that comes out of the unit is very hot and it is in contact with the plastic that contains the spout. There has to be leaching of plastic into the hot water, especially over time. How much is anybody's guess but it is a concern. I wonder if this unit actually produces water that is healthy if there is indeed substantial leaching. If anybody has some insight into this health concern, I would enjoy hearing a reply. Outside of the concern about leaching, the distiller has worked well for over a year with repeated use."
4,Good Product,"This is a great little product that functions just as you would expect it to. The only thing that I can't speak to is the longevity of the unit as I've only been using it for a few weeks now. However I'm able to easily produce about 3 gallons a day, cleaning is easy and turn around time between gallons is low. Also many people talk about the noise of the fan, it's actually not that loud, similar to a higher end desktop computer. If you use a fair amount of distilled water you can't go wrong with this product."
4,You can use a Glass Ice tea bottle,"I used a 1 Gallon Ice tea Jar and cut out a hole on the top with a hot knife to fit the filter attachment. It does not fit flush against the distiller but its close enough and I use a dish cloth to slightly prop it.I have been doing it this way for a month at 1 gallon a day so far it works great , no leaks or problems.Pro: Not noisy at all , water tastes good, a ton of sediment left atthe bottom so I can see its doing its jobCons: The filter attachment is quite flimsy and it gets quite hot(UPDATE)It has been almost a year and decided its not for me . Its takes a lot of effort to distill on a daily basis. I found me and my husband needed 2 gallons a day to have enough for both drinking, cooking and TeaIf you are going to use this 1 or 2 times a week to make calloidal silver or other unmentionables its worth it but for daily use its just not convenient enough. I decided to go with a Big Berkey that has a flouride filter."
4,Does a great job,"The distiller does a great job, although it takes longer than I thought it would. I just have to plan better in order to have good water available when I need it. I like the way the plugs line up. Although I like the idea of a pure, glass pitcher, I'm careful to handle it to avoid pressure on the holding straps/handle. Because of that, I'd recommind it for anyone who doesn't have to worry about small children or rambunctious pets knocking the receiving pitcher out of alignment. Perhaps a good quality/non toxic unbreakable pitcher would be better."
5,Good distiller,I chose to rate this thing because it has done exactly what I needed it to give me clean and great tasteing water I have had this product around six months now with no manufacture or mechanical problems occuring I spent alot of time comparing other distillers and Im very happy with this purchase I also bought a digital timer to give me more control over the length of time it runs instead of letting it turn itself off so I boil my water first then let it run for 4 hours it stops before all the water has been distilled and I get close to a gallon this helps keep the one charcoal filter in the nozel longer between changes and In my oppionion makes the water taste even better flouride is now history in my familys water!
4,Mechanicallly Disfunctional?,"After buying the Megahome water distiller with the glass bottle, I was feeling like a moron. Hours of trying to attach the handle to the bottle, I finally succeeded in tightening the last screw. ( Failure after failure convinced me to look for a slightly longer screw with the same threads while searching among 40 or so possibilities in a box.) How was it that I was the only moron among so many satisfied customers? Then a light bulb went on. One customer mentioned loving the idea that the glass bottle could be stored inside the distiller. Of course that meant that no handle had been installed on the bottle. How many customers have given up or did not bother to attach the handle? After saying these unkind words, I want to say that I am extremely pleased with the water distiller. However, if you are mechanically dysfunctional like me, buy the Megahome Distiller with the plastic bottle."
5,"Quiet, economical and easy to use!","I found this unit economical, effective and quiet. My sister hides her distiller in the basement because it is so noisy! My sits right on the kitchen counter. I'm able to process a batch in just under 6 hours which I thought was a good rate. I was happily surprised that the taste and water quality was crisp, clean and refreshing. I am now drinking the daily requirements of water thanks to purchasing this appliance. Here's to good health, Thank you! Taking control of your water quality couldn't be easier."
2,Dirty Internal Parts,"Received this distiller quickly, and it was well packaged and everything was in good shape. The internal Stainless steel parts were not properly cleaned during manufacturing though. They appear clean to the eye, but there is the oil and metal residue left from manufacturing the metal parts. I thoroughly washed everything with dish soap prior to the first use. The first batch of water was produced as expected, but it tasted strongly of metal. I rinsed every thing out and wiped out the boiler, and it left a black residue on the cloth. I filled everything with a water and baking soda solution, and will retry tonight. If this doesn't work I may need to return this, and find my wife a different unit."
5,Excellant,"I was so glad to find the Water Dustiller, we'd been looking for years. It works great and the workmanship on it is much superior to the last one we had."
4,Working well so far,"I have had this distiller for about a month, a replacement for the used one given to me upon my arrival on a tiny island with poor water quality. So far, the distiller is working fine. It does leave residue in the bottom, but most of that is easily washed out. I appreciate the fact that all the cords can be detached, making it easier to wash out. With perhaps 10 uses under its belt, the distiller is fine so far."
1,Works but Has A Major Problem,"I brought this distiller in the hopes of replacing the use of bottled water. Unfortunately I had to return the distiller. When I first used the distiller it produced, after aprox 3.5 hours, water with a strong metalic taste. I can't stress this enough. I could not drink it at all. But I thought that perhaps it needed a couple of uses to eliminate this awful taste so I tried again. Five times! It didn't work. The company suggested I distill with 2 cups of vingar mixed in with the water. It did not work. I then decide to return it. The company was reponsible enough to give me a full refund. I thank them for this. If you are looking for a distiller, and don't want your water to taste like a can, this one is not the one for you. I gave it 1 star because the machine did work and produced distilled water but with a big flaw."
4,Reliable but small; hard to clean but worth the trouble,"After a year of running this machine at least twice a week it still works like new.Makes 1 gallon of distilled water...lasts one person about 2-3 days. Might be too small for familiesAs it distills tap water it creates small amounts of chlorine gas which is harmful to inhale. Also creates a good amount of heat. You have to run the machine in a well-ventilated area.Cleaning the machine is a pain. Depending on water quality in your area, you will see brown and white material stuck to the bottom of the distiller, especially after 4-5 uses without cleaning. The white stuff is probably magnesium. The brown stuff is either rust or fecal matter....probably rust. You have to soak it in vinegar for a few hours before you can scrub it off.Water tastes great and no fecal matter/rust goes into your body :)"
1,2 of these have died on me after ONE YEAR,"Wow. The first distiller I bought in 2008 burned out. So, I bought another one, then the fuse breaker system decided that any time the distiller decided to heat up, it would automatically shut itself off. This is the last time I am buying this brand, from this company.BE WARNED. If you distill more 2 or more gallons a day, as we do, then this product will burn itself out.Planned obsolescence. They always wait until the warranty expires then things go wrong and always with parts that are sealed where you can't get to them to fix it."
2,Wasteful,"It distilled 2 gallons of water and then stopped working. It has a noisy fan and heats up the room. It seems to be a energy-wasting way to get distilled water. Much less expensive to buy distilled water at the grocery store. I have a dental office and we use distilled water for our sterilizer, and I thought my time was too valuable to go to the grocery store. Before it stopped working....this was about as much work, but probably at a higher operating cost for the electricity, plus the additional a/c bill to cool the room back down.Might be useful if you live a long way from a grocery store with distilled water, but I 'd get a different brand."
4,Concerned about product life,"I purchased this item through Amazon in April 2010. It was working great and I was using it for approximately 1 gallon daily. That is until today. I filled it and plugged it in and it went on for about 5 minutes. It then blew out my GFCI outlet. I unplugged it and tried again after resetting the GFCI. Again, it blew the switch. Everything else that I plugged in works perfectly except the distiller. I assume it has a short.I left a message for the company on their 1-800 number in the hopes that they will contact me. I am hoping that they will fix it since it has a 1 year warranty.I have never abused my unit. I always cleaned it regularly.That is very scary about the fire! I have left my unit running while asleep at night. If mine does get repaired, I will only run it while I am at home and awake."
5,Distiller Review,"We purchased this distiller a month ago and have cranked out, perhaps, 20 gallons. It appears to be well-made and of good quality. It works exactly as described by other reviewers. If you read other reviews, you may read comments about it being too noisy, but we do not find it objectionable--more white noise than anything, and we keep it cranking out the water right on the counter in our kitchen. It is easy to clean, easy to disassemble for cleaning, and the water from it is delightful. We use the water in a cooler and store the water in three-gallon bottles.Years ago we had a different distiller from another manufacturer, and this newer version is so much more compact and takes up less counter space. No complaints here!"
1,Very disappointed,"The distiller was not anything like it was described! It is a very cheap distiller, with a PLASTIC Collection container(not GLASS as described) As I am somewhat handicapped I won't return it, too difficult for me. I will keep it for a back-up distiller. I will never order from this company again.I purchased a distiller from Sears 20 years ago, for $79.00 and it is still working like new."
4,Clean Water,"I've had this distiller for a month. Good solid construction and great tasting water make this one of my most used appliances besides my bread machine. I have very hard spring water and can see the stuff left in the bottom of the distiller looks like tiny rocks and other stuff. It's best to clean the distiller and not let the stuff sit and dry, but it does clean up well with a little scrubbing if I do. I was buying a lot of distilled water to mix with a homeopathic remedy that required it, and had a bad experience after leaving some jugs in the very hot car for too long and ending up with what I finally figured out was sickness from ingesting whatever leached into the water from the jugs! So I went looking for distillers, read the reviews here, compared prices on the internet, made my purchase and summing it all up - I feel great and am very happy. (Robert's wife)"
4,Domo Arigato,I found this combination of fine glassware and quality green tea to be a good value. It is perfect for a single serving to unwind at the end of a long day. I have no regrets in having made this purchase.
3,good starter,"this is a good book to get you started off.it goes through the basics of:breathing,movement,stances,strikes,and falling. the area of the most insight is in the striking techniques.next most extensive section is the self defense techniques chapter.the falling is lacking as is the breathing.there are 2 unarmed sets as well as a few staff sets.there's a brief free fighting technique section.and finally there is a brief but illustrated section on herbs.if you're looking for a book that is pretty thourough on the basics of kenpo with a little more than just technique,then this is a book that you'll surely enjoy."
1,Waste of time,"BPM is solution for all problem businesses facing today: from Snow White animation to unknown changes of next 50 years -- that's the description, comments, history reivew and the coclusion from Chapter one to Chapter nine. The ""why"" and ""how"" are missed. Too bad."
4,"A little offbeat, but a must have.","Folks,Enough has been written about this book. I must say that much of the original vision Fingar and Smith have developed has come true. If you are a true BPM champion, you will have this book in your library."
2,A weak book on an important topic,Don't buy this book.It is exceptionally badly written and contains too much empty hype. It has very little real content except re-warming decade or century old ideas on process engineering.I am really disappointed with this product.
4,Good shape on the book and it arrived on time.,"Book arrived in ok shape, back cover was torn. But it arrived on time and considering the age of the paperback was in good shape. TCT"
1,Focus,"Mr.Warren seems to have trouble focusing on the subject matter in the first half of this book, making it seem to be merely a digest of fantasy and science fiction. I guess one can enjoy this book if you are open minded, very open minded. There are however more serious and factual findings on this subject for the more serious UFO fans. If you must buy the book, save your cash and buy the paperback."
2,Don't believe the hype.,"One ought to suspect something is up with Larry Warren's story when ufos start to appear early in his life. Warren says he was a ufo buff in those days and that admission alone would seem to compromise the objectiveness--and thus, the credibility--of anything he has to say about what, if anything, happened at RAF Woodbridge/Bentwaters. But the story gets bigger and stranger until, well, one simply cannot take it anymore. Unless, of course, you already believe the government is in cohoots with aliens, there are secret alien hide-outs and tunnels under sensitive military installations, etc. in which case everything falls into place as you might expect. Curiously, the glowing reviews on the dust jacket are written by marquee names, every single one wedded to the alien abduction/conspiracy theory"
4,Great Characters Here!,To tell you the truth - I have only read an old manuscript of this great first novel of Tracy's... which I couldn't put down until I was through with it. I'll post a full review as soon as I finish this newly published book - I can't wait until it shows up at the door.
2,Go for a PCI card if you are serious about video capture,"I bought this USB adapter a month ago. It proved to be of no use to me.I used it on a Dell 866 MHz with 384MB. Everything seemed to be okay. Installation went smooth. Studio 8 is excellent (though this comes with a Studio LE which is a trimmed-down version). But the video, that is captured using it, speeds up (or skips) once in a while (as if it is trying to catch up). To give an example, I had a video of a moving train. The train moves like a centepede in the video. From asking around, I heard that the USB must be the bottleneck. I think I have USB 1.0 and that must have been the problem. I hear that USB generally is not recommended for video capture. So, I went ahead and bought a PCI card for video capture. It works great.My piece of advice - buy this only if you have a good reason not to buy a PCI capture card. Don't even think about it if you have an older computer (with USB 1.0)."
1,A Nightmare,Beyond lousy. The instructions are incomplete and contradictory. I'll spend a couple C-notes to buy a video capture device that will work.
1,50 cents a page,"Well if you read the title.. it's true. 50 cents for each page in this book. I saw the cover online and bought it hoping it had info on the generals. Their info? This is Jedite, he stole energy.... UGG!! two senteces each! also since it is anime based, it thinks Zoicite is a girl NOT!! it also says that the generals were Endymion's friends, NO! They were his protectors, like the senshi and the Princess of the moon. This book is meant for a kid who is bound to tear out the pages anyway. I recogmend it, if at all, for ages 2-3."
5,FOR ANY SM FAN,this book is a must buy. excelent plot and awsome pictures. if u like to draw sailor moon than this is definately a must buy.Sailor Earth
4,Sailor Moon Friends and Foes book,"I bought this book a couple years ago. It really told me alot about the first series. I recomend this book to fans who doesn't know much about her. Right now, as I think of it, I gave this book 4 stars, not 5 because I like the novels better."
5,just a little info from everybodys friend Zoi,"This book somehow failed to mention that I am a MAN! Also, we like to call the ""Negaverse"" the ""Dark Kingdom,"" as in the original manga by Takeuchi Naoko. Other than that, nice pictures of me and my friend Kunzite/Malachite. Reccomended for the younger fan, or anyone who doesn't know a thing about the best aspect of Sailor Moon-- ME (I mean, me and the other three generals...) --Zoisite (PS Jadeite says ""melt me"" and Nephrite says ""hi"" to Naru-chan/Molly.) Have a nice day ;)"
4,No surprises here,"I have several AudioQuest items in my home and this one fits right in with my expectations. It worked perfectly, right out of the package and was reasonably priced. Sound quality through my 7.1 system is noticeably (but not greatly) better than analog. It's well-constructed and works fine. The eco-nerd in me says that they HAVE to find better packaging... it's in a non-recyclable plastic tray inside a corrugated box. If you're looking for bells and whistles and a lot of useless paperwork, buy Monster. If you want something simple that works and has a good corporate history behind it, look no further."
5,An excellent start,"I devoured this book in 4 days with very little difficulty. In this crazy market, I felt I needed some direction in securing my gains. I now approach stock trading with a whole different light and am applying what I learned form this excellent book. I found the Elliott Wave principal a bit hard to utilize right away, as was stated in the book and I am paraphrasing, ""one can write a whole book on this subject alone"". The best thing about this book is that in a matter of one week, I can converse intelligently with stock brokers, and I actually understand what is being said in the radio stock shows making the experience more enjoyable. The book is put together logically (much appreciated) and the integrated analysis techniques at the end of the book are GOLD! I must have counted about 100 practical market charts of indexes, currencies and others. All around, an excellent book for the SERIOUS BEGINNER, but not the end all, just the beginning. This book is AWESOME! Good job Mr. Copsey."
5,Wow so pricey,"The con for this book is its price. But, I think the author has done a great job in explaining his techniques in a clear manner. Very useful and highly recommended."
5,surprise in my cart!,"i missed out on a friday sale..this was like 54.00....i added it to my cart and one day it showed up at about 56.00 marked down from 94.00...i was looking for an on/off model like this one to make recipes out of the ultimate rice cooker cookbook.....this is a great cooker for price....the snap shut lids are so much better than the glass lid models...my experience....i had a sunpentown and zojirushi previously..the zojirushi i gave away and the sunpentown burned down with my home.....never a problem with either!rice cookers are so great and do so much more than cook fantastic rice..try one....this model is fantastic for price and real pretty with the flower accents!!!this comes with a measure cup, steamer basket and rice spatula...."
3,Worked Well and Then....Kaput,we didn't change how we made the rice or the brand its the machine started working differently. I would not buy this product again.
2,The inside pot corroded after 1 year of use,"I give 2 stars because the rice cooker engineer will work for many years but the main problem with this cooker is the inside pot. Because it it stickless so there is a coating inside this pot. But the coating will corroded by the rice and water only after 1 year of using. Because I am afraid that we will eat the corrotions from the peeling in the pot. I have to replace this $100 investment with other rice cooker after using it for 2 years. I did not want to replace it until my husband said ""Which one is more important, $100 or our health?"" So I suggest if you are going to spend $100 on the rice cooker, find the one with the best pot--I bought Sanyan eventually."
1,regret buying this rice cooker,"i regret buying this cooker because after a year, the rice starts to stink after a day. it gives an awful smell on the rice that you won't be able to eat it and just throw the rice in the garbage to waste. i don't know what causes the smell, i tried cleaning it but no result. it doesn't even go with the costumer service number info. i have to buy another brand because of this."
3,Warning adults only,"...This book is disturbingly graphic with scenes of animal torture, graphic sex and satanism. I don't think it should be read by anyone other than adults. It was so upsetting to read what Jadie went through and I think there should be a warning on the front cover about the explicit and graphic nature of the contents. ... a very disturbing book...."
4,Real life Horror Story,"I love Torey Hayden's books and own all of the non-fiction ones. Ghost Girl was by far the most troubling, frightening and haunting book of them all. The things Jadie and her sister went through, and the things she confessed to Torey were just...almost indescribably awful. There is a part of the book where Torey reads a book about similar sadistic things being done and she says she wants to ""throw the book into the fire"" for putting such evil, disgusting thoughts in her mind by making her aware of their existence. Despite the fact I love Torey Hayden and all her books and thought this was good as well, that is how I felt while I was reading Ghost Girl. So be forewarned!"
5,not just any true story....,"i loved this book. this is my first time reading any of her work. and i'm very impressed. the story of a young girl who cries out for help by being an elective mute. a teacher who saves Jadie from the spiders, the characters from dallas, and most of all from that which makes her feel like she has to bend over to hold her insides in."
5,Ghost Girl Book,I loved the book couldn't put it down. Read the whole thing in 2 days. Very shocking and moving to say the least.
3,Another Hayden Pleaser,"More from Torey Hayden wonder teacher. I found this to be one of the less interesting works of hers. There is no true ending, perhaps that is why. We never know the true story behind what this girl endured."
5,An Unforgettable Read,"This was a fascinating story that I stayed up late to finish in one night.When a Special Education teacher begins to see clues that Jadie, one of her students, might be the victim of possible ritualistic sexual abuse, she digs deeper and ultimately must come forward with her suspicions.This is a haunting, riveting read!"
2,dougv,"A slow moving film, with a boring plot.The actors are British, so it's sometimes hard to understand them.Not a good movie, so I shut the DVD player off."
2,Not True to the Book,"My twelve year old who read and loved the E. Nesbit book Five Children and It hated this movie. I have also read the book, and the movie has very little in common with the original story. There is no eccentric uncle and cousin Horace or secret door in the greenhouse. The children are not sent to the country because of the war. Even the wishes the children make are not true to the book. My nine year old enjoyed the movie because she had not read the book.So, although it is pleasant, clean, family entertainment, I think E. Nesbit would have been disappointed at the adaptation of her book. It seems to me that the producers of this movie merely plagiarized E. Nesbit's idea of five children and a sand fairy and then totally wrote their own story borrowing from C.S. Lewis' Chronicle of Narnia series."
1,All Films Are Presented In Fullscreen Only,"The specs on Amazon are incorrect. I was hoping to finally get Witches in a widescreen anamorphic presentation. I just received this DVD, and the package states that all four are presented in Full screen only. I am sending it back to Amazon for credit."
3,Hmmm...,"I got my moneys worth for sure, so not complaining in the least bit. Two films are British or have a British fill to them, and the other ones are pretty cool. The never ending story is a great film on this one, and the rest are ok. I don't think he children will sit and watch however, so i think this one is just for the adult to go BACK into time and enjoy some kid's mystery classic stories. You get your bang for your buck because it's four movies and I don't care what anyone says, four movies for this price is great because you never know who will like what and these movies always save room because they are four in one pack."
2,5 Children & It,"This movie was slow moving and the dialogue is boring.Like someone else mentioned the special effects of the wings looked fake.The British accents were annyoing.Basically I didn't like it and no I didn't read the book,I didn't know there was one.I'm so dissapointed in kids movies these days.I wanted to see it because of the creature on the cover/sand fairy.I thought it would be simalar to the kids movies I grew up with in the 80's but sadly that wasn't the case."
3,Mediocre but passable,"The movie has a lot going for it: Great cast, excellent costumes and settings, and the basis for a wonderful story. But it was a big fail for translating the book's spirit to the screen, and appeared to have been hastily edited. There were laughable moments but it was a mostly tedious movie. Watchable, yes, but be patient.After watching it, my 10 yo daughter said a better name would have been ""Four children, a sea roach, and a random kid."" Search sea roach images and you'll see what she means. Lamb was a hugely distracting character whose presence was needed only for one 10 second very implausible sequence. ""How did he do that?"" and there never was an answer. Likewise many other mysteries were presented but never answered in the movie. Even the ending was ambiguous whether it was real or an illusion. A big thumbs-down on the directing and editing, but still a passable movie."
4,"Does not follow original books well, but a charming movie nonetheless","This newer movie version of ""5 Children and It"" does not follow the novel very well. It also adds an additional child, a cousin, who is not at all needed for the story line.Despite that, I did find the children delightful actors. The filming is beautiful. The music is nice. The special effects are well done. The pace and action are done in a good way and the ""new"" plot does unfold to a nice happy ending.If you are looking for a fun and entertaining movie, this is a good choice, so long as you are not committed to a movie that follows the original novel.Thanks"
3,Too loose,"While this product works fine, connects to any phone I have tried, and I have had no problems with it, the only place it has a use is maybe while driving or doing some other sedentary activity. It just falls off too easily with any activity. I have replaced it with a product the is much more stable on the ear and doesn't come off almost no matter what. Since it is a different brand, I won't mention it here."
2,Very Ridiculos,It was a stupid book to me.it seems like the writer didn't really think about what he was doing it seems like he was imagining when he was writing. Thats why he had to come up with a continution of the book his story serve's no point it sounded to made up it was a totally ridiculos BBLLLAAh!
2,C&B BOOK REVIEWER -SHAKEERA FRAZER,"Author: Victor L. MartinTriple Crown Publications PaperbackJuly 2011A Hood Legend takes you through the day-to-day life of Menage Unique Legend and his associates in the streets of Miami. I really liked the story line of the book and the twists and turns but I thought that it could have flowed much better. The problem I had with this book was that each couple of pages changed to different characters and situations without giving many details, making the beginning somewhat confusing. I also was distracted and often thrown off by the constant mention of Menage's Canary yellow Escalade ESV with Burberry seats. There were also grammatical errors that were overlooked. Overall I think A Hood Legend could have been a great story if there were more details and it was more developed.C&B; Book Reviewer- Shakeera Frazer - ** 2.5 Out of 5 Stars--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
3,"Great sculpt, flimsy and unbalanced design","As a 3-D implementation of Alex Ross' magnificent artwork, these figures are near flawless. As posable ""action"" figures, they leave a lot to be desired. There is not much articulation at all on Hawkman and the avian forward-leaning stance makes it nigh impossible to even just pose this figure without it falling forward, but as has been pointed out, if you pull the wings all the way back it will work. I tried to see if the legs would move forward a bit and the left foot/talon snapped off right in my hand! I superglued it back, but still, some less brittle plastic would have made this a more durable figure."
5,Looks great but handle with care!,This figure looks great but be very careful handling the spear. I was putting it in his hand and it broke! I guess I wasn't careful enough because I expected it to bend not snap! The articulation isn't very good but the wings move which was a nice surprise. He leans forward just a bit too far making him a little hard to balance. That's what you need the spear for!
5,Not much ACTION but a great figure!,"This is an amazingly cool looking figure. I bought it as decoration for my desk/cubicle at work, but was still dissapointed in the amount of articulation. The lack of articulation leaves limited pose choices. It is really more of a show piece -- and a very impressive looking one at that."
1,BORING,"This game is so lame! You have to wait for the screen to load every step you take EXAMPLE: You start outside a house you have to CLICK to enter the house, wait for the screen to load.. Click the stairs, wait for the screen to load. Click to go to the end of the hallway.. ETC. Tons of loading Lack of graphics VERY BAD INVESTMENT. It as a pretty case and thats about all.Do yourself a favor and CLICK away from this product.You won't regret it!"
3,tricky watch,This is a great looking watch but the dials were very difficult to manipulate and the watch face itself was HUGE. It is a very sharp watch but the functionality is a little lacking and it is very hard to tell the face of the watch is gigantic.
5,Anyone Can Reinvent Themselves,Peter Fogel's book is a refreshing mix of stories told in an entertaining and thoughtful way. Peter shows that sometimes reinventing yourself isn't because you are trying to overcome tragedy or hardship in your life. Reinvention and change are for everyone. Peter's interviews show a whole spectrum of reasons to reinvent yourself along with advice on how to do it. What are YOU waiting for!
2,not what i expected,i was disappointed in that i hoped the various people whose stories were told would be a) more interesting and b) would show examples i could use ... having said that ... the end part where bob bly explains about how to get out of a slump is good reading...
2,"If not now, then when",I would have preferred to borrow this book from the library rather than having invested in it. It's not a book I would read again when I need a pick-me-up.
2,Pointless,"This is, frankly, a terrible book. I'm a conservative, but I didn't find O'Rourke funny, clever, or insightful in the slightest. This book is exactly what it claims to be: a list. It is a sequence of long, boring lists of names, many of long-forgotten figures and celebrities. Explanations for the choices are rare, and superficial.The essay about Carter at the end is mildly amusing, if trite. The ""why I am conservative"" is slightly better, but nothing most conservatives haven't already heard a thousand times before, in a more articulate manner.I've never read O'Rourke before this. They say his other work is better. I certainly hope so."
3,Only for a new beginner- to slow moving,"I am fairly new on the reformer, but have taken some private lessons on it. This is a very slow moving DVD. If you have any experience on the reformer, you would be disappointed with this product. I think the problem is that Moira explains every little move at a snails pace (I'm not going fast). I wish she would discuss the movement as she does it, not as the model does it."
4,Great for Beginner,"If you are just starting out, this one is for you...but it does move sloooow! It is nice that it provides one complete work-out. I used it to keep me on track and just did the more advanced level of the exercises, rather than the fundamental ones on the DVD."
1,Very disappointed,"Very disappointed. This is more like a lecture than an exercise tape. Its' name led me to believe that it would be something to work along with at home, smooth, music along with it. Instead it is a lecture explaining what muscles are used in each exercise, etc. not something that would produce a smooth workout."
5,"Easy to use, good pace so you can learn, and excellent program that covered all the exercises and warm ups that I needed.",I would recommend this highly to anyone who is starting and anyone like me that just needed a refresher course!
3,good but not great,"This was a decent video on the building of garbage trucks. I've got a couple of young boys (3 and 5) who are going through a garbage truck phase and they really enjoy almost any book/movie about the trucks. Though this one is good, it is geared toward children a little older than 3 and 5. The commentary is done in a straight-forward, teaching voice rather than a voice overly animated for children. Also, there is no animation of any kind. Overall, it was good and my boys sat down to watch it on 3 occasions but their attention was only held for 5 to 10 minutes."
4,Amazingly Informing,"My son is obsessed with garbage trucks and since this is the only movie on Amazon related to garbage trucks, we rent it frequently. He loves the scenes of the trucks in action, but since he is 2, he isn't really interested in how the trucks are made. I don't think he understands what they are building. However, I now can tell you how trucks are made and the various types of garbage trucks. :) Not bad for 1.99 for a week."
3,Better for 3 years and up,My boys are 2 1/2 and the narration was lost on them. They really enjoy seeing videos of trash trucks in action.
1,JUNK OF ALL JUNK,"AFTER MY 7 YEAR OLD REFUSED TO PLAY WITH THIS OUT OF FRUSTRATION WHEN THIS KEPT FALLING APART---I SUPER GLUED IT. THIS LASTED A FEW WEEKS, AND THEN SHE WAS PLAYING WITH IT, BUT NOW---THE SUPERGLUE CAME APART AND THIS TOY SITS UNPLAYED WITH AGAIN. TERRIBLY DESIGNED PRODUCT. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY A POLLY POCKET MALL---YOU WILL GET MUCH MORE SATISFACTION OUT OF IT."
2,It's just awful...,"This toy was tops on my 5 year old's Christmas list - I paid less than $40 for it - but it still is a piece of junk. None of the parts seem to fit together. The escalator sides consistently fall off. I still can't believe I had to spend another $7 for speciality batteries for the music store. My daughter has played with it, but not a lot. I'm steering clear of Bratz toys in the future. She got the Polly Pocket fashion mall from my cousin and plays with that much more - and that only cost about half of this thing!"
1,totally disapointed,"I bought the mall and the other stores for my daughter for christmas, and all I did was waste my money. The design on the stores entrances are so small a childs hands cant fit thru, let alone with a doll in her hands,the store tips over and the items fall out. The bridge that connects the elevator to the gazebo is always breaking away from the elevator.. the sides of the rails on the bridgeway are always falling off. Dont waste your time and money I wish there was someone I can talk to about getting my money back. It is very clumsy for the prices I paid for the items..signed a very disatisfied customerDeniseMk"
4,Another piece of junk,whenever somthing falls down and i try to pick it up everthing else falls down.I thought it was a mall it only has three store's.
1,I agree-piece of junk!!!!!!!!!!!,"This was a Christmas gift for my 5 yr. old. It is now sitting in a pile of parts in the original box. I am glad I didnt pay full price for it. As you have probably read in other reviews, the pieces do keep falling off, making it nearly impossible to play with. She has barely touched it since I got it put together. Luckily the place I bought it at didn't sell the expensive little batteries, or I would have sunk another 25% of the price I paid back into this piece of junk. The problem is until the kids have one the kids are going to want it, how do you explain to them its a piece of junk?"
1,Another piece of bratz junk!!!,"I bought this item for my daughter for christmas and it was a total disappointment. Just like all the other bratz items I have bought, it is not durable, it falls apart or falls over whenever you touch it. I would hope that by all the bad reviews and phone calls about their poorly made items that MGA receives, that they would start making better quality toys. There are so many bratz fans out there that truly deserve better. Parents don't waste your money, You may find yourself trying to explain to your child why santa brought them such a piece of junk."
1,STUPID!,The elevator didnt work that good and the stuff keep falling off the shelves. I HATE IT!!!!!!!!
1,Kinda Weird,"How are those fleas called bratz suposed to get to the stores? there is one store that the stairs connect to and a store below that but there's a patio on the highest bulding, how do they get on, climb the stairs and fart their way up? and thers two other stores with no escelators, and one is a movie theetre with no movie so you buy plastic popcorn and a ticket to go to a movie theater with no sticker on peice of plastic movie, jump roof to roof I guess"
2,Cost Too Much!!,"Can't believe how much this set cost. It's not worth it! After you get it all set up, and start to play with it, it all come crashing down and falls apart! It should also come with all the batteries for the price, and something to hold it together!! I'm going for My Scene Barbie instead! Barbie Rules!!"
1,"waste of money,overpriced plastic","santa got this gift for my 9 year old for christmas,and what a let down! hard to put together,easy to fall apart.What a waste of money for a junk of plastic."
5,Funorama!,"Wow! This toy rocks! Nevra is sooooo cool looking! The toy may have a lot of small pieces, but it still rocks! 100 stars!"
2,JUNK!,"We bought this for our 9 year old daughter for her birthday. It's not durable at all. Unless you want to put this together every time your kid wants to play with it, you have to find a place to set it up permanently. My daughter says she likes it but she never plays with it. We overheard her tell her buddy its pathedic. We found it under her bed all ripped up & she wrote on it with sharpie, "" pathedic "" We asked her friends if they wanted it but they think its stupid, so we threw it out. Its a waste of money. (...)"
1,More Display Than Play,"First, this mall has a lot of cute ideas but more for display value than play. The stores are too small to reach inside easily so you will upset the other items. Take for example the music store. We tried putting the cds on the stands, some stayed but not easily. If the store or stand is even tapped watch out. As for the escalator it can be a challenge to get the doll in the clip (at least the clip we received). Then when you turn on the escalator you need to pay attention to turn it off right away or it starts making a clicking noise - not sure how long it will last if someone really wants to play with it. Overall for the price I think there are a lot of better things out there!"
2,too small!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,i dont have the mall and i dont want it!!!!!!!!!!!!! too small!!!!!!!!!!!i have the STRUT IT!!!! shoe store and the lil bratz cant even fit in the store!!!!!!!!i recommend the BRATZ instead.
5,Works Great!,"I have a terrible sleep disorder. In fact, I take Lunesta every night and have for years. But, Lunesta doesn't help me fall asleep. It helps me stay asleep. I added the Melatonin a couple months ago - I take 10 mgs - and it really makes me very sleepy. Love it. The product came quickly and well packaged. I recommend it highly to anyone who has trouble falling asleep."
4,great to knock you out!,"These are good melatonin tablets. Supposedly the sublingual helps absorption, but from a psychopharmacological standpoint this is somewhat meaningless. Orally they work equally as well as sublingually.They taste good though."
2,40% increase in price since Feb 2012,I love this product and have come back to purchase again but with a 40% (over $7) increase in price since Feb 2012 that's price gouging. 2 stars for price 5 stars for product.
5,Unbelievably Sharp Knives,I love these knives. I have used them for over a year. They stay super sharp. But I do not abuse these knives. I do not let anyone else use them. They will chip. Don't try to cut something hard that could chip the blade. This is very similar to not letting anyone cut plastic with my sewing sissors!! I believe with a little bit of thoughtfulness these knives should stay super sharp for years.
4,PAL 60 SYSTEM,"I'VE JUST BOUGHT THIS CAMCORDER AT AN AMERICAN PX STORE IN IRAQ. IM BRITISH AND SERVING HERE IN IRAQ. IT IS MY FIRST CAMCORDER AND WAS RECOMMENDED TO ME. I'M A BIT WEARY THOUGH ABOUT BEING ABLE TO VIEW MY RECORDINGS ON MY TV IN BRITAIN WHICH IS PAL 60 AND MY CAM IS NTSC. I AM AWARE IT HAS PAL 60 COMPATABILITY BUT AFTER READIN A REVIEW I'M QUITE SCEPTICAL WETHER IM GOING TO HAVE PROBLEMS VIEWING MY RECORDINGS IN BRITAIN ON A PAL. CAN ANYONE HELP ME WITH THIS QUERY? AS ITS NTFC, WILL THIS CAUSE ME PROBLEMS FOR VIEWING ON PAL 60 TV?????"
1,bought a better 1,"I had intended on purchasing this item for my 16 year old daughter as a graduation gift, but upon inspection of the display I found it did not have half the things I wanted and also that Target did not even have them in stock.After searching a few more stores I found a much better camcorder, with many more options.Of course it cost more but the price did not matter, my daughter had specifically asked for a camcorder with a tilt screen and we wanted 1 that was compact and easy for her to use.Needless to say Targets display was not what we were looking for and again they were out of stock and had no idea when they would get more camcorders in"
1,Worst Camera Ever!!!!,"I have used my camcorder about 5 times, on my 7 month old's 1st trip to Disneyland I went to change the tape at the end of recording, and put a new tape in. After changing the tape, the camera would no longer play nor record. Of course I was just out of the 1 year limited warranty, and now it will cost almost as much to fix the camera as it would to buy a whole new one. It has never been dropped, nor mistreated. It just stopped recording or playing for no reason at all. What a waste of money."
1,Started Malfunctioning after only 3 months,Had it 3 months and am now having all kinds of problems with interference showing up on screen during playback and recording. Tried a head cleaning tape with no success. Sorry I ever bought it.
4,You get what you pay for!,"I may only be 15, but I know quality. Over all this camera has some good points, I must admit. The zoom on this camera is phenominal and it charges quickly.This camcorder, though, only lasts about 30 minutes, so it is hard to do any filming. The digital effects- simple, the quality of the product- Okay. I think that for the price you pay, it's an overall decsent camcorder."
3,Good camera for normal use,"One good feature with this camera is that it has a built in light, so the camcorder works great during nighttime. One more goodthing is that it can playback tape on TV in both NTSC & PAL. One major drawback is that this camera does not have the feature 'Digital Image Stabilization' ( minimizes unwanted picture shaking ). Comapred to SCL810, model SCL860 comes with this feature, and SCL860 is only few bucks more, so I shall recommend SCL860 compared to SCL810."
4,Samsung has me singing...,"...and I don't mean the blues! I am very pleased with this recorder. I recieved it, charged it and videoed a wedding the next day. The picture quality is great and the battery life is actually more than 30 minutes. I used the camera intermittently from 10:00am-3:00pm. I kept the LCD on most of the time and played with almost every feature. The buttons may be poorly placed if you are trying to playback while holding the camera which is not a big issue for me. For people who simply want to capture special moments, this camera is fine and does not put a dent in the budget. I am going on vacation in NYC and this recorder is going with me."
2,"Terrible book, but quite entertaining","I gave this book 2 stars based simply on its entertainment value: my friends and I have never had so much fun reading a book before. I would guess that the person that donated to our college's coffee shop did not feel the same.However, Ms. Spindal's advice is insulting and superficial at best. Sure, she has some down-to-earth common sense tips; but, as other reviewers have stated, if you need to be reminded to keep up with personal hygiene, you have other issues.Some of her advice is even disturbing: we can and should live without carbohydrates? I'd like to see some scientific studies that back-up that claim, Ms. Jindal. Also, a man that alphabetizes his bookcase should be avoided, but a man that has been in several failed marriages is still ok?All in all, I would not recommend this book for anyone that is not a wealthy urbanite."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!,"I think this book is harsh and unrealistic. I also met the author (at one of her OVER PRICED parties) and find her ways of meeting people to be extremely shallow... I say, love yourself the way you are. You do not need to change for someone else. And if you do, who wants them? To her, if you are not a young, Barbie doll, you will never find love. I guess she must be doing something right. She is making a lot of money off of her advise, parties and books. I would love to have my money back!!!"
1,Saw her on television,"She said plain people won't find a pot for their lid. She said the world is superficial. I'd already been to the bookstore, so it was too late. I was shocked to see she'd stolen most of her ideas from other writers in this genre. As a regular reader of this kind of book, I could not have been more surprised to see all the cliches. Pots, lids, superficial--doesn't she know we are people with hearts and souls and, most of all, feelings that can be easily hurt?"
1,There are better books out there.,"The majority of this book is about looks (which I agree is important when attracting a man) but Janis thinks everyone over 100 pounds will never get married. If you are not 25, under 105lbs and live in a fashionable area of New York she does not think you have a chance. Some of the advice in this book is ridiculous..get professional blowouts, massages, a personal trainer, image consultant, veneers (which cost at least $15,000),etc. how many people can afford this? Also, she has several plugs in the book for service providers who are listed on her website. Does she get free service from all these people she mentions? There is some good advice but her New York attitude definitely shows throughout the book."
1,There's more to dating than nail polish and sexy clothes,"The instructions in this book we mainly superficial. The main message was that as women we had to look sexy, our best, nails, hair, clothes. The questionaire inquired nothing of real personality. I was very disappointed. This was not a book for real people. This book is for those that make judgements only on the surface."
4,I't's better than the South Beach Diet book,"I picked up a copy of the book today and I'm almost done with it! You kept my attention with your honesty, straight forwardness and knowledge. It's an easy read and every women can identify with what you are saying. Most women will thank you for writing this book."
1,OLD and IRRELEVANT,"I bought the Spanish narration edition. As I live and teach in Ecuador, I bought this video hoping to use it in my cultural anthropology classes. Unfortunately there was very little information about the culture and customs of the indigenous people. It was more of an introduction to some of the cities in Ecuador and Peru and some of the crafts that the indigenous people make. The footage is ancient (from the 60's I think) and amateurish (much was shot by a shaking hand or by holding a camera out a window while riding in a car). Also the information presented was severely outdated and irrelevant. I don't understand how the release date come have been listed as 2006. In my opinion it should be listed as 1966. I feel this video was misrepresented as a documentary and I would be ashamed to show it to a kindergarten class here in Ecuador."
2,Katt Williams: American Hustle,"The disk arrived on time and in new packaging, unfortunately the disk was damaged and would not play properly"
5,Awesome,"Katt Williams is one of the funniest comedians OUT THERE. He is edgy, raunchy, and just an all around laugh a minute. This was a great follow up to ""The Pimp Chronicles Part 1"". I laughed until I cried. LOVE HIM!!"
2,Katt Williams: American Hustle,"This was so-so, it was a bit dry. I thought his Pimp Chronicles Pt 1 was on point and funny. If I was him I would have left the part of Ludacris sleeping out of the movie, because after a while that's how one felt."
5,DVD,I bought this for my older daughter which she like it very much but you have to be in this kind of movie mode to like to watch.
5,very pleased,my purchase was in great condition and the seller deliverd very promptly no complaints here
2,Where's the cinnamon?,I thought this product sounded great and the reviews were good so I bought two of them. Problem is I could only taste the cloves which is one of the ingredients. If I tried real hard I could get a little orange but could never taste cinnamon which is the main reason I bought it. I love Apple Cinnamon tea and thought Cinnamon flavored honey would make it better. I am back to regular honey.
2,Try another charger and get your batteries somewhere else...,"Yes, it does charge in an hour or so, but...it doesn't fully charge the battery, even after leaving it in there for hours. I found this out after being unsatisfy with the life I was getting from my batteries. I decided to put the batteries in my ""slow"" charger one day and found that I was getting much longer life via my ""slow"" charger. What I do now is let this charger do most of the work then when it says it is done, I put the batteries in my slow charger to get a full charge. Also, you are better off buying some other rechargeable batteries than the ones that come with this unit. These are about as low rated (600mAh) as you can get. I get around 3 hours of playing time with these batteries in my mp3 player. My 800mAh Sony batteries last about 50% longer."
4,"Good book, you may learn what was left out in histoy classs.","A very good and a very interesting book. I enjoyed it very much. There is a lot of history and understanding that I missed in school. You may find that corruption and wrong doing in American and in local politics is not unique to the this decade. If you like this book and want to read a related book also set in the northwest check out ""Two Rooms : The Life of Charles Erskine Scott Wood"" by Robert Hamburger; Paperback"
2,what is the deal,"The book which is ostensibly about a murder and a murder trial obsessively wanders off in all directions. Any time a noun appears--IWW, Pinkerton, baseball, theatre, etc. the author spends 50-100 pages telling us about a new subject. we don't even get to the trial for nearly 500 pages and then the treatment is inadequate.Common Ground was an awe-inspiring work. I found this to be terribly disappointing."
2,Two books entangled....,"The problem with ""Big Trouble"" is it tries to be two books at once. The first is a chronicle of the murder of the governor of Idaho and it's aftermath. The second is an general history of the U.S. during the latter 19th Century.If you could separate the two, say 2-300 pages on the murder and trials, and 500 pages divided into chapters on all the various subjects the author thought worthy of research, it would be both a good read and a useful reference.But the way it's presented, with the narrative constantly interrupted by discourses only tangentially related to the story itself, it is neither.I do appreciate the tangential material, but not the way it's presented. The narrative becomes increasingly difficult to follow when the events of a single week may be interrupted with accounts of something that happened in 1892, and then another in 1866, then a page later on to a new tangent...."
4,"Better than most yet, just shy of great.","Before reading Big Trouble I had only a passing familirarity with Debs, Heywood, the IWW and the rather large socialist movement in this country. Lukas has piqued my interest and I will read more. I would like to know why so much information was in the book that stuck me as purely extraneous I.E the meandering paen to Ms. Barrymore. Without giving much away the last paragraph in the book's epilogue dealing with another fatal bombing should have been more thoroughly explored at the expense of Ms. Barrymore and any number of other digressive bit players. Still this was an excellent read."
4,An excellent history and overview of a period,"Having lived in Idaho only five years, I found Big Trouble to be an extremely interesting book. I actually live in the Coeur d'Alenes, in Wallace, only 10 miles from the Bunker Hill Concentrator in Wardner and about 6 miles from Burke, and, although I had heard of the mining wars, and a little about the Steunenburg assasination, I had no idea of the national attention this incident received, much less coming close to instigating a Socialist revolution. I learned a lot from reading this book. I will admit that the author does go off on tangents, which may seem annoying at first, but eventually, one gets to see the point, and they actually begin to become interesting. Lukas is giving a good overview of the period, so that we can fully experience the situation, and dive right in, along with Haywood, Borah, Darrow and McParland, and, in a sense, experience the trial with them. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in Idaho history!"
5,One of the year's outstanding works in American history,"Big Trouble is a meticulously researched and interesting work on America at the turn-of-the century. The murder of an Idaho governor and subsequent trial of three union leaders, including Big Bill Haywood, sparked national attention. The trial also symbolizes the progressive issues of the day. Within that context, the reader will enjoin several diverse personalities of that era, including politicians, famous trial lawyers, artists, journalists, actors, and athletes. Big Trouble is as much a trial of America during the Industrial Revolution, filled with social tension, class struggle and labor unrest, as it is a trial involving victims and villains of an Idaho landscape."
2,A hundred words when only a few are needed.,"I thoroughly enjoy reading historical accounts of epic events and especially when the writing is discriptive and gives good background coverage. But this book goes into such intimate details of so much unnecessary information that it weighs the story down. You loose any direct connection with the object of the journey. The writer goes into every nuance of everything even remotely related to the subject. Words, words, words and more words. I finally gave up and I'll be selling this book back on Amazon soon."
3,"A far too big ""Trouble""","This is a classic case of overkill. Had Lukas just stuck to the story at hand and recounted it in three hundred or so pages, he would have had a classic on his hands. Instead, he attempts to include every little detail and historic figure in the America of the last century's first decade. The story itself is quite powerful; a former governor assasinated by labor activists and the subsequent attempt to railroad union leaders. Too bad it drowns in a turbulent ocean of unnecessary detail."
4,"Not a bad debut, It'll grow on ya","These guys call themselves Halfway to Hazard because they are from my hometown of Hazard Kentucky. Tim Mcgraw must have really liked these guys to take them under his wing and produce their debut cd. The current single ""Daisy"" really didn't get enough playing time to give it justice.It's a really good song and these guys really sound good together. Great Harmony on their honky tonk songs really give ya something to tap your feet too.Give them a try, they are good. There is some language on the cd that might offend some people which was a bit of a shock to me but people these days are always pushing the limit. I'm gonna support my hometown boys cause well, ya know, they are from home but honestly I would have bought the cd anyway if I had heard it first or at least had a review to read that gave it a decent review. So there ya have it, buy it and support these guys. Hell they are touring with Tim Mcgraw and Faith Hill and their audience is getting a treat live."
4,Thorough and balanced picture of Willy,Good biography about man who treated his parents Fritz and Vicky very poorly but was with his grandmother Queen Victoria when she died.His belligerent and bellicose nature did nothing to quell emotions and tempers in the period prior to the outbreak of World War I.His physical deformities really messed him up as a child from which he never recovered and which plagued him with self doubt and anger. The book was very balanced in its treatment of him and attempts to remove the generally accepted position that he was largely responsible for the First World War.
2,More a timeline than a biography,"Clearly Giles MacDonagh did a great deal of research for this book. It shows on every page. Unfortunately, what we get is more a straightforward, day-by-day description of Wilhelm II's life than a real biography. Very little background information or interpretation makes it onto the page. As the bones for a first-rate biography, it seems to be excellent. But I was left with no real understanding of the Kaiser or his critically important times. Perhaps someday Mr. MacDonagh will revisit the text and flesh it out into a real biography, rather than a ""facts on file"" type of timeline. Clearly he is complete in his research (after a while, I began to think that he could probably tell us what the Kaiser had for breakfast on October 13, 1911) but the book lacks real style and needs a good editor."
1,Politics with No Personality,"I picked up this book on recommendation from my dad, a history buff much like myself, and was extremely disappointed in it. Instead of dealing properly with the Kaiser himself it spent the vast majority of the time discussing and analyzing German politics and political figures active during the Kaiser's reign and made only the most fleeting references to the personal life of the Kaiser (or anything to do with him personally, for that matter). It's as if the author was too afraid to delve into the private life of this controversial figure because he knew that the bright picture he put forth of the Kaiser would be blown to pieces. Needless to say, this book should be entitled ""Politics and Political Figures During the Reign of Kaiser Wilhelm II.""Go to another book if you are looking for a true biography of Wilhelm. This one will only disappoint."
3,Not exceptionally relevant,"I live in the area of the Dolores River. This had some interest to me because there are many Anasazi ruins within a few miles of where I live.This is basically a collection of 8mm movies taken by a small architectural crew back in the 1970's.There is no narrative. Most of the time you have little idea of what you are watching.There were some interesting comments made on the sound portions. For example, when trying to locate campfires, they used a magnetic anomoly detector. That is something that I thought was fascinating.There is no editing. Most of the footage is of the young archeologists excavating a few kivas. There were some interesting commentaries about the geology of the area and how it related to the pre-collumbian's anasazi occupation of the area.In all, this is worth watching, but, I am not sure it is worth paying the price."
4,great CD,"This was a great CD. After hearing him perform some of these songs live, I just had to go out and buy the CD. Highly recommended."
