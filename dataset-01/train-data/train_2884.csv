5,Classic Sound of Mahler from LPO,"Tennstedt has his unique ways and skill of engeenering the sound of Mahler's symphonies.Personally, I enjoy this CD set of Symphony 1, 5, 6, 8 and 9"
5,Exceptional all in one unit!,I purchased this unit about 1 month ago and I have been nothing but impressed by it. To get the full effect you will need to hook up a external subwoofer. The sound is exceptional and the fact that it is a all in one unit makes it even more appealing. It would be nice to have more than 2 sets of inputs though.
4,Works great and less filling!,"This is a great product! It performs as advertised and I am very pleased with my purchase. It is a great improvement over my standard TV speakers. Having said that, it's performance is definitely enhanced by being hooked up to my existing subwoofer. And be sure, if you already have a great surround sound system, this product will not produce sound of quality as good. It will however, remove the clutter of the many wires and speaker space needed in your room. And only ONE controller for the TV, Speaker and DVD player. All in all, a great tradeoff! And oh, by the way, Amazon's price was so much cheaper than any place else, don't bother looking anywhere else! Larry"
2,"OK, but really not very good","This system sounds pretty good---for a three channel system. We have a rectangular room with reasonably reflective surfaces, but the surround features of this unit really don't work at all. The center/left/right front channels sound good, but surround is non-existent. Don't buy if you're looking for something with surround. I wasn't satisfied; it's going back."
4,HDMI vs Optical Audio Input,"I am looking to assemble a HDTV, Blu-Ray player and speaker set that will last me for the next 3 - 5 years. I was initially drawn to this speaker based on reviews, but have one question.It is my impression that the speaker itself is awesome, but that the lack of an HDMI in/out compromises the potential of the speaker to deliver the best sound from an HD source. In other words, sound coming from a Blu-Ray or cable box loses some signal through the digital optical cable, which would otherwise not happen with an HDMI cable. Could people please comment/educate? Is the lack of HDMI inputs the reason for the drastic price reduction?I have not had a chance to compare audio coming out of optical audio vs HDMI, and so do not have a basis to establish if holding out for HDMI is worth the extra money that that might entail.Thank you."
2,"Okay book, but not as good as its competition","This book is alright, but a bit outdated (9 years old). However, the new competition has better illustrations, concepts, and information, making it more enjoyable for the children and the adults. Unfortunately, ""My First Book About DNA"" isn't on Amazon yet, but you can find it via a search engine by searching for the title. Hopefully Amazon will pick it up soon!"
4,Decent product,"Works well but does rust if you use in saltwater, even if you flush and dry properly (which is a challenge with a multi-tool product)"
5,Great item...,Gave this item as a gift to my dad. He said it was great. Said he has used it many times and loves it. It is a good weigh and balance.
4,Easy to use running log.,I really like my running log so I am able to keep track of how I am doing. It is not complex to use at all.
4,Running Log,it has a good size...blank weeks so you can start at anytime...sturdy construction...to the point headings...and filled with tons of extra information..
4,Does the job as advertised,Excellent product - as good as more expensive brands and have I have no doubt it will hold secure when I need it to!
2,Not as expected,"I bought this book, going off the other reviewers, and being a huge fan of Francena Arnold, and various others she has written. I don't know what it is about this book, I just can't seem to get into it. I have tried on numerous occasions, and it just can't keep my attention. If others have said that it's a good read, I am sure it is, maybe just not for me. It's a shame, because I love good Christian literature, and enjoy many types of books. Maybe I'll give it a shot another time."
5,book reader,I love stories about grandparents. I am one and it is the best feeling in the world. The book was full of wonderful stories about the things we do as grandparents. Also some stories gave a different take on how to handle different situations. i think every grandparent should read it and picture yourself in the book. This is one book I will keep and read it again and again.
5,WOW,This stuff works really well on our oleander caterpillars- they're gone with one application two months ago and they haven't come back!
1,Did Nothing To Stop Grape Leaf Skeletonizers,"This product did not work at all for my grapevines that were besieged by grape leaf skeletonizers. Earlier this summer, I noticed the adult moths laying eggs on my vines so I bought the BT concentrate and sprayed my vines every 2 weeks with the recommended dosage. When the eggs hatched, I faced a massive infestation and the larvae were not dying as advertised (even after repeated sprays). After several of my vines were eaten bare, I had to remove and kill the hungry larvae by hand which took hours over the course of several weeks. After I killed them all, I doubled the recommended dosage to 1 tablespoon per gallon of water to prevent another outbreak. Well, 2 weeks ago, round 2 came with a vengeance and the larvae ate every leaf off of my remaining vines. They were once lush and green, but are now stripped naked. I will never buy this product or recommend it to anyone."
1,Think twice about using Bt products,"Btk (bacillus thuringiensis var kurstaki) may be a naturally occuring bacteria in the soil, but only at extremely low levels. Spraying this stuff on your trees will expose you, without good protection, to inhalation risks. It is also not safe to ingest at all. The fact that it is approved for organic agriculture does not mean it is safe; people exposed to Btk sprays can have living and reproducing Btk in their sinuses for months, may get serious diarrhea, and most importantly, may be exposing themselves to an unknown risk of disease. No long-term studies have established the safety of Btk. Besides, it will kill any moth or butterfly larvae that land on your tree. For tent caterpillars, try cutting the infected branches off and drowning the tents in water overnight. For a very thorough and scientific treatise on the dangers of Btk, see[....]."
1,Not for Chihuahuas long haired or short! or any dog,"The style is very cheap, its extremly loose in the front (its probably why they dont show it) the dress feels cheap. that pretty bow with rinstones the bow is so thin and can easily be crooked..im considering throwing this out"
4,The see through,"I gave four stars to the book but I give five to Gerard Depardieu. Through it I was able to affirm my admiration for the actor, realize the other side of the so called Oscar and the american media and to know a very good writer."
4,Dark Horse,"Eric Himan's voice is as moving in person as on this CD. His sound is soulful, upbeat, and authentic all at once. I highly recommend trying this CD. You won't be disappointed."
2,Back Pain Issue,"This machine did not work for me as I got severe back pain lasting for a week upon using it. I followed the product manual by not bending too forward in initial weeks, adjusting seat position, and keeping back straight and verticle. However, I still got back pain.I returned the machine.Definitely check for back pain if considering this machine."
4,Evocative and Maddening,"I had a very hard time making it through the first volume in this collection, American Girl, for Cantwell's overheated writing and frankly maddening romanticization of her family and small town (and hero worshipping of her father). I think that I am glad that I did - now in Speaking With Strangers I cannot put the book down, though I still want to shake Cantwell out of her worship of the past, passivity and paralysis. But I still can't put it down - a fascinating study of life in New York when jobs were plentiful, rent was cheap, and young people were up and coming (and journalists and magazine writers made enough to live on well). However, American Girl still reads, to me at least, as science fiction - how could anyone have seen nothing but warm fuzzy perfection all through childhood and not wanted to see the wider world more than stay at home as Daddy's Girl?"
2,Do your self a favor and just read American Girl.,"Cantwell should have stopped at American Girl. She is eloquent in her writing, but comes off as a self-centered whiner with too many contradictory feelings in the the second and third books. It was a pain to finish the triology. Stick to American Girl."
3,Ridiculous,As the story evolves it becomes more and more ridiculous. It is mildly funny. I have admired other roles played by Martin Clunes but I lost interest in this about halfway through.
4,Great for College Seniors!,"As a career counselor working with many seniors I was very interested in diving into this book after meeting Elizabeth Freedman at a workshop. I read Work 101 in just a weekend and couldn't have been more impressed. Elizabeth has a great way of organizing the book, easy to read, and kept my attention the whole way through-- very entertaining for a book on professionalism! PERFECT for anyone entering or new to the work place-- her writing style and examples are exactly what our students can relate to and learn from!!"
1,Kindle version is more expensive than Peperback!,"How can it be that the digital version is more expensive than the paperback?The Kindle version is supposed to be cheaper. It can't be printed, lended, or reselled to a used bookstore or college library. Please fix this!"
1,Fake of course,"I didn't actually buy the product but was tempted. Like someone said, there's a really good youtube video on how to tell the difference between real and fake MAC. I could tell in the pics that the name of the foundation nc/nw etc was on a sticker and MAC usually prints that on the container(the box). So once I saw the sticker in the pictures I had a feeling it was fake and after reading the reviews, it looks like this might be a fake. So I'd be careful!"
3,Foundation,I usually dont wear makeup but lately I feel it a must due to small dark spots on my face. But for some reason this color is a bit too dark for me and my skintone but it works during the summer time. I just recently understood that you should wear different shades of foundation; one for the winter and one for the summer due to your complesion changing with the seasons. I also realized with some research the difference in wearing MAC and that is: look at your veins..if you see more blue..then you are an NW..if you see more green your a NC. I also noticed that NW 45 works on me as well because I have more yellow than red. It is the most common shade for brownskinned/dark skinned women. But that is just my opinion....LOL!
1,"Not good, not MAC","I have serious doubts that this was in fact a MAC product. Case came broken, too. I would not recommend."
5,i like it!,I am going to start buying my mac from here all the time. I also got my mac when they said i would get it and that is awesome
3,i love my coverup,I wasnt sure what color of the numbers i am... so i went with this one bcus its light but it came and it was actually really dark..
1,get it right....this is fake!!!,"mac studio fix powder DOES come with a sponge applicator. Other items like eyeshadows and eye liners do not come with any type of applicator. the item pictured is NOT authentic, not because of the sponge, but because of the packaging. I have been using mac for about ten years and i KNOW what its suppose to look like...this packaging is all wrong. Please do not waste your money if you are trying to buy real mac. If you're ok with fake mac, then more power to you."
5,coverage is amazing,"I use this and a concealer because of my redness...but other than that, I love it. and for an added bonus I spay on a makeup finisher so it lasts longer on me. came nicely packaged and not broken."
1,Wrong color,"I ordered the right color. The code on the back matched the code on my current makeup. However this is a good 3 or 4 shades lighter that what I needed. I was very disappointed and unfortunately, was travelling when it arrived so when I got back it was too late to return...DOUBLE very disappointed. Seems hit or miss with this seller. I would not recommend unless you can go exchange in a store as soon a you get it (if there are problems)"
1,STAY AWAY!,"Slight disclaimer, I have been using Bare Minerals for the past 3 years and was looking for a powder that would give better coverage (I am prone to pimples and have a lot of freckles). One thing this powder is GREAT for is coverage...which is good, because after using this for a few days, my face broke out and has been a train wreck ever since. I just switched back to Bare Minerals and am already seeing an improvement.Bottom line...don't use it!"
1,Incorrect item shipped,I ordered NC40 and received NC30. As well this was a knock off and I did not anticipate on receiving a knock off.I intended to order a real MAC product.This formula has a distinct odor and is blotchy when applied. I would not recommend this seller.
1,Realy this was not a real M.A.C.,unfortunately the product is not a real Mac. The color is different from the true NC40 existing store MAC. The smell is not good. Never buy here again.
2,Too light,This product gave no clear way to determine the shade. When I ordered it I ordered the darkest shown and it stillwas too light.
3,correction to one persons comment,"Actually I am a frequent buyer of MAC, in fact all my make up is from there, and I go to nordstroms to get it from mac, and i am a frequent buyer of studio fix and it does come with a sponge so from the picture, it does look authentic, even thought i would never buy it through amazon. very sketchy..."
5,Love my Mac studio fix!!,I received my mac studio fix foundation as promised by the seller! :) It is what I was looking for to wear during the hot season. It is a light wear and does not run or make your face look dry. I love this powder and look forward to ordering more mac products in the future.
1,Feels heavy & cloggy,"If you are looking for coverage & nothing else than this is for you. but if you want something that covers & feels good on your face, dont get this. It makes my pores feel clogged, feels heavy on your skin & i have had some breakouts using this which i rarely ever breakout. I have dry skin. All in all i love mac but strictly lips & eyes anything else i wont take my chances on suffocating my skin."
4,MAC compact online vs. retail counter,"Still a good product in comparison to buying directly for mt he MAC store, I've been lucky in that respect since I've been trying to save some money in buying them from a 3rd party online. The only difference I see is in the dryness or how the outside layer of the compact becomes a texture that is difficult to work with. The dryness could be from the oxidization that comes over a period of time. Maybe this is why the compacts are less expensive, maybe they have passed their prime??? I don't know, but so far so good- if you can be diligent about the way you use the sponge or brushes when applying and try not to introduce waters or oils that can counteract the awesomeness it should be ok but I should mention I go through my compacts about every 6-8 wks so if you don't use them that quickly you may want to op for an in store purchase."
1,THIS IS A FAKE PRODUCT1,"NEVER EVER EVER does mac include an applicator in a product, let alone a sponge! DO NOT BUY, THIS IS NOT AUTHENtIC AND YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE INGREDIENTS ARE, it could give you a reaction or rash!!!!!!"
2,It's just not right...,"Powder is a different consistency than when I buy at a store. Maybe it was due to the shipping, but the powder started chipping out of the compact right away and is so much of a mess that I have to store it upright in a plastic bag.....Don't waste your time, just go to a store."
2,powder seemed old,The powder I received seemed old. I received it not too long a ago and already its coming loose in the compact.
1,FAKE!!!!!!!,I HATED THIS PRODUCT IT WAS FACE MAC PRODUCTS THAT ARE REAL DO NOT COME WITH A BRUSH AT THE BOTTOM THEY COME WITH A SPONGEYUCK I SPIT ON THIS PRODUCT
1,fake,ok so fake mac. first of all mac doesnt come with mirrors on the top of the package. and second if u want tp buy maac get it off maccosmetics.com and the reviews that say it is amazing. they r lame bc they dnt kno this is fake seriously its obvious. i woodnt buy this because u dont kno what it is made out of. so get it of their actual online store or go to a store. or counter
1,FAKEEE,"NEVER EVER EVER does mac include an applicator in a product, let alone a sponge! DO NOT BUY, THIS IS NOT AUTHENRIC AND YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE INGREDIENTS ARE, it could give you a reaction or rash!!!!!!"
1,THIS IS A FAKE MAC,"MAC ALWAYS NAME THEIR PRODUCTS NOT JUST NC20 AND ALL MACS DOESN'T COME WITH A SPONGE APPLICATOR, IN FACT MAC PRODUCTS DOESN'T COME WITH APPLICATORS SUCH AS SPONGES, BRUSHES FOR EYESHADOWS. THIS IS A FAKE MAC."
3,Am I missing somethine here?,"The Frames have been around for almost twenty years. They have a cult following in Ireland. The Frames are going to hang in there forever until everyone has heard them or bought an album. They are waiting for U2 to ask them to open their next world tour. When fans are singing along with such hits like ""Relevate"" you feel like you are at a fanclub show. They are a mix of folk and punk with some literary influences. You would think you were at a religious revival hearing songs like ""God Bless Mom"" and ""Santa Maria."" In the United States, people are stating to pay attention. They are touring with Damien Rice. We will see if it catches on."
3,truth in advertising,"This book by David Ingraham is exactly what it says, debunking pagan traditions that have seeped into the church. I recommend every Christian (and true historian) to consider the previous book review on this title and ask yourself: What is this person requesting and why? This book does expose several of the traditions we have come to ignorantly follow. Also recommended: ""Come out of Her My People"", and ""Too Long in the Sun"". You will never say Merry Christmas with the same feelings again."
3,A Tad Schizophrenic !,"I gave this book three stars because it does correctly point out many pagan customs practiced during these socalled Christian holy-days. The author also correctly portrays these practices as wrong, given the fact that these customs had their origins in the worship of false gods. However, the author betrays himself when he suggests that these holy-days can safely be kept as long as these trappings are dispensed with and only attended to with truly pious sentiment. The problem with this reasoning is that truly pious sentiment can only rightfully be drawn from the pages of the Holy Scriptures. In the Bible the keeping of these pagan holidays are not even intimated let alone commanded."
1,Book breeds intolerance...,"The book is an attack on the role that pagan traditions have played in the celebration of Christian holidays. It is scripture-laden and somewhat historical, but the author drops the ball with inaccurate stereotypes of pagans. This book most definitely does not belong with the other pagan books it was found with. Amazon.com, categorize your books better and give a description if the title could be misunderstood. It is an afront to paganism and the beauty it has colored Christian holidays with. So, if you would follow this author's view and ditch Halloween, Christmas trees, and the easter bunny, I pity you."
2,Mercenaries Don't All Go Around Unshaven,"Congo Mercenary is a good start on learning about mercenary life. The author gives us aa positive view of the soldier for hire. His pride in his military correctness is refreshing. As an officer, he insists on proper military dress and decorum. The material is ample, though not always significant; the descriptions are set-pieces, but a welcome break from the galloping narrative. A lot is said that could have been left unsaid, and much is not said that would have been interesting. Nevertheless, it did hold my attention because it was about a far away place at a time when I worked at the U.N., knew about the conflict, and had to deal with unruly Congolese delegates."
2,Wouldn't recommend,"It came spilled coz the lid came off somehow, not completely but it's so annoying to get your stuff ruined... Besides I am not the fan of the smell. I wanted to give it as a present to someone but can't coz it leaked and looks used :("
4,"I can't believe they left out Solomon's knot, broomstick lace and the loopy stitch!","This DVD is exactly what it says and nothing more. I was recommended, by Leisure Arts customer relations staff, to try it when I wrote to enquire about broomstick lace and the boucle or loopy stitch. It does very well by the advanced stitches but doesn't even approach the expert stitches. Since I knew how to do the stitches demonstrated on it I wasn't much help, but If you are trying to learn how to make bobbles or popcorn or any other bumpy stitch, it will be well worth the money. It demonstrates the stitches in such a way that you can go at your own speed. When you are done with the programs you will have a ""sampler"" afghan. There are other suggested products you can make on the disc as well. There is a pamphlet of printed pattens included with the disc."
5,Pacifica Great Performances of All Mendelson's Quartets,"In this great CD, the Pacifica quartet -- one of the most talented and expressive current string quartets -- gives ALL of Mendelssohn's quartets not only accuracy, but supurb expression as well."
2,the ship who won,"Just not enjoy this story as much as all the other stories about ""the ship who ---"". Just could not get into the story."
3,This particular story lacked mystery & overall excitment.,"While the story brings you into the realm of brain/brawn books, it lacks the mystery and overall excitment that Anne's other ""Ship Who Sang"" books have. I was bored with the Brain and bored with the Brawn. Dialogue for both was predictable and at times drawn out. The beginning and wrap up of the story was good, but the meat of it, left me lacking in curiosity. I am a big fan of the Ship Who Sang series, so I am disappointed in this collaboration"
3,fair,"The brain ship concept is intriguing and I come back to it again and again, but this one wasn't worth it. The ""magic"" and coincidences are too hard to take. I loved the ship who searched and of course, who sang, but this fell far below her best. She should write more and collaborate less, or spend more time on it."
3,"What happened, Anne?","I love the ""Ship Who Sang"" series, and have read all of them (more than once). I can really say, without a doubt, that this one and the city who fought are my least favorites. I hated the way the story unfolded and I really hated the ""part two"" books that were written without Anne McCaffrey.This book is only better than ""the city who fought(which is really bad),"" and lacks soooo much when compared to ""the ship who searched,"" ""PartnerShip,"" and ""The Ship Who Sang.""I can not reccomend this to anyone..."
3,Great if you use palm,I bought this for use with the CVS camera hack... DON'T DO IT! I'm sure the cable works for it but it is NOT as easy as they made it seem back in 2008...
1,"HEARD OF USB, PALMSTER?","I received this last Christmas from a generous friend. As I began unwrapping the gift and almost immediately began to feel that I may have really received what I'd wished for. It was then exclaimed to me, after I had removed enough wrapping to see just what I'd wanted, ""It's guaranteed to be totally USB compatible!"" After I found NOTHING that looked even remotely like a USB connector in the box, it ""rained"" the rest of the morning with broken showers ALL EVENING LONG. My initial anticipation was appreciated but by the time everyone was absolutely impossible to HotSync the m100, my generous friend was angry to have made such a high ticket purchase (for a friend I think you'd agree). Palm, you ruined my Christmas 2000 with your short sitedness and the untrained sales reps in places selling your product. The thing completely shut down a few months later, just when my scripting ability had become nearly second nature. I'd give it ZERO stars if the option were available."
5,I would recommend this!,"I don't have alot of experience with these lights. The friend I hunt deer with, has two. One is a Petzl, the other is not. The Petzl puts out about 3 times the light of the other, so I bought a Petzl. We hike about 20 minutes through the prairie to get where we hunt. Pre-dawn in December usually means cloudy and no moon. If we're going in the same direction, we only turn on one Petzl. It's enough light. For what I paid for it, I'm very pleased."
2,Dry.,"Based on all the fantastic reviews, I thought this book would be a great read and particularly helpful before starting nursing school. It read more like a dissertation and would probably be more useful to clinical nursing instructors or veteran nurses nurses who are unable to articulate their knowledge to nursing students. So glad this is NOT required reading at my school as a previous reviewers have suggested. It was dry and I couldn't bring myself to read more than five pages at a time."
4,Worth reading even if you aren't in nursing,"Yes, it's about nursing. But so much of it applies to any skilled field, and even the parts that don't are understandable, because the book is very concrete. It has interviews with clinical nurses throughout and when you read it, you will understand how it talks about learning, and you will have a hard time not applying it to whatever you do."
3,it is ok,"lots of concepts and etc. not very applicable to nursing in the clinical arena, mostly concepts and apply them if you can."
3,FROM NOVICE TO EXPERT EXCELLENC AND POWER IN CLINICAL NURSING PARATICE COMMEMORATIVE EDITION,"I ORDERED THE BOOK AS A STUDY GUIDE FOR THE MEDSURG EXAM. THE AUTHOR EXPLORES THE AREAS OF STUDY AND BREAKS DOWN THE COMPONENTS OF THE EXAM WHICH MAY HELP IN UNDERSTANDING THE QUESTIONS. THE READING WAS INTERESTING BUT, I DID NOT FIND ANY USE FOR THE BOOK IN AIDING IN HIGHER EXAM SCORES. GOOD READING STILL."
5,Novice to Expert,This book is one of the few available that addresses clinical nursing issues. Very informative.
3,expertise in medical care,"The book of Patricia Benner ""From novice to expert""-Excellence and power in clinical nursing practice, has been very influential in the domain of expertise. The public and politicians relies on experts for understanding events and deciding choices. The division between epistemic (explaining) and performing (doing actually) expertise is fully integrated in the Patricia Benner book (see the Differences between practical and theoretical knowledge p2). All the interpretation and proposals of the book are based on the Dreyfuss model of skill acquisition studied initially on chess performances of chess masters. Brenner book is somewhat unique in the interest of building a full practical operative construction. This is a rare detailed applied expertise in the medical area. As written, ""exemplars"" of diverse situations are given, and provide confrontation between rules and real life. A book of interest for all those interested in expertise.Jacques Cabaret"
1,DO NOT BUY - DIFFICULT TO USE,This product does not cut perfect circles. The blade does not fit securely and therefore moves around on the paper when being used. The gripper-sticker that can be attached to secure the arm to the mat makes it impossible to create smaller circles because it makes the blade sit too high on the mat. The mat has no gripper and constantly moves around on the surface you're working. This product was a waste of my money and is being returned.
1,Doesn't work,I took it back right away. The plastic threaded blade holder strips very easily and then the blade does not hold in place. Bottom line this product is poorly constructed and poorly designed and it doesn't work for very long. Don't buy it.
1,Horrible,The center pivot slips so that there is no way to get a good circle. Wish I had read the reviews before buying this at Michael's. Do not buy!
1,"HORRIBLE PRODUCT, CAN'T BELIEVE M M MADE THIS FOR SALE???","I RECEIVED THIS AS A GIFT LAST WEEK, SINCE IT IS A TOTAL PIECE OF JUNK, I DECIDED TO CHECK WHERE IT CAME FROM AND HOW MUCH IT IS. THIS ISN'T EVEN WORTH A $.50 CENT PIECE LET ALONE $19.95??????? THE MAT IS FANTASTIC FOR MANY OTHER USES, BUT THIS CUTTER IS HORRIBLE, THE GOOFY THING MOVES ALL OVER AND NO WAY CAN YOU OBTAIN A CUT. I TRIED 4 3 & 2 INCH CUTS, THE ONLY ONE THAT CAME OUT LOOKING CORRECT WAS THE 2 INCH ONE. THIS IS GOING TO GO INTO THE CRICUT WASTE BASKET AND I AM ONLY GOING TO KEEP THE MAT.THIS IS NOT WORTH SPENDING YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON, I AM GOING TO SEND ""MAKING MEMORIES A NOTE"" I HAVE MANY OF THEIR PRODUCTS WHICH ARE FAB, BUT THIS IS NOT. SOOOOOOOOOO DISSAPOINTED. I FEEL SORRY FOR MY FRIEND WHO SPENT OVER $25.00 SINCE SHE ORDERED IT AND HAD TO PAY FOR IT ALONG WITH SHIPPING. D O N O T P U R C H A S E... A L S O A W A R N I N G, IT CUTS FINGERS BADLY, I KNOW IT CUT MINE, THIS IS MADE LIKE A CHILD MADE IT. REALLY J U N K!!!!!"
1,Worst Tech Support Ever,"I just renewed my Avast yearly subscription and had trouble from the start. Immediatey after renewal, the software began blocking incoming mail from previously unblocked senders, not allowing pop-ups even though I authorized them, and blocking my ability to see pictures of products on safe Internet sites. The first troubleshooting call yielded me an uninformed technician in India who didn't have a clue and took almost an hour. The problem persisted and my 2nd call to India, lasting over 2 hours, yielded no results. In fact, after 1 1/2 hours, it finally occurred to the technician that he might want to remove and then reinstall the software. By then, I had had it and called customer service for a refund. Also, note that Avast has discontinued free tech support - you now have to pay for what I believe will be a frustrating and wasteful experience."
3,Wild Kingdom!,Put a petite woman in a rabbit suit and turn the blood hound loose. Prescott creates a serial killer with lots of psychological insight. Maybe more than a casual reader would ask for. The story gets started with a shudder then moves into a perilous journey that makes you wander if the ending will be good or good-bye for the gal. Best to read when you have some free time and can read it in one sitting. It's easy to read and hard to put down. Where is the hero to save the day?
3,good story but badly told,"The book started out ok. However, the author lost focus half way through and kept it dragging. I had a hard time finishing it because it got so boring. And when you think where is this thing going, he wraps up the whole story in under a chapter. the climax especially was terrible. Its too coincidental, suddenly that everything goes just the right way. Suddenly Kaylie is out of the haze, suddenly she has the strength to take down a nurse and a tech, suddenly the cop has a revelation ... all this in under a chapter.I wish the author took time to think through how he wanted to present the story.Its almost as if he realized half way through, hes out of things to say and then realized that the book was becoming too long and decided to end it this way.Its an ok effort but not good enough."
4,"Great, once you get into it!",When I first starting reading this book I found it didn't grab me. But after a few chapters I found it hard to put down. You just need to give it a little time to build.
2,stealing faces,"Apart from a few inspired moments, this book was just full of waffle. I had to skip read to get to the end. very diapointing. But you can not win them all."
3,Mediocre,"I'm really not sure why this book has garnered numerous favorable reviews. In fact, I'm at a complete loss to relate the gushing descriptions to the book I read. Don't get me wrong. The book is not bad, but it fails to rise above mediocrity. And it certainly failed to live up to the expectations set by the reviews. I didn't find it to be the riveting thriller I expected. It certainly was not a page turner, since it barely kept my interest. While the characters development was okay, I would not describe it as fantastic. I don't feel the plot contained fantastic twists and turns. Would I read another by this author? Probably not."
5,A real page-turner by a very good author.,"Michael Prescott is the brightest new star in the suspense genre. ""Stealing Faces,"" his second novel, has a complex plot, but the reader never loses the thread. Kaylie McMillan has been on the run for 12 years with almost no one to turn to for help. And no one believes her fantastic tale of intrigue and horror about John Cray, one of the most believable villains in fiction. The book is a page-turner with a satisfying conclusion."
2,Extremely long & overly contrived,"I really, REALLY, did NOT like this book. It was absolutely ridiculous. One stupid plot twist after another, and for what? You know who the bad guy is, and if you pay attention you know within 150 pages what the ""twist"" will be. I'm confused by people who think this was a good book. My thought upon completion was that the editor should retire. Worse still, in the after notes, Michael Prescott says that if you go to his website, you can read a deleted excerpt from the book. There was MORE???? It's almost criminal how long and silly this book was."
3,"Author talented, but story too graphic for me","I enjoyed reading ""Riptide"" by Michael Prescott because I was pleasantly surprised by how the story wrapped up.""Stealing Faces"" is too graphic for my enjoyment-- along the lines of ""Silence of the Lambs"". If you read to relax or escape, I don't recommend this story.I wish Amazon would also allow for rating of violence, sex and language.A good Mystery is a great brain teaser; but I don't want to horrified, repulsed . . . I'm not one of those people who like a good scare."
4,A Riveting Thriller,"The author, Michael Prescott, is exceptional at building tension. This is a riveting thriller that kept me in suspense right up to the very end.Stealing Faces is definitely not for the squeamish. After reading the prologue, I was not sure I could continue, but am glad I did. The novel is set in Arizona, and refreshingly, the killer, a published author and psychiatrist, is revealed in the first chapter. Another unusual aspect to the novel is that the detective is only introduced a third of the way into the book.Twists and turns abound, as the predator hunts the prey and the tragic backstory is revealed.Stealing Faces is an easy, fast read that's sure to please."
3,Okay buy,Great price. But I didn't really fall into the book like I wished. I found myself kinda skimming instead of reading it cuz the book just wasn't that great.
4,Clever but a bit predictable,"The main historic weakness of all crime story is the ability to avoid its natural weakness, predictability. It is either who done it, or will they be caught and how, these are the obstacles when we write crime and fugitive novels. So now that I have brought up the books main flaw the four stars I gave it are deserving since the rest of it is very good. There is some of the very best imagination I have read. The structure is perfect, the characters are well intro'd and lively, never boring. The fact is this book is so well written I felt a little fleeced concerning the predictability. One powerful strength covers the one weakness. This author has many books which I have read one other and I see bestselling talent for certain. I do recommend it"
5,Love this author!,I can't seem to get enough of M. P's thrillers. He reads easily and the stories are fast paced. Really glad this is just fiction. His characters could be so real! I usually think his books would make good movies.
5,JUST READ THE BOOK!!!!!,"This book was AMAZING! There wasn't a single dull moment within it! I was so impressed with the book, I'm off now to buy another book by Michael Prescott."
1,Not worth the buck,"This book was not worth my dollar unfortunately. The story was predictable, average and very long winded. None of the characters were fleshed out enough to care whether they lived or died. One of the cops in the story had a 'huge' back story added when he stepped on the scene (to further the plot) but it seemed weird, out of place and unneccessary. Although this book has a lot of 'great' reviews and a pretty interesting write up it was not worth my time. I will save my 'bucks' for other authors....."
1,Yuk!,"I like mysteries, and this one received so many 5-stars that I decided to give it a try. After just a few pages, I decided to stop. Truly gross. I don't need those images in my head. There is enough horrible stuff going on in the world without adding this. I might have persevered for a few more pages had the writing style been captivating, but it isn't. Standard fifth-grade-level sentences just don't do it for me anymore. I won't be adding any more books from author Michael Prescott."
4,Page Turner,"This book is definitely a page turner. It will keep you on edge, anxious to continue. The author brings his readers as close as I ever want to be to a serial killer. I think Prescott was brilliant in the way he told the story - weaving in and out of the killer's mind and eyes to the victim's mind and eyes. It's unsettling but a thrill to read."
2,"Middling, at best","Pretty boring story, actually. Not at all gross or bloody, though,as suggested by a couple negative reviewers. Just kindo of plods along but I have to say I stuck it out 'till the end. You will have to overlook some extremely implausable sequences."
3,Good Read Despite the 3-Star Review,"Good enough read, rather long and drawn out however. I found myself losing interest at various points, but the author did manage to reel me back in. Cray of course was an interesting pyscopathic, but annoyingly over the top. Of course in the end, his own arrogance was his undoing. Kaylie, I liked but she started off pretty weak, and of course througout the course of the book had more than a few ""dumb"" moments. Detective Shepherd was pretty cool, typical of most cops in that they don't believe anything without so called hard proof. Overall it was a good read, I give it 3.5 stars and would still recommend it. Just be prepared for a long read."
4,Great concept!,"This book definitely has a great storyline; it did take me almost to the last page to figure the whole thing out. Without giving too much of the story away, you are going to be hooked from page one when you read about Sharon Andrews murder. I was troubled by the fact that Kaylie was trying to catch a serial murder on her own, and kept thinking to myself why is she not going to the police? Well later on in the book you will see why. I was terrified when the killer got a hold of her the second time, and I was impressed by how manipulative the killer or Dr. Cray proofed to be. Lots of twists and turns and a great heart pounding ending. But if you have a weak stomach you might have to skip a few pages..."
5,Reminds me of Thomas Perry/Jane Whitfield novels,"A terrific bargain in Kindle books and certainly, a decent read. He writes well and manages to create suspense despite some pretty well-worn plots. Rather typical twisted serial killer with a sick obsession, but Prescott keeps the plot moving along well and maintains a good grip on his characters, who are, for the most part, sufficiently unique to hold the reader's attention. As in the title, the female protagonist recalls the ever-resourceful Jane Whitfield from Thomas Perry's novels - another writer who treats the language with respect and the reader. Overall, and given the price, these books are a terrific find. Gonna snap up the whole bunch before Amazon raises the price."
5,Stealing Faces,This was the first Michael Prescott book I had read. I loved it!! I was hooked from the first page. It was also the first book I have read on my kindle so that made it a double bonus. I am a die hard James Patterson reader and was looking for something comparable. I think Prescott hit a homerun with this one.
2,Is it over yet?,"My father and I both happened to be reading this at the same time on our readers and started talking about the book... both of us wished we'd just quit it. The story dragged on and on, with cookie-cutter characters and no real surprises. I'm still struggling to finish it, although every time I pick it up I consider just moving on...."
3,so-so,"The story line itself was pretty good, but the book could have been cut by 50 pages with endless internal dialog. Fair at best."
3,Suspenseful Quick Read,"This is the third Prescott book I have read on Kindle. I liked this better than Shiver and Mortal Pursuit. These books are much like reading an episode of Criminal Minds with the exception that the police are generally portrayed as dunces and the ""target"" is always lacking in self confidence, common sense, and the ability to turn to anybody else for help. Still entertaining and again proves that good always prevails over evil."
1,horrible,"I've never felt the need to write a review before, but this book was such a waste of time. Completely immature and shallow philosophical base, which is too irritating to overlook. Author clearly thinks he is much, much better than he is.... although apparently he seems to have fooled some people. Maybe I'm just somehow missing the point. Struggled to make it halfway through the book before giving up and deleting it. Garbage. At least it only cost me $1 on kindle...."
5,Very suspenseful...,I found this to be a very good book with an interesting storyline and plot. I will look for books by this author in the future! Very talented writer!
1,No Substance,"We don't have ANY idea why the killer kills, in fact, we only read a few pages about his crime. We then spend the rest of the book chasing the killer with people we know nothing about. Because we didn't get enough insight, it was hard to care what happened to anyone."
1,Revolting,"If Amazon would accept no stars, that would be my rating. This is perhaps the most egregious example of misogyny I have ever had the misfortune to encounter. The author needs his head examined. I gave up in disgust after 30 pages. Do not buy this book and thereby encourage more of the same"
4,Excellent! Suspenseful!,It has been a while since I read a fiction novel I could not put down. The suspense begins on page 1 and does not end. I deffinately recomend this one.
5,Stealing Faces,Michael is one of my favorite authors and he didn't disappoint me with this one. It's a real page turner.
5,Excellent,"Stealing faces was one of the first of Michael Prescott's books that I have read. He is now one of my favourite authors.Stealing faces was thrilling, exciting, frightning, suspense. What a story! This will keep your attention right from the start all the way to the last page."
4,It's a winner!,"John Cray seems to be a nice and very scientific man, only on the inside he is sick, twisted and crazy. He has been hunting, yes hunting, women. He is the predator and they are the prey. He's unstoppable, until a young, blonde headed woman begins to make him feel insecure.Michael Prescott has stunned me and other readers with his slick narration of a somewhat haunting story. Just a warning, if you're squeamish at the smallest thing you might not want to read it, although I'd advise you to suck it up and turn the first page. It's written beautifully and will literally keep you on the edge of your seat, long after the ending. Three words for this winner of a story, amazing, amazing, AMAZING!"
4,A sense of menace,"To start with let's get one thing out of the way: yes it was an improbable storyline. So if you're looking for naturalism, look elsewhere. But the whole point about a good thriller is that it should be about the suspension of disbelief. And this book certainly delivers. A cat and mouse struggle, twisting this way and that, it has tension all the way. Kaylie reminded me in some ways of Lisbeth Salander (in Stieg Larsson'sThe Girl Who Played with Fire (Millennium Trilogy)et al. But this is not a flaw, just my personal reaction to the character. The cat and mouse struggle also reminded me of the cyber battle of wits between Andi and ""Llanosea"" in David Kessler's legal/psychological thrillerNo Way Out."
4,Interesting suspense,Really enjoyed this captivating novel. The only problem is that there are lines missing from the e book every couple of pages. Please fix this. It detracts from enjoyment of the book to have to guess what the missing words are.
4,High-quality headphones,I have owned these headphones for 5+ years now and they are still working fine. Awesome audio quality and comfortable to use. I like them because of the durability. I would recommend this product to anyone who enjoys and cherishes good sound quality.
1,picture is not accurate,"Beware - you are not getting what's in the picture. You are getting 25 2-packs (50 total) of 4x4"" gauze sponges, not rolls of gauze. I was originally searching for 4x4"" gauze sponges and came across the link to this product with a description of 600 pieces (I figured it was the equivalent of 600 pieces of 4x4"" gauze but in roll form). I thought that was too good to be true for the price, but I thought I'd give this a try anyway. It was indeed too good to be true. Oh well. I ended up having to order more 4x4"" gauze from a different manufacturer at a much lower price than this product. On the plus side, they did send out the shipment quickly."
3,Socks for volleyball,"My HS volleyball girls chose this sock to go along with their uniform. The socks looked great, however, they weren't 'knee high' on some of my taller girls (5'10). In fact they didn't even fit their full foot, and we ordered the larger size. So I had some girls with the socks well up to their knee pads, and my taller girls with them to their mid-shins. Our other teams ordered similar socks from the same company, just not off of Amazon.... and they fit perfect... not sure if I just got a bad batch of socks or what..."
5,ethnic charm,"Nicely made, reasonable price, authentic design. If you enjoy decorating with, or wearing an ethnic look- you will enjoy the products from Curious designs. This will make a nice gift. I ordered several different pieces, and all were lovely and creative-looking."
5,If you like anime (shoujo) then watch Greenwood,"These 3 videos are my favorite anime series, actually my favorite movie series ever! Its got humor, action, tender moments, you name it. The animation (if not top notch) is great, and although the dubbed version was rather poorly done, I reccomend it for casual viewers. In short buy this, buy it NOW! and enjoy..."
1,I really tryed to like this book,"I bought 2 books when I tryed to grasp xml, this one, and XML in a nutshell by O'Reilly. I don't know why other people think the Microsoft book is good. It says it gives fast answer to most questions regarding xml but I always found my answer faster in the O'reilly book. After a while I just put the Microsoft book on the shelve to collect dust and my O'Reilly book is full of post-it."
2,"Easy to use, but bad power off","The camera works well, has really nice fit and finish. It's light, easy to use, fast, and straight forward. The lens is protected by a sliding door. This is kind of cool. You open the sliding door to turn the camera on in ""capture"" mode. When you open the sliding door, a motor extends the lens out from the body about .5 inches. This is all great.HOWEVER, to power off the camera and return to ""review"" mode, you slide the door part-way shut. The problem is, if you're not extremely careful, the door jams into the extended lens, and the lens _skids_ back into the body against the door. Once the lens is fully retracted, you can close the door completely.I gave it two stars because all the goodness of this camera will be useless when your lens motor burns out because the lens was rubbing against the door.The Camera's great, but it's door/power switch design has much to be desired. I will be returning this camera."
2,Great for a While - Then Froze Up,"Camera took great pictures! Fell in love with it - until the day it froze up - Olympus suggested new batteries, resetting the camera, and nothing. You will also have to invest in a USB Reader to expedite working with the pictures.Have sent it out for service, but noticed a lot of retailers no longer sell this model (hmmmmmmmmm).Will get this one back - but may invest in a new, other model camera soon."
5,Fits in my cargo pants pocket,"I've had this camera for almost a year and it's had very very heavy use. I do a lot of work in the field and this camera ""folds"" down so that it fits easily in my front pocket (cargo pants, not jeans). The slide close over the lens is perfect for protecting the lens, the flash disappears into the body. Unlike the other reviewer(s), I've not had any problems with the software; I moved to rechargeable batteries fairly soon after I bought the camera, however, I never used to LCD screen much as I have to look at my subjects (eye to eye) to photograph them; I'm never ""behind the camera."" That I could just set the lens to wide angle and shoot from the hip has been a breeze with the mighty-mite. Only quibble is with the noise the lens makes (wide-tele); that is, I prefer an almost silent adjustment...However, for most, I'd think the very solid sound of the barrell changing from tele-wide-tele, would be satisfying, and good feedback."
2,"Good camera, bad design","The camera works well, has really nice fit and finish. It's light, easy to use, fast, and straight forward. The lens is protected by a sliding door. This is kind of cool. You open the sliding door to turn the camera on in ""capture"" mode. When you open the sliding door, a motor extends the lens out from the body about .5 inches.

3,"Nice camera, but no USB card reader!!","The camera works well, but I applied for the USB card reader in December & have yet to receive it (It's almost April now!). If you own a Macintosh, you need this device. Without it, you cannot download the pictures. I'd suggest you look elsewhere if you are needing a card reader. (I have called the rebate line numerous times... they just say ""it should be coming soon"")."
2,Just terrible,"The design of the the D490 is just great. Easy to operate, and good results. The problem is the Camedia software. I tried downloading off the CD-rom on two different machines. When trying to open the software it announces a fatal error and crashes. Repeated calls to Olympus support were never answered. In the end I just rang sales and got straight through (strange, eh?). They couldn't supply a patch, so I spent another $25 buying the latest version of the software. The camera also doesn't seem to work with Windows XP, which is supposed to pick up cameras and similar devices automatically.I've owned Olympus cameras for 25 years, and frankly I'm disappointed."
1,Olympus may be facing quality problems!!,"I recently bought the D-490 Zoom camera (which is regular in terms of picture quality) and it stopped working after one month. The camera just got off and never came back on. I tried Olympus support in internet and after a week got a message advising me to reset the camera but it didn't work. After some more days (a lot of them) I got the answer that my camera doesn't have a worldwide warranty and that I would have to pay for the repair (or ship to USA) since I live outside USA where I bought the camera. This is the second Olympus defective product I bought in a year, the first was a Smartmedia memory card.In my opinion 2 defects with the same customer in a year is too much. Although Olympus states having a world class service, it's far from it in my opinion. I don't recommend Olympus digital picture products for anyone, specially if you live abroad."
2,Great Camera until it just DIED.,"I bought this camera for my wife just over a year ago. Since then we have had a great time taking wonderful pictures. I cannot complain about the quality of picture or the everyday use of this camera. We absolutely loved it until one day when it simply did not turn back on. We thought we had just worn the batteries down, but it did not work when we put new ones in. We emailed olympus and they told us how to reset the camera, with no luck. The price to have it fixed is the same price to buy a new one now on ebay. We took it to a local camera shop and they wanted $...just to look at it. They said this problem happens alot with these cameras, which is apparent if you continue to read all the reviews. For now we bought a HewlettPackard 715 with 3.3mp. I did not want to take the chance on the olympus camera again, even though we loved it while it worked."
5,So easy to use!,My camera just arrived 2 days ago. It's the first digital camera I've used and it's wonderful! It's easy to work and the pictures are beautiful. Worth the investment.
4,Love the viewfinder,"Unlike practically every point-and-shoot digital out today, this has a viewfinder. When taking photos outside, in sunlight, an LCD is essentially useless. Also, with the D490, I can turn off the LCD and conserve batteries. The D490 uses ordinary batteries that you can buy at any 7-11. The case closing to protect the lens in nice. The photos seem very sharp to me, even though this is only a 2.1 megapixel. The D490 seems to take photos with less delay than many of today's point-and-shoot digital cameras. On the down side, it's easy to forget to flip up the flash."
2,Beware software obsolescence,"This camera is let down by poor support. The software (Camedia) that came with the camera supports Windows '98. My new computer came with Windows XP, which is not supported. On the Olympus web site they state that I will have to purchase an upgrade to XP. When I try to follow their link to obtain the upgrade I am taken to a web page detailing a flash gun, a remote control and a flash bracket, so I am still unable to download pictures. This I find a let down and I would think twice about Olympus if I were to be in the market for a digital camera."
5,Great camera,"We bought this camera just before Christmas, and it has been GREAT! It is easy to use and takes wonderful pictures. The indoors pictures are as good as the outdoors. If anything, I am over-flashing some of the indoor shots because my previous digital camera had such a poor flash. It is really cool to be able to review the photos as soon as you take them. We are very pleased with this product. The quality is excellent and the price is reasonable."
2,Mine locked up after 3 months,"Overall I have been very satisfied with my camera, but after just a few months of use the camera locked up completely and the lens would not retract. I had to send it to Olympus for repair and was without a camera for a few weeks. Olympus had to replace some board inside the camera. When I last used the camera the batteries read fully charged, but while the camera was locked up it aparently was draining the batteries. Olympus sent the camera back with the dead Olympus Lithium batteries in an envelope saying they were dead and needed to be replaced. You would think they would replace them for the inconvienience, but I had to spend an additional $25 to $30 on new batteries."
2,Quality Control Needed,The elastic was out on one side and we had to restring it. The inside had what looked like tire marks inside as if it had been previously used and returned. Not happy at all
2,These didn't fit well for us,"We ended up with a different pair of Bloch Jazz shoes in the end. These just didn't fit right. The arch area was uncomfortable and the back of the shoe kept slipping off. A smaller size was too small. Just could't get a good fit. Switching to another shoe was the only option...not to mention more comfortable in the arch. We ended up going with the Bloch Neo-Flex after this shoe. Those fit perfectly, comfortably, and like a glove."
4,Great Quality but...,"I like the structure of the shoe and the band in the arch is helpful for me. My thing is that may be it's been a while since I've worn jazz shoes but I thought/think that they should be pretty fitted. I am in between a 9.5 and 10 in street shoes depending on the maker, though I typically wear a 10. I ordered these in a 10.5 to size up based on the reviews. They"
5,This book is the bible-I swear!,"Hothead Paison is a classic! She gives the word fe-muh-nist a new meaning! Definitely someone for all of us strapping young dykes to look up to!! Everyone should read the books of Her Royal Hotheadedness, they will give you insight to life itself!!!"
1,Items not included,"Picture misrepresents product. Mud flaps are the only thing included. The picture will lead you to believe that weight and antisail are included, but they are not!Mud flaps seem to be quality, just know that you are not getting what you think you are."
1,Icky-pooh,"If you only LOOK at the cover for this video, you can tell that the lead is no Peter Ustinov, the yardstick by which all Poirot actors are measured:""Death on the Nile"" (1978)""Evil Under the Sun"" (1982)""Thirteen at Dinner"" (1985)""Appointment with Death"" (1988)Tony Randal is a good actor under bad direction; however, he is not the only thing that makes this movie lame. The timing is off, the music is second rate, and it does not even have the continental feel of a British movie.Needles to say that, years later when David Suchet nailed the part that made this bad film unbearable.Story is of Agatha Christie's star detective Hercule Poirot investigates an alphabetical serial killer(s) based on Christie's novel ""The A.B.C. Murders"".Save your money and save your time. Do not watch this adaptation-watch Ustinov instead!"
2,Not for Agatha Christie Fans,"This movie was made during the time when Tony Randall was classified as a ""Movie Star"". Unfortunatly for us Mr. Randall wasn't a good enough actor to be taken seriously by anyone including the producers of this mess.As a result intead of giving us a good murder mystery, they give us bad comedy with a few dead bodys thrown in. The late great Robert Morley did his best with the throw-away part he was given, but his efforts are not enough to salvage this farce."
1,A Person Of Specialized Tastes Who Thinks This Is an Abomination!,First off I feel I must point out that I love British movies and that includes the British period costume movies and the British Mystery Murder movies which includes the likes of movies based on Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot and Miss Jane Marple so nobody could say I don't have specialized tastes! But I honesly feel that Tony Randall is a very miscast Hercule Poirot! He is a fine comic actor in American movies and TV shows but just can't pull it off as the main character in a British Whodonit! It's just too ridiculous!
1,New Ravel Orchestrations CD,"I was disappointed in the performance of the orchestra and conductor on the newly released CD, although I had read a favorable review of it in Gramophone magazine."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in this product. I purchased this DVD as a surprise for our kids for an upcoming roadtrip. The ""new"" story, ""Larry Learns to Listen"", was just a new song. I wasted my money, because we already had the other 2 stories. I felt it was misleading."
1,Don't think it's new! Title is just a Song.,"I also was disappointed in this product, but not as much as my son was. I purchased this DVD for him, a life long veggie tales fan. The ""new"" story, ""Larry Learns to Listen"", was just a new song. I wasted my money, because we already had the other 2 stories. It is misleading."
3,Good for young children,"My younger boys liked this when they first got it. Now that they are a little older it doesn't have any allure for them. It doesn't help that they have older brothers with more challenging games. If your kids are young and just beginning with the video games, this is a good one for them."
3,Fun but frustrating,My son received this game for Christmas. He is stuck at the flat top tunnel and cannot go to the next level which makes it very frustrating. I have even tried to and am having difficulties. I really like the game because it's not violent and interesting. Unfortunately my son has lost interest because you can only ski on top of a train for so long.
3,it was fun,its a cute game. i played it on the gameboy advamce sp..its cute but a little boaring you could falla sleep.
5,Super-Excellent,"""PRAIRIE: A Natural History"" (second edition) by Candace SavageCandace Savage has done an absolutely phenomenal job with this book. It is coherent and eminently knowledgeable. It is comprehensive and yet thorough. It is wonderfully ""readable"" and beautifully illustrated. It is, I'm certain, a book that John Muir, Aldo Leopold and Rachael Carson would all be thrilled to read. Any reader with even the slightest interest in the prairie world will find ""PRAIRIE: A Natural History"" a delight.I have one serious criticism to offer, however, though not of the text or author. The book was printed and bound in China and, to me, that is extremely disappointing."
5,Prairie: NOT the Great American Desert,An excellent book. Well written and scientifically accurate. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is enchanted with the beauty and grandeur of the North American prairie.
5,Andre,"I was surprised at this performance. It is much better than I expected. Jay Rowe seemed not to be big plauer of smooth jazz so far, but I think he will be fron line. I'm looking forward to listening to his next CD."
3,Cuisinart HFP-300,Too much food remains in the part that does not detach. I shred carrots for my husband and I loose a good bit of the carrots that are left in the machine. The space between the cutter and the casing is where the carrots gather.The cord also does not retract easily. I have to actually push it back into the machine.
5,Smooth As Silk,"With the dulcet sounds of Tony Williams on lead, THe PLatters take us back to the romantic sounds of the 50s. This is a ""must have"" for anyone who grew up in that era or who wants to immerse themselves in the smooth harmonies of that period in music history."
5,Wonderful group...great songs!!!,These songs really bring back memories from the 50's and 60's. A lot of songs for the price with definite quality sound.
5,Excellente!,'p d harris' said everything there is to say.... but I'd just like to agree with him.Fabulous fabulous cd. I can't stop listening to it. *swoon*
4,The Platters,Great music if you enjoyed the 50's like I did. Brings back a lot of old and fine memories.
2,Slightly disappointing,"Had hoped for 'more of the best'. It was okay, we have listened a few times. Meh. Guess it was a small blast from the past."
4,Platters CD,CD was in good shape but the case was cracked. No big deal. I ordered a used product and the condition was good.
2,musicor years m3p,"I give this album 2 stars only because The Platters recorded some great bilboard pop songs for the Musicor label in the 60's that we danced to; I love you 1000 times, With this ring and Washed ashored to name a few. I do not like the endings of these songs that the Mercury label rearranged ........ especially I love you 1000 times they cut off the best part of the end when he was wailing Wheeeee i I love I love I love you baby every every time i write a letter i think of you......Pleazze Put the original Musicor recorings on m3p or i pod I see these original Musicor songs only on certain albulms in Amazon (that can't be downloaded). Everywhere i search on line for the Musicor years of the Platters these recorings are not avaiable for m3p or ipod. Whats up with that?"
4,A lotta punkin seeds!,"Taste good and serve to keep me away from unhealthy snacks when I'm peckish.... but this is a HUGE package, obviously for a retailer. I put 3 packages in the freezer and we'll see how they fare later."
2,disappointed,"The ones I received were mostly yellowish in color with some light green instead of dark green, dry and somewhat stale, they may have been in a warehouse longer that they should have!"
2,Very poor quality pumpkin seeds,"Prior to purchasing this brand of seeds, I had always used the NOW Foods brand (which has generally been a very consistently good quality seed from my own exprience). This being my first try at using a different brand turned out to be a very big mistake. I usually purchase seeds in bulk, so I purchased 4 bags of these seeds. To my surprise, every one of the bags contained small, brown or discolored seeds, all of which are not the healthful green full flavored seeds that I was used to with the NOW Foods brand. Hey, I'm not a spokesperson for one brand or another which is why I wanted to try a different brand to compare. However, in this case, I blame myself for thinking the proverbial grass was greener on the other side....I couldn't have been more wrong in this case!.... I will never buy this brand again!"
3,Good quality and well packaged.....,Bobs Red Mill Pumkin Seeds came to me in a great box..and inside the box well packaged and extremly secure shelled seeds.I cannot say enough about the quality of the packaging--a really nice thing for me--because it takes some time for me to finish them all--and they stay fresh and secure because of the special care taken in the packaging.The quality of the seeds themselves is very good. They are uniform in appearance...well shaped...appetizing..and healty looking.The price here is totally right for those of us that need more closer to a bulk level of foods. These came in a multipack carton.These are not only items by Bob Red Mills --there are many--and if grains and nuts and seeds are in your diet..your childrens diet or even your pets diet.....then I cannot recommend this line enough to you--for fresh ....healthy eating !Try them !
5,Delicious! Try these before buying other brands,"If you have tried pumpkin seeds in the past chances are they have been heavily salted, seasoned and deprived of most nutritional value...or had the taste and consistency of styrofoam. Fortunately, neither description applies to these. They are indeed raw but removed from the hull for easy eating. No added salt or other nuisance chemicals - just delicious and nutritious snack. Mix with raisins and/or sunflower seeds for a healthy snack rich in zinc/other vital nutrition or use with breads, cereals and flavor for your favorite recipe."
5,Barenboim's brilliant playing makes sense of all sonatas,I already have the whole set played by V. Ashkenazy; it is well done and enjoyable. But I have to say that Barenboim is a genius. When music becomes complex - and Beethoven's sonatas do become very complex - Barenboim's subtle phrasing makes it totally understandable and exciting while Ashkenazy's performance prompts my admiration that he can play all the notes perfectly.I ordered the set from Entertainment Magpie Limited (in the Amazon list) on 12/1/11. The message from Amazon confirming the order says that it will be delivered 12/23/11 and 1/9/12. But I received it on 12/13/11!
3,"Sweet, civil Beethoven","Barenboim's performances of the Beethoven piano sonatas in this collection make for easy, pleasant listening. The slow passages are played affectingly, and occasionally go beyond prettiness. The rapid passages will not offend, though now and again one has the sense that technically Barenboim is not quite up to their demands.There is no Heaven-storming here! A listener who knew Beethoven only through Barenboim's interpretations would never understand Liszt's remark about the Menuetto in the ""Moonlight"" sonata, that it is ""un fleur entre deux abi^mes"".All the same I find Barenboim's performances oddly engaging, and I listen to the recordings now and again. Pleasant - cocktail Beethoven, if you will."
2,dead in the water,"Sorry, I just don't like Barenboim's renditions. Beethoven is my favourite composer, depending on my mood that is, and nothing moves me as his music can. But I just don't get Barenboim's renditions... doesn't do a thing for me. Something of Beethoven's depth and richness gets totally ""lost in translation"".Better off finding a better performance of these if you really want to be ""blown away"". My favorite ""Beethoven"" conductor would have to be Herbert von Karajan; and as for individual pianists my all time favorite is Maurizio Pollini, whose performances are exquisite, in both technique and expression! If you are a music lover you should really check his work out if you haven't already. My favorite Beethoven CD by him is ""Die Spaten Klaviersonaten"" (Beethoven) by Deutsche Grammophon in their ""legendary recordings"" series. It is a real gem! (the sound quality is excellent also)"
2,Bored!,"I was new to Beethoven when I bought this set. Upon listening, I honestly thought I did not like Beethoven or piano music for that matter. I was not able to even listen to one whole cd because it was so sickeningly distasteful. I just bought Friedrich Gulda's complete set and I cannot get past the first cd because I keep listening to it over and over again. So, in conclusion, if you are new to Beethoven and happen to buy this cd and not like it, try another one."
1,Not authentic,"This product is not authentic. Everything on the outside of the case looked real but the inside was totally not MAC. I brought it into a MAC counter and they confirmed the powder was fake, even the shade was not NC35."
2,Eh.,"Ok, so i love MAC products and i have a few that my mom bought me for school. I was so excited to get the stuff on but when i put it on it came out cakey, no matter how little i put on. It's just gross.I also have the liquid kind thats a very good product but it broke me out soo bad, i'm 14 so this was a BIG deal."
1,I received a fake MAC product!,"I ordered mine through lowpricecosmetics- and it is a fake. Smells different, different size application pad, not even the correct shade! I have been wearing NC35 for ten years, and when I opened this product, it was orange! The sticker on the bottom of the compact is on upside down and the entire compact is lighter than a real MAC compact. Be careful when ordering these online! I am filing a fraud claim."
1,not original product,I am very disappointed the product i received expected a quality product not a cheap chinesse copy I hope an explanation from you
3,It makes my face look dry,"Did not liked it much...When I wear it, gives me a dry feeling on my skin. Doen't feel natural to me."
3,Difference,I received mac studio tech when it was supposed to be mac studio fix. Any one want to explain difference?
2,Hmm,"I'm certain that this book will help anyone who reads it. However, with all of the praise that it's received over the years, I thought that this book was going to be crazy cool with over the top advanced riding advise for the experienced rider. It's not that book.Now that I said that,.. Buy it anyhow. Read it. Then pass it to a friend. It doesn't hurt to be reminded of some of the riding tips that you already know. And I'm sure that you have several friends that NEED to read this book. I just passed it down to my Wife and Son, and it they read it, I got my money's worth!"
2,Basic skills,This book is Basic riding skills only in this book. Please don't buy if you are looking for advanced riding.
5,Fine inexpensive edition. Other review is for audiotape!,"This is a fine, inexpensive edition of one of Stein's two most readable productions (the other being 'The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas'). I'm giving it five stars because the item's star rating has been impaired by a reviewer who's reviewing an audiotape, NOT the signet paperback book on this page."
1,"Not good Gertrude, not good anything","Do yourself a favor and listen to Gertrude Stein reading Gertrude Stein, before or instead of listening to this recording. Enjoy Ms. Stein's crisp diction and the wonderful rhythms of her prose and prose/poems. Hear the way the sounds cascade through the phrases and the way the phrases become the meaning.Then, if you must, listen to this Flo Gibson set. Possibly you won't listen to much of it. I disliked it intensely. The reader appears neither to understand nor to like the material and reads with unremitting dullness of diction and unrelentingly pedestrian rhythm. In an apparent attempt to give some workaday meaning to Stein's rippling, dancing phrases, many words are heavily overemphasized, like an extremely bad and condescending reading of a children's book. But do remember --you may not react as I did.The reading is not helped by pops and hissings, especially noticeable and intrusive on the beginning consonants of most syllables."
1,Chiropractic based on experience not heresy,"It is amazing that someone could be published with so little proven group study and with such outdated information. I have experienced the wonderful effects of corrective chiropractic treatment and am a believer due to personal experience. Cervical manipulations on my severely damaged cervical spine caused rapid recovery of hearing, vision and speech. Although I am now in a maintenance period I still believe that my chiropractic adjustments are what keep me running - I choose to be well and not base my health on SYMPTOMS which are mainly misleading. How many people do you know that have dropped dead due to a sudden heart attack, rare cancer, a stroke and never had one warning sign or symptom? What a load of bosh this book is and I feel I actually got stupider reading it."
1,Looking inti being a Chiropractor,I am very dissapointed with this book. Im 28 yes a little old but have always been interested in Healthcare but not MD. Way to much math and school. This author has no business in this field. He should go back to school and become an MD or a status quo Dr whose only in it for the money helping the greedy insurance or Pharmacy company's. Iv taken Pysch meds and pain meds all my life and what did they do???? get m addicted. nothing more. Luckily Iv found a religion and a frame of thought and I am all for anyone wanting to see a DC or any kind of alternative Dr because these are the guys who really do care about there patients well being and not just the money money money. I applaud anyone wanting to be or has a general DC that they do on a regular basis. Shame on this author for continuing this profession while all hes doing is bashing th hell out of it trying to convince people to not trust DC's or study to be a DC. Shameful!!!
1,This book is harmful to your health,This is an unrealistic biased account of chiropractic by two people who need quite a bit of help themselves. Don't waste your time or money. It is amazing that they found a publisher!
2,Mark Train was right,"Mark Twain once warned about reading medical books, that one can die from a misprint. Had he encounter someone like Barrett, he might have issued this warning: be careful of quack-busters, you can die from terminal misinformation."
4,"A non fiction book on H""",I have read this book and feel that it gives the reader a true non fiction account about Heroin. The underlying factor that I get from it is that it is neither for or against H'. But leaves it to the reader to decide for himself what is best for him. Alot of this information is based in fact that the author has taken the time to find out for himself . Not go to the libaray or online and shift through documented reports on the subject. Then put a book together based on someone elses information or disinformation. And I feel that disinformation can and has been a dangerous thing. It is filled with reliable scientific information and how the legal systym works. Hopefully the reader will never experiance that first hand. The chapter on that is very straigt foward. I recomend this book to anyone interested in the subject or doing a study on it. I give it 4 stars.
3,"Okay, but not as good as the first two.","After finding ""Decision at Doona"" and ""Crisis on Doona"" to be two of the best books I've read recently, I started in on this one with great anticipation. It's hard not to want to read more about Doona and some of the characters we've come to love.The book was generally good and enjoyable, and was time well spent, but in my opinion it was weaker than the first two. The plot didn't seem as well constructed, and some threads were not adequately developed or resolved. I kept waiting for the story to kick into high gear, but except for a few tense moments, it seemed to just coast along.I too hope there are more books in this series. And I hope that McCaffrey (now 73) has given Nye her blessing to continue the series if she dies anytime soon."
5,Funky souly gutsy 70s bluesrock with a sensitive side,"Funky souly gutsy 70s bluesrock with a sensitive side. This is *so* much better than the rather banal first album. The band's sound is quite complex in places and there are few weaknesses in terms of musicianship (*everything* is good). Many tracks are characterized by interesting and unusual changes of key and pace, e.g., the band can go from an upbeat funky style to melancholy in a few bars (Leaves in the Wind): impressive. Most of the songs are about either lost love or love gone bad -- right in the Free / Bad Company tradition. Favourite tracks: Blue Soul; Stop Doing What You're Doing; Sweet Sweet Beauty. This stuff is 30 years old in 2006: they just don't make 'em like this anymore. Its a classic but known to only a few."
4,R.(rock) I.(in) P.(peace),"Paul Kossoff left us 2 early but he left us with some really fine music. This is Koss's last album, and maybe his best, his guitar work is very good, it's too bad this work is not known by a lot of people. Don't pass up this cd if U love the blues."
4,Una gran banda que pocos conocen...,"... pero aqui teneis una magnifica oportunidad de haceros con algunas de sus mejores canciones. Este album recopila muchos de sus mejores temas pero faltan algunos de los mejores, de ahi que solo le otorgue 4 estrellas. Puro Power-Pop australiano en la linea de otras bandas del pais como HoodooGurus, Dubrovniks, etc. Pop guitarrero con melodias electrizantes. Un grupo con un sonido demoledor y con un directo que le pone los pelos de punta a cualquiera (se nota que soy fan?) pero que, desgraciadamente, no cuentan con el apoyo de una gran casa comercial, si no otro gallo cantaria!"
3,"What a pity, not DVD!","I saw this movie several times when young and later on, always on TV here in Austria, Europe. One cannot buy it her, an NTSC-tape might work on better equipments, but in poorer quality still.Why does Disney not re-issue this fantastic document and masterpiece of early cartoons remastered on DVD? Don't they know, what they've got? Can anyone hear me?"
4,"The three pigs, et al.","As an adult I enjoyed watching this video with my three-year-old daughter; she loves to watch this video over and over and laugh and giggle. We both found many parts of the video funny and laughed together, however some parts frightened her as there is a bit too much violence at the end of the video. In some cases I feel kids can get ""ideas"" put into their heads from watching the video; there is one part where the kid wolves are chasing the pigs with meat knives. If you get this video and have very young kids, sit with them for the first 4-5 times the video is played and explain to them that it is just a cartoon or make-believe."
3,BEST SELLER FOR A 3 YEAR OLD ( THREE LITTLE PIGS),"I HAVE A 3 YEAR OLD GIRL. THIS VIDEO IS EXCELLENT FOR A CHILD TO WATCH. MY LITTLE GIRL WAS SO EXCITED WITH THIS MOVIE. SHE WATCHED IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN TO A POINT, I HAVE TO BUY A ANOTHER TAPE. BECAUSE SHE LITTERALLY WORE IT OUT."
3,Violence Violence Violence!,"My two sons ages 4 and 2 love this video. I however, am wondering what all this violence is really teaching them. Grandma is chased out of bed and the third skit with the German wolves is really frightening."
2,Makes a mess every time,"Even at the lowest setting, with only two cups of liquid and holding down the top hard, the result of turning it on is a counter sprayed with the contents. The liquid basically explodes against the top and, if it's hot, will burn your hand as it squeezes through. It also leaks when you pour.The only redeeming qualities are the price (...) and that it does otherwise work (i.e. it liquefies, blends, etc.). So if you don't mind cleaning up after it, it's OK."
1,Quickly broke under ordinary use,"After only a half-dozen uses, the the round white piece that connects the glass pitcher part to the base, called the ""jar base,"" cracked, making a mess and rendering the blender useless."
2,Black & Decker Crush Master,"Plastic parts on blender -iie cogs which ""join"" the Base to the cylinder have started to wear out after less than a year.. Black ""specks"" are visible when disconnected and the ""wheel on the base is ""chipped"". It has been used every morning to make a ""smoothie"" - fresh fruit only.Surely this product should last longer than this !"
1,Dewalt 14.4 battery replacement,I bought one of these and one genuine Dewalt battery at the same time. This one is not even close to the genuine battery. It will not hold a charge very long and does not last nearly as long in normal usage compared to the Dewalt battery. If the Dewalt battery is more money it is for a reason. It is worth the extra money to buy the Dewalt pack VS this one. I would not buy this brand of battery pack again.
3,Doesn't fit B&D,This battery did not fit my Black & Decker drill. There is a guide key at the top of the stem that is in the center of the shaft. My original battery has a guide key that is offset from center. I suppose it fits DeWalt...
1,Shorter Life than Dewalt,"I bought 2 of these, one alreay will not hold a charge and the other does not last long. Disapointed, I was hoping for something better than the short lasting Dewalt ones."
1,Academically oriented read...not for what I had hoped,"An academic approach to faith. Not a ""feelings"" book. Would recommend for critical reading but, not for insightful faith building."
1,An absolute DISGRACE,"I read this book at my Grandparents house as a child and it is enough to put any small child off religion for life ... I am a case in point.Examples of text include ""what if a great box was to fall from the sky, it would crush your little body and you would die but if you believe in God then he will save you"" OR ""what if a great knife was to run through your poor little body ...."" I won't go on but it continues in this vein throughout with the quotes above and other such pleasantries .... !All in all I think it is absolutely disgusting that this evil and absurd book is still in print!I believe it should be burnt and certainly not showed to any young child who would probably be absolutely terrified!In fact you could argue a case of child abuse these days if you tried to instill this sort of rubbish into a young and vulnerable mind!If relgion is about terrifying people into believing then I want no part of it!"
2,Slowgoing Series,This is the second audiobook in this series I've listened to and still find it hard to work up much enthusiasm for Chief Constable Harriet Martens (not sure if that's her correct title). Harriet's constant doubts about her judgment and hunches drive me crazy! However did the woman get promoted? Maybe I'm just too used to the confident inspectors of Martha Grimes (Inspector Jury) and Elizabeth George (Lynley and Havers). The problems those characters have are with their personal lives and not police work. I do like Harriet's husband who ought to be on the force. Even her new DC is a basket case of nerves! I'll try a third book and see if it's a charm or strike out!
2,Too Tragic an ending of our life in the universe,I did not like his analogies of the turtles of Costa Rica and ancient Dinosuars whom are now extinct. Old ships and the Universe is a big comparison. Our Universe is very old. Everything changes this is true but I think we can do better then run down buildings. Brians conclusion is that in the future our sun will explode and the universe we live in will become extinct and all life will completely dissapear. Whats the point of finding life in our Universe if we are not going to survive anyway? If Brian really believes his own theories. why don't we spend the tax payer monies on us instead of space exploration that has a doomed future according to Mr.Cox
3,Uncle Anesthesia,"The first story of this book was a gripping read. I enjoyed it very much. He and I had far different backgrounds and grew up in a completely different world but at times Crews portrays his feelings and world and makes it both common and familiar. I highly recommend the first story of the book. The others do not get such high regard. They are worth reading but very strange. His imagination got away from him, I think."
2,Your DVDs will be scratched,"This is in no way a review of the movies included in the collection, but entirely based on the packaging faults.When I received this, six of the DVDs had come loose from their pockets and had been terribly scratched. The DVDs are not kept in cases, and are not in any way locked in. They are instead slid into pockets on a fold-out DVD case. There is nothing to prevent the DVDs from coming loose, and the pockets do not secure them tightly to start with. Needless to say, I had to return the product.If you really want this, I suggest buying it somewhere you can be sure that the discs are not loose from travel.I've never felt the need to write a review for anything I've purchased from Amazon before, but I had to in this case."
1,bad bad discs,all the disc watched so far are bad.. stop 1/2 and freeze no matter what I do. The discs are bad
4,Great CD to explore Cello Music,"The Elgar was performed so beautifully and so was the Bloch. The huge pieces were carried with viruosity. Iserliss is a great player and this is largely apparent in the shorter Tchaikovsky pieces (Andante Cantabile, Nocturne, Pezzo Cappriccioso) because the phrases were so charming and you just let the sound of the cello melt in your ear. This is an awesome deal so buy it and be careful where you leave your CD because a minor scratch keeps me from listening to the Kabalevsky Concerto."
4,Better than the HotSync Cable!,"I recommend this accessorie for you Palm M100. It's better than the HotSync Cable since it gives you a place to put your Palm. But I only give it 4 stars since it should have came instead of the HotSync Cable when you buy the Palm M100. I really do not understand why you need to buy the Cradle in the Palm M100, when in the other Palms is not an accessorie. If you have the money and want to have a base station for you Palm M100, then buy it......if not, then I recommend you to stay with the HotSync Cable and save your money for other accessories."
1,PalmOne m100 HotSync Cradle,"It took me a few weeks to find the adapter from the 9 serial plug to the USB port on my portable computer. Now, the docking station is already out of commission. The HotSync tell me that ""the connection between my handheld device and the desktop could not be established"". I brought it in to our local computer service store and apparently the cradle is dead. Therefore I can't use my computer agenda and transfer the data to my Palm Pilot and it's not worth going through the hasle of sending it back to the US, so not a good review for this item."
4,Book review,This book provides a thorough basic understanding of natural attenuation processes. It has useful and simple examples and should be the first port of call for information on this topic.
2,Not very revealing,"Stripper Lessons is the story of a two-dimensional nerd going through some personal growth thanks to a two-dimensional stripper. Most of the details and subplot are more tedious than anything else. There were a few things mentioned in the book that seemed outdated for something published in 1997, leading me to suspect the the author may have had this manuscript lying around and was able to publish it only after the success of Leaving Las Vegas."
2,Not all with TS use it as an excuse...,"I was very disappointed that the author spent so much time using TS as an excuse for his immoral lifestyle. I'd rather not have read about his sex life & drug use.The book almost seemed to give the impression that all of us who have TS (yes, that means me too) go around living this way.The book actually did have a few pages that were worth reading so I gave it two stars rather than one."
5,The diversity of human beings,Twitch and Shout is a treasure of sharing. I love to share Howell's feelings and experience.I'm touched by his sensual touch of every person living with Tourette in his book. I can't forget the pain having a fragile present for a beloved is broken because of a twitch. I can't forget the noise and joy in the wedding. I can't forget the victory when the drug is to continue to manufacture.May the humankind be diverse. We are human beings.
3,Offbeat Book,"This book is pretty interesting in a wierd trivia, adventure-seeking sort of way. I bought it for my husbands high school academic team. He won't be able to use the entire book for them, as there is a lot of inappropriate material in the book: Picture of dead, naked woman [from Bonnie and Clyde Museum], the Mentruation Museum?, and a stripper museum."
5,My kids love these,"My 7 and 9 year old love these movies! They own many of the Hero Factory toys and it brings their toys to life. We also have younger kids, and they are a little dark and scary for the 2 or 3 year olds, in my opinion."
5,2 movie,my son love these movies he watches them over and over again in good shape it was like brand new
1,T T,One of them is played well. But other is not because of region code.T T Please note about region code for customer who doesn't live in USA.
4,Very Acceptable Product,I was in Research and development for over 30 years developing copier and laser toner. I worked with many remanufacturers of laser catridges including testing and qualification of product via ASTM testing protocol. I can say that this product is very acceptable and would recommend this product. Good Job!
1,Not a blood sugar enhancement,i've been giving this to my husband since he is diabetic type 2 and it hasn't done anything. I thought it just might work but no success
2,"good concept, not so easy to use","I loved the colors and the idea, but it was pretty difficult to slide anything into the card."
1,DO NOT BUY! Waste of money.,"Fortunately, I only had to pay seven dollars total (including shipping and handeling), but this game is TERRIBLE.A) THE ONLY THING YOU CAN DO IN THIS GAME IS TALK TO AND CHEER UP TOWNSFOLK AND TOURISTS. That and the silly mini games that are boring after the third time you play. Other than these few things, you can sleep and buy items (even then, there is not much variety in the items. A blue, green, yellow, or red chair. A blue, green, yellow or red closet. A blue, green, yellow or red bed. You get the picture.)B) THIS IS NOT THE WII GAME! I was so disappointed to find a lack of building houses and furniture. As a matter of fact, there was no building whatsoever. I LOVED the wii game, and I wish I hadn't gotten rid of it. So, I was hoping that this would be a pocket version of the wii game, and it is NOT."
3,Why play a game if it's only fun AFTER 5 hours of play?,"I don't know if it's because I'm not a huge Animal Crossing fan, but this game pretty much stank out loud. Very slow, not engaging at all. Basically you walk around and talk to people...mini-games get unlocked very slowly, and weren't terribly fun. I expected SOOOO much more from EA, and I'm a HUGE fan of the Sims/Sims 2 but this game is just plain bad. The Wii version appears to be much more dynamic, and probably worth the $$$, but the DS version, not so much. Buy it used, if you must try it for yourself."
2,Meh.,"So, just like everyone else, I was extremelly excited to try this game out since I'm a HUGE fan of Animal Crossing. And sadly, this game very much dissapointed me. Animal Crossing is SO much better in many different ways. I just hope the Wii version is way better. Unless you have TONS of time on your hands and don't mind a VERY slow moving game, then this game is for you. You can't personalize your town like they advertise (perhaps in the Wii version you can). But I wouldn't suggest buying the DS version, if you have a Wii, the Wii version is the way to go. I was hoping the game was Wifi like AC, but the only way you can play in someone elses town is if they are in the same room with you with another DS. -snore-"
1,Boring!,"The DS version is absolutely awful. I bought both the DS version and the WII as it looked interesting. The promos are for the WII version. I actually bought a WII just to play the WII version of this game. I'm completely sastified with the WII version, but the DS needs to be avoided."
2,Not so good,"I too, was excited about buying this game. It's not even close to what I expected it to be. It moves really, really slow. The interactions you have with town people are boring. You only have so many emotions to choose from. With PC Sims when you make someone mad,you get a little giggle out of it, with this version you ""have"" to make friends to earn $$. I feel like I'm forced to get along with everyone, or I won't make it farther in the game.I'm sure if I stick with it, maybe something will amaze me. Like when I get enough cash and can buy this mansion. But getting there is like torture, lol.It's nothing like AC, not by a long stretch. AC you have a lot more freedom.I played this game a total of 3 days. I've been playing AC for a year now, and have yet to put it away. I agree, the Wii version has to be where all the fun is, its certainly not this one."
5,I enjoy this game,"They should make more like this one. This game and MySims Kingdom resemble one another too much so if it could have a different storyline, that would be more fun."
4,A fun game!,"Well, first of all, what the description says isn't true. You dont get to build and customize your town. I dont know why it says that but you cant do that. But overall its a fun game. I think making leis is really fun once you get fast at it. You can catch fish, take pictures, play raquetball, and make friends. I'm 11 yrs old and I really like this game. I would recommend it for a kid who's 8-12. :)"
2,Bleh,"This game has been sooooooooooooo boring so far. They mayor continuously tells you to do things and more tourists will come and businesses will thrive and so on and still the pace of the game never changes. Money is way too easy to come by so there is no excitement in filling your house with pretty things since it is so easy to do. Making the tourists happy is extremely easy, really the only thing that is enjoyable are the mini games but they are definitely not worth the $30 this game cost I'm going to give the game a few more hours in hopes that maybe at some point it will pick up before I go trade it in :-("
1,Disappointing.,"I wish I had time to do a thorough review for this game, but unfortunately, my time and my frustration does not allow.Like many other people, I was completely excited about this game. A cross between Animal Crossing and The Sims? How could I not be!? The truth though, is that this game is victim to false advertising. All the cool things you heard about or saw in commercials, is only in the Wii version of the game. The DS version of the game is nothing more than a glorified mini game game. And the mini games aren't even very fun. You will continue to search around your town to find something to do or a reason for your character to go out and interact with the nameless random people in the town, but there just isn't any reason to.This game is lacking on all levels, and I am disappointed in EA for not at least sprucing this up to the same interaction level that Animal Crossing has"
3,mushy,"Despite the gushing praise on the cover this is not ""hard"" sci-fi in any conventional sense. It's really quite mushy. I read Ventus and Permanence and enjoyed them, but this one is making me re-think purchasing any more of his books."
2,"The Old ""Nothing is Real"" Plot Ploy","After your first dozen science fiction books and movies that constantly rely on the ploy that ""nothing is what it really appears"", the concept wears thin. Especially when a book is packed with virtual worlds, and mysterious and ill-defined groups, whose motivations and relationships unravel one-by-one. It becomes predictable. The technical and social issues are superficially treated (compared to say, ""Permutation City""), and one of the pivotal ones, ""3044"" is unviably lifted from today's video role playing games. My final feeling was that author Schroeder was wandering lost after half the book."
1,Terrible,"I would give this software 0 stars if I could. I use Win2000 and orginally bought the software for Win95/98 after the sales guy told me it would work. It doesn't. Then I bought the correct software for my OS and I was able to install effortlessly. However, I cannot print blank checks or integrate it with Quickbooks2002. I tried the help pages, worthless. I am currently sitting on customer service for the past 20 minutes waiting to talk to someone, who knows when they'll answer? Oh yeah, if you need technical help, it's $... for the first 10 minutes and $.../minute after that. I just hope I can get my money back through their 30-day money back gaurantee. If I ever get to talk to anyone. DO NOT BUY THIS SOFTWARE!!! ..."
1,"Doesn't work, waste of time","My mom spent 2 hours trying to get this to print blank checks. When she couldn't figure it out I spent an hour working on it and looking online for clues with absolutely no help. I had to reinstall it to even get the ""Greatland driver"", whatever that is, to work. Then checks would never print. Total waste of time."
1,My Check Writer Personal DOESN'T DELIVER!,"I have used check writing programs without trouble for a number of years. After a recent upgrade to XP, I bought My Check Writer-Personal because the box said that it was compatible with XP. Loading was easy, designing was more time consuming than I had time for. But the checks would not PRINT. I tried using the help menu and finally had to break down and call the ""fee-based"" help desk. It took several calls and several techs to tell me that they didn't think it would ever work with an ink-jet printer. Apparently the program is designed to work ONLY with lazer printers and the box did not make that clear. Since the product is advertised as a Personal edition (as compared to their business edition), it seems that the company should have made it inkjet compatible, since most home consumers have these less expensive printers. My final advice for home users--don't waste your money on this product!!"
5,A Bowl Full of Common Sense,"Gwen Bobo hit the nail on the head when she wrote Okra Soup. She said a lot of things that people think, but don't say. She tackled an array of topics and situations for men, women and children. Her Boboisms are a must read.The author states that Okra Soup is not a cookbook. But, that book definitely has the recipes to life."
3,Ok for true fans,"Some very interesting stories and facts presented by the author who was there for all of it, so fans will enjoy the behind the scenes look. But he is still clearly emotionally involved with the band and nary a bad word or ill advised story come across. Plus, he is an awful writer."
2,"No Saints, No Saviors: My Years With The Allman Brothers Band","I am a HUGH Allman Brothers fan. Followed them since the late 60s! While the book did provide some insight, I felt it was woefully short and seemed to me to leave out much of the ""meat"" out that I expected. For diehard fan, I guess it's intersting. Would I spend my money again...no!"
5,Great Examples,"The New Brain is an excellent summary of current research and cutting edge technology. It does not go into depth about the different parts of the brain, but it does give interesting examples of how modern technology is affecting our brains. The book is well balanced illustrating the good, bad, and ugly of our current society. It also explores ethical issues that researchers are facing as new technology and understanding of the brain is developed. Fun examples to test some of the theories are given. Some of the activities are easy to translate into a classroom making interesting lesson plans."
5,Excellent and up to date -- at least for the moment!,"This book covers many of the exciting new developments and presents them in a way that is very useful and pragmatic. I have recommended the book to many folks and have had good responses.I found the argument that ADHD may be ""the official brain syndrome of the information age"" a great discussion starter. The presentation on multi-tasking was also quite useful since I often find myself wondering whether that is an effective use of time or not. The description of ""intellectualization"" (p. 73) was also useful for me."
2,Not helpful,"I really love the Crescent Moon grips for hands, so I bought this to help me keep my feet in place on my yoga mat. I wear a size 6 shoe. These socks were too big, making it difficult to really get a grip with them. These were disappointing for yoga--but they are okay around the house."
2,Slippery & Small,"I bought these for my boyfriend, who doesn't like wearing sneakers when he works out. His normal slipper socks are too hot. These seemed like the perfect remedy. They definitely ran small. He is a size 10.5 and the Extra Large just fit. They were even a little too tight. Upon first use, he was sliding on the hardwood floors. The grips simply don't work for the intended application. I am unable to comment on the comfort or wicking ability of the fabric. I'm returning these."
4,sizing!,"I do pilates 2-3 times a week, and wanted good socks. I wear a size 10 shoe, medium width. As with most size 10's, I'm sure I'm used to most socks fitting on the snug side in life. I ordered a large, but I feel like they are kind of big. I wear them, but I have to pull them tight before putting shoes on or I get wrinkles in the bottom. I can wear them, but with the next set I'm going with a medium. I know there's another review that says the opposite, but I am a tried and true 10 in a shoe, and while these work, they are definitely a bit larger then I would ask for."
3,NIce but run a little small,"My husband's shoe size it 10 1/2. If I were to guess, the socks probably fit a 9. He's okay with it, he just yanks them occasionally."
3,Somewhat of a value,These Exersocks work for a little while but tend to slip off. One has to keep pulling them on to stay on feet.
2,Disappointed,After reading previous reviews I thought these socks were just what I needed. While doing some exercises I found that my feet slipped while wearing regular socks and hoped that these would not. While doing flat footed exercises these work fine but for other positions they slip so I end up kicking them off and continuing in my bare feet. I also ordered according to the suggested sizing but these are too small. For the price I definitely would not order again.
5,Great Slippers!,"These were great! Fast service and a very high quality product, great hit at Christmas!"
2,Beware!,"My shoe size is 10. The options listed were S, M, and L. I ordered the large. The sock is an extremely uncomfortable tight fit...more like a medium. Far too tight to wear. Overall quality seems OK though, about what I was led to expect. I have blown $25 on the 3-pack. Proceed at your own risk."
3,It could have been a good investment,"These socks arrived and I ordered them in a medium using their sizing chart displayed online. However, when I received them and tried them on, I actually needed a small. The socks must run large. So, for that I was a little disappointed because I wanted to use them in yoga and the larger size offered a lack of support."
1,ExerSocks Value-Pack (X-Large),"It must be harder than I think for a manufacturer to get the size of sock correct?Obviously they did not try this product on their own feet!The product is well made thick material, but comes out of the bag 1 size too short.Once washed, which everyone does before they wear new clothing, it becomes 2 sizes smaller and is rendered unusable.If you need size 11 or larger do not buy this product, it will not fit..."
3,Exersocks,Very nicely made. They stay on during exercise. However they shrunk a little from dryer. I wish I went for a size larger.
4,Great DVD player for an old model,"Althought this DVD player doesn't have the progressive scan feature, the picture looks better than one that does. When compare to a new Panasonic, the image quality of Panasonic looks artificial and ""digital"". The Pioneer's picture is a lot warmer and realistic.This player is a bit picky about screatches on the media."
2,"Poor Picture, and Poor Remote","I recieved my dvd player only a couple of days ago, and already I am considering taking it back. When I watch DVDs on it the pictures goes dim then gets real bright, repeatly through the hole movie, it is very annoying. To see if it was just my DVD player I played the same movies on a neighbors player and it was perfectly fine. Also the remote has very tiny buttons, and it would help if it was backlit or the buttons glowed in the dark. I found myself getting up, turning the lights on, and missing parts of the movie just to perform a simple task though the remote. There were many features that I liked on it, but I am sure that I can find the same features on any DVD player. I give this a thumbs down."
3,"Does the job, but....","If your dvd is in perfect condition, this player does a fine job. However if your disk has even the smallest fingerprint, smudge or scratch- forget it! This player can also be quite noisy with lots of noise from the drive and the laser mechanism as it tries to keep up."
1,A Disappointing Product,"I am very disappointed with my Pioneer DVD Player DV-333. After playing approximately 20 DVDs during a period of seven months it has failed. I called customer service 1-800-421-1404 and the representative told me where to take the unit for service. A call to the service people told me that it would take ten days to two weeks service if no parts were required and a month if service was required.Obviously the critical parts on this Pioneer system were not burned in. We got an early unnecessary failure. What a waste of money! As an engineer who has acquired over sixty patents and put a lot of products into production, I know this failure did not have to happen. Pioneer has disappointed me."
1,Problems after 20 months of light use,"I bought this model in December, 2000 as a family Christmas gift based on reviews I read here. We used it ""lightly"" - probably playing one DVD movie a week from then until last month. The machine no longer responds predictably to either the remote (with fresh batteries) or the front panel controls. If I try to power it on, there is no response. After 10 minutes, if I try again, the power will come on. Then I try to play the DVD. Again, no response, but if I try again after several minutes, it might work. This repeats for nearly every subsequent command. When I finally give up and try to power it off - you guessed it - it does not respond until I try again some time later. I opened the unit to peek inside, but nothing looks amiss. I will try to contact Pioneer tomorrow, but am not hopeful after just reading other reviews here..."
2,beware the freeze problem...,"As described by users below, I too started having problems after a little over a year of very light use. the machine will turn on fine, and display the pioneer logo, but then will get hung up and not load the menu. if i retry repeatedly, up to a dozen times, sometimes i get lucky and it starts to play.pioneer claims there is no service bulletin on this model, so you are responsible for all repairs. it's a great unit, but considering that i could get a new dvd player for [money], i'm not sure that it's worth the money to repair this."
3,DV-333 requires pristine discs,"I bought the DV-333 mostly to watch rented DVDs on my 20"" Sony TV, not for use in an integrated home theatre setup. I'm happy with the image quality and the controls are fairly easy to use for routine operations. My main complaint, as noted by others in their reviews, is that the player doesn't do well with even slightly dirty or scratched discs. Unfortunately, this applies to 10%-20% of the rented DVDs I watch (I've never had a problem with one of the few DVDs I've purchased for my personal library). I see image and sound break-up and, in the worst cases, the picture just freezes and the player stops itself. In this case, the only remedy is to manually re-start play at a point in the program beyond where the problem occurs. This typically involves some fumbling around with the control to specify a location that loses the least amount of the program.Unless you are playing mostly new or well-cared-for discs, I'd look at alternatives to this model."
4,Exactly what we needed,"The description of this shelf clearly indicates that the center shelf is removable, which we have found to be extremely handy (since we can choose to either use it above the faucet, or separately). We have also had no problems fitting it over any of our sinks. This piece has moved with us through 4 apartments, and has always been wide enough to fit across the sinks (both double basins and single basin designs).Make no mistake, this is not a supremely high quality item, but for the price it gets the job done. We have used it as a plant rack and dish-cleaning organizer. It's great for elevating items off of the wet counter top."
2,Not for standard sinks,"I purchased this rack to grow herbs in my kitchen window over the sink. I should have paid more attention to the size of the unit. This is too narrow to fit a standard 33-inch-wide sink. Also, the middle shelf is not attached to the unit, but rather simply sits on top of it. After spending $7 for shipping on a $13 item, I feel extremely ripped off. Target/Amazon should have made it clearer that this shelf is not really as advertised."
2,Musically different,"Roadrunner records is known to promote really good nu-metal, metal bands but this band doesn't qualify in any of this genres. This group is very different of other groups. If you like nu-metal bands, you won't like it that's for sure but if you like originallity, you'll love it. I wrote this review just to warn you before you buy this cd, that's all. A lot of people were hoping for a Slipknot continuation in this cd but this has nothing to do with Slipknot. It's a side-project of Slipknot's drummer but it doesn't look alike at all. ""To My Surprise"" looks more like Murderdolls but in worse if you won't a comparison but everyone has its own tastes so listen to it before you buy it. Some will find I'm wrong some won't so see by yourself."
1,Ha!,"I gave this record a listen at a store so that I could review it and add yet more fuel to my hatred of the compost-heap that are Slipknot. This here is ""percussionist"" Shawn Crahan's side project, and is subpar middle of the road pop. Good job, Shawn. If it wasn't already confirmed, To My Surprise should finally suggest once and for all that Slipknot are nowt but turd."
4,different....,"its deffinatly different from slipknot... just because one would love slipknot, they dont neccesarily need to like the side projects they have.... but when it comes down to it, TMS has taste, and substance... Oliver Ignatius, why would you waste your time reviewing a band you dont like.... things are never one-sided...."
4,to my surprise...this cd kicks ass,just got this cd today at first i thought it was ok the 2 tracks i heard before get it to go and in the mood are great songs but i really was'nt feeling the rest of them then i gave it another listen wow!! i love it now this is a cd that may take a few listens to get used to if your a fan of slipknot and think this is anything like the other members side projects forget it it's not really metal at all sounds pretty original the only group i could say they kinda sound like is queens of the stone age but not too much and the only reason i gave this cd four stars is because track 5 is awful but besides that it's a damn good cd check it out
3,Oops Nat Cole didnt write..,"Yup Nat ""King "" Cole did not write ""Unforgettable"" It was written by Irving Gordon who also wrote the skit ""whose on first"" for abbott & Costello (page32) Also James Dean was in ""Rebel without A Cause"" but was NOT in ""Bus Stop"" (Cinema page 46) I already noted the Florida booboo..Talahassee NOT MIami...Other wise I love this book. Sincerely. Enjoy reading it again and again..Usually in bed to get sleepy enough to dive in under the covers. Keep up the good work ...but have some editors check and double check the facts."
3,Interesting trivia read and good prep for contests,"Despite a good number of errors, all pointed out in detail in these reviews, I found this an interesting book that had lots of fun facts. Its great for reading out loud to friends to have them guess the answers as well as trying to remember some of them yourself.I used this book as a study guide for a jeopardy tryout and there were a number of answers from this book. You will need to study it in more detail than I did and you hopefully will have a better result. If using this to study for a game show, I would also suggest adding an atlas and some information on popular culture."
5,Astonishing Good Taste!,"For those of you who are interested in the roots of much of the music that's everywhere, this is a perfect starting place. Here are three discs to show you where almost all great pop music, Post World War II, came from. It couldn't have been picked much better. There are vocal groups, jump blues bands, and thank God, some country songs. They seem to have done a great job with licensing and all that too. I had quite a few of these records and got this as a recent birthday gift, but there was still plenty to thrill me.One warning: You'll want to follow up by buying almost everything you can by these great artists. It's a happy disease."
5,Delightful Source of Insight and Inspiration,"This is a very well-packaged book that correlates Biblical scripture with personal experiences. It is another heavily thought out attempt to show that the Bible is for all ages.A verse from either the King James Version or The NIV Version of the Bible begins each chapter and is followed by a combination of fables, tales and accounts of historical events to supplement one's study of the Word of God.God's Little Devotional Book for Graduates is not just for those who either will have or already have exited high school or college . It is for all walks of life. I am a college-level instructor who wants to succeed personally and professionally, and there are times when I need encouragement and direction in making decisions and giving my students advice. Along with the Bible, this and any other references, such as the ones authored by Max Lucado, have given me, I believe, added insight and wisdom."
5,1 of the best novels of K. Stone,"K. Stone is one of our best authors of gay SM erotic literature (if not THE best). He knows exactly how far to go -- or until wich extreme limits we will follow him -- and what his readers hope to find in this kind of books. Do not miss any of his novels -- in particular ""Rituals"" -- and his short stories."
2,Mediocre Effort/Poor Central Character Development,"I found the central character to be boring and hard to care about. Not for one moment did I believe him to be a warrior in anything but title, hung about his neck by the author in an attempt to push a dynamic worthy of much better effort and skill.The erotic moments were flat and worthless. So by my accounts this book fails in both elements. As a sci-fi book and as an erotic book.There is better writing going on with sites like Nifty and others that is free that have better plot, development and eroticism than this book."
3,Was ok thought it would work better,It removed some of the rust but not all of it didn't meet my expectations. Payed to much money for something that only gets the job half done.
2,A little lie,"It's too early to review the effectiveness of this product, but not too early to say - No applicator.The picture and description clearly state that there is an included applicator, well not on mine. Is this the end of the world? No. there are far too many really important things out there to worry about, but like a bad server in a good restaurant, it doesn't help the experience.If I feel energetic enough after using the product I may add to this review, but lately I've been feeling soooo tired."
2,science by anecdote,An interesting topic but the book is ultimately very disappointing. There are far too many anecdotes and not enough hard science -- in particular the interaction of testosterone with other factors such as intelligence or the levels of other hormones is only touched on. The description of the ancestral environment and the role of testosterone in human evolution is comic book at best. The book serves a useful purpose in surfacing the role of hormones in human behavior and demolishing the naive pc supposition that the only differences between men and women are due to education and culture; but leaves the reader wanting more. There is a much better book waiting to be written on this theme.
2,Could have been much shorter,"The author strings together a well researched cache of interesting anecdotes which do a great job a grabbing your attention and illustrating the point. However, he never goes into any of the bio-chemistry of how it all works. So, I guess its more of a sociology oriented book. But it never realy goes anywhere.Factoids like ""men with high testoterone are more aggressive, and more likely to beat their wives etc. etc."" didn't give me much to chew on. I did enjoy the statistic that shows that high level corporate types who have successfully clawed their way to the top are not necessarily high in testosterone, though they might think they are... (they actually ""relationship"" their way up -- which should be good news for women execs). I thought about the execs I know and laughed.Ah well."
2,"Wit, Wisdom, and Empiricical Research!","Heroes, Rogues, and Lovers is a terrific book for those who attempt to stay current with contemporary research within the biological and psychological sciences. Dabbs research provides empirical support for the link between testosterone levels and behavior. Not only is the evidence compelling within this well-written book, but it is funny, witty and reads like a fireplace novel with the inclusion of stories of spit tests gone awry and colorful descriptions of subjects for whom the ""spit test"" was administered. Worth every penny spent and every minute read!"
3,"a nice concept, but...","One of the neat little features of the Palm m100 is that you can push a button, and the time shows up on the screen. The flip cover that comes with the m100 even has a little window so you can see the time display.The PalmGlove case tries to maintain this feature by putting a window in the front, and a little tab that, when pushed, hits the button to make the time display appear. however, the design is such that almost any pressure on the bottom of the front of the case activates the time display. if you have this in your purse or backpack or briefcase, you could waste a lot of battery power by accident.Other than this little battery-wasting feature, the case is pretty nice. So if you have a place to keep it where the button won't get pushed, this cover will work well."
5,Great Case,"I wasn't sure about getting a case for my M100 as I like its slim size. But, I know BodyGlove from my surfing days and thought a neopreme case may be trick, so I got one, and what a great decision. I shun away from leather cases as they are not as ""rugged"" as I want, but the Palm Glove is. Not only does it hold the PDA well but it also provides a little more protection in cae you drop it (which I have on several occassions). This case does a good job of absorbing the impact. Well worth the money, although I would recommend the all black version (which I have) as yellow seems like it would get dirty."
2,Didn't work for me,"I originally bought the Palm Glove case but didn't like it. I bought the Sumdex, which suits me better.The Palm Glove case was a teensy bit too small for my M125, so I was constantly stretching it and, finally, the stitching blew out. Also, because it didn't fit quite right, the cool little button to show the time was often misaligned.The second main issue was my fault -- I thought it had a belt loop but it doesn't. (I know, having a Palm organizer on one's belt is the hight of geekiness but that's the best place for it!)Also, I wish it had a little pocket to hold 2 AAA batteries (the Sumdex doesn't either. It would be a very useful feature.)If I kept my Palm in a briefcase or jacket pocket, the Palm Glove might be a better choice but if I kept it only those places, I probably wouldn't even use a case."
1,Piece of Junk,"Didn't work, and is a useless gadget. Turns out the airlines (at least in Business Class) will provide a loaner, so you really don't need it anyway."
5,Tim Hutchins Rocks,"Tim Hutchins exibits flawless technique and wonderful emotional interpretation of every piece on this album. This album has an interesting choice of repertoire and Tim interprets all equally well. As a classical flutist myself, I find his most amazing qualities to be evenness of technique and captivating tone. Also check him out playing Debussy's Afternoon of a Faun with the Montreal Symphony. He is an amazing performer."
2,The price gougers are still out in force.....,"This is a series of CDs (""Rock Breakout Years"" which sold for $5.98 at Best Buy. Notice the price being gouged, er....charged by these merchants and fulfilled by Amazon.Bottom Line: There are better collections of these songs for A LOT less money. Unless you're a completist, my advice is to pass."
1,Inacurate description,"I'm very interested in homelessness and I enjoy social theory, but this book is far more academic than the description made it seem. I couldn't get more than 20 pages into it without my head spinning. If you are looking for something light this book is not the right choice!"
3,Fisher Body,"I was actually disappointed by the book. What I remember when I entered years ago was the inspiring work that I saw in the contest booklet, a real inspiration to me. The books cover has a great shot, but so little photography in the book left me feeling teased and let down. Really too bad, especially for an illustrated history, as claimed on the cover.."
5,family history revisited,This is an excellent book on the whole Fisher body craftsmans guild history ...especially interesting if there is a historical family link to same such as in my case....
4,Magnificent urban angst,A thoroughly compelling first novel. Well drawn characters and a believable plotline with unexpected bends in the road. Like eavesdropping on the personal conversations of three busted denizens of New York City. Well done. Deserves to be widely read.
5,Larry McMurty is my Husbands fave author,"My husband loves westerns and so does my friends spouse so it is being read as we speak by lots of western fans, my Husband said it was VERY Good book!"
2,Oh what a Slaughter,"Contrary to the dust jacket this slight 160 page non-fiction book by well-known novelist Larry McMurtry (Lonesome Dove) is neither unique nor brilliant. It is a small rendering of six or seven Indian massacres, with little detail and even less historical context. Aside from allowing the author the opportunity to insert his own otherwise irrelevant political opinions on current events, for example, at one point comparing Plains Indians detained on reservations to ""Afghans imprisoned"" by President Bush (for terrorist activities) the book serves no real purpose for the reader. It doesn't really describe the topic in any real fashion. I concur with the reviewer who thought it seemed like a bunch of research notes pinned together and published as a book.In the final analysis one must ask the question ""what does this book add to the literature?"" The unfortunate answer is ""little to nothing"". The author should stick to writing novels. Libraries are filled with books that no one reads."
1,"White people-bad, Indians-good.","This didactic tome give the reader a typically one-sided, politically-corret view of the time period. His comparisons to modern day conflicts, especially Iraq, and emphasis on gore leads you to think the author is more interested in fomenting moral outrage than presenting accurate history. The cover photo of Custer on the Little Bighorn is misleading: to the casual, potential buyer it gives the impression of being a general history of westward expansion and conflict. After reading the contents though, you realize the Custer image is meant to be symbolic of America's thoughtless bloodlust and quest for power. If you're looking for objective history pass this one by."
2,Hastily Put Together,"This book is a mere 161 pages long, not counting the bibliography and index. The first 46 pages are devoted to an introduction of sorts before getting around to the first of the six massacres covered briefly in the book. That leaves barely over 100 illustrated pages to cover what the book is intended to cover. What is in the book is fine, but the author tried to bite off more than he could chew. The frontpiece of Custer getting his comeuppance at the Greasy Grass in interesting, but also a warning in that you can't judge a book by its cover."
4,Good Read,"This is my first experience with this author, I enjoyed the series. It is important to read the whole series of books."
1,Too Good to Be True,"I was so looking forward to getting my Ebookman. Ebook reader, datebook, to do list, address book, etc - all in one. I was ready to organize! But when I did get the ebookman home what a disappointment! It took me 2 hours to figure out how to get all the software loaded. What a headache that was! As for the applications, more frustration. The handwriting recognition software is much too sensitve, thus very difficult to use. Also, you can't input any of your data (for datebook, to do list, etc) in the desktop software forcing you to enter it directly into the device which is a huge waste of battery life or use Outlook which I don't have on my home computer. I sent mine back, and bought a regular organizer."
3,Nifty but not quite there,"The eBookman is a nifty little package with a slim profile but a large screen so graphics and text are easily readable. It has the basic features of a PDA (address, to do, memo), an easy to learn and reliable natural handwriting recognition system, plus additional features (the best of which is that it can play MP3s). In spite of this, its irritating to find out that, after loading in all its applications, there is barely enough memory to load in additional content (eBooks, MP3s, AudioBooks). No wonder its memory is expandable ... for the right price. Plus, it uses as a power source 2 AAA batteries which, as Ive found out, lasts less than two weeks before you have to replace them. Worse of all, if you're unlucky enough to not replace the empty batteries within 1 minute, you'll lose everything loaded in the eBookman including the OS. When this happens, its back to square one for you and you'll just have to reload the OS, applications and backup data from your PC."
4,love it,I absolutely love my ebookman. It is great as an organizer and I love the ability to download my favorite books. Very user friendly.
1,Please do not buy this product,"I am giving 1 star because there is not 0. The device requires you to install the OS EVERY TIME THE BATERIES ARE RUNNING LOW. The worst the batteries only last for a week, even if you are not using the eBookam. In addition, there is no way to charge the batteries without removing them from the EBookman. You will get more support if you talk to your plants than the support privided by Franklyn.You will do it better with a pen and a piece of paper."
1,"Great idea, poor execution","This product is a real disappointment. I received my EbookMan this past Friday and spent the weekend attempting to loan the operating system. It never worked as promised. The included installation materials were a joke, the instructions, such as they were, had to be written by a committee of 3 year olds. If you wanted complete documentation, you had to download 150+ pages. Not that it would have helped all that much. By Sunday afternoon, I decided that the EbookMan was not worth the hassle and will send it back to the retailer. Franklin should not have rushed this product out to the public before it was ready. Their reputation will be tarnished and the ebook segment will be hurt again by poor product."
1,Garbage,"Lousy product, claim they are going to get the Microsoft Reader for the product, but so far it has not shown up, still cannot download secured eBook files to the MMC card, the audio for the Music Player is lousy, even with headphones. Extreamly short battery life, under 2 weeks of normal use, everytime I replace the batteries, I loose everything and have to reload all the files from the computer. Basically it is a pile of junk and not worth the purchase price."
2,The One Book At A Time eBookMan!,"The eBookMan has a lot of promise, but potential buyers should be aware of some major problems. The screen is large, but the contrast between the text and the background makes it hard to read in anything but the best light. Controls are simple and battery life has been good, but the manual has to be downloaded along with the operating system and software. The worst problem is that after spending ... for an additional 64MB, I found that only music files can be saved to the MMC card! Since the OS, utilities and dictionary consume a majority of the built in 8Mb RAM, only 1 or 2 ebooks can be loaded at a time. Page 21 of the manual says you can store any files to the MMC, but Franklin had this to say: ""At the present time you are only able to load MP3 files onto the MMC card. You will be able to load other files onto the MMC card soon. Please check our Web site for future postings on this subject."" So for now, the eBookMan is actually only a very poor eMusicMan."
1,"Junk at all trades, sufficient at none","I bought this thing for two main purposes - to read e-books and use as an mp3 player. Forget the books - the poor quality screen and essentially non-existent backlight made the eBookman unusable for that purpose. As an mp3 device, it took an extremely long time to download the one song I tried; it played, but the ""speaker"" was a joke. I also tried unsucessfully to download Audible books to the Franklin; what a waste of time. Franklin should make a gadget to ONE thing well instead of everything poorly. One star is too high a rating."
1,This purchase a mistake,"Had trouble with this model from the time I took it out of the box. After loading the software from the CD, my PC crashed several times before I could finally get the software to load correctly. Then I couldn't connect to the Internet site to download the OS software needed to use the reader (why didn't they load this at the factory ??!!). Its now been two days and that site is still not available per Franklin's Tech Services who said ""just keep trying, we're working on it."" I hope so, 'cause this piece of junk is going back to the store tomorrow if I can't download the software."
3,Still Buggy After All This Time,"Well, the latest version of the ebookman operating system has arrived, v 1.08, and -- I still lose memory when I change batteries! This means you can't take the ebookman with you on a long weekend or vacation unless you also bring the PC you use to download new material. So far, Franklin's idea of technical support is to have a technician call me, sympathize, explain that the battery problem is in the operating system, and then offer no information when a new operating system will be available or when the problem will be fixed. What a pain!"
1,Avoid this one like the plague,"I was very disappointed in this device. I purchased one in Dec. 2001. Dispite claims to the contrary, you cannot change the batteries without wiping the system! This means you must then sync the e book with your PC and download everything again. Battery life is a miserable 7-10 days, even if you don't use the thing. It just sucks the life out of the batteries. The e book is basically unsusable for any serious application. The screen is not especially clear, and the PDA functions are pretty bad. You'd be better off with any palm or Win CE based device."
4,High volume fan,"This fan has reduced the temperature in my 5000 sq' X 20' high ceilings, production area, by 10 degrees, just by circulating the air. You can feel the air from it up to 25' away."
4,This Book is about French Beading! Not for Beginners,"For those of you who don't know what french beading is - it is the creation of flowers with wires and beads. Yes, that is a very simple description of a very complex process. I picked this book up expecting needleweaving - peyote, brick, loom, square - anything but what I found inside.I have not yet tried french beading but the project I found in this book would tempt me to try. The pictures are clear and in good color with good instructions. The wisteria worked with a root and displayed in a bonsai vase definitely has my attention.There is some jewelry with wire and beads done in right angle weave, crochet, and knitting.This book is NOT for beginners. It is for those who want to push the envelope of french beading to see where it leads. I just wish the author had chosen another title as I'm afraid this one will lead people to believe it leans to the needleweaving style of beadwork."
4,Nice!,I really like this book. There are full color pictures and it explains what you have to fairly well. I bought the book and that night I was making flowers :) Pretty cool. I really like the rose :)
5,Incredible,"I've owned this recorded for a number of years, and when I saw that it had not yet been reviewed on Amazon's MP3 service, I was outraged. This will make you ears bleed. From the very first bar of the very first track, you'll marvel at the intricately brutal programming from Atticus Ross. The only bad thing about this EP is that there will, in all likelihood, never be a successor - never mind a full album (it was a one-off studio project by the aforementioned Mr. Ross and what's-his-face from the Dillinger Escape Plan). Download this now. You will not be disappointed."
2,Possibly worth borrowing,"It's worth a borrow or a rental, but not worth purchasing. I made the mistake of doing so before I watched it. It's not entirely bad, but definately not an owner. It's starts off kind of ok with a nice Ferrari, making it look like they put some money into this film, but I think the Ferrari was the best thing about it. I just began to notice about a half hour into the film, that it's just really dry, and almost puts you to sleep. It has a bit of an 80's-type action movie feel, and the acting, in my opinion, is subpar. Like I said, worth borrowing, but I wouldn't waist money on it."
1,Run As Fast As You Can,"Run as fast as you can AWAY from this film! Maybe it's not the worst movie I've ever seen but I think it must be in the ""worst 10"" somewhere. You know, maybe there's some subtle, interesting plot that went over my head because THERE ARE NO SUBTITLES and I missed maybe 30% of the dialog but really, I couldn't care anyhow. Have you seen movies where people fall over BEFORE the gun even FIRES? OK what about CONSISTENTLY then?Yeah and the hero--we're supposed to believe he's some top secret agent, a 007 type. Actually he looks more like Kim Jong Il accidentaly stumbled onto a movie set. HEY WAIT--maybe this IS Kim Jong Il and the film was released posthumously? After all, he had a passion for movies...THIS may be the whole secret of the film! Really short, shrimpy guy with a terrible hairdo who looks like he couldn't fight his way out of a paper bag....Please, save yourself from this film! There are NO REDEEMING FEATURES."
5,Chaos of the Galaxy / Happy Man,"This is not a full review. I was reading these reviews and many of you wondered why the terrific song Happy Man was buried in static. I read somewhere that it's been rumored that Mark Linkous purposely ""sabotaged"" that track after learning that their record company wanted to make the song their next single. He did this because he didn't want to be too commercialized. The ""clean"" version (called the Memphis Version) of this song can be found on the EP ""Distorted Ghosts""."
5,Sparklehorse's Good Morning Spider: hear it and weep!,"It's hard to put in words just how beautiful and honest this record is. The previous 'Vivadixie...' album already was a 4-star recording, but Mark Linkous really hits it off here. The music varies too much to even begin explain. If you think good music is supposed to burn, stain and stun: Trust me, you won't regret this: Good Morning will be one of the discouveries of your lifetime. Sparklehorse is Tom Waits for the next millenium."
3,Hey Joe,"If you saw the movie ""the devil & Daniel Johnston"", its nice get a listen to the original ""Hey Joe"" by Johnston (not on the movie though), well done here by SparkleHorse..."
3,Three and a half stars for a cool record,"The care put into the recording of these tracks is evident from the beginning. The mostly double-tracked vocals on the quiet numbers really tickle your ears, while the burblings of the tape loops and synthesizers add just the right sense of unease to the sparse folk-rock settings. My problem is with the more middle-of-the-road rock numbers which really strike me as generic indie a la some Sebadoh. It seems to me that Sparklehorse is most adept at these quiet 4:00 a.m. type numbers--""Painbirds"" is a sublime track in this style. Not that the other styles are bad! They are perfectly good numbers I would have loved a few years ago. I'm just getting tired--not of indie rock, but of stuff that is, to coin a stupid term, indie rock a la mode, or rock that sounds indie. Uh...know what I mean?"
3,disappointing and overrated,"This music is ok. It's not startling, or highly textured, or even all that interesting. It's just there. Yes, I've listened to it a number of times. I just can't find anywhere to attach to it. Just a bunch of non-melodies laid over crunchy guitars. It's more like corn flakes than ""pure genius"" or whatever. Listen to it before you buy it. You may save yourself some disappointment."
5,A Gem you should own,"Many albums have 5-star ratings... too many, since excellence is rare by definition. Therefore, the only fair rating is six stars.< ...Like most great albums, GOOD MORNING SPIDER requires many listens before you realize its brilliance. I bought it on the strength of the reviews seen here... and because I liked ""Someday I Will Treat You Good"" (which I was lucky enough to hear on the radio)...this is a wonderful album. I rank it among the top-3 of the many hundreds of albums I've heard."
4,"Enjoy this DVD - not my fave, but my kids love it!","We go to the zoo a ton, so I thought this would be a fun one to add to our Signing Time library. I don't like the songs as well as some of the others we have, but my girls love it and seeing my 18 month old sign penguin while watching the penguins - priceless. We often put it on in the car on the way to the zoo."
5,Love the Zoo Train!,Highly recommend this to any animal loving toddlers! We enjoy learning the signs along with our son. Educational and entertaining!
1,fraud,"This make up is NOT a MAC product. This is like a knock off Louie bag, worse actually. I have used MAC for years and it was obvious upon first glance that this was not an authentic product. STOP IT!!!"
5,WWE Survivor Series,"WWE Survivor Series I Feel Is Going To Be A Great Game. It's Going To Have 8 Match Types Including One On One,Tag Team,Steel Cage,Royal Rumble,Handicap,Triple Threat,Fatal Four Way And Hardcore. It's Also Going To Have 16 Wrestlers On It's Roster Including Triple H,Shawn Michaels,John Cena,The Undertaker,Kane,Rob Van Dam,Chris Benoit,Chris Jericho,Rey Mysterio,Randy Orton,Kurt Angle,John Bradashaw Layfield And Three Hidden Wrestlers That You More Then Likely Have To Unlock In Its New And Improved Story Mode! Its Graphics And Gameplay Have Been Up-Graded Along With Tougher A.I. As Per The Request Of Some Fans. In My Opinion This Is Going To Be The Best GBA Wrestling Game Ever!"
2,This sucks,this game is not that fun I got bored of it fast don't waste your moneyPS road to wrestlemaina 18 is a 1000 times better
5,VERY NICELY BUILT:,"I bought these to replace similar spouts on bottles I use for hot sauce, olive oil and soy sauce. I suspect that the high acidity of my homemade hot sauce had caused the metal to rot on the original spouts. However, these replacement pourers work very well and seem to be holding up better than the originals that came with the bottles. I recommend them."
1,All the Magic is Lost,"I was absoulutly apalled with this book. I loved the Egypt Game and so I ordered this book. What a mistake that was. This book has no plot except Feel Sorry For Toby. The characters never actually play the game and all the mystery and suspense that was shown in The Egypt Game was lost. The whole book is loaded with sorrow for Toby, who runs away from his life and is generally sorry for himself. I personally found everthing in the Egypt Game much more exciting and interesting then The Gypsy Game. What is the point of calling it the Gypsy Game when they don't even play the game? There was no depth in this story and I did not care what happend to Toby because all he did was mope around. If you read the Egypt Game don't spoil the magic by reading this novel. The only thing bearable about this book is the great children's novel it is the sequel to."
2,Just not the same!,This was not a sequel to the egypt game it did not have any of the same story. they didn't even play a game. the book was good but should not have gone under the pretenses of being the sequel to the egypt game. snyder should have written this book on it's own identity and then i think it would have been better.
3,A disappointing sequel to THE EGYPT GAME.,"Long-time favorite Zilpha Keatley Snyder has finally written a sequel to her critical and popular success The Egypt Game, but she seems to have lost her interest in the characters and the subject. Instead, readers hoping for another interesting ""game"" mixing history and ceremony and fun will be disappointed by the lack of any real ""game"" here. Instead, a rather unbelievable mystery plot and a lot of depressed kids dominate the book. As Snyder's other recent books (Cat Running, for example) are lively and interesting, it was perhaps a mistake for her to decide to write a sequel at all."
3,"""EYGYPT"" was way better!","I thought that the Gypsy Game was pretty good, but I was very dissapointed that the kids didn't pretend they were Gypsies. I liked The Egypt Game a lot because it talked a lot about what the Egyptians did and how the kids played them, and I kinda wanted to play with them. In The Gypsy Game, the main focus was on Toby's dissapearance and what he did and how the other kids tried to find him and not about playing Gypsies at all! I think this would have been an eaqually as good as The Egypt Game if they had played Gypsies."
5,It IS good.,"From the point of a 12 year old this book was 1 point under the great book ""The Egypt Game."" It had the same great characters just a different plot from the previous story. They couldn't start playing because of a bunch of unexpected events. It was still really good and intriguing and I recommend this book to anyone who has read ""The EgyptGame."""
2,The Gypsy Game,"I was a little disappointed with this book after reading the ""Egypt Game"". It was whole lot less interesting because they did not give as many historical and imformative facts and cool information (Ie: Costumes, rituals etc..) there was too much information just on the characters and not on an exciting story."
4,My Students Love This Book,"I have read The Egypt Game with my students for three years now, and finally I had the time in the year to have them read this sequel. They were so excited when the books came in and we are having a great time comparing the two books. For the first time, my students are also looking forward to taking the book home and reading some chapters for homework! I highly recommend this book."
3,"You'll like it, up until the 3rd chapter.",The book gets interesting in the first and second chapter.I was hoping that the book would get better by the end.Toby is a very lame kid.He is a very lazy kid.But the rest of the cast is very energetic.
3,Mind bending atmosphere,"You get the feeling after just a few spins of DJ Spun's new mix that he rarely eyes the sunlight, content to spin his dub house in fog-filled clubs while playing the minds and feet of a crowd. Because one thing's for sure, SanFranSicko packs atmosphere, a muffled sense of claustrophobia even, and enough off-kilter acid to tickle your spine and fill the air.Not that the squiggle fiends run wild - note the disco shake sensibility of Astral Matrix vs ETI's ""Sublizard"" - but when the squelch spills over in ETI & the Waller St. Boys' ""city of the gods"" and Garth and ETI's choice acid rock take on ""20 minutes of disco glory"" the groove hits stride.Attribute that to smart track order and a DJ not interested in going all-out from the gate. Now if only he could have resisted the warped funk impulses at the end (Soulstice, Mephisto Odyssey) which play like an inadvertent wander into another party room. Still, a mind-bending mover for those willing to leap in the middle. Grade: B"
4,Bueno pero corto,"Solo dura 50 minutos y contiene 9 canciones, aun asi, es muy bueno.1. Medias Negras2. Rosa De Lima3. Magdalena4. Y sin embargo te quiero/ Y sin embargo5. Nos sobran los motivos6. 19 dias y 500 noches7. Conductores suicidas8. Ruido9. Noches de boda/ Y nos dieron las 10"
4,Wow,"Great performance! Sabina is one of the best poet-singers out there. His voice is going...although it has been going for the last 20 yrs...the band is great also. There are some errors made by Sabina/his band on a couple of songs which gives the impression that they did not rehearse this concert much...however, this is also their style. They project the feeling that they are just getting together to play music and what you see is truly what they are ""just"" putting together. I am not sure if that is intentional or not, but the result is just good music, amazing lyrics and a great time for the viewer."
3,By Blood Alone,"By Blood Alone was a good book, but it was a difficult read. The switching of the characters in every chapter leaves you lost for a couple of pages. The book has lots of detail, but there is more about politics than war, which the book is supposedly about. There are too many times when the same women are described over and over again. Such as Pardo walking into a room of politicians and the men stare at her for periods of time. The other significant part in the book refers to the ""Hoon"" and ""Thraki"", whom supposedly must fight each other, as told in prophecies. The book ends when the Thraki are sighted by the Hoon. Overall, it was a good book."
4,Military sci-fi at its best,I have been a big fan of Dietz for along time ( my first sci-fi was a Dietz) and this book did not dissapoint me. The Book takes place some years after the end of the the final battle and his about how the legion has gone bad from lack of activity. Its well balanced and is extremly fast to read and I cant wait for By force Alone to arrive. So if you are a Dietz fan then u should bau this book right now but if you have never read his other Legion books I would recomment that you read them first but it is not nessecery to enjoy this book cause it takes place 30 some years later
3,"Good, but strays too far from it's past","This, the third novel in the ""Legion"" series of books really trys to be too much. The first two had a solid foundation in military science fiction, and succeeded on that stance. This book seems to much of a setup to future books in the series, with the introduction of many characters whose only purpose is to set things up for later (and, in this book, later never comes). While Dietz is very good (one of the best in his genre, in my opinion) at writing a story, here he trys to take his story and make it an epic, and in that light the book does not succeed. I also would NOT recommend this book for those that have not read the previous two titles in the series. Too much of the backstory is left unsaid in this novel, and without that knowledge the average end reader will be lost."
4,Interesting extension of some older sf ideas,This is something of a bridge between the old sf and the new. Many of the concepts have been done before as well as the cast of characters. But this is done well enough that it keeps interest. The end also definitely leaves you ready to buy the next.
2,It Can Be Easily Shown? Duh!,"I mean no disrespect for the FATHER OF POLYMER CHEMISTRY, but its really hard to follow this book especially the equations......they just come out of nowhere..."
2,Not at all what I thought,"The two glowing five star reviews tricked me into thinking this would be worth the [money] I paid for it...I was wrong. Don't get me wrong, I love Bjork, I have all of her albums - but half of this album consists of the Alec Empire mixes, which is simply industrial noise with heavy beats and about one verse of the song crammed at the beginning. The other half are ... deconstructions of Joga and Bachelorette (Joga minus beats; Bachelorette minus piano and beat). While these seem quite nice at first, they're really nothing more than novelties. And the bonus eCD material doesn't even work on my computer (probably designed only for Japanese computers).It's not all bad though - the Joga Buzz mix is a delightfully positive twist on the original, and the packaging is nothing short of incredible, trading Homogenic's red and grey scheme for darker, moodier browns and greens..."
5,"Still going strong, 15 years later","I bought this thing in yellow forever ago and still use it every day, even with all the digital do-dads around the house. Simple, distinct, hearty, good looking without being flashy, goes anywhere (even though we typically run around with a bluetooth iPod + Jawbone Jambox these days)."
5,Stands up to abuse!,"I bought this for my husband about 1 1/2 years ago, and he is still thanking me! It bounces around either on the floor of his pickup truck or in the truck bed, and still works great. On the job, it is constantly subject to all kinds of dirt and dust, ranging from powder-fine sheetrock dust to wet, gritty mud, and is still performing without any problems. We agree that the A/C adapter block seems excessively big and can be a bit of a hassle to carry around, but it is a small price to pay for an otherwise fabulous boombox."
5,Exhaustively researched and wonderfully illustrated,"One of the frustrating things about researching early America is the lack of good graphic images. Aside from stiff formal portraits of the captains, there is little that can tell you visually what it might have been like to be part of the Lewis & Clark Expedition. That's where artists come in, of course. One of the best artists who is rendering images of Lewis & Clark today is Michael Haynes.It seems kind of funny to imagine guys running around the wilderness wearing those hats, but they really did! Tailor Made, Trail Worn is an exhaustively researched and wonderfully illustrated study of the clothing worn by the men of the Corps of Discovery. Every Lewis & Clark scholar is indebted to Moore and Haynes for this great book."
4,Better than X-MEN: GIFTED,"First off, I'm still so so on the Marvel Knights Series with its live-motion comic format. I enjoyed IRON MAN:Extemis but was pretty lukewarm to the previous X-MEN feature, GIFTED. This is an step-up from the first outing. What is surprising to me is that after so many years of X-MEN comics, TV shows, and movies, Joss Whedon has really come up with an original story and a new villain! And when we're done, we see Professor X in a different light, and a dark fore-shadowing of future events to unfold.Sorry for not being more detailed but I don't want to give away too much."
2,Worst Textbook ever,"This textbook is so terribly written. I'm currently using it in my honors biology class. The whole class is getting bad scores on the tests. It's written at a college level, and the authors expect that you have knowledge of every thing covered in the book. I don't understand why almost every 9th grade honors biology class uses this book. It made me lose all interest in Biology. I see kids crying in class when they get their test back, I sometimes cry as I try to study for this terrible excuse of a textbook. ALL the sentences are in a random order and have no correlation between them. You cant tell chapter 1 from chapter eight. Its all the same random words put together for ""gifted students"". If you can, don't ever get this book. If you are forced too, get ready for a long school year."
2,Not a great textbook,"My son had to purchase this book as it was required for school. It had some bad reviews on Amazon, but what can you do? He was required to have it. He tells me the reviewers were correct, this is a bad textbook and students should supplement their study with other Biology books, as we have. Don't buy this unless you have to!"
2,Agreed- confusing,"I agree that the book was confusing. I would not recommend it. Even with help from teachers, I did not fully grasp the information taught to me."
2,Too confusing,"I used this text for Honors Biology as a high school sophomore and the material was presented in a complicated fashion that makes it hard for a typical reader to understand. While I am generally a good student and can grasp new ideas quickly this text was complicated and in my opinion needs a lot of teacher aid in explaining, especially for first year biology."
1,I'm a freshman in Honors Biology and,"out teacher is sick and we have a permanent substitute. I find this book confusing and the teacher doesn't do a very well job at explaining it. There are plenty of facts and information, just too much at one time. I suggest making a photocopy of the pages you are reading and highlighting the facts to study..."
5,Republicans Lapel Pin,This Republican lapel pin is as cute as it can be. It large enough to be identifiable but not overwhelming.
4,Sturdy and fast!,"My daughter loves her new jeep! She is 4 and a half years old and has been having lots of fun with it. Overall, the jeep is made very well and has some good features. I assembled the entire jeep(including decals) in under one hour. Straight forward instructions and minimal tool needs, the only problem I had in this is one of the pre-drilled holes in the roll bar was a little too big, so the self-tapping screw wouldn't hold. I was able to purchase a larger screw to solve this problem. It definitely has power, there are two forward speeds and one reverse, they are easily operated with a gear-shift located at the base of the seat. The radio works well, the seatbelts are kind of a joke and the map and backpack don't say or sing anything, like they have in other applications. The turning radias is fair, the battery is easily accessable and there is enough room for a friend to sit in the passanger seat."
4,Great guitar for the price,"Great guitar. Did not have to replace the strings or anything. Did have to tighten the neck a bit, but a tool is included for that."
2,read it in wheap,when I recieved this toy I gave It to my kids right away. They tried it and hermini mumbled the whole time it was rediculous!
5,Kemani Cemal is King,Violinist (i.e. kemane- close enough for Turkey!) Kemani Cemal (pronounced 'je-mal') is probably one of the greatest living masters of Turkish music. Along with singer Berguzar and others he's recorded an album which is bound to be an enduring classic. The surface simplicity of this music hides its wheels-within-wheels churning of melody and rhythm. Only thing better than catching this album is catching Kemani Cemal live.
3,"Not perfect, but still the best choice.","First and foremost, I wanted something just about the size of the unit itself, and although I am not entirely satisfied with this product, it was my best choice: It protects the unit quite well and provides enough security such that I don't worry about damaging it while I'm carrying it around. Also, it fits tight to the unit, so it doesn't add much to the bulk. In my case however, it fits too tight: the windows don't line up quite right and the little ""glove"" button doesn't always work. I'm left-handed and I haven't experienced any problem grabbing the stylus as some may have, so that's a plus. In all, even with the few minor problems and having to carry around a ""Body Glove"" product, it still does its job admirably."
3,It Has Its Good and Bad Points...,"Since I had a gift certificate for Amazon.com, I decided on a whim to buy this case for my Palm m100. I was under the impression that it would be rugged and durable, yet slim and sleek. When I received the package and I saw it for the first time, my first thought was ""Wow, this is bulky!"" While not much was added to the width of the Palm, its thickness practically doubled. It seems to hold up well; I've dropped it with the Glove on and it works.PROS:- durable- waterproof- holds the Palm in place well- cover stays shut by being snapped in place- this snap helps protect the gaping hole for the HotSync cable- four buttons don't press while in your pocket as easily- good replacement for the flimsy m100 coverCONS:- bulky- adds weight- difficult to get stylus out- difficult to get the time by pressing the button- harder to get in and out of pocketOverall Impression: If you want durability, buy this, but if you don't need it, look elsewhere."
5,Best thing for your Palm 100 series!,"I just love this cover! It holds my m105 tightly, allows me to see the time on my screen, and is very attractive. My husband is currently looking for a similar case for his IIIxe. The neoprene (sp?) stretches and returns beautifully and does not put too much pressure on the PDA. I feel this is a great level of protection for my Palm as well, since it is a good shock absorber. I do wish it had a belt clip though, or that the company would release a belt clip attachment you could purchase for this item. Just the same, I recommend this Palm Body Glove if you are looking for an attractive, stylish way to carry and protect your Palm investment."
4,Best Palm m100 Case,"Great design. I'm really glad I chose this case over the other ones available. The quality of the product matches its price pretty well, and the case itself has been reliable. I like the extra pockets provided. However, I have found it difficult to keep both the cover that comes with the Palm and this one on at the same time, because the black cover tends to detach on its own accord! Also, the plastic ""harness"" that secures the case to the Palm reduces the aesthetic appeal of the Palm. Overall, I'd recommend getting this item, as long as size isn't a big issue. (The cover significantly thickens the Palm.) One more thing - if you are planning to get this color, avoid the Pacific Blue color faceplate: the two really don't match. I would suggest a Silver Mist faceplate."
5,The hottest of the Druuna books!,"This hard-cover book features nice sketches and illustrations by Serpieri, including very explicit hardcore paintings you've go to see to believe. If you love Druuna series, you must take one!"
3,Could be better.,"Alberty and Silbey contains the information needed in order to learn the material, however, the presentation is haphazard and many derivations/explanations are left out. I recommend reading the series of books written by Dan McQuarrie, or another supplement, then going back to alberty and silbey. The exercises at the end of the chapters are very useful, and I recommend getting the solutions manual for step-by-step explanations."
1,not a great pchem book,"Physical chemistry is a difficult subject to grasp. This book makes an attempt of understanding physical chemistry even more difficult than what it should be. I have used other professors texts, some over 40 years old, and they make far more sense in explaining the significance of various topics such as the derivation of the Schrodinger equation and its significance. The class that I am enrolled in requires this book, but I instead read another because of its almost impossible comprehension."
1,not the best book out there,I must disagree with the other reviewer. I do not think that the explanations are clear. The examples could be more illuminating. I have found that other undergrad texts do a better job at presenting the information and would recommend those over Alberty's any day.
2,Too advanced a treatment for undergrads,"While Alberty and Silbey is extremely well written, their discussion is overly advanced for an undergraduate Pchem course.... While the text provides a lot of good info, the writing style is very high-level and unmotivating, I often got very sleepy while reading the book (especially the chapterson quantum mechanics). A good text supplements the course lectures, and this one *certainly* did not. Also, check out their references sections at the end of each chapter...many of them are from *old* sources! Also, many of the graphs and diagrams in the book were prepared on old, rattletrap software packages. Well, no wonder, in the Preface they say that their book had been written over the last 83 years! Time to ditch this textbook and go for a fresher approach. Atkins' PChem textis better, I hear...maybe the revised version that cameout in 2000 is better. The one bit of kudos I can giveto this book is that there are some good end-of-chapterproblems."
1,where is the solution of this book?,"I'm a student of univ. from Korea. i want the solution of this book that's why i'm here. please, send me a mail about it.... please"
3,A text for past generations,"As far as I know, there is no good p-chem text around, especially for this generation of students. The various editions of this text has been around for 80 years and it had helped several generations of students to learn p-chem. Not anymore. Very few students of this generation can handle it unless he/she has a very solid math, physics, and chemistry background, can read books written in formal english, and is serious about his/her study. I personally know math majors who are about to graduate with good grades who even have hard time with simple algebra. In conclusion, this book is not very helpful to most today's students. The text by Atkins is a little easier to read. But I'm not sure if today's students will find it much better than this one."
4,Colonel Hunt is unvarnished,Colonel Hunt tells his experiences directly and his opinions even more so. We need more leaders in our military like he was when he served.
1,Corkscrew Canyon,"I'm reading these reviews, and everyone seems to think this ride is not reliable, because the riders are always getting stuck. Here's why. The reason why the riders get stuck is not in the track, it's in the rafts. Three steel balls are supposed to roll inside a raft, causing the riders to roll downhill. However, the rafts are getting stuck because the wheels stopped rolling. I took the raft apart to see what had happened and saw that the balls couldn't roll because there was too much friction between the raft and the steel balls (To take it apart there are three screws to unscrew in the bottom. I put some WD-40 on the balls and it worked just fine. This will fix the problem, but only for a very short time. Unlike most K'nex products, this model is not reliable. I recommend the Rippin Rocket Coaster 2, because I've had it for almost 3 months now and once it was built I haven't had to repair it!"
2,Clumsily made and easily worn out....worst knex model you can ever get...,"I advise anyone who likes knex to never considering buying the corkscrew canyon model. It is by all means, a piece of junk. The whole model is very clumsily constructed, and the tubes frequently fly off the track. They wear out very easily. It will not be long before the model doesn't function at all. Other problems are a total waste of space underneath it.This is the only knex model I've ever got that was a piece of junk, all of the other ones worked fine, including rides like the Dragon's Drop, Doubledare Dueling Coaster, basically any of the new or old models besides this one.Not reccomended..."
2,Canyon Disaster,"For all the K'nex we have bought, this one was a dissappointment. As others have stated, the overall design is clumsey and cheap looking. The chain mechanism works ok with assistance, and the sliders fall off or get stuck. Our son is very clever with these toys and he was confused by the instructions. Oh yeah...we had several missing pieces....maybe that's why!!I will say this though...we got ours for 50% off and that's the only consolation to buying this toy."
2,"Worked great, for the first day...","I purchased this item as a Christmas gift. On the day after Christmas, I helped my son assemble this product. It worked flawlessly for the first day. The next day, I turned it on to show the boys' grandmother. Apparently, the steel ball ""wheels"" under the ""riders"" don't roll very well after initial use. The riders would be hoisted to the top, but would fail to slide onto one of the chutes. If they did make it onto a chute, they would sometimes fail to glide all the way to the bottom, or would fall off the chute. The failure rate went from 0% when first used to about 90% after the first day. I've purchased other K'nex items before and never had a problem."
3,I was disappointed,"I bought this toy for my son after we got K'NEX SCREAMIN' SERPENT Roller Coaster.We were amazed with roller coaster (everything worked perfect)so we got Corkscrew Canyon. Although it has great instructions and looks amazing, guys riding the water slides keep falling or ending up upside down and the ride get stuck."
3,"O.K. ""toy""","Whoever these kids are that say it only took them 30 minutes to build obviously have either no concept of time or 5 other friends helping them build. Took me a good three hours and I was not slow in building it. Just like other KNEX toys once you build it you watch it--not much playing involved. Also I noticed that the tubers either would get stuck at the top or would turn upside down or flip off the sides so I suppose there is some involvement with it once it's built. I built this, the Pirate ship and the Sreamin' Serpent alll within the last few days. I'd rate this easier to build than the Pirate ship but takes more time."
3,Great Sound but Poor Manufacturing,"But they break easily! The plastic just above the earpiece shatters.I had a pair of these two years ago and I swore by them. The sound quality was great! They keep out most of the noise outside the headphones. And the bass comes through nicely. That first pair lasted me about a year before it broke. Which is fine. I don't expect anything to last more than one year. The plastic just above one of the ear pieces shattered.I recently ordered another pair. Only about a month ago. And they just broke. In the exact same place that the first pair broke. I was hoping that the first one was a fluke, but I guess it's just poor manufacturing istead."
1,Snapped after a month!,"It was a great month - these headphones have excellent sound and bass. I loved them. But they snapped in exactly the same place as the previous two reviewers had them snap, and mine only after a month! On closer examination, it is indeed a poorly designed pair of headphones - the plastic is extremely thin at precisely the place where the headphones experience the most pressure from pushing against your head.I thought perhaps I just had a big head, but after looking at these other reviews, it appears I'm not alone. Or we all have big heads.In any case, stay away from these headphones!"
5,Great teaching tool,"The format of the book is narrative stories, paired with suggested activities for each pagan holiday. I pull this book out as we approach each pagan holiday to reflect on how I can celebrate with my own son. I like that it is written in a way that children can enjoy the stories of their own accord, and adults can choose how much they want to expand on the themes in the stories, depending on the age of the child."
4,Inspired whacky humour,My 9 year old son enjoyed the surreal humour of the story of a young boy who engages in some weird and wonderful games with Captain Najork and his comical crew. My son was intrigued by the illustrations of the games and spent some time examining how they could work. It's short and funny; ideal for a 9 year old who is put off by dense text!
4,A great modern fairy tale,"After four children, our paperback copy of Captain Najork finally disintegrated. Tom's response to his Aunt Fidget's requirements, along with his determination to ""mess around"" with things that are truly important make for a hilarious and, at the same time, instructive read for children. Bring back Tom! Bring back the Captain! The overly programmed children of the 21st century will need them!"
4,A worthy collection of hits,"About half of the songs on this CD are essentials, in my opinion; which makes this collection a bit more worth the cost than many others I have seen and/or bought. The liner notes have some very good insight in there as well. Overall, if you need a collection for a history of early rock, this CD set is worth having as part of that collection, and certainly more worthy than many you find in stores."
3,Nee to be fix,"FOR ME THIS COLLECTION OF GOLDEN ERA OF ROCK N ROLL ERA IS NOT COMPLETE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY OF THE ELVIS PRESLEY HITS THAT REALLY CREATE THE ROCK REVOLUTION IN THAT ERA, THE AGENCY NEED TO CORRECT THIS RECORDINGS AND INCLUDE SOME OF THOSE HITS LIKE FOR SAMPLE[JAIL HOSE ROCK OR HOUND DOG]"
4,Old Time R&R,"Good music from the original artists. Many great songs, but done by the artist that first released them and sometimes not by the most popular rendition of the song."
5,Need to Read,"Before people make comments they need to read the book itself as did Carlos Palacios. The previous remark asks how someone who was not raised on the border write about border life. The author was raised on the border, in fact, Laredo, Texas is much much larger of a border city than the miniscule town of Rio Bravo where the previous commentor is from. Also the author was in a gang on the border as a teenager, served as a police officer on the border, and counseled gang members on the border after receiving his degree. So guys please read...or in the case of this man learn to read before making comments."
5,"Other Than The Hunley, Who Knew","What a fantastic book! Two of my favorite reading items compiled into one book. Well presented and when documented evidence does not exist the author presents plausible theories to allow the reader to make their own determination.Everyone knows about the Hunley, now find out the other part of the story to give you the entire story. I really just wanted to keep reading this book and ignore my other responsibilites, it is that good."
5,A book worth reading,"I have to admit I was somewhat skeptical about ""Last Suppers"" before I read it, just because...well, it is a book about inmates' last meals! But once I started reading it, I could not put it down until I had read it all. It is about meals, all right, but there is much more to this book than that. In a very unusual way, it deals with the controversy, created by a strictly American phenomena - the death penalty. And this makes ""Last Suppers"" quite an interesting reading both to Americans and people like me, who come from countries which have abolished the death penalty. The writing by Treadwell and Vernon, and the design of the book are very good. I strongly recommend reading ""Last Suppers"" - it is worth it."
4,Great machine,I've had Yamaha for about a month and I have no complaints. I use it for recording drums into my songs on PC and the only limitation would be my drumming skills.
5,Had it before and was worth buying again!,"I actually started playing drums about 7 years ago and this was one of the first kits I had. I used this for 1-2 years before I could afford an acoustic kit so had plenty of time to become accustomed to it. It was great to plug into the PA system or with some headphones for a more private and controlled sound. It is fully customizable; each pad can be altered to produce any built-in sound. If more on the conservative side, there are various kits that are already set up to blend together.For a beginner or someone with a low budget, this is perfect. Even now it's enjoyable to sit down at home, slip on the headphones and jam away, all the while in the middle of the den yet disturbing not a soul.I had the first one while I lived abroad and was too bulky to transport stateside again. You could say though it was so great I bought it twice!"
1,useless crap.,"Im all for getting a budget item to decide if you want to invest more in a better version. The only problem with this approch is when the budget version is so poor that it is actually useless. If judged solely by the quality of this device, the entier field of drumming is craptastic and uesless. The fact is, the two foot ""pedals"" are crappy buttons that fail to trigger most of the time and do nothing to simulate the feeling of a real drum pedal. Also, the pads often dobule trigger on a single hard hit, and randomly fail to trigger when you hit two pads at the same time.Junk. pass."
5,This is the best add-on for any handheld device,"This keyboard revolutionized my Palm usage. Before it was just an address book with a calendar. Now, I'm using it for everything! I wrote my senior thesis on it using Documents to Go. I take notes with it. Write emails with it. It's awesome. Sure, it's a little unstable, but how often are you someplace without a flat surface? Once it's packed up in its case, it's super strong. It can take a beating. All in all, buy it, you won't regret it."
5,Small - Nice price,This is a very good tool for any palm fan. It folds into a few sections making it about the same size as a regular palm. It is affordable - and small. Well worth the money.
2,"Cool idea, wish the keys worked","I have owned 2 of these now. They are an excellent idea, very slick and put together solidly. The only problem is I can't seem to get one that has all keys working on it. Good luck with the quality of yours if you plan on purchasing one, if mine worked, I would give it 6 stars. As I have had multiple problems with multiple keyboards, I say buyer beware."
2,Would be nice if the keys worked,"I don't know if the keyboard I bought had been used before (the packaging looked a little suspect) but when I used this product, it was always a guessing game as to which key would not be working - sometimes one or two sometimes 10 or 12. I really, really like the concept; I think that it increases the usability of the Palm 100% since you can keep it open on your desk and enter stuff very quickly. I hesitate to talk badly about anything Palm since I've had one for 5 years and don't go anywhere without it. Suffice to say that I was very disapointed."
2,Badly designed.,"I am baffled by the glowing review, below. The case exhibits the following deficiencies, any one of which would be enough to recommend against it:When the m100 is in the case, you cannot access the stylus, unless you have a third hand (one to hold the case, one to peel back the rear of the case, and one to extract the stylus. [This, of course, is a consequence of Palm's ill-considered decision to place the stylus at the rear of the unit. What were they thinking?]The m100 must be forced into the case with great effort.There is a thick plastic sheet (reminiscent of a spill-proof furniture slipcover) positioned over all of the buttons, interfering with the tactile feedback they provide.When the m100 is in the case, it is difficult to insert and remove the HotSync cable, as the case's seam partially occludes the slot.Avoid it."
4,small problem,"For the most part, I really like the style and functionality of the PalmGlove. However, the stitching on the top curve of the Glove started to unravel soon after I purchased it. The unraveling hasn't progressed too rapidly, so the Glove has been functional for a while now (though not very attractive).Seems like a problem with the quality of the stitching."
5,Excellent !,"nice product.. shipping was on time, and received it in perfect conditions.perfect companion for Palm m100"
5,Sure brings back a lot of memories...,I was surprised at how good the sound quality was on these recordings.It is definitely worth getting.
3,Has a design problem,"It is very easy to erase all files in a folder. If you accidentally or unknowingly hit ERASE twice, all files will erase.More added: After 23 months of use, it finally died. Warranty, of course, is no longer valid. I now have a useless piece of junk!! If I could, I would change review stars to NONE."
1,Stopped working,It worked great for a few months then experienced the same problem others have reported. It hangs once you press the record button and you must remove the batteries to recover. Would not buy an Olympus product ever again.
1,I loved it and then it died!,"I had the same experience as a previous reviewer - it worked great and did everything I wanted for almost two years, and then would no longer record. It saved my previous recordings, but I cannot get it to record anymore. I, too, will buy another brand."
4,Olympus VN-2000 64MB Digital Voice Recorder,"This product combines functionality with a sleek, compact design. Simple to operate, it has a sensitive microphone which produces great recordings. This recorder is excellent for people who don't need to use a recording medium like a microcassette."
3,Better performer than more expensive models.,I owned this model before a couple of years age and it eventually malfunctioned but the sensitivity of the microphone and the clairity of the speaker is exceptional.I was not satisfied with the more expensive replacement I bought. So I found & repurchased this model at Amazon since it was no longer carried it the superstores.
1,Disappointed,I was so excited to receive this but unfortunately it jammed within first 5 minutes of using it and couldn't fix it.
5,great but,great gun it is simi hard to sight in but it has a steady vlosity and arrcusity.if only i would have a little more time sience i was just barrowing it.
4,Amazing Rifle,"This is by far the coolest rifle I ever had, good weight, good looks, Tremendous power, excellent range, Nice feeling to it, comfortable price,very robust piece of hardware."
4,good for long sniping READ THIS,this gun is a very nice gun i racamend it to all airsofters i just couldint say its perfect because i couldnt find a way to srew in the rifle part and it is not that great up close amd the pull back is a little ruff but dount think of not buying it it is a wonderful gun if u need detals before buying call 218 235 8577
4,From Ryan C.,"When I bought this gun it worked well for the first year or so. Then after that it went downhill. I had to buy a new gen spring, which was a lot of money. But after that it worked great. It has a high FPS for battles in fields and arenas and a VERY high FPS for backyard skirmishes. But overall, the gun was a great buy and you should get the sniper. So my final words of advice: get the one with a 5th gen bolt. It will help you in the long run."
1,Used 10 times and the Inner Mechanism Broke!,"Nice gun, solid, but it should be for the price. Shoots well. The gun jammed after 10 shots and the strap is crap, it WILL break on you. The 'metal' loop holding the strap material is so thin, it broke as soon as I put it on my back. Who makes a $150 rifle and puts a 20 cent strap on it!??? Amazon will return the gun, but will not send a good strap.... of course. And who actually manufactures this gun? Update: after using the gun on and off maybe 10 times now, the inner firing mechanism broke so the gun is now worthless. Cannot find a replacement. Dont buy it."
2,not bad,"This rifle is not bad , could use some work.The rifle does shoot pritty good with good BBs .Finish is not to sturdy .I had to drill out the barrel to get at the hop up.Again needs some work."
2,pretty bad,this airsoft sniper was pretty good out of box but its been a day now and i fired it and it no longer has half the accuracy it had the day before
5,Simply Amazing,"This rifle is the embodiment of what I imagine a sniper to be like. The bb's go amazingly fast and make it easy to hit moving targets. Recommended bb weight is .25, .2's float up after a football field or so."
1,unsatisfied customer,"When ordering the rifle I made the mistake of thinking what was being shown on the example pictures is what I was going to receive. I was wrong the pictures are very misleading. It should state somewhere that the scope shown in every picture is sold separately. Also when I was assembling the rifle the two screws that attach the barrel and stock were not included in the box. This was supposed to be a Christmas gift that turned into a frustrating experience, so overall I was unsatisfied with this purchase."
4,Good,"The UTG(Leapers) Shadow Ops l96 is a fantastic sniper rifle.Even though it's a clone of the Warrior l96, It outstrips the AGM, Well, and TSD Tactical versions, beaten only by the Mauruzen and Warrior versions. It is easy to hit a chest sized target at 150 feet, and easy to hit a can at 50. It comes lubricated, but the bolt needs to be lubricated often. It is extremely durable, and I have fallen on it countless times in skirmishes, as we play in an area with steep topography."
5,very awsome gun!,the gun and everything in it was just epic! but...they failed to send me 1 5mm Allen wrench. but i was like oh well ill just use my own tools >:D i would buy it again if i could. the only draw back on this item is the shipping...waited a month but so worth it!
5,If you got the money...,"Awesome gun, alittle expensive, but its worth it. Crazy accurate if you use heavy ammo (.30). Really strong, hurts reaaaaal bad. really durable and well built, the only complaint i have is that the bolt has to be cleaned and greased up every once in awhile, which is work that im not used to. I buy spring guns because there ussualy very simple and low maitnence. but still this guns pros severly outweigh its one or two cons"
2,"Great airsoft gun, while it lasts","It was a good gun, high power, not too hard to cock, nice and quiet. Adjustable hop up. Came with a bipod and scope mount, which I used. Good accuracy. The metal holding the strap was too thin and broke in cold weather.After several battles, the plastic trigger box broke inside, and I can't fix it. I'm 13 and it's hard to save up that much money for something unreliable."
2,Great Gun,the worst compony iv ever had too deal with they cancled my order two times then finaly got it rite. but i love the gun
1,look elsewhere,"please look at mauser instead of utg. i have had good experiences with mauser but not with utg. all my utgs have broken after little use, and not because of me being careless either."
4,utg shadow ops,First of all i love the gun! shots great and accurately! although i was expecting a little more range for the price of the gun. Also it is super heavily! when i get done playing for 3 hours my arms are so sore! and the clips on the strap will come off easily and that is always a pain. the gun does not work very well in a close envorments! Its a lot better in a open area where you have good line of sight. The bi pod is nice! when you get sick of holding the gun you can lay down and deploy it. allowing you to make good accurate shots. you must have a speed reloader. it is a pain to reload the 25bb clips by hand! but fortuntly it comes with one! all in all i love the gun and it will still shot over a hundred feet! I gave it a four star because of the weight
3,OK but Not Great,"Plastic is a bit cheap compared to others that I have including other UTG's. Rail for bi-pod clicks in place and is very wobbly. Could be by design.Hop up adjustment requires allen wrench and is located in a difficult to see/access area. You can by no means adjust while in the heat of battle.That said, very accurate indeed. Very precise. Clip base made of metal with spring loaded plastic top. Metal barrel and trigger assembly very rugged.If not for the wobbly parts, cheap plastic and satanically placed hop up it would easily be 4-5 stars."
5,great gun,this is by far my favorite airsoft gun i have ever have the pleasure of shooting something with great gun is awesome and the gun has great power and decent accuracy
2,Not a cappuccino I'd buy...,"I love spiruteins shake mixes, but I always get chocolate or vanilla ...thought I would try something different. It did blend easily and was smooth and filling, but it does not have a coffee taste...even after adding chocolate to the shake it tasted more like blended cardboard ...maybe I got a bad batch, but I am not trying again..They have too many good flavors to waste my money on a blah one!"
2,A Sea of White Impatiens was better,"I wanted to like this book because I really enjoyed A Sea of White Impatiens. Having grown up in the same town as the Gallaghers, I enjoyed all the references to the people from ""Roweneck"". The main character (or the author's voice) came across as ignorant sometimes and I was getting tired of the arrogant tone. It had an interesting beginning and an intriging middle, but the ending fell flat. The wrap-up was a bit outlandish and conveniently neat, like a Hollywood movie. Perhaps, that is the author's intent."
5,Easy to understand,This book is really good book. The content is easy to understand. I borrowed this book from the library at the begining and I found it so good that I decided buy one myself.
3,Yeah not so good,"I'm not a picky guy, really. My reviews are generally straight to the point and I'm PRETTY easy to please. After reading the reviews for this, I held my breath and ordered. The piece came EXTREMELY well packed and was not broken. HOWEVER...it was more than 1/2 inch off on one length and about 3/4 on the other. For where I was going to put it, that makes a big difference. Also, after I opened the outer carton and cut the tape on the 4 sides of the inner styrofoam carton, I lifted the top off and there as a razor blade sitting on top. I was pretty shocked and ticked off. Am I going to return it? No. It IS a great solid piece, just know that if you're looking for a pastry board in a SPECIFIC size for a SPECIFIC need, you may not get it. And BE CAREFUL in unpacking!"
5,cooking,This item was much thicker and heavier than I expected. It is perfect for rolling out pastries. It is easily cleaned by running a wide kitchen scrapper blade across it.
3,A Packaging Gamble,"I'm not sure if the these slabs are forwarded to us directly without inspection by this seller on Amazon, but I did receive mine with a small chip on one of the sides. Obviously the chipping occurred before packaging since the missing chunk was not included in the adequate packaging which pretty much seals the board. It doesn't seem like a good idea to use knives on this surface and it makes me cringe when I read about people doing so. It's a *pastry* board. People also need to beware that it's (a) very heavy and (b) slippery when wet. If you have critters and/or children underfoot, take extra care when handling this slab. If you're accident prone buy some steel-toed shoes."
3,"Great item, but foot rest fell off.",This is a great item and was packed extremely well. However after I had gotten it unpacked and sat it on the table the rubber foot rest came off. I ended up glueing it back on except now the pastry board wobbles some. Still an excellent product for the price and quality.
1,broken marble,"This probable would have been a nice piece of marble for my nephew to do chocolates on. Unfortuneately, it was delivered broken in half. You shouldn't buy anything that weighs 25 lbs."
1,Don't waist your money,"Don't waist your money on this. I received my order yesterday and knew instantly that the board was broken because I could hear it rattling around in the box. I opened the box and yes the board was broken because is didn't have enough padding to ship such a heavy & fragil item. Now, I have deal with the hastle of returning this, I""m out the money for the board and shipping and don't have the pastry board that I needed this weekend. What a shame."
1,Came Broken in Two,"It arrived ahead of schedule in what seemed like formidable packaging, with plenty of padding and ""fragile"" stickers. Alas, when I opened it, it was broken completely into two pieces. Bummer.Update: Company quickly contacted me to offer replacement or refund."
1,Broken!!,"After all the reviews about this board arriving broken, I thought surely they figured out a way to fix the process of sending it. No, they didn't. There was a large chunk broken off on off the corners and I was so sad as this is a beautiful board. No problem, return it right? Well, there were no return labels in the box and I don't have a printer at home so now what?"
2,Arrived damaged,"I received a marble board that had a big chip on one corner. I searched the packaging and there were no pieces of chipped marble so I am guessing that is was damaged before it was sent to me. It is not bad enough that I would go through the hassle of returning this very heavy and cumbersome item but I am disappointed. I'll have to be careful not to bang that corner on anything and make the chip bigger.As others have pointed out, the corners are not rounded like the example shown when you purchase it.I bought this to help with rolling out dough, so it will do but certainly not happy about the chip. If I had bought it at a local store, I'd try to exchange it.I'll post a photo of the damage.Also, the outer box wasn't taped shut very well and it was basically open (one flap taped shut, one open) when I got it. It was clear that it was not tampering, just not enough tape for such a heavy box."
3,"Nice product, poor packaging","I wanted a marble board for my cookies and thought this one would be the ideal size and weight. The board came very quickly, but was packaged in a very large box. There was only some brown paper around the styrofoam inner box and the inner box was sliding around. When I opened the package I found that one corner had broken completely off. Needless to say, I had to return the board. I must say that the return went very smoothly. I'm sorry the board was broken because it really was nice. I am reluctant to order another one from this seller because I think it will be packaged in the same shoddy way. So I'm still looking for a marble board."
5,Super for pie crust!,I bought this for my father who comes from a long line of yummy pie makers. Mine arrived in one piece. My mom bought one too and hers arrived in three pieces They accepted the return and refunded her money. I think they could improve their packaging to prevent breakage. The product is great though and at a great price so this bargain hunter thinks its worth the risk. BOTTOM LINE- This stone is cold and ready to roll.
2,NOT A GOOD WORK SURFACE,"I was so excited when I bought this board...I consider myself to be a careful person and take good care of my belongings. This board has chipped, stained and the shiny finish it came with disappeared shortly after I put it on my kitchen counter. I clean it every night when I'm doing the dishes and cannot get the shine to come back. We've never cut on it or placed hot items on it, but it's stained and nothing I've used to get the shine back has worked."
2,Never received,"The company that this was ordered from never sent it. I'm not sure I have received a refund or not on the bill. When I ordered, the ad said there was only one remaining, and I guess that was true before I ordered mine.I feel this company should have kept a closer eye on their clearance products, and removed it from the sale list."
3,Perpetual Change,"This is not a bad book. Yes fans will find lots of information on every version of Yes. But like the Chris Welch book, it sometimes feels like it was pasted together from old magazine articles.I still prefer Dan Hedges' old biography of the band. The writing is better. It has a sense of humor (humour?) and a point of view. It isn't always a flattering portrait. Rick Wakeman apparently hates the book. But it makes Yes comes across as an interesting collection of humans, rather than airbrushed ""gods."" That's why it was interesting to read.If you can't find an old copy of the Hedges book, this one is a good second best."
3,Close. . . but not to the edge,"I'm not a Yes appreciator who either knows nor cares whether ""Fragile"" was released on a Tuesday morning or a Wednesday afternoon. But if you inhabit the obsessive-compulsive end of the Yes fan spectrum, this book is for you.It's a reasonably good source of early Yes history -- even if most of the information was well-covered in the Welch book from a few years earlier, and in the Hedges book from the late 70s (out of print but also worth tracking down).Stylistically, Watkinson's book is written with an ""I've bought every t-shirt the band ever issued"" brand of blind enthusiasm that cynical readers might find grating. But novice or terminally hardcore Yes fans will eat it up with no problem.The only crude note is the negative, mean-spirited introduction written by keyboard player Rick Wakeman. It's so bad it's almost funny. The band, their fans, and this otherwise positive book deserve much better."
1,Yesterday's Children,"This dook is based on actual events of Jenny Cockrell's life from childhood to the present. Reincarnation is something we have always been taught to not believe in. This book doesn't preach reincarnation, that is left to the reader to draw their own conclusions as to what has happened but is does bring to light there is more to our lives and our beliefs than we realize. I know people who have had strange dreams or feelings of things they just can't explain, this book may shed some light on these. Makes on wonder if someone else's spirit can speak through someone living or is there other explanations. Can the movement of time cause some to see into the past or the future? This book will make you think."
2,Not my favorite,"The glass is very thin and the gold line is not the best color. Black would have been better. I bought all three sizes and wasunhappy with the quality. Alas, buy and learn."
4,Good first album,"Just as Ritchie Blackmore replaced the guitar player of Elf with himself and became Blackmores Rainbow. Paul kossoff replaces the guitar player from the band Bloontz, and renames the band Back Street Crawler. What a great move, I have the Bloontz LP and it was actually a good album, but with Kossoff playing the guitar, the band stepped up to Elite status. This is a really good album and Paul shows off his stuff with musicians other than the Free guys. If U like Blues U'll like this one."
4,Singled Out,"For nearly three years, we've been waiting for a new Moby CD and ""We Are All Made of Stars"" is a great start-off single. Even though it's misleading as to the content of the full-length album ""18"", it's still a good song. It's backed by two b-sides on this Pt. 1 import, the first being the superior one. ""Landing"" featuring vocals by Azure Ray is so much better than the competing b-side ""Soul to Love"". I'd even go so far as to say that it's better than the Azure Ray track Moby put on ""18"", entitled ""Great Escape"". It's a must-own b-side! As for ""Soul to Love"", it's got a potential, but the mix-mash of vocal samples doesn't help it very much. Get it for ""Stars"" and ""Landing"" and witness the return of America's top DJ!"
3,Not for ATI graphics cards,"I enjoyed the first Desperados game, so I picked the sequel up looking for more of the same. However, Desperados 2 is strictly designed for use with Nvidia based PCs. The graphics are too corrupt on ATI based machines. Just a warning."
1,it can not be installed on win7,"sucks, i download it from amazon, but it can not be installed on win7, some kind of incorrect file name! screw amazon"
1,crappy game,Overly complicated scenarios. I bought the game thinking it was a shooting game but it is mostly sneaking around trying to figure out secrets.
5,Another printing and a third edition is on its way.,"The amazon.com site states that Nutritional Biochemistry is ""out of print."" Fear not! According to the editors at Academic Press in San Diego, another printing is on its way. Furthermore, the editors are interested in publishing a third edition of this textbook. The third edition will probably have more than one author."
1,PURE TRASH,HYE KIM SU IS A GREAT ACTRESS AND I AM SURPRISED THAT SHE WOULD TAKE SUCH A ROLE AS THIS. IF YOU SEE HER IN ( DID WE REALLY LOVE) WITH BAE YONG JOON YOU WOULD SEE WHAT A GOOD ACTRESS SHE IS . THIS IS WHY I BOUGHT THIS DVD BECAUSE OF HER. BUT I HAVE WASTED MY MONEY . PURE TRASH I SAY.
3,Ramsey not at his best,"The book started out fine and I was just waiting for what I knew Campbell would provide: suspenseful, creative, and interesting reading. Unfortunately, it comes in very small doses. The plot moves slowly and has too much dull reading. The book ends leaving me a little confused as to what happened. I finally found out on the 2nd to last page how Allison was able to get Queenie out of Rowan's body. But even the explanation left me a little confused. I believe Campbell spends too much time on describing surroundings and not enough time on connecting with the reader on character thoughts, intent and beliefs--once again my opinion. I still enjoy his writing style and will seek out more of his novels. Some of his books I've read have been very very enjoyable. This is just not one of his better works."
4,Feel the Influence of Ramsey Campbell,Ramsey Campbell shows once again that he is an undisputed master of horror. He takes the things that go bump in the night and throughs it in your face. A great modern ghost story that will tingle the spine a send a chill deep to the core.
2,Failed Broadway musical revived 25 years later.,"This is a true oddity. HER FIRST ROMAN with book, music and lyrics by Ervin Drake is a show with some promise. The rhyming in some of the lyrics is clever, the premise of adapting Shaw's CAESAR AND CLEOPATRA to the musical stage a beguiling one. But this is amateurish from beginning to end. Not able to make up its mind whether it is drama, comedy or low comedy, it is none of these. Uggams is woefully miscast but Kiley does a wonderful job as Caesar. There are only two songs of merit - MANY YOUNG MEN FROM NOW (which should be in every gay cabaret singer's repertoire) and the rollicking I FELL IN WITH EVIL COMPANIONS. The rest range from mediocre to downright boring. Amazing that the original cast members and the producers liked it well enough to mount a cast album 25 years after the closing. Valuable to Broadway composers/lyricists in showing how NOT to write a show. This would have been ideal material for Lerner and Loewe, but sadly not for Mr. Drake."
3,Lower than expectations,"This book came highly recommended by a math teacher. I have not had a chance to implement anything, but as of yet it seems a little wishy washy. I have found a couple of good tidbits, but I certainly enjoyed ""The Reluctant Disciplinarian"" more."
5,Amazing Concepts of Discipline,"Teaching with Love and Logic addresses the need for logical, self-confidence building discipline procedures within a school. It suggests proactive techniques for affecting a positive learning climate for students and teachers. Through logical consequences and caring actions, schools can help develop citizens who monitor their own behaviors."
2,Useful Book,I found the first few chapters of this book very useful for my teaching practice but I never finished it. The truth is it started to get too indirect with the illustrations - the paedagogical links were not clear. And generally the book slowed up as it progressed from easy reading to something else.
4,Love and logic works-for sometimes,"Like all educational theories this book is another way for teachers to do classroom management. It does and can work, but it can be a bit harsh toward some students if followed exactly. I would recommend reading it but with an eye toward integrating the ideas that seem ""logical"" to you and your individual classroom situation."
2,Fine for the masses.,I found this a little more idealistic than practical. I've not found this useful for those kids who like to ignore the logic. Some middle school kids just aren't motivated by doing better or getting good grades. This can work for the kids who are motivated by the adult praise and attention.
5,Concerning: Not What It Seems,"Did this person read the book? Love and Logic shows empathy and gives children choices to learn how to become a productive member of society. They may have said in the earlier writting about a swat never dammaged a kid for life. However, it also talks about what corporal punnishments teaches in the long run. Like hitting teaches hitting. Love and logic is the way to discipline without hitting. As a parent and teacher this works in the classroom and at home. The only fault I can find in it is that I may resort to old tactics in the moment and sometimes it is hard to think of logical consequences at the time of the offence."
4,Teaching With Love and Logic,This is a good teaching resource as most of what it says is true.I apply much of what it says in my classroom.
4,great,"great informative book, anyone entering the teaching world or a parent this will change the way you think and approach you children"
2,Not what it seems,"This book sounds good at first. However, if you read more closely and critically, you will notice that the writers are encouraging manipulation.I read the parenting version and was horrified. They recommend putting your pet to sleep if a child forgets to feed it, taking meals away from children, corporal punishment and an ice cold approach to talking with kids.Great short term results with dire long term consequences for parents, teachers and children."
3,Useful but overwhelming,"Teaching with Love and Logic offers many wonderful tips to create a positive learning environment. However, the text is rather lengthy and tends to repeat itself. The length and organization of the text make it rather difficult to comprehend and absorb. Perhaps, reorganizing the text to be more succinct would make it easier to ""put into action."""
3,Intuitive and Condescending,"Teaching with Love and Logic is a good book for the right kind of situation. This may be good for a teacher who comes off as too harsh on her students, or one who tends to become engaged in power struggles with students. For the most part, Love and Logic comes intuitively. For example, carefully wording responses as in the ""Turn Words Into Gold"" section. For example instead of saying ""You show respect,"" a teacher might say ""I'll speak to you when you speak to me with respect."" However, I find it to be very condescending, and so do my students. They often think I am being sarcastic when I am saying some of the catchphrases from the program, like ""how sad."" My students even think it's funny to tell each other what I am going to say in response to the behavior before I do. We are required to use it at my school and I really feel like implementing it in its entirety really is not good. I do use some good parts of the program."
4,Great way to discipline,This book is wonderful! There are so many good ideas and thoughts shared about how to interact with the children. I have used the method combined with others found lots of success. Good luck reading!
4,Value for money,"There's lots of information here for not too many dollars. KISS Guide to Sailing is a much bigger, heavier book than you'd expect from a simple sailing primer and it offers a lot more information than I thought it would. Along with the usual dinghy stuff the book covers a whole range of topics that make it pertinent to the moderately experienced harbour sailor as well as the beginner. I've been sailing small keelboats single-handed on Sydney Harbour for about 15 years and it was KISS that finally encouraged me to haul my spinnaker out for the first time. If you're a first timer or need a refresher course, this book is well worth the money."
2,"Dense, bad writing","Perhaps the best part of this book is that it has really good problem sets at the end of each chapter. Unfortunately that's where they the good ends. The writing is dense and hard to understand, as if the author is unable to articulate his thoughts cogently and concisely and hides it with vague words. There is a lot of information crammed on one page and the diagrams are not explained well. If you are a researcher it is important to articulate your ideas clearly so that your work is understood. I think schools that use this do it mainly out of tradition rather than the actual quality of the book. As for me I am off to search for better books to supplement this one."
1,Search Elsewhere,"I had to use this book for my intro phonology class at Harvard, and i have never been led so astray by a textbook in my entire life. Even my professor apologized for it's horrible quality on numerous occasions. It's a shame that there aren't more textbooks on the subject available, because if there were, they would certainly be preferable to this catastrophe of a piece of academic writing."
5,Its cute and he loves it,My son loves it I find it adorable and by accident on the same day i got this in the mail my mother came home with a matching poster. My son will not sleep in his bed if this pillowcase is not on a pillow.
3,Good product with one flaw,This case is very nice but it has one flaw. The stylus is difficult to remove while the palm is in the case.
4,Nice fit - Nice Case (No Stylus Problem),"I recently got my case and have to agree with the issues on the front velcro. You have to put a little effort into getting it closed and staying closed.Other than that, I love it. Fits on my belt nicely, lets me connect the hotsync cable and access the buttons, makes my palm m100 easy to carry.As for the stylus problem... the sides of the enclosure into which you slip the palm are elastic cloth, This allows you to slip the stylus into the side of the case if you want. Then you can access it rather easily. The elastic is open at the bottom, meaning there's a possibility of losing the stylus, but I haven't lost mine yet.As for the bulk it adds... Any case will add some bulk. I'm a 6' tall male with good size hands, so the bulk doesn't affect my ability to hold the unit easily and use my m100. Generally, I like it, but the weak design of the front velcro does keep the case from scoring 5 stars in my book."
3,needs better cover attachment,The tiny bit of velcro that they use to keep the cover closed wears out quickly.
3,Beauty is only skin deep,"The case fit my Palm 130 very nicely, but IT DOESN'T FIT IN THE HOTSYNC CRADLE. There's an opening for the HotSync connection, but the lip on the case is too thick and the connection can't be made. So much for leaving the Palm in the case to HotSync."
4,Mostly Satisfied,"PROS: High-quality materials (with decent finishing (stitching, etc.))/Multi-use flip-top/belt holster design can suit most use styles/Offers good protection with a minimum of bulk/weight/Pocket in cover for credit/business cards/Pretty damned stylishCONS: Poor ease of access to stylus/Weak Velcro patch on flip-top cover/Needs clear plastic window/thumb stud over scroll button to view clock"
3,It's not wonderful,"This case is not wonderful, but it is much better than the case that comes with the m100. The stylus is hard to remove unless you come at it from the right side, and my Palm doesn't fit just great in the case. It is also quite bulky in this case."
3,"NOT ENOUGH VELCRO, YET EXUDES ELEGANCE","This case is quite elegant; however, the velcro that holds the frontal flip is not enough to hold it completely. Also, the stylus is a bit cumbersome to remove, but it's bearable. All in all, the ability to use your M100 without taking it out is a sure winner...Cheers!"
3,Not that useful,"The case is nice, soft leather and all, but has some problems when you use it: To reach pen from your Palm is not easy. Leather case covers thightly your Palm, and also the pen that is in the back. You have little room to pick it with your fingers. When you have Palm attached to your belt, you have the dilemma: Should I wrap the velcro that attach the case to the belt (with velcro noise and problems to untie it)? or Should I remove my Palm from the case (not that easy because, as I said before, case is very thight to your Palm)? I'm sure is a good thing to carry your Palm everywhere (and not only when you are using a shirt with a pocket), because with this case you can carry it on your belt, but it has the problems I show before. Also, the case add volume to your Palm, which became bulkier and it doesn't look as portable as Palm itself."
4,Cool item!!!,I love this item that I got. I just want to warn you that you can not put it in the cradle. It will not go in. It is to big. I don't care. Order off the seller performancepda it came to my doorstep in 4 days.
3,I expected more from a high end watch,"I purchased this watch directly from a Movado store in April 2007. It is now November of 2007 and I have had to bring it back twice. The first time the screws in the band kept coming loose. My husband kept fixing them, to no avail. The second time I had a problem, the battery died. I paid $1,300 for it and certainly expected more! And, the worst part is that no one can work on them except Movado!I have a Timex that I wear to do yard work. I got that one 3 years ago for 20 bucks at Walmart and never had a problem!"
2,Frustrated,"I bought this book before looking at the reviews. I am trying to make the Playful Overalls. I have only started and have noticed that the numbers are wrong. The directions are not very good and I have had to sit and figure out what is what. For a simple project that should only take about 2 days, I think it is going to take me at least a week. If you are an experienced crocheter and are comfortable in tweaking patterns to your needs then I say go ahead and get this book. However if you are a beginner you might want to skip and get something else."
2,"Nice idea, bad execution.","I have to agree with other unhappy reviewers; the patterns in this book are very poorly written. They may be ""simple"" in style, but good grief the directions! I have been crocheting for over 20 years and even I was confused. I feel sorry for any new crocheters trying to follow these directions! I have made the Heirloom blanket several times & just finished the Dusty Rose Sweater (see customer images) & while I like many of the objects in the book, I would not suggest that you buy it. Honestly, who edited this book? There are other books out there which have both beautiful objects AND good directions. If I could suggest a similar book which is well written, it would be ""Adorable Crochet for Babies and Toddlers: 22 Projects to Make for Babies from Birth to Two Years"". Bottom line: Save yourself the headache & buy something else. This one is not worth your money."
1,USELESS!!!!!! Not even for intermediate!!!!,I hate this BOOK i regretted that I bought it!!! although I wanted it so much because of the projects.. but IT'S USELESS and I got so frustrated with the patterns!!!! they're so so so useless!!! and WRONG!!!! I swear I was following it and corrected it I end up doing my own pattern instead of their directions!!!if you are thinking of buying it .. DON'T!!!!
3,Who thought these directions were a good idea?,"Before buying this book you should check it out at the library to make sure you can disipher the horribly written directions. It really is a shame because the designs are GORGEOUS, but the patterns are practically useless. I'm still trying to figure out how the author turns at the end of a foundation chain.I agree the patterns could not have been tested and the editor really dropped the ball. There is an entire section of direction left out in the beginning where the basic crochet instructions are.Very disapointing."
1,"Very Cute Projects, Very Bad Directions",I have been crocheting for over 30 years and I had trouble from the very beginning of the first project I attempted. The directions are very confusing and there seem to be numerous mistakes as to the number of stitches. I am going to try to muddle through to make some of these items for my very first grandchild because the clothes are definitely cute. I would not recommend this book.
2,Poorly written patterns,"It seems that no one ""road tested"" these patterns before publishing. Though the items are cute, the patterns are not as clear as they could be. Mathematically, the number of stitches from one row to the next don't make sense a lot of the time. I've had to rework patterns in order to get them to work correctly.If you're new to the craft, I do not recommend this book. If you're experienced and don't mind having to fudge patterns, go ahead. But honestly, trying to make things from this book was a frustrating experience."
1,DO NOT BUY !!!,"I have crocheted for over 35 years, and have done every type of crochet possible, and NEVER ever had more than a tiny problem with directions. This book is a nightmare of non-information and incorrect directions. I can't believe it was sent out to the public like this. And now, from reading other reviews, newer crocheters worry that it is their inexperience that caused their frustrations. This was the biggest waste of money I have done in ages. I never even expected to NOT be able to understand it, since it IS suupposed to be SIMPLE CROCHET. Even if it were advanced crochet, it is a mess. I wish I could stop every single person who is reaching out for this book to PUT IT BACK. If you ARE more advanced, then you can figure out a lot of the pictures for yourself, and save your energy and......money. Terrible, Terrible.....TERRIBLE !!Sincerely,Deborah MayOregon"
2,Huge mistakes in patterns are very disappointing!,"As most other reviewers have mentioned, this book has by far the cutest pictures and items for babies - I picked it up because it was the only one with patterns that I would actually make! Imagine my disappointment and discouragement when I start making a very simple and very small item - the little booty with foldover top - and the pattern so obviously does not work! Anyone making this little sock would realize immediately that the 14 rows in the ankle part are only enough to go halfway around the sock opening! Could someone have made this pattern with real yarn before publishing this book?!?? If I have to rip out all my stitches and redo the fit, I might as well throw the entire pattern away and write my own book. I have been crocheting for about 4 years, but I could certainly write a better pattern than this!"
1,Mistakes in the Patterns,"I was really excited when I got this book because many baby patterns in other books are pretty ugly and shapeless. This one has *adorable* pictures and very, very cute designs. There are mistakes in the patterns, however. I often found myself having to scrap the written pattern, look at the pictures, and make things up as I went along to try and approximate. This is not why I bought a pattern book! If I had wanted to make up my own patterns, I'd do so. When I buy a book, I expect to be able to follow it. I also expect the author and publisher to have tested the patterns for errors or confusing parts. I don't believe that was done here, which is pretty disappointing."
1,Waste of money,"I bought this kit, followed the directions, and got an inconclusive test. Lines are supposed to appear to indicate whether lead contamination is present. No lines at all appeared. The instructions say if no lines appear ""the test did not run properly and the result is not valid"" it may as well also say thank for the $10, sucker. Don't buy this."
2,One measly test strip,"I was disappointed to find that the kit only provides a single test strip. Would it increase the cost that much to include several, so I could test several different water sources?"
2,Eh,Not particularly impressed with this product. The first kit I bought didn't work correctly. There has to be something out there that is more effective and that is reliable. Ideally something cost effective that can be used multiple times.
5,Easy to Install,"If you make sure to first read over your computer manual for instructions on how to open the case and install new memory -- as well as look over the drawings of what it looks like inside there -- it will take less than two minutes from start to finish.Just open up the tower, locate the correct slot, insert, make sure it's solidly in place, replace the tower and turn on the computer again.You will immediately see a major improvement in your computer's performance and speed."
4,To Add...,Windows (prior to XP) and motherboards (prior to P4) can only handle a maximum of 512mb of Ram. With a rambus board you can have up 2gb in a newer system.
5,'Odysseus in America',"'Odysseus in America' is an excellent reading of war, in Odysseus's time and ours, in its analysis and insights into combat trauma and the trials that follow as veterans make their way home and attempt to reintegrate themselves into civilian society. The writing is superb, the insights are wonderfully apt, the research puts author Jonathan Shay in the top-scholar class. The same applies to his 'Achilles in Vietnam'."
1,BE CAREFUL!,Do not buy this product from seller Altawie. I am very disappointed with the quality of the product i received. it's not an original MAC product. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER.
5,Brill the best,I worked for Bill Brill for 15 years. Not only is he the ranking authority on Duke history; he's the guy I ask when I want to know what's happening with the program right now. He's my kind of writer; he's informative and readable.
1,Incorrect Picture is Unacceptable,"I just got this product in the mail today. I haven't used it yet, but it looks fine and hopefully there's nothing wrong with it.My problem is that the picture of the item displayed on the Amazon page is clearly incorrect. This is simply unacceptable. No, it's not the end of the world, but the customer has little information to go on when purchasing online. And when the little information they do have is incorrect, it destroys the client's trust."
3,it works for what I needed,This is a very nice lightbox. Did it have to cost this much? It seems so simple.
4,Search for Southern Italian Roots - A Good Read,"Dances with Luigi is a great novel for those who wish to trace their roots of from lineage of Southern Italian or Sicilian family heritage. The author's writing style is closer to that of a TV reporter then to the writings of an author. hIs character depiction of Luigi is strong. HIs adventures searching for his grandfather's roots form Rome to out -of-the way villages in Southern Italy take interesting twists and turns, especially when addressing concurrent themes of Mussollini and WWII. Some of the mini-stories hit the mark when family ties make sense, while other unrelated moments make the reader think that the novel could have been written with a lot less information. At any rate, the novel is intriguing for Italian-Americans to read."
5,For all the geneologists,"Most of my favorite books are Life Experience books. This is a very entertaining story of one man's journey into his family's past. Try the book, join the adventure. You won't be sorry."
4,Pleasant but not deep,If you read this book you will get an impression of Southern italian and Abruzzi lifeand Italian immigration to the USA. It's well written and the few details and the people are interesting. But this book does not convey a depth of emotion or information. It would be better to read Barbara Grizzuitti Harrison or Gay Talese to get an an in depth feeling and appreciation of Italian-American discovery of the reality of their Italian roots as well as much more detailed and researched descriptions of Itlaian life.
3,Good Resource,"This a good resource for people who are choosing not to use medication to help manage AD/HD. The book give a basic idea of what AD/HD is. It offers suggestions for natural ways to help with AD/HD such as changes in diet, toxin removal, biofeedback. etc. The suggestions in the book may also pertain to ADDults."
5,great book. must get,"this book has a lot of great information, including diet ideas. and i'm positive this will help my child. and i'm sure it would help your child, even if they dont have add, its a great guide to help with every day living for children and parents"
5,A unique and real romance,"As a devoted romance reader, I grow tired of reading characters who are too-too perfect from page one. Perfect house, perfect family, perfect life, perfect everything...WHITE KNIGHT was so incredibly wonderful because it started out with a hero, Christian, who was tough and flawed and hard-edged in the beginning, a result of the the life he'd been born into, but who changed over the course of the story, because of the unselfish love of his heroine, Grace, living up to the title of ""White Knight"". This story demonstrated beautifully how love can truly change a person's life and it dealt with some real-life issues that a good many romance writers unfortunately shy away from. I commend Ms. Reding on a job well done!"
5,Very nice watch that is easy to read and a nice accessory.,"This watch is not dainty but still feminine and dressy. I love the bracelet for this watch, I have not seen one like it before."
4,An intersting start to the series,"David Gemmell introduces readers to Druss the Legend in Legend, Book 1 of the Drenai Tales.In an interesting departure from the way that these types of book series usually go, Legend picks up with Druss as an old, old man. He is a legendary warrior and the veteran of dozens of campaigns. His exploits are known throughout the realm and he is getting ready for one last battle.Gemmell's writing is very tight and the characters are all fully realized and utilized. His dialogue flows throughout the story and he does a good job fitting the words to the various characters. His battle scenes are among the best I've ever read.While not high fantasy, it still provides a good romp through a land of swords with just a touch of magic in it. I enjoyed it and I think you will too."
3,Good,"I read this book - enjoyed it, but not one I would have with me on a deserted island. I will keep trying this author, he does have his moments."
5,The original fantasy masterpiece!,"Even after all these years, what is most amazing is that this was Gemmell's first novel. It was and still is one of his best. If you've never read it, do so right now!"
1,Written by a 5 year old.,"This book is bad. After reading well developed stories written by Robert Jordan (1st 5 books), Stephen Lawhead, Sharon Kay Penman and Orson Scott Card, it is impossible to accept this forced story. After reading the first two chapters I threw this book down disgusted by the shallow characters and weak plot. It felt like Gemmell was trying to force me to accept his characters and how they relate to each other. There is very little chemistry. If you want a copy of this book you can have mine that I left at the Sheraton in Denver, plugging up the toilet."
4,"Fast, Furious, Addictive!","At last! A book that captured my attention and held it through every single page. This review is like the book - short & sweet.Not a deep book, but deep enough with a few subplots to keep ya guessin'. Who will survive? Who is the next Legend? Just how doomed are they? Who is the traitor? What is his/her motivation? Is the bad guy really all that bad? What fun!It's the desperation and determination of the doomed characters that immediately earned my respect, and that' exactly what happens to the characters IN the book!It is a fast paced paced read with excellent battle descriptions. I've been looking for a book like this for the last several years amidst all the epic 26 volume sagas! I lost several hours sleep; I could not put it down!Read and enjoy!"
5,Outstanding...Incredible...Absolutely Without Par!!!!!!,"David Gemmell is one of the finest authors that I have everread. The entire Drenai saga, as well as the Stones of Power.His books reach down deep inside of you and ""connect"" you withthe heroes. You feel their trials and tribulations as yourown. With their victories, your spirit soars. And as a heromakes the ultimate sacrifice, you can only stare on inwonder, realizing that you have witnessed the rise, fall, andredemption of a true hero. If this hasn't sold you on thisbook, then you are a hopeless soul, floating bereft in a seaof chaos. BUY THE BOOK!!!"
2,I wanted to like this...,"I couldn't finish this novel. The author is a decent author in many ways. The atmosphere was well captured, he initially created a likable and intriguing character, and the general setting could have been engaging.However, the dialogue and action quickly devolved into the cliche and melodramatic. When the first 'bad guys' are introduced, their few paragraphs are hamfisted, and again, cliche. When our craven hero decides to face down 20 armed men led by a supposedly ruthless and unbelievably cruel killer, their conversation sounds like something that would fit into an early 1800s romance. I couldn't make myself read any more. Not to be insulting to those that did enjoy this novel, but this is more a book I would've enjoyed when I was in middle school or earlier, only to read later and be disappointed."
5,Legend...a lesson in humanity,"I first read Legend in 1987, and have read it about once a year since. Legend is a fast-paced tale of heroes and villains. It reads like a pulp western novel, but with philosophical undertones. Gemmel writes believable characters and locations, transporting you to exoctic locales with incredible comrades. Once you've read Gemmel, nothing else in the field of fantasy fiction will do."
5,'Legendary',I loved this book from the first time I picked it up at 16 - to now (some years later). For pure enjoyment you could do no better than Gemmell.
2,Recommended by another; quite a disappointment,"Disappointing; writing started good in the prologue but contemporary dialogue brought it down some; not enough happening; mediocre to poor characters at best; two antagonists fell in love too soon; not believable; too much introspection on the part of the main character for about 45 pages; too much exposition; too much said that wouldn't have been said by people who lived in that time! And, worse, it was explained in dialogue. Check out how George Martin does it!)"
2,A very clunky effort,"This was a difficult book to read. The author had a tendancy to switch between scenes. No space, no line, no star. While this may work for Thomas Pynchon, it just made this book unpleasant to read. Besides this, the characters were a bit flat. I didn't like Druss much at all. I pictured him the entire time as a dwarf. The first half of the book I did not enjoy the plot much at all. Near the second half of the book the author hit his stride and reading was easy and fun. That's why I gave it two stars instead of one.The end was predictable. Well, predictable except for the way the author pulled solutions for everyone's problems out of his posterior. The stuff at the end just felt like the author lost momentum and made up a way to tie off all the plot lines. Very unsatisfying. I know I won't continue this series."
2,Much worse than I had expected.,"From the reviews, I did'nt expect great literature or convoluted plot lines from this book. But the reviews are soooo good, I had to give it a chance. After about 200 pages I just cant seem to finish it. Its that bad. Going back to the book is like pulling teeth. I cant decide whether to finish it or not...its that bad. In fact I started another book just to give me a break. If you like really one dimensional characters and stories where He-men settle all their differences with an axe or sword fight(that are not exciting or well written), then this is the book for you. I just Dont understand all the glowing reviews!"
1,Boring,"Quite a few writers have developed the epic theme of the ""good but unlikely"" versus the ""evil and powerful"" with dynamic and compelling worlds and characters. Within a few pages, Legend seemed to me to plod over the same territory without the promise of adding much that was fresh and engrossing. I usually give an author a good chance to get going, but regretfully could not force myself to go on."
2,40% failure rate,"I have bought many brands of DVD-R in the past 7 years and these are by far the worst. 2 out of 5 fail. I would recommend TDK brand instead, which also provide more writeable space on the disk itself (the HPs are red, with a lot of graphics on them)."
1,Verbatim is better,I bought a pack of Verbatim disks and they all burned just fine. Then I burned all the same content to the HP disks and for some reason it takes them a lot longer to que up in my dvd burner and about 1 out of 12 are bat disks. I did not have any bad disks with verbatim.
4,They Do the Job,"These are readily available from most Office stores for about $20/100 on sale, and I have burned perhaps 200 of them over the past 2 years. I rarely get a ""Coaster"" - I burn them at 8x in a 16x HP-sourced DVD Burner Drive. Nero shows these to be CMC MAG AM3 disks, a typical OEM supplier. I have little long term history with these, but find that they work well so far and the price is right."
1,disappointing,"i like to back up my dvd's. i was using memorex, no problem 'til i ran out. having no special alligiance to any brand & having used hp cd-r's successfully, i tried these. well, it played on my computer but not my dvd player. i will be replacing these."
2,cheaply made,"I thought this was going to be a wonderful gift for my husband for christmas; however, when it finally came in the mail (3 1/2 weeks later) I was shocked to discover the sweatshirt was about as thick as a regular t-shirt. Normally a new sweatshirt is soft and fluffy from all of the cotton...not the case with this. Don't get me wrong the graphics on it are nice, it is just cheaply made. I just wish it would have been made with higher quality materials =("
1,never received the book from International Book,"I'd love to tell you all about the book, but I got a book about the Gospel according to starbucks, I tried contacting International Books but never got a reply, so STOP buying from them...you're never sure what you'll receive...so I bought another one today from Amazon...as soon as I get that one. I'll tell you all about it.STOP BUYING FROM INTERNATIONAL BOOKS...unless you like random books"
1,aint nothin like the real thing,"These guys are a perfect example of why neo-swing was such a flash in the pan. They're all style--a style they borrowed from Royal Crown Review--and no substance. There was a time a couple years ago when you could grab any bunch of dorks out of the band practice room of the local junior college music department, throw a zoot suit on 'em and get a gig at the hippest clubs on the west coast, but those days are gone, thank gawd. One listen to this disc will tell you that, like virtually all the neo-swingers, these guys have never listened to the real stuff, but merely borrowed their sound and gangster noir imagery lock, stock and barrel from Royal Crown Review. Sadly, they don't come close to measuring up to RCR, especially in terms of the rhythm section and vocals. Blue Plate Special are a great example of how a potentially great idea--updating vintage swing--turned into a worthless fad."
4,Lots of action.....,"Meredith Fletcher follows up DOUBLE CROSS with twin Elle Petrenko's story. Elle and her twin sister, Samantha St. John, were separated as babies when their parents were killed. Sam grew up as a US citizen while Elle remained in Russia; both became spies. Sam is trying to unravel the mystery behind the death of Athena Academy founder, Marion Gracelyn, and recruits Elle's help. However, the chase leads them on separate paths and Elle is forced to re-examine their parents' deaths. With the aid of soon-to-be former mobster, Joachim Reiter, Elle will discover the reason behind her parents' murder and meet the man who did it. Meredith Fletcher does an excellent job at intertwining the stories of Elle and Sam across multiple countries. This was an enjoyable read but could be confusing to readers new to the Athena Force series."
4,Old software a bit of a drag,"I just got this product this weekend, and it does work great with my IIIxe - plenty of speed, even with AvantGo. But, I have a beef - the CD I received contains MultiMail Pro 2.26, which works fine BUT the current version of MultiMail Pro is 3.1 with many more features. Palm says I have to pay for a full version if I want MultiMail Pro 3.1, at $40! Since I just paid my $100, I felt a little miffed at this shortcoming, especially since Palm now owns Actual Software. Customer support was a bit clueless about this, and seemed surprised I would even ask..."
4,Truth in advertising: a lot of songs from Bing's films,"If you are a fan of the music of Bing Crosby, particularly of the music he made in his movies, then you will definitely enjoy this CD. On this disc are several of his most well known songs from such films as ""Going my Way,"" ""The Bells of St. Mary's,"" and ""Dixie."" He also sings such popular standards as ""O what a beautiful mornin'"" from ""Oklahoma,"" and ""On the Atchison Topeka and the Santa Fe."" Once again, if you enjoy the music of Bing Crosby films, as well as some of the great American standards, then you will enjoy this CD."
4,Hello... These are Stylus's. Any Questions.,"OK, so these are the Palm m100 Stylus's. If you own the m100 I recomend you get some now. If you are anything like me they fall into the abyss (your couch, under the car seat, whatever) and are never seen again. The price is right, they are original (from Palm), and they work great."
5,Gotta have at least 1 spare stylus,"When I first got my Palm m100, I don't know how many times I couldn't find my stylus when I needed it. It's nice to carry an extra one with you. Before I got these, I've had to use a crochet needle, mechanical pencil and a toothpick. Just get these and save yourself the hassle."
3,Creative License,"Based on the true story, a lot of creative license was utilized in this this semi-fictionalized and semi-non-fiction version of the Leo Frank case."
5,EVEN IF ADULTS SAY,"NIGHTMARES DON'T MEAN ANYTHING...Nightmares are horrendous...chilling, so real...I know grownups don't say it to us children, but they are scared too when they have nightmares..I got rid of my fear with this wonderful book. So, I am reccomending it FOR GROWUNPS"
4,Thought provoking!!,"I have just completed reading Carol's book. It is truly a fascinating subject. One I have always believed in. I am amazed at how readily children are able to recall their past lives. I only wish adults could do the same, perhaps many unanswered questions could be cleared if we were able to remember a past life time. The author does an outstanding job at captivating you from the first chapter. This is a must read if you are interested in the subject of reincarnation."
4,slow to start but worth your time.,"i started out reading sylvia browne books when i was looking for information on reincarnation. i was so absorbed by her that i didnt realize OTHER people wrote about past lives too! this was one of the first books i read that explored someone else's thoughts and research.it took me a little longer to read as usual. the book starts out kinda slow and i started wondering what i got myself into. when i got to the middle and then the end, i had a completely differet outlook. it was very worth the tedious begining. and as a bonus, i dog-eared all the pages that mentioned other books about reincarnation and it now serves as a reading list. quite a nice one so far, the books its mentioned that ive read have been amazing. :)"
5,a well researched piece,"Carol's book is a welcome addition to PL literature.She details the fascinating area of Past Life recollections by young children. What I especially like is that her journey began with spontaneous phenomena in her own children.Carol writes in a very readable and informal style. Much of the other material on children's past lives is written in a very dense, formal academic style so I found her book readable and refreshing.I would strongly recommend this book.Thomas G. Shafer M.D.Associate editor, Journal of the Academy of Past Life Regression Therapy"
2,I felt very taken with the book for the first few chapters.,"Believing in reincarnation myself I was very taken with it at first, but after a few chapters I got a little bored. She was talking too much about her life and less about the lives of other children."
2,Waste of Money!,"I expected this book to be more informative and a little less boring. Carol Bowman has a reputation for trying to smear the reputations of other New Age authors and discredit their work. I thought this must be due to the fact that her own work is brilliant--I was wrong. Now I realize that all of her boasting was just a clever sales pitch. If you're looking for something that deals with reincarnation in more depth, this is not the book for you."
1,BORING,"This is the most boring book I've ever read about reincarnation. Carol Bowman spends two thirds of the book talking about herself, and then she uses the same cases of reincarnation in children as examples over and over. If you think this is a book that has lots of cases of reincarnation in children and the effects in their lives, don't waste your money, that's not the case."
1,Total disappointment,"I have read a great many books on past life regression. They either give many cases, or discuss one case in great depth. This book does neither. There are a few short examples of her children being regressed and being helped with problems. Without any other content to write about, the rest of the book focuses on the fact that she decided to write the book! She repeatedly points out that while there are many books about past life regression with people, there was nothing written about PLR with children. Pardon my ignorance, but I thought that children were also people.I agree that a well-written book on PLR with children would be quite interesting. Unfortunately, this book does not make the grade."
1,nonsense,My son Phill is so much like my mother that it can be spookyat times. My Mother is still alive in poor health with the mindof a two year old. Could it be that my Two year old son changedsouls with My mon? I dont think so. As a writter of fictionmany thoughts cross my mind every day. To beleave in all of themis foolish. This book is foolish.
3,She has a website too,I got a lot out of reading her website. People write in about real experiences with their own children. Interesting.
5,The wisdom to let children lead,"Carol Bowman has written the kind of easy to read book on children's reincarnational memories I wish could have been available when my parents were baffled by my own babblings and behavior as a child! I regret now that I don't have a record of what I said and did in my early years, but she is teaching us how to understand, guide, and keep records for our children now, and in the future. This is one area where we should trust children to give us a better understanding of reincarnation, and she is to be commended for recognizing, and making it her life's work, to let the children lead."
1,Don't buy this book!,"This book is not worth your money! There is nothing new, and that which appears to be new is totally unsupported by any kind of historical research. In addition, the dust jacket claims that this is the first full scale biography of RFK. That is if you don't count Arthur Schlesinger's RFK and His Times."
1,terrible,"I read this book and immediately wanted to return it. The author spends way too much time talking about alleged affairs that Bobby and Jack may have had, and very little time with anything else. It is all too apparent that this book is much to do with smut writing and nothing of substance."
1,CAVEAT EMPTOR,"It is ashame that it isn't a crime to defame the dead,because if it were, Heymann would be in jail for many years.Most of chapters in the book are taken verbatim from his earlier work on Jackie Kennedy.I think a better title for the book should have been R.F.K. Tabloid Stories.This is not the Bobby Kennedy I Knew and Loved."
2,Editorial,"I question the author's motives and sources. Heymann interviewed Roy Cohn (RFK's nemesis) and the son of Jimmy Hoffa. The author gives his opinion of Peter Lawford's acting, and includes here say and rumors as if it is fact. Despite the most unflattering depiction of Bobby, Heymann does a great job of highlighting Kennedy's passion and honesty."
2,The Dream Continues,"So, this is how one sells books today. Bobby needed to have two or three lives to get involved with all the endeavors (sexual and otherwise) that the author shoves at the reader. Although a very interesting read, this book can be summed up in three words - gossip, gossip, gossip. Look at the public man and what he did and what he stood for - THE DREAM STILL LIVES ON."
1,Absurd hatchet job,"I picked this up for $2 used. I paid too much. This book is an offensive hatchet job, full of ridiculous claims that the author makes no attempt to substantiate. People simply make claims about RFK, and Heymann prints them. I know Bobby was no saint, and I don't expect hagiography. But this biography goes way too far in the other direction. One source compares Bobby to Caligula. At that point, I stopped reading the book. Save your money -- even if it is just $2."
1,The author disappoints with unsubstantiated gossip.,"Although he was no saint, Robert Kennedy did have a reputation for being a devout Roman Catholic and good family man. It is sad that the author chooses to sully this good man's honor with such a worthless book. If RFK were alive today the author would undoubtedly be hiding behind a locked door somewhere ( Shades of William Manchester!) This book would be better characterized as very bad, poorly written fiction. It is a commentary upon the times we live in that silly, undocumented innuendo provided by people with suspect motives can be put together in a book and published simply because it takes down another American hero who isn't here to defend himself. These are indeed the worst of times. RFK, looking down from Heaven, can only shake his head and ask: Why?"
1,And your point is?! RFK's sex life should be made public?,"I can't believe Heymann would even dare to write as intensive as he did in the aspect of Bobby Kennedy's private life. Does he want our perception of him to change? Regardless if all these supposedly acts are factual, for those who truly believed in Bobby's work, will remember, respect and admire him for the hope and justice he gave the country. The timing of the release of this book just goes to show that journalists have this disgusting desire to point out public servants personal lives. Can't we embrace the memory of Bobby Kennedy without trying to tarnish it?"
2,"This is a footnote haven, and second hand stories of RFK.","The book showed some more insite of the real kennedy power. It also shows that Bobby was the brains behind his brothers Presidentcy. It also shows many, many, times there infidelitys of the Kennedy men. And the footnotes were unreal.It also shows there seamy side of politics This book gets 2 stars."
3,Too vulgar,"I appreciate the attempt at honesty that the author makes. The Kennedy's were immoral, and I object to any attempt to make them appear otherwise. However, honesty does not require vulgarity. The author quotes verbatim from many sources without editing their vulgarity. I also wonder at the motives of some of the sources; although the author does not seem too worried about that. I wish that he would have told the story in his own words without the sensationalistic erotic language."
1,Disgraceful,"This is tabloid trash! Anyone who reads it to better understand RFK will be sorely disappointed because all this book does is regurgitate a lot of rumors,lies, and innuendos.This is drivel posing as scholarship and Heymann should be ashamed of himself. Take a huge miss."
1,Gossip,"When I bought this book, I couldn't wait to read it, but once I started, it took me months to get through the whole thing, because I just got so annoyed at the author that i couldn't read more than a few pages without getting fed up. I love Bobby Kennedy, so I'm a little biased, but a book full of ""It was widely belived that ..."" and ""Many people assumed ..."" is not a biography, it's just gossip. RFK was not perfect, but this book paints him as a cold, heartless individual who doesn't care about anybody but himself. It fixates on his shortcomings and says almost nothing of his numerous good qualities. If you've never read anything about RFK before and you plan on reading this book, go for it, but take it with a grain of salt."
1,I Am Terribly Disappointed.......,My husband bought me this book as a Christmas gift thinking that I would surely love it as I loved Bob Kennedy and his ideas...I am glad he will never know just what he bought..he died before I read it.I would like to trash it but since it was one of the last gifts he bought me I will just put it in a quiet place with a note to my children to never dirty their hands to read it.
1,"don't bother, find another biography",I really regret picking this book up at the library. I am in the market for a more accurate depiction of RFK.
1,"Trashy, tawdry character assassination","This work seems to pay inglorious homage to a number of souls who held such dislike for RFK that, years after the fact of his horrible, untimely [end of life], they couldn't wait to spew sordid ""detail"" about the man in the hope of damaging his legacy. He cared about his family, he cared about the less fortunate, he cared about the powerless. He personnified those convictions. No politician on either side of the spectrum has ever succeeded in achieving what he did for a few crazy months in the craziest year of the latter half of the 20th century. We're a poorer society and culture because we were deprived of RFK far too early. Mr. Heyman should be ashamed of himself for writing this."
4,Great Movie,"Although the movie was long, I couldn't tear myself away - not even to eat dinner! Mark Harmon was very believable in the lead role. The story was intriguing, but sad. If this were a book, it would be ""a real page turner""."
2,not great,"for texas, it is not that great. The enchanted rock guide is all but worthless. Reportedly inaccurate in other areas as well. For an enchanted rock guide, check out erockonline.com"
3,A bit tight!,"The replacement batteries work put are not the best copy as they fit a bit tight. On the other hand, they work and were a good price. Time will tell."
3,"Nice book, avoidable mistakes","This is a nice book, although a little dated. But I still would love to have this on my shelf because it is a book by an experienced author. To be fair, this is not a book for a PowerPoint designer. Rather it is for everyday mom and pop PowerPoint users. Wish it was updated for PowerPoint 2007."
4,Great for the continuing my physcial therapy,The body blade is helping me to regain full use of my right arm and strengthen my should muscles after surgery for a fracture. Easy to use and gives you a very good workout.
5,Best exercize tool ever,"I can't decide whether it's the best therapy tool or best exercise tool. It does both. You won't find dust gathering on it, instead you'll get a workout like you won't believe and any pain in your joints will miraculously disappear. I was using this at my doctors office for physical therapy and I saved myself the money on doctor visits by buying it for myself to use at home. I use it all the time and I feel incredible!"
5,Good work out,This is better then the shaker that is now no the marker. Several more excerise's that you can do. And it's easy.
5,Great Exercise Alternative,"Elliptical trainer, stationary bike, hand weights, weight machine are all very good, but Body Blade is a great addition to those. I have them all and I actually get to use muscles that other exercise equipment don't always address. It's different, and gives you as intense a workout as you need."
2,Dissapointment,there are better out there . this gun misfires too much . i got it as a gift and didnt use it for two months otherwise i would have returned it and i am a big fan of dewalt maybe it was the rcoditioners fault but still look at others
3,Subtitled,"I didn't read all the review so I did not know that these movies were not in English but had English subtitles. I like to do things while watching movies and because I had to read the movie, I could do nothing else. This show came up in response to my search for BRITISH MYSTERIES, so naturally, I thought it was produced by the British, like Wallander. That being said, it was a good story; although, it made both Sweden and Denmark look dismally bleak. From what little I knew about these two countries, they are very temperate and lovely. You wouldn't know that from this movie. I've only watched the first one and the story was quite compelling so I'm not altogether displeased, but the other two episodes will be something I save for a rainy day."
4,Very good detective shows,"The writing is better than for the Maria Wern shows, which are similar in many ways. I do get a bit tired of shows in which the police officers' children are being put at risk, which occurs in two of these three episodes. The acting is excellent, and I enjoy the urban settings (Gothenburg and Copenhagen). I also enjoy the fallibility of the investigators."
4,Scott 4 you!,"If you are into Beck, Bobby Sichran etc check it out. Scott 4 will make all you donkeys sing the gospel like hip-hop honkeys! Track number 3 ""East winter"" is an amazing song. I have never heard anything quite like it.Yours trulyLouis Cochs"
3,Very cheap,"too hard, quality is low, feels cheap, while it is fit in its price, that's why I give one more star"
3,"Bulky case, hard to see Palm screen","This carrying case is well made and has room for credit cards, but the palm pilot slides around inside of its elasticized holder so that the screen is hard to read. Also, I thought it had a cash fold pocket that extended the length of the case. Instead, there is a small pocket behind the card slots that holds very little. The case is bulky and hard to use, so that I usually have to remove the palm pilot to make it accessible."
4,Very nice...,"This is a very nice case for the Palm M100. It is a little bulky if you carry it in your pocket, but I put mine in my briefcase, so it isn't a problem. The strap with the snap on it doesn't look like it will last forever, but it isn't fragile by any means. I looked at some cases with zippers, which would probably be more durable, but I didn't like the layout of any of them. Some say the strap gets in the way, but I just tuck it back when I hold the case.Overall, this is a very nice looking and handy case."
4,screen protection,"Nice product, Could use more velcro to keep the bottom of the Palm from sliding around."
3,Decent leather but does make M100 bulky,"Bought one of these for myself but passed it on to another Palm M100 buyer. The case opens only one way -- Palm on the right, slots for credit cards on the left. This makes the machine much bulkier to carry and, more importantly, awkward to use if you tend to approach the Palm from left as well as right.On the other hand, the new owner is absolutely thrilled with the quality of the leather and fascinated by the use of velcro to attach the Palm to the case. Moreover, she works her Palm on flat surfaces where the extra leather to the left is less bothersome than my approach of holding the Palm in mid-air. Conclusion? Try looking at this case open before you buy to be sure it suits your style."
2,Woulda been nice if it hadn't broken in the first 30 seconds,"The case looked nice and distinguished. I was happy as I took it out of the box and mounted my m100...I closed the snap.Then I opened the snap, and it broke. Tore right out.*sigh*Return Authorization, please."
3,Elegant but fragile...,"The Leather case is very elegant and fits nicely in the side pocket of my suit jacket (just a little bulgy). I carry it with me always and everyone compliments the case as extremely nice. It does a great job protecting the palm but the snap closure is very fragile. After three months with mine, the snap came right off the leather (the little hole that goes attached to the front of the case). I had to place a new snap with a riveter and render the credit card compartments useless. I am happy with it anyway and I dont think all of them have that quality flaw."
2,No stylus holder,"You stick the Palm to the case with velcro but then the case backing is up against the stylus, making it very hard to get the stylus out to use it. Very impractical.They could have easily solved this by creating a stylus pocket in the curved part of the case (where it folds). I will have to try to rig up something there otherwise the case will not be useful."
1,Purchased but not recieved!,I ordered this item 12/31/03. Ihave gotten no shipping info and I have no word wether the order went thru or not. That is unacceptable.
1,Something's wrong,"I don't wish to write a review, just wish to know how I can buy this item. There is no way to purchase this item on this site. I wasted 1/2 hour looking. What's wrong here."
5,great product great price,This is Perfect for homemade pizza. Very heavy and very durable. Makes rolling dough a lot easier to work with
5,cooking,"It is difficult to find a good marble rolling pin, but this one is excellent. You can even set it in the fridge for an hour so delicate dough is less likely to stick to it."
5,marble rollimg pen,my husband bought this for my birthday. i love it. the stand is so good to have it doesn't roll away on me when i set it down. all my other rolling pens have brokin or gone rusted on me. this one will never do that. its nice and heavy. i don't have to use so much prusher to roll the dough. the rolling is smooth. the dough doesn't stick to it. also my husband didn't have to spend an arm or a leg to get it for me. its such a great price.
5,Great for learning microbiology,"TOO indepth for the boards. I barely had any micro on STEP1, so these cards didn't really make a difference in my grade. THey are great to follow and use if you are currently in microbio for med school, but too indepth for the boards. There is a clinical vingette and great explainations and keypoints on each card. THey also reference to other cards which I thought was great for integration."
3,"Good cards, but didn't fit our curriculum","The cards have a lot of info on them and helpful schematic diagrams. However, the info that was on each individual card differed from what we needed to know for our med school curriculum so I spent more time crossing things out and adding in new info than I would have liked. This set is incredibly helpful if you need to know exactly what they present but next time I'll probably just make my own flashcards out of 5x7 index cards."
4,The book and CD,"Very good to hear repetition of positive self statements for future self talk. The only reason I gave this a 4 and not a 5 is because the books are a little long for younger children....but we just do a little at a time. The voice on the CD that goes with this book is very cute, we often just play it in the car without the book. The colors are bright and the quality is awesome!"
3,My daughter didn't like it,Its very short and not what I was expected((((After a minut of listening my daughter wanted turn it off...
5,Good for my daughters,"I like to play this CD to help create a happy and healthy background environment in the car for my daughters. One thing I really liked about this CD is that it encouraged my daughters, who are 5 & 7 years-old, to talk about what was talked about in the CD."
5,Valuable Message,"I bought this book for my nephews and they absolutely love it. It is the first children's book I have seen that not only has a story, but an important message as well. It teaches children to love themselves and be happy with who they are. It really boosts self-esteem and is a valuable lesson to teach all children. I would highly recommend it. It makes a great present."
3,Nice shirt but could be better.,"Shirt is so well made and good looking that I would not mind wearing it with some Jeans and sneakers on a weekend. Its very Durable and the Patches looks so awesome one says ""Mess with the best die like the rest"" it has the American Flag stiched on the sleve.sizes do come a little big. I am a Big Ultra Force/Rothco product fan,No doubt, but sometimes you have to have it tailored to the right sleve length etc. depending on your size."
4,"so far, so good","I've only been using this brand for about three weeks, but my tomato and pepper (capsicum) seedlings seem very healthy.I chose botanicare's problend because they are forthcoming about their ingredients, whereas others, such as general hydroponic's flora nova (which i used last summer), isnt as informative.But after purchasing, I did some cost factoring and found that the flora nova is slightly cheaper per gallon of solution produced.Bottle is recycleable #2 plastic."
4,Merry Christmas!,"This cat was a lifesaver for my 4 year old granddaughter. She had one since she was about a year old, always carried it with her. She lost it after moving and asked Santa for her kitty back.I was so pleased to have found it and made my granddaughters Christmas even more special."
4,Pretty good hatchet,I like the compact nature and it was very effective. I think perhaps the metal isn't quite as strong as I was hoping but the handle is sweet.
1,Project Management 101,"If you have never been exposed to managing software development before, you may find this book interesting (just as you would find your first class on project management). However, if you know about software projects in general, you will likely find that you wasted your money (and your time). Sullivan spent most of the book describing his experience at his company and how they ""succeeded"" their software development. He presents the problems they faced in a very high level view without really proposing or suggesting concreate solutions. Overall, this book tells you what problems exists in software development projects, but you probably already know these problems since you are looking at buying this book..."
4,Great insight into a company that does it right.,"This was a great book outlining many of the things a company did to succeed while under pressure. I enjoyed the ""Back at Work"" sidebars, annecdotes about how they applied the techniques in this book."
1,A Rip-off!,"Among all the med books I have bought in my life, this book disappointed me the most. I bought it since it came with PDA version, when no decent PDA software was available in dermatology.Although this book is titled ""Differential diagnosis,"" it only differentiates diseases depending on location and symptom. It does not mention risk factors, age, sex, co-morbidities, etc, which will guide us toward a certain disease.Yes, you can download the whole content of this book (incl 650 images) if you buy this book and scrath off the sticker on the book. However, the interface of the software is not mature enough, and it is difficult to navigate thru the software (unlike Skyscape software). Plus, the quality of the images, as you can imagine, are awful.When we can try most of the PDA software titles on the market before buying them, it is not fair not to let us try this expensive book+software combo.Once you scratch off the sticker, you can not return the book any more. I am really disappointed."
4,Great Compilation,This is a must have if you don't usually buy many CDs but like to listen to good music of different artists. I have also BST Vol.2 and it is a great option too.
4,Great Canadian Mix,"OK, firstly, this cd is brought to you by the not-as-good-as-mtv-but-better-than-mtvE music channel up here in Canada. We know good music when we hear it, or atleast i do, and this cd is totally sweet esp. if you are into early alternative artists, Third eye blind for example...don't be scared to just buy it, cause i bet you any money you've heard majority of these songs, listen to it and find yourself saying the 4 magic words ""Oh i know this..."" note: there are some draggy songs, so if worse comes to worse just down load the songs on your computer and make your own cd of the gooders. hope this has helped you make up your mind, cheers, and enjoy."
2,"Very glittery, but awful smell","I love how glittery this is both on skin and in hair, but the smell is very strong and unpleasant and it didn't seem to dissipate over the course of an hour."
3,Only okay,I felt that the glitter spray was so fine that it was barely noticeable in my daughter's hair. We kept adding more and more. She was supposed to be a star and we wanted her really glittery. It didn't work as we wanted it to. We wanted something more theatrical. Perhaps if you are using this for going out or a wedding it would be more subdued.
3,Not as good.,"This is the second book I've read from this author. The first one was He's got to go. I wasn't so impressed with this one and I felt she was dragging on the story. Also, ""He's got to go"" was not as predictable."
3,Not my Favorite,"Once I got through the book I liked ok. I actually got really bored in some parts and ended up skimming the book just to get through it. The author has too many characters going on. Really you only care about a few, but every time someone new was introduced you ended up having to read about every little thing that character was thinking and doing for the rest of the book."
5,Great read!,"I just finished reading this book and it was awesome! I really enjoyed the characters and the story was definitely a page turner. I'm quite pleased at the ending of this book (finally a book that did not let me down at the end). I recommend this book to anyone who is a hopeless romantic, like myself."
1,This book is laughable.,"I was really shocked at the amount of false information contained in this book. It seems as though the author was trying to make a statement at all costs, rather than presenting everything with a balanced perspective. If you do decide to base your opinion of these groups based upon this book, that would be tragic - it is necessary to take all of Urquhart's expositions with a very large grain of salt."
1,The Pope's Armada,"A great delusion to me. Nothing more than a lengthy, superficial, journalistic gossip on important and dramatic events and movements insidecatholic and universal world of these times. Religion is more than a society game. No justification of the naive but firm prejudices which animatesthe author's analysis of the catholic evolution. Religion involves deep individual and collective inspirations, desires, hopes. An entire spiritual world,which moves people and nations and changes history. Nice, good and simple feelings, sentiments are not enough."
5,Ground zero for the digital perspective,Having MP3 in the title is a little misleading. Gilbey's book sets you up for a deep understanding of the digital revolution long after MP3 has been superseded by next the compression format. If all you want from 'Mp3 and the Infinite Digital Jukebox' is help you grow your music collection then it will certainly do that. Where the book's real value comes in though is in its ability to show you the choke points in the digital entertainment industry. I would suspect Chris Gilbey is a name we'll be hearing of again and again.A quick and easy read. Highly recommended.
5,Mine came with 2050 mAh batteries,"I just bought this, and it works great. It's fast, but the fan keeps the batteries from getting hot. The batteries that came with mine were 2050 mAh, not 1800."
4,Good Product,The charger works pervfectly fine and charge within 30 minute as it says.But it able to charge only AAA and AA bateries. So I still need to keep my old one for charging 9 volts. There is a power cable and an adapter for the charger. I was expecting that it will be directly connectable to the wall outlet as my old one.
1,Duracell CEF90NC 30 Minute Charger with 4 AA NiMH Rechargeable Batteries,The batteries are really in bad condition. Even if its completely drained its not charging for more than 5 to 10 minutes and so its not possible to use it even for a single day in my camera. I am not able to take more than 60 to 70 photos using these batteries. I tried the charger with another set of duracel NIMH batteries and the charger is working fine.
1,"Bulky, picture does not show HUGE power adapter","This product was not used by our company since we thought people would lose the power adapter that is separate and not seen in the product photos, it is behind the package hidden."
4,For Duracell Only,"Great charger, works exactly as advertised. I tried to charge non-Duracell batteries in the charger with limited success. Recommend you use only Duracell batteries in the charger."
2,Rechargeable batteries,"These rechargeable batteries don't last very long. After just a few snaps of the camera, even fresh from the recharger, these batteries are too weak to work."
4,Great Product!,I purchased the charger with 4 battery plus another 8 pack. It charges extremely fast and it does hold the charge a lot longer than other rechargeable batteries. Great product from Duracell!
4,"Mixed reviews: Very fast, but construction a little flimsy","This product performs to expectations. I like that it can be used with AA and AAA batteries; and the speed with which it recharges the batteries is excellent.The construction is very lightweight. On the one hand, this is an advantage if you need to take it on the road. On the other hand, it is so lightweight that if feels a little flimsy. It probably couldn't handle being dropped multiple times.And while it's great that the product can be expanded to fit batteries of different sizes, the mechanism used to switch between the two sizes is a very basic mechanical sliding device that could probably get worn quickly. The construction of the slider doesn't seem like it would be adequate for customers who would need to recharge AA and AAA batteries on a frequent and consistent basis.But overall, it's a good product for the price (since it also includes 4 NiMH batteries)."
3,"Good charger, what's up with the batteries",This 30 min charger is great for recharging 4 AA batteries in a short period of time and it also charges AAA too. I have found that the batteries don't carry a full charge quite as long as regular battries. I was under the impression that NiMH battries tend to have a bit longer lasting charge than the old type of rechargeables. These battries don't die quickly but just register weak much longer than regular battries. Maybe thats the pay off???
2,Poor use,"I start using these rechargables few weeks ago,as an active musician I use a lot of equipment that need batteries,so far I use rechargeables for practice in my studio but for a gig it doesn`t look a good idea ,so I decided to use regular type of alkalines when I play for gigs,these batteries are not reliable. Andreas"
1,They don't hold a charge,"I bought this and 8 extra of these AA batteries. I take a lot of photographs and didn't want to have my flash run out.Three times I have tried to use these batteries and all three times one or more of them were dead. The time between charging and use ranged from a few weeks to a few months. So they don't hold a charge.I have never tried just using them right after charging. Usually I come home after trying to use them, recharge them all and put them back in the camera bag until next time. No more of this, I missed some important pictures a few days ago.I will stick to regular alkaline batteries and maybe if I decide to ever try them again, I will charge before I go out and see if they work then."
3,noni juice,"I have a bad habit of sometimes ordering health food items based on a recommendation(this one was a great sales job!)on a medical show on TV, as I did this one from a Dr. Oz segment. It is impossible to gauge the health benefits of a juice after one bottle or if one does not have some testing methods for specific markers before and after such a regime. I will chalk this one to impulse buying I do not plan to repeat, as I have no detectable health changes or improvements to report. It does not taste very good and is very expensive. The attractive Pom juice on the grocery shelf might be just as effective as an antioxident and be a lot more plesant to ingest."
3,Diskgo = So Slow,"I give the Diskgo three stars because if fulfills the purpose it is intended to do - provide extra memory to store stuff I don't want filling up my mac memory and slowing down my computer.However, transfer time is SO SLOW! I have been moving around quite a bit of stuff, but now way that it should be taking as long as it has. If you're looking for something speedy, I don't recommend the so slow Diskgo."
4,Cool action figures,i purchased these action figures to give along with dvd's of the Justice League. they're exactly what you see pictured..
1,Mainly Fiction,"An interesting book but the author keeps on getting fact and fiction confused. If you want to know in detail about the launch sites then the book is good. If you want to know about the system themselves there is very little in this book.The author has a tendency to present paper studies as if they were nearly ready for service. The nuclear V-2 design presented would simply not have worked, he has confused the design for a system to investigate V-2's breaking up on decent with a production system. The incomplete Coastal battery is just that not a V-2 Silo launch site. Watten was never designed for Silo launch of V-2 or A-10 missiles and the design he presents for Watten directly contradicts data from other researchers and original German plans.The A-10 was years away from first flight and was never tested in Poland. At one point he rambles on about 50 year old SS gas traps/mines!"
2,Poor visibilty with Double Wire below the Eyes,"This version of the Rawlings faceguard has a double wire right below the eyes which has caused some visibilty problems while while my 10 year old son is hitting. e.g. ""Mom, that one strike I didn't even see the ball because of my mask."" A better of the same mask only has one wire so it's better for visibilty. Of course this can vary a bit depending on the shape and size of your child's head."
5,Good Solid Advice,"This book is well written, making it a pleasure to read. In addition, the author has provided case references so additional details can be readily obtained if needed (plus it makes everything read with more credibility). I find the practical advise at the end of each article to be very useful and good solid advice. Since purchasing the book just a few weeks ago, two sections have proved to be immediately beneficial: Section 24 on Surety and Section 19 on Site Safety Risk and Responsibility."
4,Personal Opinion,"Icons of Horror shows the best and worst excesses of the Hammer studios. The Curse of the Mummy's Tomb while a little confusing is a very well done piece and The Gorgon is worth the value of the whole set in and of itself. However, The Two Faces of Dr. Jekyll is a very poor and overly drawn out retelling of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, even though it was interesting to see them make Jekyll the uglier of the two and Hyde the suave and handsome member of the pair, placing all of Hyde's ugliness on his inside. Scream of Fear is far too confusing and boring to comment on. All in all a good set if only for the Gorgon."
2,The Gorgon,Most of movies would be much better if they were the original. The movies on this dvd are the TV versions. The Gorgon was cut by 10 minute including the nude part and beginning plot. This 10 minutes make the movie much better.
4,Long wait finally The Gorgon!,"I've been waiting a long time for The Gorgon to get to DVD. Sorry, but I'm not real familiar with the other 3 movies, but the price of admission is worth it just for The Gorgon IMO. I'm a huge fan of Peter Cushing and The Gorgon is another great movie with him in it. I'll have to do a full review of all of them when I get this, but if you're curious right now, you can check the reviews of the VHS tape of The Gorgon."
4,Finally! The Gorgon!,"I own over 30 Hammer flicks on DVD, & there are only a few I do not own that I want to( the Cushing-less 'Horror of Frankenstein' is one available that I don't want, 'Kiss of the Vampire' I have 'cuz it came in a box set with other excellent Hammers I DID want ), and this release plugs a very BIG hole in my horror library, sub-group Hammer Films! 'The Gorgon', IMO, is up there with the Cushing Frankensteins & Lee Draculas.'Curse of the Mummy's Tomb' is not the best of Hammer, but it's hardly the worst - nice to see it in this set. 'Scream of Fear' & 'Two Faces of Dr. Jekyll' I cannot comment on as I have not seen them. But I will..........soon!"
3,Not What I Thought It Would Be,"It's alright, but does not have the more noted ""Hammer"" films included.It's so, so..."
2,purist only,scream of fear and 2 faces of dr. jekyll barely hold up.in dr j. you have to get past the phony beard. not a easy thing to do.the gorgon and the mummys tomb are almost laughable. i suggest the 20th century fox movies that are around the same time as universals which are still great classics.laird cregar hangover square and the lodger.
5,Love those Hammer films!!!!!,Icons of Horror Collection is a great way to get some of the lesser known but still great to watch Hammer films. Curse of the Mummy's Tomb is pure Saturday matinee stuff that harkens more to Univesal from the 40's than Hammer in it's syle and story telling. Scream of Fear is Sangster at his best with a great story and wonderful black and white photography. The 2 Faces of Dr.Jekyll is not themost successful adaption but still a worthy effort and a solid story.The Gorgon is the main reason I bought the set. You have in it both Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee and they are sensational in it. The twist is seeing Lee as the hero for a change and the direction by Terence Fisher is top notch. The movie was econimically shot but in Fisher's hands it is still a splendid movie. You will get many hours of Entertainment from this collection.
3,Had its moments woman seeks something for murders,"Normally I try to write more, but this film was neural. The typical story of a death and a mother seeking to find a reason for it resulting in the usual family disintegration and hopelessness of some sort of satisfaction. She was not that likeable a character and the ""pick-axe"" murderer had her moments but was still all screwed up. The movie kept my attention but not a real page turner. Same-o same-o story like with nothing really new. SORRY!"
5,Friendship Happens Anywhere,"A gripping, heart wrenching, tongue biting story of two women on death row who manage to become friends in this most unsavory situation. It is almost impossible to expect something good to come out of this friendship; but, it does, because it depicts the journey of two individuals from their sordid backgrounds to s solid, powerful friendship. The suspense and the evolution take place on death row."
5,Nice Toolkit for Anyone Consulting on Products/Services,A very good reference book for consulting engagements. Nice resource for anyone who wants to quickly learn or refresh frameworks and guidelines for any phase of a consulting work.
3,Photocopy Quality Printing,"I was unhappily surprised when I received the book.While I have not read the content of the book, the quality of the printing is atrocious.It appears that the original has been photocopied, the pages cut to size and pasted within a cover. While the text isclearly visible, many figures are faded. The paper itself is not the usual smooth book quality, but the slightly rougher document quality.This is the first textbook I have ever purchased that has been this quality.Upon contacting the publishers ""Pearson Prentice Hall"", I was informed that the sub-standard quality that they are putting out is due to the low demand for the book. I advise would-be purchasers to look to other alternatives and save themselves the $133 for a book that cost about $10 to print."
2,quality of printing is poor,"I am very disappointed in this order. This book costs $135 however the printing looks terrible, like it was an international copy. The printing is blurred on the covers and the inside words are sideways on the cover pages. The content looks like a xerox copy. I have yet to read the content but I am very upset about paying $135 for something that must have cost $10 to print!!!"
1,Dirty book,The book was labled New and came with crusty stuff on the front and back. I wiped it off but I won't be buying books from amazon anymore. This is the second time this has happened.
5,An excellent series.,"Ms. Hamilton, who is currently writing the 4th book in the series but is quite ill so there is no knowing when it may be done, does a masterful job portraying the period and the conflicting roles religion and magic played in people's lives. There is humor and suspense in a fast-moving story. This is a marvelous book in an excellent series. (Later note: Ms. Hamilton passed away in February 2005. Her 4th book remained unfinished.)"
2,Book Lover in Texas,"I was disappointed with this one. The description was for a used hardcover, but what arrived was an overly worn old library book. The condition was poor, and although it arrived in a timely manner, I would not use this vendor again."
1,Save your money for a better pillow,"Not too good. Like sleeping on a firm, unmoving blanket or something. Not sure why it's so uncomfortable for me, but I didn't like it. Maybe somebody who is a back sleeper would like it, but not a side or stomach sleeper pillow."
5,Rich resource,"Dividing the year into eight ritual seasons, the author has collected a wealth of information about the history of myths and rituals from a wide variety of traditions and cultures. She offers suggestions for internalizing the spirit of each season and provides thoughtful ceremonies for community use. The book is a wonderful source of interesting facts and thoughtful reflections."
4,Great Album!,"I have to start with the last song in the album. It is a master piece. With vocals by hope sandoval this (over 10 min long) song makes you understand the true power of music. you have to hear it to understand what i'm talking about.and now to the rest of this great album:the first song ""Leather"" is like a brilliant long opening to the second song ""Girls"" which is very good. ""Hands around my throat"" and ""scorpio rising"" are the most radiofriendly songs and they are really great. the rest of the album (with the exception of ""natja"") are songs with an alternative feeling and a great sound.this is one hell of an album.buy it."
3,Floating away into mushroom Hell,"This album gets 3 stars for ""Hands Around My Throat"" and the last track alone. Other than that, what we have here is a band that seems to be trading in musical innovation for redundant experiments in psychedelia. It almost makes the gutsy ""Contino Sessions"" LP look like a fluke. It's tough to tell if they'll pull it together for the next album, and for now I'm just going to assume they recorded this album while on a very bad, very extended mushroom trip. Because they really have proven themselves to be a great band in the past. Check out ""Contino Sessions"" and ""Dead Elvis."" They don't disappoint the way ""Scorpio Rising"" does."
5,Concepts of Genetucs,"Product met my satisfactions and received it just as how it was described and on time. Overall, a great purchase experience!"
5,Very happy,"I was very happy with my product. The book was in excellent condition and it was all way cheaper than what I would have paid at the bookstore, even AFTER waiting till the last minute and having to pay extra for next day delivery. I will definately use Amazon more frequently for my test books."
1,Not a good undergraduate text,"Have to agree with a previous evaluator....I am taking Genetics at a local college in an attempt to determine whether or not I wish to pursue graduate work in Molecular Biology. Very dry, unreadable, unimaginative. I'm certain there are far superior texts out there....I only wish my professor had chosen one of them. Again, as a previous reader stated, it makes the already difficult subject of genetics that more cumbersome to decipher!It is only the third week of the course so I can't say how I will fare in the class.....but I can unequivocally state that I hate the textbook, and certainly would not recommend it for an undergraduate course!"
2,Poor quality reproductions,"The reproductions of the famous Hildebrant paintings on these twelve magnetic postcards are of a very poor quality - dark, small and smudgy. Get the original calendars or the _Greg and Tim Hildebrandt: The Tolkien Years_ book instead."
4,Another addition to the collection,"My vote would be to 'save' not 'send' these 12 post cards of art by the Hildebrandt Brothers.These aren't postcards in the usual sense -- printed in full color on thick board, then laminated.Not your traditional postcard, each one is heavy, big (about 6 1/2 inches by 4 inches) and magnetic.A great gift for someone who loves Tolkien and the Brothers Hildebrandt, these could be given as separate gifts to 12 different people, as one (heavy!) gift to one person, or perhaps just kept and attached to a refrigerator.Scenes include City of the Ringwraiths, with GollumLord of the Ringwraiths Upon a Nazgul and the Lady of RohanBilbo at RivendellSaruman at Orthanc .... and moreI wouldn't get this instead of other art work, I'd get this in addition, to add to a collection.My two versions have pictures that are clear for the eye to see."
2,Bummer!,I've read several McMurtry books but wouldn't buy another one straight out of the shoot. This one was full of disappointment. It was over the top on unrealism and seemed to focus more on the the sex life of the lead character than anything else. I wonder if McMurtry actually wrote it?
1,Burn all books of fiction,"Books of fiction and Holy wood are on equal footing. both are fakes. Actors pretend just like writers of fiction. If either of these are your bag, go see a shrink. I fee for you."
2,dissapointing,"this earns a low mark for an author that I usually enjoy enormously. I couldn't finish this, I was bored silly by the cartoon-like Nellie Cortright"
1,"All about the money, eh Larry?","Maybe his worst yet, if he indeed wrote it. McMurtry somehow went from being an extraordinary writer to someone who now cranks them out for the money.I am a great fan of his early works but will not buy another of his books. I have been burned too many times in the past fifteen years."
2,A Tired Book From A Tired Writer,"Telegraph Days is less than 300 pages but seems endless and I just couldn't take anymore with less than 100 pages to go. The plot is formulistic of every other McMurtry western, the characters clown like and we have seen every narrative device before. McMurtry seems to be parodying himself. Don't waste your time on even this short read. Maybe he should do something else besides write for a while.Why the two stars? One for McMurtry's body of work plus one for the fact that he can still tell a story, even if it is a bad one."
1,Read If You Must,"I love McMurtry's writing--I feel that ""Lonesome Dove"" will go down in history as one of the great American novels.But this novel just doesn't make it.You keep anticipating and hoping for something exciting to happen. Anything! But it never does.It just rolls on and on with the next page pretty much like the one before it.There is one brief incredulous gunfight and that's pretty much it.The ""star"" is a promiscuous woman who runs the telegraph station and has a dim-witted brother who is deputy sheriff. Read it if you must. Maybe you will like it."
1,Simply Dreadful,"What the hell, Larry? Do you have so little regard for your readers and fans that you would throw together this horrible mish-mash of silliness and call it a novel? I would think a Pulitzer Prize-winning author would have more pride.If you were trying for the dime novel style, then the book shouldn't cost as much as your fully-fleshed novels because that is misleading (not to mention overpriced.)I couldn't even finish this book, it was such an annoying waste of time. Future readers beware...And Larry- how about actually trying to write a good, well-crafted novel next time? Your fans deserve it."
3,Somewhat enjoyable,"I have to admit I was a little disappointed with this novel. It's not a bad read, but it just didn't pull me in enough to really enjoy it, and the writing seemed a little over the top. Granted, I don't read Westerns much, I only read this because I just read The Assassin by Rye James and thoroughly enjoyed that, so I wanted to pick up another Western. Though there were parts of the book I really liked, there just wasn't enough for my tastes."
3,Western Fun,"I found Telegraph Days entertaining, but somewhat fluffy (of no real substance). It lacked any definitive plot line. I do not regret reading it, because it was a quick read. However, I don't think that I would recommend it."
4,Wonderfully entertaining!,"I am a first-time reader of Larry McMurtry and can't wait to read another one of his novels. Telegraph Days has wonderfully entertaining and I thoroughly enjoyed all of the characters, especially the narrator, Nellie Cartwright. If you don't have a sense of humor and don't like to laugh, this book is not for you. I would also recommend listening to this book on tape. The performance by Annie Potts really brings the characters to life."
4,fun and breezy,"This is a fun and breezy summer read. I had sworn off Larry McMurty the last few years because his books seemed to have become less and less fun and endearing and more and more depressing and sad. With this one, the fun and endearing parts dominate. It's lot's of fun and an easy read.Actually, I listened to the unabridged audio edition narrated by Annie Potts. She was truly splendid in the role of the brassy heroine."
3,A whole new nooky at the wild west...,"My grand mother and her brother were orphansfrom the Oklahoma area who were sent east to St. Louis.My grand father's family lost 4 brothers andsisters and an uncle in Arkansas before moving totamer St. Louis. This story is about a southern belland her brother orphaned in the Cimarronwho turned writer and telegraph operatorwho says she knew all them heroes ( intimately?).Western fiction as fiction about dime novel (25 cent?)authors.A book bout when turning the killing of dirty mean drunksinto dollars on paper was a new business.Not as good as Pretty Boy Floyd,but certainly a new twist on the old west."
1,Droll,I would have possibly given the audiobook 2 stars if not for Annie Potts doing the audio. Not the best voice for audiobooks.
2,Larry can do so much better,"I was quite disappointed. Heroine seemed very unrealistic. Larry' M's awesome talent seemed shelved for this book. Also the boy who shot the 5 bandit brothers in the heart with 5 bullets? Wha - ? That is just cheezeball comic book! Sorry, Larry, but this book was not worthy of you."
2,Third-rate Effort by a (formerly) First-rate Author,"Larry, Larry, Larry -- I don't know what you had going on when you wrote this book, but try not to go there again. This minimal effort on your part required too great a suspension of disbelief on mine. Because of Lonesome Dove and Terms of Endearment, I stayed with you through the entire book, shaking my held most of the way. One star is supposed to mean ""I hate it."" I didn't; there was not enough there to generate that much emotion."
1,"""Telegraph Days"" is unfortunate history","Telegraph Days appears to be an attempt at writing a novel in the shortest time possible and living off your laurels. It is a glued together assembly of period characters - Hickok, Cody, Custer, Earp Bros, and a 22 year old young women who knows everyone, everything. The later skips merrily through life impervious to everything including VD. Nancy Drew would even find this character and novel totally unbelievable.This book isn't worth opening, has no plot or story line and has no redeeming values other than author royalties.Sorry Mr. Mc Murty, but this is not an example of your good work."
1,Ambushed!,"A McMurtry fan, I found this book totally disappointing. In the final stages of his career, he apparently is just coasting. Some day, someone will write a great novel about the last years of the American West and someone else will make an epic movie about it but this poor effort leads me to believe that McMurtry has peaked and is now on a long slide into obscurity. If Telegraph Days had been written by an unknown author it would have sold a couple hundred copies...to the author's friends and relatives. For some reason McMurtry seems to want to debunk that period in American history. Western story aficinados should rent a copy of Tombstone rather than spending 8 bucks for this novella, which belongs in one of the old western story magazines that were forgotten and discarded after a quick read."
2,An Old West Fable,"Somewhere between Forest Gump, and Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. I wasn't expecting much from the airport bookstore, but got sucked in by Larry McMurtry's reputation. At least a better read than the In-Flight rag."
3,Disappointing,"""Telegraph Days"" is aptly titled. The narrative seems like a pithy and staccato telegram rather than a novel.The novel starts off strong with Nellie and her brother Jackson burying their father whose suicide has left them orphans in No Man's Land, a desolate part of the West claimed by no state.True there is humor, action, sex and a plethora of famous names as Nellie and Jackson go on with their lives across a swath of the American West. But this longtime McMurty fan was disappointed by the lack of depth in the characters and a thin plot that simply dwindles to a drawn out end.Nellie seemed to me just another replay of Tasmin Berrybender with a different name and less reality.I expected more from the man who gave us ""The Last Picture Show,"" ""Lonesome Dove"" and ""Zeke and Ned."""
3,Not a Pulitzer Prize Winner,"This book is no ""Lonesome Dove."" It is light reading and will take no time to read through it. My main complaint is that much of the time it seems really contrived, and it became annoying at times. The fact that she would meet all these western legends is pretty unlikely."
2,Very Disappointed,"I'm a Larry McMurtry fan from way back, but to be honest I only made it halfway throug this book. I have a stack of promising fiction I need to dive into and didn't have time to waste on this book. I agree with another viewer who called this book ""contrived.""The female lead character really grates on the nerves after a while. She reminds me of a slightly slutty Pollyanna.Maybe I should've seen the book to its finish, but I couldn't because I was bored to tears. Hope I'm not being unfair and trying to measure the worth of Telegraph Days against Lonesome Dove, which is one of the greatest works of fiction I've ever read.Maybe next time, Mr. McMurtry."
4,Just a little better than good...,"I loved the 'Lonesome Dove' series because it was brutal, bloody, and exciting. I guess I was expecting that in this one. Didn't get it. This was a good story, however. I would describe it as a sorta a Western Forrest Gump. Except Forrest was a woman and bright. She met everyone famous in the West and even managed to live long enough to see movies."
1,McMurtry's having fun at readers' expense,"Lonesome Dove was a great novel. Telegraph Days is a piece of junk and I should demand my money back, but since I forced myself to read the whole thing, I think it's unlikely. Larry - way to piss off your loyal readers! I think this is your way of poking fun at your fans, which is not a nice or even honest thing to do. My complaints:1. The plot....what plot?2. The main character....all I can say is, you have no conception of how women think or feel. I realize she is your ""feminine alter-ego"", but really....3. The pearl trick was where I totally gave up on something interesting happening.My advice, dear readers....don't waste your time or money on this one."
3,DISAPPOINTED!,I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS CD/DVD. NOT ENOUGH OF DEAN MARTIN HIMSELF. I DID NOT REALIZE IT WAS NOT GOING TO HAVE ACTUAL FILM FOOTAGE (NOT JUST PHOTOS) OF DEAN & CAN BARELY GET PAST THE ARTISTS WHO FEEL THEY ARE TALENDTED ENOUGH TO EVEN SLIGHTLY MEASURE UP TO SUCH AN ALL-TIME GREAT LIKE DEAN MARTIN. NONE COMPARE IN VOCAL TALENT OR COOL. DEAN MARTIN WAS AND ALWAYS WILL BE A BRIGHT STAR ALL BY HIMSELF! NOBODY LIKE HIM - NEVER WILL BE.THANKS FOR THE EFFORTS THOUGH; DEAN NO DOUBT SMILES UPON YOU ALL AS HE WALKS AWAY...... FOREVER COOL.
4,Luminating,"What can I say about this book it came at fast timing,it is a classic of mine I have enjoyed for years and more to come. I first read this as a young boy several times over. It's just as I remember it."
5,The best book in the world!,"This must be, if not the best, one of the best books in the world! Read it! It's a fantastic, fun, lovable, great book with everything in it. I read it first when I was nine or ten years old, and I fell in love with it at once. A luminary who becomes a dog... that is a very fascinating story. Read it!!!"
3,delightful tale of a celestial being in the body of a dog,"Sirius, the dog star, is wrongly accused of a crime due to his hot temper and sentenced to roam the Earth in the body of a dog. With the help of the Earth, Sol (the Sun), the Moon, and his owner, the downtrodden orphan Kathleen, Sirius must over come his doggy-instincts, find the Zio, a celestial weapon, and solve the mystery of who framed him. If he can pick up some table scraps along the way, all the better. Jones' characteristically charming and magical story elements and multi-layered characters weave an engaging and enchanting tale contrasting pets/animals with celestial bodies, though this one is much weaker than her other offerings (the Howl and Chrestomanci books, for instance). A fun read for young readers and dog lovers. (Side note: I must guiltily admit that I was motivated to read this due to the lead character sharing his name with another beloved wrongly accused character from the fantasy genre.) Grade: B+"
3,Good...but not great,Whilst I enjoyed this book I didn't love it. I found that whilst it wasn't very long it still took me a few days to read. If I really loved the book I would have finished this in a day. I liked the idea of the book and felt sympathetic to both the main characters Sirius & Kathleen yet it just wasn't as compelling or engrossing as I thought it would be. If you are a doglover you should add an extra star to my review. Jones is a good author but I don't think this is her best work.
2,well....,i gained weight back as soon as i stop taking the pill..while i was taking it.. i loosed about 5 poundswell... this works for a month but after that i dont know
3,"Fine for a few nights, but","The Big Agnes was excellent at holding air and providing cushion from the hard ground, but it was slick, real slick! If you are on even the slightest incline, by morning, you can expect to be on the ground at the foot of the Big Agnes. Two more good point - easy to inflate and lightweight."
5,Amazing!,Wonderful book for novice or expert. Information and artwork lavish and widespread. Don't normally go for this but this book is really great!
4,satisfied customer,"a great banner for any pats fan. good size, vibrant colors, good quality cloth. should last for years if kept out of direct sunlight."
5,Living beautifully in dangerous times,"There are many books about the kindertransport, but this one stands out above the others for the great literary value of the writing and the original insights of a truly wise child--the author Edith Milton as a young girl. This is, in fact, not exactly a book about the kindertransport, though it is the Nazi tyranny and a few feverish months leading up to the outbreak of war, when several thousand Jewish children were allowed to leave Germany on the kindertransport that prompts the story. For readers who savor the perfect detail, original characterizations, and clear, elegant language given in pursuit of story, this book about how an ad hoc family lived and even prospered during one of the most dangerous moments in English history will be deeply satisfying. Highest recommendations, too, for yournger readers as a coming of age story. There is nothing here, for all the danger implicit in Edith's young life, for parents to fear."
3,This is a diary of life in England,"This is not about the kinder transport. Nearly all of the book concerns life after the transport. It's a pleasant memoire, but be clear on what you're buying."
5,Performance Management: Improving Quality and Productiivty,"I have used this book to teach PM to Managers, Supervisors and hourly since 1993...I recommend it to anyone who wishes to make improvements in performance. This book makes improvements painless and it encourages all who participate.This book has helped turn around more than one company SUCCESSFULLY!!!"
5,R+,"With reservations I slowly embraced Dr. Daniels work over 20 years ago while working for Eastman Kodak. I was completely won over to the R+ lifestyle after seeing hundreds of thousands of dollars in savings coming from workers that months earlier could not give a dam about quality. Along with ideas and training from visionaries like Edwards Deming, working with R+ is a great way to create quality products. Kodak has fallen on hard times because it did not stay current with technology. Unfortunately for many, Kodak has lost it's way. When everyone in a organization is on the same page, the work environment in any shop will turn into a very rewarding place. Thank you Dr. Daniels."
5,Very happy!,"I got this book just a few days after ordering and I was very pleased. The book looked brand new and was purchased for a great price. Great product, very happy!"
2,Could make people feel like animals,"Daniels' book provides some great examples of how not to manage, and sure, rewarding and congratulating employees for a job well done is always in order. However, this book basically propogates classical conditioning in the workplace. Sure, it probably works for bottom level employees or simple hard labor tasks, however, anyone with a high school education could very well resent the practices presented in this book.I'm reading it for a graduate level course in workplace communication outside of the psychology department, and I think it's important to note that my industrial-organizational psychology professors have completely debunked this book. Also, the relevant professional, peer-reviewed journals for applied behavior analysis (what this book teaches) primarily deal with handicapped children, such as those with autism, and pizza delivery drivers. Makes you wonder...."
1,Outdated,"The content of this text is drastically outdated. It's based on Skinner's behaviorism theories which have been mostly overturned by recent neuroscience studies. I just finished my masters degree in neuroscience and was hoping to see the new brain studies alive and well in corporate performance management. The Harvard book is much better, but still doesn't reflect new discoveries in brain science."
3,Instant Party-The Everly Brothers,"I really like some of the songs on the CD, especially ""Jezabel"". But on the whole, the CD's format wasn't typically in The Everly Brothers style."
3,A middle-of-the-road performance graced by lovely playing,"The Royal Concertgebouw enters the field with its own label, a tactic that has proven very successful for the London Sym. This live performance of Ein Heldeleben is caught in ripe but somewhat distant sonics that tone down the excitement a bit, all the more because Jansons seems satisfied with a scrupulous, detailed account that holds back on drama--I supose he doesn't want the piece to sound garish. But why not? Heldenleben isn't much unless you play the wheels off it. Compared to Simon Rattle's outstanding new version with the Berlin Phil., this one is middle-of-the-pack, despite the warm, gorgeous playing of the orchestra (and a particularly fine solo violin in the long obligatto part). I find nothing to criticize here and next to nothing to rave about."
5,Exceptional interpretation,"This is a live performance, evidently, of the Ein Heldenleben magnificent tone poem by Richard Strauss. It features the superb violin solos by then Concertmaster Alex Kerr, which are scintillating and luscious...I wouldn't have minded closer miking on these solos, but it is a live performance! The orchestra is energetic and full throttle in the big moments under the direction of Mariss Jansons. Really worth a listen!"
2,"An underwhelming ""Hero""","This disc IMO,acts as little more than a memento for those people who were actually present at this concert to mark the inaugeration of Jansons as chief conductor of the RCO.The meagre playing time(approx.45 mins)and recessed recording,not to mention the fact that this is not really a great interpretation prevent a serious recommendation. As far as I am concerned this does not represent good value for money."
3,Not bad reference book...not completely up-to-date,"I normally refrain from recommending Microsoft Press books because so many of them are printed versions of their online help or MSDN content. If you want to learn XML from the ground up, this book isn't for you. If you're familiar with the concepts of XML and have wanted more clarification on how to use XML as a tool within your applications, then you should look at this book.It does offer decent explanations of XML and XML technology, and it does offer examples in VB, C++, and Java, but code itself isn't well documented.There is mention of the .Net Framework and Visual Studio .Net, but the book was obviously written before either of them went ""gold"", so don't expect to see examples of XML Web Services using .Net.All in all, its a good reference book and worth looking into getting (as long as you don't pay full retail price for it.)"
4,EDIT: First Impression--Some Reassurance?,"So I just got this axe couple days ago in the mail, and at first impression the steel head and handle feel really cheap. I don't know if it's the coating on the head, but it almost feels like a hard plastic. It's not as sharp as some of the axes I've used. Then again, it's first impression. After I test it this spring, or after I backpack along some of the Continental Divide this summer, I'll come back and change my review. For now, let me know if anyone had a similar first impression, and how did it turn out for you?*****EDIT*****Alright, after a small spring trip, I've found this axe phenomenal. Has good balance, and after a recommendation to shave off a bit of the teflon, the edge sliced through fire logs no problem. Overall I am happy with my purchase and a great product. Only Amazon slightly over did it with the packaging. When it arrived, I thought I accidentally bought some 3 ft. chopping axe. Box was thrice the size of the actual Gerber box."
5,Better than I expected,"I ordered this for my different outdoor oddjobs, but was completely surprised when I got it. I though it'd only be good for clearing out small trees, but it's proven to be very effective in taking out much larger trees. It also came very sharp, and right out of the box it worked great. I would recommend this to any person who enjoys the outdoors, because this is a tool you can't live without!"
4,Description not entirely true..,"The axe seems well made although it isn't as sharp as I would like but my problem is that the sheath isn't really a sheath.. It is not Nylon but a plastic cover. Not exactly what I had in mind when I was buying it and I am a very disappointed with the product description. With that been said, I think the price for the product IS worth it."
3,nice axe,"axe seems good and durable. the handle is REALLY slippery, almost dangerous. i ended up wrapping my with tape. the ""sheath"" is not a sheath at all, but a hard piece of plastic with a handle. it's ok, but not a traditional sheath. Overall the axe is sharp,heavy duty, and a very decent camp ax"
5,Solid Axe,I bought this axe to go to the Boundry Waters with some friends being that I've had good luck with Gerber in the past i decided to keep going with it and get the Gerber Camp Axe. It could not be a better tool me and my friends beat the crap out of it and did things that probably should have broke it other then a few chips off of the blade from trying to cut rocks with it...stupid friends its in mint condition.
4,Almost perfect,The axe is almost perfect. The only thing that needs improvement is the thickness/slickness of the handle. It is hard to hold and grip while chopping. I bought and applied some gripping used on tennis rackets and that appears to do the trick.
5,CAMP AXE HEAVEN,this was a Christmas present for my husband He can't wait to go camping to get to use it.
3,Worked fine for 16 months,"Worked pretty well for 16 months of PA use in our venue. Not a heck of a lot of power, but it got the job done for background music and speech using corded and wireless mics. Then, without warning, it went kaput. No power to amp, blown out. Tech said he had never seen it before from this model. Power is going to aux power (wireless mic gets powered through this), but no power to the amp (light doesn't come on). Made in China. In my opinion, you're gambling with this one."
1,Not DVD resolution,"I bought the DVD and feel cheated. The fire scenario is pleasant enought, but evidently the DVD was made from the VHS tape version since the resolution is far below DVD quality. All the videos are fuzzy; even worse than the VHS format since they were made from that generation copy. Why couldn't they have done this DVD right and used a high-quality digital source instead of re-copying their old tape? Could it have cost significantly more? No. It only takes a simple digital camcorder."
3,First 35 years left off the 5 additional years.,"This book is identical to the book ""Disneyland: The First Thirty Years"": I was a bit disappointed to see that about 90% of the pages are identical; 5% of the pages, the photos are identical, just a different size and place on the page a bit differently. If you don't have either of the Disneyland: the First.. thirty or thirty five years, definitly get one of them. I love the photos. Nice black & white, and color photos. I gave the previous book (the first thirty years 5 stars) these books are very good. But don't waste your time or money on this one, IF you have the copy of Disneyland: The First Thirty Years. Just a friendly warning."
2,The Limits of Readability would be more accurate,"I purchased this book because I have a great interest in the most deadly of ordnance; the atomic bomb. I was hoping for a book that was slanted towards the actual weapons system. Instead, this book is a treatment of how the concept of safety applies to the Nuclear Weapons Program.While interesting, and well researched, it was a bit of a strrrretch to read at times. If you are into nukes, you'll be fatigued. If you are an OSHA or Site Safety Guy, this book will be a good reference for your work."
4,"Quality Product, Prompt Delivery, not Packaged as Shown","Product arrived on time and with a surprise small free sample; however, was packaged in silver storage bag (not resealable) and not in the reusable bucket with cap as illustrated. Less than perfect rating based on misleading packaging."
5,Relaxing,"Perfect for a long day. Also, I have ecxema so it keeps me out of my dermatlogist office :)"
4,Natural Dead Sea Salts,Great deal and plan to order more.I ordered enough for myself and my daughter.Beats the 'Spa-Type' products with prices for scented salts that cost 3 to 4 times as much. I do prefer to add my own oils etc.
3,relaxing time,This salts make you relax and they take care of your body aches. I bought them for my psoriasis but I don't see changes on my skin.
3,worried about the boy,"It was a good movie. Didnt really dive into the other characters because it is a movie about Boy George. It did talk about his drug addiction but not how or who got him hooked, and didnt really go into a lot of detail about Culture club. All in all, it did shed a lilltle light on Boy George and his rise and fall to fame. Interesting and insightful @ times, like hopping in a time machine and reliving the 80's. And on that note, its a must see."
2,depressing,"I don't know how this movie come about or if it was an authorized biographical kind of thingy....but watching this was depressing. It was basically spasmodic memories of a drug addicted pop star put on film..or so it seems. It covers up to the heroin ordeal when he first lost his visa to the United States. I remember that time...I was diva-stated.The movie does give you some interesting names, a tragic love story from the beginning, and a father who loved his son. It was boring to watch, but any fan will.The Boy George will always be one of my big interests, and I will always love his beautiful voice. I would have rather had a new album, rather this movie...to be honest."
1,BAD & BORING,Don't waste your money and time watching this movie. It was boring from beginning to end. Spice World is a billion times better!!!
5,Douglas Booth IS Boy George,"I had always liked Boy George's music but had known little about him as a person. Worried about the Boy is done so well and young Douglas Booth as Boy George is great. The movie shows the progression of a boy who is lost and gradually finds his path...although there is lots of pain along the way. I watched it 3 times and liked it better each time. I think Douglas Booth is an amazing actor...he BECAME Boy George with all the pathos, hurt, daring-ness, and outrageousness. Wonderful movie and great acting."
2,Friction,I am sorry to say that everyone I have used this on has stated that it felt like it was being dragged along their skin causing a friction effect. Might go for the more expensive cover. Hopefully that will feel better to them!
3,Telomerase Book,"This book should be called Telomerase Book. Very detailed and helpful on telomerase assays but nothing satisfactory on telomere assays actually there is not one single protocol on actual telomere length measurement (only one method for detection one for distribution).If you research the activity go for it, is a good book but if you want information on the length like me this is not a book for you."
5,COMO CUIDARTE DE TU AGRESOR,"Este libro te dá las armas para poder enfrentarte ante tu agresor, ya sea en el trabajo o en tu escuela o en cualquier lugar, porque hoy en día la perversidad del hombre a aumentado y tenemos que cuidarnos de todos... Este libro es ideal, ya que te enseñará métodos para poder GUARDARTE CON INTELIGENCIA DE TODO PELIGRO.."
4,My Hamsters love it,The love the little spaceship cock-pit. that hamsters always drop food from their mouth when running in the treadmill so it makes a lot of noise since it's inclosed. That would be my only complaint.
2,Wheel can catch dwarf hamster inside,"I love all the tubes and extra pieces but the wheel is a problem. We have a dwarf hamster. The opening for the enclosed wheel is at the bottom, but the wheel we got does stay very steady, so it rolls over when the hamster gets in. Hence, the opening is now at the top, which means he can't get back out. We were worried about this and on the first night I woke up hearing our little guy running on it, so I ran down to check on him. He was indeed stuck and looked like he was exhausted and scared. He basically kept running and running because he could never get up high enough to get back to the opening. We have not played with it to see if there is another fix, but the rest is cool."
4,Very good attachments,"I've had these attachments before, one tip, do not buy this for any syrain, teddy bear hamster. I had a teddy bear hamster with these attachments. It got fat and the little playhouse thing with the green lid popped open and there went my hamster. I'd recomend this for only dwarf hamsters or possibly winterwhite, not syrian, or any bear hamster. And the purple tube has a lot of tiny holes which of course so your hamster could breath the one bad thing is if the hamster pees in there. The wheel is really nice but ANNOYING! My brother has a fancy syrian hamster and I gave him the wheel and that thing is running on that thing 24-7. And my hamster Chip who is a chineese dwarf hamster loves that wheel so I want this for Christmas for chip. :)"
5,Pet Critter Kit,"Just purchased the Super Pet Critter Trail Activity Accessory Kit for my daughter's hamster cage. It took a little while to figure out how to assemble it, but it is an awesome add-on to the little guy's cage. He loves it, and my daughter loves it. The hamster is in that wheel all the time!"
1,Horrible wheel,"DO NOT BUYThe tubes, outhouse, and round-about are ok. However, the wheel is a piece of junk. The axis broke right off while assembling with extremely light pressure. Unlike the cage wheel of CritterTrails, the axis is not flexible plastic so pressing the two prongs together caused one to break off. Upon attempting to attach it to the cage, the tab on the side panel of the cage also broke off. So a broken/defective product plus a broken cage that was originally in great condition.Contacting support is also useless as they do not get back to you."
3,VERY unpleasing,"I bought this item for my gerbil ""Emily"" and I have to say it's pretty neat and loved it..... then! I came home from work one day and saw she ate right through the ""Outhouse"". she got out of her cage but I had a towel in front of the door so she coudn't get out of the room. I took the wheel off to clean it. I had to use pliars to pinch the thing that keeps it together. I started wiggling it and all the sudden one of the sides of the pinch things flew off. I coudn't get it to go back on with super glue. I accidentaly super glued the wheel.So I would highly recommend not getting this if you dont like your room smelling like rat pee or have gerbils that eat everything."
3,Hamsters love the wheel but...,"We bought this for our ever expanding hamster kingdom. The wheel is a favorite but it needs to be cleaned at least every other day due to the accumulation of pee & poo. The wheel is somewhat difficult to attach & equally difficult to dissemble for cleaning. Putting it back on proved much easier.The look out section was not too difficult to assemble. The bubbly purple thing has ventilation, which also means pee leakage. The""out house"" is easy enough to clean.Overall,it is a pain to unassemble & reassemble to get it thoroughly clean, but I'd recommend just getting the wheel--or actually 2 wheels. You'll be cleaning it A LOT."
3,Will need more than this if already have CritterTrail cage,"We have the CritterTrail cage already and thought this would just attach to the other side where there is a ""plug"" whole. Well it doesn't go there. We have had to take down the nifty fancier wheel to put this unit up. I suspect this would be best with a simpler model of cages or in an aquarium maybe, or if you plan on building a high-rise labyrinth for your little furry friends."
1,not GOOD,"this product is only good for dwarf hamsters a large hamster will not fit in the tubing, also they dont ship ups only USPS and the package got so beat up it arrived in pieces if you want this for your dwarf its fabulous just order from a different place."
5,Great for my Robo Dwarf Hamster,"I bought this for my robo dwarf hamster. It took about a day for her to explore it. I put a little bit of bedding in the outhouse and she uses it as her bed. I like the wheel because it is outside of the cage, but I also still left the old wheel inside her cage. She uses both wheels to pee in, so I am going to buy a seperate outhouse with the litter in it and see if she will switch. (LOVE THAT YOU CAN KEEP ADDING TO IT) The pieces went well together, but the way I set it up it was a little wobbly so I just placed a folded up pillow case to hold it in place. The wheel did not have that problem, it hooked on fine and did not have to use anything to hold it up. The part that was wobbly was only wobbly because of the way I hooked it up on top, so it was top heavy. all in all it is a nice product and the wheel is bigger than I had expected."
3,my hamster loves it,"My hamster loves it, likes to sleep in it, but the tubes are kinda hard to clean and he pees in the tubes and it gets through the vents on the table.so you have to put something under it. giving it 3 stars because, it can be messy."
4,Has its pros and cons,"We had to separate our gerbils when they started fighting. Now one of them uses the outhouse as an outhouse (never knew they were potty trainable) and the other one uses the loop-d-loop as her potty. The wheel is nice because it does free up indoor space - however, my gerbils pooed in it all the time and the poo got flung all over the place (yuck)! So we no longer use the wheel. I am thinking of trying to set it up for the one who now lives in an aquarium. I do like all the tubes. Can you have too many tubes?!"
2,So-so,"It goes together just fine, but there are a couple things that could be improved:the ring at the top has tiny holes all over it. This is so that the hamster can breathe, obviously, but it becomes a problem when the hamster pees up there.The outhouse part is okay, except that the door is at an angle, which makes it tough to open.The wheel is fine. It is especially nice if you have a smaller cage because it attaches to the outside. It can be a bit squeeky, but we just spray a bit of cooking oil into the center bar and it stops.The entire thing (except the wheel) can be difficult to get into place tightly so that it does not wiggle.Overall, the wheel is the most useful part of the kit."
3,"cute but watch latch on ""outhouse""","It is a cute set, hamster immediately started using outhouse as bed but either my daughter didn't close it well one day or our hamster got it open (latch is not very good) so we decided not to use that piece anymore. Wheel is really good, saves space being on outside and larger then the one the cage came with. The purple loop is a little top heavy so keep that in mind when figuring out set up. Overall good for the money and always need more tubes to make it fit so if you don't have any may want to buy the additional set."
3,Good accessory kit but I could do without the wheel.,"I purchased this accessory kit for my daughters hamster cage and it was a very nice addition. We have 2 robo hamsters that like to use the outhouse to sleep in. I mainly purchased this kit for the so called ""quiet"" wheel, even when cooking oil it still made a lot of noise when it is being used, though not as much as the original wheel that came with our cage. Also, we have had a lot of problem with the hamsters using the bathroom in the wheel and it falling out below as well as when they use the bathroom in the loop-d-loop so if you use either or both, you may want to put something below them to catch what falls out. Our hamsters seem to enjoy this kit though and I would recommend it if purchasing through Amazon because its about half of what you would pay at a retail store and I don't believe this kit is worth the 25.95 list price. When I purchased this item it was $13.80 and I feel that is a good price for this kit."
5,Got it already!,"It was exactly what I was looking for, at the perfect price, easy to assemble, my pet Lil G loves it and I got it in 2 days!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Not as cool as it seems,"First up, the wheel is not as silent as it seems. It might sound pretty quiet if you spin it with your hand but when the hamster is using it, it sounds different. It's mainly because the rode that's holding the wheel is a little too long for the wheel and the wheel end up wobbling along the rode. This causes the sound to be rather unbearable at night. To fix this, I applied a drop of cooking oil on the rod and tied a small rubber band at the end of the rod (to prevent the wheel from wobbling). The little house is pretty nice but unfortunately, neither of my hamsters like to spend their time in it. As for the purple loop, it's pretty big and it's a nice place for the hamsters to chill. But because it's attached horizontally, be ready to have something below it to catch the pee.After trying out different configurations for several months, I'm only using the wheel now."
2,rip-off after shipment,I received a bill for shipment of $100.00 9/11 when it is supposed to be free .The weld machine had been tampered with and I complained to Hobart Company. Bottom line I'll never buy from Amazon again!
4,Stax Profiles,"It was thirty years ago when my brother first introduced me to a singer that he had heard while living in San Diego California. He did not tell me the singer's name at all. He simply said,""Listen."" After the first 30 seconds, I could not contain myself."" Who is this!"" I blurted out. He smiled and said,"" That's Rance Allen."" First of all, the songs were different. They were very catchy and uplifting.(The beginning of contemporary gospel) But what I could not believe was Rance's incredible range! It simple floored me! Now that I have a son that sings and plays drums,guitar, bass, and keyboards, I have introduced him to the music that I grew up listening to. I take great pleasure in introducing Rance Allen's music to a new generation.Great Album & Great Service,Harold A.(Action) Jackson"
5,Great Little Tug Boat!,"My son is 5 and he likes this tug boat quite a bit. It is rather large, but that makes it even better for little people to handle. It does have a rather realistic ""Toot!"". It is a great little Tug Boat!"
3,Very graphic,"This book would maybe be okay for a teenager. I was planning on giving it to my eight-year old and it was way too graphic and almost too much information for anybody but an adult. I liked the thorough explanation, but definitely not for a child or even some adolescents. The product was shipped quickly and in good condition, regardless of the story."
1,review,"Childhood and innocence is so very precious, I don't believe most children are ready for these graphic explanations at the age the book is intended for. I would not recommend this book. I can do a better job of explaining the beginnings of life to my daughter than the author can, and will do so when I know the time is right. I know my child best and do not need this book as an aid to parenting."
4,Really good book for kids who want to know what really happening,"I think this book is great my daughter was three when we were first expecting our second child I showed her pictures online of how big the baby was at different stages she loved seeing how the baby grew arms and changed into a real person she loved knowing what was going on I think parents should alaways review the books that there kids check out I think there is nothing graphic about the amazing way a person devolps fron two ""seeds"" If your child is not ready for this then its not the book for you my daughter is fasinated by the world and this is a great book."
4,Intimate experience of Christmas,"This DVD is the opposite of Rieu's recent ""whale of a show"" format. Here, it's just the music and the player in the quiet of a winter's night in a stable. Candlelight prevails on the Christmas trees, and several scenes where little kids are holding candles while seated on the straw. very disconcerting. Apparently they all survived. Nice to see some jazzy numbers, even a Dixieland one. A few numbers move to different locales, like church. As always, very stylish. Rieu shares spoken memories of performing in church, making decorations with his grandma, etc. If you want spectacular, get his Christmas Around the World DVD. Very long, and hits all the fabulous carols. We love them both."
2,Not like what i expected,"Overall this one is only OK, it's not what I expected. I was somewhat disappointed when first watching this one. I'm so used to the massiveness of Andre Riew on PBS or on other video (Tuscany), this one is a bit in a small scale of performance."
1,Wrong Region on the DVD,"I'm not able to play the DVD as it came in region ""5"".....that does not play in blue rays here in USA.....I don't now what to do with this product......can you help me please?"
2,Sleepy Christmas Music,It was very boring music DVD for Christmas.I like the rest of his music except this tape.We all get in sleepy while we were listing music.I don't like this DVD. But I like all the rest of Andre Rieu's DVD.
5,Andre Rieu - Christmas,"Excellent DVD - shipped in a timely manner, good quality. Would definitely recommend. Any of Andre Rieu productions are extremely well done and I believe they are always a sell out."
3,Both Sides of an Evening-The Everly Brothers,"Not a typical Everly Brothers CD. Several ""show tunes"" and songs from movies on this CD. However, I do like the song, ""Love Is Where You Find It"", a lot."
4,Delicious...but....,"This is a delicious CD instrumentally and Ewa Podles is a singing phenomenon. I have traveled far and wide groupie-like to see her in recital and I was never disappointed. But, in this work, she just doesn't sound right. Her accent is too Polish and her voice as recorded, too heavy/thick for this music..it is distracting. This piece is not her cup of tea in my opinion."
2,This tape is not the professional grade as implied.,"The product review mentions the professional and non professional grade gaffers tape. I made the mistake of assuming that because the price was so high it must be the higher grade tape. It wasn't. So I returned it. As of October 28, 2006 the product review is, in my opinion, still the same misleading text."
1,FBI Watch List,"I still enjoy showing my students how this book got me on the FBI watch list! This book has ads for other publications in the back. My favorite is ""Waging War from Canada."" CLASSIC!"
3,"slightly disappointing, slightly useful","the first 8 pages of this book are out of order, the only color photo is on the cover, and they're so dark and grainy they arent much use. there are a few drawings, it would've been much better if they had used drawings for all illustrations. or taken the photos in daylight? or used color? the written instructions are good enough, i think i can make it work."
1,Pathetic Xerox pamphlet,"I was a bit shocked to find in my package not an eight dollar book, but a 35 page leaflet. Upon opening this flyer, I discovered photography so dark and poor, it looks like it had been taken with a disposable camera in twighlight, then reproduced for this book on a worn out copier.I am returning this immidiately, and highly recommend you choose another title if you wish information on this type of endeavor.RW"
2,Hardly a book,"This book is really more of a poorly produced pamphlet. The writing is poor and the pictures are grainy and uninformative. The content isn't that bad though, although anyone who has read other works about catapults will probably be disappointed. If you want a very simple ""how-to"" this is your book. If you are looking for more substance, check out the two volume set about greek and roman siege artillery by E. W. Marsden."
1,Save your money,"There isn't much in this ""book"". They build a nice frame, but a garage door spring doesn't make for an authentic catapult. You can find better info on the web."
3,Contax SL300R vs. Contax U4R,"This is one of 2 very similar Contax models - be sure to compare before you buy! Compared to the Contax SL300R, the Contax U4R has the same body and lens, but adds: 4.2mp Sensor (instead of 3.34mp), 2 inch LCD monitor (instead of 1.5), 9 point AF, and a cradle for charging and computer/video connection with one dock. The U4R doesn't come with any SD card, but the 16mb one with the SL300R should be replaced by a bigger one right away anyway. (I won't mention prices because they might change after I post, but they are worth comparing.)This is my favorite body design, the swivel feature is more valuable than you could know until you have used one. It's a shame there is no tripod mount screw and no lens cap, but otherwise the SL300R and U4R are both great point and shoot cameras."
5,Just what I was looking for,"This drawstring backpack was exactly what I was looking for...perfect size & I like the extra zippered outside pocket...great deal, too!"
3,Backpack,Bag is useful for toting school supplies to and from school. It is not however puncture resistant. A folder punctured thin material it is made of. Will work for a short time. On a good note they are cheap enough to purchase several to get you through the school year.
5,Love it,"Material used to make this drawstring backpack looks high quality and seems to last for a long time, id deffinitley use this for pe and maybe even school. I love the zipper on this!"
3,not worth,i wouldn't buy this again it only lasted me about a month it was good for when it dint rip but it sucked because it didnt work for long
4,bag it,"It is a nice nylon bag for the price. My teenager drags it all over the place.Keep pencils, pens or scissors in pencil bag as we punctured the bag with a pencil."
3,Started to tear after a couple of weeks of use,"It looked really sturdy initially, but it started tearing after a couple of weeks. Although the material seems fine, the manufacturers were REALLY stingy when it came to stitching. The stitches are really light and spaced far apart. The only reason I'll keep it is because my mother used to be a professional seamstress and can fix this really easily. I would have preferred that the strings were a little wider (it starts to dig into your shoulders, painfully, after a while)."
2,"drawstring backpack, black w royal-from Amazon","Great price, but I was replacing a bag that my son cut a string on and I couldn't fix it. I loved it too and wanted to replace it with something similar. unfortunately, I had some reasonably heavy items in this one and now there is a small hole by the rivet that the string goes through. Also the strings are a little long-and I'm a little short. So one of the two strings on each strap seems too long and slides down my arm. I really want it to work well but so far it's fairly far from perfect. I do like that the strings go on the inside of the bag rather than the outside on the sides. And the blue is a pretty color-wish the strings matched. :)"
2,unsure.,This is supposed to one of the great Australian recordings... I don't get it... and i'm Australian. The song writing is painfully derivative and weak. The record left me more detached from Australian culture than before I listened to it. For art rock/pop its well below par.
2,Triffids booklet,"The contents were supposed to include a 64 page book. When I received the item, the book was only 30 pages. Kinda disappointing. Not real happy with the purchase."
4,The content was great,Appears to be historically accurate. I shared this book with persons that are mentioned in the book and has confirmed so. My grandfather was mentioned in it (the MacMichael farm)and regret that he died before discovering such historical book. I shall treasure it in his memory.
5,Loving Uncle,"Having received ""They Fought Alone"" as a high school graduation present(class of'67) from Uncle Wendell, and having read it many times, I realize how much of a hero he was. I married a Filipino and the book gave me many insights into the culture. If anyone wants to know what it takes to make it through a tough situation, read ""They Fought Alone"" and realize what our soldiers live with every day! The one thing I learned and continue to put to use in my life, never ask anyone to do anything that I'm not willing to do myself!! Uncle Wendell was indeed an real-life unsung hero. He will always be one of my heros!"
4,Dr. Hulq,"Hey, this a fascinating bit of history that seems to have been largely forgotten. Col. Fertig is considered the ""Father of the U S Special Forces,"" which he helped to set up at Ft Bragg after WW II. If you like ""behind the lines"" war stories, here is a real one that's hard to beat.It must have been difficult to write about the Mindanao events so long after they occurred. Keats has done a good job, but I agree the book needed more editing.I'm presenting the history of Fertig's Mindanao Guerrillas to a literary group. I have checked the facts of Keats' book against several official records and the book is reasonably accurate."
5,Peppermint,"These are the best peppermints that I have had in a long time. Some of the other brands are tasty, too, but these Spry brand help my teeth get better. I have purchased these power peppermints at several stores, however Amazon has the best prices for them that I have found. It is my plan to stick with this brand of peppermints for a long time to come."
5,great product,Very happy with the purchase. The mint flavor lasts a lot longer than the spry gum and there isn't a weird aftertaste. Will definitely buy more in the future!
5,Best Quick Remedy for Sore Throat,"Since learning about the healing properties of Xylitol, I have used these mints at the first sign of a sore throat and every time, the sore throal is gone in a short time--less than 2 hours. And I have not had a cold since."
5,Spry Mints,"Great Mints, a bit pricey but not uncommon for anything using Xylitol. They arrived on time and in great shape."
4,Xlear - SpryMints,"These are basically the same mints my dentist was recommending as being good for your teeth. They have no sugar, are refreshing and much less expensive than the dentist's mints. They also help with dry mouth."
1,Peppermint mints...,I am not overly happy about these mints. The flavor is not a favorite of mine but others in my family like them
3,it was okay not enough music,its ok but a little slow to start with maybe I thought it would be a little different. I liked the music
5,Excellent Movie!,Movie was great! Whitney Houston looked like an aging singer that had used drugs and drank hard. The exact thing she did not want for her daughters! Sparkle shined!
3,"Decent Remake, But Missed The Mark","Even with the amazing performances of Jordin Sparks, Mike Epps and the late Whitney Houston, this remake just didn't do it for me. It could have easily been a made for TV movie and will be enjoyable enough on dvd."
3,Just okay,"Not really sure why with such with such a dynamic cast this movie was just mediocre , but unfortunately it was."
3,Not what i Expected,I thought the movie was good I did not care for the ending but overall it was OK. it seems there was still more of a story to be told
3,Had its moments,"I've never seen the original Sparkle, but this remake is average. I was expecting a much more stand out performance from Whitney Houston, but she looked so old and haggard in this film it was almost a joke. She plays the part of a strict mom who practically tosses her girls out on the street. The part I didn't get is why old momma would think her daughter's lyrics are too sexual, but in the end, buys her daughter a dress with very little coverage to wear on stage.The only acting that truly stood out was that of the older sister. Her story line was really the only one of interest. I felt Sparkle's just didn't have the drama it needed. Also, I fail to believe an unknown singer like her could pack a whole auditorium of people in to see her show, so the ending wasn't that great either.Not the best movie, but not the worst. Okay if you've got nothing else to do."
3,Sparkle didn't sparkle for me,I enjoyed the first Sparkle much better. I didn't care for this one. I won't be adding this one to my video library
2,Poor Whitney....what a pathetic performance!,Jordin Sparks was amazing....but couldn't carry the movie....a decent yet redundant story line. But Whitney could barely enunciate the one or two line bits that they could give her. So sad.
1,Horrible.,"This film is a tragic mess, from the anachronistic costuming and hair to the sad, uninspired singing (including Whitney's). Nothing about it was good. I loved the original Sparkle and almost felt like this was another movie altogether. Don't waste the money."
3,Sparkle,"Not my type of movie. Acting was not very good. The plot started rather slowly, but toward the middle of the movie, it was better."
3,Sparkle,Its not Close caption couldnt understand it.thought it would be a good movie but i was wrong but thank you .
3,Not what I expected,"The cast is lovely, the story line was way off from the original movie. Just a little dry too me and I don't think I would recommend this movie to anyone but that I really liked and loved Whitney Houston this movie is definitely a keeper."
1,I couldn't watch it.,The movie kept messing up it didn't play.I'm very disappoint....I yet to see it.:( I will not oder another movie.
2,happy this was $0.99 to rent,"because if i paid any more, i would have wanted my money back. i'm extremely surprised the reviews have been mostly favorable on amazon. the only actor with some depth was sister. whitney played a convincing motherly role, though at times she could have done better. the story line was amateurish and predictable. the songs were a bore (even dream girls suffered from a predictable story line, but they made up for it with good actors (excluding beyonce) and amazing songs). given this was a musical, this should have been where this movie shined. jordin sparks gave a predictably poor lead role in this musical and her ending performance was forgettable."
3,Can't compare to original,Love the original with Irene Cara. This one pales in comparison. I just found it Okay. Jordan Sparks has no spark!
3,Pretty Good.,I enjoyed Sparkle. The only downside was Jordan Sparks as Sparkle. Mediocre acting at best on her part.The rest of the cast did great. Which made Jordan's acting even worse.
1,Disappointing..Can't compare to the Original,"I found this movie to be very boring and cheap looking. I couldn't wait to watch it, but it just fell flat. They could have picked someone who had more personality and passion than Jordan Sparks. The plot was weak and the acting wasn't the best in my opinion. Some movies can't and shouldn't be remade which is why they're called ""CLassics"". Remakes are rarely as good as the orignals..and I use ""Remake"" loosely since they changed the plot in this movie. I'm glad I didn't pay to see it. But it was nice seeing Whitney...RIP"
2,Sparkle,"Sparkle- cookie cutter story - dated boring redo of 1940s movie. Not worth the effort to sit thru...amen, acting hammy"
3,This is a Girl Flick! Not really a movie for Dudes.,"This movie is ok for those who enjoy this type of movie. For the ladies, this movie is warm, emotional, and filled with intensive drama. Great acting, beautiful sets, lighting and wardrobe. There are no real dry areas in this movie. It’s emotional and will keep the ladies interested. The music was good and fit the styling of this type of movie. As for me… I’m a dude, and quite honestly, this movie did nothing for me. I sat through it all, for my mother who wanted to see it. Lol! But those are the facts. Ladies do buy it, guys run the other way! (I gave this movie 3 stars) even though it’s not my kind of movie. In order for me to give my opinion on here, I must be (fair, balanced, and objective), to help others make an informed decision to buy this product or not. Thanks guys."
3,It was just okay.,"The original although dated, was better, the actors were good but to me it was just okay, I waited so I could download from Amazon."
3,Nothing Special,"I didn't have very high expectations, and the movie was just ok. Mike Epps' performance was the standout in the movie."
2,Movie damage.,"My movie freeze up in three section of the movie, for the purchase price with shipping and tax; I could have pruchase a new one in store."
1,"Jordin Sparks....stick to singing, not acting.","really, really bad....i would not recommend this film even if there is nothing else on. Stick to re-runs anything but this."
2,Action Scenes,I was happy to see Sister was not killed off this time.Just the action scenes were not believable to me.
3,bowe,"i have not watch the movie yet .IT""S ON BLUE RAY """" so stupid the ducomentry plays on my dvd but not the movie .ten thumps down for blue ray ''10''"
3,Not As Good as the Original Version,I thought they changed the story line a bit too much. Taking away the original story line of Sparkle made it a totally different story. They should have called it something else.
3,An okay movie,"It was a nice movie, however the transitions between the scenes were not smooth and therefore it felt as if I didn't get to see the entire movie. The actor's performances were well done."
3,Not Sparkling,"I still prefer the original SPARKLE, the story is more telling and inspiring and holds your attention throuhgout the entire movie"
2,Couldn't get Sparkle to play after paying for it.,I tried for hours to get it to play and only saw about the first 15 minutes. What a waste of $3.99.
5,"Babygirlstaa/ Very Nice Remake of the Original Movie ""SPARKLE"" Starring Irene Carra from th movie "" FAME ""","Theme somewhat different but, not to different. It's also a nice keepsake Movie if you are a "" Whitney Houston Fan"" which I happen to be. You will enjoy this movie&#128521;"
1,Terrible streaming!,The streaming was unbearable- paid for the movie so had to watch it but the quality of the presentation was just awful.This greatly took away from enjoying the movie. Sorry.
4,"Liked the movie, not good as the original","The movie is okay, not good as the original. Wish Whitney had more scenes. Sparkle(Jordin Sparks) didn't have any fire.Movie could've been better if another actress portrayed Sparkle. Jordin Sparks was quite dull."
2,If you love Houston- Don't see this one!,"Houston was supposed to be the drawing point of this movie but she couldn't carry the load this time. The plot was so-so. The setting of church-going, choir-singing sisters old enough to already be on their own sneaking out of Mama's house to sing in a nightclub so that one sister could showcase her songwriting skill was conflicting.However, the real ""dud"" point of this review is if you loved Whitney Houston, don't see this movie. It was heartbreaking to see her pittiful performance, especially in light of it being her last one."
4,Good movie but can't top the first one. The first one will always be the best.,Good movie but can't top the first one. The first one will always be the best. The best part of this movie is the person that should of died did. Not sister. She was getting ready to leave the sorry ass.
4,Movie was good and entertaining,Watched it on my kindle on an air flight. Very entertaining. Would recommend to other women. Mostly a chick flick.
3,Great Movie. The Original Still Reigns Supreme.,"There were several wonderful moments in the movie. The musical numbers were especially thrilling. But nothing and I do mean nothing can replace the original cast or movie. I'll say the same thing I told my friend when we left the theatre. ""They would have been better off giving the movie a different title..."" I love Whitney and think the rest of the new cast was great. But I don't even see this movie as a ""tribute."" It was just a rather good movie with the wrong title behind it.I recommend purchasing both the original and the remake, forming your own opinion, and developing your own appreciation for each.Enjoy."
3,Original is much better,"Different story line to the characters. Sister going to jail rather than dying different, even the songs were different would have like to see more from the original film. This wasn't a good remake in my opinion. Original was much better. I enjoyed seeing Whitney in her final film."
3,Loved Jordan Sparks,"Characters not as in depth as original, but enjoyed the fresh spin on events and new characters. Whitney was great as the mother."
3,Different from the original,"This newer version, to me, did not give the true essence as the original movie 1) Switching roles - It took the writing of songs from Stixs and gave it to Sparkle. 2) The family did not have money -- they were on the lower end of middle class.3) There was not enough emphasis dealing with sex, drugs, crime and true love commitment. 4) Why call it Sparkle if it did not go with the same story line as the original.Anyone not watching the original would find it enjoyable. I had watched the original, several times; therefore, the reason for my low rating."
4,Good Movie,"This is a well done movie. I saw and have the original Sparkle on VHS & DVD and I must say this new version is also good. Alot of original scenes changed but still the same. Good music, nice outfils. Great job done by Whitney Houston, and the entire cast."
3,just plain fair....,not as good as the orginal.the best one in the movie was Tika Sumpter. the rest of the castwas fair.
4,It was a good movie,"Pretty good movie I enjoyed the changes that were different from the original. I always hated the fact that sister dies in the original so I was happy that she didn't die in the remake and it was nice to see Whitney Houston again, since her passing."
3,Only watched it for Whitney...,"I also felt the characters did not have depth. I never saw the original, but will watch because of the other comments. In my eyes, Whitney could do no wrong...and because of this I was not looking for a powerful performance from her. However, the most powerful performance came from Carmen Ejogo! Wow! I truly believed her character's facial expressions, timing, and depth was all there. She made you feel like she lived Sistah's life and wish the entire movie was based on her instead of Sparkle. The only other believable actors were Tika Sumpter,Omari Hardwick, Curtis Armstrong and a little bit of Derek Luke. Who knows, it could have been the script or the director. Not sure; but the movie felt empty. Thankful for Carmen Ejogo and Tika Sumpter's performance or it would have really been a flop... and of course Ms. Whitney Houston!"
2,Not as good as the original,I really wasn't impressed with this movie. I didn't feel a connection between the lead characters. It was kind of dry. The movie just didn't have any passion.
5,Sparkle,This movie was beyond Excellent!!!! My family and I have watched the movie several times and everytime seems like the first time. This is a Great Movie for all to seem. It is a Must Have!!!!
4,Great singing!!,Too bad there wasn't more of Whitney singing!! Jordan Sparks at the end was outstanding!! Very impressed with her performance!
4,Great remake...,Not like the original but was still a Great Movie! Enjoyed the remix of it. Mike Epps was great in this! Enjoy!
5,Buy and watch this movie....,I loved the movie and recommend it especially since it was Whitney Houston's late movie. The supporting staff was also good.
3,Sparkle was a good movie,Not bad for the last movie of Whitney Houston. Jordan Sparks played Whitney's daughter and acted like it in reality with the voice range as Whitney's. overall it was pleasant.
3,Great soundtrack!,"Really enjoined the soundtrack of this movie, but the plot was very predictable. I give it three stars because the music was so good. It is work watching just for the musical numbers. The Acting was average, and again the plot was very predictable."
5,SPARKLE,"EVERYONE SHOULD OWN THIS MOVIE, WHITNEY WAS AT HER PEAK I AM SO GLAD I GOT THIS ONE, IT IS A VERY GOOD MOVIE AND I REALLY ENJOYED ITYES I WOULD RECOMMEND IT"
1,Sparkle,Fair. Movie was just ok. I was pretty bored with it. Streaming was terrible it kept going off and on the whole time
2,No sparkles,They really could have did a wonderful remake. They had the actors but the story did not work well and naturally like the original. When remakes are done they should improve or at least stay on the same level.
3,Just ok,"Besides it being Whitney's last movie, there was nothing really that set it apart from the original. It was just ""ok""."
5,Enjoyable!,Loved the changes from the original production and well acted! Whitney shined in this movie and will be well remembered!
4,Great adaptation of the original,"I saw the original Sparkle when it was released at the movie theather in 1976 and this adaptation is just great. Whitney Houston is supurb. Watch the original and then watch this one . The original is really , really good also, a classic."
4,Wanted more Whitney,Enjoyed the content but wanted to hear Whitney sing more. Loved to hear that woman sing. Gonna miss her for sure.
2,Dull,"This as many others before it, is not a remake but a ripoff. The best singing & acting was by the late great Whitney Houston. Jordan Spatks had little to no acting skills but she did try. Watch this only to sooth your curiosity."
1,Not what we were all looking forward to,"After watching this movie, I believe the last 25 minutes was the best part of the movie. Whitney Houston's part was short and her acting ability was poor. Sorry I paid to watch this movie!"
3,Whitney Sparkles,This is Whitney Houston's last movie/album before her death. Her role is minor and she only sings once but you will be awed at the possibility of where her career might have gone. The main story line and stars were so- so. I am a fan of Jordan Sparks but the music was disappointing. You have seen it done better before. Try Dreamgirls!
4,whitney makes this movie!,like it says in title whitney makes this movie!may she rest in peace.whitney could have more time in the movie and more singing.its too bad aaliyah passed away as well she would have been way better as sparkle than jordan sparks.thats why i didnt give it 5 stars jordan is no aaliyah.may aaliyah rest in peace as well.both aaliyah and whitney passed way too young and both have couldve have done so much more if they were still with us.
3,Sparkle,"Sparkle is not one of Whitney's better movies. Nonetheless, it was a pleasure to see her in action. I'm sure we all miss this wonderful talent. The movie itself is okay and I might rate it better if it were not that the reason we rented it was to see Whitney again. Please give the movie by itself a chance."
4,It Was Okay...,"I liked the movie; however, it was really different from the original. I really wish that it had come out right after Whitney's death. I think it would have done much better in the box office. But anyway, its a musical. Not the best, but its okay."
1,Network was down,Amazon Network was down and we kept trying over and over again but we were not able to get this movie to play past the first 15 seconds so we did not see it.
3,its ok,"i chose this rating because it was a good movie not great. i dont think it should have been a remake it should just be called another title like ""girl group"""
1,OK,I read this book and it was good. The artwork could have been better. In one illustration it looked as if one of the Twins was smoking a ciggarette instead of eatting candy as the story said. I think the author should chose a different artist to illustrate any future novels he writes. The drawings weren't very original looking. Thumbs up to the writer.
5,Awesome book,"My daughter really loved this book. She met the author and the drawer when they came to her school in May, and asked me to buy it for her. She's read it at least twice, and I have no doubt she'll read it twice more.J. Cornatzer, Mocksville, North Carolina"
3,"Fairly easy to install, lacking range","I installed this starter myself in a 2006 Hyundai Tucson. The instructions were fairly easy to follow. I found a wiring diagram on their web site for my vehicle, but it wasn't complete. I couldn't figure out the locks or headlights, so I left those disconnected. It's hard to find wiring information on my vehicle, so I don't blame their product. The range of the remote isn't as good as advertised, even with fresh batteries. That's my only disappointment and why I gave it 3 stars."
3,"Works, but would go for higher quality unit","I put one of these in my truck, and my wife's car. The remote start works, the extended range isn't close to what is advertised- even in clear unobstructed view of the vehicle.Pros-Works OK when install is completed.Timer shut off is handy.Keeping the vehicle running feature when you get out and locked is also handy.Cons-Installation is under rated. The directions are vague in some parts, additional on line searching and phone calls were needed due to mistakes and left out info in the instructions.There have been 2 or 3 malfunctions with my wife's unit that has left the car un-startable for 1/2 hour or so until the unit somehow resets.The range isn't close to advertised distance. I have to be 10 ft away, 'kind of takes the magic out of staying inside on super cold days.Bottom line- I would look for a higher quality unit. This is really one of the only units I've found that caters to ""do it your selfers"".Good luck"
4,Good,"Good anthology. Covers a lot and has helpful introductions by the editor. This is a widely acclaimed text, and a good introduction."
2,"Skip it, its just fluff","Don't waste your time or money on this one as there are far better forensic books out there. This book was just a collection of short narratives reading more like a personal diary than any kind of scientific narrative laying out the facts of cases. I guess it lives up to its subtitle of ""Life as a Forensic Anthropologist"" in that she usually presents only HER part in each case with little presentation of the entire case. The forensic cases are not really the star of this book, the author is. I was frustrated with the lack of depth. Instead, read ""The Body Farm"" by Bill Bass. Excellent storytelling there! He gives you personal stories, but also provides all the fascinating forensic info to provide a complete picture for the cases he has investigated."
5,Very stimulating reading,"At every turn, I found Mary Manhein's book very entertaining and hard to put down. The individual stories give us insight into the otherwise remote and faceless tragedies that occur daily. Perhaps the tales sans conclusion are there to show us that there isn't always a ""happily ever after"" or pot of gold at the end of every rainbow. Apparently, they are meant to be told with a human - and humorous where appropriate - touch that allows the reader to connect with each story. Manhein accomplishes her task brilliantly and succinctly. Read this book."
5,"If you like a good story, this book is for you!","Even if you don't like anthropology, you'll love this book! Mary is a wonderful storyteller, often blending humor into what would otherwise be a less than humorous situation. Having taken her anthropology class myself, I remember the stories she told during the lessons that kept us laughing!"
2,Not Enough Information,"The synopsis of this book lead me to believe this would be a book that enriched my knowledge of forensic medicine as well as tell stories. I wanted to read about Arkansas, the lore, and the cases. I wanted more information on how they reconstructed the cases. This book left me flat... She is a good storyteller, and that is all this is, stories, there isn't substance in this book... If you want a quick read this is fine, but I was wanting more from a woman of such high credentials.."
2,"too short, too basic","This book is to short. I would have assumed that it would be chop full of cases, and that was why it was so short. Wrong! If you like forensic anthropology books that deal with cases in nice greamly detail than you should stay clear of this one."
3,Interesting but incomplete,"This was an interesting book about the life of Manheim, however, I was expecting more information regarding forensic anthropology. It was very incomplete in describing the details of the forensic anthropologist, both in the tools they use and exactly what they do. I was dissapointed that there wasn't more detailed info."
3,"not bad, but it could have been great","After reading several other good books regarding this same subject (by Wecht, Snow, Ubelaker, etc.) I have to say that while I enjoyed this book, I didn't enjoy it quite as much as the others. The author has had some very interesting experiences, but they were not detailed enough in the book. I don't mean the gorey stuff of horror novels, but the intricate details of the work and subject, and the resolution to the cases. Others books have done much more with this subject. That said, I still enjoyed the author's storytelling qualities, and only wish she'd have filled out the book more. I hope she writes another book sometime, with a lot more detail and a picture of the author would be nice also!"
2,Bone Lady a good book for the general public,"Interest in Forensic science has exploded over the past few years. As a result so have books concerning the subject area. Many of the books are well and scholarly written. The Bone Lady reads well for the general public, but for thise truly interested in the field of forensic science there are a number of books that are much more informative with respect to science. For a forensic anthropology book, consider Bill Maples Dead Men Do Tell Tales. If however you are simply looking for a simple entertaining excursion into memoirs, the Bone Lady is for you."
5,Entertaining AND Intelligent,"Luckily I picked this book up on Saturday of the long Labor Day weekend because I simply could not put it down until I finished reading the last page. Mary Manhein is a such wonderful writer with lots of infomation to impart. The story of her professional life that runs through the individual case histories is interesting and inspiring - Manhein returned to college while her sons were young and changed careers to follow her inner calling. This is definitely a ""You are there!"" book. If you are at all interested in anthopology, archaeology, osteology, odontology, forensics, criminal justice, or good mysteries you will not be disappointed."
5,A wonderful introduction to forensic anthropology.,"Having known Mary Manhein when she enrolled in her very first anthropology course, I was thrilled to read her first book. She is an accomplished scholar who has excelled at her chosen profession and has now taken the time to describe, in an understandable way, just what it means to work as a forensic anthropologist.Her book is an excellent introduction, and I hope it will find its way onto the required reading list for high school and college students who want to know more about forensic anthropology. My only criticism is that I wanted to read more about the cases that she describes! I look forward to her next book, be it fiction or nonfiction, though I hope that we will hear more about her cases."
2,No there there,"I found this book quite tedious, since the author makes the fundamental mistake of thinking the subject of the book should be herself instead of her work. There is almost no information on forensic anthropology; her descriptions of cases are very short and center mainly on how she felt about them, rather than what the actual details were. From the cover and the blurbs I expected actual case histories; the book doesn't deliver. The book as written would really only be interesting to people who know the author personally."
1,This book was voted the worst book ever in my bookclub.,"I read this book with my bookclub. It sounded witty and fun. It was not. It was very boring and a big let down. Most of the stories went like this: we found a dead body, this is what we did, then we went home.My bookclub has been meeting many years. This book was voted the worst book we have read as a group. I would give it no stars if I could. Don't waste your money."
2,a lot of very short stories,"The subject is fascinating and the writing is fine. My issue with this book is that all of the stories are too short to really engage. Just as one begins to get interested, the story ends. Also, a lot of the stories don't have much content (hence, the shortness), and some don't have a resolution. The diagrams, also, could have been better and better labeled; for example, in comparing a male and female pelvis, it would be helpful if the parts mentioned in the caption were labelled on the drawing. Great subject, not great execution."
3,Not what I thought!,"I agree with the other reviewers with regard to this book. My only disappointment, and this is only a personal thing, is that is consists of a lot of short stories. I prefer texts to be written in a continuous format, but, like I say, that's just a personal thing. On the other hand, I did find it fascinating and would recommend it to others in the forensics or anthropological field. It is also very easy to read without all the unpronouncable jargon which usually accompanies books of this nature. Now that appeals to me!"
1,Getting to know the Bone Lady but forgetting about the bones,"The book was short, so it was quick reading, but I didn't learn anything about forensic anthropology. All I learned is that she had a little brother who died and how her fascination began (in forensic anthropology). It was more like a short autobiography on her versus telling about any of her cases. I was very disappointed with the lack of pictures and the lack of actual case information. Thumbs down on this one. Now Bone Voyage, there was an excellent book!"
2,Kind of interesting but definitely not Grisham best,"As usual, the legal manoeverings and the detective work are interesting, and the dialogue is vivid and at times witty. The novel is also free from the vast padding that mars some of Grisham's novels. There is also a nice surprise ending. But the plot has essential elements that are preposterously implausible and the result is just a so-so novel."
4,Helpful Supplement,"This book was useful to me in my first semester of college chemistry. It helped me to think about the concepts i learned in a way that made more sense. It is a great addition, especially if the main text is difficult to understand."
4,O Come Ye Back to Ireland,Lovely portrayal of life in Ireland at the time it was written. Characters were delightful and Irish humor and wit quite evident.
3,"Too big, but cool","This took hours for my son and his grandfather to put together and kept them quite busy. It's a cool toy, but hard to play with because it's so big. My son is eight and he found out that it fell apart to much to play with and has it stored on a shelf for decoration. If you have a child that likes to spend hours on putting together a lego set and doesn't really play with them - this is perfect. My son loved all the detail and still enjoys to look at it!!"
3,worth having if you're serious about poker,"Unlike the other reviewer, I didn't find this particularly witty or comprehensive. However, it is still a good reference book for poker players."
1,Junk,"NEVER even got to 27 psig! Supposed to go to 150 when it can't make it to 30? Already sent it back. Never had heard of Palgren before, never will buy anything by them again. Next one will be Craftsman, Hitachi, Makita, etc.Waste of time and effort. Love Amazon, but this sure left a rotten taste."
5,This topic is still current today.,I had always wondered how the causes of the Civil War had been sanitized and subjected to spin - this is thorough and authoritative. Essential reading for anyone trying to make sense of how we have arrived at today's divisive Tea Party politics!
2,History or Prejudice?,"The Myth of the Lost Cause and Civil War History provides a platform for yet another rehashing the age old thesis of Southern ""Devil Theory"" so popular in bygone decades. The simplistic outline of the history of the ""Civil War"" given in the Anatomy of the Myth should turn aside any serious reader. All Southerners were wicked, self serving, and bent on capturing the world for Slavery while the virtuous Northerners only wanted freedom for all and a National unity leading to Nirvana is simply hogwash. Read this book to satisfy curiosity but search for history elsewhere. J. Butterworth, Bristol, TN"
1,"Very, very disappointing","After reading all the essays in this work, this reader was left with one most important question: how could two writers/editors (Gallagher and Nolan) who ""supposedly"" know their subject, not once properly identify what the Lost Cause was? What IS claimed by Nolan as the ""Lost Cause"" (that the South knew from the very start of the war that they could never win, but fought the fight anyway) is so far off base that the entire excercise of this book, and the efforts of all those writing essays therein, has been consequently rendered, in this writers opinion, worthless.Why wasn't ""The Lost Cause"" the subject of this work, as the title claims? Sadly, it is clear that neither Gallagher nor Nolan (nor anyone on the editorial staff at the press for that matter) are sufficiently versed in Southern history to have either headed this effort, which if properly investigated, would have had great potential."
1,A Terrible Propaganda Piece,The shamelessly teleological approach to research displayed in this book is its most memorable feature. The ability of the authors to disregard 25 years worth of scholarship on Southern nationalism is only the most blatant methodological crime committed in what is without a doubt one of the worst examples of research I have ever encountered.
1,Northern Propaganda Hit Piece,From the first page there is an underlying hostility towards the South. It is a Northern propaganda hit piece and little more.
5,Nice,Nice handle.. looks great on my grizzle vice... Beechwood is preety light in color and I will probably stain it dark rather than wait for it to get dark from dirt
1,What a MESS!!,"We had the same experience with bedding and hamster droppings being flung everywhere and had to replace this with a wheel inside the cage which is quiet and mess free. This item is cute, but NOT worth the mess."
2,Be ready for a mess!,"Ok, this is a really innovative attachment, but I wasn't prepared for the incredible mess. Our hamster decided to haul most of her food into this ball and then started running. The result was seeds and feces scattered about 2.5 feet from this wheel! I couldn't get her to stop so we had to abort this thing."
2,bigmess,"well, i bought it and my hamster decided to bring in his food and everything else he could find mouthful buy mouthful, sleep in it, then start running through the junk. i keep cleaning it all out and keeping it clear but then he does it again. do not buy if you dont want to throw out pounds of hamster food. Even though its amusing.not worth the clean up"
4,When No One Was Looking,"This book is about Kathy Bardy. She is a tennis player, and dreams of bering famous someday. At her level tennis isn't fun, it's competition! Suddenly a terrible accident happens, and by coincidence, it involves a tennis apponent that Kathy can't beat. This book is about Kathy's tennis career and an accident that can ruin it all."
5,great for homeschooling,"We purchased this book for our math curriculum this fall. It has a lot of hands on math, and looks like a lot of fun. There are also black line masters to duplicate for worksheets. The instructions could be a bit better, a bit more organized, but in general it looks like a good book and we are looking forward to using it."
5,Perfect summer day music Booty's will shake,I loved this disc.....a wonderful collection of Palmer's Island sounding music. For the musicaly inclined Lots of polyrythms This disc always makes me smile. Quite possibly the most eloquently produced album I have ever listened to. Over and over....Don't miss this !!! bc
5,Outstanding Example of Robert Palmers Best Work !,"I was never a big fan of Robert Palmer's rock and roll stuff. However, I am the BIGGEST fan of his ""tropical music"" and his older stuff. In my opinion, ""Some People Can Do What They Like"" is one of the best recordings I've heard. ""Woke up Laughing"", (the song), is a masterpiece, and the rest of the CD is as well. I've always appreciated unusual percussion and a tropical flair (without the hokiness that you sometimes get). This C-D arrived on a Friday night and I sat down and listened to it .... then I listened to it again. Incredible."
5,Wish I bought it sooner,"I have had this toaster oven a few months now and still love it! It's larger than most. I have teens who frequently would heat up the whole oven for a frozen pizza or other small item,and now they prefer the toaster oven. Also, I buy cookie dough and they will bake up a small sheet in 10 minutes and it does a perfect job. It's a big hit. We don't use it for toasting, but for a couple slices of garlic bread, it also does well."
3,Less than adequate,"We chose this oven based on the positive reviews by former buyers. We found that to name it a toaster oven is misleading as the toaster really is inadequate. Only part of the toast begins to toast on a regular basis so we dug out the old toaster and gave up on the Hamilton Beach ""Toaster"". So the toaster part gets a 1 and the oven a 7 out of 10."
3,Not as great as I hoped,"it's ok, shouldn't expect much being so cheap I guess. Toaster isn't that great. Would I buy this again, don't think so."
3,Toaster Oven,"Nice, but item is really bigger than we wanted. Amazon was most gracious accepting return."
3,"Ok, but uneven","It's ok, but toast comes out uneven. They recommend you put the rack towards the top. Who wants to keep moving the rack from one place to another, for toasting vs. baking? Takes up to 5 min's for toast, and that seems way slow if you're in a rush. Also, I have a problem with these dial-type toasters - Instead of setting the darkness then pushing down, as toasters have done since the Stone Age, now you have to dial to the darkness you want then suffer the annoying clicking of the timer. AND, come to think of it, you have to set it to ""toast"" in 2 different places. Dopey. And don't think you can really put 6 slices of bread in there. They'd have to be real-small slices. I do like the easily-removable crumb tray."
4,good basic toaster oven,"I purchased this toaster oven for the occasional broiled cheese sandwich or to broil a single serving of meat or fish. Also to warm pizza or small appetisers I want crispy but don't want to turn on the large oven broiler. I did not want to bake pies or make toast...the oven and toaster are best for that. I wanted a small but not tiny oven that wouldn't catch fire or start smoking(read some of the other reviews and check out consumer recalls). And I didn't want to spend much on an occasional use item. This product fits my above requirements and it's an excellent value for the price. Like all toaster ovens it takes a while to heat up. Hope this helps you make your decision. Anita, Palos Verdes, CA"
2,You get what you pay for.,"I had a Delonghi Toaster Oven for many years, and used it constantly. When it finally stopped working I read the reviews and thought I should try a different brand. Big mistake. The Hamilton Beach is priced right, but it doesn't do most of what a toaster oven should do.First, if you just want a small oven to bake or broil, this works just fine, as long as you read the directions and understand how the on and off dial works. The only negative about the oven part is that the tray that comes with it warps when it gets hot. It shouldn't do that.As a toaster, this hardly works at all. Unlike my prior toaster oven, this is designed so the bottom elements heat up before the top ones. That means bagles need to go cut side down, so it is hard to know when they are done. I have learned that when the edge starts to burn, the middle will be almost lightly done. In addition, because the top turns on later, melted cheese on toast is quite difficult to make."
5,THE BOOK COVER AND STORY GO HAND TO HAND.. I LOVE IT,"After reading How To Interview A Sleeping Man, it brought back childhood memories of how I use to love hearing stories from my grandmother Carrie and I reminisce about how she looked with her two platts on her head and beautiful light brown skin tone that look so beautiful on the back porch just as the sun going down telling us stories about our family history ..........Thanks Milli"
4,A Poppy Spacey Remodel,"Sure this isn't the old Hopesfall, but changes occur when a majority of the members change. I personally love every Hopesfall cd I have heard. A-Types is no different."
1,GD Shame,"I'm not sure there's anything more that I can say that hasn't already been said about this album. It marks an incredible de-evolution of a band I was genuinely excited about. I wish I'd read these reviews first rather than gleefully picking up the cd at a store. What was once a band with intensity, songwriting ability, and keen artistic vision is now a bland, role playing, emo cliche. A couple of these songs bear some merit, but for the most part they are nothing you haven't heard before from less talented, more mainstream bands. They certainly didn't pull off the change from heavy to melodic with the grace of a band like Underoath, whose metamorphosis from death metal to screamo was both interesting and shocking. It's hard to understand exactly how this happened, considering the amazing growth shown on Hopesfall's previous releases. They were on the path to greatness, but they took the low road to mainstream acceptance instead. Here's to hoping that someday they get back on track."
3,I have 6 words for HOPESFALL.....,"YOU SHOULD HAVE CHANGED YOUR NAME!Reason #1) Now that the drummer Adam has left (which is a total surprise), there is only one original member left which is Josh the guitarist. Pretty good reason to change your name I think.Reason #2) If you're going to change your sound so drastically so you sound nothing like you used to.In all honesty, this is a somewhat decent album for a ""Rock"" band. The seven minute epics are gone, The screaming is gone. The best track is OWL only because it's basically HUM's ""Boy with stick"" on 45 rpm.Welcome to mediocrity."
2,An Unfortunate Turn Of Events,I don't understand those who can listen to this release and call it 'good' or even 'palatable' when compared with their older material. 'The Satellite Years' was quite a sad departure in itself from the near-perfection that was the 'No Wings to Speak Of' EP. The magic has gone and has been replaced by mediocrity.Pick up 'No Wings To Speak Of' and thank me later.
2,big change,"this album is actaully disapointing, the drums suck and the song structures are a-typical, verse chorus verse chorus bridge chorus, what happened? they shouldve changed their name, totatlly diff band. i mean if this was another band it would be pretty goood, but hopesfall has too much goin for them, they skrewed up on this one if u ask me, solid album but repetitive and boring"
1,get ready for disappointment,"wow...all I have to say is wow...what an utter disappointment...I love No Wings to Speak of...I'd even put it in my top ten hardcore albums, I liked the direction of Satalite Years...I love advancement musically, cave-in's jupiter is one of my favorite albums, I love codeseven, and I also like both of their old acts....but this one? I have never heard a more boring, generic, wannabe Midtown sell-out...It's cool if you wanna sing, but please bring the good music with you...the new drummer is even worse than hoobastanks, there are very few ""vintage"" hopesfall guitar riffs, and vocally, this guy sucks as much as James Hart does as a singer. If you like Hoobastank or Midtown, buy this album, but if you liked hopesfall, be prepared for disappointment..."
1,A Huge Letdown,This CD sucks. Even the title is gay. Listen to Endeavor on the Frailty of Words. It is by far their best song and CD.
3,breathtaking ?,"my breathing actually got faster from frustration when i first heard the new record. This is not (satellite years) hopesfall. Adam decided he wanted to sing....and he created a types. It is actually very deceiving because hopesfall is dead. The new band , hopesfall, though is pretty good. Icarus ,the heaviest song on the album and first single, is an amazing song. The rest is very melodic and you can still recognize the members of hopesfall jr. playing to adam vocal. It is breathtaking but not in the way you expected it, just sit down, drink a glass of water and listen to the new incredible hopesfall album."
2,.hopesfall. are now HOPE3FALL,"This is the sort of album that all the Kerrang kids will go mad for. Gone is the awesome drumming, the breakdowns and the creativity. It's not a terrible album for what it is but I don't know, it seems that now they sound just like everyone else.I suggest you check out 'No Wings To Speak Of' or the hard to find `Frailty Of Words' Both are stunning! Even their last album showed a promising direction that will now never happen sadly. As for A-Types, I'm in no doubt of the inevitable layer of dust that will eventually grace its CD case in the coming months and years. Come back .hopesfall. !!!! Change is not good!"
3,not suprising,"its not suprising that ppl would not like this cd.hopesfall kind of changed up abit with this cd. it sounds more like some of the crap on the radio tight now but i personally think that this cd rised above all those clones on the radio. If you think about it, this cd could have been like satellite years,the riffs are heavy enough, but the vocals are sung more than screamed like on satellite years where its the other way around. the cd is quite beautifully written. alot of the songs sound great.The reason why im not so upset id because i like all kinds of rock, not just hardcore, but why i give it 3 is because when you( as a band) start out with a certain sound and you are loved for it, and you turn around on your next cd, and change your sound, you will lose alot of fans. If you like Hopesfall's ""The Satellite years"", you might want to avoid this cd, if your open minded with music, than give it a shot, its not that bad."
3,Hmmmm...,"I honestly think that this band should have kept their hardcore roots. The Satelite years was an amazing cd. A Types isnt Hopesfall, it's a new band. They should of renamed their band. It's kinda sad and all but the new band aint all that bad. They have a few good songs. ""The ones"" its catchy. I wouldnt call this new album a waste of music. I do sense a more metalish sound though. I dont know, you gotta judge for yourself. It aint all the bad."
1,"Excuse me, is this The Used?","I used to really like Hopesfall. I found Satellite Years to be a very great atmospheric/hardcore/whatever album. No Wings To Speak Of was also another great release by them...but what in the WORLD is this? Seriously...anyone who thinks this is ""evolving"" is crazy. It's called dumbing it down for the commercial masses. Every song on this honestly sounds the same. Whereas, on previous albums you had songs like ""The Bending"" and ""End Of An Era"" that would twist and turn several times and honestly felt like rollercoaster rides, every song on A Types has verse/chorus/verse/chorus and that's all fine and good, if it were another band other than Hopesfall! A Types stands for everything Hopesfall USED to NOT stand for. I cannot recommend and/or support this blatantly obvious attempt to appeal to all 14 year olds."
2,hopes fall and die with this cd!!!!,What is up with every other trustkill band going soft. after i listen to this cd i fell the instant erge to listen to something extremly brutal just to equal me out so i dont shoot myself.Other than that i think the music is grand but the singin is a big disappointment and so is probaly the rest of hopesfall's future in the hardcore scene.
2,Listening to this is hard,"I have to say, ""No Wings.."" and ""Satellite"" are the kind of records where every song takes you on this journey into yourself and makes you just want to scream out loud because they convey their passions in the music so well. But, I pre-ordered this cd and it is appropriately title...""A-Types"". They have tried to be on par with all the other type A personalities in the mainstream music scene and no matter which way you cut it...THIS IS NOT HOPESFALL."
2,Future hopes have fallen,"So its Tuesday morning and i wake up to go to class. all class i cant wait to get the new .hopesfall. cd! I run to HMV after class and pick it up for 15.99 CAN which is a reasonable price. Now i have to wait to get home befor i can listen to it because all i have on me is my ipod. An hour of exicitement later i pop it in my cd player to learn that this is not what i thought it was. Now i knew that it was going to be less screaming and more of a suttle album because i had seen them in concert about 2 months ago. This though was not hat i expected. This whole cd has less than half the ammout of screaming of one song off any of their other cds! I was obsessed with hopesfall, now im dissapointed. This is an alright album as it is, but as a hopesfall album its garbage!"
1,HopesFELL,I will echo the frustration with some of the other reviewers here. I myself have been a rabid .hopesfall. fan since the EP was first released on Trustkill.Imagine my surprise when I hear this new disc that reminds me more of Hoobastank or Incubus than anything.Typically mainstream bands mimic a watered-down version of hardcore ...but this sounds like HopesFELL is trying to mimic the watered-down versions of themselves.
2,Generic at best.,"Satellite years was one of my favorite cds, with a-types i just dont know what happened. Change is one thing but this is very commercial, very generic sounding radio rock. The clean vocals dont even sound nearly as good as they used to, they now have the wimpy 9 year old boy vocals.Theres still occasionly some good guitar playing, but its so few and far between that it doesnt save this album. I dont know why so many bands think thatplaying radio rock is ""maturing"", yet so many bands switch to this style. Funny to because every band doining it thinks there the only one doing it.(...)"
2,.hopesfall.,"this album is so depressing.i fell in love with hopesfall, and now i want to kill myself because of how much of a change this is. i give them credit, it's a good album... but not even in the same genre as the other album i considered so close to perfection."
2,A departure to say the least.,"Call it sentimentality or what you like, but it kills me that Hopesfall made two of the best hardcore records that I've ever heard (The Frailty of Words and No Wings to Speak of) with mostly the same line-up...but didn't continue. Josh and Doug left. From the little I've heard of The Satellite Years, it's good...but A Types just departs so much. While I'll never knock a band for making the music they want to make, I can say that I just can't get into this one.Several years ago, I remember seeing these guys in a house show with Dashboard Confessional. That was a great show."
1,CACA anyone?,"Do not buy this album, its unoriginal and boring. Hopesfall used to be something special, now I find them reminiscient of all the so many bands I see on MTV who sell out to play big shows with Good Charlotte. This album blows, go pick up ""Satellite Years"" or ""No Wings to Speak Of"", and to the kid rambling about ""cookie monster vocals"".... umm.... shut up."
1,The Satellite Years are over.,"I bought this cd without hearing ANY of the songs first... I was absolutely positive that it would be amazing because hell ""it's hopesfall"" I said. I was wrong. Hopesfall has created music so boring that perhaps they should go tour with Staind and Trapt. Then I realized they changed out 3 of their members... I think it's time Hopesfall stopped discracing their old self and made a NEW NAME for their band... This is the worst cd I bought all year."
1,...it's impossible to tell how much this sucks!,"What the hell is going on with all these bands?!!And please don't even try to tell my that they have aquired maturity or that they have evolved...this is the same f***ing story with all the bands like Alexisonfire, underoath and so much others...damn! Hopesfall WAS so original!so good musical execution, sensefull lyrics, good screamer(did he's loosing it's voice???)...it's not the worst album ever made, but it's some kind of déja-entendu...hardcore music is dying everyone...blame Atreyu and all these fashion emoboys-girls for what happened...going to listen to refused and dillinger escape plan... it gonna stop me to be so sick..."
2,Hmmm...,"Disappointing...It's a good album in its own right, but it's not anything near what i would expect from the Hopesfall i knew previously. It has several good songs, and nothing is particularly awful about it, it is just so mediocre and samey and just not the kind of development or even same level of music as i hoped these guys would produce with their new album. If you're a hopesfall fan thinking of buying it and hoping for something as exciting, unique and downright interesting as The Satellite Years i wouldn't bother."
3,its still hopesfall,"when i got this cd, i had heard previously that it wasn't as good, but i thought i'd try it out, of course i couldn't find it ANYWHERE!!! all the stores in town here didn't release it when it was supose to be released. [...]. at any rate it still is hopesfall. its not my favorite record, BUT i do respect that they wanted to go this route, still a favorite band despite a ""pussier""/""popier"" album..anyways i read an article about them, and they said they're fans would understand...who knows what the future will hold for hopesfall, more of this or more older stuff, or better yet, improvement!!! hopesfall is a blessing to my ears and this album deserves to go up front in my cd collection :Dif your new to hopesfall, and want to hear an amazing album get satellite years, no wings to speak of, and frailty of words, those albums are by far better in my oppinion.."
3,A fresh new feel....,"Every now and then bands grow up a little and try something new. Hopesfall has not fallen short of their metal and hardcore roots, however they have completely revamped their sound in ""A Types"". Expect heavier catchier rock riffs and more melodic singing. Screaming and breakdowns are still evident but not as much as compared to that of ""Satellite Years"". Seemingly to go for a more radio friendly approach, Hopesfall still doesn't disappoint. Non-fans of hardcore can enjoy this album thoroughly."
2,The Definition of Sell-Out,"This album is WHAT NOT TO DO if you weant to maintain any sense of credibility after the amazing ""Satellite Years"". Generic riffs, tradtional song structures, and little to no screaming make Hopesfall the latest promising band to sellout for more airplay. They need to change their name seeing as 3/5ths of their members are differnet from the previous album. Now they write pop tunes where they used to write engaging space rock."
1,The Book By Rajeev Sharma,"This book is very biased. I think that buying this book well be just a waste of money. This book is very good for the Nationalist Indians, because what this book describe is what their wish is, their dream, but the whole world knows the truth. 850,000 Indians troops against 600 Mujahideens. It was the USA pressure that made Pakistan withdraw the Mujahideens from Kashmir, not the feminent Indian soldiers. Let's not deny the facts."
1,Facts or fiction?,"I am very disappointed with this highly distorted, untrue and twisted book by Ranjeev Sherma. It wouldnt hurt to put some truth behind his claims. Author is more interested in blaming ISI for India's ills and cover up rapes and killings by the Indian army."
1,Hysterical Delusions,This book is not very fact-based nor is it objective. It merely bases its assumptions on a bunch of hear-says. Not recommended!
5,Old Friend Revisited,"This is a fine Everly Brothers album, and it's good to see that the cover is the same as the original album I had purchased, lo these many years ago. Don and Phil's voices have deepened a bit, moving towards their peak sound achieved in the classic ""Sleepless Nights."" Oh Cathy! How could I be your clown!"
5,Stunning,"I ordered this for the PC (directly from the UK) but nothing changed between the PC or Xbox version. The graphics are awsome, music and sound are nothing short of amazing. I call this an ""Unlocked"" type flight game sine you are actually able to fly stright up and flip over in a loop and barrel roll. The music is queued up like a movie, so, for example, when your in Bitterfield (supposedly what became of Russia cus everythings in russian) its dark and suspenseful, but when you turn the corner and have a dozen sentry guns firing on you it cuts in a great guitar solo. If you judge a game purely by how big it is, the stats are:Game data: 1.50 GbMusic: 2.06 GbVideos: 1.71 GbBottom line: THQ really put alot of effort into this game, really simplified it is a fight of free market Proteus (english) vs militarism DST (german) with the FTZ (nutral) caught in the middle.Graphics: 10/10Music:10/10Sound:10/10Gameplay:10/10Replay Value: 15/10Overall: 10+"
4,"Completely Overlooked, Underrated, and Fun","Yager is fun and satisfying. Fans of the Star Wars: Rouge Squadron games will be especially pleased with the gameplay because it is almost exactly the same. Graphically, it holds up, even compared to some Xbox 360 games. It would be nice if more games today had such interesting stories.The similarities with Crimson Sky are due to the fact that both are flying games and both are in the steampunk genre, but that is where the similarities end. Crimson Sky was designed for multiplayer gaming, and Yager is a better 1-player game."
1,NOT WHAT IT SHOWS,THIS IS ONLY 2 PODS AND HOLDERS! NOT A HOPPER! CHANGE THE PICTURE AND IT IS NOT VEIW LOADER IS IS JT!
1,"Be WARNED, the Item in the picture is NOT what you wll recieve","The hopper in the picture does NOT have anything to do with the ""VL Ball Hauler with belt and plug holder."" i saw how it said $9.99 for a hopper, and eligible for my prime?? i was very excited until i realized this...im not bashing the product that you will recieve, but if you are only here because of the low price you saw for the ""hopper"" look elsewhere."
5,Great find!,"This was a wonderful find. I learned of this faucet as part of a matching collection at the home store, but no one had the faucet in stock. I was pleasantly surprised to find it on line and at about half the price! Delivery came quickly and just in time for my new vanity installation."
1,One Trick Pony,"It is just fine to have an introduction to Buddhism but this book is not that.If you believe your life is a train wreck because your religion, your family, your school, your society and your friends have forced you to repress your feelings then you may find this book to be your holy book since about the only answer to every question is to realize you are repressed and don't be. This is not inspiring, it is simplistic and repetitive.If you are interested in emotional wellness there are so many other books that are easy to read but contain real content, two are: The Happiness Trap, and Zen Heart. Either of these runs circles around Emotional Wellness.P.S.The dust jacket is very pretty. That is one plus."
3,Emotional Wellness,Received the book quickly. Thanks Very much! Book quality is good. I haven't read the book yet. Its my next one.
2,"This Book Is Not Even Written By OSHO, Prove It To Yourself Within 10 Seconds!","I own this book, have read almost the whole thing. First of all (and why am I the only person going to point this out to you?)this book is not written by OSHO. His name is own it, but that is all. Do a simple search on the net ""when did OSHO die"", you'll see that it was on January 19, 1990. Yet, this was published and copyrighted in 2007. This is a ghost written book by the his organization. What can you say about a book that starts out with a huge lie?This book has a meandering quality about it and I resent many of the things I've read. One of them is that marriage is slavery for women and should be eliminated. Maybe for him, not me."
2,Didn't connect with it...,"I picked up this book and plan to return it today. I'm not saying its a bad book, I just did not make a strong enough connection with it to hold onto it. Osho says some insightful things, but some of them I have already experienced myself. I did not like his approach, he uses some sarcasm here and there and is constantly telling you what you ""SHOULD"" be doing. Many spiritual books I find are packed with contradictions and hipocracy, but not so much this one. Maybe I'm just not ready for this book yet? I'll revisit it down the road, but for now it's back on the shelf. I would recommend the Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle instead. Thanks for viewing!"
2,Ramble on....,"It sounded good. And I could relate to parts of it, as a recent transplant to Denver and having just experienced the deaths of close relatives. But the pomposity was too much. Some interesting stuff, but a lot of disorganized rambling. It feels like Gessner is just trying too hard to write the book he wants to be so proud of. The word ""narcissistic"" pops up a lot in the book. Totally appropriately. Does the guy mention beer in every single essay in the book? Yes, David, you're cool - you carried beer along on your hike."
2,Just not fast enough for snap shots,"I love it's small size (easy to pocket), decent looks (it's a camera after all), outdoor picture quality (could be better indoors) and of course the wifi feature (easy to use, IF you have WinXP!).If you like to take spur of the moment shots though, this camera is just not up to snuff, especially indoors. It just takes too long to boot up and focus. Between photos there is a good 2 second lag, at least. Not good if you like to take photos of your kids in an ""oh so cute"" action situation. That's exactly what most people use consumer cameras for and this subpar performance is just not acceptable. If that includes you, look elsewhere and consider a lower resolution camera and forget about the wifi for now.If it weren't for that, the camera would get an easy 4, if not 5 stars from me."
2,Look at the New List price from Nikon.,The old list price will never go back. Amazon says (40%)off the exploded old list price. This camera is getting mixed reviews. A lower price would help the likability of this camera.It's WI-FI feature is not so great..look at the Canon SD430 at what it can do. Video only uses the digital zoom of 2x and makes .MOV files which are Apple software files and very large file size with HQ video. The LCD is cluttered with all the different settings available. Read the manual on Nikons website to see what the camera can do. Worth $260- $290 that's why it gets a 2 star. The camear does have several quick shot modes to take several pitures at a time.
4,Great Indoor / Outdoor Camera,"I bought this camera a month back. Still taking some snaps every day. It works well for indoor shots too. I tried so many digicams. Most of them delivered very good quality shots outdoor, but indoor shots were grainy. But not this one. It's so compact to carry around. But need to be careful with kids around. Wi-Fi is easy to setup. But i don't see much of use for it. It can't work with any PC OR Network. Real use would be, go to friends place take snaps download wirelessly to friends computer. But it needs a software setup in each computer. Latest laptops have memory card readers, so thats much faster than Wi-Fi transfer and Wi-Fi transfer also drains your battery soon."
2,What's that black spot?,"Now I'm no jeweler, but I have bought my partner a few diamonds over time. And I know a little about the C's of a diamond. And if I am reading correctly your not supposed to be able to see imperfections in these without magnification. There is a spot in one of the ones that ordered that can be see while wearing them. I think the ratings on these are skewed a little. Not as high quality as they are listed to be."
2,Color not what I expected,"I was extremely disappointed in the color of the diamonds. There was a very distinct yellow color, not the ""near colorless"" I expected from an I-J diamond. As mentioned in other reviews, they are pretty lackluster. The good part is that they were very inexpensive so I didn't waste too much money. I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Not what I was expecting,"I received a few great buys from Amazon on jewelry, but these earrings didn't measure up to what I was expecting. The best way to describe the earrings I received is that they are dull. There is no glimmer in them whatsoever. Being fairly inexpensive, I thought they'd at least have a little life in them, but they don't. I'd have been better off with CZs."
4,Pretty little diamonds,I bought these for my daughter to replace a pair she had lost. The price was good and the earrings are beautiful on her ears.
1,Not recommend to buy,"1.The errings looks good. the stone is shining.2.However, the pierce can't be fixed well on the ear, and may fall or lost the earring. Can't used in for about one month."
1,"Bad buy, treated diamonds??? I2 or worse?","These diamonds are at the bottom of the barrel as far as quality, clarity, cut and so on. Enter the statement may have been treated and they are a bad buy all around. I would feel terrible knowing I bought a diamond that may fall apart on my girlfriend when she cleans them, or if they lose their sparkle due to any coatings, laser drillings that may fall out over time. Do your homework and buy a book ""How to buy a diamond"". You will not regret what you learn about your next purchase on a quality diamond. Insist on non treated stones. They are a worthwhile investment for you or your loved one."
4,Nice,"They arived today, nice size not too big or tiny, the white gold setting makes it more distinguish. Good purchase"
1,Not in stock,Before ordering this item check with northern Tool on availablity! Waited 2 weeks only to find out they never had it in the first place! Could have had it by now from another supplier.
2,Disappointed,I was very disappointed in this video. The title was miss leading as it was about what not to do with powerpoint. It would have been more useful to me to actually see some examples of successful techniques.
3,Text good. Speaker on cd has poor pronunciation.,"I'm fine with the ecclesiastical pronunciation in Latin -- it's perfectly valid -- but when the speaker sounds completely American and doesn't attempt to make the vowels more latinate and clean, well, that's bad. They could have found a couple thousand folks with better ecclesiastical Latin than this. Yikes."
1,Latin workbook,There was no indication that this book would be half written in! A good half of the book has the pages completely filled out and I am going to have to spend a lot of time going through it to erase everything.
4,Better than I suspected.,"This game is a lot of fun to play. It could be better(more options like GTA), but fun enough that I keep playing it over & over."
2,Fair Review,"I had this game before on the PS2 and it worked well some when, I heard the PS3 had God father (The Don Edition) I was excited. I have all platforms & consider myself a decent judge of games the PS3 version tried to hard to improve on great game if you have to a play God Father version play the PS2 or Xbox & Wii version better feel for the game then the PS3."
1,SUCKS,this game did not match the description from website it had scratches all over and does not play fine
4,"A really good game, just a little repeating...","Now, The Godfather - The Dons edition really is a wonderful game.It have great graphics, a long playtime (15hours+), nice missions, great weapons and a huge map.People who liked the GTA series would probably like The Godfather, since many ofthe features are the same. You can walk anywhere you want on the map, walk insidebuildings whenever you want (a lot more than in GTA) and you can do whatever you want to.The bad part thought, there's always one, is that the game is a little to repeating after havingplayed it for hours, businesses have to be taken over, again, and again, and again (there is over 50of them so think about it) and you have to talk to the same people for the 20th time or kill the 10000thmafia mob.But overall, the good things make up for the repeating in the game. Try it, it's worth it."
1,"Can you say ""Stupid""","This was a lame novel. It's an extremely true story about how the white man took over and surpressed Native American culture, but this storie could've taken a much higher route. There are several sections of betrayl and about 15 pages on chilli beans! Even reading the cliff's notes were boring. Please spare yourself, or the person you are considering bying this for and DONT MAKE THEM READ THIS!"
2,"Some good action, good writing, but insipid by the end","The books sets up a lot of intriguing conflicts, and it brings the era and the area to life for the reader. Borland describes a real tragedy: ripping the culture away from an entire nation of people and forcing them to be either betrayers of their culture or outcasts. But by the end, an incredibly complex man is reduced to solving his problems by narcissism, really. Unconvincing, and a little too macho. Sort of feels like a 70's novel. Would not recommend it for young adults, but would not object to it either."
1,Litarary Analisis of When the legends die,"This is the story of a boy surviving in the mounatians. Surviving alone after his parents die he is forced to live off the land with his brother {the author uses good literary devices and sense of atmoshere the mountain is the main setting in the story also his best chanse for survival during the harsh winter weather and long hot summer ""he came hurring through the alley,"" quotes borland to give a sense of imagrey as the story progreses further borland uses other devices such as magic three whenhe says ""he was terrified, frightened, scaredof the storm. To describe and give a sense of belonging he says ""as the storm began to grow the wind howled an trees creaked as borland uses a variety of words."
3,When the legends never die,This book is ok but I think It could be better then it is. If I was the arthur I would write it better than it is. The book has a great climax in the middle. It goes up and down. Thanks for reading my review.
4,"Powerful, honest, and provocative. It will challenge you.","When the Legends Die is a compelling novel about the struggle of a Native American in a white man's world. Thomas Black Bull searches for his identity and place in life through many hardships and disappointments. Effective for young adult readers, the novel brings up questions about culture, identity, and tradition vs. change. The book is both provocative and easy to read at the same time. I definitely recommend this novel to all ages, but especially high school age students. It challenges one's beliefs and ideas about culture and ""living."""
1,"WARNING, WARNING, poor style, ick.","I really couldn't stand this book. Its a reading level four (it says so in the book) which is a little over estimated for a book that has sentences like ""And then they went to the happy place and danced the happy dances"" and ""he sang of the roundness, the roundness of the trees, the earth, ect."" not exact quotes but close enough.I had to read it for a class and wound up just asking other people what happened in the end because I just couln't read through it. The story line was okay but the style, well I think the author just took notes from old 50's westerns and other movies with native americans in them from that time period. Too many stereotypes to count. Yick. Do yourself a favor and avoid this book."
2,"I read this for Honors English, not challenging though!","This book was okay in the beginning, but it slowly got worse and worse. I'm glad I didn't buy this book, because it wasn't worth the money. The story itself is pretty boring. The other literary elements were poorly done. The book offered no masterful symbolism or depth of any kind. I was really disappointed, because it didn't strech my mind. I think reading this book is a waste of time unless you really like Native Americans or the rodeo, because this book is not very good in a literary view point."
1,When the Plotlines Die,"Well for all you people out there that enjoy books about nature and young boys trying to find themself in a world unknown to them, try My Side of the Mountain. For all you people that enjoy books about nature and young boys trying to find themself in a world unknown to them, but in a mediocre fashion, try When the Legends Die. The story is pretty much a reverse of My Side of the Mountain, only instead of living in the wilderness, the protagonist, Tom ""shallow character"" Black Bull, is living in a world of ""rodeo'in"". The plotline is weak at best, and often involves conflicts that make the soap opera ""Passions"" look like Charles Dickens. Also many of the characters are just bland rip offs of the last person to harrass Tom. I would pass on this book if you are looking for a nature story. If you want that stick with the classics. If your forced into reading this How Boredland ""classic"" then best of luck to you. Try not to fall asleep too quickly, you still have to pass english."
1,"Unlike any other-full of sadness,joy,humor, & disappointment","The book is well-written and reading it is easy. This book is one of those books that seem to never end. The author provides too much unnecessary details that by the time he gets to his point the reader is no longer interested in what the author has to say (or falls asleep before he or she even finishes reading it). I do not recommend this book to anyone, unless one is interested in similar types of stories."
1,What a waste of time ! !,"This has to be one of the worst books I've read in recent memory. Borland did not do a good job presenting his character and getting the reader's attention and compassion. Frankly, I found Tom bitter and insensitive. This is another ""victim"" book that seemed to drag on forever. The best part of this book for me was finishing it. I got to hand it to him to for recovering (not to give anything away) but do we really need a hundred pages on it. If your searching for a Native American novel, search somewhere else."
1,Shara thinks this book TRIED too hard to be deep,"Hal Borland uses references to the ""roundness of life"" and ""the old ways"" in an attempt to bring depth to Tom Black Bull's character. The disagreeable style overshadows any hope of getting any deep meaning from the story. Tom starts out in the wilderness living in the old Ute way with a bear for a best friend. He spends the middle of his life killing broncs that represent the evils of his past, and ends up returning to the mountains to live in the old way again. This is the essence of the story. Tom's life is anything but exciting or deep. Unless you want to read a book filled with Disney-style-Indian sentence sructure that leaves you wondering why you wasted your time waiting for something worth while to happen, I would not recommend this book."
2,Sara AnneMarie Shepard: Read this book if you have patience,"In my opinion, this book was extremely easy to read. At some points in the book it was hard to stay focused because it was so easy to read. I suppose the theme was the only thing keeping my going. Acceptance is a huge part of everyday life; therefore, I was interested in finding out how the characters handled it. Accepting everyone is critical to me. Personally I was a little disappointed that everyone was not accepted in this book. This book is about an Indian family who goes back to their homeland and lives by thier old ways. When his parents die, he is forced to go back to the city and live the modern way. He is not accepted in his school, which really upsets me because just because of his culture and beliefs he is ridiculed. He finds a job as a bronc rider and in the end of the book he returns home. He realizes that his homeland is where he really belongs. I recommend this book if you have a lot of patience and time."
2,"I, Larissa, feel that this book was a disappointment.","This book, When The Legends Die by Hal Borland, is about a Native American boy who has to survive in a white society. He has many hardships to overcome, including both of his parents' dealths. He has to deal with other peoples' opinions while he is in a white school. Having to learn English, alone, is a big step in the life of a child. I actually felt that this book was a little boring. It was hard for me to read because i could not get into it. It is an easy book to read, but because the plot is so drawn out, it makes the book a little dull. The style of the book is good, though. I would recommend this book to a person that enjoys ""Cowboys and Indians"" types of books."
3,About Whern the legends dies,I had to do a group english project on this book and we found it to be average. The plot and charatcers make it a great book to read if yor into Indian Civilization. But I really don't think it would catch the attention of teenagers today when it did in the early sixies when it was published. Since the book has like four huge chapters its really hard to follow the scenery because of its length and complex plot. So I think its okay but just not all that great
3,The circle of life...,"This was an easy read novel. It had a great theme about the ""roundness"" of life. The romantic, realistic, and stereotypical views of Indians were all well portrayed."
3,Indian Traditions Alive and Die!,"I'm a student in an English 1 Honors class, and we had to read this book. Its about an average book. It's really descriptive of the old ways of a Ute. If you like that type of book you would enjoy this one. However, I believe it was drawn out to long. It could have been shortened about 50-100 pages in my opinion. It is a descent book though."
1,awful,"I found that this book, When the Legends Die, is probably one of the worst books I have ever read. Personally, I feel that the writing was choppy, the storyline made no sense, and the topics were everywhere. Buy this book if you want to, but dont make a fuss about how you had to read 216 pages about a boy that goes crazy and talks to a bear-bk03"
1,Boring As Hell,I was forced to read this in my 8th grade novels class. I didn't even read the whole thing. It dragged along so much that by the time we were halfway through the book I just stopped reading the chapters assigned to us and got my friends to tell me what happened. (I just hope Miss Doll never reads this reveiw.) I recommend this book if you don't have any anesthetic and need to be put to sleep.
1,This is one of the worst books I have ever read!,"I did NOT like this book at all! It is soooo extremely boring and the only reason why I didn't drop kick it out of my window was that it was for a school assignment! The characters were dull and with no depth, and the storyline itself went painfully slow! In my opinion, ""When the Legends Die"" should be burned and no one should ever have to read it! It's 300 pages of torture! God save those who have to read it, as I know it's a requirement at my school! What an awful book..."
3,"Kadin says, ""A good idea poorly written.""","This is a story of a Native American boy who grows up knowing only the ""old ways."" He resists the influence of the changing world around him because he knows nothing else. He is forced into learning English and continues to grow up, becomming bronco rider. I found this story to be a decent read. I like the ideas Hal Borland has to present and the concepts he provides. But I found his writing to be somewhat annoying and childish. The entire book is written in baby sentences. As Tom grows up in this book so should have the authors style of writing. Overall, not too bad Hal."
3,When the Legends Die,"The book When the Legends Die was an ok book. The message the author tried to convey was good, but overall, the book was slow and dull. The story feels like it keeps going and going, and when it seems like it is going to end, something happens and the story continues. The themes discussed in this book were good, such as roundness, living in harmony with nature, and remembering your heritage. The story is about a young Ute Indian boy who has to go live in the woods with his mother and father because his father is wanted for murdering someone who stole his money. Both his parents are killed and he is left alone in the wilderness. He is tricked by an old Ute man and is forced to live on a reservation and go to school to learn the ways of the white people. After he goes to the reservation, he forgets about his heriatige and remembers after many years."
3,An Adult Theme Written for Children,"The theme of this novel, ""When the Legends Die"", was a great theme and had the power to move one who has come to an awkward time in his or her life. The theme however, seemed to be more directed to adult life and not to a young adults, for whom the writing style showed it was written for. If the symbolism and metaphors weren't so drawn out and in your face, I feel adults would have enjoyed it more and they wouldn't have become bored so quickly. A book that reveals the thoughts of a man during his mid-life crises should not be given to young adults just because its on par with their reading level. If the writing style was more intellectual it would have turned a interesting adult story into a great novel."
2,Looking for action? Don't look here.,"If you can not stand to read an extremely slow-moving, supposed-to-be-emotional book, this is not for you. Borland struggles to keep his audience interested, and loses, if you ask me. Overall, not a book worth reading."
3,"Good, but dull beginning.","I thought, after I found out what the plot was, the book was good. However, I could not concentrate on reading the book due to its boring opening. I put myself to sleep five times while reading the beginning. The ending helps the book very much, though."
2,"A good book, but did not connect to me","This book was a slight disappointment for me. However, I'm sure many people would really feel that they could relate to this book, and would truly enjoy it. I'm just not one of those people. Not much of a tear-jerker (or a funny book), but I guess it is worth reading."
3,Well written but nothing to get excited about,"The literary techniques used were aimed for the very young adult. It taught a lesson and told the tail of the Native American depreciation quite well, but it was just not for me I guess."
3,"A book about a young man's journey, for young adult readers.","This novel is geared to the young adult reader. Re-reading it, I was amazed at the differences in the impressions I received, compared to when I read it as a young adult myself. When you get older, you perceive the world differently.This novel is therefore best read and perceived by the young adult reader. Anyone else may get a jilted impression about the themes, and storyline as they were intended to be read by the young adult audience."
2,Don't waste your time with this one!,"Some people have said that this is an interesting and engrossing book, but I found it to be the very opposite! This book was VERY slow-moving; nearly the most sluggish book I've ever read. Details can enhance a book, or they can bring it down in readibility. This book is filled with the latter. Hal Borland has written some FANTASTIC books, but this is certainly NOT one of them. Fairly well-written and mildly interesting, this one is not worth your time or money."
3,Well written but not a good plot,When The Legends Die starts out very exciting and hooks you in. But once you reach almost half way through the book takes a bad turn. The main charactor Bear Brother Black Bull [or Thomas Black Bull] turns into a bronco rider known for riding 10 horses to their deaths. I would have not gave this 3 stars but the author Hal Borland wrote the book very well. Even though the plot is sketchy I would still recomend this book to anybody that likes a action filled book
3,A memorable read.,"I read this book, like many others, as a prerequisite for minority literature class and it definitely made an impression on me. I was just searching for it to put on my historical list when I read other reviews on it. Yes it's sad, depressing and downright unhappy. It's not going to give you that warm fuzzy feeling inside. It makes you think about conditions Native Americans lived in and, in some cases, thrived in. It's a reality check."
2,"When the Legends Die, thank goodness","Hi, I had to read this book for school, and let me tell you, it was one of the worst books I have ever read. It was so bad because there were to many characters, and it was just plain boring!"
2,Was not a good alternative,"I make gluten-free bread and had been using xanthan gum as a binder, but I thought that I could substitute the guar gum, which is cheaper. My bread was falling apart when I attempted to pick it up. The bread left a slimy film on my tongue, and it was making me cough.I wanted to buy less, but the 3 bag purchase was not available. Now I have almost eight full bags of guar gum that I need to find a use for."
5,Excellent book for parents & bi-cultural children to read,"Offers a unique insight to what life is like for a bi-cultural child. I can relate very much to Tara's life as I am a parent (the American one) of two Iranian/American children. Also a wonderful opportunity to learn about customs, new words and phrases by all. I hope she writes another book very soon."
4,"well written,emotional,and oftensincere.",Tara takes the reader through waves of emotional changes particular to immigrants.first there is no place like home and then the acceptance and finally:we are here and they are there!abook which began so purely emotional becomes suitable for the western market.pity!
5,Interesting and moving account of a life in two worlds.,"This is an account by a woman who has lived in two worlds - Iran and America. As a child, she was brought to America to live following the revolution in Iran. She had to adapt to the culture here, only to readapt to a changed Iranian culture when she returned there as an adult. Her remarkable perspective gave her insights into both cultures that few people, if any, have had before. It is an interesting read that gave me a greater understanding of Iran. She has a remarkable family whose warm relationships will captivate the reader."
5,"funny, sad, thought-provoking","Read about an ordinary Iranian-American family to learn about each culture, how they compromise to get along, and how leaving one's country takes a piece out of one's soul. You can never really go back, but you can never fully leave either. Good book!"
3,It was ok,"I wasn't really that impressed with the book. It was pretty descriptive which some people might find annoying but as I read the book in one sitting it just made it more colorfull for me. Through the book I was expecting her to interpert some of the events in her life but all she did was describe them. When she is embarassed by her dad or when she is teased by other students in her school I was expecting her to draw something from it, give a conclusion. At the end the book echos her mother's sentiment when ask ""which is better Iran or the US ?"" Tara's book simply says both without bothering to look any deeper."
5,"This can interest readers on many levels:exotic, political,","This thoughtful and well observed book takes us to the old Persia and the modern Iran while throwing in contemporary California. I think anyone interested in ""a good read"" will like this book and someone who is interested in a deeper reality of politics and culture will absolutely love it."
4,A fascinating story,Bahrampour has used the details of her life in America and Iran to craft a fascinating and highly readable examination of life at the boundary between two profoundly different cultures. A splendid job for the most part. My only objection is that she seems to be trying to downplay the harshness and extremism of Iran's Islamist regime; perhaps she believes that Iran has been so maligned in America since the hostage crisis that criticizing it now would be piling on.
1,Aeon Flux Fans will Enjoy This Drivel,"I watched this and found myself wondering ""Why did I waste my time?"" This is just your basic MTV ..., just like ""Aeon Flux"" was. The character design was not very original or stunning. It was like a ten-year old drew it and some adult artists filled in the bodies. The backgrounds are well drawn and look very good. The voice acting on both the Japanese and the English tracks isn't good at all."
4,If Aeon Flux and Japanese Anime had a child....,"This would be it, and what a child it is! Now, I have not yet seen the DVD edition, but based on the first two edited episodes I caught on Adult Swim, this series is going to kick tail, and the look of it is great on the television, so the DVD can only enhance it. This is a great watch for anyone who likes Aeon Flux, anime, carnage or just a whacked-out story with rich, luscious visuals. What are you waiting for? Buy this now!"
2,Not that good,"I am a big fan of Alexander and a mild fan on Japanimation. So when I saw this at my video store I thought it would be cool, different, but entertaining. It was pretty good story wise, but I expected a lot more on the animation side. It was terrible. Some of the cuts looked like they were taken from 1980's episodes of Vultron or He-Man. It could've and should've been a lot better compared to other Japanimation stuff I've seen."
2,You wouldnt want your friends knowing you watch this...,"First off, I am a HUGE fan of anime and animation. I also find historical pieces interesting and Alexander is as good as any for subject matter. I found the story very interesting and the pacing fairly consistent and appropriate.HOWEVER, I cannot get over the art direction of this series. Small strips of leather, nut-cups, and hooker booties are the standard fare for the men and their facial structure/hair/eyes makes them appear as women for the most part...then you have the occasional female,monster,ugly little guy, etc. YUCK.Anyhow, I thought Aeon Flux kinda stunk, so if you liked THAT, you'll probably like this. Just thought some anime fans out there deserved a fair warning before spending their money."
2,Only 4 eps?,"I have really enjoyed catching bits and pieces of this series on Cartoon Network (after the excellent Home Movies) and while I'm not an animation nut (...) I think it would be very cool to have some of this because I was a huge fan of Aeon Flux when it was on Liquid Television and this series seems pretty good.But what is with only having 4 eps on a DVD?...Basically, this is the worst value I have seen since Farscape started releasing their DVDs. Disgusting, and I can see why a black market for this programming over file sharing serives has sprung up.5 stars for Reign The Conqueror. 0 stars for value. Total rating: 2 stars. 2 instead of one *only* because I'll probably still buy the first DVD so I must think it has some value."
3,May need some experience to really appreciate this,"The applications and theories presented here are good, but a reader may want to read some more basic works first, and gain a little qigong experience in order to truely appreciate it."
2,Very light on actual chi nei tsang ideas,"I wasn't impressed with this book, because it was mostly about Mantak Chia style qigong, and theory. I was looking for a more in depth book on the actual Chi Nei Tsang treatment. Chia's books on it contain more relevant info."
4,a little of everything.,"The author is a highly respected writer. He has the field well covered but I was looking for a little more technical information. Great book, very through, I would recomend it for the beginner and novice."
5,"Great game, though not U.S. version","I had missed this match on TV, so was thrilled to get my hands on the DVD. Absolutely loved watching it, fabulous match between these 2 greats. Will admit, I was disappointed it wasn't U.S. sportcasters commentating or the usual camera angles, or replays, that ESPN or the Tennis Channel offers with Grand Slams. Still, what a treat to see this classic match."
3,The Comedian Harmonists The Great Success 1,"I found the music on the CD wonderful. It is a pity that stupidity prevailed over great art. All of the tracks were tight well ""orchestrated"" (for a group with only a piano they made up a whole orchestra) pieces that would have been fantastic on a high fidelity recording. There were a few artifacts from the transfer to CD. Maybe the person who did the transfer was a bit deaf in the higher frequencys, but I can hear a noise on almost all of the tracks of the CD that could not have been present on the original 78s. They are in the range of around (guessing) 8,000Hz to 10,000Hz. This is well beyond the range of a 78 R.P.M. recording. What still was amazing about the transfer is that there is only one skip in ""Kannst Du Pfeife, Johanna?"""
1,Disappointed,I didn't find this video very helpful. It was too general and simple to be of any use. I had hoped to use this video as part of my company's training library but I don't think there is even enough value to pay employees to watch it.

1,Plastic Junk,A waste of money. It's plastic. Not metal. Broke on first use. Didn't even bother trying to replace it.
5,Seem to do the job.,"I haven't bought many rechargable batteries, but I was looking for something that would last in my wireless mice and PS2 controllers. I have used them in both for many hours with no problems and they charge in my 1-hour charger quickly."
5,Exultant Batteries,"Of course, everyone knows what is products Duracell and as especially excellent quality batteries before we know shipping batteries, and do not forget the competitors in the market and I undisputed."
1,wrong voltage/COLOR,I received an item I could have gotten here. I thought I was going to receive a 1.5 volt rechargable battery. It was a 1.2 v battery. In addition it was the wrong color to the one pictured on AMAZON.COM.
2,"Batts are good, shipping cost blows","Purchased these based on lowest price, despite not being offered any options for shipping. I wrongly assumed it wouldn't be too bad. Ended up getting them shipped very quickly, much faster than was necessary and paid over $7 shippping on a $15 purchase. Shame on me, shame on you. Would never buy from that vendor again."
1,5 days and shipped yet,Don't know how the product is but it hasn't been shipped out even after 5 business days.
2,Duracell Rechargeable 2650 mAh AAs...Dead!,"Batteries dead after moderate/infrequent Canon PowerShot A1000IS use, since their 7/2009 purchase. Severe depletion/discharge issues began after one (1) year, and attempts to ""resuscitate"" them have been unsuccessful. I would not recommend these, and will now try the Sanyo Eneloop AAs for a bit more longevity."
2,"Great at first, Died Quickly","After using some much cheaper Lenmar rechargeable NiMH batteries, I picked up a couple of these. The 2650mAh rating set them apart from the competition. I also picked up a set of Energizer 2450mAh batteries and cycled all 3 brands through my charger and into my digital camera (Canon Powershot 540) as needed.Initially the Duracell batteries were fantastic in and lasted substantially longer than the others (although not nearly as long as alkaline batteries). Oddly though, they didn't last very long. At present, the Lenmar and Energizer batteries are still working as well as the were originally and the pair of Duracell batteries are dead and will no longer charge.I don't know if I got a pair of duds or if these results are indicative of the brand.In any case, I haven't been too thrilled with any of the three brands because they seem to lose their charge over a matter of days (not weeks) when sitting on the shelf"
2,"The 2,650mAh self-drained too fast","I have eight of the 2,650mAh capacity Duracell rechargeables. Approximately two/three weeks ago, I recharged the entire set of eight batteries. Yesterday I found out that the three batteries I just put in the toy were dead. That surprised me. From now on, I will stick with the pre-charged, low self-drain batteries, e.g. Sanyo Eneloop."
1,Dead after less than a year!,The title says it all: Bought 8 of them at Target less than a year ago. Now they are kind of dead: They would keep their charge for not more than a couple of days and then they go dead immediately. My SB-600 Flash wouldn't even work with a fresh charged load after recycling (the flash charge) for 3-4 times. After doing some research I only buy Sanyo Eneloop. They haven't let me down yet.
1,Don't last,"I've used several brands of rechargeable batteries through the years (Monster, Radioshack, rayovac, etc.). They're all still working (recharge and hold their charge). The newer duracells rechargeable batteries are all DEAD (won't recharge to more than .6V). Could it be that duracell purposefully makes really crappy rechargeables to sell more regular batteries? Surely not!? or? Note: This review applies to Duracell Rechargeable AA NiMH 2650mAh AND 2500mAh batteries (strangely the Duracell AAA seem fine)."
3,2300 mAH made in China,"I bought two packs and both were 2300 mAH made in China and not the 2500 mAH made in Japan some have reported. The 2500 mAH Duracell cells are made by Sanyo and are the best NiMH AA available. These aren't nearly as good.They don't stand up to high discharge rates nearly as well as the 2500 mAH Duracell labelled Sanyo cells and deliver much less useable capacity when run hard.They also appeared to have been maunufactured a while back and needed 5-6 charge/discharge cycles as initial capacity was very poor with large capacity differences between cells. Take off at least 1 star if you're not prepared to cycle them individually before use. If you don't, expect poor run times and short cell life since the lower capacity cells will be overdischarged and damaged.Saved about $5 per pack over the 2500 mAH cells but frankly it wasn't worth it."
1,Bad right out of the package,"Very disappointed in these particular Duracell rechargeables, the HR6 DC1500 series. I've purchased a 4-pack and 8-pack from two different sources and both have had individual batteries that would not hold a charge right out of the package. I have Duracell HR6 DX1500 series rechargeable batteries (the ones with the traditional ""copper-top"" look) and those have performed much better. I would recommend against buying the black and green ones."
1,for the brand its a very bad quality batteries,I have buy the 8 rechageable AA bateries im very desapoint the batteries dont keep the charge for a longer only for a days!
5,Excellent,"I've used these batteries extensively since purchasing, always fully rechanged, no end in sight. Very pleased, considering an additional purchase. Already saved significantly since using rechargeable batteries, wish I had done it sooner."
1,Don't hold charge after 1 year of use (but very few recharges).,"Granted it took almost three weeks to get them via the free shipping option (ordered Feb 8 2006, shipped Feb 24 2006), I'm happy to see that both of my sets are 2500 mAh and made in Japan. AA/HR6/DC1500 NiMH/1.2V/2500 mAh. Ordered from Amazon.com, not any other merchant. I haven't tried them yet -- the 5 star rating is for mAh and the price I paid ($10.42 per set).Update: these batteries stopped holding the charge after about a year of use. If I could rate them again, I'd give them no stars. I tried renewing them with the La Crosse charger to no avail."
2,Poor rechargability,"I bought two 4-packs of ""AA"" rechargeable batteries because I was hoping to save money. I've successfully recharged the batteries probably eight times. Since then, they no longer hold a charge. One of the eight batteries does not even register in the charger. If the batteries sit on a shelf for a few days, they're dead. I would avoid these batteries."
5,The Best,"Duracell is the best battery out there, especially the rechargables. I would swap Duracell with Energizers in my digital camera every other time I needed to charge my batteries. My last set out-lasted Energizers hands down."
1,Discharge without use,"These are horrible!! For comparison - I have been using Sony and Panasonic rechargeable for years. The batteries I bought in Japan in 2003 still charge and last month without usage. My style is I carry spares, when the battery runs down I pull out the spare. That night I charge the dead battery which becomes the spare. That way I'm always with power EXCEPT that the Duracell 2650 AA batteries are ALWAYS dead when I try to use them. So in my book they are useless!!"
3,Check out the benefits of the pre-charged batteries before you buy,"Duracell still makes the best quality batteries; including this set. But there are new better technology. This NiMh is old school. Check out the benefits of the pre-charged batteries before you buy this set. Duracell also make one of the best quality low-discharged batteries out there. Honestly, except for the higher capacity (2650mAH), the low-discharged batteries has more benefits. You can also use them on your remotes or clocks and will last longer between charges. The cost difference is also not much."
1,Don't buy. Useless.,I have tried to use them in remote control and in PC keyboard and they last just a couple of days.No-name batteries with lesser capacity I got through another web site last 10 times longer.
2,Watch out!,"I got Eveready batteries when I ordered this. I was expecting Duracell and that's what I wanted. When I searched in Amazon for ""Duracell rechargeable AAA,"" these came up with a photo of Duracell rechargeable batteries. But vendor Supernova shipped Eveready rechargeables, which I am not keen about using in my Duracell charger (especially when I go off to work and leave it alone all day). Note that it does not say ""Duracell"" in the product description, even though the photo is of Duracell batteries. I expected more from Amazon and its vendors. From now on, if I want Duracell, I will be sure that it says so in the product description. Starting now, because even if the Eveready batteries seem to recharge fine in the Duracell charger, I will not be comfortable leaving them in the Duracell charger for hours."
2,NOT up to Duracell reputation,"I used these in my digital camera, and they didn't hold a charge after less than a hundred cycles. Very disappointed in these. Expected more. On the other hand, I have Energizers that are still doing just fine after two years. Would not recommend Duracells for heavy duty rechargeable use."
4,Good rechargeable battery,"I have had good luck with the Duracell 2650 in the past so at $19.95 I bought this 8 pack. The packing was a little rough looking and the manufacture date was over a year ago, but they perform okay. They powered my SX10 IS very well although I only got about 120 flash shots over a 3 week period before the batteries were down. Possibly they will do better after a few charges."
4,No issues,The package was shipped well with in time and in good condition. I didn't have aby issues.
2,"These are 2050 mAh, NOT 2030 mAh!","Although the description says: ""2300mAh - high charging capacity"", these are really 2050 mAh batteries. Amazon.com should drop the price for these batteries and should update their description so it doesn't catch other buyers off-guard.I bought these BECAUSE it was rated 2300 mAh. Otherwise, I might have chosen a different brand or not made a purchase at all."
2,Duracell admits they won't hold a charge for long,"After buying two packs of these AA and two of the AAA and having all of them not hold a charge when not in use for longer than about 10 days, I called Duracell. They admitted that these high capacity batteries will only hold a charge no more than two weeks, and if I wanted batteries that held a charge when not in use, I should choose the pre-charged. They sent me coupons to get some as replacements which was appropriate. Why would anyone make batteries that can not hold a charge long enough to have them ready for when they are needed? Less than two weeks just doesn't make sense."
1,Blinkins Bear & Blizzard,I never received the item but I did get my refund immediately once I reported that I did not get my item.
4,!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,i couldn't find this anywhere around this time and you guys had it that just amaze's me and the prices are unbeatable i'll be back
2,Must hire mechanic to install,"I think the boards look great -- but after dropping an additional $80 on the install kit, I was ready to be done spending money. After the boards and install kit arrived, it became clear there was no way I was installing these on my own. The instructions were minimal and the pictures made no sense. I spent another $232 at an auto service shop having them installed."
3,Westin step boards 27-6110,"Boards fit perfectly,but did not include mounting hardware which had to be purchased separately. This was not pointed out when I made the purchase from Amazon. When I tried to buy the proper hardware from Amazon it was not available for my vehicle. I was forced to purchase this hardware from an on-line auto parts supplier. I will be reluctant to make any future purchases from Amazon."
