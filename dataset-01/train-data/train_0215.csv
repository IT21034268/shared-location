4,Elvis Song,"The Elvis Song in the movie ""The Rookie"" is called ""Run On"" It's a gospel song Elvis did in the 60's. I wish it was on this Soundtrack. EP Enterprises may have not granted permission to put it on the soundtrack. Who knows? It's a great upbeat Gospel song. Elvis Gospel songs are excellent. I recommend - ""Elvis Presley - Amazing Grace"" The Double CD collection - if you are looking for that Song"
4,Great value for the price,"Excellent soundtrack and great price through sbcglobal.net (Amazon Marketplace). Excellent turn-around time, received item within a week."
4,missing song title,The name of the song when they are celebrating in the locker room is called 'jump around' originally by House of Pain. It is also in the movie from1993 called mrs doubtfire.This is a wonderful movie and can be enjoyed by the entire family. I highly recommend it!!
3,Looking for info,Does anyone know the artist / song title played in the movie during the locker room scene after the team won the district championship?I thought that was a great scene with the players dancing in the and his son laughing.
4,Something missing,"There is a song missing from the soundtrack. It think it played right after ""Stuff That Works"" and ""Slow Turning"" - it sounded like Elvis Presley, and it was pretty upbeat. I know it played when Dennis Quaid was pitching to his high school students for the first time. Does anyone know what the title of the song is, and who sang it??"
2,Trailer Song,"I don't have the CD either, and probably won't get it - only because it doesn't have LIGHTNING CRASHES by Live (song on the advertisement)."
3,Elvis Song,There was also an Elvis song in the movie that isn't on the soundtrack. Does anyone know the title?
1,*CAUTION* Swallowed Ball,"I was lying down to go to sleep when I felt something weird in my mouth. Well it turned out that the top ball from the tongue ring had some how undone itself, and fell in my throat. This is not the first time that one of the acrylic tongue rings that I have orderd from this web site have done this. Most of them the ball from the top cracks and it just comes off. It's quite irritating."
5,Beautiful,"My dad's birthday came around and we looked high and low for a tie bar locally. None of them were all that stunning. My mom and I picked out this one on Amazon and my dad loved it.Well made, and looks as stunning as the picture. It came with a nice box and shipped really fast (note the shipping price, they really did ship for the amount, so it was worth it)."
1,Winter Wonderland,I thought this video was terrible. I could not believe most of the video was taken from a camera pointed out the side or back of the train and turned on to record. The only good part of this video was the archived footage from the steam locomotives that were included in. This video can not keep the attention of my four year old son who loves trains. I clearly expected better.
4,A Great Sampler,We may be zone 4 for DVD and PAL television (not NTSC) but we have our methods of beating the system.Found this to be a great introduction to Amtrak services with great views of the US countryside and informative commentary. Particularly liked the fact that where the scenery or train dominated the screen the narration stopped. Very rare in this type of program.The side excursions on preserved lines were interesting and whetted the appetite to try them myself.Having always intended to tour the US and Canada by rail I can only say keep lobbying your government to keep Amtrak funded - its an asset worth keeping.Also purchased 'Travel the World by Train - North America' (don't bother) and The Great Trans-American Ride (not bad).
1,lifeless and Dull,"lifeless and Dull one more time. The masters used for this recording and digital processing just plain ripped the sparkle and air out of these 10 tracks. It's just awful to try and listen to this as I loved Nat style but this will never see my CD player again and let alone be ripped to my computer.Save your money and shame on the Canadian Company, Legacy for surely damaging or at least tainting a great singers work.10 tracks, 28 minutes."
5,whats in the attic,"Excellent and enjoyable reading for preschool children.My sons loved it and they have asked me to read it almost every night since I purchased this inexpensive, entertaining and colorful book."
2,"Half Games, Half Comedians","GGW is advertising their Games dvd again, as if it were new, but it is clearly this same old show. This so easily could have been excellent - clever games, naked women. However,(1) Some of the ""games"" obviously had not been tested: the spinning bed ""game"" doesn't work, it just slips off and there is no way to judge who won.(2) It is censored - there is very little nudity or shots below the navel. By and large this is a bikini and topless competition.(3) Some of the women are genuinely beautiful, but there are more 7s and 8s than you would ever see in a Playboy or Penthouse video.(4) An awful lot of time is spent without any women on the screen (it seemed almost half the running time) as the comic hosts tell bad jokes.This should have been better."
4,A must have for any Sport Erotica Enthusiast,"Although it's not the best Girls Gone Wild video you'll ever see, it certainly is up there. It is the best erotic sports movie I have ever seen. The only reason I give it four stars is that it is not as good as the commercial let on.The DVD That usually comes along with this is not that bad either. Another Standard Girls Gone Wild vidoe. What I find nice about it is that it dosen't beat around the bush. It gets right to the action, unlike some other naked sports videos. It also lets you see behind the scenes a little wich was extreamly hot and sexy. If you are considering to get this DVD, stop thinking and just get it. You wont regret it."
2,Not so great,"Girls gone wild games takes place on fantasy island. The girls are split into teams and compete for points. The girls are supposed to be ""naked"" but they are mostly just topless. There are cutscenes interrupting the games and the games really aren't too wild. This old title could be a lot better"
3,Escape to paradise ..,"Bikini babes on the beach is what the Beach Guru loves .. and this video provides tons of those! and playing games as well! Hot, hot, hot! So, put this DVD on, and escape to paradise ... wish there was more stuff like this .. in Brazil, Thailand, etc .. for more like this, but with better music, check out ""Wild Girls Thailand"" (ASIN B000F6YVRW)."
3,"Works, but needs to be more powerful.","I've had this product for over a year, and I still use it from time to time. It's somewhat effective to use for spring cleaning, but quite time consuming as it is not powerful at all. It cleans my leather couch better than any chemical cleaner I have used, though. I wish it was more powerful to clean grout better. I have dogs, and I must say that steaming the tile gets any odors out, but I personally wish I would have gone with the McCulloch MC 1275 (more powerful) one."
3,Steamfast cleaner,"After having read many reviews on this product, I decided to try it. The first time I used it was on my kitchen tile floor and it did a great job. The second time was in my bathroom which has small tiles and it was harder to clean the floor with all the grooves. So, overall it isn't bad and does clean my kitchen floor much faster and better than any mop. It would be nice however if someone would make an industrial strength floor steamer that was affordable.Virginia Beach,VA"
4,Happy in Portland,"This steamer worked great on my kitchen floor. In fact the steam was so hot I had to turn it down to medium, because it was actually lifting the linoleum up from the floor. It took off many years of gunk that I could not have gotten off otherwise.The steamer however, in the shower, did nothing noticeable. I wanted it to clean the grout , but did not see a difference."
5,Excellent little mop with super cleaning power,"I struggled with which mop to buy, and decided on this based on the reviews here. I have not been disappointed! It is compact and easy to store. It heats up VERY quickly - even faster than we had anticipated. It has clips in the top, so any microfiber or terry cloth towel works as a ""mop head."" The cord is short, but we simply attach a 10 ft. extension cord and it does just fine. The short cord keeps it out of the way while mopping. I'd highly recommend this product - it's fast and easy to use. I will be keeping my floors cleaner - a necessity with two young children and a dog - with this mop."
1,single use only,"Case worked perfectly for the first few days on shallow dives. Seal wore out after 4 uses. Kinda useless then isn't it? Also, cannot find replacement seal."
3,Be very careful!,"The product worked well until we forgot to dutifully check the seal one time. Oops. There must've been a hair or piece of dust that compromised the seal. Our camera met its match in the salt water. Luckily, it was the second to last day of our three week vacation, and we were able to salvage the memory card. My advice to folks who buy this product is to ALWAYS check & double-check the seal. I would also recommend dunking it in freshwater before taking it into saltwater. If there is a small freshwater leak, you can usually dry it without the devastating corrosive effects of a full-on saltwater leak."
4,Great for what its for!,"This case works pretty good. Used it for 3 days snorkling in Belize and got some great pics. Only problem I had was it is hard to see the screen when there is really bright light. Those that bought this for diving, probably should read the limitations on it before they buy, because it shouldn't get a bad review because you are too lazy to read the specifications."
1,Not for Diving!,"If you would like to take a picture of the bottom of your pool, this product is awesome. Otherwise, it's pretty useless. Why does Canon only deliver 100-foot rated underwater cases for SOME of their cameras? I made the mistake of buying the SD450, and am now stuck with a camera that cannot be used for diving... unless you're will to risk taking it down in this POS case."
3,Swiss Blades,Not impressed. Some came with no teeth at all and some don't last well at all and I have been piercing for 3 years
4,"Nice square whiteboard, not so nice marker","Whiteboad is a good fit for our mud room wall - use this as a freezer inventory board for our food in the garage. Easy install with good mounting and easy marker attachment (and I'm not handy at all).Marker itself didn't last very long though. Good first time use, then dried out and had to get new markers."
1,Depending on your political persuasion,"""It is neither honest nor objective to describe popular teaching practices in a neutral manner if they do not stand up to the standards of social justice or education research. We do not believe that the world is a neutral place or that teaching is a neutral profession."" Introduction to Teaching, etc.Be forwarned that this is not a textbook that even tries to be objective about the history of teaching and learning. It is vehemently anti-traditionalist, and glowingly pro-constructivist.For traditionalists or people looking for a balanced view of the history of American schooling, this work rates 1 star.For constructivists or marxists this would be a 5 star."
3,Entertaining but weak in writing skill and quality of advice,"I enjoyed the first more-than-half of the book which dealt with various kinds of social engineering attacks. Each was at least plausible and usually interesting. I was constantly aware, however, that the titles of the chapters only vaguely correlated to the examples given: there must be a better way to structure the content (possibly starting with defining various kinds of attacks then identifying those techniques as they come up in the examples.)The latter part of the book dealt with corporate solutions and fell short of its mark. For instance, the audience is constantly reminded to keep their employees vigilant and interested because it's easy to let security policies slip, yet the methods advised were right from the corporation playbook: the kinds of things office workers love to make fun of and always circumvent for convenience. I was disappointed to find such a lackluster set of solutions."
3,Make sure you don't get hacked,"Don't support this con-man any more than you have to. Go to the library and read it there, or find a nice coffee/book shop and read it in-store. If you have to own it, buy the book used.These strategies will help you reap the ""benefit"" of this book just as much as anyone else and the author and publisher only get paid once. Share the love!In short, I don't believe in legitimizing Mitnick's criminal past by turning his exploits, stories and strategies into ""advice"" for those of us that should already know better. However if you're interested in the subject then you might as well read the book."
1,No Hack Just Con,"It's amazing that on the book jacket bio of Kevin, it is NEVER mentioned that he was in jail.Kevin is a criminal and even less of a hacker than a complete con-man. Kevin positions himself as a Security Expert when all he could really advertise himself as a BS-Detector Consultant.I agree the legal system failed in the case of not actually charging him while holding him for so long. But he ain't exactly Snow White, he had MANY chances to go straight after being constantly caught, yet he kept up like an addict.The only Art of Deception in this book is the con of getting you to buy this."
1,Mitnick was never a wiz kid - he was a criminal though.,"Hmmm. Amazon seems to have deleted my earlier review - I'll make it short. Mitnick is not a great hacker, he's a con artist. After reading his book there is virtually NOTHING about protecting yourself from hackers but maybe some ideas about protecting yourself from ex-convict con artists."
1,Kevin Mitnick Book,"I'm sorry, but a book by an ex-hacker who got caught in 1981 isn't my idea of hacking educational material. Those who know Mitnick's background know exactly why he is being pushed upon us as a 'reformed' expert hacker. A 'hacker' who last practiced his criminal behavior in 1981 knows less about today's technology than an AOL user does."
5,Mitnick sticks to his guns,"Mitnick never described himself as a ""hacker"" but rather a ""social engineer"". Good at it and well articulated in this text. Shame a crook can make so much ill gotten gain from being good at his illegal endeavors"
3,Very interesting book,This book seriously highlights the stupidity of people in the world. It shows how clever people go very far by asking basic questions to get what and where they want. The samples are entertaining and worth reading. This is some great education for the naive people of the world.
2,The Art of Deception ...,Mitnick shows that he is a master of the obvious. Guess what? Untrained users are the weakest links in your company's non existent security policy. The book is a set of long rambling stories about fictitious amateur con artists designed to be thinly veiled as Mitnick's own personal conquests... There isn't anything in this book that would help anyone but the truly clueless and seems to be written for young misguided computer enthusiasts.
2,fun read but outdated,"The stories told by Mitnick in this book are very entertaining to read, but I do think that businesses today (certainly enterprises) have done a lot of work in countering practices described by Mitnick. After a story, there is always an explanation of the con and what you can do about it (which is usually not much). These comments are very obvious most of the time. So of the 368 pages, there are about 200 that are an entertaining read. The last chapter covers how you can improve the security (and security procedures) of your company. Again, some are obvious, some of these notes are already widely implemented today. It's a fun read but the book hasn't aged well."
2,Too corporate self-help,"Kevin Mitnick was a gifted social engineer, so I was looking forward to reading about the tricks he'd used. Instead, I was disappointed to see the book is totally geared to the corporate director that has NO clue about computer security. The vast majority of the 'lessons' are embarrassingly common-sense:- lock your computer- don't write down passwords or codes- don't give out confidential information- check everyone's creditentials or IDThat's about it. Of course, you're missing out on the pages upon pages of rehashing the same lessons over and over, but if someone needs that kind of reinforcement to learn, maybe they need this book. :)"
2,Quite trivial,"I purchased this book based on several reviews including the few in amazon.com. What a disappointment. The book is a compendum of anecdotal evidence presented as ""true stories"", all of them of varying degrees of credibility.All the stories can be summed up in two words: identity theft. each story is told twice, once as Dr. Watson would have seen it at first, and once as Mr. Holmes would have explained it.At the end there is a review of what are the ""best practices"" of security, which is quite superficial to be interesging or valuable. All in all, the Sherlock adventures are a better reading; and a serious approach when drafting a security policy would be more useful than wasting time on reading this book.Get it from the library."
2,Terrible,"This book starts of interesting however the book goes on and on and on about scenarios involving people over the phone,it rarely mentions person to person or online scams.The book suggested solutions to preventing social engineering attacks is really poor,I enjoyed the book for a few days but its really same old all the way through,many of the stories read like Hack Philes you can find on the net,full of lies and waffle.You will find your self bored of the book,there are plenty of copies of it on e-bay for a reason,buy it for sentiment only and because its black.I can't believe its by Mitnick"
3,Meh...,"Overall, presents a good perspective of social engineering from a layman's point of view. Most of the stories Kevin tells in the book are related to exploiting the phone system and ""mainframes"", so you have to shift his theories and points into today's frame of reference in order for them to be relevant. That said, Kevin is a cornerstone in the information security arena and this book is considered a classic among professionals. Buy it, read it, and then pass it on. Not something I'd read twice..."
3,DECEPTION,"WHILE I FOUND THE BOOK WELL WRITTEN AND INFORMATIVE, I FELT THE SUBJECT MATTER WAS NOT AS FULLYINFORMATIONAL FOR THE MANAGEMENT CANDIDATE THAT WOULD READ THIS....ESSENTIALLY I FOUND THE EARLY PARTOF THE BOOK TO BE ABOUT DECEPTIVE PRACTICES BEING USED 20 YEARS AGO.....MUCH LIKE WATCHING AN OLDMISSION IMPOSSIBLE TV SHOW....I WOULD CERTAINLY RECOMMEND THIS FOR ANY NEOPHYTE, BUT I PERSONNALLYWAS LOOKING FOR MORE ""CUTTING EDGE"" IDEAS AND PRACTICES...I SUPPOSE THE AUTHOR WOULD(AND DOES) RESPOND THAT WITH EVEN THE BEST SECURITY SYSTEMS, THE HUMAN ELEMENT IS ALWAY THE WEAKEST LINK AND FOR THAT FACT, I SEE THE VALUE IN THIS PRODUCT.HOWEVER, FOR THE SAVVY MANAGEMENT, LOOK ELSEWHERE FOR THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY(DIGITAL RECOGNITION) AND PERSONALITYRECOGNITION TESTING..."
3,The Greatest Hack,"Kevin Mitnick&#65533;s &#65533;The Art of Deception&#65533; is his greatest (to date) successful attempt of the &#65533;hacking&#65533; on a mass scale. Not only he got to disseminate the craft cleverly bypassing probation restrictions, but also in doing so he legitimately got paid. Bravo.The content - amusing (hence 3 stars) mix of anecdotes and corporate manuals, presents no news to a professional. Better books were written on the subject. It is also unfortunate that the term ""social engineering"" stuck, though the desire of the con man to call himself something other then scumbag is understood."
4,great book!,"This is a great book for managers.It is very non-technical and very interesting.If this book does not scare the heck out of managers, nothing will."
4,Nice,"Interesting book. If you are bored or just need a book to read, read this one. It can provide some incites"
3,"Starts ok, becomes repetitive & boring.","I'm a big fan of social engineering. I find it supremely interesting. This book starts out alright, with a couple of interesting examples, but as you get deeper into the book, it becomes repetitive, and ultimately, boring.I couldn't even force myself to finish this book. Every example boils down to this: people are gullible and dumb, and if you display any sort of confidence, you're more likely to be believed."
5,Excellent insight into social engineering,"I'm responsible for securing our company's network, which includes writing security policies and guidelines for users to follow. Like many people in the industry, much of my security training has been focused almost exclusively on the technologies used to attach and defend networks. But more and more, I think we are all beginning to realize there is a very important human element involved as well. Mitnick does a great job in this book of giving the security professional insight into the social engineering techniques used to take advantage of either weakness or ignorance in a particular target. I've found this book as useful as any in my library."
3,You're already a victim,"If you're reading this, you're already a victim of ""social engineering"" as Mitnick calls it. You somehow believe that reading these reviews will tell you whether the book is OK or not. But these reviews can be entered by anyone. Perhaps Mitnick has entered most of them himself or his publisher did the same; you'll never know.So instead go down to the local bookstore, handle a copy and determine for yourself."
4,"Mixed feelings, but still a useful book","Kevin Mitnick IS a criminal. I have problems abetting his profiting from his crimes. However, that aside; this is a useful book. I am also put-off by his boastfulness.A well-run and maintained network is difficult to attack. Not impossible, just difficult. The easiest way to subvert most systems is the weakest component - the people. People want to be helpful and too often are not aware of the impact of even simple slips. People are also lazy. They write down passwords, circumvent security systems that seem burdensome, and do not report obvious attempts to access system.Mitnick show us that the most difficult part of any security system is to educate the users and to obtain their buy in that a secure system is a benefit."
3,"very repetitive, very repetitive","ok, kevin, so people are gullible. you can fool them into trusting you, even when they shouldn't. but does it take hundreds of pages to say this?thanks to mr. mitnick, we now have another voice telling us that there are bad people out there that are willing to take advantage of anyone they can to further their own purposes. nothing really revealing or new here, and the book tends to repeat this theme over and over and over.next time you try to drink out of the milk container when noone's looking, just think how you could be exhibiting early signs of a security guru."
4,Definitve Text on Social Engineering,"Definitive discussion of ""social engineering"" or deceptive practices to gain access to a company's data. Typically information security discussions center on technology (antivirus, firewall, intrusion detection), but this book makes clear that the weakest link in most security chains are the people in the organization. Only through a good policy and training can this weakness be addressed. A must read for anyone seriously interested in information security."
2,Dated Material,The book was OK but it's a few years old. The techniques the author used to defeat computer networks and the people that use them have changed a bit. Interesting stories but not as relevant as they were when he wrote them.
3,Worth Checking,"I was in London the week of this movies release so I can say Ive been lucky enough to have seen it.There has been a wave of so called hood movies coming out of Britain at the moment, and this film focuses around the lives of a girl gang (hence the derogatory term, Sket) and the (naive) main character. It also features ""Asher D"" from Get Rich Or Die Trying.Being one who enjoys international films (Harry Brown, Adulthood), I personally enjoyed this and think it worth watching. However, its in no way a classic."
3,Okay I guess but way too small,"It plays my MP3's, but the thing is TINY. It barely fits on me and folds the tops of my ears down. I'm hoping it will stretch out with time, but it really should have been either larger or adjustable. If I had bought this locally, I would have taken it back for that reason."
3,does not resume playback in middle of mp3 file,"I listen to mp3 lectures from The Teaching Company on this thing, and I am annoyed that when you turn it on, it does not resume playing an mp3 file from the same point where it was turned off. It just starts playing from the beginning of the track. That's very inconvenient if you have huge mp3 lectures, because it takes you 5-10 minutes to find where you left off.My other mp3 player does this, but it is not ""wireless"". In other respects, I am content with this player."
1,"Great idea, bad execution",Multiple problems with these headphones. I use them for voice tracks so I have no comment on sound quality. There is no display so there is no way to know what is happening with the system when you press a button. There is no repeat function. The headphones will only play one track over and over again -- I can't forward to another track. I'm very displeased and am going to return them.
2,Limited Usefulness,"I bought this headset to go jogging with. I can't use it for that, or for much else. There is no way to put a ""playlist"" on the player, so any songs you put on the player seem to play in a random order. Also, I can't download my Audible.com audio to it, and it's not a device recognized by Napster to Go (the legal way to put downloaded music onto portable devices). Beyond that, the design of the phones hurts to wear for more than a short time, and even though they're touted as ""sports headphones"", they don't stay in place well while jogging.All that being said, the sound is good, and the price is cheap, so I'll probably end up keeping them because of the wireless convenience of listening to a few tracks in a random order for a short time. Grrr."
1,Are You Kidding ?,"Dont smoke, drink, eat bad food, loose weight and dont get stressed out. Thats the book in a nutshell and he is the best in the buisness ? If you want some interesting reading, research Leptin books on amazon."
1,Incorrect Info,"I had to return this item. Description stated 18 inch toy, however when I received this item it was a small 6 inch McDonalds toy that they used to give out in Happy Meals. Amazon was very helpful with the return."
1,Not worth this price tag.,"This product has a lot of quality and it's all low. For the price of this you could get 3 buckets of chocolate ice cream from a grocery store, eating the ice cream would be more enjoyable, and it would take longer to eat it than it does to watch this DVD. Additionally, if you gained some extra weight and want to remove it, you can just go to the gym, but the time wasted on this DVD cannot be recovered."
1,Cheap Burned DVDRs,This show is not the quality of other more famous shows available on DVD. The DVDs are poor quality DVD-Rs (burned discs) in cheap thin packs with copied inserts. I purchased this show and it didn't work on my Sony 200 disc DVD player because it was a DVDR - I had to return it to Amazon. [...]. People who are thinking about purchasing this series should know that it is not as good as others out there. Save your money.
1,Even Worse,"This was even worse than the first season. What happened, did your camera man find another job and take his camera with him? And you can't even afford a DVD case to send this in? I got this in two blank jewel-cases and the title was hand-written on the DVD in marker!Chris, just admit it, you have no talent, that's probably why you dropped out of film school. Go do something else with your life other than pretending you can act."
5,Great Gate!,"We have these for our dogs--German Shepherds--and they are plenty tall, wide, and strong enough! I had a terrible time finding wide gates that could hold up to big dogs and these definitely do the job!"
1,Broke on third time!,The third time I went to latch this gate in to place it busted in two. I was very disappointed and should really send it back.
1,THIS SHOULD BE RECALLED! GATE IS A DANGER TO CHILDREN!!!,"Our 22 mo. old threw his blanket over the gate and tried to retrieve the blanket and got his hand stuck in between the squares, and I mean PAINFULLY stuck. Thank God I was able to gently get his hand back out. I later had my husband hold 2 fingers in the square (3/4 the size of the regular squares) where our son had his hand and I then attempted to unlock the gate and just the motion of unlocking the gate COULD HAVE created the space smaller, pinching into our son's wrist even more. THERE ARE NO WARNINGS ON THIS GATE ABOUT SMALL CHILDREN GETTING THEIR HANDS OR FEET STUCK. It is common sense though and one would think that a child would be able to bring their hand back out. But because he got it between the end where the gates overlap, the area was smaller. I see the far edges are smaller too. I wouldn't even trust this gate for an animal. I will be calling the company the next business day."
4,Evenflo Wire Mesh Gate worked fine for me!,"I am back to order two more of these gates, because for the money, they were the tallest, the best, & the sturdiest I could find. I use them to keep my dogs out of the bedrooms, & also to separate new feline family members from each other until they get used to the others. I do have 2 that will climb up them, & have only knocked them down maybe twice out of dozens of times. Plus, the cats won't fit through the wire mesh, where they do with the flimsier plastic grate models. It's not 100% purfect, but perhaps 95%! And very affordable compared to pet store ones!"
1,This gate is useless,"Do not buy this gate unless you want an inferior product. I could not have been more underwhelmed by a product. In fact, this gate is potentially dangerous and should be taken off the market. It does not work."
4,Raw and unspoiled British R & B,"This CD is a good compilation of raw and unspoilt British R&B; from the Sixties. If you like the early Rolling Stones or Kinks you will like this one. This is no music tailored for charts but pure early R & B,This group is still going on tour with 3 original band members and the are still going strong after 45 years of making music sticking to their music which was way ahead of its time in the Sixties.The first part of the CD is undoubtedly better than the second one which is more psychelic music.Get this one and hear what Sixties Pop/R&B; was all about"
3,Fair,"This group was criticized as a cheap Rolling Stones. There first L.P. was a classic for the garage groups and 5 aongs are featured here. ""Dream Joey"" was great, many critic praises for their later albums, but I guess I don't get most of it. Boring music mostly. But if you are looking for the best of this is it!"
3,I Gave it 3 out of 5,"- ""The Art of Keeping Cool"" Is about a boy named Robert and his cousin Elliot. When Roberts father goes to fight in the war (World War 2) him and his mom move to his dads parents house with his cousin Elliot, his mom and dad. Elliot is into art, but when a German artist moves into town and Elliot starts visiting him things go haywire, because his country is at war with Germany. Then Robert must solve to find out about his family secrets. It is a good book. There is also humor for fans of comedy."
4,The Art of Keeping Cool,"The Art of Keeping Cool, kept my attention with the stories of Elliot and Robert, as they live their lifes during the WWII. All the while, I still learned about WWII. Very good book, and I will read it again in the future. :D7||=|="
4,A War at Home,"I read the book called The Art of Keeping Cool by Janet Taylor Lisle. I liked the book because it's historical fiction.The book is about a boy named Robert who lives in Sachem`s Head, Rhode Island with his cousin Elliot. In the beginning Robert lives on a farm and has to move because his dad is in England fighting the war, Robert does not like this.If you would like to know more about this book pick up a copy today!"
3,Cool Book,The Art of Keeping Cool is about a boy named Robert and his family moving to live in a cottage near his grandparent's house during World War II. He discovers a secret about his father while trying to protect his cousin's relationship with a German artist.I recommend this book to people who like war and mysteries.
4,A good book,"In the book the art of keeping cool it's about three main people. Robert, Eliot, and Able. This story takes place in Ohio and Road Island Robert father is over in England he is a pilot, his leg is messed up and that is why he is a pilot. Roberts grandpa dose not agree with Robert so when Roberts father is a young boy he gets shot in the leg. Robert is very mad at his grandpa. Eliot is an artist and able helps him draw. Able is an artist from Germany and the US is against them in the war. Able kills himself and Elliot did not try to do anything."
3,a good book.,"This book is very good but there are times were it gets a little boring. But there were also times when I could not put it down. It is a good story of World War II, but I think the author should have focused more on the characters of Robert and Elliot and less on World War II."
4,The Art of Keeping Cool,"Are you tired of the same old boring books? Then The Art of Keeping Cool by Janet Taylor Lisle is for you! This book is about a boy named Robert and his cousin Elliot who see big guns pulling into Sachems Head, Rhode Island during WW2. Later on, Elliot meets a well known artist named Abel Hoffman, a German, who gets spotted at the firing of the big guns. Robert and his younger sister also spot Abel Hoffman at the firing of the big guns. Shortly after the firing, an F.B.I. agent comes to Robert's house for questioning. At that point, Abel is severely hated since town folk think he's a German spy.This was a very good book with a shocking end! But don't take my word for it, read it yourself and experience the story."
3,The Art Of Keeping Cool,"The Art of Keeping Cool is about a story of a young boy named Robert, who used to live on a farm with his mother and sister while his father was at war. His mother, however is unable to keep the farm running with little help, and moves to a town called Sachem's Head in Rhode Island. They end up moving next door to his grandparents, and over time, becomes friends with his cousin, Elliot.The story is rather quite dull at times and slow moving. It quickly lost my intrest, but at times caught my attention. The story does have very little suspense, such as the mystry of the families past and the mysterious man Abel Hoffman, but The Art Of Keeping Cool was good, but not the best novel I have read, so I awarded this book 3 stars."
2,It was a public library book!,I was not inpressed with this purchase. I was trying to find a book on line to replace the lost public library book.When we got the book it was from a Cleveland public library. Which was hard to take this book to our public library in replacement of the lost one. Not happy with purchase. The seller should have said it had public library book that was very used and stamped all over.
3,Cute - Pern - A Fanatic's Book.,"I special ordered this book several eons ago simply because it was related to Pern. It's a ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" type book -- not a novel. I read most of the ""plotlines"" without properly playing the game. Nye developed several interesting storylines(occurring between ""The White Dragon"" and the last few chapters of ""Renegades""). I won't give the plotlines away -- simply because there's too many of them! It's an interesting point of view on the Southern Continent, it's a cute read -- but it's not necessary for your collection."
5,"great, simple reading about retirement",He answers all the questions you possibly could come up with while keeping the language simple and readable. Bravo.
3,"Very vocal, not much else..","I listened to clips of the songs ""The snake"" and ""I am eve"" off the Mediaeval Baebes website. Little did I know those were the only really good tracks.---The whole rest of the cd is overly vocal. what I mean is it has great vocals (what else should you expect from these girls) but lacks good layering and especially good beats.---The only song I truly love off this cd is ""the snake."" It has an outstandingly danceable beat with a fast pace and great vocals.""I am eve"" and ""lick the maypole"" are good. I am eve is pretty, quick, and has interestingly nice chanting in the background at parts.---Unfortunatley, this didnt have many good songs, but I gave the cd a three *s because of the greatness of ""The snake"" And the sleeve art is very pretty.-----By the way, this type of music is a bit of a stretch for me. usually I listen to trance, industrial, and Gothic. I got it for the snake, which may even appeal to pop fans. Dont believe me? give it a listen."
1,Recording error.,"Basically I enjoyed the C.D. but the last track is not terminated and ends with about six and a half minutes of silence then a short session of ""noise""."
5,finally a CD that makes me want to listen over and over,I first saw this CD in a local retail store while looking for a Lorienna McK CD... The cover defiantly caught my eye but I didn't purchase it that day. But my mind kept it there and I thought about and wondered about it. I had never heard of this group. So finally I just ordered it. I feel in love with the CD with the very first song. I have probably bought 10 copies and made everyone I know listen to it. And 90% have fallen in love with it as well...Its a must listen to anyone who appreciates music. and is tired of the stuff they are constantly playing on the radio anymore.
1,Misleading,The item descripiton is very misleading. They want you to think you get 54 different colored pencils but what you really get is just one set of colors in 9 groups. Had I know this I would of never ordered. Way over priced for what you get. The packaging is very cheap and won't be any good to store the pencils in. Save your money go to Wal-Mart and buy there you get more colors at a much lower price!!!!
1,Misleading,"I agree with other reviewers - this product is misleading. It should make it clear that there are duplicates of colors and not 54 DIFFERENT colors! This would only be good in a classroom, school or as a gift for multiple kids. No one kid wants many of the same color."
3,Wouldn't have purchased this,The details on the box are too small to read on this but you're actually getting 9 sets of 6 different colors. I should've read the comments before purchasing.
5,crayola,"Our niece is becoming an artist and these crayola pencils were perfect for her. She drew dresses, then designed with her color pencils. It is taking her art to a new level."
3,Missed Thing,"Lavay Smith and her Skillet Lickers are a great group. I can't get enough of the One Hour Mama. I bought Miss Thing as soon as I discovered it was out, anxiously awaited its arrival, and was quickly disappointed. I was expecting vocals, lyrics, and instrumentals as great as the first CD. What I got was good stuff. Over the months, Miss Thing has grown on me, but i don't believe it will ever sound as good as One Hour Mama."
2,Not All That!,"Don't get me wrong this album is decent -- but certainly nothing to rave about. Lavay Smith is constantly revered as the purist swing group in existence, but she and her band are in essence nothing more than a hepped up blues band.Her attempts at covering jump blues material flail wildly, and her voice falls flat.Stick with the bands previous debut, where the instruments better conceal her sophomoric vocals."
5,A fine 2nd release,"This isn't as strong a release as her all standards 1st(One Hour Mama) cd, however this one features Lavay in the same setting and the same band but with more original material, and more jump blues, early R&B, sounding a bit like mid forties Helen Humes. This cd is exellent and features Lavays tight band, jumping and swinging very hard, and yet taking extensive jazz solos throughout. Smith sounds eerilie like Billie Holiday on Now Baby or Never and like Dinah Washington on the opening numner, but otherwise has her own style and identity, but sounding as though she came out of 1946. This cd was a #1 seller at Borders Books & Music Stores for jazz, and also stayed on the jazz billboard charts for a long time, showing that the late 90's Swing revival wasn't just a fad. This cd will be enjoyed by swing dancer and jazz fans everywhere."
3,Funky music,"Lavay sings a great novelty style. It is what we, as musicians,used to call ""Whorehouse Music"". Most of her song titles are unknown to the public and will never reach ""standard"" quality. If you are interested in novelty,get the cd."
1,I wonder why she does not sing with Obbligato.,"Lavay Smith & Her Red Hot Skillet Lickers do not understand the proper swing beat and rhythm and syncopation, so that Lavay sings out of tune and rhythm, the music not on the beat, and she does not sing or cannot sing with the instrumental Obbligatos."
3,not as good as the first,"i love lavay smith. don't get me wrong. i heard her live several years ago and was thrilled when they (finally) released a CD. and 'one hour mama' did not disappoint. one of my all-time favorite albums, no doubt. so as you can imagine, i bought 'miss thing' with much anticipation, but i gotta say: it's not as good as the first. not even close. it's not as catchy, not as soulful, not as timeless as their first. the lyrics leave much to be desired. and she gets a little yodelley at times (too many vocal acrobatics, which don't suit her voice). maybe it's because they wrote some of the tunes. for music lovers, i'd say stick to their first album. you can't go wrong. for lavay, i'd say stick to interpreting the oldies."
3,Not very relevant for the younger bar crowd,"I bought this book years ago when I first started bartending. I was quickly distressed and disappointed by what isn't included- especially on a busy night. Many of the drinks are for older drinkers, ie- Whiskey Sours, Mint Julips, Manhattans, etc.The younger crowd of drinkers- not so much. I'm assuming it must be a regional issue as well- but there isn't even a listing for a basic Texas Margarita. The Mojito in the book doesn't have Sprite, but the local bars here use both Club Soda and Sprite. A lot of currently popular drinks are either not listed or are made completely different in the region that I bartended. For instance, there is no listing for a Check Ride and the Lemon Drop is completely different here than what's in the book. You may be better off learning from experience like I did."
2,on second thought not my first choice or my second,"Bought this book specifically because I needed a recipe for the ""Remus gin fizz"" and was disappointed.While it does cover the basics i.e. the equipment list it has one, but it does not offer any guidance or recommendations on the equipment. for example that the strainer in unnecessary if you know how to use the Boston shaker."
4,pretty dog-on good!!!,"I really enjoy this book. I'm not much of a drinker, so I had no idea there were so many different types of drinks!!! My goal is to try all of them!!!"
4,Good book,"Its got tons of drink recipes - only drawback is no pictures, but I have not found that to be a problem."
1,Who uses sugar cubes?,"With 25 years of experience, I am disappointed in this book. Sugar cubes? Who pours that much dry vermouth in a martini? Robyn is definetly not a bartender. I am tired of people outside the business cashing in on it. Whoever Robyn's sources were, probably felt the same way."
4,A good place to start for a new or training batender.,"I hire and train bartenders for two resteraunts and a night club. This is the only book I currenlty allow my bartenders to use behind our bars. The glossary and ingredient index are very helpful. This book has helped greatly in getting some consistency back among my bartenders. I have run across only a couple of problems with it. The binding. If this book had been spiral bound it would be much easier to actually use while working. Because it is in a paperback format it is more of a reference than a tool. The life expectency of any paperback behind a busy bar is about one week. Glossy or laminated pages would extend it's life. I'm sure that cost is a factor with both of these problems, but any working bartender would gladly spend a few more dollars and consider it an investment."
3,needs spiral binding,"I like the book overall. As with any recipe book, you'll have to customize things to suit your taste. The biggest problem is the binding. It is impossible to mix a drink with the book open at the same time; it WONT stay open. If it were spiral bound, I'd give the book a ""9.5""."
1,you got to read this befor you buy this,well well well its me again bob brxton the cd reviewer guy and let me start whit saying this cd Mtv: The Best of Trl Pop is the s!it if you dont got it get it ok lessin to bob i no i passed devil may cry 1&2 ok not 2 i did not played 2 but played 1 and wow what a game its to hard my dad had to help me but lessin to me maabl on about devil may cry when i shoud be talking about halo yes i got a xbox since last time i reviewed wariowolrd 4 for the gba man this ben so long well we got some catching up to do have you palyed grand theift auto vice city man lets not talk about that ok lets what a game wow no i cant about the cd its good you shoud invest your your money in it well fan you can chach me in my new review of ll cool j 10 till next time bye bye bye in the word of n*sync track 1 on the cd its good im out .......lader homes the end BY BOB BRXTON ....WOW
4,Excellent pop album!,"I've had this CD for 2 years and still play it sometime. But while some of the comments have been negative, you have to understand how much these pop songs were major hits within a 3 to 4-year period. Their videos were shown a lot on MTV's TRL, but the songs were catchy and addictive. This album keeps a consistent flow within its 56 minutes. And one of the rare ones to have boy bands NSYNC, Backstreet Boys, 98 Degrees and O-Town on the same album. Would have liked Britney's Baby One More Time on here, but they might have had to go through record label permission and licensing issues to get it on there. I still love 3LW's No More, Mya's song, Sisqo's song, Willa Ford's song, Souldecision's funky Faded, BBMAK's song and others on here as well as Enrique Iglesias' tasty Be With You. A very fun and entertaining album that will have you dancing!!!!!"
1,A time capsule of bad memories and fads,"I don't even need to tell you how much this cd sucks. Just look at this crap on here, Nsync? The Thong Song? BBMak?This music is so lifeless and bland, but I didn't expect to find anything good on here such as The Smiths or Mindless Self Indulgence.AVOID AT ALL COSTS. JUST STAY AWAY!!!"
1,Is this supposed to be some kind of joke!,"Could somebody tell me whose idea it was to put this useless collection together. This CD is nothing but disposable teenybopper pop-fluff that most of us have now grown out of long ago. The track selection is just laughable especially with insultingly immature krap like ""I Wanna Be Bad"" or ""Thong Song"", both of which are absolutely awful and completely faceless with as much emotion as an empty bowl. It's no wonder noone ever bought this useless CD when it came out as almost every song on here is on other compilations. This CD almost doesn't even deserve to exist. The most laughable cash-in joke I've ever heard of. >:(Buy some Fourplay, Peter Gabriel, Genesis, U2, or Underworld instead."
4,"Sleek bag, fits a Dell too!","I bought this to keep my laptop safe when I put it directly in my back pack when I'm doing some light travel or going on a plane. Outer pocket holds mouse and power cord, but does add bulk. No biggie since I usually just put it in my pack. I have a Dell Studio XPS 17 and it fits good. Top sometimes slides off, but usually stays on pretty well. People like that it stays on, looks cool. Has 2 handles and the velcro closure on top. Dual zippers. Overall quality and function is excellent."
1,wow...,"This was a thrilling book. I read it quickly, waiting to look for the deep motivating things. As an editor, I found many mistakes, and did not seem to find what she was trying to get at. Miss Burton, you tried very well indeed. Like I said, WOW... It was a very good try, and my advice to you from experience is: if one tries to be deep, one stays in shallow waters until they see what it takes to swim deeper.Very good attempt, but I hope your next novels create a better atmospherical sense. I didn't catch your message. GREAT TRY, AND KEEP YOUR BOOKS COMING. WE HOPE TO HEAR MORE FROM YOU!"
1,"Unbelievable, indeed","I found the book to be just that of an eleven-year-old; while not intensely awful, it seemed to be something not particularly good cleaned up by an editor. My vote: if you want a good read, go buy the next Harry Potter."
4,Great book,Husband loved the book. Baby Blues is one of his favorite comics. Makes him laugh out loud. That's rare. Love this book.
3,"Too much junk, but enough spice to keep it going.","I'm not a Stephen King fan, but I must say this is one of his better books. The plot was interesting, suspenseful, and even believable. However, I've always wondered why SK has to put extra words, thoughts, & dangling sentences in his novels. It gets so frustrating to read about EVERY feeling or disjointed thought going through Paul Sheldon's head. Too much of that minute detail and not enough dialogue in my opinion. Mr. King has a very annoying writing style, he writes as if he's jotting down everything going through his mind when he's creating his stories instead of pulling the pieces together to make a more jointed, cohesive tale. So, for writing style I give Mr. King 2 stars and 4 stars for creativity."
3,Breathtaking But Rambling,"There are already so many reviews out here, so I'd keep mine short.What's good: It's one of the best among King's psychology-thrilling type of horror books.(That is, no paranormal activity or formidable creatures). The thrill comes from within human psyches, and he has the ability to make readers actually feel how the protagonist feel in the novel.What's not-good: Still, King's extreme devotion to play word games shows in this book. It's so wordy that you could read through a couple of pages but nothing of the storyline actually goes on. Maybe it's his unique scenario setting but it'd be unquestionably slow-paced. If you've read rather fast-paced novels by writers such as John Saul or Iris Johansen you'd know what I'm talking about."
3,An OK Book,"I read Misery and I thought it was OK. The thing I didn't like about it was that SK put Misery's Return in this book. I thought, ""Why the hell is this here? The only way it is related is that Paul is writting it for Annie."" Another thing I didn't like was that Paul actually published Misery's Return. If I had been through what he had been through, I would destroy that book. All it would do is remind me of the torture I went through. Other than this, the book was good."
4,Misery,"This book is a psychotic ride into the maddening world of obsession. In this book, Stephen King takes you into Paul Sheldon's hell, the home of his tormentor and obsessed fan, Anne Wilkes. He is brought he one winter evening after an auto accident, and Anne discovers his wrecked car and decides to help. I can remember the epigraph for part I of this book, the quote by Fredrich Nietzsche ""When you look into the abyss, the abyss also looks into you."" Because the abyss is where Paul has fallen. I liked this book, because it was both a romance, and a psycho-thriller. We see the relationship between Paul and Annie evolve. She is not only his nurse, but also his jailer, tormentor. I also found this book had some ironic humor in it, like the fact that Anne Wilkes was born on April 1st, 1943. Born on April Fool's day, how ironic ;). My favorite part was when Paul managed to escape from his room and into Anne's den. There he learned about Anne's past. I read this book back in 1986. I enjoyed it alot."
5,I Will Never Forget This Book,"This was the first real book I ever read outside of school, back when I was ten, and it blew me away. It scared the hell out of me, especially the part where Annie ""hobbles"" Paul. It was so good, I would read it for hours and hours and never realize how much time had passed. It took three days to read this outstanding book, and since reading it I have bought and read about fifteen other Stephen King books. There are only three that I can think of that can compare to this book:The Stand, It, and The Tommyknockers, in that order. If you like King, or just really good books, read this. It will change your life."
5,"MISERY THRILLS, CHILLS, DELIGHTS, AND AMAZES","It is my firm belief that Stephen King has produced thus far in his career four literary masterpieces (and another half-dozen or so which come pretty close): THE SHINING, THE STAND, MISERY, and, most recently, HEARTS IN ATLANTIS. (Of those that come close, I'd include 'SALEM'S LOT, THE DEAD ZONE, DIFFERENT SEASONS, PET SEMATARY, DOLORES CLAIBORNE, and THE GREEN MILE.) MISERY is without a doubt (in my opinion) King's greatest horror novel, an excellent exemplar of what constitutes a good horror/suspense tale, a memorable work indeed. I strongly recommend that anyone who enjoys being fraught with terror read this book."
4,King falters at the end,"In a solid but unspectacular horror outing, Stephen King again has caused nationwide outbreaks of insomnia and bed-wetting. This time, it is the isolated Colorado mountain home of one Annie Wilkes. Wilkes is one of Stephen King's most terrifying villains, from her edgy depression to her desperate attempts at conformity. After keeping the reader biting his nails to shreds for the first 2/3 of the book, King loses his touch. The final portions of the book, while still scary, are not up to King's standards. Still, Misery will terrify and entertain King fans. It is an excellent ""first book"" for someone new to King."
3,Digitalization error?,"The story is great, I love Stephen King, but this digital copy is horrible. Its covered in typos end to end! Its unacceptable, if all these typos were in print, someone would be fired quick over it, why is it okay to have all these typos in the e version? If I had known the poor quality of this ebook I wouldn't have bought it, I wouldn't have even taken it for free."
5,Misery,Misery is a great story. I've read the book several times and I've also seen the movie by Rob Reiner numerous times. King vividly portrays all of the characters. It is very suspenseful and the action plays out nicely. You really feel the emotion and the terror. It is a top 5 Stephen King book in my estimation. Highly recommend it.
5,You may have seen the movie but ...,"You may have seen the movie, but you have to read the book! In true Stephen King fashion, Misery will keep you on the edge of your seat, page after bone-chilling page. Annie is the epitome of evil as she plots and keeps her helpless victim, writer Paul Sheldon, trapped in her house of horrors. There is no length she will not go to in order to keep Paul at her side. This is by far one of Stephen King's best work!"
3,A Famous Writers Nightmare,Steven King does he have a fear of meeting a obsessed psychotic fan? I wonder? The writer send fear and I was sweating as I read this thriller. When I go traveling across country I now take my cellular phone because I don't want to meet Annie Wilks. The best Thriller I have read this year is Uri Gellers Dead Cold it seemed more real then Misery
5,One of the Best,"I finished this book in a week when I was 11 . The book is about a demented nurse and the best-selling writer she keeps prisoner in her isolated house. It was suspenseful and the synopsis is intriguing, but he did not have to use all that profanity."
5,Wonderful weaving of characters and environments,"I finished this novel and I thought to myself, ""How in the world does King manage to weave this wonderful mix of protagonist and antagonist feelings?"" His choice of surrounding gives the reader a sense of closed-in claustrophobic images as he pens this magnificant plot around you. Bravo!"
5,Audio Dynamite,"I purchased and read Misery way back when the book was first released. It was, of course, excellent. I also saw the movie adaptation during its initial theater run. Again, excellent. I have been buying audio books to listen to on my commute to work for some time now and am currently listening to Misery. The audio book is read by Lindsay Crouse who delivers a clear, detached narrative and who has an excellent ""Annie voice"" (Annie is the protagonist's homicidal Number One Fan). The audio book has really brought back to me how terrifying this story is. As I said, the movie was excellent but the book is so much more intense. I rank this audio book amongst my favorites. I've found myself actually looking forward to my commute just so I could listen to the day's ""installment!"" I highly recommend this audio book. Buy it and be accompanied to work each day by the twisted, psychotic Annie."
5,King at his finest!,"Misery is a great book. King puts the reader in Paul Sheldon's head and you can actually feel the pain he is going through. Unlike other unrealistic monsters,Annie Wilkes is totally believeable. The movie is alright too,but it leaves out the most suspenseful parts in the book (The amputations,the state trooper that is killed by Annie,and the other troopers that come to investigate).Plus,the movie kills Buster,the likeable sheriff. Not terrifying,but perfectly suspenseful! Well done!"
4,One of my favorites,Annie Wilkes is a terrifying character--what made this book so scary is that all of this could actually happen!
4,"Good, but Distracting Errors","A very good book, one of the best ever, but the grammatical errors are just plain distracting. It took away from the suspense of the plot since i was always trying to figure out what was going on with the punctuation."
3,Surprisingly good,"I thought that Misery would be a really boring book, becuase the whole story takes place in one setting (think 12 Angry Men) and there are only two characters. Well, Stephen King's writing and insight makes the book interesting. Stephen King is probably the only author who can make a story of a man lying in bed for months on end be interesting. Paul Sheldon, a writer, has a bad accident and his car skitters off the road in a snowstorm. He is saved by Annie Wilkes, who just so happens to be his #1 fan. Annie is not a normal person, however. She is a manic depressant and takes alot of her anger out on the helpless Paul. By the end of the book, Paul's body is nearly mutilated by Annies horrific acts of violence. It's a pretty gruesome book at times, but overall it's a good read at about 350 pages."
5,"One of King's best, hands-down","Whew. This is a book I will never forget. I saw the movie first, actually, when I was younger but did not remember much of it. Then when I was a freshman in high school, I got it from the library to read. This truly is a thriller that will keep you at the edge of your seat. I didn't want to put it down and just wanted to keep on reading, this book was SO good. After I rented the movie shortly after that, I was able to further appreciate the awesomeness of this book. In the movie, I'm sure you remember the scene with Paul's feet and a psychotic Annie and a hammer. In the book, what happens is actually quite different - and more gruesome. This novel is a prime example of Mr. King at his best. You just can't go wrong with Misery!"
4,King at his best,"This is how Stephen King should've written all of his books: straight to the point, no nonsense thriller. Too bad most of his other work lacks these qualitys nowdays, but Misery is a must for anyone into the horror genre."
4,"Great story, mediocre reader","This is one of my favorite King novels, one with which he dishes out an incredible horror story without any supernatural trappings. The sense of isolation and fear is almost tangible. The bad thing about this audio version is Lindsay Crouse's unimpressive narration. A lot of audio books have this flaw, a reader who isn't really capable of putting any variation into the voices and moods of the characters and Crouse is guilty of this and that is the reason I'm giving this only 4 stars instead of 5 (the paper version of Misery is definitely a 5). It would have been fantastic if Stephen King would have read this himself or perhaps a great reader like Frank Muller (who did a lot of other King stories) or perhaps Stephen Lang or Kathy Bates (who, after the film, we all think of as Annie Wilkes)."
2,Not His Best Work,"If you are a really big Stephen King fan, you might be a little dissapointed with this book. I think it was alright, but it was really slow and dragged you through most of the book. By reading the back, it really sounds like a good read, but the only parts of this book that I really enjoyed were the exciting parts where Paul Sheldon was in danger, and the ending. I found this book boring and slow and I would not really recommend it. There are plenty more Stephen King books that are much more exciting than this particular book. I think it is a good piece of writing, but I don't think it is really that good of a book. I would suggest that you pick up a different Stephen King book before you read this one because most of his other books are a lot better than this one."
3,its ok i guess,"this is one of my favorite steven king books.99.9% of the reason is hes not killing children the whole way through like in most of his other books/movies.and im not talking about teenagers who are out drinking and having sex,i mean little kids this guy always kills or does horrible things to in his books/movies.anyhow,this story is all about a writer who is injured and kidnapped by a psycho fan.the fan is a nurse who uses pain killer addiction and physical torture to get him to write another book to her favorite series.its very demented.and whats worse is theres really psycho people out there who would do something like that.like tim burton says......""ive always found real people far scarier than any monster ""."
2,Misery,"I didn't like the book Misery written by Stephen King because it draged on until the very end. There were some parts in it that were very discusting. The story draged on and it made it confusing cecause you didnt't know if he was dreaming or it was really happening. The oher thing I didn't like about this book is it curses to much, and it had hardley any kind of action till the end. I wouldn't recommend thios bokk to anyone."
1,A book that's easy to put down and walk away from.,"Misery is perhaps the worst book I have ever read. From cover to cover, nothing but predictability. Paul sheldons attempt to decieve Annie, and her naivety to fall for it every time got very old. By the time I was halfway through I wanted one of them to die. It didn't matter which one it was. If you are new to the Stephen King scene, pick a different book. I would hate for you to get the wrong idea about this writer by reading this book."
4,It was very suspenseful and has lots twisting turns to it.,"The book is definetely one that you will want to read. It has a great plot and you won't want to put it down. You become so involved in the main characters thoughts that you are soon thinking along with him what will happen next. I think anyone who is interested in a book that you will be able to get into and a little scare, read this."
2,Great Ending-Nothing Else,"The ending to Misery is absolutly hoffiying. It made me cringe. It, however, is the only good part about the book. The story doesn't even start rolling until Annie takes the ax to Paul. I am a very big Stephen King fan, but Misery could have really been something. He has a lot of great books, but this isn't one of them."
5,GET READY! SHE CAN'T BE DEAD,"If you are not married, stop everything and just read this book before you decide. 'MISERY' will give you the insight to human nature. You will be able to tell whether your girl-friend is carzy or not. You know, being crazy is not an extraordinary thing. Remember, Annie is not dead. What an Annie my ex-girlfriend was!!!!"
5,Amazing,This book is breath-taking..On page 1 the action begins. We start with a man (Paul Sheldon) in a bed trying to think how he got in this situation.After a car reck women named Annie picks him up and gives him shelter.We see that she is Paul's biggest fan.Poor Pauly because this women is crazy.Paul writes these books and the main character is Misery.Annie is a fan for Misery and lives for her.Paul kills off Misery in the last book and this is the worst mistake of his life.This is where we see Annie go crazy.She wants paul to bring her back to life.Paul doesn't want to.But Annie has ways of getting him too.Like a needle and an axe and if that sounds bad she can really get nasty.I really recomened this book.It is a suspen es novel and get you caught up in it.
3,"GREAT ENDING, THAT'S IT.","Well, personally I am a Stephen King fanatic. I love his works, especially the Shining. But Misery was a real MISERY to read.. I fell asleep countless times.. I stopped counting after a hundred or so. The only good thing about this book is the ending of it, which was only the real SCARY and THRILLING part of the book. Okay book overall, though."
5,"Very, very frightening.","I found that Misery was probably the scariest, most frightening book I have ever read. In fact, having been a Stephen King fan for years, I felt pretty comfortable reading just about anything he's written. This book is definitely not for the faint of heart."
4,great book,"This book started a little bit slow but when it got going it was hard to put down. You'll read the first few sentances and say ""I don't have a clue what this means, this doesn't make any sence. I thought that i was going to put it down. But I read on and everything I read fell together and it all maked sence. (somewhat)(stephen king can never make full sence, but that what is so good about his work. He really makes you think) Please read this book. It was the first book that I ever read. It got me introduced to stephen king. stephen king is a very good auther. Read this book and i think you'll agree."
5,Now here's a book...,"that was better than the movie in every way. I first read this book in 1989 and it was an absolute page-turner from the very beginning. As the story unfolded we found out about a writer in serious pain after crashing his car somewhere in Colorado, a nurse who took him in who seemed quite competent except for one thing-it soon became very obvious that she was absolutely crazy. So good was King's description of his wounded writer-held-prisoner that I as a reader almost began to feel what he was feeling. I had to keep putting the book down and reminding myself that this was ""just a story.""This one is terror and suspense all the way and the many detours the story takes en-route to its dramatic conclusion only add to the already richly engossing tale it is. Buy this one and be ready for one heck of a ride! A word of warning: you will never view chainsaws, lawnmowers, and birthday cakes in the same way."
3,Well written book,"Not Stephen Kings greatest book but it still was a pretty good read, I skipped over reading the actual misery story by paul sheldon. because it was unneccessary to read and tbh i find those sort of stories boring. overall worth reading for the price, but it is a rather dull story."
4,Good book.,"This book was good but I don't know why it got higher ratings than his lesser known books like Desperation and Rose Madder.It's about a writer who gets writernapped by a crazy woman.He's her #1 author and she uses him as a ""pet writer.""This book is worth reading (like all his books) but if you want really cool books of his that aren't as popular, get Desperation and Rose Madder, they were more fun in my opinion."
3,"I like Stephen King books, but this just a bit too bloody for me to give it five stars.","I give this book three and a half stars but as you may know, that can not be done, so three stars have to suffice. There was a lot of unneeded gore in this book. I perfer the Rob Reiner film over this because it tones down the violence and gives a more satisfying ending. But still, it is a good read and worth checking out by Stephen King fans."
5,This Bitch Is Crazy !,"Annie Wilkes is off the chain. You all know that this book is about Paul Sheldon who gets into a car accident because he was all buzzed up with don pariogone. Then this psychotic biach (Annie) takes Paul and ""nurses"" him if thats what you wanna call it.Then she dause stuff to him that you need to find out by reading this amazingly written book. If you've seen the movie then you stillhave to read this book it's that good!"
4,"Terror,Tension and MISERY!!!!!!!","This book contains all of the key elements that makes a noval great but also opens new doors for the writer. This is the first time that Stephen King introduces an aspect to his work that was not present in his previous novals:Simplicity. This is not to say that this noval is not worth reading in fact quite the opposite. This new factor does not take away from this noval in the slightest,in fact it adds to the directness of the characters and the plot. This noval makes it easy to relate to the characters and what they are going through,where as in previous novals the characters seemed distant and inhuman. Altoghther a great read,as well as a perfect first time reader's first introduction to King's world."
5,The best King book to date,"I have never given a ten before and I've reviewed many books, but this is one of the very best. Annie Wilkes is the best looney ever written (and Kathy Bates won the oscar for her role as her). If you haven't read it, DO SO"
2,Too many typos in Kindle version,"Good story, but it was frustrating to read through all those typos in Kindle edition. There must've been more than a hundred of them."
2,**KINDLE review**,Great story - TERRIBLE TRANSLATION TO THE KINDLE.Way too many spelling errors!!! Missplaced periods all over!!! I paid $3.99...I guess you get what you pay for.
4,A Great Story From A Modern Master,"Wow! I watched the movie when I was younger, but the film is no match to the masterful story that King has crafted. Despite taking place in only a couple of rooms, King manages to enthrall readers with his use of interesting characters and looming suspense. With mixed reviews on most of Kings recent contributions, it is nice to have the older stories to remind us what a remarkable ""story-writer"" he is."
5,love his older stuff,"Hooked me right from the beginning! Literally couldn't put it down until I finished.. like that ""gotta have it moment""."
1,"Dull, uneventful, worthless","The main problem with this book is that you just don't care about the fates of the characters. Sure, you've got all the wham-bam gruesome action, some well-described scenes of torture, but even during these sequences where your interest should be at it's high-point, the mind tends to drift, to imagine alternate scenerios, to develop a better telling of the story itself. Every dead-end page after every drudging leaf of cheap, sanitized paper it goes on and on and on and who the hell cares in the end? Stephen King has never been a great writer, just a man with a fertile imagination and enough ability to get by with a fully created world. But, when the story lacks depth or incident--like Misery--then all that scamming and lying to conning for prestige is gone and you're left with a hack churning out yet another volume of garbage."
1,True Misery,"True misery is reading this novel. By the time he'd written this, King had succumbed to the ""my every word is golden"" delusion, so the thing is much larger than it needed to be. After reading this because I promised a friend I'd do it (oh, what we do for pretty women)I decided that even 180 pages would've been too long. The conclusion is unsatisfactory because some of the cast of characters survive."
1,worst King book,"This book is terrible. I don't know about everyone else, but a story about a guy recovering in a pyscho's house isn't my idea of a griping story. I suggest anything else."
4,creepy and hysterical,"Between the brutal and the hysterical, King manages to capture the madness of not only writing, but every day life, as seen thru the eyes of both the insane and the slowly going insane. More disturbing and graphic than the fine film version, the violent scenes here are more repellent, altho the riding lawn mower encounter had me laughing with over the top delight. Did King go too far here? probably, but you can't fault his imagination or his wicked ability to create real characters out of the most extreme circumstances. Despite his penchant for the cheesey pop culture reference, this is still a delicious little treat that will leave you a bit drained in the end. Where else can you go after a blow torch and an electric knife? How about a romance heroine covered by killer bees? (If these are possible spoilers, I apologize. if you've read the book already, you'll know what they mean)."
5,Hilarious romantic comedy!!,"Hayley Parrish wins an all-expenses paid wedding, but she doesn't have a groom! This is one of the funniest books I've read all year."
2,Gem is a royal pain in the [rear],"The first few pages of this book started out good but quickly went down hill. I found this story unbelievable. Gem quickly got on my nerves. She is an obsessive, annoying brat. How can she still be in love with Chase after he had been gone for 5 years! Considering he was probably around less then a year before he left. Apparently this girl led a sheltered life. Gem is desperate and irritating and fell in love with someone she hardly knew. And then she forced him to marry her. The only reason why I gave this book 2 stars was because it kept me interested enough to finish it and find out how Chase eventually told her he loved her."
4,Surprisingly shock-absorbing,"I found this shoe quite stable and surprisingly shock-absorbing. I usually buy my adidas size 10, but this was a tad larger than other adidas size 10. So beware and buy it 1/2 a size smaller than you usually buy your adidas.A very good running shoe overall!"
3,AutoLISP in Plain English,A lot of basic informations were left-out and some functions were not clearly expressed and it was not in plain English.
4,Ain't nothing like the real thing...,"I've watched these guys progress from three strangers to three of the hardest working, tightest jamming people I know. The songs are instant classics that stick to your soul. I just caught them at Nightingales in Manhattan at the PCP show. All the bands were great. Anyway, buying this C.D. is money extremely well spent and even though I'm family and helped with this album I tell no lies!"
2,Harrad Experiment (1973),"I would have rated this video higher except for the fact that about 6 minutes of the original film has been cut. I saw the original release and there are nude scenes and audio censorship from the original. I noticed on IMDB that the original was 97 minutes, but there was a 91 minute UK release so this must be the UK release. I wish that the US release was available."
1,Never a good movie...,"...but more of an acceptable way to get nudity on screen in a ""responsible"" manner. Amazon's streaming video of it makes it worse. It is grainy and washed out. It was shot on a low budget and lacked much aesthetic value forty years ago, but now it is unwatchable."
5,The only way to go,"Pigtail connectors like this are the only way to go. This one fit perfectly into the Subaru connector and each wire, besides matching the usual color code for motor vehicles, has each wire labelled."
5,This Went #1 in the Americana chart the week after Johnny Cash&9inch nails,"Unfortunately it raced up the charts so fast we didnt have CD's available for 3weeks.This collection is a celebration of two cultures. Classic Country from one of it's founders( Hank Cochran has had 8 thousand songs recorded and discovered Willie Nelson).Billy Don Burns is like a modern day, motorcycle gang version of James Dean with a guitar slung over his shoulder, and a lifetime of adventures in the form of songs.For people who live way out on the edge, or for those who just want to hear about it from the experts, THIS ONE IS FOR YOU!! It's hard to find great music these days, but these guys did, and it's on this CD. Greg Kane"
2,not a good movie.,"This is a poor attempt at a teen sex comedy (e.g. American Pie). The stilted and predictable dialogue, poor direction and generally low quality means I didn't see much to make one laugh. On top of the general low level of the movie it is basically a string of uncreative jokes based on mean spirited jabs at stereotypes of the working class, women, and others. It lacks what I would consider the heart of good films in this genre- empathy for the characters."
1,Movie review,This is one of the worst movies I have ever watched. I do not recomend it to anyone. It was just plain silly.
1,Bad Acting Bad Directing,"Once in a while I don't mind watching a low budget poorly scripted, directed and acted movie but this one will leave you wishing that you could get the time back you spent watching it, at least with a DVR I was able to skip ahead over some of the scenes that were too unbearable to watch."
3,Not to bad,Kind of a funny white trash kinky movie. Maybe me a laugh a little and a little... :-) Worth the time or two to watch.
1,HORRIBLE,"THIS WAS A HORRIBLE MOVIE, SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN MADE! I HAVE SEEN BETTER IN SILENT FILMS BACK IN THE DAY"
1,upset,"to be honest this movie was horrible the only nude scene is the begining for like two minutes when the girl takes a bubble bath, the movie wasnt even funny"
3,Beter movies,"To whom it may coner,It was a good funny movie. But it wasnoting abot the boy in the movie like it said. Thnk you Peter"
3,"Not great, but somewhat entertaining","This is not a great movie, but it isn't a bad movie either. There is some entertainment value to it. This movie serves as a good introduction to viewers for future comedies that would follow in its formula like American Pie. There are a few moments the movie does get a little slow, but it does pick back up the pace to make for a great entertainment value."
3,"Great film , great transfer, poor labelling","I first ran across this film in the mid-80's when I was rediscovering Hammer films. It is probably the most unique of the gothic horror films that Hammer is known for, being both a swashbuckler and a vampire flick. The film was great, nice crisp colors, and great sound. This should make it a 5-star review, right? NO!The top banner of the keepcase says ""Widescreen Collection"". I was prepared to watch one of my favorite Hammer films in letterbox glory. It only plays as a fullscreen (1.33:1 aspect ratio). I will be returning mine to Wal-mart for a refund."
1,"CORNY, RIDICULOUS, SILLY MOVIE.",DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS STUPID MOVIE. IT IS AS CORNY AS CORNY GETS.
4,Captian Kronos Vampire Hunter,"Decent vampire flick. Different from the norm. Caroline Munro...oh wow!!! I think women from the 70s, I don't know what it is about them, are the sexiest women of all times."
4,Three Musketeers Meets Dracula,Capt.Kronos Vampire Hunter has a good mix of sword fights andvampire mythos.Hammer Horror outing about a 19th centuryswashbuckler out to save the world from the undead.
4,"Captain Kronos: ""The Good, The Bad and the Ugly"" revisited","Admirably scored by Laurie Johnson and an interesting adaptation of the usual Vampire story.You would expect this to be terrible because of the lack of Hammer regulars like Lee or Cushing but I must admit that this movie holds it's own with a set of no-names, probably due to a well written script and decent direction. The characters remind you of Clint Eastwood ""Man with No Name"" pictures with bad guys who light matches on the backs of hunchbacks, etc. Here we have the usual set of nasty barroom boys who try to start fights with every newcomer and they meet their match after...what else?... insulting a hunchback and losing 3 to 1 odds against Captain Kronos and his swordplay. Similar to Buffy the Vampire Slayer, this movie could have been a prototype for the future ""Scooby crew"". Unusual and somewhat entertaining. Certainly for any Vampire fan."
5,Captain Kronos - Vampire Hunter,"My all-time favourite vampire film! Set in Germany after (I think) the Seven Years War, when Captain Kronos, whose family were killed by vampires, sets out to kill as many as he can, accompanied by a young woman he finds along the way. A wonderfully moody and atmospheric Hammer Horror."
4,Just what I was looking for...,Just what I was looking for. I had searched every specialty kitchen supply store and every Asian food store in my area and none of them carried any item like this.I'd had to use a metal bowl before I found this which sushi recipes tell you strictly not to use. There was a noticeable improvement in my sushi rice while using this product.I also liked how the base of the bowl pops out for easy cleaning.My only complaint was that the base of the bowl did bow upon my first usage. I had to set a fairly heavy pot on it after cleaning in order to flatten it out.Other than that I had no complaints. The company that shipped it got it to me very quickly. It worked well and overall was well worth the purchase.
5,Awesome!,This is a one-of-a-kind book. I found a copy of this bookin a thrift store in 2001. If you are interested in healthand fitness this is a good place to start. I love how theauthor is so enthusiastic about fresh vegetable and fruitjuices. Very positive book about taking care of our health.
2,An interesting science book by a reporter,"For the most part, the author seems to have pretty good information for the time of the book's printing, but for anyone who wants to read this book on purely scientific terms, be warned; there are several places where the book goes awry, for example: the author states that tracks of tyrranosaurus indicate that it was a solitary animal, occasionally hunting in pairs. Problem: no tracks of a t. rex have been discovered to date, a decade and a half after the writing. Aside from that and a few other points, though, the book is good reading."
2,"Very cool, but not for the fish","The shark reef is very cool looking, has very good instructions and is beautifully constructed. However the three sharks that they give you to put in with the live fish, really crowd the other fish- they didn't look happy. So we took the sharks out and they were happier, but 2 days later the larger fish died. 2 smaller fish remain, but based on what I read about aquariums, smaller aquariums are difficult to maintain because the PH levels can get off easily due to excess food or excess waste produced by the fish. I worry that my son will get disappointed if we keep losing fish..."
1,Fish Killer Aquarium,"We bought this for my son for Christmas, on the conditon that he never put fish in it, since the reviews said it killed fish. That worked fine until he won a fish at the school carnival. Of course it had to go in with the sharks. So with freshly treated water and a prayer, we put the fish in. The next day it was very listless and lying along the bottom. After checking the reviews, I saw one where the person removed the fish and they recovered. So we've taken the beta out and are waiting to see if it will survive. I still would rate this aquarium 1 star for cool looks and lights, but it's very noisy and I believe it kills fish."
1,Forget it,"This is simply a fish torture device! It will kill fish quickly. No filtration, etc. So, if you want your child to learn about losing a loved one.....get this. If you want your child to have pet fish, go out and get a proper aquarium so they will live and prosper. Do not by this product!Smarter Grampa and Grandma"
1,True reviews,"We were so excited when we saw this fish tank. It is so cute. My son had a happy and healthy two week old carnival goldfish that we couldn't wait to put in it. We went right out to get him a friend as well. Within 24 hours the new fish died. We had the water tested bought water conditioner and bought another new fish. Within 24 hours again, it died. The original goldfish was still alive and kicking but seemed to be running out of steam. Heartbroken and perplexed as to why this was happening, I went online and did some research. I was AMAZED at the reviews I found and am stunned that everyone has had the same results! I immediately moved ""goldie"" to a new home. Thanks to all your reviews we still have our beloved carnival fish!"
5,Favorite novel,"I first read this book nearly 40 years ago when I was in high school. It was one of my favorites then and I have continued to thoroughly enjoy this marvelous and beautifully written story time and again now in my middle-age years. It is just as thrilling and exciting now as it was four decades ago. Truly Mr. Howard Pyle was a great and wonderful writer of adventure stories. I would recommend this book to any. It has marvelous morals that are encouraged. It shows great courage in the face of tremendous adversity. It shows what one needs to do to get on top even when in adverse conditions. all of us would do well to show the grit, determination, and goodness of heart Myles Falworth displays in this book."
4,Men of Iron is a Winner,"Men of Iron is a WinnerClassic, old time adventure that would be great for kids or adults. It is strong enough to be entertaining for most age groups."
4,Great adventure for young adults,"I read this book as a young teenager, and not only will I never forget it, I'll buy a copy for each of my nephews. Though the reader won't know it for many years after reading it, this book contains the seeds of what the word 'ethics' used to mean: the values which you live by and uphold. Everyone develops their own set of ethics, and Pyle shows some honorable and laudable ones to start with."
2,Men of Iron The making of a young man to a knight,"This was a time whena young man who had to be carefully taken in the steps of knightlyhood. With the days going by, he had o fight his father's foe.I would recommend this book to a friend of mine who would like to read classsic books, and hopefully he/she would find this book enjoying. I wouldn't say the boook was totally boring, however, it could have been a bit more exciting. It always counts to the persons' opinon."
2,"nice pictures, but really made for the typical american","I feel like this book was made for the average traveler with heaps of money to spend. Not many cheap options. Plus there was no coverage of off the beaten track places. Only the main cities and sights. The pictures were quite lovely, though...My advice: If a trip to Japan is in your future, pick up Lonley Planet's Japan. And if your Japanese is non-existant, I hear that LP also publishes a good phrasebook.If you have heaps of money to spend and are the type of person who likes organized tours and planned itenaries, buy this book. If not, skip it."
4,Great pictures and stories but highly culture-opinionated,"I picked this book up to do some research on a possible future trip to Japan. Wanted to see, with pictures and stories, what there is to see. This book is great for that, but I keep getting distracted by the sometimes highly-opinionated (albeit fascinating) views on Japanese culture and life. Wasn't expecting such editing from a general guidebook not advertised for its opinions. Without these distractions, I'd give the book 5 stars as an advance-research book. If I had been Japanese, I might have returned it long ago (and every time I read another section, the thought still occurs to me). Can't say much more than this since I haven't been to Japan myself and haven't finished the whole book yet."
3,Great voice,"For some resn, this disc is strangely unappealing. The voice is of course great, but when she made this record, she was rather short on communication, an just seems like a reading of rather dull music. I would pass"
3,TOP level progressive keyboardist from sweden,"If you like keyboard wizards, try this one. Swedish prog musicians are respected since the seventies ant this guy made a good record in 1980. worth listening."
2,not so whistling tea kettle,"After looking for months and months for a tea kettle with a harmonica whistle (train sound) that doesn't cost an arm and a leg, I found this one. I was so excited.Sometimes it whistles, sometimes it doesn't. Also, there is not a tight seal on the lid. I am disappointed but exhausted from the long search and would rather have a ""sometimes train sounding"" kettle than one that won't do it at all. .. so I kept it.Maybe when I am rich again, I'll go get the other one ...but who would spend $75 on a tea kettle? Something seems just wrong about that with people starving in Burma and all.."
4,Solid Bop,"The flute in hard bop. Most love it or hate it. Very difficult instrument to be indifferent towards. It's sounds carries such a distinct essence. Often dates a recording, perhaps unfairly.Yusef Lateef is the flautist on this record, in addition to his tenor duties. Lee Morgan pops up on most tracks, as does Milt Hinton. We even get Jimmy Garrison for a take. And, of course, McCoy Tyner warms the piano bench the whole time...Solid line-up, lovely engineering and production, strong hard bop writing and arranging from bandleader and trombonist Curtis Fuller. Pay special attention to 'Be Back Ta-Reckla' and 'Judyful'."
2,Rock Opera - Not Symphonic Metal,"There is some good singing here, and some ok music, but the metal aspect is minor and out of place. Imagine Celine Dion doing a Disney movie soundtrack with double bass drumming, but with little to no guitars. This band is nothing like Lacuna Coil or Evanescence, and nothing like Dimmu Borgir - who are real symphonic metal kings."
5,Six Stars out of Five - It's that good!,"If I could give this album six stars, I would. This CD is nothing short of phenomenal from the symphonic opening of Hunab K'u, to the strength and beauty of the Quietus, to the last note of Consign to Oblivion. A true masterpiece. As with most of the earlier Epica recordings, I had a hard time finding a copy but I finally did and it was worth every penny. Music doesn't get much better than this. In my opinion, this is a ""must have"" CD for anyone who likes to listen to music rather than just hear it. You can't put this one on and do something else. You have to stop and listen to it from start to end - and then start over. Six stars and then some!"
3,"Good album, but the weakest part of Epica's discography","This is a pretty good album, but I personally prefer Epica to be heavier. Simone's vocals are great here, and there are some really strong songs such as ""Quietus"", ""Solitary Ground, ""Another Me"", ""Dance of Fate"", and ""Trois Verges""."
3,Not Their best...,"I really love ""The Phantom Agony"" & ""The Divine Conspiracy"" But for some reason I just cannot get into the album in between the two (This one.)It seems like the writing of it was very rushed. The music is a little weaker and less imaginative than on their other albums.I would not say this is bad, but nothing stands out on it and every songs seems to be the same sounding. I'm not bagging it out, it's still Epica, it just seems a lot weaker. The only song that I would say on this album that is really good is the final 9 minute track.All the rest are ""good"" in a very average way. I think if you're a fan of one of the others but haven't heard this, download it first before spending your money on it.Having said that, It is good and a lot better than other stuff out there, I just think this album is really a dissapointment for a band this good."
4,Powerful,"Another fine effort by one of my new favorite bands, Epica. This one has less of the cookie monster growls than either Phantom Agony or Divine Conspiricy, therefore it all sounds a bit more accessible. However, there does seem to be a small price in that the music, while still great, doesn't seem quite as strong as Epica's other efforts. The difference is very small indeed. Perhaps those growls are the key...hmmmm..."
3,Water's Journey,I ordered both DVD's and enjoyed them both. Not sure it was worth buying them rather than renting. But I wanted my daughter who runs a nonprofit about water in CA to have them in her Community Water Center library. I recommend everyone see either or both of these DVD's to graphically understand how we are all connected underground. Water is so important and we take it so for granted.Pattie
4,Tastes Good but bad Ingredient,"I really like the taste and the cute bottle. I would put it all over alot more things if it didn't have xantham gum in it, which is a lab created product made from genetically engineered bacteria. Who knows what that stuff is doing to your system and reproductive capabilities down the line? I have used this stuff when I was dining out and was very impressed with the flavor. It tastes good on burritos. I just would not want to buy it to use every day because of the chemical ingredient. Maybe they should try organic cornstarch or arrowroot powder to thicken it instead."
3,Good coverage of topic,"I find the concepts introduced in the book such as categorisation of business rules, and the worked examples using a few products very useful.However, I wish the book can be less verbose, with less repetition of the same concepts (such as continuously expounding on the advantages of business rules approach) throughout the whole book. They are distracting and not necessary. The book could have been more concise.This is a topic worth exploring into and I hope some of UML/MDA efforts can incorporate the ideas here."
2,Very disappointing,"I bought this book based on some of the enthusiastic reviews here but was very disappointed. I think people who see rules engines as the next big thing and are very excited about it may be enthusiatistic about this book because it pushes that line very hard. However, there is very little in this book that reflects hard practical experience or that is likely to surprise an experienced software designer with a basic understanding of rules engines. Good books on this subject are still waiting to be written.Instead of this book I would recommend reading ""Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software"" by Eric Evans and the documentation for whatever rules systems you are considering."
2,Good for 2 men's bikes,"Purchased the HR8000 based on the positive reviews. Unit is solid, easy to connect to my hitch. However, loading any 3 bikes on it requires expert Tetris skills. I gave up after spending more than 2 hours at it. Even if I could have gotten the pedals and handlebars and such to play nice, the spacing of the forks is too wide for a girls' mountain bike. Spoke with Hollywood's customer service, they suggested purchasing a special adapter. The adapter was expensive relative to the cost of the carrier itself, and from the description I was concerned whether this would securely hold a bike on a bumpy road (such as any SF Bay Area Hwy). Fortunately, Amazon accepted the return at no charge."
1,junk bike rack,bought this rack because i was told it was the best made got it assembeled per directions placed bikes on it first time straps broke on 2 of the 4 bikes on the rack and trashed my wifes new bike and tore the seat on my sons have not been able to talk to anyone with customer service was hung up on once!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Will not fit most bikes.,"This rack is sturdy and well built, but has a major flaw. The support arms are too wide to accomodate most modern bikes. Even with the top tube adapter (which I also purchased) there is still not enough clearance to fit smaller frame bikes on the rack. I'm not talking about children's bikes, but smaller frame adult bikes. The rubber cradles help cushion and secure the bike, but they are also bulky and it is difficult to fit the bikes over them. If you have large frame bikes with straight top tubes the rack works fine, but with the modern road bikes and mountain bikes with sloping top tubes the fit is difficult, even with the adapter. If the support arms were about 3 to 4 inches closer together the rack would be perfect, but the way it is now it's almost useless for many bikes."
2,ehhh....,"Man...i've tried and tried...but Mortician sucks...I mean Musically they are extremely talented, the samples kick ass, but the vocals are terrible and every song sounds the same...do yourself a favor and pick up a Gorgoroth album, Berzerker, or even some Impaled Nazarene...but put the Mortician album down..cuz the only thing you will get is this feeling that you want your money back..."
4,Nice sequel to White Apples,"I'm a big Jonathan Carroll fan, ever since I readThe Land of Laughs: A Novel. Carroll manages to mix mundane with mystical in a very charming way. Glass Soup continues whereWhite Applesleft the story of Vincent, Isabelle and their child messiah. This makes recommending this book very straightforward: if you've read White Apples and enjoyed it, Glass Soup is a must read book. If you haven't read White Apples, start there.That said, I think this is quite a worthy sequel to White Apples. The story is quite as odd and profound as it was before. Carroll weaves the events beautifully, as the main characters travel around Vienna and cross the borders between life and death. There's odd humour, curious characters, and fairly deep thinking. The opening of the book is delightfully surreal."
3,"Well, i don't know where to start about these loyal fans...","Now look, i'm going to try to be as honest as i can put it. For one, this is not the same ""Pochy"" that literally exploded all of the merengue charts back in the early 90's. To me, this album is a cold hard fact about he has lost his edge (somewhat) the musical fire that has originally made him famous. Now don't get me wrong, on this c.d. there are some signs of him trying very hard to make his comeback. But lets face it, his ""tiguerajes"" just is'nt enough anymore to compete with todays types of merengues. In other words, ""HE'S A WASHED UP HAS BEEN""... Just like Mike Tyson was in boxing, Pochy Familia is the same in the merengue... Yes, there are a few good songs that this album has to offer, but let's be real people, for all of the hard efforts, this just is'nt the same cocoband from before... do the comparison yourself, inbetween all and every one of his albums he ever made. and then you'll see what i mean..."
5,Pochy Familia,"Pochy is back where he started,at the top. This album is excellent and I recommended to anyone who wants quality and good sound."
5,Great idea.,This is great for coloring fans of all ages. I know how hard it is to find good skin tone markers myself. The top on the market are the Copic which are about nine bucks a marker. And just to high a price to pay for most of us. So these are a great alternative.
2,Save Your Money-A Failed Experiment,"All hail John Mayall, but no one's perfect.This album demonstrates the truth of that cliche.I bought this record blind in high school because I knew of Mayall's reputation and I stupidly didn't want to have the same Mayall albums all my friends had. The title of this album is accurate-Mayall is recalling his youth from middle age.A good deal of his youth appears to have been spent masturbating and fantasizing about sex.That's inescapable-the lyrics of ""Wish I Knew a Woman"" frankly describe an adolescent Mayall""jacking off pretending I'm the lover of them all""as he stares at the pinups hanging on his walls.The tunes are flat and the songs simply don't swing.This isn't rock and it fails as blues. Sorry I can't find a way to sugarcoat this, but the album stinks.I'm sure Mayall would be the first to admit that in his career he's put out some duds.This album doesn't come off at all.Grab ""Bluesbreakers"" or one of his other classics instead."
4,Evolution Well Explained!,"Bylinsky aptly chronicles evolution and gives believable and understandable options and alternatives to man's beginning and ongoing evolutionary process. Although Life in Darwin's Universe is 20 years old now the text is quite applicable and gives credence to current technology and scientfic endeavors. The text is written for the everyday reader and is appropriate for the younger reader also. Bylinsky's LIfe in Darwin's Universe is interesting, factual, prophetic, and well worth the time to read. I would personally enjoy an updated version and follow-up on current and prior observations and predictions. I enjoyed your book Dr. Bylinsky"
5,"Very, Very Moving","I have read many books about the holocaust, but this one is special to me. After having the honor of actually meeting the author and hearing her story told first-hand (twice), I felt like I had to get her book. I did, and it changed me. Reading it was an experience which was almost too difficult for me and yet, I didn't want it to end.It is written like a story -you go through everything she goes through, you sort of relive it with her. That is why, when you finish the book, you feel like she is your best friend. I wish she was."
4,Hmmmm...,"Since there was a series of albums in the early 1960s, all with the same title (""A Meiga Elizete""), it would be great if the song titles were included, so potential customers could know which record they would be getting. I've heard the first album in the series (which has ""Vai Querer"" and ""Projecao"" as the first two tracks...) and it is quite nice!"
1,disapointed,I have his album December which I love this one however is not good I was actually relieved when a few of the songs were finished
5,Another 5 star outing from the Excellent Solo Pianist,"Winter Into Spring, by George Winston, is another fine offering from this gifted pianist. IF you are new to Mr. Winston, welcome, you are in for a treat. If Mr. Winston is old hat to yopu, enjoy the opportunity to own these once fantastic albums of now even greater CDs. Simply another 5 star CD from Mr. Winston. This is a CD to put on in the background and play all day."
1,Winter,"My reiki therapist recommended this CD so I bought it. Booo.. Being a music lover and a pianist, I would say don't get this...it lacks substance and melody."
3,Winter Into Spring,"I always enjoy George Winston's work. It never fails to transport me to a blissful place--although I must plead guilty to being a piano enthusiast. I have many of Winston's CDs, my favorite being ""December."" So although ""Winter Into Spring"" cannot begin to compare to ""December"", I have enjoyed it immensely."
4,Winter Into Spring,"What can one say about George Winston that hasn't already been said. He is a true artist. For sure he has varied his musical style with the years. This CD selection harkens back to the ""December"" fare. It too evokes serene thoughts and a tranquil mood that opens up to the dawn of new life with spring."
5,Wonderful Product,Both my dogs fur is very soft and they do not shed very much. People always comment on how soft and shinny their coats are. I free feed my dogs and put this in a bottle with a pump and put one squirt in each bowl.
1,Don't waste your money,"My husband and I are awaiting the birth of our first baby. I am so excited and anxious which makes me a sucker for products like this. I bought the listener at 5 months. The only noises you can hear are stomach noises and that's only when there is no static. I am now 8 months and have still failed to hear the heartbeat. I can't tell you the countless nights I have laid in bed listening and trying to hear the heartbeat. The microphone and cd are nice. I have used those. But overall, the set is a big waste of money. I was very disappointed."
1,A Star is too much credit for this product...,"I bought this item and tried to hear my baby's heart beat but the only thing i got was a little thump, which if you read the manual it says that a kick sounds like a thump, well no it wasn't my baby kicking; it's the sound of your finger holding down the activate button(incase your wondering, even in a quiet room it picks up any little noise that happens outside your window etc...). I put it over my heart and it did detect it then i put it on my thigh and GUESS WHAT I HEARD?? THUMP THUMP, unless my baby's kicks echos throughout my whole body than i would've kept this product and treasured it, but in my opinion (take it if you want thats whay it's an opinion)I would buy something else that'll come to more use for you or your unborn baby or other children you might have."
2,Thumbs Down,"My husband and I are very disappointed with this product. We cannot hear the baby's heartbeat at 33 weeks, we can only hear my heartbeat. We bought this product to do what it is advertised to do, and it doesn't. We sometimes use the music and headphones, hopefully my baby enjoys that aspect of it."
1,A complete waste of money and time.,"A real disappointment. We got our hopes up and tried for months to hear the heartbeat. Now 29 weeks, still nothing but horrible static and every creak of the movements of the cords and my hands! impossible to avoid! If im lucky, the only thing heard over the static is my digestive system. woo hoo! anyways, this thing picks up conversations of people in the next room as well as any TV or music playing in the house. Such a let down! and we're mad that we wasted our money."
2,Doesn't pick up heartbeat well,I am 34 weeks pregnant and have only heard his heartbeat three times with it. It amplifies every movement of the cord and the clicking on/off button is very loud. I do like that my son reacts to it and kicks wherever I place the amplifier piece so that has been the only benefit. If I haven't felt the baby move in a while I will use this and sure enough he will kick it and I know he is alright. Unfortunetly that is not the only thing I wanted it for- I really wanted to hear the heartbeat. My midwife says not to use it very much because the babies don't like the feedback it produces. Don't order it expecting great results.
1,28 Weeks and still can't hear a thing,"We can't hear anything with this monitor - not even our own hearts with the receiver right over our chests! My mother-in-law, who's a nurse, said that at this point in my pregnancy a cheap stethoscope would work better. We're disappointed that we spent the money on something that we had been excited to try."
1,Wish I read reviews first,"I thought this would be a great purchase, but found that I am unable to hear the heartbeat. I hear all the other noises in the room but not the baby, wish I didn't waste my money."
1,What a waste,I received this as a shower gift and was really anxious to use it. At 8 months pregnant I couldnt hear a thing. I moved the microphone everywhere on my belly and nothing. It does however pick up every sound in the neighborhood. Don't even think of buying this piece of junk!
1,basically useless,"When I first saw the Bebe Sounds prenatal listener, I knew that I had to have it! The idea of being able to listen to my little one's heartbeat at home was thrilling. Every month, I had loved going to my prenatal appointments just so I could hear her. Unfortunately, I tried time and again with this device and was unsuccessful in ever really knowing what I was hearing. I tried from week 20 until 34 weeks when I just gave up. Although I followed all of the directions, this product only helped me hear one thing - my husband complaining about all the money I wasted!!! Please don't make the same mistake. If you want to hear a heartbeat, rent a doppler like your health care provider has. Check the classified ads in mom/baby fitness magazines. I wish I had."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I purchased this in my 5th month of pregnancy and I am now in my 8th month. The only thing that I have heard with it is my own heartbeat and the sounds of my own stomach growling . When I visit the doctor, my baby's heartbeat is very strong and loud but I have not been able to get ANYTHING with this. In my opinion, it is a waste of money and time."
1,"Zero Stars, if possible.","I also purchased the Bebe Prenatal listener from another store. I just returned it today. I tried it everynight as detailed in the users manual and only heard faint wooshing and my digestive noise. Never heard anything as described in the manual...kicks, hiccups or the heartbeat. My husband was always worried that I could not hear the heartbeat and I had to calm him saying ""the manual says it may take awhile to hear it or that we would not hear the heart beat everyday"".... Well that got old, my baby moves all the time and at some point, the heart should have been in a favorable position for me to hear it. The manual stresses to read the directions closely and don't get discouraged...2 months of trying at 6 + months was enough. It only took one month to get pregnant, and that should be the effort, not trying to hear on this device. I'm buying a stethoscope tomorrow from a medical supply store as I've already missed out on 2 months of hearing the heartbeat at home."
1,a waste...,"As many others have stated, this product is NOT worth a penny. It's a waste of plastic unless you're interested in hearing the quietest sounds around you rather than baby.I've heard people say that it might depend on the weight of mom, but I can tell you, that is not true at all. I'm a thin woman, and not once did I hear baby's heartbeat, and I tried EVERY DAY, until my last month when I finally gave up. Baby was moving so much that I didn't need to hear the heartbeat to know everything was ok.Save your money on something more useful. And if you're that concerned about hearing baby's heartbeat, try renting a doppler from a hospital or typing something like ""rent fetal heart doppler"" in a google search and rent one online."
1,Not worth the money,"We bought this product when I was 28 weeks pregnant. My husband is convinced he has heard the heartbeat, but I'm not sure. We definitely hear lots of other noises, but whether it's my digestive system or the baby, I don't know. I am now almost 34 weeks pregnant and we'll try again to hear it this week, but I am not very confident. We bought just the monitor, not the gift set. All I can say is, maybe it will work in the next few weeks, but I would never buy it again."
2,ehh..,I never heard a heart beat with this device. Money thrown down the drain & purchase regreted :(
1,don't waste your money!!,i don't normally write reviews but this thing is a piece of junk and i wanted to do whatever i could to keep others from wasting their money. all you hear is generic noise. i am now 36 weeks....one month from delivery and i never heard a heartbeat. i would always try right after getting back from the doctor's office and hearing a heartbeat. nothing.
3,"Never heard a single heartbeat, even with twins inside.","Tried right up to a week before delivery and never was able to hear either of our babies heartbeats (twins). We could hear them moving around from time to time, but that was about it.The speakers are fun though. Every time my wife would hook them up it would get the babies kicking all over the place. So it was worth it just for that to us, but I suppose if you held a pair of headphones on there it would work just as well."
3,"It's ok, but I would have gotten something else","I got this as a gift from my mother-in-law at 6 months. At that time we honestly could not hear anything, besides my stomach growl. Now at 35 weeks, my husband & I can actually hear her heartbeat. I can listen best about 30 minutes after eating a meal. You MUST however be in a room with COMPLETE silence to hear anything at all. My husband likes the microphone. As he sings to our baby, we can see her move around in my tummy towards the microphone. Overall, even though we are only really now actually getting to enjoy the product, I would say to save your $$ and get something else."
1,HUNK OF JUNK!!!!!,"WHAT A RIP-OFF!!! I would actually give this product LESS than one star if I could. I was so eager to buy this product, but my 9-month pregnant girlfriend insisted I shouldn't waste my money, and instead gave me hers a few days before she delivered. It never worked for her, and now, at 7 months along, it still hasn't worked for me. All I can hear is gurgling-type noises, which sound EXACTLY the same as when I hold the device up to my HUSBAND'S stomach! I have lots of pregnant girlfriends, and I have yet to find a single person who has used this product with any amount of success. If you really want to clearly hear and acurately measure your baby's heartbeat at home, consider renting a doppler device instead, (see babybeat.com or storkradio.com). These devices are of doctor's-office-quality, and you can rent them for around $30 a month. Otherwise, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THE BEBE SOUNDS!!!! THIS PRODUCT IS A JOKE!!!!"
1,Don't Bother,"At 30 weeks pregnant, I thought for sure that I would be able to hear the baby's heartbeat. I hear the movement of the monitor's cord, the creaking of the joint in my finger, and the slight movement of the monitor over my stomach as I inhale and exhale, but I don't hear the heartbeat. It is very frustrating to try to use this product. It says to be patient, and I am a very patient person, but I know when something isn't going to work -- and this won't work, no matter how many times I try. I would not recommend this thing to anyone. Don't waste your time or money!"
1,The Pregnancy Purchase that I Regretted the Most,"I read the reviews, which were mostly bad, then bought the product anyway. I figured that if I followed the instructions it would work. I tried desperately to make this product work. I used it all through my pregnancy (to the last month) and it never worked for me. I am still resentful about it. It's been my biggest waste of money so far (the diaper genie being the next biggest.) Hope this was helpful."
2,save your money and your hopes,"Luckily, I did not buy this product. My mother bought it for me hoping to hear the sounds of her first grandchild's heart. I am currently 35 weeks and have not heard the heart. I hear the rumblings of movement, I hear the creaking in the joint of my finger as I hold the button down, alas, no heartbeat. I have been very let down by this product, as has my mother. I followed the instructions to the letter (they stress in the instructions that you cannot use the product without following every word of their instructions).What a bummer product this is."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,I never write reviews but felt compelled to write this one. I was very excited to learn that I could hear my first baby's heartbeat without waiting to go to the doctor's office. I purchased this product and I am now in my 25th week and can hear EVERYHING but the baby's heartbeat. This product is such a waste of time. I wish that I could return it.
3,50/50,"I found my baby's heartbeat after a few tries...but it is definitely not as clear as I would have thought from reading the package. I recieved mine as a gift, I don't think I would have spent that much money on this item. I started using my monitor during the end of the 8th month.A very interesting aspect of this product is the reaction I got while using the small speakers and CD. My baby kicks like crazy every time I turn it on. I really think he enjoys the music. I haven't needed to use the belt to hold the speakers in place...I just place them in the elastic part of my maternity pants and they stay just fine.I would recommend one of the prenatal listeners that become a baby monitor for after the baby is born if you intend on buying one of these. At least that way you can get some use out of the thing if you can't get a heartbeat and don't like mozart."
1,Don't buy this product!,"I purchased this product when I was only a few months pregnant. I thought that I would be able to at least hear something around 20 weeks. Well, I am now 38 weeks (two weeks until my due date) and I still cannot hear much. Just this week I started hearing something, but who knows if it is really the heartbeat! If you really want to hear your babies heartbeat I recommend renting a doppler. You can get one online and use them from 12 weeks on! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
1,Don't even bother...,I bought this item and let me tell you it was a waste of money. I never got to hear the heartbeat only the cars driving on the street. You do get to hear your own stomach and bowels moving but that's not what you're getting it for. It's a piece of junk.
1,A piece of junk!,"I thought that I would get some peace of mind being able to hear my baby's heartbeat with this product. BOY WAS I WRONG! I totally wasted my money! I want to try and return it. All I heard was some loud, obnxious clanks! And I heard these sounds regardless of what I put it up to...stomach, chest, arm, leg, etc. And the product instructions say that you can hear when the baby moves and kicks Well, I watched my stomach jump from the baby's movements, while using the device and didn't hear a darn thing. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS THING! IT DOES NOTHING!"
1,Don't waste your time or money!,"I was so excited to get this as a gift, until I tried it. I may as well get two paper cups and connect them to a string instead!It is absolutely useless!!!! It doesn't matter how far along you are, my friend is about 81/2 months pregnant and can't hear a thing either!Diana"
1,Don't Buy!!!,"Do not buy the Bebe Sonds Prenatal Listerner. This product does not work, even on medium sound. The only thing this product did was make my wife worry that something was wrong with our son. Even at 8 months, it still doesn't work yet the baby is alive and kicking. This thing is a joke and a waste of money. So don't even think that it will work for you and that you should give it a try. This company should be sued."
3,"If you have patience, it works wonderfully!","My wife and I purchased this product and after a couple of minutes were able to hear the babies heartbeat. So much so in fact that we were able to use our computer to create a disc of the heartbeat. The only drawback was that any other sounds were amplified, but the pros outweight the cons. Great product!!"
1,what are these people thinking,"this item is only good for ease-dropping. it is better than a glass to the wall. doc says half of the peeps think they are hearing the baby, but are really hearing their heart...which can beat fast at times...especially after you bother with this thing long enough and get frustrated. after 4 weeks i bought a doppler on ebay for $130, you can get them now for $70ish. if you rent they are $20-50 per month."
1,Not So Helpful,We were anxious to hear the baby's heartbeat. This listener will not provide you with what you expect to hear. I could only use it for the last few weeks of the pregnancy. In order to hear anything you must be in a silent room and have ultrasonic hearing. You can hear a faint heartbeat in your 9th month if you practice often. It is not worth it. Invest and rent the dobbler if you need real reinforcent on a regular basis especially from early on.
1,Complete Waste of Money!,"This is a piece of junk! I absolutely do not recommend this product. My husband bought it for me and it is awful! We have tried and tried again to hear our son's heartbeat! I am 25 weeks pregnant, and the packaging says you will be able to hear the heartbeat at 20 weeks! All we can hear is static. It makes the same sound if you put it on your arm! This item is a peice of junk! Do not waste your money!"
1,waste of money,"I am six months pregnant and still cannot hear my baby's heartbeat. I do enjoy using the fetal speakers and mic to play music and read to my baby. He gets very excited when hearing my voice; however, I purchased this item mainly to hear his heartbeat. I wish I had read the reviews prior to purchasing ...you will NOT hear your child's heartbeat with this monitor."
2,"Quiet as a Mouse, Still as a Rock","I just bought the prenatal listen by itself and was dissapointed that I had to hold the monitor and the button down the whole time I was trying to listen. Any slight movement of your hand or finger while holding the device or pressing the button can sound like a kick. This thing takes alot of patience but if you can be still as a rock, quiet as a mouse you can hear the baby's movements, I haven't been able to hear baby's heartbeat yet, just my own and I'm 20 wks."
2,Needs to Improve,This system does not work as well as it states it will. It tries to give you a warning that if you are not that far along you will not be able to hear the baby heart beat and it also says the heart beat won't sound like it does in the doctor's office. My husband and I purchased this when I was 5 months and I'm now 8 months and we still can't honestly say we have heard the heart beat. We basically uses this now to talk to our baby. I wouldn't recommend spending the money on this.
2,"Nice idea, but...","We were looking forward to purchasing this item to hear our baby's heart beat. Unfortunately, we haven't had much luck with it... it's hard to find the heart beat, you can hear any external sounds and even hear your hand moving around on the device. We're going to keep trying though... maybe it will work sometime in the 7 weeks before our baby is due..."
1,Bad Product that doesn't deliver,This Prenatal heart listener is junk.All you hear is Stomach and Intestine noises. I Would buy a book or something instead.
1,Waste of time and money,"I bought this product at 4 months, I couldn't wait to use it. I am now 8 months pregnant and haven't heard any sign of a heart beat, I hear my food digesting though to remind me of how fat I am now. Don't waste your time or the money. By yourself a weight watchers package deal for after the baby comes..."
1,Very Disappointed,I haven't been able to hear the heartbeat once and I am 26 weeks along. At first it scared me to use the monitor and not hear anything but the cars passing outside. Waste of money!
2,Can't hear the heartbeat!,"We bought this product as soon as we found out that we were pregnant and I couldn't wait for the fifth month to hear the heartbeat. I'm now over 8 months pregnant and still can't find it. I do enjoy listening to him moving around but I'm really not sure if it's him or just my own stomach rumbling!I enjoy using the product to play Mozart music and to speak to him, but I wouldn't have paid the money just to do these things."
3,Bebe Sounds Prenatal Listener,"Well I purchased this for my daughter, she was very excited about it. The first one we received was defective, the CD of music kept skipping so we requested a replacement. Haven't been able to find the time to hear the baby's heartbeat lately, when it was first received she couldn't hear it. Basically all that is used from this is the CD and the microphone, she just hooks it up to her CD player and plays the baby music. Not sure if I would ever pay full price for this or not. Glad it was on sale."
1,NEVER WORKED,Ive had 2 pregnancys and My sister in law and I were pregnant at the same time. We both would try using this monitor and never heard anything but ourselves. Mine doubled as a toy for my 2 year old. Dont waste your money.
1,WAY too sensitive... don't bother,"That horrendous sound you're hearing is actually the tiny bit of friction in the nuckles of your fingers because this device is SO sensitive, it will pick up EVERYthing. We found it to be so rediculously sensitive that it was impossible to differentiate the baby's heartbeat from other sounds such as the mother's digestive system. The worst part was trying to keep still enough to eliminate these parasitic noises. Even the most impercievable joint movement in the user's hand is picked up loud enough to block out all other sounds. Spend your money on something else."
1,Not worth a cent!,This product is not worth your hard earned money. Spend a few extra dollars and rent or purchase a doppler.
1,useless,"I do not own the bebe sounds deluxe kit, but I own the regular one-headset version and IT DOES NOT WORK. Do yourself a favor and buy something you really need with the money you would be wasting on this."
1,Listen to 99% of the reviews -- Not worth it!,"I bought this set for my husband for Christmas b/c I thought it would be cool for him to hear the baby whenever he wanted to. I spent the extra $$$ on the deluxe set b/c of the fact I could play music to the baby. Well, I was 6 months pregnant and we couldn't find a heartbeat anywhere. Even if the room is totally silent we still couldn't find it and I read the instructions! I bought it online for $40 and am selling it now on Ebay for 1/2 that. I'm in my 8th month and still don't hear anything. I guess I just was hoping I'd get it to work. Don't bother."
1,Waste of money and source of anxiety,"DO NOT BUY. This product stinks - it doesn't work/detect until well into the pregnancy (when you are less concerned than earlier); instead, rent the better/more sensitive version. Of course, not hearing a hearbeat totally stressed you out, so save yourself the anxiety. The better (rentals) detect earlier, will give you more peace of mind when you most need it. They said they would give me a refund, but never sent it and said they didn't receive the monitor which I had shipped back to them."
2,Disappointed,"Someone gave me this monitor in the beginning of my pregnancy. I am now eight months pregnant and I have yet to find my baby's heartbeat on this monitor. I have followed the directions and it still does not work. Even in the quietest room, all I can hear is a humming and an occasional thump from my baby. Definitley a waste of money."
1,Not worth the money,When my husband and I got this product we couldn't wait to hear the baby's heartbeat. I was 5 months pregnant then and am 7 months now and have yet to hear it with this product. I like playing music for the baby but you can do that with just a CD player and headphones...
1,What a waste!,"My husband and I tried patiently to hear SOMETHING with this thing. We finally gave up when, at 27 weeks, we both SAW the baby kick the very spot where we had the listener placed. The manual says that kicks sound like a ""thud."" We heard nothing but the same old ""whooshing."" I was shocked since this thing picks up every sound outside and around the belly loud and clear. Anyone who hears heart beat or hiccups with this listener must have a much softer internal ""whooshing"" going on!"
2,Had to be on a weird angle to hear,"I tried from 4.5 months through my 6 month of pregnancy to hear my child's heartbeat. Finally after numerous attempts, arching my back while sitting and placing it right above my navel I hear my child's heartbeat."
1,Worst purchase of the pregnancy!,"I am now 9 months pregnant and with the exception of one time (where I THOUGHT I heard my son's heartbeat), the most I heard was the cute sounds of my intestines...and this is after spending at least 1/2 hour searching. At one point (well into my 5th month), I got excited after hearing thumps (which are supposed to be kicks), but the excitement was short lived when I put the listener on my husband's stomach and found that his stomach made the same sounds. Save yourself the money."
1,PIECE OF JUNK...,Dont waste your money. I bought this when I was 20 weeks pregnant and I am still trying to hear the heartbeat at 32 weeks. The only thing I can hear is my intestines growling and my dog in the other room breathing. This product is a real let-down and I do not advise anyone to buy this piece of junk...
1,Cannot Hear baby's heart rate!,"We got this product hoping to hear the baby's heartbeat when my wife was about 4 months pregnant, but could not hear actual heartbeat. Waited until 5, 6, 7, even 8 months, tried many many times, but could not hear it! It did not work for us, I'm not sure how many people actually have success with this product. This is not like what you see in Doctor's office, those devices use different technology (doppler). Be careful since stores such as motherhood don't let you return it, so if it does not work for you, you're stuck with it!"
1,Major Disappointment,"We purchased this product early in our pregnancy. At first it was exciting to here the baby moving even though I really could not feel it. After many attempts, even up to my due date, to hear the baby's heartbeat we are very disappointed with the quality of this product. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Save your money!"
1,Great idea...if it worked!,"I tried to listen to my baby's heartbeat throughout my pregnancy and was unable to hear it, even at 8 months! It picks up all the ambient noise and can barely pick up your heartbeat and stomach sounds. Great idea, if it worked."
1,Piece of Garbage,I am pregnant with my first child and purchased this six months into my pregnancy. I have not been able to get this thing to work even now that I'm at nine months. I've even brought this along with me to my doctor's visit and she thought that this monitor was a piece of junk. Don't waste your time or your money with this product!!
2,DON'T DO IT,"THE MONITOR IS HARDLY WHAT WE EXPECTED IT TO BE. I WAS 6MONTHS WHEN WE BOUGHT IT & WE WERE SO EXCITED THAT WE OPENED THE PACKAGE IN THE CAR! OF COURSE THE ONLY THING WE HEARD WAS ROAD NOISE, BUT WHEN WE GOT HOME WE STILL DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING (EXCEPT STOMACH GROWLINGS & OUR OWN HEARTBEAT). THE BABY DID MOVE AROUND ALOT MORE WHEN WE LISTENED FOR HER. THE ONLY THING THAT I LIKE ABOUT THE SOUNDS MONITOR IS THAT WHEN WE USE THE DEVICE TO SPEAK TO THE BABY, SHE MOVES AROUND ALOT RIGHT NEAR THE SPEAKERS. WE READ TO HER EVERY NIGHT WITH IT & SHE SEEMS TO ENJOY IT."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"I tried this several times throughout my pregnancy. Each time I really could not hear anything. Mostly what I hard was the moving of the device over my belly. I had to sit really still in order not to hear the device moving. I even tried it when my baby had the hiccups, I couldn't even hear that. I also had to be in a very quiet room with no one talking and the tv off. Once I heard a swooshing sound, but other than that- nothing. Don't waste your money on this one. You are better paying for a device that the midwives use."
1,Don't waste your money!!!,"This item was the biggest waste of moeny!! I bought it at 24 weeks gestation and am now 34 weeks along and have been ATTEMPTING to use it faithfully...but all I hear is my stomach gurgling (big whoop) and my hearbeat. And, the headset is now starting to go out on it. Since it is a 'personal product' they don't offer a money back guarantee. Pay the extra money to rent a medical doppler and you'll be happier."
3,Patience very necessary...,"I bought this at about 24 weeks gestation. I find it works best when I am on a full tummy (about an hour or 2 after I have eaten) and laying back. I can't find the heartbeat unless I have literally COMPLETE silence. It's taken me anywhere from 5 to 45 minutes to find a heartbeat. As the other reviews say, you do get lots of interference from the cords on the headphones or even the slightest movement.Also, keep in mind that your baby can hear sounds outside of the womb after about 20-24 weeks, so if you decide to get this, don't make a huge OVERinvestment and get the deluxe set. Just get the one that has the one or two headset(s) which are much cheaper. =)"
1,Do not buy this product. Listen to people review.,I always wanted to get this product even though I read all review and this product has a poor review but I believed those couple people who gave good reviews. Do not buy this product. I bought this product when I was 4.5 months pregnant. My husband and I tried this product and follow the instruction almost everyday for 2 weeks. You cannot hear the fetal's heartbeat but everything else. You can't hear your own hearteat when you put it against your chest. I was going to keep it for the Microphone but by 6 months my baby can hear everything outside the womb. I can just play the music from the CD player and the baby can hear it. So we returned the product. Please don't buy this product just keep your money for those Baby Mozart and other classical music CDs.
1,Return to Unisar for REFUND!!!!,"Like so many others, I wasn't able to hear my baby's heartbeat with this device and was incredibly unhappy with my purchase. As it was used, I couldn't return it to Babies-R-Us and so contacted Unisar Inc. who provided a full refund. I'm not usually one to leave reviews or contact companies about my disappointment but I was shocked by the numerous negative reviews left on this site and the false advertising of this device. They were relatively prompt with their response and only requested that the device be returned with the receipt."
1,Doesn't work very well at all!,"I bought this at 5 months and NEVER heard a heartbeat, even up to my last week of pregnancy! All you can hear is slushy noises and the pulse of your uterus. If you want to play music for your baby then just buy a CD and use your own headphones. Don't bother spending money on this."
1,MAUREEN JENKINS 7MOS IN S.C.(THE BRUMBLE OF HUNGER),"I HAD TO RATE ONE STAR BECAUSE THEY SAID SO,BUT IAM LYING TO YOU.MY BEBE SET WAS A HAND ME DOWN PARTLY BRAND NEW AT THE TIME STILL I COULDN'T HEAR ANYTHING BUT MY HEARTBEAT OR GAS ROLLINGAROUND. SO GOOD THING I DIDN'T WASTE MY MONEY LIKE THE OTHERS CAUSE YOU COULD HAVE PURCHASED A SET OF BOTTLES INSTEAD. IAM VERY UPSET BECAUSE I WAS SO EXCITED AND EAGER TO HEAR MY BABY'S HEARTBEAT AND GOT NOTHING AT FIRST IT SCARED ME THAT I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING CAUSE I THOUGHT THE WORST AND PANIC! I WORRIED SO BADLY I CALLED THE OBGYN AND SCHELDULED AN APPT. I WAS AT EASE WHEN I HEARD HIS HEARTBEAT AND WHEN I GOT HOME I THREW IT AWAY, JUST A BUNCH OF TRASH THAT NEEDS TO BE PULLED OF THE MARKET UNTIL THEY CAN COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT'S BETTER AND MOST OF ALL ACCURATE HEARING.A MOMMY THAT'S STILL KANGAROOING!!"
1,not good,"i bought this listener when i was about 22 weeks i am not 25 weeks and still have not heard a thing. all i heard was cars going by,the click of the button in my ear when i press it (ouch!!!) and my dog snoring, the fridge running and any other background noise. i wish i never spent the money on it. if i could afford it i would by one of the dopler listeners like my doctor has. dont buy this product."
3,Takes alot of Patience,"At first I was un happy with this product, but after refusing to let my money to go to waste I figured it out. You have to lay on it & keep re-positioning it till you find the heartbeat.Takes awhile, but with enough practice & patience you find it."
1,Piece of Garbage,"Don't bother with buying this. I've had this since 21 weeks and i am now almost 35. Every so often you can hear the baby kick, but no heartbeat. It's good if you want to hear your stomach rumble up close and personal."
1,Don't waste your time...,"I'd have to agree with other negative reviews I've read. This product is poorly developed. The entire handheld device is extremely sensitive to every movement, noise, creak, etc., that you or anyone near you could make. I even heard my husband snoring thru closed doors in the headset when I was trying to get it to work one night. Besides all my other internal noises, I can say I could hear the kicks when my baby moved, but that's not enough to persuade me to keep the monitor. It's going back to the store tomorrow. If you want to spy on someone's conversation down the street, this product is for you... Otherwise, you probably won't have much luck hearing your baby's heartbeat over all the other noise. I wonder if the folks who rated this product with 4-5 stars actually knew what they were hearing..."
3,It's okay....it really does work!,"I am 31 weeks pregnant and bought this about 1 month ago. I had a hard time at first, and like others heard my own knuckles cracking no matter how still I tried to be. I could hear the baby kick ofcourse. The last couple weeks I finally found the baby's heart beat. Yes, you really can hear it. You just have to be in the right position and be patient. I sit up in a recliner instead of laying flat, I found that to be the best position to hear. I also pretty much know the way my baby is lying inside...which makes a big difference. Their position matters too. Baby really does respond to the BEBE monitor on my tummy, it is a really neat way to interact."
2,not worth it!,"I bought this product with high hopes to hear the baby, and it doesnt work. the reasson i gave it 2 starts was because, my family and i reversed it (by talking in the microphone and putting the head phones on my belly) and talked to the baby, which it started to kick! but that was the only good thing it did (was let the baby hear the rest of the faimly)!"
1,Total Waste of Money!,Please I urge you not to buy this product. We have tried every way to use this and I can barely even hear my own heartbeat with this product. Just save your money and enjoy listening to the heartbeat at the OBGYN. I just saved you 20 bucks!
2,Use a stethoscope instead!!!,"In spite of what the reviews say and the warnings of other mothers, I bought this machine and have heard nothing but static. You have to hold the button steady to listen and all you hear is your finger trying to hold the button. The only good thing about this product is I can play music and talk to the baby. My daughter actually responded to the music and my singing. I can hear the baby better with a plain stethoscope. That's how I heard her heartbeat. BTW, I paid less than $10 for my stethoscope!!!"
1,Total waste of money,"My husband and I bought this when I was pregnant with out first child we didn't buy it until I was 30 weeks pregnant we tried using it over and over again until I had the baby and it never worked!We tried using it again with our second child and it still didn't work, everyone i know has had the same results, you can hear your body but not the baby's heartbeat.Save your money and rent a neonatal unit those are great!"
2,Not worth 40 dollars,"I bought this for myself when I was 4 months pregnant. I knew I wouldn't be able to hear any sounds right away, but I figured it would be worth the buy a few months down the road. I am now 8 1/2 months pregnant and have yet to hear the baby's heartbeat. (I've been listening for it from 18 wks on). I read the directions from cover to cover and even used it when his back was against my stomach (the best place they said to listen), but heard nothing. As for his kicks and hiccups, they are fairly easy to listen to as long as you lay still. The only part worth buying in the package is the microphone to play music to and read to him because he responds, but I'm sure regular headphones over your tummy work just as good. Overall, I was not too impressed and would not recommend this product for the price."
1,Very cheap stethoscope with volume control,"We bought the fetal heart monitor at a local retailer and were unimpressed upon opening the package. The documentation tells you over and over again that you cannot return the item to the retailer if you aren't happy with it; that you must call the manufacturer for a return. 1. This isn't true. We returned it with no problems. 2. This tells me that the manufacturer has problems with people not liking the quality of the product and returning it.This listener is essentially a VERY cheap stethoscope with volume control. It picks up any little noise, so you have to wait for a while after eating or drinking anything to use it, you have to lay down in a very quiet room, and I at least had to have my wife hold her breath because any movement of her body was picked up."
1,COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY!!!!,I bought this product it was the worst investment I have ever made! I could not hear my babies heart beat what so ever with this even up to my 35th week of pregnancy. It was pretty frustrating and scary at times not being able to hear a thing especially being a first time mommy. I would not waste a cent on this product!
1,We Even Knew Where Baby's Heart Was,We had the priveledge of having 4 ultrasounds done and everytime we went home to hear the baby's heartbeat....nothing but static (this was even during the 35th week).
1,Not even worthy of 1 star!,"Complete waste of money! I couldn't get it to pick up the heartbeat, even at the end of my pregnancy! I ended up calling the company and sending it back to them for a refund (they do guarantee your satisfaction). Don't bother with it!"
4,Works well with only a few flaws.,We just got the prenatal listener 5 days ago and I am very pleased with the product. The first night we couldn't hear the baby's heartbeat but after reading the book that comes with the kit it tells you that sometime you won't be able to hear it depending on the placement of the baby. The book also told you what to listen to and what each sound was. Ever night after that we haven't had a problem hearing the heartbeat. I am 7 months pregnant and I think it is great. The only downfalls that I can find are the fact that you have to continually push in the button and that you really need to have everything completely quiet in the room for this to work or else it picks up all kinds of feedback. But besides that I think it is well worth the money. I am glad that we got it.
1,Please don't buy this!!,"I bought this when I was 5 months pregnant and tried several times to find the heartbeat and was unable to. I even tried it on my friend who was 8 months and it didn't work. Maybe some people have had luck with this product but I certainly didn't. If you are really looking for something to give you peace of mind, I would recommend renting a doppler. They don't cost too much and it's a piece of medical equipment that will work everytime. That is what I did and I was able to get the reassurance I needed."
2,Average Purchase,"I bounght the monitor naturally to hear the HB. At 24 weeks I still just hear the sounds of her kicking inside me. Now those are precious, and for the counting that we need to do later in the pregnancy, that may come in handy. However, if you are buying this to hear the HB...I fear the other reviewers are correct...it is a waste of your money!"
3,It kinda works!,"When I saw the Bebe Sounds Prenatal Listener on the shelf, and I thought,""Oh how neat!"". Being the excited first time mother I am, I bought it right away.What I didn't realize was that it didn't really work until the middle of your second trimester. But none the less it still worked. You do have to be in a silent room, if there is any little noise coming from, say you're t.v., the Bebe monitor will pick that up instead of your baby. And you do have to play with it a bit to find out where the perfect spot is to hear your child's heartbeat. Plus if you have the volume set to high you will only hear your heart. But after a bit of trial and error you will eventually hear your baby!If you purchase this monitor in your first trimester or early in your second, it will not work. But if you wait until the end of your second trimester you will have a ball listening to your baby, I know I did!"
1,Not worth the money,"I am in my seventh month and still cannot pick up a heart beat with this thing! I got curious and put the thing right over my own heart and could not even pick up my own heart beat! Unfortunately, I bought mine in a maternity store and cannot even return it to get my money back! If you want to play music for your baby grab your walkman, turn it up and put the head phones on your belly. It works just as well and costs a whole lot less!"
1,Don't buy this!,"I bought this product when pregnant with my first child, and tried it again when pregnant with my second child. I never heard a heartbeat! I suggest that no one waste money on this product, it only served to worry me. I am a small person, so it is not as though it had a lot of fat to go through, I tried it even toward the end of my pregnancies and never heard a heartbeat. Please don't waste your money."
1,Don't Buy! Just a Gimic for Parents,I'd give this a 0 stars but that is not an option. I am 28 days away from my due date and I have yet to hear the heartbeat via this device. My husband and I bought it and tried it. It didn't work. We'd turn it low and then high and still no heartbeat! The worst part is that it is considered a health and beauty product and can't be returned to the store. Don't take the risk... you'll regret it!
1,Not great...,SO far I am 24 weeks and I haven't heard a peep with this monitor and honestly I can barely hear my own heart beat when I hold it up to my left chest area. The only sounds I can hear are some minor whooshing sounds which could be anything.
1,A piece of junk!,I bought this because I wanted to be able to hear my baby in between pre natal visits. Well even after following the directions EXACTLY I could never hear anything but my own stomach. Also the classical CD that comes with this set is junk! It skips and sometimes won't play at all. It's not worth the money or the time you have to put into this.
1,Save your money for something that works!,The heart monitor doesn't work at all. All you get is outside noise.
1,Piss Poor Product!,"Even after reading the bad reviews, I decided to give this product the benefit of the doubt. I was completely disappointed!!! Especially since I was so excited at the thought of being to hear my babies heart beat on a regular basis as oppose to having to wait until the monthly doctor's visits. I agree, save yourself the cash!!"
5,What a wonderful at home experience!!!!!,"I absolutely loved this product when I was pregnant. My baby was very cooperative and would go right over to the receiver and hit/kick it even at a very early stage (around 18 weeks). Later on in the pregnancy, we did find a heartbeat and it was very distinct. So distinct, in fact, that I could even count how many times it would beat in a minute. I also used this product to stimulate the baby if I questioned whether he was moving around enough (he would always push back when he got pushed on). Another thing that I loved about this product is that anyone could listen to the baby with me. Everyone in my family really enjoyed having that experience (which would not have been possible otherwise since not everyone could go to the doctor's office with me). I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to be able to share all of these wonderful things with whoever wants to join in on the fun!!!"
1,Save your money,I was so excited about this product and everything it promised that I bought it as soon as I could. Of course no where on the outside of the box does it tell you that you should be at least 5 months pregnant to hear the heartbeat (they do mention it in the instruction booklet once you've opened everything). So I had to wait about 4 weeks. I am now 8 months pregnant and have yet to hear the heartbeat no matter where I position the monitor or how still I lie. I can only pick up stomach noises and my own heartbeat. It's very disappointing. As for the music aspect- the baby doesn't require the microphone to hear so I'm returning this product and using my regular stereo to play music to him- [money] is too much for something I can do for free and the money can better be spent on something that works.
1,What a bummer,"At first I thought it was neat what I was hearing. The gurgling sounds and kicks, until I put it on my husband and heard the same thing. I'm almost positive he does not have a baby in his belly. Very dissapointed."
1,Way too expensive,I bought this product and it is sitting on my dining room table. First of all when you read the booklet it tells you that you should be 5 months pregnant or more. I am 4 months pregnant and I cannot hear a thing and I don't think that I will ever hear anything. My advice is wait for your prenatal appointments. This product is way too expensive and it is a waste of good money.
2,Don't Get Too Excited,I had purchased this monitor for my husband who insisted on having one. I was so excited to give it to him but the excitement didnt last long. Maybe if you are experienced and know what your listening to it could be enjoyable. But all you hear are your own stomach noises. I was tempted to bring it to one of my doctors appointments so he could shed some light onto what I was listening to but I was too embarrassed.
3,Good resource,"Software Safety and Reliability is an excellent resource for those who want to learn more about software safety. By going into detail into the approaches taken by a number of respected organizations, the reader can take the best of each and apply them to their own problems.The major weakness in the approach was the reliance on software reliability as the major tool. A system safety approach as advocated by Dr. Nancy Leveson is much more complete and effective than reliability. Her latest book, Safeware: System Safety and Computers is a better resource for those who are really interested in the ""How to's"" of an effective software safety program.For the Software Safety professional, both references would be essential for your bookshelf."
3,Software safety standards intro,"Q. What's there to know about most software-intensive system safety standards?A. They proscribe what is considered to be an appropriate level of software engineering rigor proportional to the risk associated with the development.The objectives each standard requires are somewhat different - eg 50128 front loads on formal analysis, DO-178B emphasizes verification of expected behavior etc...If you really need to know the difference between standards then chances are you need the standards in question. This book won't provide you a better insight than that. If you are in the business of system safety you will quickly outgrow the works of Hermann and Leveson."
1,Worst MOVIE I've ever seen,"This is definately the worst movie ever. I can't believe I watched the whole thing. It keeps getting worse and worse as it goes on. The plot goes from OK at the beginning, to down right horrible at the end. The soundtrack has got to be one of the worst ever also. Don't waste your time on this movie."
2,"Waste of time, film, and Drago","This thing was just dreck. Mindless. The only thing worse than the plot and most of the acting was Billy Drago's haircut. Billy, I love you, but, put down the Flowbee.The only good parts were the scenes between Drago and Richard Lynch--two old pros who know their way around thin plots and amateurish film making. If you're a fan of either man...well, I'm sorry, there's not much to recommend here. They do what they can with what they have. Otherwise, stay far away."
3,Scrotum? Nearly Licked 'um.,This book was very misleading! I thought it would be more graphic. A very nice and sensual idea though!
5,Great Book - Keep it UP!,"I give this Book FIVE golden stars! It is so good that I could not put it down from start to finish. Bravo Dr.Campbell. Keep up the good work of opening up the blinded eyes! Prejudice towards the real Gospel is like an onion, theres many layers and layers of pre-conceived deception and falsehoods over much of the muslim's eyes,that call for peeling off!"
1,"If you believe Dr Campell, then read this","Anyone who believes this book should buy the video debate between Dr Campell & DR Niak, which shows all the errors in the book. You can find it at islamicbookstore.com. search for Dr Campell & youll find the video of the debate they held in Chicago. See for yourself how poorly his book stands up to true facts & agreed upon translations. Its sad that people are motivated by hate to write such books."
2,hose too short,"I guess I assumed that portable AC units would be portable beyond 6 feet from the window. Clearly these products are designed for situations where a window unit cannot be employed because of the window and the weight it can support.The exhaust hose is literally 8 ft long and does not allow you to place the unit between two rooms or move it around the house as needed (because you would need to connect it to a different window) - which is what I thought they were.Buyer beware...if you intended to use it as it is designed, works fine. The unit is a little large, but it does pump out a lot of cool air."
5,Cool Cooler,This unit is easy to use and easy to move around. It provides plenty of cold air. I would recommend this product to anyone that needs a portable air conditioner.
4,Love This Product,"I love this product. This is my second SPT Portable Air Conditioner, I also own a 12,000-BTU. This size is perfect for my 2nd floor bedroom and upstairs hallway. I prefer the 12,000 BTU for the larger rooms in my house. Since we have had the air conditioner we have only had to drain the water once. I live in a very humid area, so I am very pleased that I haven't had to drain the water more. I live in a condo with only sliding glass doors with access to the outside. When venting through a slider I recomend purchasing a small piece of plexiglass to reach to the top of the opening. I would recomend this brand to anyone looking to purchase a portable air conditioner."
5,Portable air,"It test out OK but we haven't used it yet. We bought it for emergencies (loss power during hurricanes, etc.)"
2,IMpossible to maintain,"this air conditioner has one filter which is easily removed for cleaning purposes, but the intake filter is completely hidden and cleaning it entails disassembling the unit, removing the case, just to access the filters. What a nightmare."
2,Not very good,This thing just isn't worth the time or money so I suggest you pass on it. Well made unit and I've owned mine for several years. Used it for a while to cool part of my 250 ft houseboat. It would really only cool the very back of it. It's big and clunky and not real quiet. One problem is the compressor is inside of course and you hear it. The REAL problem is that it doesn't really cool. It seems to blow cold air but NEVER cools down the room.Anyone want mine?
1,DO NOT BUY!!,"WOW,THIS THING IS CRAP! IT RUNS AND RUNS BUT NOTHING HAPPENS. 5 DEGREES MAX COOLING. VERY LOUD,VERY LOUD,VERY LOUD. IF YOU WOULD LIKE A UNIT THAT YOU NEED TO RUN 24-7 TO COOL A 250 SQ. FOOT ROOM TO 73 DEGREES, THEN THIS IS THE UNIT FOR YOU. SAVE YOURSELF NOW. I NOW HAVE A $300 PAPER WEIGHT. DO NOT BUY!!!!!."
2,A Disorganized and Confusing Textbook.,"Explanations of concepts are constantly interrupted mid-paragraph by various secondary explanations, questions and diagrams that do not tie in well with the central concept that was being explained. I find it very difficult to follow when each page is scattered with little side projects for the student to try with the cd-rom or with a calculator. Just glancing at any page it is hard to find the heart of the material. I much prefer a text that focuses on straight forward explanations of concepts rather than what seems to me as mere gimmicks."
3,It is ok but not as described,The book is very good but there is not CD as described in the advertisement.
5,Strike Two Hits a Home Run,"For the baseball fan who can never be behind the scenes, on the field or in the dugout, Ron Luciano has filled the void. He shares with the reader his experiences, his interactions with the players, managers and the great game of baseball, making the reader feel like one of the insiders. This book will make you laugh out loud."
4,Great condition,"Better condition than I had expected, great product inside and out. This book is much needed for my classes and I look forward to using it."
4,Great CD for what it sets out to do...,"This is NOT the CD you'll want to buy if you...A. Are expecting any new music (It has none.)B. Are looking for a comprehensive collection of early hits from Amy (Look for a boxed set within the next year to accomplish that goal.)C. Are looking for an album that has a logical flow or sequence (This collection was put together by RCA, who only owns the rights to some of Amy's songs. They are not all that concerned with such things.)With that said, however, this CD does indeed find its way into my CD player quite frequently.For new fans, its a neat way to see what capabilities (or at least a few of them) Amy has musically.For those of us who have been fans for awhile, it's a nice collection of songs that we love. And, yes, they've been remastered so they truly sound better than ever....Thanks for reading,Chad"
5,Inspirational,A great mix of her songs. Very inspirational and many songs really rock! I recommend this to anyone how likes Christan music.
1,inspirational songs,"I've been an amy grant fan for 20 years, however certainly wouldn't recommend buying this cd. It's just poor songs from her early career, her long existing ""The Collection"" is great, this doesn't even compare. I feel abused as a fan that I was suckered into buying it."
2,Tired re-release,"No life, no spark, nothing new- not even arrangements. Not needed unless you don't have the albums these came from."
4,Great Introduction for non-speacialists...,"In this book readers will discover basic information about the most pertinent questions about the brain any educated person might ask. They include, 1) how does the brain function? 2) What makes it 'go'? 3) How has the history of neurology unfolded? What were the most important break throughs and what incorrect theories held the field back? 4) What neurology and computers and the use of the brain in conjunction with man made machines? Finally, matters of functional problems of teh brain are addressed and the latest in research and breakthroughs are noted. A generous reading list for each chapter is provided at the end of the book making this little book exactly what the title says: a very short, but nonetheless comprehensive introduction."
1,Not written for the reader but for the writer...,"Beware the nouns and pronouns, your brain? Are they talking about their brains or mine? Should be my brain. This concept creates a dissociative state in the mind, as if I have no brain."
5,Get It!,"Great to have a nice fold up stool to ease you worries on reaching things that are hard to reach or placed too high. It's sturdy, durable, light, a very good step stool!"
3,"Product is Good, Customer Service is Not","I ordered 2 Kingmax units but recieved 3 due to poor usability of the website. Thememstore shipped the 3 items together but billed me for 3 shipping charges (each equivalent to the cost of the item!). I complained to the company, and they offered to reimburse my shipping. But when I accepted they changed their reply to read they ""would see what they could do"". I never heard back from them in 6 months. I recently wrote back to inquire about it, but they blew me off. The Product is great but I recommend that you not order it from TheMemStore."
1,Fragile!,"If you buy this, don't put it on a keychain, or carry it in your pocket. I bought mine two weeks ago and yesterday it snapped in half (without any abuse on my part.) Nice and cheap, but you get what you pay for."
3,What does it really cost?,"Are you kidding me, 6.19$ shipping and handling EACH! There goes the savings! I figured I would order a few extra, make the shipping and handling a little less overall. I paid 20$ for the items and 30$ for the S&H."
1,Not Durable!!,"One problem is that it doesn't have the metal guides found on most USB drives that ensure the stick will be inserted properly. Without these guides you can insert it upside-down without knowing it. Eventually you figure it out when nothing happens, but you have to wait each time you use it. An LED light to indicate that it's getting power is something the manufacturers should have included in the design.This stick only lasted about 3 months, until it broke in my pocket. Luckily it didn't break the circuit board (so I could get my documents off of it), but it put an end to using the stick. Without the end piece that connected to the keychain, it would most certainly get lost being so small. I would not recommend it."
5,Awesome!,"C'mon, its just too cute to turn down!! And it comes with a little case and cord so if youre one of those people that lose tiny things like this easily, you can attach is to you phone, keychain, zipper. Its awesome and much less costly than the larger ones by other brands."
4,"Nice product, few cons","I bought this to carry a few portable apps around with. I keep it in the coin pouch portion of my wallet. It is about the thickness of a quarter and the length/width of a stick of Trident gum. The capacity is okay, but I'd prefer more options. As for the speed, I don't notice slowness but I don't transfer large files to or from it very often. For the low price, you get a nice product. The shipper also threw in a couple of pieces of candy."
5,so awesome,"I kept handing out my one drive to give/receive some files, wouldn't see it back for a week or longer. These are so crazy cheap that I was able to buy a handful."
3,4 for the price of 1,"There are places you can get the set for $24. If BarGrooves and jazz mix is your bag, City Lounge will fill the void. However, if you are looking for dance tunes, rhythm, beats that will get people up on the floor, this isn't it. I suppose the music would work best as background music (think KMart in a Bar Environment) while people are flirting with each other, concentrating on each others fleshy parts and sizes, and tanking Bombay and tequila.Using it to pass time while stuck in traffic, or as a musical upper while on the way to work, isn't quite the goal of this sound. Be happy you bought the set of 4 rather than each one individually, as some tracks are better than others, and some CDs better than others, and maybe may make the $24 seem a justified purchase (vs. $74 or so).Could be sexy enough music, but only if you are lying next to the other already naked and too lazy to get up and change the cd to something else..."
4,a long over due best of...,"i have been a fan of BiT for years and its great to finally have a collection of tunes on a single disc, but what made this collection a must for me was the dvd addition since video-wise i have only the main videos and the performance from 1991 the year punk broke. its great to see these girls again, i havent had a chance to view the whole thing but i am very happy to have it, i really wish i could still find a copy of ""not bad for a girl"" a documentry featuring BiT, L7 and the lunachicks etc, but then i would truely be spoiled. Kat you are my god, and babes you are missed, and to all the fans i say HELLO! and buy this!!! chad(z)"
3,complete text but no extras,"Kindle version: there is a table of contents but it doesn't show up in the menu, you have to page through to find it. All the writings are there but noextras-- no background info on the writer or the individual stories."
4,It's Complete!,"If you want a ""complete"" insight to the twisted, narcissistic personality of Oscar Wilde, this is the book for you"
3,good but....,"This is a pretty good wedge, but the grooves are fairly shallow. I can still play with it after using it for months, but this is not the best wedge you'll ever buy. It is well priced though."
4,Affinity 64 degree wedge,This club works very well. especially when getting the ball out of the high rough. I would recomend it to anyone considering it.
4,George Clinton like,"This cd exudes funk. The album cover exudes funk, Cee-Lo exudes funk, and most importantly, the album exudes funk. The problem lies in the fact that some of the songs are not funky, and that all those these songs are rare, they do limit the album funkyness. Another problem I have with this cd, is that while i listen to it, I cannot help but wonder why I am not listening to an old George Clinton cd, and I keep thinking that Cee-Lo, despite his talent, is not quite George Clinton. Nevertheless, this is a very good cd, and if you want to listen to good modern funk, you should listen to this."
4,VERY GOOD,I LIKED HIS SINGING ON THE VOICE THIS YEAR FOR THE CHRISTMASSHOW. DO YOU HAVE ANYMORE OF HIS CDS
3,A Fun Set,"the cool thing about this Album is that it has a Fun Funky Vibe about it.the charm&Vibe work really well for a while.""Closet Freak"" is one of the Freshest Jams I've Heard thus Far this Year.the only knock overall on Cee-Lo is that a Lengthy set like this wears a bit thin after a while but when the Grooves&Care-Free is in Effect then Cee-Lo is Very Much on point.I give Cee-Lo Props for shaking up the Game a Bit unlike Other Rap Releases&Material out now His actually has some Life to it."
5,Refreshing like a cold glass of water on a hot sumers day !!,"I am a big D.F.(dungon family) fan forever & with all this same ol' stuff it's getting all too predictuble with music.....in steps CEE-LO....result the most organic music(a mixture of all styles for all listeners)i've ever herd in a while.After hering closet freak i was hooked,like when a certan fuggie queen came dolo & blew the doors down. yes my friends if you NEED SOMETHING THAT'S UNPERDICTUBLE THIS IS IT FOR A WHILE YOU'LL LOOK NO FERTHER."
5,Cee-Lo Green Classic,I brought this CD because of the 5 star rating and I'm glad I did. This disc is great from beginning to end. This will be a Cee-lo Green Classic.
5,Curageously Creative,"If you are looking for something different, on the fringes of hip-hop, then look no further.Cee-lo sound is/was a very fresh welcome to my collection. This is actually the 2nd time I purchased this album. My first copy of it was stolen. This album has gotten regular play in my cd player since it came out 8 years ago, and it still sounds fresh. Track 3. Big Ole words(Damn), track 12. Getting Grown, and track 13. bass head jazz, are definitely the stand out tracks for me!My review purposefully does not try to categorize the sound on this album because it pulls from so many different genres, which he then mixes with his very sharp lyrics, and slightly off-key southern baptist church style vocals.Give this album a listen, I doubt there will be another hip-hop album like this for a long time."
5,Cee-lo review,"This album is good, in fact it was much better than I thought it would be. Check it out if you are looking for something different."
4,Just Good Music,I love his style and like the idea of listening to something that sounds good and not like the top 40 that you hear on every radio station. I'm not disappointed.
5,A Classic,"It's been a few years since I read this book, but it's still one of the best books I've ever read. Stone is a great writer, and he offers rich, incisive portraits of the many failed presidential aspirants. It is always possible to disagree with the conclusions of such a subjective study. But Stone writes so well that many of his descpriptions are still etched in my memory. Especially for someone who loves presidential politics, as I do, this book is a masterpiece. It is a shame that he isn't around to update his study. We need more political writers like Stone."
1,Not worth .01!,"Nothing works, the program crashes the computer, contacted manufacturer several times, no response!Save your money!"
1,Underperformer,"Don't buy this book for the following reasons: a) contents contains no new insights whatsoever compared to other books, information available on the internet b) the style is irritant. Author keeps referring the topics that will be discussed further on. A complete waste of money."
5,Everything in One Place,"Just got my copy. I'm excited - there is so much info here; all the questions I have about level ll interpretation and order execution seem to be answered here. And concisely, I might add. There is so much info out there on the www, most is confusing. I'd like to congratulate the author - good job. I've been looking for this book for 2 years! Finally all the info I've read about execution and level ll makes sense. This guy knows his stuff - and he can EXPLAIN it! Beats reading the documentation at the SEC and Nasdaq; thats for sure. This may sound like spam, but I can't say how glad I am to finally have all this info at my fingertips. All the reviews on the cover strike me as accurate, having read the book."
3,Garbo/The Single Standard/Silent,"This is a home video VHS tape of The Single Standard (1929) which came packaged in its original plastic sales box. The film is considered noteworthy because it depicts Greta Garbo as a modern woman, not in a vamp or historical role. Arden (Garbo) challenges the prevailing ""double standard"" with life-changing results. Fans will like the picture for what it is--a silent film with beautiful Garbo and handsome Nils Asther as her lover. There are shots on a boat called All Alone that are real and appealing.This is a Garbo film that one might want to see repeatedly, as the actress projects a range of emotions and is, as always, a star of enormous talent and appeal. This is the picture in which Greta Garbo wore slacks and began a trend for herself and many others."
5,An Honest Writing,"This book was very informative and honest in its writing. It tells of a small powerful group in Israel. ""The Jewish Fundamentalists"". It is not a book about all Jews in Israel as was stated in the one star review from Boca Raton Fl. I do not think this person read this book. If he did he would give an honest review. The author is Jewish so if he was an anti-semite he would be a self hater. I do not think he hates himself. This book is a must for any student of the middle-east"
2,You have got to be kidding,"I know little of Judaism and therefore must rely on the expertise of the writers to evaluate the book's worth. On that basis, the quality of the book must be uneven.Mezvinsky was trained as a historian but his publication list is poor indeed. Most of his writing seems to be for popular magazines like the ""Washington Report on Middle East Affairs."" He has very few publications of a truly scholarly nature and many of those were collections of other people's work that he had edited. I have read a fair number of books written by scholars of the Middle East and can't remember a single one ever citing Mezvinsky's work.There is nothing in Mezvinsky's list of publications that even remotely suggests that he has any expertise on Judaism as a religion.Incidentally, years ago, Moshe Menuhin wrote a book entitled Jewish Critics of Zionism. In his book, he described Mezvinsky as a ""clever but arrogant and presumptuous fellow."""
1,misinformation,"The book, co-authored Shahak is grounded in the assumption that Judaism is inherently bad. Shahak, a chemistry professor was better known for his condemnation of Israel and Jews. Among Shahak's many tidbits of misinformation are false allegations that Jews don't use ""+"" symbols in arithmetic because they are ""crosses,"" and the false allegation that observant Jews ritually defile Christian cemeteries. They also provide misinformation on the Talmud and Kabbalah. Although one can find excellent English translations in context of Talmud and much of the Kabbalah and even online information, most people may well rely on a published book like this. Those that do will be grossly misinformed."
5,Awarded Rosette Award from Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music,"The Glazunov piece is amazing! I highly recommend that as an MP3 download. The entire album is good, but the violin playing in the Glazunov is very special.This album received a Rosette designations from Penguin Guide. It also received a strong review from Gramophone, which called it ""a confident, abundantly characterful account... Znaider brings an extra lyrical ardour and tender intimacy to Prokofiev's soaring melodies, not to mention a greater rhythmic swagger in the finale. But what really lifts this account to special heights is the chamber-like rapport and concentration Znaider generates with Mariss Jansons and the Bavarian Radio SO...""If you have an MP3 player, download the Glazanov for sure. I have not heard better. The Tchaikovsky is excellent. The Prokofiev is very good, but I have heard just as good elsewhere."
4,Managing Investment in Learning,"Investing in learning requires boldness, persistence and vision.This book brings together the annual reflections of one who led from the front for over 10 years. In times of stress and retrenchment in a number of university systems this book deserves to be read by all who aim to make universities institutions that help build worthwhile human futures."
5,A Brilliant insight to a brilliant mind,"F. Lee Bailey is as much a part of our history as were the clients he represented. This in-depth look at the thought process and strategy behind the courtroom drama that flooded millions of our TV screens in the 60s & 70s, reads better than some of the best selling John Grisham fiction Novels of today. Bailey's brave & cutting edge style of Legal defense unfolds in this book, and I found myself reading on & on with anticipation & excitement even though I already knew the outcome of most of the cases. Hats off to Mr. Bailey & may something be learned from him by everyone."
2,Interesting if you can see the book around his big head.,"The Defense Never Rests is an interesting view into the career of one of the most famous lawyers in the United States. From O.J. Simpson to Sam Sheppard (sp?), F. Lee Bailey has been at the forefront of many famous and infamous trials.Unfortunately what would have been a nice snapshot and insight into a legal career, the book is marred by Bailey's ego. In the cases that he won, he says it was a triumph of justice. Those he lost were when the legal system failed. Hmm...You often get the impression when reading through the cases in the book that he writes what he wishes he would have said in those situations. I find it hard to believe that someone can make every comment or quotation perfect as he says throughout the book.I would recommend this book to anyone who has a particular interest in law, but only someone with a strong stomach. Some of Bailey's cases are genuinely interesting, but many are just self-inflated ego trips."
1,Very disappointing,"I had already painted my 2-car garage floor twice in 10 years...the car tires always led the way for peeling throughout the floor....so I followed the prep directions for this product to the letter, scraping off old paint for days and even kept the cars off for the new surface for a full week....well it took only 2 DAYS for the car tires to start pulling up the surface. With the prior two paint jobs, it took several weeks for the paint to peel...I feel I should be compensated for the all the time I put in....."
4,One of their best,"Being a fan of the more recent melodic direction of the band (since Tuonela), I was extremely pleased upon my first listen to this album, and with each subsequent listen I like it more and more. ""Day Of Your Beliefs"" is perhaps my favorite Amorphis song so far from any album. While this album is not quite as strong overall as Am Universum, it is a worthy successor. The title track is also excellent, as well as ""Evil Inside"" and ""Ethereal Solitude"". ""Killing Goodness"" provides a ""Children of the Grave"" (Sabbath) type vibe, which is always good! Go to their website and order the CD single for ""Evil Inside"" to get two more bonus tracks; ""Shining Turns To Gray"" and ""Follow Me Into The Fire"". Great stuff. Bravo!"
2,Get a new singer!,"It is a real shame that the singer is so off on this album. It is a really good album musically but vocally, it lacks. The singer has no range and comes off sounding really off key sometimes.....especially track #2. I have been listening to metal for over 10 years now and I know a good album when I hear it. I will try to give this one a few more tries. If you want a good melodic death metal allbum try out Insomnium's newest ""Since it all came down""."
4,a solid debut,"Custom bursts out with clever lyrics on views ranging from sex to love and anger to hate.With help from Duncan Shiek,the music hits hard from begining to end with an abundance of diversity.I highly recommend this album to put you in a rockin' mood.Peace, love and brown rice.Yeah,Yeah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Great songs!,"It's sad that there's been nothing else from Custom since 2007 but it shows they really put their heart into their only CD. All of their songs are decent and fun to listen to. Some of the notables ones to listen to:- One Day- Hey Mister (which was banned from MTV -- you know, when they used to play music of course before they apparently banned all music...)- DaddyTheir music can go from mellow-like sounds to personal anger issues, while not being over the top. They remind me a bit of Scapegoat Wax and are definitely a band that you haven't heard of but need to listen to and at the very least give a try."
3,Was a gift,Not my cup of tea but it was a gift for someone and it has been discontinued to being able to find it on Amazon and inexpensive was awesome!
2,Hey Mister... what happened?!,"After much anticipation, I bought this cd the day it was released. I loved the song ""Hey Mister"" on the radio, so I thought that the rest of the cd couldn't be too bad either. Unfortunately I was wrong. Other than the previously mentioned track there is absolutely nothing appealing on this cd. I couldn't name a single track that stuck in my head or that I'd listen to again.I'm not saying the music is terrible because it's not. It's just that every song sounds about the same and doesn't ever grab you like it should. The bottom line is I paid 15.99 on the day of release for one song. Don't make the same mistake."
1,dude maybe you should quit smoking,"I listened to this CD, or I should say I tried to listen to the CD, but I couldn't figure out what was trying to say the words. I thought it might be a man, but I know that can't be because men usually have voices like all other humans. I figure a mad scientist must have re-animated a dead lizard just long enough to record some slop. The music, on the other hand, reminds me of a ...[dis-oriented] Onesidezero who can't figure out what instruments to use or even how to play them. Don't mistake me, Onesidezero is a cool band."
4,Nautica N12529G Mens,"For the price, this is a very good looking watch with good features. The calendar is large and easy to read, the dual time is a great feature and easy to set. The screw in crown makes it watertight, so no worrys when it gets wet. It is a bit thick (13mm), but most watches with these features are. Overall, I am very happy with this watch."
4,Looks very good,"Bought it from Dillards, looks very good and versatile as dress watch or party watch with the more modern crocodile leather design."
3,"Great music - but not a performance edition, imho","There's plenty of great music here, but the print is too small in my opinion to be easily visible from a piano bench. And there are no fingerings provided.For these reasons, I'd calling this a ""study edition"" rather than a ""performing edition."""
1,"Spartan, uninspired kids rooms","I was very disappointed in this book. There were very few pages dealing with baby's rooms, regardless of the title. This author (a photography stylist...NOT an interior designer) has an apparent fear of color and visual interest. If your tastes run to the highly modern and institutional, you may find some inspiration, but if your interested in anything other than cold, white, spartan surroundings for your child, I'd steer clear of this book. Granted, the photography of these sterile rooms is lovely...but I was not interested in how to stylishly photograph unadorned spaces...I was looking for inspiration to create an imaginative, innovative nursery for my son. I also purchased her other book focused more exclusively on babies...and was even more surprised at her take on the ideal surroundings for babies. They looked like elegant snapshots of an underfunded orphanage. At least I purchased the book used. Keep looking!"
2,OK,nothing you can't find online for free on any design blog. only worth buying if you are buying second hand.
3,A long long line,"As a collector of small hand drawn or hand written journals, I was happy to add this one to my bookshelf. It is a fascinating account of an elderly man's walk (with only a knapsack) from Le Havre to Rome. That fact alone I found awesome!! He records his days with keen perception and charming drawings, and the writing--what I could read of it--is quite interesting. His drawings are charming and quite wonderful. My main complaint is that it is rather difficult to read what he wrote, and his journey was so interesting, I felt cheated when I couldn't make it out....hence the three stars. But it is unique among the flurry of little books like this which have been published in the last five years. An evening with a book like this, with its quirky little handwritten comments and completely individual drawings, is an enjoyable antidote to the rigid world of computers, instant copies, and fax machines."
2,"taking a line for a walk: 1100 miles on foot, le havre to rome","Having read a couple of other travel sketch books, I had great anticipation for the arrival of Taking a Line for a Walk. I am very disappointed in the tiny format. The sketches are sweet, but I really would like to read the handwritten remarks."
5,The Tarot According To You,"Exceedes Excellence! I have both of Nancy Garen's Tarot Books and I *TREASURE* them. ""The Tarot According To You"" offers the reader the opportunity to actually *learn* the tarot without making it difficult. It also urges the reader to look within for answers, instead of without, or to other people. The meditations included with many of the cards are fantastic! This book moves beyond ""what does the card mean"", into ""what does the card mean to *me* and how does it relate to my PRESENT situation"". ""The Tarot According To You"", along with ""The Tarot Made Easy"", are essential to all libraries!"
5,Thought Provoking,I have to say this is a great book. It forces you to think about what the card means to you. Most books just give interpretations. I highly recommend this book.
4,Great Buy!,"I bought this book from an Amazon dealer, because I guess it's out of print(?). Anyway, I am currently working in the workbook and it's been right on. If you want to develop a relationship between tarot and your life, then this is the book to get. At first, I didn't know if I could really do all that journaling and I thought about just getting rid of it. I put an ad for it on FreeCycle, and neither one of the people that were interested picked it up. I took that as a sign that I should keep it and I'm glad I did!"
1,Mini Craft Iron,I find that the cord positioned on the left side makes the iron awkward to use. For a right-handed person using the iron backwards is easier. The cord though needed for the amount of current is like having a cricket on the end of a chain often keeping the iron from easily sitting flat. I will continue to use my larger iron.
1,Safety issue: Lead in the cord,"What the description does not tell you, and what you don't find out until you destroy the clamshell packaging to get the iron out (thus eliminating any chance of returning the item!) is this paragraph in the iron's Safety Precautions:CAUTION -- PROP 56 WARNING: Handling the coated electrical wires of this product exposes you to lead, a chemical known to the State of California to cause Cancer, birth defects, and other reproductive harm. Wash hands after use.Another problem with this iron: the plate has imperfections. There are extra bits of teflon-like stuff on the surface of the plate, meaning that it is not flat like it should be."
2,Does the job....barely.,"This little iron is does an ok job for what I was looking for - something small to press seams while sewing. It does fine for that, but certainly wouldn't work at getting out any kind of wrinkles."
2,Too cool,Even heating the bottom of this thing up a bit more with a small torch couldn't hardly make it sustain enough heat to use the iron on denim patch I had.
1,Cord Won't Stay Attached! :-(,"The cord comes out frequently. It's frustrating to be pressing my quilt pieces and have the iron cold without power. I won't buy another one of these. It's a cute size and light to carry, but there are better, less frustrating options on the market than this craft iron."
4,Very good,"I found all I wanted to know about menopause and I am very happy to have found it.The only thing I miss in the book is a remark about soya products and how they act negatively on Tiroids, especially if you have hypotiroism how this products block their working."
2,Warning!,"I had to comment, because our magazine, The Pulse of Oriental Medicine, has received several ""heads ups"" about some advice Christiane gave... she suggested taking the Chinese patent herb remedy ""Yunnan Baiyao"" before surgery. I and other Chinese Medical experts believe this is an extremely risky idea.#1- Yunnan Baiyao stops bleeding... it affects wound-healing. Herbs of this type can have life-threatening interactions with some drugs.#2- Because of #1, Yunnan Baiyao could alter your response to procedures or drugs, placing your surgeon in an unfamiliar medical landscape, especially if he/she doesn't know you've taken the herbs. Even if they did, not enough is known about how it might interact with the drugs administered before and during surgery.Don't risk it!Christian says that the patent ""has been used successfully"" in this way. There is no reference or source for this. I have no idea what made her think this was a good idea, and she doesn't tell us."
4,Good info but her style is annoying,"This book has a HUGE amount of good information and covers many different facets of perimenopause and menopause. I do wonder how much of this information may have changed since it was published a while ago, but its a great foundation to start with. It definitely has made me understand what might be going on with me - especially some of the more frigthening things.I do think the book is way too long and rambling. And most annoying is the author's assumption that her audience is married with kids and unhappy with their husbands (just like her!) If you don't fit into that category you can skip the first chapter or so and just read the parts that don't focus about her particular experience."
2,What about us Non-Unfulfilled Women?,"I found this book to be a treatise on Dr. Northrup's personal life. I'm sorry she was unfulfilled till she got her divorce. As I read along, trying as hard as I could to approach it with an open mind, I kept looking for advice for women like me who ARE in partnership, equal, happy marriages, doing what they want with their lives, but yet showing signs of perimenopause.Dr. Northrup found emotional cause for her fibroids, which I have a hard time buying into. I need a book with less hocus-pocus and more hard scientific information, undiluted with the new age approach."
4,Useful Reading for Menopausal Women,"The first few chapters of this book seem to be used to justify/rationalize the author's divorce and to push the practice of mysticism. However, the remainder of the book is full of excellent, practical advice regarding menopause. Dr. Northrup combines traditional medicine with other ""medicines"" in a nice balance."
1,Hogwash!,"This book has so many stupid ideas, that I can not mention them all.For example.... she suggests that because you might have lived in an unhappy marriage (or situation) you swallowed your words and that is why you have a thyroid problem!!! Ridiculous.She recommends chucking your marriage if you get in menopause and your goals change...I would NOT recommend this book. There were a few parts that seemed to be realistic to me, but it was outweighed by the 'new age' junk.Skip this one!"
1,Tape for Sale - Cheap!,"This is a single, relatively short cassette. It is NOT a reading from the book. It was taped while being delivered to a live audience.The doctor's goals to teach and inform were compromised by her needs to 'entertain' and establish rapport with the audience. There are multiple outbursts/interruptions as she elicited responses from the audience. They waste time. The producer did not modulate the volume, and the audience outbursts are often shockingly loud compared to the volume of the vocal presentation. I raised and lowered the volume throughout the tape trying to compensate.Dr. Northrup makes several references to information being presented to the audience via visual aids. That info is lost to those who are listening to the tape. If you have seen Dr. Northrup's presentations on talk shows or PBS you won't gain much if any additional information from this tape. Put your money into the book if you want to learn more. Sandy"
1,"Women, don't be fooled!","This books is a load of hype. Northrup is a new-agey. unorthodox practitioner in my humble opinion.I bought it innocently, thinking she would have tons of information regarding menopause and its symptoms and treatments, only to find to my dismay that there is just to much ""questionable advice"" and unsubstantiated dictates. For example, taking CoEnzyme Q10, which she highly recommends, may be fine after it is proven to be effective for menopausal women in clinical trials, but where is the backup? Where is the proof?I am sorry I spent the money for this book. It is going in the trash, where it belongs."
2,Not far enough,"The Wisdom of Menopause provides an accurate description of what happens to a woman's body during and after ovarian failure (menopause). This book describes in detail the negative effects of menopause (ovarian failure) while still describing it as a natural and normal process to embrace. I don't believe we should be so willing to allow our ovaries to fail, instead we should look for ways to help them work better and for longer."
1,The Spiritism of Christiane Northrup,"How very disappointing that Dr. Northrup is all caught up in ""New Age"" Spiritualism. She calls it ""Wisdom""; I'd call it Superstition. I had hoped for a good scientific reference work. Instead, it was very hard to read: difficult to get past her absurd analyses of the ""causes"" of various health problems. She continually ""blames the victim""--i.e. If a woman has a hormone related health problem, she needs to look within and change her life (Therefore, it must be her fault?!) Spend your money on a better book."
2,Dr. Northrup missed some very valuable information,"I recently purchased and read this book and feel that while it contains some valuable information, many important facts were left out. Dr. Northrup is so high on progesterone that she is unable to communicate the fact that this hormone can also cause some troubling side effects. Think about how you feel during the last half of your cycle when progesterone is dominant....mood swings, weight gain, headaches, anxiety etc.. Now, tell me that you want to feel that way all of the time?? I think not. I recommend a fantastic book titled ""screaming To Be Heard"" (sorry, unable to underline) by Elizabeth Lee Vliet. Dr. Vliet gives you BOTH sides of the progesterone story.... please educate yourself before making such important life choices!!"
1,Disappointed,"Right off the bat, she portrays menopause as a time to really see how horrible your marriage has been along and get out of it! ""I had to grow or die . . ."" Then she expounds upon the fact that she's into astrology, psychics, mysticism and tarot cards. A little too bizarre for me."
2,No Wisdom,"The author has a lot of problems that have nothing to do with menapause. Her personal issues and lack of grounding will only add confusion to the average woman who is looking for direction. The author who is obviously unhappy with life wants to seek a complete new and questionable value system. I think most women will only be cast adrift using the book for ""wisdom""."
5,Simply a bible ...,"... that we must have nowadays, when General Practitioners are either misinformed, not updated at all, or not interested in giving the facts. It's a vital book if we want to make sure that our health will not drastically suffer because of ignorance; it's also very informative on products and other resources available in the market today."
1,How far back do you guys go?,"Fellows- I purchased this hardcover book over 10 years ago from Amazon. My wife read it, not me, and I have no idea what it was about. I'm flat out remembering what books I read a months ago."
3,LOVE THE BOOK ----BUT IT WAS NOT NEW,"WAS DISSAPPOINTED WHEN I RECEIVED MY BOOK AND IT WAS SUPPOSE TO BE NEW. YOU COULD TELL IT HAD BEEN USED. OTHERWISE, I DO LIKE THE CONTENTS AND THE GOOD DOCTOR IS VERY INFORMATIVE ABOUT WHAT A WOMAN GOES THRU IN LIFE. I KEEP THIS BOOK CLOSE BY TO LOOK UP INFORMATION WHEN NEEDED. EVERY WOMEN SHOULD READ THIS BOOK."
2,Angry chick has some good info,"When I read the jacket, I was impressed that this book was being heartily endorsed by some heavy hitters, so I bought it. I should have read a little more closely -- most of the impressive endorsements are for the author's FIRST book, and it's easy to see why. She has some good information, but when she casually mentions that she let her fibroid grow to the size of a SOCCER BALL before doing something real about it (shrinking it through visualization hadn't quite done the trick), I could no longer hang in there for her incessant rants about her ex-husband, or her praise for a woman who could diagnose a patient without ever having seen or spoken to her. Northrup seems to vascillate between intelligent and irresponsible."
2,Save Your Money,"I was very disappointed when I read this book. I had seen the author on [a show] one day when I was home suffering with the flu. The show made me want to read this book because I thought it would answer many of my questions about perimenopause. Instead I found the book to be depressing and full of the author's own issues...issues that frankly have less to do with mid-life hormonal changes than her personal marital crisis. We all have our issues, but I was looking for fact based information, not self-justification. Yes, there was some information in the book I found interesting, but not enough."
2,"Lost Credability, QUICKLY!!","I admit, I haven't finished this book. A friend recommended it to me as I have been having problems with insomnia. I was interested in reading a book about women's health issues and this one sounded intriguing UNTIL she started in with her tarot cards, interest in astrology and angels. Granted, I am not a firm believer in just ""the hard facts"" but its really hard to believe anything this woman writes after it is clear that common sense isn't alternative enough for her!!"
5,Finally and in depth guide.,"This is an incredible book for women of any age. It is concise, factual and one of the most in depth guides to women's health not only at menopause but during your entire life that I have ever read. It gives you choices as far as medical approaches to your health and well being as well as holistic and spiritual guidance. It is something every woman should read. Once you finish this book, believe me, you will understand yourself and others much better. Read it today."
2,Wisdom of Menopause Audio Tape Opinion,"I ordered the audio tape, thinking I would be listening to Dr. Northrup reading the book, as Dr. Phil read his book, ""Self Matters""., and then I could keep the hard copy of the book on my shelf for reference. With only one tape, there is no way that Dr. Northrup covered what's in her book. The tape should be sub-titled as a lecture to a group of women, which is exactly what it is, not the unabridged version of the book. ..."
4,Great Reference...loaded with good info,"I must admit the astrology and tarot card stuff was quite odd. However, overall, the book is a great reference on menopause. It is an easy read...a wealth of information. I would buy it again."
3,"A Good Start, but Needs More Focus to Be Truly Helpful","This book has some very useful information, but there is no attempt to discuss the research base for complementary treatments. For example, there is research accumulating that black cohosh and flaxseeds are safe and effective measures for hotflashes and other menopause changes.As host of the menopause web site for bellaonline.com, I get a lot of questions from women about these approaches. I wish Dr. Northrup had examined the better researched ones instead of discussing Tarot cards. Also, her discussion of her own divorce took away from the focus of the book.In many health care situations, it is often the nurse or nurse practitioner who answers women's menopause questions and I'm looking forward to a book that presents menopause from this point of view.Carolyn Chambers Clark, RN, ARNP, EdDBoard-Certified Holistic Practitionerhttp://Menopause.bellaonline.com"
5,You're Not Alone!,"This excellent overview of what happens to women in menopause and perimenopause isn't just a laundry list of symptoms, or the usual hormone-centric look at the issue. Instead, Dr. Northrup cites examples from her own passage, turning the text into a mind-body-spirit analysis of how menopause is literally the ""change of life.""The most fascinating aspect of the book is the author's description of how women's actual brain wiring changes during menopause -- from the selfless nurturing of the childbearing years to a more autonomous focus during the second half of life.The best aspect is the book's focus on empowerment, and how women who understand the process of menopause can use the changes they're going through to reassess their lives.A must-read for every woman, no matter how old they are."
1,an odd mix,"An odd mix of medical information and pop psychology. For example, here's an excerpt from p.119: ""In many women thyroid disfunction develops because of an energy blockage in the throat region, the result of a lifetime of 'swallowing' words she is aching to say."" This kind of writing may be just your cup of tea, but I found it hard to swallow."
3,Imformative but have read better!,"This book did not tell me anything new I did not already know about. I started going through Menopause 2 years ago, approx., the end of 1999. I tried over the counter herbal supplements for 1 year and had no results. I am now on HRT, Prempro is the name of the hormone I take and have taken since July 22, 2001. Please read a book title ""Get Off the Menopause Roller Coaster"" by Shari Leiberman, Ph.D., CNS, FACN. It is wonderful and tells you just about everything you need to know. Good luck to any of you women going through this now. By the way, I am 50 years young! :) And what a big difference Hormone Replacement Therapy has done for me and my life!"
3,Men-o-pause?,"This book has some useful information about dealing with menopause, especially for women who are looking for alternative remedies and approaches.I felt, however, that Dr. Nortrup is trying to validate her own failed marriage by encouraging women to leave their husbands as soon as the hot flashes start in order to find peace and joy. Of course, I'm exaggerating, but case study after case study cites women who leave their mates if they don't understand them. And these aren't abusive relationships--just difficult ones. I was also put off by what she called the spiritual dimension of her life--Tarot cards and astrology. Come on! From a medical doctor?Read the book for good ideas on understanding your body and nutrition during menopause. But trusting a medical doctor for spiritual advice is like having your priest work on your car."
5,The Wisdom Of Menopause,"I ordered this book for my daughter, and it arrived at her house in good condition and in a short period of time, she and I were both happy and satisfied with the service we received. We will both order more books with an assurance of great service.Linda Creech"
1,No Horoscope Please,The author's pervasive interest in occult practices such as astrology and tarot card strained her credibility to the point that I returned this book. Inclusion of religious beliefs whether they are conventional or new age are incompatible with the standards of objectivity one would expect in publications involving personal medical matters.
3,"Good material., badly edited","The material is good, interesting and usefull, but very badly printed: you never got the diagrams where you expect them to be, right by the text talking about them. It shouldn't have been a big affort to make the text and the images fitting... The result is a difficult reading and a confusional effect."
2,Sketchy treatments at best,"The patterns in here are brief, which should not be a problem. But the examples do not do the patterns justice. The first pattern I picked out used a ""foo"" and ""bar"" example -- why even bother providing an example if you cannot make it concrete? I had to read many of the patterns several times before understanding them. Overall, I found this book more difficult than the original Design Patterns. This stuff is really not that hard, and Patterns in Java doesn't do much to clarify things."
2,Dissappointing.,"The code examples are sketchy and incomplete, and often utilize techniques that may be good practice but that obfuscate the concept the reader is trying to learn.For example his coverage of the Delegation pattern (which I have yet to see documented in any other book, I'm still looking :) is verbosely explained but the accompanying example code is so vague and has so many ...'s as to be almost unusable."
4,Helpful for learning,"If you are a hands on Java programmer and want the design patterns explained as you can understand them in code, this book is worth it. I notice other reviewers slate this book, picking up on what they consider to be ""errors"". Well, ultimately GOF4 is always going to be the authority on patterns but GOF4 is very dry - this book gives a practical java code explanation of the patterns. I often browse through it looking for ideas."
2,No substitute for GoF,"Because I'm a Java programmer and think UML is cool, I chose this book over GoF, and I was disappointed. The writing style is bland, the examples aren't so useful, and it's not always easy to find the pattern you're looking for."
1,Total Disgrace of a Book,"I was excited when this book came out and bought it w/o hesistation. Unfortunately, after reading the book I came to realize that the author has only a superficial understand of design patterns, what's even worse is some of his explanations were completely off the mark! This book should never had been published and is ample testament to the poor quality of recent books released by the publisher.Anyone claiming that this book is 5 stars is totally clueless or is in someone's payroll."
1,Low standards,"The beginner will be challenged by myriad inaccuracies, inconsistencies and typos. The veteran will be surprised by the author's inaccurate treatment of the examples he borrows from Go4 (""Design Patterns"" / Gamma et al), and will be annoyed by the book's numerous ""forward-dependencies"" on Volume 2 (still unpublished!). This book fails to live up to its potential as a new catalog of design patterns, because of the author's lack of mastery both of the essence of those patterns and of their clear presentation. Having said that, the author should be praised for his ground-breaking attempt to present a comprehensive introductory book combining design patterns, java, and uml."
2,Full of typos and badly formed code,"(I just read everything, from the intro, mini case study, to the first few patterns.) Like others have stated, this book is full of distracting typos and lots of misindented and broken code. Many of the long descriptions are confusingly worded and peppered with bad grammer, such as runon sentences and missing commas. I will never buy a Mark Grand book again without being able to easily return it (ala amazon.com). My opinion of Wiley as a publisher has gone down a few notches for letting such a low quality book get published."
1,A shocker!,"Oh my, that this book misses the mark so badly is laughable (you have to laugh or you'll cry!). The author doesn't truly understand the subject matter at all with numerous bad implementations of the GoF patterns. This shows a lack of true understanding of the GoF patterns in the first place as well as a lack of true understanding of Java (interfaces leaps out as an example here).I agree with another reviewer. The only book worse than this is Volume 2."
3,good parts,"Bought this book for my nephew. His comment was ""there are a lot of good parts, but you have to search for them."""
4,Approachable and informative,"As well as it's intended purpose to describe patterns in java terms I've found some very useful coding snippets extra over the pattern descriptions. I've learnt more about the jdk packages from the books frequent referal to pattern usage in the java api. Only 4 stars though; the book has many typographical errors and the layout could be better - especially the page headings, chapter number and chapter name; it would be much more useful to have chapter name, pattern name instead; I hope the author can manage this in his follow up volume which I will certainly buy."
5,The patterns book for Java,"Just a quick one I'm afraid. Having bought this book yesterday I'm pleased to see that it covers not only new patterns but also GoF ones from a Java perspective. Whilst patterns can often be language neutral, having someone ground them in your current implementation language makes understanding them much easier. I was pleased with Larman's book earlier this year but it's focus was more towards the software lifecycle. ""Patterns in Java"" covers the UML language enough so that you can understand the diagrams in the following sections. It also briefly covers the lifecycle, but the main focus is definiately on usable, realistic patterns to help you solve specific problems. This book is a pre-requistite to designing any vaguely complex Java application. If you were holding off by the Gang of Four book until it was updated for Java, don't wait anymore. Buy this instead."
5,Just what I needed,Have been looking for a java centred patterns book for some time and this fits the bill. Very useful examples and I particularly liked the way that examlples of a pattern's use in the jdk are highlighted.
1,"Patterns in Java, Volume 1","This is a book which illustrates strongly the old saying ""Don't judge a book by its cover."" The title of the book was so attractive that almost every Java Developers that I know of bought it for reference. However, it turns out to be a nightmare to most. The material in the book was so poorly explained that I got lost reading it even after a few times. Sometimes, the author tried to illustrate the implementation of the Pattern by presenting a Java Code fragment. the code was so incomplete that I had no idea what is going on. Furthermore, in the chapter about Snapshot Pattern. The author first describes the pattern by mentioning a typical computer game example which is an interesting introduction. He should have explained more based on this example instead he confused readers by mentioning about serialisation and jump straight to game model class without any class diagrams."
1,Disgrace!,"I pity the individual whom selected this book as their first exposure to Design Patterns. A total abuse to the Java programming language or any language. After reviewing Mark's explanation of the Composite and State Patterns, they were far from ""Grand"". Illustrations are incorrect or incomplete; I am not sure which. The coding examples do not reinforce reusability and are incorrectly implemented. USING CASE LOGIC FOR THE STATE PATTERN! I nearly lost my lunch.On your next camping trip, take this book with you; it will make a great firelog. NOW THAT'S REUSABILITY!!"
4,I guess Mark isn't a member of the communist party,"...I've read about 8 or 9 patterns in Grand's book. The writing is good, and clear, but lacks the snooty vocabulary of Rational publications (thank goodness!). I think this book is an excellent resource - to the point, and if you don't know C++ or SmallTalk, you'll get a lot more out of this book than you will from Gamma et al."
4,Decent,"Informative, even though author ""invents"" a few patterns that are not part of the known lists (e.g. the Gang of Four encyclopedia)."
3,Other Java Design books,"I read the first chapter of this book and it does seem easier than the Gof book, although the reviews scare me away. On the other hand I'm afraid I'll get confused with the multiple inheiritance of C++ in Gof. Another book to consider is Bruce Eckel's java design patterns book. It isn't out yet, but it's at his web site. I liked his book about object oriented programming. Maybe I'll just print it out."
4,John Karlen is Willie Loomis,"Willie Loomis was played for 4 episodes by actor James Hall. As this tape's cover indicate, this tape features the debut of actor John Karlen in this role. Karlen would play Loomis for the rest of the series. I don't know why Mr. Hall was replaced, but those of us familiar with John Karlen's work are happy and relieved to see him appear.Otherwise, this tape features a lot of Willie leering greedily at the large jewels in the family portrait of Barnabas Collins, and at any young women he might run into. Carolyn Stoddard actually pulls a gun on him at one point. The show is just a few days away from getting really interesting."
3,"Solid, but outdated","This is a good book to learn the basics of networking from. Sadly, it is extremely outdated (it has a lot of details about Token Ring, for example, and focuses on NT 4) and has not received a refresh. But if you are looking for a comprehensive book to learn the rock bottom fundamentals of networking, this is a decent choice. I am sure that there are comparable, modern books out there, but I am not aware of them off hand."
5,Decidedly different and delightful,"If you really want to know about Wales before you travel this is the guide for you. This is a book to be read and digested not just skimmed through. It is rich in history, art and literature. It gives a deep understanding of the people, the land and its culture. It is not a travel guide per se but will certainly inform your travels. This is not for the lets hit the high points crowd."
5,Stupid Comments,None of the reviewers actually talked about the contents or value of the book. I don't care whether they are for or against hunting. Either read and rate the book or shut up.
3,This Is Bleak Stuff Folks ...,"This is a vivid, intense, and ultimately overwrought book, about a Mexican Indian girl who is forcibly separated from her three year old daughter. Susan Straight has a whole lot to say about the plight of the illegal immigrant and those that live on the fringes of our society. She plunges the reader into the horrors of migrant labor with examples of violence, prevalent drug use, and sexual predation. Her characters are great-hearted people, with big dreams, but instead of focusing on the plot (how about some interaction between the main characters?!?!), Susan Straight instead chooses to hit us over the head with her thoughts on love, race, and class."
2,A novel or a sermon?,"To be fair, the author was poetic with her words. But she got lost in what felt like a moral crusade to preserve life. The reading felt choppy with points of view just popping up for no apparent reason, with chapters hinging on unbelievable details (like a guy having sex with his girlfriend and not noticing she is five months pregnant.), with main characters acting deliberately dumb. It was painful to read. I can tell the author has a gift with words and hope next time she doesn't get lost preaching to the masses."
5,A Must Read!,This book is excellent. Susan Straight is an awesome writer. I own all of her novels...this is a great addition to any collection.
4,"Good collection, but....","This is a very good early collection of stories done in the Gullah vernacular commonly found among Blacks in the Charleston SC-Savannah Ga. area. However, Gonzales did his job a bit too well in that his phonetic recitations of these tales are almost indecipherable to those not famimiar with the dialect. Folklorists may also be interested to know that some of these tales make reappearances in Joel Chandler Harris' ""Uncle Remus"" tales (which came out at around the same time, so it may be the other way around) and some forty years later in the collections of the Black folklorist Zora Neale Hurston. But either way, if you have the patience, give it a try. BUT BE WARNED-Once you get the flow of the dialougue, these stories were written from a very patronizing point of view in the early 1900s and the politically correct may want to take some heart medicine before reading this."
2,Vista users stay away,"This joystick is very old. No vista drivers. With plenty of searching one might be lucky to get drivers for XP. My advice is spend the extra cash and get a Logitech Extreme 3D Pro, a joystick that is much better and compatible with wider range of operating systems."
3,Sterling Silver Lime Quartz Stud Earrings,These earrings are knock-your-eyes-out large! They are pretty but don't seem to sit right on my ears. I like them anyway. The lime quartz is pale and sparkly. Think they would be good for someone not as petite as I am. They stand out from the ear like a little box in their setting. I paid $19.00 for them awhile ago and feel they would be good for the right person.They look smaller in the picture.
1,Absolute worst b film I have ever seen!,"I watched this film via an alternative purchase. Don't waste your money on this one! If I could have given it a minus five stars, I would have. I really like a good disaster film, but this was the absolute worst. Cheesy, tacky acting, special effects the same and story line not much better. Asylum should not have produced this film. A five year old probably could have come up with a better film!"
1,worst SY FY ever,"My husband and I watch a lot of SY FY movies. This one takes the cake! We were laughing out loud at all the mistakes as they happened. Just as an example: the movie takes place in and around Los Angeles. They show a map of the super cyclone rolling across southern FLORIDA! Ming-Na is supposed to be from NOAA, she hands someone her card who reads that she is from the National Oceanic Atmospheric ASSOCIATION! Come on! who was consulting on this! What a bomb!"
2,yuk,it is 1 stupid movie i have seen better movies than that . better action movie than this its so fake n stupid
1,Worst Ever,The movie began with a good idea but whoever produced it put no money in it. I have never seen a movie so poorly done. The worst part was that it was filmed in Southern California so the sun was shining all the time even when it was pouring rain or hailing. They drove thru raining oil but when they got out of the car it was sunny again. An entire ship was lifted by a tornado but the people inside we barely moved around. And since it was the stars they weren't hurt. Camera shots were spinning around people or following them down hallways while they talked over and over again. Helicopters were flying into tornadoes and fiery hailstones. Really stupid. If I could I would give it minus 5 stars!
1,TIS AN ILL WIND THAT BLOWS NO GOOD,"SyFy's latest disaster film is really disastrous. SUPER CYCLONE is tedious, laughable, and offers an annoying performance from Ming Na, who I remember from her Judge arc on TWO AND A HALF MEN. Ming has the emotional depth of an oyster. The usually reliable Nicholas Turturro is as stiff as the tailored suit he wears throughout the film. As always, the science is preposterous and there's more talk than action. A good disaster movie should have disaster scenes which SUPER CYCLONE offers very little. It's really a boring waste of time!"
1,We all should have died in the water,"What can be said about bad CGI, bad scripting and universally bad acting? If I had only jumped into the boiling water early on I could have saved myself at least an hour of lame movie-making. About the only way to make this watchable is to have robots and a silly human making snide remarks while eating popcorn in the back of the theatre."
2,Ship forgot to roll,"Normally I would happily watch Ming Na read 'War And Peace' out loud. But this offering was hard to view. Being a retired U.S. Navy CPO, and having been through a few REAL typhoons, I pretty much gave up early on when the actors were bouncing around the wheelhouse as they were being buffeted by the cyclone. I could'nt help but notice that the inclinometer on the bulkhead aft of the binnacle never moved. Oops!"
1,Watched for the humor....,"A friend recommended that we watch this just for the ""awfulness"" of it and he was right! It is so bad that scarcely 30 seconds of the film can pass before your eyes without seeing some horrible mistake. It's beyond obvious that the production company just doesn't care. In all fairness, they are noted for horrible movies."
5,I Liked it A lot,The movie showed what can happen people/companies did to deep in the earth and end up with A disaster on their hands
1,Don't go there,"My laptop came pre-installed with Instant DVD/CD but my experience is the same as many of your other correspondents; I have yet to burn a DVD successfully - it appears to go all the way then either slows to a trickle, never quite completing the burning operation, or simply crashes. Their web-site is no help, I've installed the most up-to-date patches but there's no improvement and apparently no help. I think I will go back to Nero if I can actually remove this successfully from my PC!"
1,Copying DVD's - Don't waste your money!,"I have used several Pinnacle products in the past and when Instant CD/DVD came out I bought the package right away. Having already had a few DVD's ruined with scratches, I thought I would back them up. What a mistake as it turns out Instant CD/DVD will not copy any copy protected movies, and practically all are protected. Buy DVD X Copy or try some of the free programs. Don't waste your money if you are buying to just copy DVD's. If for other reasons, go ahead, as the package has some nice features."
2,Water problem,Not too satisfied the water keeps comming out from place where we put the water for steam
4,Did the job,"The insulation works. I climbed to over 19000ft and the insulation kept the drinking tube on my platypus big zip (3ltr) from freezing. I found the mouthpiece cover very useful too. It kept my mouthpiece relatively clean at lower altitudes as well.What I didn't like was the wrist pain that I got from first putting my drinking tube through the insulation. I don't know if I missed something, but it took about an hour of slowly coaxing the tube through the insulation as it was really tight. I notice now that after use, the insulation moves around quite freely and I bravely pulled it out before sticking the big zip in the dishwasher (as I think reinserting the tube through the insulation would not be as painful).I've heard that the tube/mouthpiece freeze at high altitudes in spite of the insulation. Wasn't the case for me.I think it's a bit expensive though. It would be nice if amazon/platypus had deals on buying a hydration unit with the insulation together."
3,It's OK,"This author did not match my expectations. His stories were brief, no detail and not very convincing. He did not examine the paranormal"
3,OK Book,"Just finished reading ""Ghost House"" and I have to say this was not my favorite ghost house story. It was an OK read. Probably a better book for younger people."
2,doesn't work very well...,Only worked on very smooth glass for us... which was disappointing. But very funny when it does work :)
5,A non-Shafferian play by Shaffer!,"Shaffer's work seems to be synonimous with mystery, impact, ritual and theatrical pyrotechnics. How strange, then, to see him in this, his first major play, to see him attempting something very close to a kitchen sink drama.Indeed, there is a smack of Ibsenesque drawing-room realism so far removed from the 'total theatre' of Equus and Royal Hunt that some readers may find disconcerting. But, nevertheless, Shaffer's tender understanding of the emotional pressures of middle-class family life make this play just as extraordinary and gripping as any of the later, more popular successes.The play does exhibit Shaffer's characteristic love of linguistic versatility and, as with all his plays, is extremely relevent. I for one cannot but feel moved by the characters' tender denunciation of love and sexuality.A must for anyone wanting to find new layers to an original and penetrating writer."
5,Required reference for every speaker,If you can't find a humourous anecdote here you can't find one anywhere. Perfect for the reference shelf of speakers and writers.
2,Bla,"They were not as nice as I wanted them to be, I ended up returning them. I was expecting them to have more ""sparkle"", but they were pretty dull looking."
4,Provocative,This is an interesting and persuasive book that challenges preconceived notions. A good read.
3,A different point of view...,I bought this book on the strength of the Booknotes interview of author Bellow. I mean: how can you possibly end up praising nepotism? What's he got to say about it? The historical material is fascinating in the way that Bellow can show a different side or point-of-view for some famous (and some less famous) historical figures and how nepotism played into their successes (or failures). Less convincing is the set of conclusions he makes from his research. But I still enjoyed the book pretty well. It'll make a good paperback someday.
1,The B.S. of Silver Spoonery,"Bellow's book is a fascinating read; partially because the subject is infuriatingly destructive to any business and partially because Bellow managed to trade on his father's name to get it published. It doesn't mean that I respect Jaimie Wyath or Arlo Guthrie any less -they've cut their own paths successfully with skill and self-reliance.Listen: Nepotism is handing the reigns to family, buddies and cronies. Integrity is when nepotism gets avoided, which is what you may want to do here, unless you need a reason to boil over."
4,Interesting take on a little-examined subject,"It has been said that some things are so common that no one ever bothers to notice it. One of these things is probably nepotism; the topic of this book. Adam Bellow, son of the famous author Saul, looks at the practice, both accepted and expected, over the centuries in multiple societies. Through it all, the author argues the point that nepotism is one of the primary forces that holds societies together; and should not be looked down upon as it commonly is. The book also shows that the US is quite exceptional in its dedication to remove nepotism from public and business life. All in all, a great book to read."
4,"Superb women's reading, best for Pagans.","This book practically leaped off the shelf, into my hands, and I'm so glad that it did! This is easily one of Z's best and most accessible, and she shares well-researched ideas that others often overlook, despite their importance. Her map of what happens in what years of your life... well, that proved amazingly accurate. Almost spooky. I wish I'd had this info fifteen years ago.This book relies heavily on Pagan and Wiccan themes, as well as astrological cycles. If you're offended by them, even slightly, this isn't the book for you.Likewise, though this information is often as true for men as it is for women, most men won't warm to Z's attitudes or writing style.However, if you're a woman who embraces diverse spiritual references and contexts, and can accept the logic (if not the science) of cyclical influences in our lives, this book is compelling. If you're approaching age 30 or 50, this is the road map."
2,Waiting for his awakening,"I thought maybe Stormer had gotten smarter in the intervening years, and added some real factual info to the book...Too bad. Still the same ol' same ol'."
4,Great Ape Friend,"Toy is a very cuddly, appealing soft sculpture. My grandkids love sitting and watching TV with him and even playing ""catch"" with him. Overall, a good purchase. Vendor provided good description and fast service both times I've done business with him/her."
3,Not bad,"I recently purchased a pop up camper and was instructed to make sure to cover the wheels when storing it. I wanted to make sure to protect my investment, but didn't want to break the bank. These are a decent product. They are a medium weight canvas material that do a good job covering the tire. They fit several diameter tires and have a metal wire running through them to ensure they stay on the tire. I like the quality given the price point and would recommend the product as an entry level tire cover."
4,obsession,"The depths of pain inflicted on others have been described more graphically elsewhere.I was intrigued by the depth of focus and energy by a single individual: An individual who will risk everything searching and using his wits to find the truth.Not a pleasant read, but a worth the time."
5,Nazis vs. Newspaper Reporter,"This Forsyth novel is set in Germany in 1963, right after the assassination of President Kennedy. It follows the story of Peter Miller, a German newspaper reporter attempting to discover the whereabouts of a former SS concentration-camp commander that is of particular interest to his personal history. There is lots of intrigue and suspense along the way, one main Nlotline involves the Nazi association ""ODESSA"" and its attempts to find safe haven for ex-SS members in the aftermath of WWII. Forsyth even manages to work in the Mossad and the real life Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal. Supposedly the movie version resulted in the arrest of the true ""Butcher of Riga,"" Eduard Roschmann, by the Argentinian police. According to reports he then skipped bail and died in 1977 in Paraguay. A fascinating story, if you like historical suspense/thrillers, you will love this read."
3,Interesting but...,"Not bad, written after his first novel, the Day of the Jackal. Applying the same formula that immortalised the book as one of the best ever written, the Odessa File is gripping and draws you into the realms of semi-fiction that Forsyth is an expert of. However, I was dissapointed with the ending. Seem more like a story from a TV soap."
3,The Odessa File review,"The Odessa File was a great book. It caught my interest with the first chapter. It was an interesting story with good characters. Also, the more I learned about the SS and Nazi's during WW2 and what they continued to do after the war, the more I know we need to continue to write more books on the subject and remind people of what happened and not let it happen again. It was a good suspenseful novel. I will definitely read more books written by Frederick Forsyth."
4,Skip The Last Half,"The author's description of Nazi attrocities is outstanding!!!!It should be required reading for every class in Holocaust Literature. The book also revealed a great deal of information about the Jewish ghetto in Riga, Latvia that could almost be a book in itself.However, halfway through the book I became very disappointed. The plot degenerated into a cheap thriller. Such a cleverly researched book should never have been coupled with such a poorly written plot.The horrors of The Riga Ghetto recently made news because of an investigation by The Latvian Holocaust Commission. Unfortunatly, even sixty years after the horrors of The Riga Ghetto, The Government of Latvia couldn't overcome it's antisemitism and Abraham Foxman of The World Jewish Congress resigned from the commission."
4,A very good spy novel,Forsyth has written a believable thriller. The book move along with very little padding. The characters are interesting. The interrogation of Miller by the Odessa Chief could have been improved. The questions asked by the interrogator to see if Miller was really a former SS soldier (instead of someone else) appeared to correlate very highly with the training he received. Other than this the book is suspenseful and is hard to put down. Excellent read at 1 AM on a Saturday or Sunday morning.
3,Fun but a little lacking,"As we follow the exploits of a most determined reporter, The Odessa File becomes an espionage novel that quite successfully delivers a thrilling adventure amidst a Cold War European backdrop. While much of the novel is written in a tone typical of genre literature, it does contain a few interesting plot twists and an excellently descriptive portrayal of the primary antagonist during his years as and SS officer. Not a landmark piece of fiction, containing a few implausible discrepancies hidden within the plot, it does certainly entertain. For those who are fascinated by the Third Reich and the subversive exploits of the myriad of second-rate war criminals who escaped prosecution after World War II, this will be a quite enjoyable read and a fun insight into some real-world personalities."
5,Great Book,"Good Stuff, not as good as The Day of the Jackal, yet one of the greatest novels i have ever read."
4,One of the best Forsyth's ever !,"The second book by Forsyth still is one of his best. It's better written than ""DAY OF THE JACKAL"", for sure. The main character Peter Miller is very credible. The funny thing is that, with passing years, almos all Forsyth's characters seemed like robots withou personality or feelings. But in ""ODESSA FILE"", they are totally alive and kicking !"
4,Thriller!,"A great read... the 300+ pages went by in no time flat. I don't read too many novels, but this one was a great read. My only problem with the book is the blending of fact/fiction and past/present which has the effect of casting the Middle East situation in terms of the Nazi treatment of the Jews, which I think is a bit dishonest."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Investigating a war criminal secret society.A young reporter gets on the trail of a war criminal known as the Butcher of Riga, a man who was in charge of a concentration camp.Thanks to a survivor's diary, and some advice from the famous nazi hunter Simon Weisenthal he sets out to infiltrate an organisation that helps war criminals get by in safety - this organisation is what part of the title refers to.After some hard work, he discovers that what this organisation is up to is really quite a bit worse than just hiding people.3.5 out of 5"
3,solid Forsyth material,"This is a solid contribution by Frederick Forsyth, one of the best espionage/thriller writers around. Odessa is a secret organization dedicated to furthering the interests of the Nazi regime in the post-World War II era, and the book is about one German's encounters with that group. Both how that German becomes drawn into pursuing Odessa and the revelation of his motivation for doing so make this book an excellent thriller. It is not quite on par with The Day of the Jackal, but it does come awfully close."
4,A Master's Beginning,"The Odessa File was my introduction to history-based thrillers many years ago. I went back to read it again and was equally impressed. Frederick Forsyth introduces a character, Peter Miller, who leads the reader through the maze of past and present. The death of an elderly man kicks off the story, leaving clues that Miller follows all the way to the end. The Nazis are the bad guys, this time a network established at the end of WWII to help leaders escape post-war Germany to new locations. Forsyth weaves people real and fictional into this story, blurring the lines between imagination and reality in a story that keeps the reader moving. If you like your thrillers well plotted and entirely believable, start with the Odessa file."
4,a book that touches your conscience and makes you think.,"This was one of the many Forsyth books that I have read and surely it is one of his best. The book is made all the more readable by its total lack of drama and of the usual stuff that we would find in a book on this subject.He very skillfullt weaves the story and slowly leads us to the wholly unexpected climax. Only, the end could have been better."
4,"Great Book, Forsyth is a master","This was the fourth Forsyth book I have read, and although it was not as good as the Day of the Jackal, it was still one of the best I've ever read. It was interesting, and did not have excessive amounts of violence. It was well written, except for the end."
5,gripping classic mystery thriller,"A classic mystery suspense set in 1960s Germany. A journalist gets involved in hunting down a Nazi war criminal (the Butcher of Riga) who is being aided by a shadow organization called The Odessa (name an acronym, not geographical). With a plot that links to arab terrorists, Israel, and ex-SS men, it's thrilling and tightly crafted. Fantastic, and apparently based on much fact in the generals."
3,Not bad,"I found this to be merely an average session from the MJQ, who were no doubt still getting comfortable with one another in one of their first recordings. Not a bad album, but hardly an essential. Try ""Pyramid,"" ""Fontessa,"" or the 2 CD ""Dedicated to Connie"" first."
2,Poor Sound Quality,"Of all the MJQ recordings available, this would definitely not be the first choice. The sound quality is definitely lacking on this recording. You'd be better off with ""Concorde"" or ""Django"" which are both solid 4 star recordings if you're looking for early work."
1,Wrong color in the ink cartridges,"Very bad ink quality and the colors do not mach the original colorsSome color were in the wrong color cartridgesBig mistake , buying cheep is not always the solution."
5,Great learning experience,"Scott Houston explains all the fancy nuances of playing piano in a manner that's very easy to grasp. I know I should learn all the foo-foo stuff, BUT I REALLY just want to learn how to play tunes from a practical perspective, for my own satisfaction and gratification.I was skeptical to try and learn from a DVD but the way the material is organized, and the way Scott explains EVERY detail in very understandable terms, has been a great learning experience for me and has truly helped me learn how to play piano!!This is my third of his DVD's and plan to buy more. I look at it this way, for less than the cost of a local lesson, I get to learn a lot and replay my ""lesson"" over and over again!"
4,super nice watch,"BEAUTIFUL WATCH!! I GOT MINE AS A GIFT FROM MY BROTHER AND SINCE THEN IT'S CALLING EVERYBODY'S ATTENTION ALL THE TIME. AS EVERY BIG AND RESPECTABLE WRIST WATCH, IT'S A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE SOMETIMES, MUST IF YOU HAVE TO WEAR A LONG SLEEVE SHIRT.I LIKE THE BLUE LEATHER BAND WHEN IT'S NEW. AFTER DAILY USE, IT STARTS TO HAVE A ""FUNNY"" SMELL DUE TO THE SWEAT. ONE THING ON THIS NAUTICA, I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO MY CHRONOMETER (TACHYMETER) BUT WHEN I TRY TO PUT IT IN ZERO TO RECORD TIME, THE GAUGE GOES EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER THE ZERO, BUT NEVER TO THE START POSITION! NO IDEA. PERHAPS MINE ITS THE ONLY ONE WITH THIS PROBLEM.....DESPITE THESE DRAWBACKS, IT'S A VERY NICE COOL PIECE AND YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE ""WEARING"" A WATCH SO IT'S AN EXCELLENT GIFT FOR EVERYONE!"
5,"Challenging, interesting read","This work is essential reading for students of Philosophy and Religion, and important for it's implications on society and politics.I strongly recommend reading this work."
5,Works very well!,Upgraded memory on a HP Pavillion that was extremely slow. Memory upgrade has it working like a new machine!
3,Just misses the mark,"The premise is good. When Rachel Anderson was a teenager on the run from the last of several foster homes she's been in since her parents left her an orphan when she meets with Christian who whisks her off to France and a new life. There he moulds her into a thief, a thief under his control. However she takes an opportunity to escape and tries to find her own life. Using the skills he trained for as a security consultant.Then a job goes wrong and brings her back to France following a jewel. Then she finds out that she never was really independent of Christian. Who can she trust and can he master her again?Although it's an interesting premise it just didn't flow for me, I kept being jarred out of the story and my eyebrow spent a fair amount of time near my hairline as one more unbelievable thing happened. While I've given it a 3* rating it's a low three stars, readable but not great."
2,Failed to Grab me...,"I usually like these sort of stories.. Kick butt female hero confronts the world. But I confess Rachel Blu left me cold. As a heroine I just had no empathy for her. I know she was raised to be an uber-thief, have no emotions, be self-sufficient etc. But somehow all this training left me with a heroine I just didn't care about. Likewise I'm not a big fan of stories involving thievery an occupation. Perhaps if Blu had been several years into her new career and developed some humanity I could be interested in her. But, her lack of emotional development, actual age, and inexperience in human relations made her sexual encounters uninteresting and virginal.I do think Hauf's writing is technically quite good. She does a great job with description and plot... But her characters seem to be emotionless mannequins, of the James Bond variety.2 Stars."
1,Complete and Utter Dreck,"I could not finish this novel at all. It was poorly written, the characters wooden and unbelievable. One of the worst books I've ever read."
1,Tech problems,"We ordered this software twice, and each time there was a problem when we tried to enter the gas station section. Amazon was very helpful in dealing with this, however they obviously cannot solve the tech defect. Very disappointing, son loves Busytown videos."
4,Great if you can get it to work,"I understand the complaints of the previous reviewers. I could not get this program to run on the PowerMac and it also had a lot of problems when I ran it on the iMac while networked to the PowerMac. But once the iMac stood alone, I only had minor problems with this program. It is a big memory hog.It's a really super program if you can get it to run. I'd pay special attention to the system requirements before buying.There are 12 different activities which teach your child all kinds of things. It's great for pretend role play also. Pump gas, serve customers in a deli, build a house, get a ship ready for sea, etc.It's too bad this title has compatibility problems with so many systems, because it really is a beautifully done program."
2,Great Idea But Full of Programming Bugs,"My three yr old loves Richard Scarry's Busytown so it was a natural choice for him. However, he was very disapointed to find one of the games (the garage) did not work at all and several of the others have programming quirks. If the cursor isn't positioned just right the game doesn't work. My advice is to select something else or wait for another imporved version."
4,Taste isn't the only thing this snack has going for it,"I don't consider myself a raw foodist. However, when it's late at night and I want something healthy that packs flavor, nutrition, fiber, protein, and low carbs all in one package. Then these crackers are the one I turn to. In fact, I'm eating them right now as I write this review.Fair warning: Don't expect the same concentrated flavors you'd get from your favorite chips. Let's be real, these are flaxseeds and because they are flaxseeds, their hard exterior makes it difficult to hold a lot of spices. But it has enough flavor to satisfy in my opinion.These crackers will appeal to those who are already maintaining a healthy diet, or those whose palates are accustomed to ""health foods."" I'm not saying a junk food addict couldn't enjoy this snack, but it's highly unlikely.Anyway, Amazon has the best prices so far so go ahead and splurge."
5,LOVE these crackers!,"After reading Wheatbelly (from Amazon), I've finally come to terms with the need to go really low-carb and avoid grains. But what to do about the need to snack and dip occasionally? These fit the bill perfectly: spicy, crunchy, healthy and gluten-free. I just wish they were available on subscribe & save now that I know they are terrific."
2,disappointment,"Poor music that walks without aim. Good for torture. Bad on the ears.Last piece sounds like Goldsmith.If you enjoy Jerry Goldsmith's music, look elsewhere."
4,Interesting read....,I enjoyed reading this. Lighthearted and relaxing book for backyard astronomers.A quick read. Makes you want to set up your grab and go and do some observing.
4,A Great Read,"This was quite a good book. Although I'm not particularly religious, it was full of interesting facts about Christ's final hours. It was refreshing to read about Him as a ""man"" as well as the saviour. Jim Bishop gives a great insight about the deeper history of the reasons and actions regarding Christ's last day. This book brought to me a greater understanding of what I had been taught as a child in terms that I could relate to on a human level."
5,A historical and literary pleasantry,"Bishop wrote a wonderful book which considers much of what Mel Gibson's recent movie depicts. Bishop is a historian at heart, breaking in with full-length chapters on Roman and Palestinian life and history, as he considers the last hours and days of Christ's life. This is a bold text for anyone to undertake write because there exists some uncertainties when detailing with these events. One great thing about this text is that it is a simple and quick read. Not a thousand page history and doctrinal treatise. Good for all ages.Bishop makes his approach a thoughtful one and employs great writing and research to present his chronology and case. One can not read this text and get a better idea of what it was like in the last hours and days, alongside a better perspective for the times and people of this period, for Christ. It is a history book in every sense. It should be applauded and read with interest; just don't bet the farm on it."
4,A Great Read,"Thought provoking material; primarily Bible-based and unbiased. Having read the Biblical account of Christ's death and ressurection, this book gave me a 'perspective' that went beyond that account. A great read for the Christian and non-Christian alike."
4,The Day Christ Died,This book brings some thoughts to mind which may or may not be the details of this day. Bibically we can read of the death and to most people it the required knowledge of Christ and His death.
1,"Allthough interesting story, horrible recount",this book led me down the road of jesus' death and i thought it could have done a better job. it told too much detail about the backround of the story and i found it misleading and tiring.
4,Alice through the looking glass,"This is the first book I've read by Lipman, but I'll certainly read more after this.Poor Alice, she lacks social skills, confidence, tact and sleep. Educated in academics, but devoid of any female intuition, she follows the path of least resistance and enters into a relationship with the crass Ray Russo. Uncouth, a pathelogical liar and cheapskate, he is the type of character that you love to despise.Lipman's skill in the slow thaw of Alice's resistance to Ray, her development of social skills and her awakening of her potential as a physician and woman is what makes the character of Alice so believable.It is an enjoyable read, with enough depth to satisfy a discerning audience."
3,Entertaining but no payoff at the end,"This was a thoroughly enjoyable read until the very end; I kept expecting to get something more --to find out what the future husband is up to or at least more insight into him and his motives. unfortunately the answer seems to be very two-dimensional and rushed compared to the care put in to the rest of the story. btw if they ever make this into a movie, i can see sandra bullock playing the klutzy female lead."
5,I can't believe some people didn't love the heck out of this one!,"This was my first Lipman novel and I loved it. As a physician fairly recently finished with residency, I couldn't get enough of Alice's trials within the medical field. And there was not an inaccuracy in the whole thing, which is unusual when non-MD authors try to write about MDs. And the portrayal of Ray was perfect. I listened to the audio version, which was great since it was read by Lipman herself -- the tone was perfect. A really enjoyable story. Spent a lot of time in my car just to hear more."
3,Waiting for the laughs,"My book club selected this book because we wanted something funny to read. With the turn of every page I wondered if this is where the laughs would begin. They never came. Alice is a depressed character, and perhaps it's a tribute to Lipman's writing that she manages to depress the reader. There is delight to be found in the cast of supporting characters, even though more of them are despicable than likable.On a technical note about the writing style, I found it very difficult to read the conversations when only about half of the spoken dialogue is in quotes. Backing up and rereading whole paragraphs was required to discern actions from thoughts from speech.Despite the drawbacks, ""The Pursuit of Alice Thrift"" is actually a good story that draws you in. A fast read that keeps you turning pages to find out what happens next and in the end. Overall I give it three stars: I'd recommend it in paperback for beach reading this summer."
1,No redeeming value,"Dull, dry, depressing, and devoid of any point. Alice is socially akward, lonely, and inept in group settings. Naturally she wants to be a doctor. The only funny scene is her mother trying to convince her she's autistic. Laugh a minute this one..."
4,Cute and lighthearted,"This was my first Elinor Lipman book. It was cute and lighthearted. The central character, Alice Thrift, has a dry humor that I enjoyed. Yet it doesn't pull you in. I felt like an observer. The characters aren't 3-dimensional enough to bond with. However, that shouldn't stop you from reading it. It's entertaining and was an enjoyable read."
2,Dreary little book,"What a small, dreary book! The author gives away the ending in the first few pages, so there is zero suspense. The main character is a charmless victim who doesn't drive the action - just lets events unfold. And too many of the others are stereotypes. If there were any plot I could forgive the dull characters, or if there were exciting characters the dull plot, but the combination was uninspiring. Too bad, because Lipman can write, but her readers deserve better."
3,Mixed Bag,"Started reading this book and thought it was adorable - really light and fun...just when it was getting really good the story seemed to stop. What happened? I loved Inn at Lake Devine and Lipman's writing is delightful, but I was really disappointed that the last 1/3 of the book seemed to miss something."
3,Not your usual chick-lit&#65533;,"Alice Thrift, a surgical intern, is definitely not your typical ""chick lit"" heroine. She's not gorgeous; she doesn't have a close group of girlfriends to chat about men with, in fact, she's not really actively looking for a man. When Alice meets Ray Russo one day and manages to talk him out of a nose job, she never guesses he will want to start a relationship with her. Can Alice trust Ray? Does she even like him? And why would someone outgoing like Ray like someone who's basically a social misfit like her? While I admit sometimes it was difficult to read about a main character with so little self-esteem, the others around Alice kept the book from being dragged down too much in Alice's depressed moods. Not bad, not great, but different nonetheless."
4,"Breezy, Witty Fun","Joe Keenan meets Susan Issacs in this charming novel about a likable but socially inept surgical intern who meets the man of not quite her dreams. Her suitor, a middle aged fudge salesman, pursues her with hilarious vigor, but it's her reactions to her circumstances that make the story so funny. This was the first book I've read by Elinor Lipman, and if her other books are as enjoyable as this one, I'll certainly be reading them!"
2,hasn't figured out her genre,"I can't quite figure out what's wrong with Elinor Lipman's novels. Nothing has touched The Inn at Lake Devine. She's clearly an intellectual, as evidenced by her language, but her characters all sound the same. They're fairly intellectual too, with lots of clever wordlplay. But the plots are predictable and the characters all sound entirely the same. Lipman falls just short of being a truly comedic writer."
2,just okay,"I agree that inn at Lake Divine was by far Lipman's best book. The rest have been entertainments that sort of slog on with uninspired dialogue and what I think are improbable scenes that have no ring of truth in them. I did like this story a lot, but using an emotionally frozen character as the point view makes things feel stilted and it's hard to feel any empathy for Alice. I didn't really believe the ending (which I won't give away) but I could see where it was going. All in all, this is an easy, enjoyable read. Better than some of the other crap out there, but not as smart or original as Lipman's finest work."
3,Not just a pretty cover,"Don't be fooled by the shiny, cartoonish cover into thinking that this book is pure 'chick lit'. The writing is excellent, the characters are well wrought, the dialog pitch-perfect.So why only 3 stars? The book is too slow. It has plenty of opportunities for conflict but, like the main character Alice Thrift, it's too timid for its own good, it lingers over many silly scenes (stretched-out descriptions of dinners, conversations with assorted family members, etc).The protagonist - and narrator - Alice has a sure, consistent voice. I just didn't find her engaging enough to truly root for her."
3,Mediocre at best.,Alice was so boring that it sounded phony. Lipman had a little potential with this story but never expanded on any of it. Probably I won't indulge in any more Lipman stories.
4,Loved the pursuit!!!,"I had no idea it was going to be this good! It took me awhile to get sucked into this book but once I was there, there was no going back! I loved Alice, although she isn't funny, energetic, witty or anything most characters are! She is dry, full of wisdom, and without social knowledge. I loved her trying to bond etc. You will love this book!"
2,roller coaster book from interesting to absolute boredum,"As a cavalry history buff I was very interested to read this book. It took all I could do to finish this book. If you are interested in the daily orders that range from oders for deserters, forage, arrest, sickness, or as the author states daily life then you will love this. For me it was a struggle. The maps were so small that I needed a magnifying glass to read. It would have been nice to have had a Texas map showing all of the counties that the soldiers were from. Overall a history lesson of a Texas cavalry unit that suffered greatly as many did in this sad time in our history."
2,Reprint of the OR material,"This book is a simple reproduction of most of the Official Records (OR's) material regarding Parson's.It is a good source for reference material, but does not contain much original material in assessing Parsons. It is unclear if the material is complete, or just a partial collection of the records pertaining to Parsons Command."
3,"great detail, lots of natural creatures, but lacks magical/mythical creatures","This book reads more like a naturalists compendium of creatures then it does a sourcebook for a role playing game. It goes into great detail about a great number of natural creatures that are unlikely to have much use in most adventures.The sections for magical/mythical creatures is rather small and quite imcomplete. It lacks most of the common creatures found in most fantasy adventures such as orcs, trolls, goblins, etc."
5,"Great for Kids, not so much for Dogs","This gate is sturdy for the price and fits tightly and securely into the doorway. However, I actually got this gate to keep our puppy out of the litter box (ugh, gross!). Within 5 minutes of putting it up, our 8 week old (yes, weeks) lab/shep puppy was over the gate. I think the mesh enabled him to climb it. So, the gate still gets five stars since it is, afterall, for kids. I know a lot of people buy baby gate for dogs, so just wanted to give a heads up for those who are looking at this gate for this purpose."
3,Fine to leave in place,"Gate works ok if you want to leave it in place. We have it in the fireplace. Working well, but I don't want to move it!"
3,not good for wide spaces,"We bought this gate to keep our daughter out of the kitchen, rather than baby proofing the entire area. It says that it fits an opening up to 42 inches, which is what we needed. However, that is the max width and it tends to bow when you extend it that far. It works for now, as our daughter is only crawling, but I'm a bit concerned how it will do when she starts walking and running. We may end up investing in a wall mounted unit for a more secure gate."
4,Not a good fit,"There is nothing wrong with the gate itself. It did't work well for us because of the base trim, making the bottom of the doorway a different width than the middle."
3,won't accommodate moldings,"The gate is very easy to use, although has practically no instructions and I had to get my brother to show me how it works. But maybe that's just my ignorance.The main problem with this gate is that it is not adjustable top to bottom, so that if your wall has moldings it will not work unless you go above them. Granted, it will probably still work this way as few babies could figure out how to shimmy underneath, and toddlers' heads would probably not fit beneath it, but far from perfect.Also, if your walls are less than even you might encounter the same problem, so that all four of the grips would not touch and make the gate unstable."
5,Great Gate!,"I have a 8m old who just recently started crawling and we wanted to have an easy portable gate we could put up anywhere. This is it! Its very light and very easy to set up in any door way. The pressure lock system is simple and makes for a tight fit. Not sure how it would work with older babies or toddlers, but right now its great!!"
4,"Lasts forever, better than the plastic one","Cheap and works like a charm! My Mom bought one of these things back in the day for use with my brother, who is now 20 years old. (And was VERY tough on this gate.) I am STILL using this thing at her house for my son! (Who is just as tough on the gate!) It works 100 times better than my ""first years"" plastic one. Yes, the adjustable bar is kind of a pain in the butt to set; but once you set that thing, it is there for good!"
2,Easily knocked down by puppy...,"We bought this gate to keep our puppy in the kitchen while we were away, and even at five months he could easily knock it down. The gate works well as a barrier, but does not stand up to much pressure. If you are looking for a sturdier gate, you may need to spend more money..."
1,Didn't work for us,This gate would not stay put snugly in the door. We tried a few different doorways with no luck. Had to return it.
2,Not sturdy enough,"Even when fitting tightly against the doorway, this gate is not sturdy enough to keep my 11-month old son from pulling it down. He stands up and shakes it back and forth, and has many times either fallen forward or backward because the gate didn't stay put. I can only put it up for a few moments, because I don't feel like he is safe. The other thing I don't like about it is that it takes longer than I'd like to get it positioned correctly. The wood isn't entirely straight, and my door frame doesn't seem to be either, so it takes some wiggling to find a place where both the top and bottom are securely in place. For me, this is inconvenient because as soon as my son sees me putting up the gate, he zips over to it and begins shaking it to get out. This gate may work for small pets, but I would not recommend it for kids."
2,Not for dogs either,"This gate is easy for the dog to climb over. The same pressure gate with vertical bars is much more effective as long as your dog isn't small enough to squeeze through. Avoid theEvenflo G202 Position And Lock Gate - Clear Wood - White Meshor any with the ""mesh""."
1,Not the best,"This gate does serve its purpose normally but my 18 month old can pretty much get it down now. It does a number on paint. Has stripped my wall of paint in several places and also if your child gets ahold of it when it is not up, like mine did, he can put big gauges in the walls or cut himself on the metal part of the arm that locks the gate. Invest a little more money.. you will pay for buying this cheaper item."
1,No time to struggle,THIS IS THE POOREST DESIGN I HAVE EVER SEEN. I USED TO HAVE A PLASTIC GATE THAT LOCKED IN PLACE IN A FEW SECONDS. THIS ONE I STRUGGLE WITH FOR UP TO 5 MINUTES TRYING TO GET THE PANELS TO STAY IN THE TRACKS AND GET IT LOCKED IN THE RIGHT POSITION. DON'T BUY THIS ONE!! I HATE IT AND AM SEARCHING FOR A WAY TO SEND IT BACK.
2,Inexpensive but hard to use,We bought this gate to put in a standard doorway between our kitchen and home office. I liked the inexpensive cost compared to other gates and it seemed like it would be easy to use. Either we received a defective gate or the design itself is flawed. Our doorway size was such that the gate's metal locking hinge landed between two of the pre-cut grooves in the gate. Despite many efforts (including those of my engineer husband) we could not get the gate to lock at a length tight enough for the gate to stay in place. We will be returning this gate.
1,just awful,"No matter what we do, we cannot get this item to stay firm against the wall. I can get it to secure against the wall, but put the slightest pressure against it and it moves.My little ones are determined. They knocked it over with very little effort.Don't purchase this item. The low cost is a disguise for its ineptness."
1,"Can you say ""crappy?""","I'm very disappointed by this gate. I purchased it to enclose my dog in the kitchen. My current gate (Four Paws brand) is only 32"" high and my dog jumps over it. So I decided to purchase this one to place on top, thus creating a 5-foot barrier.This gate feels flimsy and doesn't fit properly, even on the same exact width setting as the Four Paws gate.I have a feeling this gate is going to break after a few uses. The price is cheap and so is the quality. I should've bought another one by Four Paws for a few dollars more."
4,Gate is short for my purpose but otherwise fine,"It would have been nice to have a height dimension right in the description. I bought two of these from Amazon to keep my growing kitten out of my office. I need to control two doorways and I stack my other two gates one atop the other to keep her out. These new ones are just over 23"" tall, compared to my others at about 32"" each, so I now have to order another one to do the trick. Other than that, they're fine I hope the diamond pattern material will discourage/prevent her from climbing it."
3,ok gate just not for us,"We bought this at Wal Mart for $10. The gate works well enough for the money, if your child doesn't try to conquer it... my 1 year old however has no problems knocking it down if he wants to get through.. also you can't custom fit it, it comes with little notches you gotta fit a bolt into and it's either to wide or to narrow for our door frame so it takes some finesse to get it to stay put in the first place... I wouldn't buy it again especially not for $20..."
4,Affordable and Decent Quality,I didn't have much money right when my son learned to crawl and this was the BEST affordable safety gate I could find that was wooden & with length extension so I could use in different places in my home. So far it was a great investment of $20! : )
3,baby gate,"It does what I wanted, keeps dog & cat apart. However, I had been using a neighbor's gate by the same maker & the older one is sturdier, better made."
2,Works - $10 at Wal-Mart,"This gate holds up fairly well. Not difficult to use and pretty sturdy. Although, you can buy these at Wal-Mart for $10!"
1,It didn't work for us.,"I bought this gate at Wal-Mart in order to block off a hallway to prevent my 14 month old son from getting himself into misadventures. The gate was exactly the wrong size for my hallway. I did get it into place and locked, but I could tap it over with a slight shove. It would have been no match for my baby. I could not exert enough force to get the gate into the next locking position--perhaps if I had walls made of rubber. This gate can serve as a decorative barrier for a family with a minimalist aesthetic sense, but if you are like me and are trying to find a gate in order to protect the safety of your child, look elsewhere. I am going to take the gate back to Wal-Mart in the morning."
4,easy and affordable,"this is the most affordable and easiest gate to use. i have one at my kitchen entrance, bottom of the stairs, and one at the top of the stairs. the only thing i don't enjoy is that everyone must step over it, but it does its job at a good price."
3,flimsy,good: tall enough kids can't climb over. bad: very flimsy. Not at all sturdy like the old one I had for years. I don't expect this one to last very long.
4,Does what it is supposed to do.,"It does what it is supposed to do. We use it to keep the dogs separated from the cat food & litterbox. It did come apart once & was hard to get reassembled. I would like it better if it were put together with screws rather than brads, but overall a good gate."
2,Not That Sturdy,I purchased this gate a few years ago for my new 3wk old pug and she knocked it over amediately. Now that I have a son I might use it when he firsts starts to crawl but only long enough to find a good one because I know as soon as he starts trying to pull himself up it will not stay.
1,flimsy and short gate,We got this gate to lock our 25 pound puppy in the kitchen. It's very flimsy and hard to lock into place. Our puppy can easily jump over it.
1,Pass on this gate,"This gate *might* be okay if all you're penning in is a 3lb lapdog and you plan on not taking it down. However, my poor little DS of 14 months knocked this thing down within an hour of my properly putting it up and banged his head. Thanks Evenflo. So I scrapped it and ordered a First Years Hands Free metal gate with a foot pedal - which also requires no drilling into the wall and is available on Amazon. This gate is strong and fantastic! So my advice is pass on this Evenflo gate and spend a little extra to buy yourself peace of mind and safety for your child."
3,I was looking for an extra tall gate,"When I searched Amazon, I was looking for an extra tall gate. Unfortunately I presumed that what showed up in my search was what I was searching for, but when this gate arrived, it doesn't seem any taller than the average gate. I am disappointed because what I need is an extra tall gate not a regular sized gate. I will have to eat the $20 because Amazon will say it was my mistake and not their search feature's fault. It's too bad that when you search, things come up that are not at all what you're looking for. You'd think I'd learn....Very disappointed."
2,Not What I Needed,The gate was neede for upstairs and the instruction ststed that it is not recommended for that therfore defeating my purpose.Not What I Needed
4,LIGHT WEIGHT/GOOD GATE,I like this gate because it's so light weight and easy to transport from one location to the next. This gate fits most door ways easily.
3,Sorta flimsy,"I bought this in an attempt to keep my new puppy away from my cats. It works in that regard, but even the pup can push on it hard enough to knock it down."
5,Wonderful gate!,"I had a gate similar to this one, it last for 3 years, it would have last longer if my heavy handed husband wouldnt have broke it. I just ordered another one Monday and it came right on time today. Its in perfect condition and its great for my toddler who gets into everything! Hopefully this gate will last more than 3 years."
2,safety gate customer,I was not very happy with the gates. They were not long enough for my stairs and are hard to position so that the gates stay in position. We had bought another type of Evenflo pressure gates at Walmart and had been happy with them. These did not hold up the same.
3,A little rickety,"This product works, but boy, you have to be careful handling it. If you pick it up the wrong way, it'll fall apart and you have to put it back together. The fasteners on the frames are inset screws, but I couldn't get them tightened up enough so they wouldn't wiggle apart. I use it to keep my 2lb bunny in his room, but I wouldn't trust it for a toddler or even a small dog."
2,good while it lasted,when i got this gate i thought it was great. fast shipping and looks great. ive had it for a few weeks and the stick in the middle already cracked so i have to find another gate. wont be buying from this seller again.
3,"Good Gate, but Not for my son","We chose this gate based on its price and ease of use. My in-laws had one for their other grandchildren. It fits well in our doorway and seems very secure. I can release it easily, or step over it if necessary. I also liked the fact that it required no hardware mounting into the wall or doorway, since I live in an apartment with a picky landlord. However, my son (10months, with 8 teeth) likes to chew on EVERYTHING, including this gate. ... I think this one would work for him quite well once he gets out of the chewing stage. He has also bitten off a few small pieces of wood which makes me nervous. This is a good gate for those whose children don't gnaw on everything in sight."
4,Security Gate,"I really like this product. Its lightweight and takes seconds to install. At this price, I bought several to keep in different parts of the house and also in my car for travel."
5,Highly Recommended!!,"When installed properly, this gate is extremely sturdy. Our 14-month old son often pulls up on it and it doesn't budge. Furthermore, because this gate is portable, it has been very helpful in a variety of situations.I have used this gate to keep my son from trekking onto a wet kitchen or bathroom floor. With practice, it installs in seconds. And instead of closing the door to the office, where there are wires galore, we use this gate. By using this gate (as opposed to closing doors) we have been able to more safely take care of practical tasks, while at the same time, maintain some contact with our son and the rest of the apartment.The price is reasonable and the quality is excellent. We highly recommend this gate!"
2,Don't waste your money,I bought this gate to keep my 9 mos old in the nursery for when I have to do little errands around the house. The way the notches are on the gate makes it nearly impossible to get a tight fit on our doorway. I have an older house so the doorway may not be standard. I have purchased another gate the evenflow crosstown soft portable travel gate to see if that will be any better.
2,Breaks easily,"These gates are the bane of my existence and do not work well for pet gates. The latch bits break all the time. Spend more, buy a plastic one."
2,Poor quality puppy gate,"I brought this gate to keep my then 16 week old chihuahua in certain areas with me. When he got to approx 4.5lbs he jumped at it, knocked on it down and rode it down a flight stairs! He was not hurt, but this is a baby gate, what would happen if a baby leaned up agaist it. I still use it because he knows it means ""stay in here"" but if he wants to he can knock it down! I don't recomend this for child nor dog"
2,May be a cheap solution- but broke,"Within 3 weeks, this thing broke. I can't figure out how to get the screws / latch back in the right way to make it slide or permanently stay in place. It's lost it's tension. I use it for a rabbit, but wouldn't recommend it for a kid."
5,This is so beautiful finished!,My daughter-in-law did this kit. It looks so beautiful that I am trying to find one myself to make.
3,broadway music,"While the scores are good, some of the singers are lacking. Songs that I was hopoing would have a female voice were actually male and quite flat and not particularly good singers. Didn't find it helpful as a soprano when had to listen to a baritone or tenor!"
2,Bring a Book!...oh....wait a minute....you already did,"Fans of Blondie and Debbie Harry will no doubt enjoy this book, although it doesn't probe very deeply or reveal many new facets to the Blondie story. Cathay Che's literary voice is a bit too gaga for its subject for my taste. She oversells it a bit in other words, which makes it feel like fan magazine stuff and not really a biography for adults. Still, it's Debbie and Blondie, so even a poorly written book is better than none! Sadly however, the photo sections are very skimpy for a band whose appeal was so visual. What the market really needs now is something along the lines of ""Bowie: An Illustrated Record"", a coffee table book on Blondie that is mostly images by different photographers. Are you listening, Taschen?"
4,Why can't I find this tea in the local grocery stores,I tasted the yellow label tea while traveling in Europe and found it much more robust than the regular Lipton tea. I don't understand why I can't find it in the local grocery stores.
5,Drink every day,I first had this tea on my trip to the Philipines but could not find it at my stores in Houston. I was pleased to find it on Amazon for about what's would pay for regular Lipton tea at the store. The tea is strong and flavorful with very little tannin taste as LNG as you remove the bag after it reaches the desired dark red color.
4,This book is high quality!,"I purchased this book last week and was happy to see the quality of material covered within the book. Basically, it covers the fundamentals of web services and does a good job explaining SOAP. The security chapter in this book is long.I like this book and would recommend it to others. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I liked another book Java Web Services Architecture a little better. This book is good and worth the money."
1,Repetitve and shallow content,"This book is too repetitive and verbose. Pretty much everything is repeated over and over again. When you repeat something over and over again, it becomes painful to read and comprehend. Repetition also increases the number of pages. May be the publishers feel they are providing value to readers by giving them a thick fat repetitive book? When you repeat something repeatedly, you lose the gist of what the person is trying to convey. Repetition makes the discussion verbose. I don't particularly find verbosity and redundancy as positive qualities of a book. The authors also have not scoped the topics to cover well. They are all over the place trying to touch upon in little depth a wide range of topics. That allows them to repeat themselves even more.Or you could have just read the title of my review. ;-)"
2,Bored to tears...,"I am new to web services, and purchased this book based on the good reviews it has received. I was quite disappointed in this book, which is both repetitive, drawn-out and shallow in its coverage of web services. Although the book covers most aspects of web service development using JWSDP, as a result almost nothing is covered in great detail, and the book's 700+ pages ultimately provide a dreary drawn-out overview of web services better found elsewhere.I am now using Apache Axis to create web services, trying to figure out how to create stateful web services. Axis is barely covered by the book, and I cannot find any mention of how to implement stateful web services. As a result, the book stays on the shelf collecting dust, while I google around the Internet for answers."
1,Don't buy this book!,"The other reviews saying ""Repetitve and shallow content"" are all 100% true.It repeats itself over and over again. Is not only boring but it's also extremely hard to follow.I'm an experienced java/jsp developer trying to get into web services, and this book only gave me frustration and disapointment.When I started reading this book I thought that WS technologies were very complex and hard to understand. Then I realized the only thing hard to understand is this book.I'm taking this book back to the store."
2,Basic Tutorial Aggregation,"I'm really disappointed with the book written by the Sun ""Architects"". I expect them to show much better expertise on web services, even I admit this may not be the book's intension.1. The book is like an aggregation of tutorials on basic stuff of each topic. There is no technical depth and you are far from building practical web services after looking at their examples.2. The concepts are not well explained. Easy topics are repeated while important topics are ignored. It's hard to learn something you don't already know.3. The book is not well reviewed. There are numerous technical errors and typos.The book does have a good scope, and can be a convenience of browsing the field, as it puts the related topics under one roof."
1,Waste of time and money,"I bought this, hoping to be able to use it on a web services project I'm doing.I find it's completely out of date. Both Sun's JWSDP and Apache Axis have moved on since this was written, and you'll get better information from their websites than you'll get from this book.Don't bother with it."
1,Not worth a buck,"Better read the specifications than this book. It is merely a compilation. No attempt has been made to illustrate a single concept. Some times, I wonder whether the authors understood something at all or just wrote the book out of passion to write a book, since there is NO value addition to your understanding. Not worth even a buck.(...)"
5,Java Developer's companion for Web services,"A great read, cover-to-cover, discussing with depth and well-explained examples outlining every why, what, and how to build Web services applications using Java. It is truly a Java developer's companion and a rare gem of a geekly book that is very helpful for a developer who wants to learn the features and complexities of building Web services practicing examples - from the beginning to the advanced.The authors did an excellent job demonstrating a complete Web services case study, Interoperability with Microsoft .NET, Web services security at just the right places to help clarify difficult topics. They used a variety of software including Sun JWSDP, Weblogic, Apache Axis, IBM WSDK, Systinet and Microsoft .NET for the demonstrating examples with build scripts and instructions. Which is quite rare to find in other Web services books.If you are going to build Web services in your project, then it is a true companion and must have book -- I can assure you."
3,"Indeed, the tress said very litte","My excpectations for this book may have been a little too high. Merton's work pepper my shelves, put this one I think will go up for resale. Other than a precious few noteable quotes, it read more like a nature walk than a spiritual path for enlightenment. Ah well, compilations of the works of others can be a very tricky business. Nice try though Ms. Deignan."
1,Nice try environmentalists.....,"I just love when people take a dead man's writings totally out of context and then use him for their agenda. Anyone who has really read Thomas Merton's works (not edited works) knows the man loved God alone and did not worship nature. Nice try, but you can only fool people who don't understand your agenda. Anyone who really wants to know what Thomas Merton believed should read ""Seeds of Contemplation."""
5,Focusing on the nature that gave us to the world.,"Merton has helped me to open all my senses to a world that has been talking to us from the beginning,The Spell of the Sensuous: Perception and Language in a More-Than-Human Worldand now I can begin to hear it and wonder at its messages, the messages that David Abram also talks about in his The Spell of the Sensuous.(I tried to insert a product link to the Abram book, but it doesn't show up when I preview this review)"
4,Heart warming!,"What a miraculous life Suzanne Somers has led. Before reading ""Keeping Secrets"", I tended to view her as a shallow and superficial Hollywood blond. This book has given me insight into her painful past, and I now feel a great deal of respect for her. Her story is painful at the beginning; she vividly describes her miserable home life with an alcoholic father. Sommers' narrative contains no trace of self-pity or exaggeration. She tells the unfortunate details of her father's alcholism in a stark, honest fashion. As she grows into adulthood, we see her flounder at first, and then gradually make the incredible journey into self-discovery and healing. At the same time, her career begins to take off. I was so pleased to read about her triumphs and successes - I can't think of a more deserving person. This story is truly inspirational."
4,Even if you're not her fan...,"I recomend this book, it makes you understand how disfunctional a family can be and how it'll affect every single member of the family almost forever, how to deal with a situation like that and find a way to create a balance in your life, even with a harsh past."
4,Glorious Afro Pop,"In their third release, Hijas del Sol (an aunt and a nephew from Equatorial Guinea living in Spain, singing both in Spanish and in their native language called Bubi) have made some wonderful Afro-pop. Released in 2000, the whole album is wonderful, but if you have to name some songs I would name ""Alale"", ""Sibollo"", ""El Viajero"" and ""M30"". In 2001, Hijas del Sol made an even better album, ""Pasaporte Mundial"". Unfortunately, they have remained pretty obscure (a change of record label did not help them in achieving a larger popularity). Their 2003 ""Colores del Amor"" is almost impossible to get outside of Spain, and is unavailable right now in Amazon (as most of their records)."
1,Pathetic,"Everyone must go to the web site to see how funny this is. These guys actually think they were some sort of major influince to Queensryche, Soundgarden and Pearl Jam. Geeze, they won a dumb MTV contest 20 years ago. Get over it. I thought Kevin Dubrow was as pathetic as it could get, but if you actually remeber these guys, this tops it all. At the web site, you won't find any recent pictures. In most of the pictures, the singer is wearing those stupid white boots still. I haven't actually heard the CD and that, of course, will anger the few listeners of this stuff: probably friends of the band anyway. I can't believe anyone would take the time to put the web site together. I can't believe that the members of the band would be so out of it to actually think that anyone in the world cares."
4,Cheatin women are universal,Te Recomiendo Esa Ingrata (track 1) conveys the feelings of a betrayed love. Chach was ahead of his time.
4,"Got it ""used"" worth the money",Someone had ordered this and returned. I saved about $30 and I am all about savings. It works great and really reduces the glare. Kind of wished I got Dark Grey instead of Black because my interior is Grey but it works just great.
1,Description says '12-pack' but they shipped just one.,"The description clearly states '12-pack', there is even an Amazon smiley face saying '12-pack' in the image.So I expect 12 bits but I received a single bit."
2,hammock camping-light on revalations,After finishing Hammock Camping my advice is as follows. Go and check out Ed Speer's website and read all what is there and save your money. All the info that is in the book that is worth anything is posted on the site. A good book for those just staring out.
5,good to know,Nice little guide by a expert who gives hands on advice. comprehensive and affirming to camp in the outback with a hammock.Detailed description make it to an handbook I wouln't like to miss on my bookshelf
2,Decent book,The only thing not realized is that even though this book is good for beginners I realized that there are so many better resources on the internet from multiple post and blogs about others have done Inge to make it better and more comfortable.
2,Dark in Parts,"I ordered this book for my 6 year old grand daughter. Though it is a wonderful story, I personally felt that the discussion of hanging the blacks was too dark for the child's book and I returned it. I read the book and felt unfortable giving it, so I had my husband read it, he agreed. Though the truth of the history of the blacks cannot be hid, it really was not needed in this story of friendship."
2,A Disturbing Line,"Well, the book was a bit boring in my opinion. Also, the line about the hanging Black men is much too disturbing and controversial for children."
4,Compatible as Promised,Had the original OEM cartridge and replaced it with this one. It works just as promised with a clairity as good as the original cartridge.
3,Dark Fluff,"This is delightful, summertime fluff. The characters are interesting, the bad guys are creepy and the history (Catherine de Medici and St. Bartholomew's Eve) is real. The fantasy the author spins around the events leading up to the slaughter is an enchantment in itself. Only the language itself falls short of the story. The dialogue is sometimes stilted and the sporadic use of French feels forced. All in all the book is a good bet for a pool side read."
4,"good story, good characters, great advice","The Dark Queen is an interesting story set in a historical setting with a feminist slant. It's much more than just a romance novel with some historical details thrown in. The main character is coping with the recent loss of her mother and the changing relationships with her younger sisters. Roles of women are examined and questioned is a very modern sense though the story is set in 16th century France. Having said all this, I enjoyed The Dark Queen (though she doesn't appear until the 2nd half of the book) and despite the 500 pages the story kept my attention.I liked the little touches--the heroine is not irritatingly beautiful, the first ever head butt between lovers and this bit of advice for women everywhere: Never trust a man over your cat."
2,Just okay,"After Carroll's Bridefinder series, this particular offering falls flat. Ms. Carroll is undoubtedly a decent writer, but I found this book to be little more than cardboard characters moving through the paces of a romance novel. The plot was trite. The characters were juvenile. I love, love, loved the bridefinder series. In that particular series, the situations were always fraught with organic tension and humor. If you want to see what Ms. Carroll can really do, buy that series instead."
3,Good Pageturner,"I sped through this novel, barely able to put it down, but by the end I was a little sick of it. I was hoping it would be more. . . historical. Or atleast somewhat believable. Instead it is a fantasy tale of witches and magic rings and potions. The romantic side was enjoyable and the characters were very likeable. But why do they all stutter???!!!"
3,Sadly mistaken,"Initially I was excited to read an author who (according to other reviews) weaves history in with her plotline; however, although the writing style is ""okay"", Carroll succeeds only in boring me. Her plot is dull, characters trite, and attempt at history frankly stupid."
4,The Dark Queen,"Wow. When i first got this book i thought it was going to resemble Philippa Gregory's 16th century English Historical books, only in France instead of England. I couldnt have been more wrong! But i am not dissapointed! This novel is more a romance novel than a Historical fiction, although it does teach you a few things here and there. And it actually didnt have much to do with The Dark Queen, as its title suggests. I loved this book. The entire thing! I could hardly put it down. I would deffinitely recomend this book. The love story tugs at your heart and puts a smile on your face!"
4,Silly wabbits - this is for kids,"Okay, so everything doesn't rhyme in here - unlike its predecessor ""5 Little Monkeys Jumping on the Bed"". Once I got over that, I did enjoy the sweet, soft pastel illustrations. The bunnies are adorable, filled with detail that children delight in noticing. Kids also have a fascination with ""boo-boos"" and plenty of things happen to these rambunctious cuties. Every time momma calls the doctor, he (or she - we are in the 21st century now) gives the same answer, which kids love to shout out with glee. They don't care that it doesn't rhyme. Oh, to be innocent again."
1,Does not fit.,Ordered this replacement mirror for my 2000 VW Passat. It does not fit at all. I returned it stating the problem at was simply sent the exact same mirror which does not fit. Utterly useless.
4,pillow are nice ..once again wrong color,i could have sworn i clicked on the black ..but mine came in moss green .. thankfully they are dark enough to be mistaken for black ... otherwise they are very nice pillows comfy i needed something soft for the couch that did not look too tacky or too stiff .. these work great
3,good,"in general, i like the pillows. although, the picture of the color made me think they would be a deeper grayish blue and they turned out to be more navy."
5,Very nice pillows!,I just received these pillows in gold and was pleasantly surprised how nice they are. I have been searching for gold pillows and glad I found these. I was so happy with them I ordered 2 more in the Mulberry (which looks more burgundy)to go with the gold ones. They look very nice on my sofa.
4,Brentwood Chenille Fringe Pillow in Linen,I purchased 3 in the Linen color. They are really very nice.And it appears they will hold up well. If I could find theright color match for my needs I would buy a few more.
3,Not what I expected,"These pillows are the perfect color to match my new sectional, but I was a little disappointed when I receieved them. The quality did not meet my expectations... it's seemed more like a chenille mix, not 100% chenille. Typically, 100% chenille pillow are extremely soft, and that was not the case with these pillows."
2,The gold is ugly,"The color pictured is a soft gold. The pillows are a very dark, brassy gold. Ugly color. Also, there's a harsh chemical smell."
5,This book is the classical book about Philippines.,This book is the classical book about Philippines. It published in 1904 right after the war between U.S. and Philippino.
3,Works like it should,This gauze is like most any other gauze. It's a lot cheaper ordering it on here though than buying it at a local pharmacy.
3,For completists,"This album sounds good, and is really live. The set is ok. It's not a very long show, and two of the songs are unreleased LC songs, and the Bad Brains cover ""Sailin' On."" It's nice to have live versions of some of the Time's Up songs, but the studio versions are better."
1,Defective map,"Do NOT buy this map. One of the major monuments is facing in the wrong direction, the Vittorio Emmanuele (aka Birthday Cake) monument. Really awful because it's a central point of the map and the city. Do not buy this map. If you go to NG's website, THEY don't even have it listed anymore! If you ever pick this one up in a store (ANOTHER reason why we need real bricks and mortar bookstores!), the monument should be facing AWAY from the Colloseum, not facing towards it. Given it's no longer on NG's website, perhaps they'll be fixing it and reissuing it. What a huge mistake!"
3,A collector must have,"As a collector of Dali prints, this is an important book to reference. However, there are numerous mistakes. Make sure that you get a copy of the erata sheet for the corrections."
1,horrible,"cheap quality, small, and ruined my new car seat when I tried to put it on, very upset about that...don't recommend buying"
5,Really nice.,These are nicer than I had expected. Pretty materials and nicely made. Not too heavy but they are substantial. Very happy with them.
5,For Baby or to Baby your skin,"To soothe and protect a baby's skin, there are few products like this one. When you want to baby your cuticles and feet, there is also nothing like this product.The scent is wonderful and you can also use this cream on chapped hands or patches of dry skin. Works especially well on elbows.~The Rebecca Review"
2,Doctor Said It Isn't Safe,"While odds are in your favor, using this (like bumper pads) could increase the risk of SIDS. But despite the warning from the doctor, I'm giving it a low rating because I found it to be unnecessary. I have twins, they did share a crib, they stayed on their sides through at least four months. Then, when they start rolling around into each other it was time to get a second crib anyway. (Doctors and experts suggest separating twins at about four to five months. So, as a crib divider, this item was useless. I did use it as a prop to help support them in a sitting position for pictures, but I don't think it was worth the money I spent."
5,Helps baby adjust,I love this product. After I brought baby home he had trouble staying asleep in his crib because it was so big. Once we made the space smaller he sleeps without a problem. Would recommend this product.
3,Not useful for long,This item seemed ideal for my twins sharing a crib. I wasn't able to use it with them for very long as it made one crib to small for two growing babies. Overall the product is well made and stayed in place. It wasn't worth the money for the short amount of time I was able to use it.
4,Hope and Humor,"Reading this book it is hard to feel too glum although breast cancer is it's subject. For women who have been through some of what the author has experienced, whether the medical ups and downs or the personal struggle with faith and hope, this book provides empathy and sustenance. With humor, intelligence and relevant information, Ms. Baker gives women a peek into the experiences so many of us will go through and survive, perhaps even thrive. You just have to read her tale of what she heard while waiting for surgery! One of those things we all can laugh at only after the fact; to be able to laugh, love, and believe is the theme of this great little book."
1,doctor lingo,"Get this book only if you can understand the doctor language because that is pretty much all it is. It only explains the chemical process in your brain, etc. instead of how to deal."
4,BLACK REEBOK,IT IS COMFORTABLE AND BLACK. IT IS OKAY. I WILL NOT SAY I AM IN LOVE WITH IT. I HAVE NOT OWNED A PAIR OF SNEAKERS IN OVER A DECADE AND I FEEL AS THOUGH I HAVE NOT MISSED OUT ON ANYTHING. NOT THRILLED AT ALL
5,MY FAVORITE ONE,"THIS SNEAKERS ARE THE BEST OF THE BEST,SO COMFY, NEVER GO OUT OF STYLE AND YOU CAN WEAR THEM WITH ALMOST EVERYTHING.YOU REALLY GOT WHAT'S SHOWN ON TH PIC.ALSO GOT THEM ON TIME AND IN EXCELLENT CONDITION."
5,AWESOME!,"Have worn this style/brand for years and was pleased at the decent price. i will continue purchasing them as my feet are narrow, flat, and i have LONG toes. These are the most comfortable walking shoes ever and REEBOK is the best!"
3,shoes are for narrow feet,"shoes were Well made, pretty but fit tightly for an 8.5.they were for narrow feet..I would like to see a wide size available."
1,Shoes,Have worn these shoes for year. Am only sorry that they don't come in wide and are no longer in stores.
2,Sometimes Groups just don't gel,"Mulligan was famous for experimenting with various sound combinations, and like Coltrane, was always looking for the ""next best perfect sound."" While interesting in spots, this session clearly was not it.These compositions are flat, angular, academic, soulless and even obtuse at times. The group never quite got around to meeting each other.This cut, made it clear that it was time for Gerry to go back to the drawing board as he eventually did after this recording session. As an inspired Mulligan fan (see earlier reviews), I can say without a doubt, that there is nothing here I can recommend. Two stars"
5,Great,this is a chill and understated work by dave douglas i enjoyed it quite a lot highly recommended
4,"Impressive chops, but what about the music ?","A few notes on this CD (which left me rather puzzled).- At first listen : outstanding mastery (especially rhythm section). Impressive display of musicianship. Very tight and dynamic.- However, the disc fails to thrill. Somewhat formulaic, resembling an academic exercise. I hate to admit it (being a great Douglas fan), but i have to force myself to listen to this one.- A record which probably aims to appeal to a wider audience, but lacks the invention and sense of adventure of previous works (such as ""Songs for wandering souls"", ""Charms of the night sky"" or ""Witness"").- Rooted in formulas from the sixties (as noted by other reviewers); Douglas seems to loose his own voice on this one.- The bottom line : when I first heard ""Kind of blue"", I was more impressed by the music than by the chops...Still, 4 stars, because I believe Douglas is one of the few real greats today. I guess I probably missed something here..."
1,sell-out?,"i am sorry to hear and see the jazz musician whose work i have most enjoyed over the last 6 years (i have some 10 dave douglas cds) has gone on to make an album that seems in all sense hopelessly inferior to anything that he has done before.starting with the artwork. i always admired dave douglas albums for the lovely poetic, dark and underground artwork that accompanied them. the artwork on this album seems just some cheapo, photo-shop manipulated thing with no deeper meaning to it whatsoever.judging from the artwork, i already feared the worst for the music. and indeed, the music is slick and commercial and fails to achieve the beautiful, dark, sensitive atmosphere that usually characterize douglas' work.it's hard to not think that signing up to a big label has had anything to do with it. has douglas sold out?"
5,What a classic,"I have worn Obsession for years and this is in my top 10 rank .I'm a strange one when it comes to scents I feel like some are made for out on the town and nothing else .The great part about Obsession you can wear it to bed ,work or even a teacher's meeting and not be overly smelly !Not to mention my husband is absolutely wild about this one ."
4,An artistic collection of musings structured only by the geography of the river,"The book is a dense collection of thoughts, experiences, reflections and recollections, which begin at the source of the Danube and end at the terminus with the Black Sea. I picked up this book for a trip in the eastern European region, with many stops along the Danube. While the book is packed with a wide array of historical, literary and artistic references, I found the exposure to new ideas refreshing, even if they disrupt the flow of the book at times. The translation from the artistic Italian prose to English seems to create unnecessarily dense wording at times, but the comprehensive collage of imagery made the book worthwhile in the end. To me, I found the style of writing like the flow of the massive Danube: sometimes it slowly swirls reflectively, but it constantly moves onwards..."
2,Not consistently a travelogue,I bought the book to prepare for a river cruise down the Danube. I expected more of a connection between locations and stories.Too many of the stories are stream-of-conscousness.
2,"Okay, but not well made.","Our cat loves chasing the mouse, however the pole is incredibly flimsy. We detached the string from the pole and tied it to the pole of another toy that the cat had officially ""killed."" He still loves it. However the metal ball inside the bell has come out so it no longer jingles and that was half the fun! All in all, I wouldn't buy this again."
3,Not like the old one...,"Photo is not what I got. Photo shows the ball of rabbit fur w/3 feathers. What I received is a cluster of 4 thinner, 'whippier' feathers with a brown plastic cap over their ends, and a bell tied onto the string about 2"" further on. NOT as shown. Problem is, of course, that our cat is addicted to the ""blue bunny"" variety, with the ball of rabbit fur. This just isn't the same to our cat. (Nor to the human caretakers.)Can't really speak to the toy's actual effectiveness; it is a very generic interpretation of: ""Mini Teaser Wand"". I do fear that the rabbit-fur one is discontinued."
4,"Informative, Scholarly Book","A book written by a man who has become very well aquainted with the subject matter. He allows the facts to present the subject with little fanfare or extra fluff. The bad is presented along with the good, and with praise when praise is warranted, and with no apologies when other authors have made excuses. All within the context of the times."
4,"Very powerful, personal view of the German Occupation","This memoir is a very heartfelt testiment to love, longing, hunger, suspicion, pain and regret. It is always a treat when a writer of Duras' caliber is witness to extraordinary events and the reader is pulled along as she desperately tries to find out information about her imprisoned husband. The fact that the episodes are presented out of order is slightly disconcerting I felt in the sense that the book becomes a collection of several periods rather than a linear narrative."
5,EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If you are tried of smooth jazz, purchase this cd. The musically arrangements are tight. They have the 70's breakdowns that are unbelievable. It is amazing to me how these boys get no airplay. You will enjoy listening to this music."
5,Gotta have Gadget,"I love this gadget. I bought two extra bases for my infant car seat for both my husband's and my mother's car. Unlike my car, there center seat has a harness strap. Those are hard to get really tight. My center seat has just the lap belt and it was easy to secure the base. With the harness strap it was just too hard to get the seat in tight enough. With the mighty tight, it was a snap. You just hooked it in, cranked it, and voula!!!That seat isn't going anywhere. I love it. It is easy to use, it makes the seat secure, and it is sturdy. You must have this if you are trying to secure a seat in a position with a shoulder harness."
1,A CAR SEAT SAFETY TECHNICIAN ON LONG ISLAND,"THIS PODUCT IS DANGEROUS!!! THIS HAS NOT BEEN CRASH TESTED AND CAN OVER TIGHTEN YOUR SEAT BELT!!! IF YOU ARE HAVING A PROBLEM GETTING YOUR CAR SEAT IN YOUR CAR SECURELY BRING YOUR CAR TO A CAR SEAT INSPECTION STATION.. CHECK WITH YOUR LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENT FIRE DEPARTMENT OR [local store] FOR INSPECTION STATIONS NEAR YOU. I CANNOT ENFORCE THIS ENOUGH DO NOT USE THIS OR ANY OTHER AFTER MARKET PRODUCT!!! IF IT CAME WITH YOUR CAR SEAT WHEN IT CAME OUT OF THE BOX ITS SAFE, IF NOT DONT USE IT!!!! GO TO [URL] FOR MORE INFO. PS I COULDNT GIVE IT ZERO STARS OR I WOULD HAVE"
1,Don't get this,"Something like this is a great idea, but when I called to ask the fire dept. to inspect my car. They said not to add any after-market things to car seats or seat belts. The firefighter said this could weaken the seat belt over time and it may break in a crash. They also said that the headrest for the infant seat was dangerous because it adds more room between baby and the seat, which may cause the baby to be injury seriously in an accident.I took both out of my car. The mighty tite is just collecting dust. I have no plans of using it or giving it away. If I can't find a use for it, I'll probably throw it away. The headrest is in the bouncer or the swing. They are great for around-the-house everyday use."
1,THESE ARE UNSAFE AND NOT RECOMMENDED BY SAFETY EXPERTS,"I had my car seat with the Mighty Tite inspeccted by the national SAFE KIDS campaign. They said i HAD to remove the Mighty Tite. The inspector said, ""They interfere with the way the seat fits and can BREAK your seat belt in the event of an accident."" The only thing they did is remove the Mighty Tite. It is unconscionable that they make this product and that stores sell it. It says on the box that it adheres to Federal regulations - there are NO federal regulations for this type of product. RETURN THIS ASAP!"
2,CHP said don't use,"I got this because so many people suggested that I should. Then I went to the CHP to get my car seat installation checked out. They said Don't use it. The manufacturers have to check out their car seats thru all kinds of crash tests, and they don't test with other products like this. Just with your seat belt. So all this does is introduce another thing that could go wrong and hasn't been tested when you most need it to go right. If you are concerned about your car seat, get the CHP to check it out - it's free! Go to http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/ and on the left is Child Seat Inspections and it will give you way to find an inspector close to you, since not everyone lives in California. :-)"
1,NOT a safe product,"Parents, please think twice before you buy this product! Ask any carseat technician, and they will tell you it is an untested product that could fail at any moment. If it happens to fail during a crash, it would be like you had not even buckled the seat in. It really isn't that hard to get a tight fit without this product. If for some reason you cannot, then take your seat to a carseat checkup- it could be you need a locking clip, which the Mighty-Tite does NOT replace, or your seat may be incompatible with your car (yes, it does happen!) I had one in my car that ruined my seatbelts. Had I not had my seat checked and been in a crash, my daughters seat would have come flying out of the car. Don't make the same mistake."
5,A W S O M E ! ! !,Well worth the money!! I almost didnt buy- thinking gosh thats kinda expensive but then I then I felt bad because it my kids life we are talking about!! Easy to install and in an instant- the carseat DOES NOT BUDGE!! Before I installed it moved way to much for my comfort!! We are now going back to buy another for our sone carseat!!!!
4,Makes my life easier!!!,"I love the Mighty Tite. I know there is controversy on the matter of using this product, but I have used it for a year with NO problems. I got it as a baby shower gift AFTER I spent well over an hour in my small british rover with my huge pregnant belly trying to get my carseat base installed tight enough. With Might Tite I have a good secure carseat in a minute! SO EASY! It is a little bulky, but it really does make the seat stay in place. My friend acutally went and got one after seeing mine!"
5,wonderful product,A family member gave me my first mighty tite when I was pregnant with my first child and I instantly fell in love. I've tried to install various carseats in various cars and I'm rarely pleased with how secure the carseat actually is. Mighty tite takes a lot of the strain out of making a carseat secure. I actually just bought 2 more for Grandma's car!
5,A must have for all Mothers.,"I have a 2002 Nissan Pathfinder and purchased the Britax Advantage infant to toddler carseat. Unfortunately, my truck was manufactured a few months to early for the LACTH system, so no matter how hard I tried I could not tighten the seatbelt enough to properly secure my baby's carseat. I decided to purchase the Mighty Tight, after 3 cranks the belt was tightened and the carseat wouldn't even budge. It has been a month now since it's installation and it is still secure."
1,Very Disappointed,"I ordered this product for my son's carseat thinking that it would make his seat extra safe. The day after I ordered it, I read an Article in American Baby Magazine that stated products such as these have been shown to dislodge from the seatbelt in high impact collisions. Needless to say, I will be returning both of my Mighty-Tite's as soon as they arrive."
1,Mighty Tite,"Hi-We bought the Mighty Tite belt tightener for our infant seat. We thought we were doing a good thing by adding security to the infant seat. When our son grew into a toddler seat, we unbuckled the seat belt and removed the Mighty Tite. To our surprise, it had begun to damage our seat belt, and completely defeating its purpose! We were advised by our city police to remove the Mighty Tite and NOT use it. They said a locking clip is just as effective, and not going to ruin our seatbelt. Think about your child's safety and risk before you decide to buy it."
1,Actually unsafe,"This product is a very nice looking item. I bought it thinking that it would help me get my child's car seat in tighter than I can already get it in. When I had a meeting with a Texas State Trooper named Lonnie I found that they are actually very unsafe. They do, indeed, get the seatbelt on very tight as they advertise. But, that is where the problem is. I found out that it is actually stretching the seatbelt before it needs to be stretched in an accident. Thus, the seatbelt is unable to do it's job properly in an actual auto accident. Please, just use great caution when using after market products to secure a carseat."
1,I just dont Understand,"I work at a baby store where we sell the might tite seat belt ratchet. Now for the life of me I cannot see why people would think that this product is safe. If installing your carseat is so impossible that you have to use aftermarket devices to try to insure your childs safety you are wrong. Now keep in mind that these devices are not NHTSA certified and do not go through any crash tests. Which means that by using this device to install carseats you will be technically installing your carseat wrong. You will become among the 95% of people in this country installing carseats incorectly. Isn't your childs life more important than cutting a few corners to install their carseats a little easier. Wouldn't you want to have the peace of mind that your carseat is installed properly, go to a certified technition to get it installed, don't cut any corners."
1,DO NOT USE THIS,"This product is not recommended by ANY nationally certified Car Seat Technician. It can cause too much stress on your seatbelt which makes it where your seatbelt doesn't work properly in a crash. If you are having trouble installing your car seat google child passenger safety techncians to find one near you or check with your local Fire, Police, or EMS."
1,WARNING,I am a CPS Technician and from all the training i have recieved you should NOT use ANY aftermarket accessory with your child seat. If you are unable to attain a good fit take your seat and your vehicle to a CPS checkstation and have your seat installed by a certified CPS Technician.
1,An Aftermarket product - not recommended.,I'm a carseat technician thru NHTSA and this is a product that we do not recommend and ask parents not to use when they come to our car seat clinics. The reason? This is an aftermarket product which means it has not been tested by the government and we do not know how it will stand up in a crash. Car seat clinics are held nationally and we will be happy to show you correct installation of carseat using your seatbelts.
5,A great must-have product for all car seats,"This product is awesome! I bought one because my son's car seat just wasn't as tight as I felt it needed to be. As soon as I installed it and saw the difference I went and bought another for the car seat in my husbands car as well!Sometimes it is a little hard to get it to release when removing it, but with a little effort after a minute or two it comes off.Definetely a must have!"
5,Tested & BACKED by NHTSA & DOT!,"SOMEONE forgot to do their homework before rating this product; I, on the other hand, did not.Although the NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) & DOT (Department of Transportation) cannot officially endorse or approve aftermarket products, they have tested this device and back it in writing at http://www.mighty-tite.com/Pages/mttestBody.html . Check their overall conclusions:+In all tests performed, the Mighty-Tite complied with the applicable requirements of the FMVSS standards.+No significant effects of installation and usage were observed on the seat belt webbing.+Installation of the Mighty-Tite reduced the effects of the dynamic crash test on injury criteria specified in FMVSS 213."
1,Please do your homework before you buy this product.,"...Parents, the best way to protect your child in a crash is to have a PROPERLY installed, properly used carseat. Please do not rely on aftermarket products such as the Mighty-Tite when it comes to something as important as your child's life. The false sense of security that you get when you purchase this product - is just that. Either keep your money in your pocket or buy something truly useful with it (like double-fudge chocolate brownies or skinny cow frozen treats - depending on what kind of week you are having) and visit your local Child Passenger Safety Technician for help with your carseat installation problems."
1,VERY UNSAFE,"Don't buy this. It's not safe, can cut your seatbelt, and kill your child.You need to get a good install without this dangerous product."
1,Do not use,This device cut the seatbelt completely off in a auto accident. T-boned at about 25mph and it ripped seatbelt causing the carseat to be thrown. Thankfully no major injuries. This device will damage your seatbelt.
1,I do not recommend at all,"We bought this for safety, and then had to have it removed by the fire department, after calling the customer service department for the product who could not help and said I was the first call about this. We couldnt get it off and was told by the fire department who installs car safety seat that this was not a good product and they have removed several of these."
1,PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS!!!!!,"I am a certified Child Passenger Safety Instructor for over 10 years. These are NOT safety tested and can void all warranties for the automobile and carseat. You auto insurance may also claim that you used an unapproved product. The government has strict standards for carseats to pass crash tests FMVSS 213. If the product does not have that stated on the product then it can be more of a danger. If you can not install a carseat with less than 1"" of movement, you may need to move it to another seating position, get another seat or contact a Certified Child Safety technician in your area. (NHTSA, Highway Patrol, Police, Fire Dept, Health Dept,) Keep them seated and buckled."
1,DO NOT buy this product!!,"I have used and loved this product until today when I stopped at a child safety seat clinic. The technician at the clinic said that this product is VERY unsafe and can cause your seat belt to stretch and possibly snap during a collision. She also said it can ruin your car seat by making the seat belt too tight and stressing the plastic. I have recommended this product to all of my friends, but now I am letting them all know to stop using it! The technician said that this product actually voids your car seat, and your car's, warranty. If your seat belt snapped and your child was injured during a collision, you would have no recourse if you were using one. She showed me how to properly tighten the seat belt and avoid it loosening by twisting the part that it snaps into. If you are using this product, I would STOP NOW! If you are planning on buying one, I would not. Sure they are really great at getting the seat belt tight, but apparently they are too good to be true!"
3,Beware of third party items,"We had gotten this seat belt tighter for both our cars - a Subaru Outback and an Audi A4. For the Subaru, the Mighty-Tite was too bulky to work well - it was pushed up against the car seat and it was difficult to tighten completely. It fit well on the Audi, but when we got our car seat installation inspected, the police office checking our seat said that she did not recommend this product. She has actually had one break while installing it! Since it is not made by the car manufacturer and not made by the car seat company, you should be wary of being lulled into a false sense of security just because you have this product."
1,Do not buy this item!,"I purchased this item thinking it would be great for installing a car seat properly and tightly. When I took my vehicle in for a car seat check. I was told by a highway patrol officer and a car seat specialist that these are not safe and they threw it in the trash. Properly installed, a car seat should be able to be installed tight enough not to need this unsafe item. Your childs life should be the main priority here, not how quickly a car seat can be installed. This item should be removed from the market."
1,Using this product may void your car seat's warranty,"For all car seat manufacturers, use of aftermarket products, including seatbelt tighteners, will release the company from liability should anything go wrong. Save yourself the money and go see a Child Passenger Safety Technician and learn tips and tricks for installing carseats properly.This product may have been tested in its own lab, but that does not mean it has been tested with the seat you are using. If you would like to know whether it's a good idea to use, then call your car seat's manufacturer and ask them directly if they approve of this product."
5,Helped me secure the base of my infant-seat!,"I bought this product on the recommendation of a friend. It turned out to be one of the best investments ever! I had the base of my son's infant seat professionally installed 3 TIMES by Safe Kids Coalition and after about a month after each installation, the base had turned sideways and loosened out of the ""tight position"" they had installed it in. When I took it back each time and showed them what it was doing, they all blamed it on the installer before them. Once I bought the Mighty-tite, my problem was solved. It hasn't moved since and I feel great knowing my son's seat is in tight. When I check it to see if it moves more than an inch, it's so tightly installed that the whole car shakes! I highly recommend this to all parents. I even bought an extra one for times when we travel and have to install his base in another car!"
5,BEST WAY TO SECURE YOUR CHILD,My wife and I have been using the Mighty-Tite for over 2 years now. It makes the annoying job of fastening your child's seat simple. We actually have 4 of these (2 for each car).They also make a great shower gift!
2,Doesn't tighten enough,"I bought the Mighty Tite seat belt tightener after the one that comes with the carseat was left in granny's van. I have a '98 Altima and the seat is in the middle. First of all the tightener doesn't tighten the seatbelt enough. You can still wiggle the base to the left and right about 1 1/2"" each way. Secondly, the tightener is as tight as it will go and the base is like the Leaning Tower of Piza. When looking in the front of the car the carseat leans severely to the side where the tightener is located. Plus, the tightener has created a huge space where the seatbelt comes out of the seat. Wouldn't recommend this one."
3,Great Product if you need it.,I bought this product because I was unable to get my child's carseat and then the booster seat secure in our van. This product took out all the slack I was unable to get my seat belts to do properly. However a few months ago I found out in Texas at least you can call the DPS Safety Education Division and have your carseats/booster seats inspected in your car and they will give you suggestions and even adjust the seat to make it more secure. The DPS trooper told me that this item and other items like it are not required to be tested for safety and although he was impressed with the design and like the concept he reinstalled my carseat and was able to get the same results. He said I could use the Mighty-Tite but to keep in mind there is no safety test data to know how it would hold up in a crash. I still have it but it is in the glove box and I don't know that I will ever use it again now that I know items like this are not required to be tested.
1,Very unhappy with Mighty Tite!,"I purchased this product recently and wish I had not. I got home with it ready to install. For my car seat, I have to use a locking clip, which evidentally means I need to follow a different set of installation instructions. According to the instruction pamphlet, these special instructions are available at the company's web site. I am not sure why they could not have included them in the pamphlet. After a long search, I found nothing on their web site about installing the product using a locking clip. So, not only do I not know the proper way to install this product, but now that I have done more research, I see that the product may not be as safe as claimed."
5,A must have!,"We have two cars plus Nana's car, and the car seat has never been more pleasurable to transfer! It's easy to take out and even easier to install. The very elementary directions are connected to the might tite, so someone who has never used it before can install and uninstall it just and easily. It's plastic is durable and when we try to shake the car seat, the whole car actually moves! To wrap it all up - the car seat cannot budge with little effort to install. No more trips to the fire station to make sure the seat is installed properly. GREAT product -every child should have one!"
5,Mighty-Tite is Crash tested,"Mighty-Tite has been thoroughly crash tested at a NHTSA certified testing lab. In addition, Mighty-Tite has been used by 10's of thousands of parents around the world. Mighty-Tite works and it will help you get your car seat tightly secured in less than 10 seconds."
5,Saved Our Daughter's Life!,"We originally bought the MightyTite to help us tighten the car seat as much as possible. In comparing our car seat to that of friends, we often noticed how loose their's seemed - even those installed by certified police or fire stations! However, last weekend we were broadsided and our SUV flipped, but because of my daughter's MightyTite (and a 5-pt. harness on her infant seat) my daughter's car seat NEVER BUDGED! Our car is completely totalled, and she didn't have a scratch on her. This is well worth the [money]!!!"
1,Be careful with after-market items,"I was set to install a carseat with this until a tech informed me that it's an aftermarket item and isn't subject to testing. It pulls the seatbelt tightly enough that it could actually weaken it. More importantly, it gives the parent a false sense of security. This item isn't recommended by a LOT of carseat techs and again, is not subject to testing by NHTSA or anyone. Aftermarket manufacturers can make any claim they want and not have to back it up. Think twice before you buy this."
1,Certified Car Seat Tech.,"I am a trained car seat technician and I am glad to see that there are others warning about this product. Do not use this product! As for the car seat checkpoints... you should only have to go to one to learn the correct installation of that seat. After attending, you should be able to install your car seat on your own. Please, don't put your child at risk by using these products!"
1,Could Be Dangerous!,"I went to 2 separate police stations for car seat inspections and both officers told me that this product is unnecessary and could be, in fact, dangerous. I was told that it has not been properly crash-tested with the car seats. It gives people a false sense of security. A car seat should be able to be installed safely and securely without the use of the Mighty Tite."
1,Not Approved for Instillation with any car seat.,"We went to a safety check station to have our infant carrier/car seat checked, we were informed that this product is not necessary and is not approved for use with any car seat. We took our's back to Babies R Us. We also had to remove the little head positioner and harness straps from the carrier because they werenot considered part of the car seat and could actually make the car seat dangerous. This was very upsetting to us, but we complied with the recommendations and now we don't use anything except two receiving blankets rolled up to on each side of the baby to keep him stationary. Needless to say, we returned these items as well.Concerned,Grandma Lisa"
2,Not a substitute for locking clip,"I purchased this thinking it could be used to replace a locking clip for an infant car seat base. I think I had it installed correctly, but it did not hold the seatbelt in the same position. After about two weeks I've pulled it out and am ordering a cheaper locking clip. Maybe this will work when our kid gets older, but it's not a substitute for a locking clip."
3,Be weary of product,"I had originally bought the seat belt tightner for my son's car seat and my husband installed it without a problem. I thought it worked great, but the car seat check representative at our local police station disagreed. She informed me that this product was NOT safety tested and it is unknown how safe and secure it is especially in a car accident. She also informed me that it ruins seat belts. I would recommend to just be weary of this product and try to install the car seat without it."
1,DON'T BUY!,"VERY UNSAFE, Shreds the seatbelt! Don't buy! With LATCH available, and modern seatbelts there is NEVER a need for this. If you can't get your carseat in tight, find a carseat tech through your local safety council, or possibly police station or hospital."
1,Unnecessary and potentially harmful.,"Not only is this product totally unnecessary, it is potentially very dangerous - at its worst it can damage your seat belts, or fly off in a severe crash and become a heavy projectile."
5,Perfect for when you can't get the seat tight enough,"My husband was having a few problems getting our carseat tight enough in his truck, it worked fine in my car, but not the truck, this makes the seat so nice and tight in the truck it does not move at all , when we took it to the seat check at babies r us the lady could not believe how tight the seat was."
5,This works for me and my daughter.,I really believe this makes a huge difference in the safey of my child when she is in the car. I recommend it to anyone worried about their car seat not being tight enough.
4,Tighter than ever!,"With this handy device, my baby's carseat is very secure. And it's very easy. They say you should have the seatbelt so tight that the seat won't budge more than an inch from side to side. With this product my baby's seat won't budge at all! I would give it 5 stars if the release mechanism that is supposed to be toddler proof weren't also adult proof! It's really not a big deal to release it, though. I unbuckle the seat belt and unthread the belt from the tightener."
1,Great Disappointment,"The photo appeared much much much better than the actual product. The actualy product looks and feels like a very cheap thimble. To a point it feels as if the photo and the actual product are two different things.The delivery service form the seller is good and their other products are quite satisfactory. For the reputation, please becareful with the photo image and the actual product quality."
5,My hair has completely transformed...,"My friend turned me on to the Doo Gro Mega Thick lotion and I have been using it for about the past six months. I really liked how it tamed my hair more than any other salon sold product. I also use It's a Ten but I still need to use my Doo Gro because nothing makes my hair less frizzy. When other people have seen my hair recently they are amazed at how much it grew and how my hair has gotten fuller. I have naturally thin, frizzy, curly hair and my hair now is full long and healthy looking like the women who do hair commercials. We are all blown away at this product. I highly recommend it although the friend who recommended it to me can't use it because it's too heavy for her hair and makes her hair oily. I recommend it for people with excessively frizzy and thin hair!!!"
4,Doo Gro Works,Hi Ive only used Doo Gro oils & Lotions but they really work. The oil really makes my hair grow and the Lotion keeps my hair slicked back but doesnt leave it looking or feeling greasy I love these products so much that I've decided to use the whole line. To me it smells good but to each its own I guessDoo Gro Mega Thick Growth Oil 4.5 fl oz (135 ml)
1,GAVE YOU FALSE HOPES,DID NOT GROW AN INCH OF HAIR.IT IS NOT ALAPRECIA IT IS JUST LOST OF HAIR NO CHEMINALSJUST LOST HAIR
2,SSmall results,I got just the shampoo in the green bottle and i had my hair like a pixie cut so results would have been very noticeable. I noticed a quarter of an inch extra that grew every month. Maybe using all products will help though. Who knows try it.
4,Skagen team csc titanium,"Beautiful watch,very light and comfortable.Titanium is a must if you are allergic to metal.My only negative point is that the scratches are more visible on a black watch.Recommended."
2,Disappointing,"I was disappointed in this book. Most of the chapters were extremely short; it seemed like it had been thrown together and padded out to ""book"" length. This would have been much better as a pamphlet. Most of what should have been the interesting chapters actually tell you to look at some other book, or join a dojo!"
5,GREAT BOOK!!,"Author shows us how to use stick fighting for fun and self-defense. The techniques in this book teach you how to wield the stick with grace, power, and optimum effectiveness. You will also learn the history of the stick and all its forms: shepherd's crook, wooden swords, canes are just a few.I really enjoyed learning more about stick fighting. Another way of self-defense!"
1,Overpriced,"I was very disappointed with this book. Overpriced and overwritten -- it could have been condensed to a 20 page monograph. This is not coming from any ""elitist"" martial arts perspective, just a practical value-for-money perspective. The only valuable section is the description of single-stick fighting. You are just as well to search on google for single stick fighting, or look at the EJMAS articles for free."
4,Nice heavy duty skinner,While I'm not just crazy about the feel of this knife I will say it is well built. The brass slug in the bottom of the handle adds a nice counter weight for skinning big game. But to me the feel of the knife in the hand as far as grip wise it's just a little off to me but that is just IMO. The gut hook tip could use a little grinding down to me. It has a nice point but the point it's self is flat almost like a small screwdriver I guess. I took a fine file to it and put a slant tip on for easier penetration. But like all tools its all personal preference. So it's a good skinner just that's my take on it.
1,Not for inductive cooking,"We just bought a new inductive cooktop which requires iron cookware. We bought this pot based on the manufacturers claims of ""Inductive Ready"" stock pot, and it's printed right on the box. It is not. Place it on the cooktop and an error flashes indicating a non-inductive pot. More than that, after seeing how chincy the pot is constructed, very thin, lightweight. That was the first clue when we took it out of the box, the lightness which somewhat assured you that this was not a good steel pot. It went back within hours of receipt. Very frustrating to have to travel to a UPS store to return a misrepresented product at our expense for gas to and from the UPS store."
4,fair value,"this is a made in China pot, I don't remember that being mentioned in the description, having said that looks to be of good quality , large enough for most any cooking jobs."
3,review,"they are very small and cute,I was really excited about these,I know that I can only wear surgical stainless earrings, but I thought that I would like to test platinum, as it turns out, they make my ears itch.they are a little hard to get on and off, plan on having a friend help you as these are very solid earrings."
5,Right On,"Finally, updated info on setting up decent disaster recovery that I can understand. The other books I tried were completely outdated and way too detailed. If you need a plain English explanation of disaster recovery, and who doesn't these days, get this book."
4,Ty Beanie Buddy Smoochy,"The frog is the same as it has was 8 years ago. My son had one since he was a baby, and the new one looks exactly like the old one. My son loves it!"
3,Solid lock!,"This is a great lock to throw in your bags to have available just in case. It's got a little weight to it, but it's not bad. It's strong construction means thieves have their work cut out for them. Unfortunately, the tips of the keys (comes with two) do bend rather easily. It's easy to bend them back; however, after a few times of this I can see it eventually breaking off."
4,Good Bop Music,"I agree with the other reviews here, this is an album of great BEBOP music, but you should also check out the CD issueShaw Nuff, which includes all these songs, as well as a few others. I have that CD and the sound is as good as these excellent SAVOY issued CDs. And if you like this music, be sure to get Verve's reissue ofBird & Dizthat has the famous re-recordings of Diz with Charlie (the bird) Parker."
4,Groovin High,"`Groovin' High' is a pretty good place to go if you want to try Dizzy's music for the first time. For some reason this version has more songs on it than other CD's of the same name and makes for a great selection of tracks. There is a small essay inside as well which puts the music into greater context. If you're new to Jazz then some of this will take some listening to, but once you get a feel for it every nuance and tone comes shining though. Dizzy is a recognised master of his art and the music on offer here goes some way to showing you why that was. In addition you also hear the musicianship of Milt Jackson (one of the first Jazz performers I ever heard) and Charlie Parker who is also revered in Jazz circles. This is a solid Jazz album and well worth considering.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
4,"Dizzy's rendition on this album is innovative,fresh.","Fresh, alive. Especially Jealousie. Dizzy puts this mesmerizing latin number into a bit of a tailspin.You feel like you are in eye of this storm of a fiery Latin piece that you get caught up in the swirl of passion that is Jealousie. Only one other rendition of Jealousie has ever been recorded that can be said to be as innovative and daring. And that which employed a full orchestra of trumpeteers, cellists, violinist and latin percussions. The artists escapes my memory but I would dearly love for someone to tell me who they were. There were many recordings of Jealousie over time and this yet to be identified version stands on as high a pedestal as good ol' Dizzy's."
5,Kingdom Hearts is great!,"This book is awesome! I have been a fan of Kingdom Hearts since the game first came out and as soon as I heard a manga for it was coming out in America, I was excited. It follows the games basic story line from building the raft, to fighting the heartless in Wonderland. The quality of the art work is good and I found a few of the faces that Sora makes are quite funny. If you liked the Kingdom Hearts game, I am certain that you will like this book. I recommened it to all Kingdom Hearts fans."
3,It was ok.....,"I was reluctant to try the Kingdom Hearts manga. I really like the games, but I wasn't sure about the books...anyway I finally tried the first story. It was ok, but very, very rushed. The manga is loosely based on the plot of the games, basically an abridged version with a few minor differances. It's obviously for younger readers. There isn't as much action as there could have been. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either."
4,good book,It's a great book for kid's. My son is in the fourth grade and loved it. My other son in the first grade is now reading it and like's it too. Plus for the cost it was a great buy!
4,Would be three stars...,"I just got the Kingdom Hearts manga today and finished reading it. Overall, I'll have to say I wasnt completely satisfied. It was too short and the scenes felt very rushed. I did like it because I love the game Kingdom Hearts, and I love manga. Seeing it in manga form was great. The drawings were very good and the dialogue is good too. The scenes are also well done, but just feel really rushed. It was lucky I gave it a 4..."
4,Passed Parts,"Even though I'm 10 years old I actually read this book I think that the book skipped some parts in the actual game.Also,it's different."
1,Awfull Manga based on a great game.,"First of all, this manga is NO GOOD, IT'S AWFULL!!! Before I read the book, I thought this book was going to follow the story from the game. Instead, it is rushed, the battle scenes are not detailed, and the plot is no good (Since it seems a lot of the story is missing). Although the art is good, it is MUCH better to play the game than reading this book."
3,NIN is terrible...,Gravity Kills doesn't sound like that horrible band that Trent Reznor created. The only thing that they have in common is they use effects in the music. I've heard this Gravity Kills album and the first one but haven't heard the second one (so I can't comment on that albums similarites to NIN) but both were good rock CDs. This CD isn't amazing and doesn't break any new ground or anything but at least its an enjoyable sound that I revisit every now and then. This is basically a decent CD for when you want something new to listen to.
4,Good follow up to two great albums,"If you like NIN, then you will like this and is worth getting. The cover of Personal Jesus is great and the rest of the album is a good mix of metal and industrial rock. I feel that the first two albums, which are by far the better of the three, came out too soon. The style of music they offer is much more relevant today than when they first came out. This is also a nice change from some of the music being offered today which sounds too much alike."
5,The Ease of Being is always new,"The really wonderful thing about this book is that it is seemingly ""new"" each time you pick it up. A line or paragraph that touched you in one manner at one time will inspire a completely new experience on a second or third read at a later date. Jump in anywhere and you haven't missed anything; it's non-sequential, just like the present moment. Every sentence carries the charge of the entire teaching. Highly recommended."
1,don't let the photo fool you!,"i have no idea why they have a photo of a 'buffy the vampire slayer' vampire on this item, it is NOT at all like the one shown in the picture. i have no use for it, as i wanted the one that is advertised in the photo online. don't order this item, because even if they let you return it, YOU have to pay the shipping and handling both ways even though they are falsely advertising it!"
3,Fun craft item,"The fabric rainbow dye kit came on time, and my grandaughter loved it but has not used it yet. I like that the dye is sprayed on rather than added to the washing machine."
4,RENEWING THE FAITH,"LIFE IS WORTH LIVING BY BISHOP FULTON SHEEN IS A COLLECTION OF 24 SHORTBUT DYNAMIC TALKS BY THIS UNIQUE SAINT OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WHO PREACHED ON TV DURING THE SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES...BISHOP SHEEN HAS ANEXTRAORDINARY ABILITY TO TAKE THE MOST DIFFICULT CONCEPTS AND SIMPLIFYTHOSE IDEAS INTO UNDERSTANDING AND HOPE.TOO BAD THIS IS NOT ON VIDEO AS IT WOULD BE EXCEPTIONAL FOR ANYONE TO WATCH..HOWEVER, QUIET LISTENINGWILL PRODUCE QUIET PEACE IN A TROUBLED WORLD."
1,Life is Worth Living,"I never received this product. It was something that I was very interested in reading on my Kindle Fire, but it never showed up either on the Kindle or regular snail mail. I am not sure what happened."
3,Cleans well; bottles leak.,"We purchased a 2-pack of these cleaners to clean the bathrooms at work. They were a reasonable price so we decided to give them a try. When they arrived, one or both of the bottles had leaked quite a bit and soaked everything in the box. I mopped things up, screwed the lids on tight, and used them anyway. This product does a fine job cleaning and the smell is fine, but the bottles continue to leak slightly when used. This can get annoying when you start to have cleaner running down your arm."
3,Dispenser top too big,Dispenser top was a bit too big - you're better off using the free one's from the pharmacy.
2,not good,This bra is extremely uncomfortable and doesn't give good support. I will not buy it again. Bali bras that I have worn in the past have been uch better.
5,Comfortable,I love this bra. It is very comfortable and fits well. The sizing options were very helpful when looking for a bra. Thank you.
3,Bali Women's Double Support Cotton Stretch Wire-Free Bra,"At first not very comfortable, but after a while feels ok. Straps are always showing out. Otherwise it's good for the price."
3,"A good bra, but slight problems.","The bra came on the date that was set. It's a pretty bra, but I think they sacrificed some comfort for aesthetic appeal. I don't recommend this bra to those with sensitive skin, it can get itchy.Overall, I'm happy with this bra. It's a great fit."
3,"Worth a try, but not for me.....","I am constantly looking for a comfortable bra for work. I am full-figured (40DD), and want something that doesn't poke me, yet provides support. This bra didn't poke me BUT I was ""adjusting"" all day. I found that I had bulging under the arm area, and it just didn't fit right.On the other hand, it is very well made, and the fabric is quite soft. It might work well for a smaller woman."
3,comfort bra,"This bra is just a little too tight. The cup size is true, but the band is tight. I am a 36B, I had to put it on the end closure and it doesn't stretch throughout the day. I guess that's good but it becomes uncomfortable the longer you wear it. If there was just a little more room in the band I would be happy with it. I was afraid to go up a band size because the cups would have been too loose.Update: I decided to try again. I ordered this bra in a size 38B. It fits goood after washing and drying it in the dryer. So if you order it make sure to order up a band size."
5,Great cotton bra,"The white bra has more cotton than the grey bra, but either way it's comfortable. I wear them daily for chores and working out. It's not good for under sweaters, because they don't hide protruding nipples. Just don't wash them with towels, or the lint will come between the two layers of bra cup. I especially like the machine wash and dry aspect."
1,Never arrived after 2 months!,I was eager to recieve it but after 2 calls to Amazon Customer Service it never arrived. Full refund of course!
3,Good basic underpiece,"This arrived appropriately packaged and is an attractive, all-around, every day piece of underwear. Good support, no excessive bouncing about, and no ""pain points"" like you find with many underwired bras.Bali Women's Double Support Cotton Stretch Wire-Free Bra #3036"
2,Not terrific just ok,"comfort is compromised by the inner band ---in front it is a scratchy bare rubbery substance . the support is lacking due to the overall stretchiness on cup fabric, but helps if you need more room than a DD---still looking for that 4D support that doesn't look like it came from Boise Girder and Truss!"
2,Cheaply made,"I was trying to find bras that were wireless yet comfortable and supportive. These are not that at all. They don't support larger breasts. They shrink and bind upon washing. The plastic adjusters they put on the straps broke after the first wash. These are terribly cheap made bras. I will now only buy more expensive, quality made bras I can try on first and see how they are constructed."
2,Not very pleased,I was not very pleased. This bra is so uncomfortable it feels to small yet it is the same size I always wear. I will never buy bra's from the internet again.
2,Thin layer of cloth..no support,"I am disappointed wit this bra. I ordered Bali before and loved another style so I gave this one a try since it has great reviews on here. I tried it on right away after i got it in the mail. It was very comfy, BUT no pad or support at all (I am not a big girl with size 36C). They are just like a thin layer of cloth and what make them unacceptable for me is that my nipples were poking out. I can see them though my t shirt and this is summer, not even cold out. I sent them back right away. If you are more than 36C, this may not be a good bra for you."
1,doesn't fit,Cup is sized strange and all the straps are too tight.It is much too thickI don't like it
1,Elastic too rough,"I'm sensitive to any type of nylon threads or fabrics in my bras. They scratch and make me itch like crazy. But 100% cotton bras are hard to find, because too many places don't take into account the elastic or seam support that may have a low cotton content. So I've been trying a lot of different bras hoping to find one that uses materials in their construction that don't bother me.This one didn't work. It looks and feel like it's well made, but the elastic around the edges is horribly rough. The ends of the weave on the elastic are looped back into the material in a wide loop, leaving thousands of small, stiff loops on the outer edges to rub against my skin. But not only were the edges rough, the flat part of the elastic is very rough as well and feels like harsh woven nylon.The shoulder straps and elastic edging were like sandpaper. I couldn't even wear it for five minutes."
5,I love these!,"I'm on a 34C--the smallest size you can get in these--but I have narrow, skinny, shoulders and have always had trouble getting straps to stay up. I've actually spent most of my life wearing racerback or cross-strapped equestrienne bras to get around this. Not any more! Now I can wear normal bras that don't further flatten what little I have, and I don't have to worry about the straps falling! I haven't had any trouble with the band riding up, and since these are full-coverage, nothing pops out of the tops, either. Hands-down, my favorite bras ever."
5,comfortable fit,Perfect comfort and easy to wear on a daily basis. straps do not fall down and the cotton no wire bra can be used for everyday or as a sports bra.
3,Didn't Fit,"It's not their fault. This item did not fit me properly. As any woman knows, finding a bra that fits properly is a task, so it was a stretch that I could order one online and find one that fits. I ordered the size I usually wair from other manufacturers, but as usual, manufacturers sizes vary. Sorry it didn't work out. Now I know I really need to go in person to buy like I always have before."
3,Not received,I have not received shipment yet so I am unable to review. The brand is good so hopefully the product will be also
3,a bit itchy,the fit of this bra was a bit awkward. the edges rub against your skin causing discomfort. they went back.
1,Bali bra too tight,I have been wearing the same size bra for about thirty years so I thought it safe to order the Bali bra size 34D. I was shocked at how constricting the sides were while the cup size fit. Let me explain that I am a very petite woman. Most women as small boned as me don't wear a 34D! So that is why I was shocked at how tight the bra is. I purchased a two inch extender at Walmart which helped and I am planning to purchase a second two inch extender. No point in feeling like Scarlett O'Hara. I recently heard that wearing bras can cause breast cancer because they constrict the lymph glands in the breast. Being a three year breast cancer survivor I now feel good about wearing my old bras that are loose. I have bought Bali bras in department stores in the past and they have been great but the one I purchased on amazon.com did not fit.
4,Bra good fit,This bra had a very good fit. I always wear Bali as it fits well. I would absolutely buy again
3,Sizing seems off,"Haven't quite figured this out, but the proportions aren't to standard and when I adjusted the straps, whole bra rode weirdly high. Not easy to manage the many hooks in the back. Awkward design?"
4,Excellent bra but cup size was an issue,"I love Balis cotton bras. They are the only bras I can wear with my sensitive skin and not have skin issues. Unfortunatly i have gained weight this past few years and I needed a bigger size. Bali does not really have ""plus size"" bras. 42DD is the largest and it isn't any bigger than the 42D I was wearing. So in that respect I was dissappointed as I got a good bra but still can't wear it. Hoping to lose weight and get back into these."
5,The perfect wirefree bra,"Excellent support even for a C cup, absolute comfort, soft cotton, pleasant shade of gray (doesn't get the grungy look of white that's been exercised in and washed a zillion times) . . . I like it so much I wear this style every day."
1,Terrible Construction....,"Just plain bad fabrication. Unacceptably scratchy and rough, the ribbon straps fold in two where they attach to the rings at the top of the cups. There is no way to straighten them out to lie flat, so they bulge out under T-Shits.Also, there is so little material under the cups to form a band which would support the breasts, that the bra justs cuts you off there, again, causing bulging (and sagging). The Bali Women's Double Support Cotton Stretch Wire-Free Bra #3036 looks nothing like the picture when you get it on; what tiny bit of fabric constitutes the band is immediately swallowed up by the large breasts it purports to support. The only wire-free bra for larger women that has a substantial support band is theGoddess Women's Alice Soft Cup Bra, which I discovered in a bra-buying binge this summer.Finally, Bali Women's Double Support Cotton Stretch Wire-Free Bra runs large. I wear anywhere from 40DDD - 42DD in other bras. In this, I wear a 40D."
1,Not the same bra as it used to be...,"OMG this bra is so ITCHY, it's ridiculous. It rides up in the front, no matter what position the back hooks or the front straps are. Bali has changed this bra - it used to be great. Very disappointed."
3,cotton bra,"very comfortable, for the most part, but the lace along the rib cage is just a little scratchy... washing improves softness. Altogether a very worthwhile bra."
2,Fabric tore after several months,"This is a very comfortable bra. However, after I wore it for a couple of months the cotton fabric above the cup ripped on one side. I'm disappointed that it fell apart that quickly."
3,ok,This bra is just ok for me. The grips that are built in the bra are a little uncomfortable for me.
5,Very Comfortable,Fits well. Hardly feels it. Straps stay in place and do not affect pressure points. Maintains it shape and color after repeated washes. Think I will buy some more.
1,NOT HAPPY WITH MYSELF OR THE BRA!,"It is my own fault, I see, that my bras were an unpleasant surprise. I saw the same number that was on my former bras and hurriedly ordered them. The new ones were a soft knitted fabric in an ugly grey, not like the ones I have worn for years. Why not assign a different number to one that is so different? Bummer! I lost my postage for both ways. The picture looks like my white Bali 3036."
3,Smaller than stated size,This brand is tight for the size I ordered. I don't know if Bali runs smaller sizing as some companies seems to do. That practice seems backward to me. Any way this brand should be ordered a size larger in band size then you are looking for.
5,DC sneakers,These shoes were great. I gave them to my son for his birthday and he loved them. They are a good quality and look as if they will last longer than other sneakers he has worn.
4,DC Quality and design,"The expected quality from a DC shoe.Resistant, durable and with ""that"" design that we know."
4,Fascinating,"This was far more interesting than I expected it to be. I love that it seems to be one of the very first cookbooks where they found it necessary to actually tell you how much of what to use and gave standardized measurements, of sorts.Excellent information about beef and fish and other ingredients and a wonderful bit of insight into history. Some of the recipes would be fun to try even now, which I didn't expect. The section on how to equip a kitchen was fun to read as well.If you're into old cookbooks or just like reading about food and they type of things they used in their kitchens back then, well worth the free download!"
2,Ho hum...Where's Plum?,"This was my first Evanovich novel, and I am wondering why so many people rave on and on. Based on other reviews, I can see that I need to try again, possibly with a Stephanie Plum book. Full House is shallow, mindless, and only occasionally fun. Most of the novel's plot seemed paper thin and too ridiculous to be enjoyable.I read most of this by the pool, and my suggestion is that's where it's best enjoyed. Otherwise, just don't even bother. If you want a quick romance, try the Red Dress Ink series."
3,Dissapointed,"After reading the Stephanie Plum series, I was really dissapointed in the supposedly re-vamped and re-issue of Full House. At first it seemed pretty interesting, but suddenly turned sour. Boring, no real thrill. Plot is the same ole thing. Boy meets girl, girl not interested then boy sweeps her off her feet. I was in the middle of the book and skipped to the last chapter and that seemed to be a little more exciting. Maybe that was the re-write portion."
1,"Bland romance, little mystery","Major disappointment. This book is neither a good romance nor a good anything else. I'm a big fan of the Stephanie Plum books but cannot recommend this book. Wait for the next ""plum"" instead."
3,ehhh...,"It was alright. Not great. It was a cute story, not in any way believable though. And whoever else said the editing was bad was dead on. The names kept changing on you. And just at a ""critical"" moment is when they changed Nick's name to Neil. VERY distracting! I'm wondering when in the world she hopped into bed with Neil, since Nick was just there a moment ago. And the whole Joel/Joey thing was bad. They also changed her minivan to a station wagon at one point. I've never read any of the Stephanie Plum series because mysteries aren't really my thing, but if this was any indication of her work I think I'd pass.I'm now reading ""Full Tilt"", the sequel to this story, and the editing is almost as bad in it.I'm not giving a recap of the plot since I'm sure you've already determined what it's about, but I'll tell you to save your money on this one. If you INSIST on reading it though, pick it up at the library!"
2,Not the best,"Was a little disappointed being that the Stephanie Plum series is such a great read. This book was pretty predictable, and often somewhat hokey. I can't believe they're going to make this into a series...a series of what?? Please please, I hope that by the next book in this series they will have come up with a more 'adult', convincing plot. Maybe Janet E. shouldn't have teamed up with someone?"
1,Full House,"I picked up this book at the airport, trusting it would be similar to her mysteries, although I understood it to be part of her earlier romance attempts. I was very surprised at the amateur level of the writing. The plots were very thin, and the characters had little of the endearing qualitites I love in her mysteries. Stick with the mysteries!"
2,A Dud,"Like many other readers, I bought this because I enjoy the Plum series. If I had the talent of Janet Evanovich, I would have kept this one buried. It is not funny, but it is trite. Save your money."
1,Life is too short and I am too old . . .,"Like many others, I purchased this book based on the fact that I enjoy the Stephanie Plum books . . . let's face it, they are not literature, they are a fun read and allow me to escape for a few hours on a weekend. Full House on the other hand was a waste of time . . .Did others wonder, as I did, what could have persuaded Evanovich to agree to the rewrite and the republishing of this book? I finally skipped to the last two pages and then put the book in the bag for the charity book sale at work (for 25cents --- it's not a bad buy at that price!)Hopefully Evanovich visits this page and reads these reviews . . ."
2,Thank goodness she's evolved!,"I love Janet's books and characters, and while this book has some interesting characters; the dialogue, plot, and character development leave a lot to be desired. I read it in a day, so at least I didn't throw it in the trash! The romance in the Plum series is better than this earlier ""romance"" novel. It's not a believable piece of work. I did laugh out loud once, so there is a hint of the Janet that evolved into the writer we know and love. We all have to start somewhere."
2,I wish I hadn't bought it.,"I'm a long time fan of Evanovich and I've read one of her romance novels before. It wasn't bad, so I grabbed Full House as soon as I saw it.It was pretty dire.I don't know what happened but it was like a reflection in a fun house mirror; all the elements of the Plum series were there but distorted.It probably didn't help that the heroine was 38 with two kids. So am I and reality kept creeping in. Where's the millionaire who's mad for me because I can bake cookies?The secondary characters were oddball, yes, but not in the least bit interesting. The spark between the two main characters wasn't there. Ranger had me drooling, this hero couldn't do that if I were biting into a lemon as I read.And the villain? Can we spell 'obvious'?I really felt cheated of my money. I should have got it from the library."
2,"okay for a ""happily, everafter""","this was a usual, handsome couple. one of which is always wealthy, meet, love, misundertanding, makeup. I think she can do better."
1,not good,"This book is just an ikky romance novel. If you don't enjoy ikky romance novels, don't buy it!"
3,Some readers are a little harsh....,"I read ALOT of books, different types of writing, and I guess forsome people this wasnt the best thing Evanovich has done but I read the reviews before I read the book and I think people were a little harsh in their reviews. It was like Plum with the crazy characters, and I LOVE Stephanie, but sometimes I think the Plum series is a little too ""clipped""- this had more detail, so it was just different but not necessarily bad. I enjoyed the quirky characters and it made me laugh. Sometimes thats all I need from a book. I noticed mistakes in the book too, and I agree the editingcould be done a little better, but that is nothing new, ive come across that with other books too. Anyway, I had to say, give the book a try, you might find that you enjoy it. Ill definitely read the next book, while waiting anxiously for the new Plum book!"
3,"Not Plum, but an easy, enjoyable read","I am the typical Evanovich fan. I will read practically anything with her name on it and so I wanted to try some of her older stuff. This definitely was not a ""Plum"" novel, but it was a lighthearted, easy read. I didn't find myself laughing out loud very much as I sometimes laugh to tears at Stephanie's escapades, but it did leave you with a good feeling in the end."
1,Not worth the trees they had to cut down....,"I really wanted to like this, because I liked her other books- alot. This was far fetched and at best just fluff and filler until the plot takes off. The big problem is that the plot never takes off."
2,Billie is no Stephanie,"This book is supposed to be for fans of the Stephanie Plum series. Don't waste your money, it's nothing like Janet Evanovich's newer books."
2,"An interesting read, but not the usual Janet","Picked up this book on the spur of the moment finding Janet Evanovich's books a must light read. For those seeking a fix before the next full length Stephanie Plum novel, this might not be the best choice. The tale is certainly light enough with divorced mother of two Annie finding love and excitement with handsome Nick. The story moves quickly with usual red herrings. But certain characters seemed more paper-doll cutouts. Overall, a definite library checkout or purchase for a hefty discount only read."
4,Funny and entertaining,It's a light romance with some suspense and mystery thrown in and a bunch of hilarious characters. I love Janet Evanovich's characterizations; she's in high form here; parts of this book were so funny.
1,Horrible!,I could not even get through the first chapter without having to restrain the urge to yack. Couldn't even force myself to read it. And I say that as a huge Stephanie Plum series fan.
1,wait for the next plum book,"Compared to the plum books, this novel is a bore, and overly silly, i am sorry i read past page three, hoping it would improve. save your money for the next plum."
2,Have a hard time believing she really wrote this...,"This book is a collaboration with one of Janet's friends, and I have a hard time believing that Janet actually had much to do with the writing of this book! It starts out as a VERY cheesy romance (hey, I'm an avid reader and have been known to read a few romance novels) novel and it's just awful. The second half of the book picks up a bit of speed and becomes slightly more interesting, but then at the ending the speed is so fast you can barely keep up. It was as if the authors decided they'd better make this all a little more ""Stephanie Plum"" to keep the readers interested in the ""Full -"" series, and... it just made no sense.Of course I bought Full Tilt (the 2nd in this series) at the same time, so I had to read that one. That one was a touch better, but I'll review it seperately (;In conclusion, if you loooove Stephanie Plum, um... don't read these just because you feel loyal to Janet, like I did."
2,Overstuffed and unbelievable,"This book took a lot of patience to complete, and I still can't believe I read the whole thing.Stuck in midstream without a paddle, it floats between romance, mystery, mayhem and madness. Evanovich's usually quirky characters fly off the believability radar like stealth bombers, unfortunately undetected by my bad book warning system.What starts out as a rich man, divorced woman love story in a horsey setting, becomes a comedy circus of professional wrestlers, crazy people, insects and endless (and I mean ENDLESS) repetition.Evanovich and Hughes seem to have forgotten the KISS principle for effective writing, and I would recommend you forget this one.Amanda Richards, February 26, 2005(KISS = Keep It Simple, Stupid)"
1,Disappointed!,"I was very disappointed with this book. I bought Full House and Full Tilt based on how much I liked the Stephanie Plum novels. I thought anything by the same author had to be good. Unfortunatly, these books are just bland romance novels, like the Harlequin books I read when I was a teenager. I was so un-impressed with Full House I didn't even bother to read Full Tilt!"
2,Boring! No comparison to the Plum Series,"I love the Plum books. This one is no comparison. Hard to believe it is from the same author.A boring and cheesy romance novel. A very small portion of the plot is mystery - and which is slowly dragged through the story and then crammed into the last 30 pages. As for the laughs you get from the Plum books - forget it, not here. Don't waste your time or money."
1,"What's going on, Janet?","Wow! What a disappointment... I certainly never thought that the author who created the wonderful Stephanie Plum would EVER be associated with a book like this! It was pure ""dreck."" It read like a first offering from a struggling new novelist. No tension, no suspense, no plot, no nada!I felt after the Christmas book fiasco, (weren't we ALL victims of Diesel) that perhaps the lure of the ""big bucks"" had altered Janet's integrity. THIS book certainly confirms that.Shame on you!"
1,I don't believe she wrote it,"I think Janet Evanovich didn't write this book. I think Charlotte Hughes wrote it and Janet Evanovich is trying to get her friend established (published!). This was one of the worst books I've ever read and I'm a devoted Stephanie Plum fan. I think Janet Evanovich should think twice about putting her name on these books by Charlotte Hughes. I note there's a new one out right now. I have no problem with romance novels, but they should at least be entertaining. This book was not worth the paper it was printed on."
1,--This is a boring dud!--,"FULL HOUSE does not deserve the time it takes to read it. It's not worth the money and I feel annoyed that I even paid for it. The story is stupid and has nothing amusing about it or the characters. I purchased it on a whim because while I was in the store someone mentioned to me that the book took place in my area of Virginia. That was a big mistake! Where it took place didn't really make much difference to the sorry plot. Janet Evanovich is trading on her success with the Stephanie Plum books, and this story has nothing redeeming about it.This is the first time in years that I've purchased something without looking it up and reading the Amazon customer reviews. I apologize to my fellow reviewers."
5,FANTASTIC READ,"Pleasant hours of reading, Funny enought to make you laugh out loud when you are all alone. Make your day a little brighter."
2,I'm confused...,"As I was reading I noticed in one chapter that Nick is referred to as Neil and Joel is called Joey in several paragraphs. I'm not sure if this occurred because of them making the book ""bigger & better"" but it was very distracting. Why would the editor not catch this?"
4,Still very funny.,"I read a couple of Stephanie Plum novels. Unlike many of the reviews, I actually find this new series quite good. Of course you know need to treat this as a classic literature, if all you need is a light and funny book, say for a long plane trip, this is the book.I thought this will be just a romance story. Not only it has the same comical characters (like in the Plum novels), it has more romance but also with some elements of suspense. These will keep you finish the whole book quickly.Give it a try."
2,"Not up to par, but good for its time","I bought this with reservations, loving Plum as I do, and had to struggle to finish it. The difference in writing style is marked. It's a sweet story, but nothing special, or maybe I've just been ruined by Stephanie Plum. Please, Ms Evanovich, go back to Jersy!"
1,Very Disappointed!,"I was so disappointed by this book! I know it was originallywritten in 1989, but I really expected something much better since it was supposed to have been re-written to be bigger andbetter. I skimmed through alot of it. The characters and storyline were totally unbelievable and the romance and proposal happened way too fast. First Billie is supposed to be this strong, smart single mom, next thing you know she is marrying someone she met 2 weeks ago...Unfortunately this book is another case of a newly popular author putting out a not very good book to cash in on recent popularity. I'm surprised Janet Evanovich would get on the ""Put Out Anything to Make Money"" bandwagon, butthe proof she did is Full House. Stick with the Plum books, which are truly awesome, this one is so disappointing to Stephanie/Janet fans it's heartbreaking!"
1,Sophmoric!,"I am a big fan of Evanovich books; I love the Stephanie Plum novels. However, this novel was very sophomoric and quite predictable. I felt very let down by this effort with Charlotte Hughes. I would have rated this 0 stars if given that option!"
1,Talk about cashing in on Plum readers!,"This is an old book that was ""reworked"" and, IMHO, Ms. E should have let sleeping dogs lie. The author appears to have done this reworking to give we Plum fans ""more of the same."" Sorry, but this is so NOT that. I suppose if I was a fan of romance novels, this may have been a pleasant enough way to pass a few hours, but I'm not. For a while, I wasn't even sure I was going to be able to finish it. Granted, the last half isn't as bad as the first, but if this is what the author thinks readers of the Plum series want, I will be very wary of buying any more non-Plum Evanovich novels after having read this one."
1,Full House,"Having just recently found the Janet Evanovich Stephanie Plum series, I was excited about something ""new"" from the same author. As it turns out, I'm glad I read the Plum series first. If Full House had been my first Evanovich novel, I might not have returned as a Plum reader. This book was disappointing, to say the least. I read 76 pages and couldn't bring myself to continue, even though I rarely leave a book unfinished--this was the exception! It was dull and plodding, the characters were not believable, interesting, or entertaining, and there was absolutely nothing in the first 76 pages that made me want to know more about any of them. I'll continue to read the Plum series, but I'll leave Evanovich's attempts at light romance alone."
2,A Major Disappointment,"I have always looked forward to the next Stephanie Plum book byJanet Evanovich, so I was very happy when I saw this book andbought it. When I realized it wasn't a Stephanie Plum mystery,I thought it still would probably be good since it's written byEvanovich. Wrong! I found it dull, with little humor, andquite boring. The characters were flat and the dialog wasterrible. I devoutly hope that Ms. Evanovich will treat us toanother Stephanie book soon. I don't plan to buy any other bookwritten by her unless it's a ""Plum,"" always outrageous andhilarious."
1,Perfectly Dreadful,"I was sooooo excited when I saw this book in the store, as I love Janet Evanovich. What a disappointment! It is nothing but a junkie romance. To be honest, I only read 50 pages and had to put it down. It was so awful I couldn't see wasting another minute on it. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
1,Full House is a Bluff,"A Full House is what Janet Evanovich claims to have in this alleged improvement on an early novel -- but she's bluffing, big-time. Stilted writing, a banal plot, and characters shallower than most politicians. I'd feel guilty re-selling it for 50 cents at a garage sale. Shame on the publisher and Ms. Evanovich for conning those of us who enjoyed her later writing."
1,"Yuck, Yuck, and double Yuck","This is like teen-love-fiction, and by that I mean it's like a teenager wrote it, one who uses bad detail, cliche phrases, overused idioms, bad dialogue and poorly crafted plot.Meet mr. millionaire who teaches polo to a woman -- and they of course fall in love, slowly, boringly, painfully. Then the kids come in and the remainder of the book is like a couple dealing with kids, with no plot development. Yuck.She says on the back she's responding to a call for something like energy and thrills and sexy writing. Uh, not in this one. The only sexy scene is on page 138, and that's not very good either.The best part of the book is that it proves she really does need to go back and learn the craft of writing because either she never learned it or she forgot what she learned."
2,Boring Boring Boring,"I happen to really like Evanovich's ""Stephanie Plum"" series, so I decided to pick up this book. After reading it, and it was a struggle to read, I can only say I am glad I didn't pay hardcover prices to read one of my favorite authors. Ms. Evanovich has let me down.The book obviously didn't make the bestsellers list years ago - but now - the author is marketing it again....why, probably because she has a following who buys her books.Well, if the next book isn't any better than this.............I'll probably decide to read a few chapters in the bookstore before investing the money (hardcover OR paperback)."
2,"""Full House"" is every bit as good...","as the old TV show by the same name. You know, the one that featured John Stamos' hair, and introduced the Olsen twins? Well, this book is just as probable as the show.Evanovich starts with an interesting heroine and premise, and things go well up until the wrestler, Frankie is introduced. From that point on, the woman who's slapstick humor fuels her Stephanie Plum series gets carried away into the improbable zone.I finished the book and didn't hate it. Hope Evanovich continues to publish now that she's increased her skill and doesn't succumb to going back to her old work, which wasn't published widely, for a reason."
1,Lost Interest,"I really look forward to Janet Evanovich's ""Stephanie Plum"" series, so tried ""Full House"". While the beginning held some interest for me, in getting to know these new characters, the second half of the book just seemed to go down hill pretty fast. Dialog dragged and the characters just weren't fleshed out very well. By the end of the book I found I just didn't care any more and finished it just out of curiosity. There just wasn't any feeling of excitement, and no real sparks between the characters. I was glad it finally ended. Very disappointing."
1,Don't Bother,"This is the most trite and unconvincing writing I have read since -- well, now that I think of it, maybe ever.It is extremely disappointing that Janet Evanovich was willing to have this published after her very engaging, funny and convincing Stephanie Plum books -- as wild as they are, they have a ring of truth.There is no such ring in Full House -- it is straight out of Ladies Home Journal -- handsome, rich, sensitive guy who happens to be still single at 35 falls for cute divorced housewife who smells like chocolate chip cookies and has a good attitude. There is an undeveloped villian who pops up at the end; some almost funny side-characters -- but everything is too sterotypied to even be worth reading.This book makes me worried about the next Stephanie -- is Janet grasping at straws?"
1,What a disappointment!,"As much as I enjoyed reading Stephanie Plum series, I was sorely disappointed in this book. I can't beleive it was written by the same person! The book is flat, predictable and full of cheap romance novel clichés. I don't know what was this book doing in a mystery section at the bookstore; there is no mystery in it, and it's missing the down-to-earth humor of Stephanie Plum series. I couldn't bring myself to finishing this book, it was so bad. Janet Evanovich, I want my $8 back!"
1,we've been swindled!,"I want my money back!This isn't a new Evanovich novel, it's recycled garbage! This book wasn't even good enough to be a Harlequin the first time it came out - it was a Silouette - and now that Evanovich is fanous for her Stephanie Plum novels, they've recycled this piece of dreck to capitalize off of her reputation.I have never felt so cheated by a publisher as I did when I tried to read this book."
3,Ouch! A clunker from the otherwise-sharp Evanovich,"Having just finished all 8 in the Stephanie Plum series, I grabbed this Evanovich novel, hungry for more of the good stuff that makes those books such page-turners. Was I disappointed! Cardboard characters, cliche-riddled dialogue, far-fetched yet predictable plot. I am not sure if this book preceded the Plum novels - if so, the author has definitely improved over time. I'm sticking with the Plum novels from now on, and so should Janet Evanovich."
1,Janet Who??,"It is amazing that this book is by the same author of the Stephanie Plum series! This book was corny, predictable, and so unrealistic that the characters were not endearing at all to the reader. It was extremely hard for me to finish it at all. I kept thinking it would get better and I was wrong. The poor editing was my biggest complaint considering the main male characer is referred to as Neil instead of Nick right in the midst of a love scene! It doesn't get any worse than that. If you enjoy the Plum series, you will not enjoy this book."
1,"Don't Bother - really, just don't bother","You know, warning bells were going off in my head when I bought this book and I should have listened. This is a revamped, recycled early effort of this popular author, done in conjunction with another writer. In other words, she's a money maker, the publisher wanted to milk her for all she's worth, but she's too busy/not interested in bringing the old stuff up to date. About all I can say that's good about this book is that the characters are promising and in the hands of another author (think Jennifer Crusie) they could have really come to life. As it is, this book is a complete waste of time and I have only myself to blame (always listen to those inner voices). The irony is that I have not read any other of Ms Evanovich's wildly popular books - and I'm so disgruntled over this rip off, I probably won't."
2,"First in series ok, rest get better","I love The Stephanie Plum series and keep on the look out for more by this author. This first book in The Full Series is a rewrite from an older version. It is a typical romantic novel that is enjoyable once in awhile, but the mystery is predictable. The read is quick and light reading. HOWEVER the important thing about this book is the introduction Of Max since he is one of the lead characters in the upcoming series. The other books are better mysteries with a light, fun atmosphere you find in The Plum books, including the sexual tension between the main characters. I have read Full Tilt and Full Scoop and have now just started Full Blast. They are not as meaty as The Stephanie Plum series, but I still enjoy them."
1,Another Disappointment...,"To be fair, I can't give this book a thorough review, because I was unable to make it past the first few chapters. I'm not the type of person who usually puts down books once I've started them, but the characters, dialog and plot I encountered was hopelessly cliched and boring. I found myself skipping pages and chapters, and not really caring what happened.I might have been willing to give this book more of a shot, if I hadn't just muddled through another novel in the ""Full"" series and been so severely disappointed.Janet Evanovich is a very talented writer in her Stephanie Plum series, but I've found that her other books really miss the mark."
2,Full house,I was very disappointed with this book after reading One for the Money. I found this to be VERY ordinary and uneventful. I really wish I would have read the second installment of the Stephanie Plum series instead of this.
3,Full House,"Bille is a sixth grade teacher, home for the summer and missing her two children who are off at Disney World with their father. While taking polo lessons she meets this rich, know to be a womanizing man. Thinking she was going to have a summer to herself, he ends up smack in the middle of her life with his relatives to boot.This book has romance, mystery, some bombs and spiders and a few laughs. The characters are lovable and its a nice story. There were some funny parts, but I never laughed out loud. I liked the book enough to continue with the series and read the next, but I had expected more.Its hard not to compare any of Janet Evanovich's books to her Stephanie Plum series. Most people who read this have probably read the Plum series as well. If you are expecting the same from this book, you will be disappointed. If you go into it not expecting it to be Plum, you may like it."
1,Don't even bother,"I love Janet Evanovich and was very excited when I heard she was coming out with a new book so I wouldn't have to wait until next June to get a fix (even if it wasn't a Stephanie Plum book). Well, this book didn't help.It is so obvious that it is from her Harlequin days it isn't even funny. I'm halfway through and I'm not sure how I got there. I dread picking it up, I can't wait to put it back down. I was going to force myself to finish, just in case it got better, but I don't think I want to waste my time anymore than I already have.If you are desparate to get a Janet fix, get one of the old Plum books, but if you absolutely must read this book, then get it from the library and don't waste your money. It's not worth it."
4,Great Warm-up to a Masterpiece album,"I would go as far as to say this is a must-have companion to ""Album of the Year"". They are really great, sentimental songs about Kasher's struggles with his own confidence as a writer/performer/band."
4,And it was totally awesome,"Allright, this CD is awesome my only real problem with it, is the shortness. It's not even 30 minutes long. It's deffinately worth the $9 or so you pay for it. And does this vaguely remind anyone else of Badly Drawn Boy, like in Entertainer?"
5,My Great-grandfather's book,"This book was originally written by my Great-grandfather, Robert Vaughn, who came to this country from Wales. He wrote the book for his daughter, Arvonia Elizabeth Vaughn Sprague. The original book is extremely interesting, as it gives a very graphic view of what life was like in Montana during the latter part of the 1800s. I am intentionally spelling Vaughn this way because it was altered when he was getting a title for some land that he purchased. In Robert Vaughn's original book, the spelling of his name is the same throughout the book. I have not read Walter's reprint of Robert Vaughn's book, but the incorrect spelling of Vaughn's name and the fact that none of the descendents of Robert Vaughn were ever consulted about this book raises concerns about the accuracy of this book. My rating reflects the quality of the original book."
2,Very disapponted,"This dvd was only a waste of money. I expected new performances from the bellydance tribal superstars, but I saw only a collection of performances from the following dvds:- Bellydance superstars at the Folie Bergères- Tribal fusions vo1- Tribal fusions vo2- Tribal LA- Bellydance Superstars: 3D Superstars, Volume One- Art of Bellydance: Live From Shanghai- BabelesqueSo, if you already own the dvds written above, don't buy Tribal superstars! That would be a waste of time and money.I agree with the other reviewers: the only interesting section of this dvd are the interviews."
2,A HUGE WASTE,I bought this dvd hoping for some new performances but only found a recycle of other dvds. The only thing new is several interviews.
2,Just a compilation of othe work,"I have to agree with the other reviewer. I was so looking forward to this dvd, but it was just dances from the other tribal superstar dvd's. The interviews are a nice edition. Otherwise, pretty unhappy with this."
4,have these guys got it good or what,good book. interesting.Like a bio of animals rather than people. fun to read. i recomend it for adults and children alike.
1,Bad,"I didn't enjoy anything about reading this book. I suppose some might say that it was magical and full of whimsy, but I would call it intellectually impoverished, saccharine and clumsy. An ill-begotten disaster prompted by the wedding of an overzealous zest-for-life and literary vapidness."
1,Do not buy!!!,This is cheap and does not fit 2002 f150 save your time and money and don't buy!!I bought this to replace my f150 Mirror and the side mirror did not fit
4,Great natural crackers,"I am trying to stay away from gluten and try to follow an organic diet. It is hard to find organic gluten-free crackers or cookies. So I was happy when I found these.Pros1. Good flavor2. Gluten-free3. Organic4. Few ingredients: flaxseed, maple syrup, cinnamon5. Germinated flax seed6. Not too sweet7. Family owned company8. Omega 3/6/99. Easy to eat, not too messy, sticky and don't make crumbsYou need to eat them with lots of water to wash them down."
2,"Very healthy, but the taste it not there","I really wanted to like these, and I really wanted my kids to like them. Unfortunately, they just don't taste all that great - which is understandable given the ingredients. They are very healthy snacks, and I can maybe eat a bit of it - but I just don't like them enough to eat them and my kids tell me they don't like them either. Oh well."
2,I wish I liked these!,"I bought these because of the high nutrional value and I was really hoping to like these, but.... I don't! Since these have gotten such good review here, I'm hoping someone at work will like these. I think you'll either love these or hate them!"
3,Whistling TeaKettle,"Sometimes lid doesn't fit securely. When you move it around and get it to fit properly, then it will whistle. Sometimes it doesn't."
2,Much smaller than I expected,"When I purchased this item, I was expected Onigiri sized molds. These turned out to be too small for my purposes, which was quite a disappointment. (Hence the 2 star rating...)"
5,My War,"Short, punchy style typical of the way Rooney talks on 60 minutes. Very good view back of WWII as he saw it. Very entertaining and informative view of some historical figures-esp. Gen. Patton. Lots of wry humor/sarcastic wit."
4,Great book,"If you remember and like Andy Rooney, you will enjoy this book. As you read it you can hear him talking."
5,Biography - Andy Rooney,"Purchased for my father's library for Christmas. My father hails from Albany, NY, and he'd actually met Andy Rooney back in the day, as Andy had lived on the outskirts of Albany. As Dad had always enjoyed Andy Rooney's commentaries over the the years, this was a perfect choice. He's read the book already and thoroughly enjoyed it."
3,Horrible OCR conversion for Kindle version,"A good book, but the Kindle version should have been proof-read before being released. The text is rife with typos from the OCR conversion, some pictures are missing and all the pictures have a tag line of:SPECIAL_IMAGE-page0xxx_0000.svg-REPLACE_ME"
5,I always liked Andy and now I know why.,Having always been a big fan of Andy Rooney I read this book shortly before his recent death. Only wish I had read it earlier as this make me appreciate him even more. A very easy reading book that moves right along and keeps you interested from cover to cover.
2,"I, like many Americans, blame Mr. Rooney For WWII","The year was 1943 and I had been in a foxhole for three months. Was I in France? Belgum? Poland? No, I was in New Jersey - and it as all Andy Rooney's fault. Ya see, back in the summer of '42, Andy (or ""The Dodger"" as we ""boys"" ""called"" ""him"") had convinced me that the ""Krauts"" (or the ""lungers"") were planning to launch an invasion (or ""yoodle party"") of Jersey (or ""iutyggfs""). He was wrong then and, by golly, he's wrong now!The book? Didn't read it. Don't have time for that sorta nonsense. Durn no good neighor kids keep climbing the fence into my yard. I'll show them. Just like I showed the Japanese at Dunkirk!"
4,Nostalgic look back at WW2,"Reading this book is like having the last 5 minute segment of 60 minutes go on for hours. You can hear Andy Rooney with every page you read. The phrasing, the sarcasm. The wry sardonic observations, which after you read them seem obvious. I found this book an enjoyable read of a first hand account of the air war in London, the land war, taking of Paris and Germany and final observations from India and China. The book is more Andy's narrative of what he saw over there, versus a history. He does little to fill in the story around his experience. I suspect that I enjoyed it more having read several other history books on the subject.As always Andy is opinionated, however to his credit he largely acknowledges when they border on prejudice. This is balanced by a lot more opportunity than 5 of the 60 minutes to round out his overall view. On 60 minutes all you get is his sarcasm in this book you have much well rounded view...."
3,"Personal stories, but often lacking","Andy Rooney occasionally scores hits on 60 Minutes, but this book hits less frequently. Readers will hear about his dislike for things Army, especially his training days, and his frequent lucky run-ins with notable media reporters of the day that helped him fine-tune his career as a journalist. It's not bad; but the stories that show his comapssion such as those where he has been flying with bomber groups only to lose friends, or those where he is at the front and writing about people to send back home to their hometown papers are too rare.Rooney is honest in his writing, and that is welcome, but we see more of his opinions than we do the better-known war story compendiums now available. My War is defintiely about his."
3,Telling it like he saw it,"The book reads like Andy sounds on tv. Unafraid to give opinions and unashamed to describe himself, sometimes unflatteringly, this is a useful addition to one's knowledge of the events of WWII."
1,Label Studio Pro,Label Studio Pro does not work on Mac OS X Lion!So disappointing.Lion has killed Power PC application support!Is there another label application to suite Lion?
4,Bostwick is hilarious,"A great and entertaining film, and Bostwick owns the screen whenever he's on it. He also gets given all the best lines in the script. One of the few films in a long time where I genuinely did not know what was going to happen next. A rare gem, and well worth checking out if you're into genre fare. Horrific and funny. What better combination?"
3,"This is neither that funny or scary, in fact, it's kind of mediocre","I guess I missed something when I watched this, because I would not give it 4 or 5 stars and gush over how it's the best thing released in the past 50 years. This film has its moments, and most of those moments involve the deadpan delivery and sarcasm of Karen Black & Barry Bostwick. Apart from that, yeah, it has a bit of gore, and yeah, it has a bit of suspense, but nothing particularly outstanding and this is not something I would watch over and over and treasure for the rest of my life. In fact, just the whole setting of the town and the area in which this is filmed is just depressing. Worth seeing once, but beyond that, nothing to recommend to the world here. It's just OK."
5,Awesome Movie!,"Some Guy is fun, entertaining, and keeps you interested through the entire film! I highly recommend it and would buy it again!"
2,Will never wear,"The material is too thin, and they were too short and very snug in the crotch. More like tiny swim trunks than proper shorts. Not recommended."
4,Enlightening,"Great book. I learned a tremendous amount from Metzger's details. I was shocked to find out the truth behind what company was the first to deal heroin (so to speak) and the real people and dates of addiction, eugenics, and the demographics of the heroin addict at different times. It's full of information that ""I always wanted to know"" but would never have found out if it weren't for this book."
4,Useful Research,"Having recently written my Masters Thesis on Heroin in Contemporary Film, I found Metzger's book informative and interesting. Metzger focuses largely on the link between the eugenics 'cult of purity' of the early 20th century and the emergent anti-drug attitudes of 'mainstream' culture. At times Metzger may veer towards the hysterical himself, but his analysis of the beginnings of the criminalisation of heroin goes some way towards understanding the cultural formation of illict drugs and is a must for anyone wishing to explore the construction of the heroin addict. The book redresses the imbalance of 'legitimate' narratives, which simply take a moral stance on drug issues without a historical perspective. It's also an enjoyable read."
5,excellent value and learning tool,"There is no doubt that the 16 Beethoven String Quartets stand at the peak of the string quartet repertoire. Following this profound music with the aid of a musical score will greatly increase the listener's appreciation of the composition. Even the music lover uninitiated in the skill of following a musical score can manage the exercise with a bit of practice. In my experience the major hurdle is to work out the repeat bars. This large sized Dover edition is very clearly printed and, in presenting all 16 quartets, represents excellent value. A must for all who take their music seriously."
1,Confusion about expiry date - please check carefully,"The tablets I received have a tag that says mfg date 09/12. This is confusing as this date is in the place where the expiration date should be. I assume it means manufacturing date, but if this is the case, when is the expiry date? Because of this confusion I won't ingest these pills, and will return them because I want to be totally clear and certain about anything I put into my body. I am quite annoyed because I paid $4.99 for shipment and waited some time for its arrival.I guess I will now go to my local health food store and purchase from a manufacturer who provides unambiguous information about their product.Digestive Enzymes 180 Tabs by Swanson Premium"
1,Not worth the money,"Only purchased the book because it was required for class. Medscape free App is a better pharmacology resource than this textbook, shame on professors requiring the text."
2,"Good ideas, bad writing","This book has tons of great ideas and techniques, but is terribly written, organized and edited. Surprisingly, this is the second version of this text, and the first (""Non-toxic Intaglio Printmaking"") is far superior. This version needs to be totally reworked to make it readable and useable. Look for the first version or another book..."
5,Still the one ...,Plan-B Questionable is still as excellent now as it was when i first watched it about 15 years ago!! A great sound track to go with it.
1,Formatting errors.,"Though I do not doubt the literary quality of this great piece of literature, in this ebook, the formatting and proofreading quality (wast for waste...) is horribly distracting and is frankly terribly annoying."
3,inaccurate translation - but interesting,"This is an interesting book filled with proverbs that reverberate of a lost time when the Jewish community was in small villages throughout Poland and elsewhere.. The difficulty with this book is that some of the translations are inaccurate and if one know Yiddish, this is disappointing. The Author should use literal translation rather than trying to translate to some ill conceived ""idiom"" of language.. The Yiddish stands up on its own in translation.."
2,Redundant entries abound.,"It says 1001 but there are some that are repeated over and over. I bought this for my boyfriend who is Jewish, upon the suggestion of his father. I won't be buying any of my Jewish friends this book."
1,iggy,"i didn't like it. it was annoying. i guess thats beacuse i dont like iggy, but it was still annoying. dont buy this if you dont need it. you will waste youre mony."
2,New Mother,"This book was informative, but boring. There are better books out there to read about breastfeeding that contain just as much information."
1,"Very technical, lacks the feeling of breastfeeding","I read this prior to giving birth to my first daughter. I thought I was well prepared for the task of breastfeeding. Boy was I wrong. I knew the technical aspects of how to breastfeed but was completely lost on how to actually do it. Breastfeeding is such a touch sensitive thing that if you don't understand how something feels, you could get the latch wrong.The book does describe potential problems, such as mastitis. However, the descriptions are also very technical and left me without knowing whether or not I had mastitis.I wish I skipped this book and went right to Nursing Mother's Companion. I have breastfed my daughters for a total of 2.5 years and have never referenced this book beyond the initial reading."
1,Don't bother,"This book should be titled ""Rah Rah Breastfeeding!"". There was too much effort spent convincing you to breastfeed, rather than presenting useful information for nursing mothers. It's also filled with annoyingly sappy stories about mothers who choose to nurse.Just in case you think I'm anti-breastfeeding, not so! I'm still nursing my little one at 15 months, but I can't say this book was any help at all. The La Leche League website was far more informative and FREE. Don't waste your money."
1,"Encouraging, but essentially useless","Having already decided to breastfeed, I read this book (on loan from a friend) hoping for some practical information to help me feel prepared.This book has very little useful information, and far too many feel-good, corny stories about imaginary mothers who've decided to breastfeed.If you've already decided to breastfeed, you won't learn anything from this ""guide"" beyond what you've already learned in your pregnancy books. I'm now borrowing ""The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding"" from another friend in hopes of getting less propaganda and more practical advice!"
2,Save your money,I was not impressed at all with this book. It contained all information one can find on the internet. The book kept repeating the same information over and over again.
5,Must have for mothers who will breastfeed,"Whether you're going to be a first time mama or not, this is definitely a must have book for any questions you may have concerning breastfeeding. I got this book while I was still pregnant and read it before my daughter was born. It was a good thing I did because I certainly didn't have time to read once she was born!! It became a very handy reference on multiple occasions later on too."
3,Somewhat helpful,"I trust anything from this company. I didn't find this book told me all that much new information, and I recommend reading it before the baby is born because its a little much to try to muddle through in those first few weeks!"
5,Great book!,"I bought this book when trying to decide if I wanted to breastfeed. I was scared to death from all the horror stories I'd heard about bleeding, painful nipples, and starved babies. It has put my mind at ease. I am now confident I can breastfeed. It answered all my questions and concerns and then some I had never even thought of. Highly recommended for anyone who is breastfeeding, or even thinking about it. ( I also like breastfeeding for dummies)"
4,For moms,"I am a dad with one expecting. This was good for understanding the womans side of the story, though not the other way, nor doea it help with any relationship megatives that may come, besides saying ""it will end"". Still very benficial read."
2,"Introductory, but not worth your time","A friend gave me her copy of this book. After reading it, I fully realize why she didn't bother to keep it as reference! It cover the basics of breastfeeding, but left me feeling uninspired and frustrated. The writing style, with sappy made-up stories in each chapter, felt juvenile. The benefits of breastfeeding were pushed hard, and the particular stance about continuing to breast-feed for a long time feels like an unreachable goal. I'm not against breast-feeding -- in fact, I plan to do it -- but this book left me feeling more overwhelmed than prepared.The biggest frustration I had was in the chapter titled ""A Father's Role."" That chapter would have insulted my husband if I'd let him read it! The suggestions made in that chapter are blatantly obvious to any thoughtful person (mother or father).It's a good thing this book seems to be out-of-print; skip it and choose something more helpful."
4,Breastfeeding book,This book is small enough to fit in a pocket of the diaper bag for easy reference. It has a lot of information in it and a great read for expecting and new moms.
4,"A great book for the Hip Hop Entrepreneur, too!","Success is about having the right information and then knowing how to and actually applying it! This is one of the books we recommend highly in our Hip Hop Entrepreneur Bookshelf on our website!--Walt Goodridge, President Hip Hop Entrepreneur Association (Walt is also author of Rap: This Game of Exposure and, The Game of Artist Management, The Hip Hop Entrepreneur Lists of Exposure, The Niche Market Report, and other success tools for the Hip Hop Entrepreneur)"
5,I Love Kool n Fit,"Not only do I love Kool n Fit, I'm going to go spray some on as soon as I'm done here! It's a great product for aches, pains, bruises and tired, overworked muscles. If you can't have a massage, this is the next best thing! Use it even if you can have a massage. It is very economical, spray or splash all around the painful area, not just where it hurts. And don't rub it in, let it air dry. Keep it away from broken skin and keep your undies on when applying. I believe it is the best analgesic there is: works great, easy to use, not greasy and smells good! Gotta go--it's waiting for me.Kathryn Merrow - The Pain Relief Coach"
2,"Visible through a shirt, an under shirt, and a bra","These are a little to big for me (even thought I have big-uns). They tend to get wrinkles in them and you can see them through a shirt, an under shirt, and a bra all at once. Not my favorite. They are, however very absorbant."
2,Really bulky and show through shirts,These reusable nursing bra pads are bulky and show through shirts. I was very disappointed after using them the first time. Haven't used them since and have purchased others to try.
3,Thick enough to see under clothes.,"I have been using the Lansinoh Disposable Nursing Pads, but were given these Medela ones as a gift. They are much more thicker than the disposable ones and very easily seen under my clothes. It was not attractive at all. The Lansinoh disposable Nursing Pads are much more discrete and comfortable than these. These are nice that they are reusable but to thick for my taste."
2,Barely better than disposables.,"I received a pack of these as a gift, and glad of it. Buying these myself would have resulted in some serious buyer's remorse. These pads washed poorly the first time around, and felt ""gritty"" and a little rough to the touch. After a few more initial washings (hot water, clear detergent, no softeners), they didn't seem to improve much but were doable if I was out of my other brand. I tried them out at home, just to see if I was being too hard on them without trying them out, and discovered that the pads' absorption rate is poor at best, and wicking abilities are practically nonexistent. I looked like I wasn't even wearing pads, except for the circular ""frames"" they created around the milk spots in my shirt. If I had known the pads would work this poorly, I would have exchanged them at the store for another brand - or even disposables. At least with disposables, I know what I'm in for!"
2,meh.,"I was hoping to find a more eco way of dealing with leakage than using disposables. These work in terms of absorption for me (I should qualify that to mean I leak but generally during feedings or at night and not profusely, but enough to soak 50% of the surface of my bra at a time).Unfortunately, they are so thick they show through my more tailored clothes (flowy, patterned tops seem to remedy much of this problem). The stitching is rough and itchy. Once the pad is washed it's very ripply and won't sit flat (which is the biggest annoyance for me). They're great if you plan on being a slovenly hermit at home, but I wouldn't want to wear them in public."
2,Leaked right through,These pads don't provide much leak protection. Try bamboobies instead-much better leakage protection! They also look lumpy under your bra.
1,They bunch up after washing. Buy Milk Diapers instead.,"The medela ones bunch up horribly after each wash, so that they're really lumpy and noticeable. I would never buy these again. Try Milk Diapers, especially the 4 layer ones (unless you leak heavily, then I would get the full 5 layers). those stay nicely shaped wash after wash and I will even wear them to work because they're discreet. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't sell Milk Diapers but look around. I bought them at our hospital's baby boutique. [...]"
2,Very Obvious,"These wrinkle up so much when you wash them and do not retain their shape at all. I only wear them at night to bed, because they show thru clothing so badly. They also do not have a large diameter that they cover, so if they shift you may still leak onto your clothes."
1,Leaky,"I bought these prior to my son being born/before breastfeeding. I started using these in the beginning instead of the dispoables because they are less wasteful. I found these very bulky and would wake up every morning with soaking wet cotton breastpads, bra, and t-shirt. After that, I switched to the disposable medela breastpads a friend gave me to try; they are super thin and very absorbent and only $10 for a month supply (you only need to use two a day, they are that absorbent)."
5,good and soft nursing pads,"Good and soft nursing pads, more discreet than other pads, hold up well after several washes."
2,soaks thru easy,very comfortable and stay put pretty well. however the slightest leak and they seem to soak through easily not recommended for those who leak a lot
2,They are OK,These pads did not work too well for me. They held up well in the wash but were not very absorbent. Maybe I was just leaking too much. The disposables worked best for my needs.
4,Nursing Mother,"I had used this product due to the dissatisfaction with the disposables, which I had to use more than one. I managed to escape throught the day without any accidents due to leaking or my enthusiastic baby. I recommend this item to all nursing mothers. I will definately save you from embarrasing situations."
2,Doesn't lie flat,You can see these through your bra...even a think padded bra. And they don't lay flat so they aren't very comfortable.Try the LLLI Washable Nursing Pads. I have tried every washable brand and these are the best!
3,Great idea in theory...,"I didn't want to be wasteful with all of those disposables, but even with my thickest bra these were visible, and in order to have enough around to always have a clean set available it just seemed silly (I mean, new mom nursing a baby isn't doing laundry very often... unless you're doing cloth diapers I guess, in which case maybe this makes a ton of sense...)"
1,Not worth it!,I purchased these to try to help save the environment. I go through lots of disposable nursing pads so I thought reusable ones would be a better way to go. But these were so bulky and uncomfortable I had to quit using them. Don't waste your money on this product.
3,electronics are a problem,"I have a DMI airhockey table (without electronics) and am impressed with the quality and design, so I decided to purchase a foosball table for my kids. The table is also impressive to look at and the quality of the handles and players are great for this price range. The side rails that stick to the side of the playing surface are kind of a waste as they continually peel off and look ""cheap"", but the biggest problem is the electronic scoreboard- the connections keep falling apart and i had to try to tape the connections together and even then the electronics don't work. DMI offered to sent a new end piece to their credit."
4,tripfest,"a rather trippy and soothing piece of music that spirals its way into your aural labyrinths. It's whimsical, jazzy and projects a fresh and unique sound."
1,op-jb a hoax,"The book falls into either the category of a hoax or into expensive toilet paper. There are so many ridiculous ""facts"" that no one should ever even remotely believe any part of it. Being taken to Ireland by a naval gun boat, armed to the teeth, when there was a perfectly good ferry to Belfast (I used it)and road to Dublin is one glaring idiot story. The huge number of support staff smuggled into Berlin is another. But the winner is the taking out Ian Fleming by Lysander but leaving Martin Borman.All you can give the author is he managed to con some money out of the public and publisher with mediocre writing."
4,Great fiction...preposterous history,"The author of ""OPJB"" claims his memoir is an account of how he helped a major Nazi war criminal and Hitler's closest advisor, Martin Bormann, escape Berlin as the Soviet army occupied the capital.It is a riveting adventure tale although I didn't believe a word of its ""facts."" If the author had presented the book as the fiction it is, ""OPJB"" would be a minor classic among World War II novels.Still, it's a fun read as long as you take it with a mountain of salt.Frank Sanello"
3,Merely Mediocre,"The pendant is pretty, and it was inexpensive as far as jewelry goes, but when the product finally came, I was a little disappointed. The stone is skewed in the setting since the right post is thicker than the left. It's not significantly noticeable when viewed from the front though, so I didn't mind. Also, browse Netaya's website before buying through Amazon. I found a 10k version of the same pendant on sale for less. So if carats don't matter, you might find the better deal elsewhere."
4,A empowering book for women to learn how to forgive and believe in yourself,This book is very powerful and it will enable tools for you to take charge of your life. It brought out every emotion in me imaginable. It addressed many of the issues women endure from past to present.As an author of Embrace the Light-a womans story through poetry to touch your heart I was touched by this book.
5,informative and interesting,"I highly recommend The Pilgrim's Italy for those to whom travel is an inner as well as an outer adventure, and sustenance for the soul as well as the palate. It complements other guidebooks by providing informative tips for pilgrims that are not readily available in one place - shrine hours, for instance, places to meditate, useful Italian phrases and nearby places of interest. It also pulls one in with fascinating glimpses into the lives of some of the rare individuals who have achieved sainthood, and opens one up to the possibility of the miraculous."
5,Wonderful Book,"I found this book to be very informative and inspiring. I recommend it to anybody who is planning travel to Italy. The combination of maps, specific shrine information (hours, phone numbers, even websites), and the authors' engaging writing style makes this excellent book truly unique among travel guides."
2,No St. Benedict or St. Scholatica,"I received this book today and am unpleasantly surprised and dismayed that I cannot find in it St. Benedict, sometimes called the father of western monasticism, nor his sister St. Scholastica. Even non-Benedictines know of the rule of St. Benedict, which is a guidelines for monastic communities. Neither Subiaco in Umbria, with both St. Benedict and St. Scholastica monasteries, nor Cassino, with the great Monte Cassino monastery which Benedict founded later, are included. I bought the book largely because I am planning a trip to Subiaco; this book is no help. If you want to learn about St. Benedict and St. Scholastica, Subiaco or Monte Cassino, you will have to go to The Christian Travelers Guide to Italy or to somewhere else. The Pilgrim's Italy is also larger and heavier than The Christian Travelers Guide, though the later still has a lot of information."
5,Gotta' Hear this One!,"Jay McShann is the most under-rated and unknown of jazz musicians. His playing, singing, and historical importance should place him as well known (and even more importantly), well listened-to original in the realm of Kansas City Jazz.Look his bios up on the net. Be amazed.If you don't know Jay, I urge to use this wonderfully produced CD as a starting place. The playing of the band - Milt Abel, Duke Robillard, Maria Muldaur, and Johnnie Johnson is terrific, and Jay's voice is in fantastic form.The term, Kansas City Jazz, gets thrown around a lot, but now Jay's gone, and KC Jazz will be forgotten if we don't keep doing our homework...If you want to pretend you know something of jazz, you must know this CD.(and... the intgerview at the end of the CD is worth the price of the CD - thanks to an unusually thoughtful producer)"
3,Good read,"Good read, didn't propel me to read the next one or having me reading late into the night but enough to keep hold of me through the book. If you like Jane Austen, this is an acceptable book though you wont confuse it with a real Austen novel. The characters are all a bit light on development but still moderatly believable. In short, it does pretty much what the book set out to do."
4,FAST READ,"was eager to read this book and it was a very good read. couldn't wait to get to the end. won't tell you too much about it, except to say you will probably like it very much..."
3,Interesting but slow moving story,"I was hoping for a series of books that would engage me and make me want to read them, one after the other. While this book was interesting, there was not sufficient intrigue or interest to move on with the other books in the series."
1,Minerva: The First Volume of Six Sisters,"Yes, I am over thirteen! When I was thirteen I would not have indulged in such infantile silly trash. I do not know how I got seduced into purchasing this book. Read the reviews and believed them. Now I look back to see what they said, and all I can say is that they must have been written by very infantile kids. The best part of the book was that it was under 200 pages. I read it to the bitter end, which just stopped abruptly and had no end really. I guess that is a ploy to encourage people to order more of the same trash. I can read anything, but this is by far the worst I ever read, so bad that I felt embarrassed for the authors, and to think it took two of them to dream up this silly nonense.It is the first time ever, that I have read a book and wanted to demand a refund. I should have been paid to read it.Debby Alden"
1,minerve first volume,not very interesting more for a school girls reading. The story line is very light with not much deepth. i won't be reading anymore of this series in the future
5,I visited Ganymede too !,"This is a MUST HAVE BOOK, contains amazing information just about EVERYTHING YOU EVER WANTED TO KNOW, I strongly suggest you read this book ASAP with your family.Get it! Now!"
2,Good product for outdoor fire pit - INCORRECT MEASUREMENT !,Good product but trouble with size that was sold. I bought several of these tubs in 2 different orders. 1st batch I thought I was getting 12.5LBS tubs and got those .. i figured I needed much more for the job so on my second order I selected 25 lbs tubs. This is simply a lie I got the same 12.5 lbs tubs. If you see 25 lbs tubs don't count on itthe product is easily to mix and use.. I mixed about 1/2 tub at a time because I had to regrout a bunch of seams in an outdoor firepit.. Do it when you can have above 40 degree weather for 48 hours ... after 3 months the concrete seems to be set well and not seeing any cracks and we have had massive fires in the pit. PS we are covering our outdoor firepit with a cover when not in use to prevent water from building up
2,Agreed: need a new editor,"The book has many good features, and I've made some great breads with it. But it is very annoying to run accross silly errors that a half way decent editor should have caught. The worst mistakes are in proportions, which are obviously very frustrating (particularly if you've spent money on the expensive flours Leader incorrectly suggests are crucial). Other reviewers are correct that the number of pages could have been drastically reduced. Frustrating is the fact that while there is an enormous amount of repetition, some important aspects are given only cursory treatment: e.g., how to form the loaves, how to make breads from straight dough. Also annoying is his suggestion that you reuse plastic wrap. The fixation on temperature is too much as well. When my house is warm, it's warm, and when it's cool it's cool, and the bread does fine in both, although it moves faster the warmer it is. My book fell apart very quickly, too."
3,Good enough to suffer the BAD,"I discovered ""Bread Alone"" about five years ago and have been baking from it almost weekly over the period. I have greatly enjoyed creating breads using this book. My life has been made greater for the experience. However.....I agree with all the negatives so well discribed in other reviews. The 300 plus pages could be reduced to 50 with no loss of information. Many of the instructions are ambiguous,repetitious and confusing. There are mistakes. One specific example, pg 290 ""Rose Levy Jewish Rye"". Omitted the addition of fluid for the ""Final Dough"". The book should be edited."
4,buy this book,"This book is not for the beginner or the professional baker. But if you occasionally bake a loaf or two (The majority of home bakers), you'll learn a lot about bread baking. Explanations are clear and detailed with total times (hands on and wait times) listed in each recipe."
3,"Good read, but the detail level is tiresome to extreme.","Learned how to make a good sour-dough bread and a marvelous hearth bread, but the level of detail is extreme and very boring. As a previous reviewer suggests, the detail could be cut at least by half or more and there are several mild contradictions and/or errors that would have been removed by an editor familiar with bread-making. After all, how many times must you be warned about spraying a hot oven light and the tiresome emphasis on adjusting temperatures to exactly 78 degrees? Also, the mechanical book construction is poor at best and careless by any standard. The book fell apart just from a few days of use."
5,It's Good!,"Perhaps you're wondering whether or not to buy this CD. Well, I bought it and am glad to report...it's good! Don't let that other unfortunate CD, ""Dylan and the Dead,"" steer you away from this. Jerry really shines throughout, voice and guitar.His solos, for example, on She Belongs To Me are at the level of Morning Dew, i.e., it's like listening to an angel play. I defy anyone to listen to the rousing All Along The Watchtower without concluding that's it's just as good as the immortal Hendrix version. Dickie Betts makes a great guitar contribution on It Takes A Lot to Laugh, and Jerry is A+ on Baby Blue. The last song on the CD, Man of Peace, is a fantastic rehearsal with Bob (Dylan) not Weir, ha ha. Bob's voice is tough and Jerry's guitar phenomenal. On the bonus CD, check out Mighty Quinn. It really swings in a Mississippi Half-Step style. All in all, NICE!"
2,An unpopular review,"While there are a few shining moments on here... this overall is an unworthy purchase. I confess that my personal prefence in live material sways towards the ""Primal"" period of 69 - 73. Most of the material on here is from the late 80's and reflects many of the weaknesses prevelant in live recordings from this period: Bobby Weir's often jokey / off key vocals and Jerry's sometimes listless playing. The lone track from the early 70's (#6 - It Takes a Lot to Laugh...) is a peach, featuring Dicky Betts playing ying to Jerry's yang in an extended jam. The last track is the only one actually sung by Dylan & is quite an improvement on the universally panned ""Dylan & the Dead"" material (and shows what that projecct/tour could have sounded like on record if they had meshed a little bit better).But, then that's just my opinion. And opinions are just like [back cracks]..... everyone has one."
2,Wonderful when Garcia is singing....,"...but Weir's phrasing is just awful. And that falsetto, man! Not to mention Phil Lesh murdering the lyrics to Tom Thumb's Blues: who in their right mind would change a great line like, ""I started out on burgandy but soon hit the harder stuff"" to ""I started out on HEINEKIN but soon hit the harder stuff.""...? The stars are for the Garcia material, which is beautiful and sublime, especially ""Baby Blue."" Weir and Lesh, on the other hand, are hams."
2,Where's Jerry?,"This is a real disappontment.. I am not a huge Dead fan but I love the way Garcia does Dylan's tunes--he always seems to find something in the songs I didn't know was there. So why is this a disappointment? Well the songs were chosen by Bob Weir and surprise!! all but three feature his vocals. I felt gypped especially after hearing the great versions of ""She Belongs To Me"" and ""It's All Over Now, Baby Blue"" turned in by Jerry. If you like Ratdog go right ahead..but if you were hoping for the definitive ""Jerry Does Bob"" go to the Jerry Garcia Band Live record on Arista from 90 or 91."
1,"great concept, terrible execution","Maybe its because I saw them play an incredible Tom Thumb and Desolation Row on consecutive nights in '92, but many of the songs on here are just bad. Phil has never been a great vocalist, that's just part of his appeal. But listening to him on this is painful. Bobby omits an entire verse and screws up the Ezra Pound/TS Elliot line in Desolation Row. The bonus disc Quinn just stinks. ""It Takes a Train"", ""Queen Jane"" and ""She Belongs"" are the only decent tracks. I find it hard to believe that David Gans couldn't come up with better takes of these songs. I was so excited to see the track list- then I sat down and listened to it. Anyone who says this is ""The Best Ever!"" can't possibly have listened to many Dead shows. I'll stick to my boot tapes, thank you."
5,"goofy concept, but excellent","If you love the Dead, Dylan, or music, buy this. There are no bad cuts. We all could complain- I wish ""Visions of Johanna"" was on the disk, but we got ""She Belongs to Me"" and that is just fine- a little too heavy on the Bob, a little light on Jer-I wish at least on Vinnie/Bruce jam was included- perhaps a Tom Thumbs Blues-With one exception- A ""It Takes a Lot to Laugh,"" '73 with Allmans in DC,it is all Brent era. Personally, this is exactly the type of CD I generally do not buy- A commercial concept CD invented to suck my cash-But it is so good-All I can say- if you consider buying this, buy it- well worth the bucks!!"
4,"somewhat deadified, but not enough","I like Dylan and the Grateful Dead; I own around 100 cd's by these tw artists, most of the Dead's being doubles, triples or quadruples.They are natural (or cultural) partners and indeed, I like Dylan and the Dead more than this.I think the Dead is somewhat handicapped when they play covers that are basically very good songs, but do not create good improvising possibilities. They play them in their usual ramshackle way, somewhat funky, somewhat jazzy. They may make them a little their own in this way, but for me it doesn't work. A dissapointment."
1,disappointed,"probably best suited for the hard core deadheads. although there are some highpoints, a good deal of the playing is listless and clumsy. too heavy on the weir vocals - or i should say bad weir vocals; he can sing but sometimes he tries too hard. these are the best performances they could find?"
1,Cheaply made; Falls apart,"This costume is so cheaply made. The wand fell apart within 15 minutes; the body suit is held together by Velcro and comes undone and is very uncomfortable. The ""fur"" is coming undone already and she wore it for a simple event for 30 minutes. The wings have velcro straps that came apart at the event and I had to rig it to stay on. I had to hot glue those back together. I bought this for my 4 yr old and I bought the bumblebee costume for my 1 yr old. I would NOT recommend this costume. Very disappointed and my daughter has to wear it 3 more times and now I have to sew it; glue it; tie it."
4,Adorable,"Perfect costume for a growing toddler, she looked yummy, the winds makenit look like a very expensive costumei highly recommend it"
2,"Quality fine, size so far off","I ordered this very cute costume for my 3 and a half year old daughter, who is on the small side. The quality was just fine and it had cool accessories but the main part of the costume, the leotard, was way too small. We could not even get it snapped it was so tiny. So in the future, the packagers needs to figure out better sizing."
3,Decent,"Product is cheaply made, but not bad for the price, I guess. I'm glad that I didn't pay full price at the Spirit store. Halloween is next week, I hope it last through the night."
1,What's with the size discrepancies?,"You'd think that if these people are in the garment industry, they'd get these size issues straightened out.It says ""Toddler"" in the selection criteria, but when you look at the sizing information it says:General size = ToddlerSpecial Size = (2-4) (1-2 yrs)Height (neck to bottom) =35"" - 39""What in the world is that describing? So size 2-4 is for a 1-2 year old? Huh? And neck to bottom, does that describing neck to feet or neck to crotch, where the costume ends? Why don't they just give the height of the child? Either way, that's not describing anything close to the height of a typical (or even a 95 percentile) 1-to-2 year old child.Is there some sort of language barrier problem?"
5,a good mixture,"I found this CD after trying to find a compilation CD containing ""love is in the air"" also has a nice song by Doris Day, the other Ballroom songs really aren't my style but worth it for what I wanted."
2,Only partial coverage,"I do not see how anyone could possibly pass the exams that thismaterial supposedly helps you study for because things like installingNT are on the test and not addressed by the book. The authors may beg to differ by mentioning that the book references other materials frequently (the NT help file,etc). Too me this is a poor excuse. Don't try and cover 50% of the material in the book and then just use quirky references to cover the other 50%. To summarize... Not too bad of a book but there are so many others that this one is a poor choice."
1,very very disappointed,I purchased the earrings for my 17 year old daughter. The SECOND time she wore them one of the backs fell off and she lost the earring and the other earring lost 3 of the stones. We are extremely disappointed at the terrible quality of the earrings. I did not save the receipt because I thought everything would be fine but now felt I totally wasted my money and wished I could get a refund!!!
2,Cheap Jewelry,"This is the 2nd time I purchased from Eve's Addiction and I thought the jewelry was cheap for the amount I paid for it. Their photography is deceiving. I first purchased a bracelet for a present and was very disappointed when i received it. I returned it. I then purchased earrings and antoher pair for Christmas gifts and again, disappinted. One of the earrings looked like it had cut cz but when I received it it was just sterling silver with raised dots that appeared in the photo to be cz. I wouldn't buy from them again."
1,TG 1200,"Piece of crap runs ok everthing on it falls apart or breaks. From the time it was taken from the box to the end of the week had to handle it like it was an egg. DON""T BUY!!!!!!!"
2,"Needs ""Handle Like Eggs"" for Shipping",The TG1200 Portable Electric Generator sold by Amazon.com (from Eastern Tools) is inexpensive and this is reflected by the (lack of) quality of the product. I expected that. The problem was caused by the very poor quality of the packing. One dollar spent on packing material would likely have made this purchase a better experience.
1,blow up,"Bought this generator to power a 60 watt light and a small 110 volt air conditioner.Unit worked pretty good until it blew up, catching fire.There was no sign of problem. Had used the generator the day before and refueled it. Made sure there was no fuel on the generator.Would prefer to have a small Honda, but to costly.Have pictures of the unit."
2,Poor Quality,I used this generator once & it had a loud knocking noise & was very difficult to start. I contacted the manufacturer as to where I could take it for repair or exchange. I was told they would get back in touch with me & haven't heard back in over 3 weeks.........
5,generater,"got this so when power is out we have tv and lights dont need anything else heat with wood can cook to if have too, it fired right up on my test run if I have any problems I let you all know"
5,Great Little Generator,"Used it during Irene. It's quiet and uses little fuel. Runs smooth under load. It kept my basement dry when I lost power. For me, great buy."
4,carburetor problems,"Got the generator for lightning my power panel which I needed to replace. Worked fine the first 6 hours. Next day, fuel was running out of the carburetor. No expertise here, but took off float bowl, air cleaner cover, sprayed choke/carburetor cleaner, and applied air pressure . Still, same problem. Used flashlight and batteries to finish my panel wiring. Next day took bowl apart and noticed gas inside the plastic float. Drained float and put a thin coat of Krazy Glue around the seam where it seemed to be leaking. With a smile, put it back together, but same problem of leaking gas around the carburetor. Next day, took bowl apart, experimented with the float tang that regulates gas flow at the pin valve, and finally success. Local small engine repair folks told me they knew of nothing that would work other than a replacement float. Had used similar glue on an outboard motor lower gear housing and still working fine after several years."
2,Tony,"I purchased this generator from Amazon, and it was delivered fast. I put in the fuel and started it, after a few moments the enguine started knocking and got louder and louder the longer it ran. I came back up here to Amazon's site to arrange for a return but the site says this item is not elligable for return. I feel that when I purchased this there should have been a notice saying it is a non returnable item but I am going to contact them tomorrow and argue my point. I will keep you posted to the outcome.Well I called customer service and explained the problem and with out hesitation the rep said I will get a new one delivered next day and sent me a return autherization be email. Next day came and so did the new generator and it worked fine. Now how can you beat that kind of service. This is why I keep comming back to make my purchases throu Amazon."
1,Do not Buy,Received the generator and it would not start. No spark.Amazon first said that I could not return it due to it having gas in it.There is also a no refund policy.Amazon eventually said keep the generator and refunded my money.
5,Will power a 18.4 cu ft fridge,"I tested this generator with my fridge,19 inch TV and a light at the same time, has no problem starting the fridge, I'm ready for the next ice storm. Fast shipping from amazon at a great price, very happy."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE GENERATOR FROM AMAZON.COM,I bought 2 generators from internet shopping recently one from Amazon.com.The deal seems good to me but not when you actually received it .First one was came with broken bottom supporter.Second one came with broken fuel tank.I had tried to exchange it but failed Amazon.com says I will find customer service button on return policy page. I tried many time to look for the button I could not find.I do strongly recommand not to purchase from Amazon.com generators.It is worth to visit store near you.DO NOT PURCHASE FROM AMAZON.COMDO NOT!!!!!!!!YOU WILL BE END UP WITH HEADACHE AND MORE PROBLEM
1,100 % garbage,"This unit is a scam. Works for 1 or 2 tanks of gas, no power... needs to be restarted every 15-20 minutes.. then after 1 or 2 uses.. it will never work again... The Chinese who build this junk must laugh every time one goes on a boat to the USA. The sale of this POS should be stopped."
1,Cheep Don't Buy! Broke when I pulled picked it up to use it,"Purchased this in 2008. It has never been used, or started! I purchased in case of a power outage. Just wanted enough power to keep the gas furnace going. Picked it up by the handle yesterday to use it and the frame broke in half. The pot metal is so thin it didn't withstand it's own weight when I picked it up. Don't buy this!"
5,Love This,"I take this to my Football Giant tailgates. Its has worked beautifully for 2 years and last for hours, powering the TV. Always starts right away."
3,Worth the money,"Pros -- works well for the price. Simple with some nice features. I like the ability to drain the carb, thus allowing for simple long-term storage. Would recommend it.Cons -- Louder than I thought. However, no complaint.."
4,Good purchase so far,First one received had a broken motor mount so had to send it back. That is all right because the price had dropped to 119 with free shipping so it worked in my favor. The second one received was in perfect shape. Just put fuel in it and it fired right up. So far it runs well a power drill and an electric mower. Haven't tested it too extensively yet though. Will post more later.
3,Read this before you buy... No refund/return if it bad..,"I buy from Amazon but... Read reply email from Amazon...Customer Service""Hello,We're sorry, but due to safety reasons, we cannot accept the return of any hazardous materials--these include but are not limited to items that are flammable, gas-powered or use propane or natural gas--at any of our fulfillment centers. The risk of accident is simply too great.If the item needs to be serviced or replaced, we recommend that you work with a local authorized dealer or contact the manufacturer directly it is covered under there warranty"".****I edit the review to put star back for Amazon service.. They are good service, but still i kept the ref. email for anyone who will buy this product in future."
4,Great for basic small RV needs!,"Purchased this unit basically to keep our trailer batteries charged while camping and to run a few small appliances and the microwave. The unit came packaged well, started right up, has run flawlessly thus far, and is very small and easy to transport. We ride and race 2-stroke dirt bikes and this unit uses the same 50:1 mix ratio so we always have mixed fuel handy. The unit is very quiet, easy to start, and has good run time. Tough to beat considering the price."
4,REVIEW REVISED - JUNK,"I have had a similar experience to many of the other reviewers. No damage on receipt, but it was difficult to get it started the first time. The engine does not have one of those little primer bulbs on the carburetor to prime it with gas. As a result, the first time you put gas in it and try to start it requires a lot of tugging on the starter rope. Once I got it started, it started fairly easy after that. I tried it the next day and it started right up. UPDATE - I let it sit for a while and I have not been able to get it started again. I have tried everything and it will not start. Piece of JUNK"
1,Frustrating,"Well, there goes my money. This product is very frustrating, especially just trying to start it up. You will wear yourself out. Certainly would not recommend this product to anyone, well maybe my worst enemy."
4,Worked great for me!,"I bought this so I could have some power while camping out for a Nascar race.The generator worked great, kept our cell phones and tablets charged. Also used it to power a few fans to help keep us cool. It was great not having to rely on a vehicle's cigarette lighter for power!The only drawback I can see is that there's really no way to see how much gas you're putting in. I bought a 5-gallon jug, which was more than enough for the weekend. I just couldn't really tell how much gas to pour in, so it was hard to determine if the generator met the ""active time"" standard.Great for emergencies, but only to power a few things using relatively minor power."
3,cheap,"You get what you pay for. Not a complete waste of money but if you want a generator that's not finnicky you should spend a little bit more on another brand generator.In the first two days of owning the TG1200 the A/C outlet connector came off in the back(easy fix just had to pull apart and search for problem and reconnect). The pull start has came all the way out 3 times total(took some figuring out to get it back together the first time but in the end it works and I'm getting fast at fixing this particular problem).Just recently I went to use the DC outlet and it's not working, I haven't yet looked for the problem but it's probably another quality control issue.If you don't mind tinkering, this generator might be for you. Good luck."
4,Calming and relaxing,"In a wrap: A very nice CD.If you like such artists as Jack Johnson, Xavier Rudd, etc. then this album may really please you.Love love love, Shy That Way are excellent just sitting back in the sun or driving along songs."
4,COPY PROTECTION HINT,"Ok, I'm not a fan of copy protection either, but at least there is a way to get around it (with this cd anyway). All you have to do is put the cd in your computer and have it make a copy onto another disc (it will let you make up to three of these). Or you can download the tracks to your computer if you don't mind the wma format, although I have no idea who actually uses this format. So once you have your cdr, put that into your computer and rip it to mp3's just like any other cd. It's a bit of a hassle, but at least it works, and what do you know! now they have forced you to make a pointless cdr that you have no choice but to give to a friend! How kind of the record company to do that!"
5,"My favorite of hers, one of my favorites of all","This is my favorite CD of Tristan's and this is one of my favorite albums that I own. If you are a fan of Tristan or want to see what she is about, this is a great place to start.It is unfair for those who rated down this CD because it uses DRM (digital rights managment). You are rating down this talented artist and incredible CD just because you cant rip it the way you want to rip it. By the way, this CD DOES allow you to rip it to your MP3 player or to a CD (albeit a limited number of times). Go complain about a Metallica or Madonna CD, not an upcoming artist who needs to sell some CDs in order to continue making music. I will gladly accept some ripping limitations of this (or any) CD if it means the artist can keep making music. In these days its too easy for people to download (e.g. steal) ripped CDs, so anything to stop that so artists can keep doing what they do is fine by me."
1,COPY PROTECTION NAZIS,"The music is excellent, which is sad because the disk is copy protected and can't be moved into iTunes or an iPod without doing a bunch of stuff you shouldn't have to do. Burn a disk, read the burned disk, import licenses, copy this file and not that file, download a piece of German ripware -- If you want the music in iTunes or on an iPod, buy it from iTunes. If you think you have the right to listen to music you paid for on your player of choice, Virgin records thinks you're wrong. Their BS story about how Apple won't enter into a contract with them is just another excuse to screw us, the buyers, while they try to make even more money off the artists they force to use their distribution networks."
1,Copy protected,"This CD is copy protected. If that is of concern to you, do not purchase. On the back cover is a warning that this CD may not play in some CD players, DVD players, and computers. It also states that if it doesn't play you're screwed as you won't be issued a refund. If that is of concern to you, do not purchase."
1,WARNING,"WARNING: THIS DISC IS COPY PROTECTED!!!! Using a computer to copy it to your MP3 player requires you to install licensing software on your computer, and you may or may not be able to load the music onto your MP3 players, depending on their DRM capabilities. And you can bet money you won't be able to use anything other than an approved lossy compression format (i.e., you'll lose sound quality). Shame on Amazon for selling this disc without providing proper warnings."
4,Enjoyable,"Tristan Prettyman has a gorgeous voice. Her music is very chill, the type you can have playing in the background and just relax to. Unfortunately, a few of the songs blur together for me.My personal favorites are Shy that way and Electric which I consider to be 2 of the stronger tracks on this CD. Tristan Prettyman is definately worth a listen!"
3,Tristan Tried,"I have recently discovered the amazing voice of Tristan Prettyman by a close friend of mine who loves her. The first time I heard her voice in the song Guest Check, I was stunned. The light and ease accompany such a poweful voice which seems to linger after you've listened to the song. Another of my favorites are, When it Rains, Anything at all and Shy that Way. I was so excited to hear she was coming out with a new album called Twentythree.I bought the album and the feeling which I had the first time I listened to her was gone. As a fan, I was disappointed. Her voice didn't change, it was the songs. I wasn't thrilled to listen to them over and over again. I felt there wasn't the same kind of passion behind her voice now as so evident before. I enjoy her cd, however I am weary about purchasing the next."
1,Music is great/ Copy protection is a deal breaker,I would really have liked to buy this cd....but if you don't start taking a stand against copy protection...soon all cds will be copy protected...then it may not work on your computer or mp3 player....Send a message to the record companies....if you let them get away with it - they will.
1,Maybe I would like her if I could play the CD,"I wasted my money on this CD. I purchased it and it wont play in my car stereo. When I got home I burned it to my computer, but it doesnt want to play there either. It tells me it needs the media rights, but when it tries to download them the site it down. Basically I spent $15 for a coaster. Maybe I would have ended up liking her music and buying more of her CDs, but I dont think I can ever give this artist another chance."
2,"Rare, recently produced, poorly done SW comic.","This is a review of the Dark horse comic ISBN 1569716234 published January, 2002 Printed in Canada, story by Ron Marz, Art by Tom Fowler. I have put this book on the SW timeline at -27.1 before NH.This comic features some of the worst artwork I have seen in a star wars based comic produced in the last several years. This story features Jango, Zam and a cameo from Boba. The story is a 3 but the artwork is a 2.I buy these comics for 2 reasons. First is so I can read them with my son. The second is that Lucas licensing sometimes allows Dark Horse to make an important contribution of fact and context to the SW expanded universe. One also buys a comic for its artwork. Because this one fails based on its art, I rounded down to 2 stars."
5,Good quality,The dogs love them. I bought the beehive years ago. The bees were the first thing to go and I never replaced them until now. Glad I did!
1,Poorly made,"Although these little bees are very cute, 2 of the 3 in our package fell apart within the first 10 minutes. I bought these as Christmas gifts to give to different dogs in our family and was very embarrassed to almost immediately find the toy's stuffing on the floor. The bees both came apart at the seems, and when you see how far apart the stitches are it makes sense why. I guess that is why these are replacements for the hive toy and they are really not made to be played with separately. Overall, even though these are very cute, I was disappointed."
5,My dog loves this toy,My dog opened the package and plays with this toy several times a day for hours. It is a good quality. He normally rips toys to shreds but this is holding up fine!
5,Hours of fun,Our dog can't get enough of this toy...or toys like it. Anything that requires her to think and solve gives her hours of fun. She has several of these types of toys and it keeps us busy as well !!!
3,Need to be more durable,"I have purchased the birds, the bees, and the squirrels for my yellow lab puppy. Of the three, the bees seem to be the least durable (or maybee (pun intended) she went at them with more gusto). She destroyed them in a matter of hours. All three had the stuffing torn out and were beyond repair. We often ""fix up"" the birds and the squirrels to extend their lives. Unfortunately the bees were beyond repair. I'll be sticking to the squirrels."
2,Not durable,"My 17 lb shih tzu loves these bees but they are not well made. The seams came loose on all of them after only 2 weeks, and he is not aggressive with his toys either."
5,instant puppy love from Amazon,My breeding mill rescue loved these toys the moment he found out they squeak. The bees are small enough for him to hold in his mouth (Havanese). Be prepared to order replacements.
1,Doesn't recognize disk changes - no driver update,"This product triggers the Win7 install and appears to work on first disk, but when you remove the first disk and insert a second disk it does not recognize that a change has occurred. It continues to show the content of the first disk. Win7 reports the driver is up to date in device manager."
4,REMOVE THE BOTTOM PLATFORM,"Remove the three Philips-head screws beneath the bottom platform that hold the bottom platform to the tube and then the (Colibri) feeder looks like its picture, and larger birds that could perch on it can no longer feed from it. With the bottom platform removed, the only birds I noticed on the feeder today were goldfinches, and they ate from it voraciously throughout the day. There may be other small birds that will come to it and manage to feed from it, but the goldfinches I had rarely spotted before on the feeder were abundant today."
1,Save Your Money,I was pretty excited to find a 3 lb upside down finch feeder. I have a ton of yellow finches in my back yard and decided to upgrade from the cheapo upside down tube finch feeders to this one.The disc at the bottom of this feeder is pretty useless. It seems to be more of a bird poop collector. It also helps stabilize the feeder when filling it up.Every time I glanced out the window I found the cheapo upside down tube feeder loaded with finches. I looked at my new feeder and found it was totally empty.A few finches tried the new feeder only to give up and go to the older feeder. I compared the two feeders and found that the pegs to the new feeder were considerably thinner.I am going to try adding some tubing to the pegs to thicken them up a little. Either way; save your money on this feeder. It may look sharp; but that's about it.
2,not like the picture,The picture for this product did not show the platform bottom that the larger birds are able to stand on and feed. It makes the feeder not practical for the purpose advertised. I will probably discard this product.
2,"Good idea, poor design.","Yes, the Gold Finch's can hang upside down to feed but the vertical separation of the feed holes are to close together and this allows other birds to sit on a perch and reach the feed hole above it.I will soon be looking for a different upside down feeder as this one allows any small bird to sit on it and feed."
3,Not what I expected,Not what I expected. Not made for goldfinches. Other birds can feed standing up.Feeder great quality but if you only want goldfinches don't buy this feeder.
2,Not only for goldfinches,"The qualaity of this feeder seemed very good. But I wanted a feeder that the house finches couldn't use. They figured out they could reach a feeding port from a perch below. So they kept the smaller gold finches and pine siskins off the feeder. As a result I returned this feeder. If you don't mind the house finches eating all the food, then this would be a good feeder"
2,Black finch feeder,The feeder is all black and doesn't attract finches. We have returned to a feeder with a yellow top that is more appealing to and attracts many more gold finches.
1,Still waiting,"My local goldfinches, here in upstate NY, have shown no interest in feeding from this ""upside down"" feeder. They'd rather stand on a perch and eat from my black oil seed feeder. The Birdscapes 736 has been outside for an entire week and is still full to the top. Perhaps if I took down my other feeders, the birds would have not choice. I'm sorry I bought this feeder...but I'll keep waiting for a while before discarding it."
3,Birdscapes 736 Upside Down Goldfinch Feeder,"I've had this feeder up for about 4 weeks and it doesn't seem to draw as many Goldfinches as other feeders I've used. Maybe because it isn't as colorful? I even took other feeders down after a couple of weeks to ""drive"" them to this new feeder. I guess we'll see.It seems to be sturdy and the squirrels will have a tough time with the metal covered seed slots, but I always think they ask about the product way too soon in these review requests. Don't you think they should wait for a year and see how it holds up? Everything seems pretty nice when it's this new"
2,Goldfinch do not like this feeder,We have had many upside down bird feeders and this is the first one that the Goldfinch will not feed on. I think they are afraid of the color. Our Goldfinch just go to other feeders.
1,Significant shrinkage,"I have never owned a pair of socks that shrunk more than these socks. They reduced to a fraction of their size, and did so quickly. The wool is soft but this is not a well designed product."
2,Rapid shrink,"These socks look fine when new. However, after the first wash they shrunk to about 2/3 size and were too small-wearable but small. Not of high-quality compared to Gold Toe wool-if they are still being made."
1,Not ECCO,"I purchased this pair of socks from the belt outlet. The socks I received look very generic, have no name brand at all on the sock or packaging, and simply had a tag that said ""Windsor Collection"". On the back it says Garment Group Inc. Sure doesn't sound like ECCO to me. They are Merino, but not the same mix advertised in the description. In fact I noticed the features description and product description don't even match. An incorrect and almost assuredly inferior product that will be returned. The belt outlet should be ashamed."
2,Starts off nice,"These socks were very comfortable, and looked great.I did not experience sock shrinkage like some people....they're wool: wash on cold, air dry them.Only problem is they now have a gaping hole in both big toes,after only 6 wearings. Not durable at all.I have size 13 feet btw... maybe they will hold up better for people with small feet."
2,It's not very interesting,"I think the author of this book is over-valued. This book is not very inspiring. The emotions of the main caracters are, as always, ""not real"". The whole story is constructed from ""above"". And this way of telling a story is from my point of view to mathematical."
5,Another Great Morsi Novel,Pamela Morsi's characters are so down to earth and loveable that she could place them in any setting or time and it would be an enjoyable read. I've read most of her books and the only reason I can't say that this is the best is because I think they are all equally wonderful!
2,please fix all the errors!,"This book is a cute story, but the spelling and other errors detract from the story. I read the hardcover book years ago, so I was happy to purchase it for my kindle. However, page after page has stupid mistakes and I find it extremely annoying! Other than that, again, it is a cute story, funny in parts, and charming. I really enjoyed it."
4,Garters by Pam morsi,I love her books. There is a lot of romance and humor. I can not seem to put them down. Can't wait to read more.
3,okay,"I couldn't find the plants that I liked and wanted to know about how to grow and take care, and some plants didn't have pictures, only written description."
4,A real bone crusher,"Granite to granite equals bone crushing efficiency. You put the slightly course granite structure up against wood or marble and you'll wonder why it took you so long to realize that granite just crushes better. The 8"" size is perfect for my wife and I but my mother-in-law likes the 6"" better since the weight can be a little tricky to handle going into the sink for a quick wash.Pound as hard as you like and if it involves peppercorns the fine dust will eminate throughout the area causing many to sneeze. It's that efficient. (Never happened with the wood unit.)It looks very impressive and almost imposing depending upon the size of your counter. The inner surface is slightly polished with the exterior unpolished and looking like it was carved out of a piece of solid granite (which it was). The lip is over 1 inch thick and the little knobby grips are barely useable.I don't know how much native granite Thailand has left, so you might want to grab one while they're still available."
3,Meh,"The weight of the pestle insures that no matter what you put in the mortar it will definitely be ground to a fine powder. However the narrow handle makes it much more difficult to hang on to unless you ""choke-up up on the bat"". Which brings me to the next point; the bowl of the mortar is fairly deep which definitely helps to keep whatever is being ground from ending up all over the counter. The problem arises from the sharpish edge around the inner brim which, if you have ""choked-up"", bring it perfectly inline with you knuckles. And finally I'm not a fan of having the exterior finished with a heavy shellac while the interior is left completely raw, though the leftover rough finish inside does help with grinding to the finest degree. Worse than that there was (dog?) hair that had become embedded in the sealant before it had dried, leaving me with the hair permanently affixed. Leaving the exterior unsealed and instead mildly polished would have given a mush better and more consistent finish."
5,Very Nice!,"We grow/make medicinals from herbs and were looking for a larger mortar/pestle to use that was rough enough to grind materials (some of which are woody) well. This fits the bill to a ""T"" and we love it!"
5,Christmas in the Air,"I was very pleased to find this on CD. I could only find it on Amazon(after searching for hours at retail stores). This CD is one that captures the Christmas spirit and just makes me want to smile, it was always a Christmas tradition in my house, except we listened to the record! Once Upon a Christmas is the most moving holiday song I have ever. . .experienced. I read that it also includes Hard Candy Christmas(from Best Little Whorehouse in Texas). If that is true then the album excludes Silent Night, but it is almost worth it as Hard Candy is an excellent Dolly song.I think anyone, young and old, even those who dont appreciate country, who hears this CD will love it and immediately begin to feel full of holiday spirit. Watch for the TV special!"
2,Inferior release,"This album was a classic when issued by RCA in 1984. Sadly, today, this re-issue is missing the two great solo songs by Kenny Rogers. This is probably due to the fact that after Kenny was signed by RCA management changed and due to political issues within the company they didn't get along with Rogers. Sad, epically as this is a Christmas record. Kenny Rogers has one of the greatest voices ever. Let's have the album fully restored to it's ORIGINAL track listing and not cut and paste work that doesn't belong here for songs that should be."
2,Disappointment and deception...,"I agree with the review below. This is not at all like the LP version. I returned mine but still had to pay for the shipping. Oh well, I guess I'll have to keep listening to my old scratchy record."
3,Track Listing On CD Release Of This Album Altered!,"When I first bought this album on Vinyl LP I thought that it was the best Christmas album that I'd ever heard! However, having decided that I would like a copy of this on CD, I discover that the track listing has been altered. Missing are the two solo tracks by Kenny Rogers - ""Silent Night"" & ""The Christmas Song"". Inserted in their place is an extra solo track by Dolly Parton not featured on the original 1984 release of this album - ""Hard Candy Christmas""! I don't know if this has anything to do with a disagreement over royalties paid to these two artists regarding the CD release of this album but the two missing tracks really spoilt the pleasure I could have had by hearing this album in it's entirety on CD...."

3,Not the same as the 80's Christmas Special,The Dolly Parton/Kenny Rogers TV Christmas special was always a favorite of mine and I enjoyed MOST of the music. I knew when I ordered CD that it didn't have all the music from the special but I didn't realize it didn't include one of my favorite songs whose title I didn't remember. What's left is just OK.
2,Condition review,"The CD came in a timely manner, BUT the case was cracked on both sides and the CD was flopping in the package. Luckily, the CD can be used without scratches."
