1,unreliable,"I purchased this iron in early 2009 because of the good reviews on it. However, within 6 months(August 2009) the iron began having problems(couldnt change heat settings) and I got it replaced under warranty. In September 2010 (about 1 year later) the digital #'s for the heat setting began flashing and beeping and the iron wouldn't heat at all. It is out of warranty. I paid more for this iron than I usually spend and the quality has been much worse. Unfortunately, most of the bad reviews came out after I purchased the iron."
4,Very happy with it,My only complaint is that it seems you have to press the button for steam every time you use it. I'd rather have a switch that for steam that can stay in the 'on' position all the time.
3,Another Babywise Book,I enjoyed this book as I have the previous Babywise books. It makes a lot of good points but in my personal opinion it is a little crazy on the structure.
1,Author has no credentials,www.ezzo.infoPlease read the info here before buying any books by this author. He has no qualifications in child development to be writing anything. His books are full of medical inaccuracies. Many children have been harmed with his book's methods. The AAP has warned against them. PARENTS BEWARE!!!
3,ferret bandanna,"These bandannas are small - even on my 1 lb ferret. My 3 lb ferret looks choked wearing one of these. It is also disappointing that you are at the mercy of the manufacturer (Marshalls), as they change the pattern and color at whim, so you don't always get exactly what you order. Other than that they are made well and have a handy strip of velcro for doing them up."
2,Are we all bad shots???,"We got two sets, and with much excitement entered into the back yard for some shoot-em-up.....after about an hour or so, we realized that at the current hit rate, we would be playing for something like 2 days before anyone was eliminated. Maybe it was the sun, maybe we're just really, really bad shots, but whatever the reason, we lost interest. They seem fairly well made though, hence the high durability score, but we did only play with them once. I expect they will make someone very happy during our next yard sale."
1,WHY NOT JUST GET V2 STUFF,Ok they say it shots 350feet maybe but not acuarit the V2 stuff was so much better why did they but this well crap out the v2 was the best one out i give this toy 0 compared to the V2 stuff!!!
2,it doesn't work,why play laser tag if your gun shoots yourself. I got the set for christmas and it never worked. every other time it shot your self
1,this toy is poor,I think this toy (is bad) because you only get two gunes and two targets. I think that you need to add more guns and targets for that price. Or you could lower the price because this so called deal is not a deal at all. If someone reads this trust me these items break so easly.ps] Yes your son will like it but when it breaks he will complain like crazy. so I say you take my advice.You advisiorStephane smith
4,my review for this toy,for me this toy was very fun. But it was not that educational but it did help my hand and eye cordination. The durribility was beter than I expecded. I've had mine for three years and it seems to get more and more fun every time I play. I would play with it for hours and I still do this is one of my most played with toy and whoever els gets it I hpe they have fun with it to.
5,This is the BEST toy!,"I... love electronics, games, and fun. I purchased this item around oh, January 22, 2004, and I LOVE it!I've had the best time playing with my mom and my sister,and I now have something to do on my snowy Wisconsin weekends.You are NOT wasting your money when you by this toy. I (and my family) highly recomend this toy just because it's plain WOUNDERFUL!!!Some people may say that the handle is tilted and the beam is off, but that is simply not the case for me. This toy comes with shield protection, Mega-Blast, and great non-annoying(you can turn them off) sound effects. You can't beet this price!...P.p.s. Who cares if it's educational?"
4,Great outdoor game!,"This toy is great when in large groups, especially if you're using the team mode. The only problem I found with it is that the radar doesn't pick up that someone is going to shoot at you."
2,Buy ONLY if you have lots of friends.,"We bought this thinking we'd have lots of fun but we were wrong. Not that it's bad but we have like 3 friends, they don't own any laser tag stuff, so it was just me and my brother-in other words-NO FUN. I highly recommend this toy if you have like, 20 friends and they all own or are gonna buy a laser tag set. Otherwise, don't bother buying it, you'll only waste money. Also the team setup is a little awkward-something else to keep in mind."
2,Not that good,"The game of laser tag is the best combat simulation game on earth. It is only fun, however, if you have a large group of friends with you. The ""old-school"" vests are the best that you can get. The v-2 have the best weapons except for the exd which is favored by many of the leaders."
4,Pretty decent toy,"Got this as a birthday gift for my 9-year-old. It wasn't what he asked for but turned out to be a ""hit""...no pun intended. We all took turns and, although it isn't always accurate, it's still a lot of fun. The sounds alone are enough to get him and his ""videogame addicted"" friends up and running around for a change. It seems durable enough, and rechargeable batteries are probably a good idea. Although after a day of continuous play, the batteries are still going strong. It's a great toy for any kid that loves to act out the video games they sit and play."
2,a step backwards,"This toy is inferior to the earlier Laser Challenge V2 series. The ""radar"" feature is seriously flawed, making the guns unreliable and causing the sensor units to react erratically. Don't buy this set -- but rather find the Laser Challenge V2 set which has 350 ft. range, Max blast and blast shield, tough/reliable guns and far superior front and back sensors."
1,6th Edition Lacking,"We used this book for an MBA course and found it to have numerous errors throughout. Additionally, many of the sections are written to an audience of imbeciles, as the concepts of ""repeatability"" and ""globalization"" are explained in extreme detail. The text needs to be updated, especially the section on ERP (no longer in infancy stage). Nothing against Coach K, but the editors for this book have dropped the ball."
2,Poor Service,"24 days 4 emails, 2 missed homework assignments. That was my experience with this seller. I have purchased most of my books online, so I'm familiar with reasonable shipping times. This was my worst experience ever. Very poor communication from the seller, slow and often no response to my emails and no attempt to make up for a shipping error on his part. I'm very dissatisfied."
3,"Good content, not so well written","I think the book is pretty good as far as contents go, however, i find it a dull read. It also places too much emphasis on the service sector. I would recommend to complement it with another book such as Supply Chain Management (Lambert)."
1,Horrible service,"The book never arrived, but I was told that it was shipped. Due to this I missed completing my school work for almost a month. However, I was refunded in full."
4,Book purchase,The item arrived within an acceptable amount of time. The condition of the book was just as described.
4,Operations Management,I wish I had known this book was the international version. I was not able to use it for the class.
2,Not what I thought.,"This book pretty much tells you the story of a photographer but doesn't really tell you why he uses a specific type of lighting or what kind of lights. Most of it talks about studio size and why in his life, the photographer has done more studio than location.It's pretty much like a biography of the photographer and his studio, but a teaching book.It's not bad anyway."
2,Doesn't seem to do much,"I got this product in a [...] mystery box. On first glance it seems like it doesn't do much. The suction cup on the back is pretty good for attaching it on the bottom of your monitor (but not for a laptop). When you turn the on button the red on button lights up and a green light from the inside starts blinking (which is really annoying). Also after the second time turning it on the red power indicator doesn't work anymore. Doesn't seem to do much immediately, if you hold it really close to your nose you'll be able to smell the difference. Doesn't make any sound, definitely not worth the [...] advertised on Amazon."
5,MATCHES MY KITCHEN,I JUST NEEDED A SPOON REST TO MATCH MY NEW LEMON MERINGUE KITCHEN AND THIS WORKS PERFECTLY.
2,Over-rated,"Book has some nice pictures, but little useful explanation. Might be helpful to a beginner, in which case, I'd recommend borrowing from the library. Otherwise, move on to something else."
2,"Tennis Skills,The player's guide",Waste of money. I found nothing new in the book to improve the tennis game.Though it has a colorful sequence of amateur players and sprinkle of one shot of some professional players. The book could have been organizedwith detail suggestions. But I guess coaches do not divulge their secretsin the paper back book.
5,Incredible!,It helped me so much! I thought I was going to remain impotent all my life! I had no hope to regain my virility and this book helped me do that! I am amazed! I can only warmly recommend it now!
4,Nature Lover,"Nature loverI'm an athletic man of 40's; I love nature and any natural itemsI like to live away from crowded cities, smokes, vehicles, pollution...So I take all opportunities to put my self in a garden, or climb a mountain,Or even camping in the desert"
1,This book is a waste of money,Got this book shipped to me because I was curious. Most of the content looks like they have been compiled from the internet and it is shodilly manufactured and comes in a 3 ring binder. Not worth your money. It is a rip off
1,This book is a fraud!!!!!,"First of all, I'd like to thank Amazon! I had never imagined that my package would be delivered so fast!!!Talking about the ""book"", I can say that after opening it,the main feeling that ocurred to me was frustration. I can't consider this ""thing"" as a book. It looks like a young-boy homework... It's terrible. The printing is so bad that you think it was printed by those cheap ink jet printers... The paper of the ""book"" goes the same way. Poor, poor quality. I would forget all these problems if the contents were valuable, but it's pure nonsense! Every single word can be found on those internet penis enlargement sites... There isn't a single picture and the explanations are vague.If you take care of your money, don't be deceived. Don't buy this ""book"". Now, I think to myself how I could be so stupid on buying this garbage."
1,Read the other reviews...,"Those who gave the book the most stars wrote short, contrite, cliche` comments which, like the book, have spelling and grammatical errors. Those most critical of the book are the most articulate at explaining why they dislike it. I'm glad I was able to borrow a copy, because I certainly would have felt cheated if I paid for it, even used.I found nothing new in the book. You could read everything about the products recommended from the advertisements for them in the back of men's magazines, or hear it on the late night infomercials.Instead of this one, I would recommend:Anytime...for as Long as You Want: Strength, Genius, Libido & Erection by Integrative Sex Transmutation"
5,A must get book,"Great info on penis enlargment and other info that Doctors do not even have have an answer, all men should get a copy of this book it is a must have."
5,great,"One of the best books on erectile dysfunctions and other sexual disorders, this book helped me overcome my erection problems and have a normal sex life in no time. I was looking for relief from my condition but not even doctors worked, so i tried this instead, decided to give it a shot and it was a miracle, it worked"
5,Natural Penis Enlargement,"This wonderful book is extremely informative to general public as a whole and particularly to men over50. After experimenting with so many different variety of Penis enlargement products and books, I can honestly say that finally we have this remarkable book. I really rate this as the FIVE STAR of its category. TK, Thallahassee, Fl."
4,A wonderful example of life and love,"This book describes an experience which most of us will encounter at least once in our lifetime. An encounter with a stranger who we find irresistible and can't bear to be without.It tells the story of Mary, a happily married diplomats wife who marries the perfect guy. But through a series of encounters she finds herself drawn to Frank, a newspaper reporter from New York. As the story continues we race through the pages trying to discover will Mary give everything up for love."
2,does not live up to hype,"I must admit I am only halfway through this book, but it is such a chore after the moving experience of Birdsong. The characters remind me of the paper dolls I played with as a child. They belonged to an older cousin, and all came with 1955 era paper clothes. I know exactly what the characters in this novel are wearing: Mary's dresses and sweaters, Franks hats and shoes. But as with the paper dolls, if I am to get through this book, I am going to have to flesh them out myself, as Faulks does not seem to be able to do it for me. This is an overresearched, underwritten book, and yes, Sebastian, you've learned just what New York was like in 1959. Now give us a plot and some characters to go with it. That said, the character of Charlie has some heart, but even in Birdsong, Faulks's female characters were two-dimensional. I haven't given up on it, though. I pray for a twist ending."
1,Skip it!,"I REALLY wanted to like Shooter Jennings' music, but try as I might, I can't. It's so forgettable and tired. Hank III is so much cooler, fresher, and not to mention, better looking. And Joe Buck rocks, too! Skip this crap--even if you love Waylon as much as I do. Buy Hank III or Wayne the Train instead. Besides, what kind of outlaw drives a Cadillac Escalade?? A poser!"
5,WaylonFnJennings # 2,"Who Knew That Young Shooter Jennings Would Be The One Who Will Probably Fill His Outlaw Father's (Waylon GD Jennings) Shoes????I Did!!!! I Was Waiting On This Day To Come Ever Since The Departure Of The Best In The Business Ever Waylon Fn' Jennings.So Give This Ass-Kickin' CD A Listen And Put Country Music Back On Track.....Back To Country Music Instead Of Pop Counry~~~WhichSucks!!!!! So,Here's To Ya Shooter On Your Debute CD....Love It!Brian Michael WalkerWaylonFnJennings@aol.comWaylon Still Rules"
1,Putting the 'O' back in Offull,"Wow, this guys is nothing like his daddy. Its like really bad rock and really bad pop country went to dinner and later went home and pooped out Shooter Jennings. This is really really bad. This is as far away from outlaw country as you can get. Stay away from this album like it's the plague. If you want to here a real Outlaw country album, try some Wayne the Train or some Hank III, or go back to the classics, and get some old George Jones, Lefty Frizzell, Dave Dudley, Del Reeves, Hank Sr, Ernest Tubb. But stay away from this. When You can play Shooter on a station that you can also play Celine Dion & Justin Timberlake on, you know its pure crap. I would rate it a 0 star if I could"
1,Very bad and very dissapointing,"I was hoping for a whole lot more. Very bad, not recomended. I don't care who your daddy is, crappy music is crappy music.Save your time and money and go buy a Hank Williams SR, JR or, more importantly, III album (February 28th H Williams III album comes out, Straight To Hell, much recomended by me).Shooter tries and fails to be a Southern Rock Outlaw tough buy. It just doesn't work. More of a name dropper sell out!"
4,"Don't delay, act now!!!!","This guy is a credit to his family name, AND THAT'S SAYING ALOT!!I actually was close to giving this 5 stars but I am so hesitate in doing that. Shooter's voice is unlike his fathers but you can still hear that outlaw heritage coming through...and STRONG.Don't get me wrong there are 1 or 2 songs that lack something in this C.D., but with that said, there are 9 gems and 3 others that are lacking but somehow make you sing along with them. (My math does add up because there is a hidden song). The strongest tracks are ""4th of July"", ""Manifesto 1"", and ""Pure Country Gold"". This is another son of a Outlaw who shines, along with Hank 3. Do yourself a favor and buy this new relic."
5,Shooter put's the O back alright!,"I reccomend this album for anybody who likes a lot of classic and ""outlaw"" country and Southern Rock. This is like Lynyrd Skynyrd meets Waylon Jennings, though you can only tell a hint of his Daddy's influence. This whole album is good. But IF I had to choose just a few songs that are ""highlights"" I'd have to go with...""4th of July,"" ""Lonesome Blues,"" ""Sweet Savanah,"" ""Solid Country Gold,"" and ""Southern Comfort."""
4,Shooter Jennings,"I am enjoying the music from this CD. I listen to it often, and it is one that I carry from the car to my home or work. I wouldn't have known about this artist if I had not seen him in the movie, ""Walk The Line"""
1,If not for '4th of July' it would not be worth 1 star,"CMT's play of '4th of July' really had me exited about this album. I bought this album with reasonable expectations as it is a debut album, but I was not prepared at all for the absolutly horrible album. The writing is subpar, there are no catchy hooks (except for the aforementioned '4th'. The 'outlaw' factor seems very contrived and is just not believable. I loved Waylon's music and what he stood for, but the reason we remember him is because his music was different and not in the mold. Shooter is trying to fit and 'outlaw mold' and the result is just plain bad."
1,CRAPY POP COUNTRY,"This cd is horrible. Please don't buy it. The music is very average Nashville garbage. It sounds no different than the crap you will hear on country radio. How can Shooter say that he is trying to ""put the O back in country"" and tour with Toby Keith? If you want to hear real country please check out Hank III's Lovesick, Broke and Driftin."
1,crap stay away from this album!!,Shooter Ain't a pimple on his Daddys ass. This Album sucks. Crappy songs crappy music. I love the outlaws and I am a huge Ragweed fan but its just another case of a guy treading around in music on his fathers name and reputation. I have a question Shooter what ever happened to Stargunn at least you could sing that kind of hard rock without any one realizing what a hack you are. universal south should be shut down just for putting out this gigantic failure.
3,Put the Lame back into country,Wow another kid with zero talent. He must be related to Brittany Spears! The only reason Shooter wasnt shot down by the record execs is because he obviously has pull from being the son of someone with talent. A lousy album indeed!
3,Decent,"Though I've read this album was recorded after Electric Rodeo, it isn't nearly as good. Every song on Electric Rodeo is solid, while this one only has its moments. If you owned Electric Rodeo first and think you need to have this one as well, you don't. But ""Daddy's Farm"" is a good one."
5,Shooter deserves more radio play,"This album is a great introduction to Shooter. If you do not have to be force fed your country music from the radio, you will love this album."
2,Doesn't soak up water.,"This mop head didn't ""mop"" up the water on the floor at all. For the price, I would definitely not recommend purchasing."
2,oh dear!!truly corny!!,"back in the 80's here in england before video censorship this was one of the ""video nasties"" i didn't get to see:still banned in the u.k and i have to ask ""why?""!!!some average acting,weak on the story dept(were you expecting one though?),and distinctly lacking in the horror dept:by todays standards the gore factor is low,hey!if you like blood,guts and horror watch private ryan,we were soldiers,band of brothers.this film,like a lot of these type of films,is only interesting if you want to re-live your youth,and catch up with what scared you way back when!!!"
4,Apocalypse? Well...,"Ok, I must admit that I was a bit let down by this movie. I mean, with a title like CANNIBAL APOCALYPSE, I was expecting an all-out war between the flesh-eating hordes and their prey. Instead, we get a few hungry folks chomping on a few necks. John Saxon (A Nightmare On Elm Street, Black Christmas) is good enough as the Vietnam vet, plagued by flashbacks / nightmares about his anthropophagic military cohorts. The idea of a viral cannibalism, spreading like rabies (sort of like in Cronenberg's movie, Rabid) is creepy. I just wanted the promised apocalypse! Oh well, I did like the story, and will watch it again, now that I know what to expect..."
2,AKA Invasion of the Flesh Eaters,"This is one of those films that has only been available in much edited form and listed under 20 different titles. The features on this DVD alone make it worth buying, but the film isn't half bad either. It's a zombie/cannibal film that follows your typical outbreak scenario. Saxon is good as usual. There is an infamous sewer splatter sequence that is supposed to MAKE the film, but was sadly cut from all previous Amercian releases. This is kind of a take on DOTD, but don't expect much. If you're looking for a sleazy Italian horror production than you won't be disappointed."
4,A feast for lovers of Gourmet Magazine,The best of writing from the Gourmet Magazine of the 60's and 70's. Writing from the Goumet we know and love.
4,Nice change from bar soap; handy in the locker room,"My wife picked this up for me after I complained about my bar soap turning to mush. I don't have a lot of experience using shower scrubs, so my expectations were low.I was looking for something handy to take along on business trips and use in the locker rooms. The AXE shower scrub was good on both counts.I use the shower scrub along with theSalux Nylon Japanese Beauty Skin Bath Wash Cloth/Towel(see my Amazon review), so it is difficult for me to know how much additional scrubbing power AXE provides. Anyway, the smell is faintly citrus and not overpowering. I get a good lather, drizzling a bit on the nylon towel. And my wife says I smell good.What more do I need?"
1,Toxic Ingredients,"This product is made from toxic chemicals which are absorbed by the skin and are linked to neurotoxicity, immunotoxicity, and bioaccumulation. [...]Consider some type of natural hemp soap."
4,Favorite of the AXE soaps!,I have tried most of the AXE shower scrubs but I like the snake peel because it has some kind of gritty substance in it that really scrubs away any grease. It works almost as well as Lava soap for removing grease. The smell is really appealing to women but not overbearing. Most of the time my girlfriend will just say I smell good without really knowing why. The only thing I don't like about the soap is the packaging won't sit upside down and you can't get the last 10% out by just squeezing it. I have to balance the bottle onto something upside down to get the last little bit out. If the changed the bottle I would give it 5 stars.
3,Snake Peel + Desert Minerals = Meh,"This shower gel has a slightly-citrus tang and foams up well in normal water, which means it'll last you a while since not much is needed for one use. I'm not sure what the ""snake peel"" (or, even more interesting, the ""desert minerals"") are intended to be, but they seem to clean very well, and they did so without drying my skin. This gel comes with blue, exfoliating micro-beads, but there are so few of them that their effect appears to be negligible, as is the after-scent of this so-so shower scrub."
2,Itchy,This stuff left my skin so dry and if you don't rinse off really well the beads stick and dry out in your body hair. I have since switched to Axe shock body wash and it does wonders for me.
1,"Even at 5 bucks, not worth it!","Okay, this book is really quite worthless. First, it is romanized. This is a terrible way to learn a non-roman script language. Second, my biggest complaint, it is out-dated. Since the book is from the 50's, yes, the 1950's, the younger generation in Korea can't understand you. Thirdly, the book does not teach all three levels of speech. Okay, there are other books out there. Don't buy this one... ."
2,25% Substance 75% Repetition,"There was so much more to Babe's life than this documentary shows..There is next to nothing about his relationship to Lou Gehrig, Miller Huggins, his wives, Father Tobias (spelling may be off) who changed his life,,his barnstorming trips where his All Star teams played against some of the great black players of those days like Stachel Paige...The first 20 minutes consist of a verbal tribute from some very old gentlemen...it was tribute..homerun..tribute..homerun..tribute..homerun etc..that went on and on...we didn't have to be told over and over that he was a great player...About one fourth of the film is VERY interesting...but generally a real disappointment"
5,Excellent Babe Ruth documentary,This is a great Babe Ruth documentary! I bought it as a gift for my boyfriend and he loved it! He watched it twice in 2 days. It really does a great job of explaining and illustrating the life of Babe Ruth. Has lots of photos and video clips and stories from Babe's friends. Good narration too!
3,History,another addition to my history collection. I enjoy know more about some of our great atheletes. This is a keeper.
5,this is a must have for nba fans,"this game has everything you can ask for in a basketball game and then some. you can play season, exhibition or go straight to the playoffs if you can't wait to get that trophy. the players in this game move fluidly and the control is deadly accurate. expect to hear great music in this game. i especially like the intro music. it really pumps you up for the action. as for options you can create and edit players and trade any player in the league. in this game you can also unlock players of the past such as wilt chamberlain, julius erving, michael jordan, larry bird, magic johnson and many more including rookies of the 1994-95 season. this basketball game is about as complete as a basketball game that the snes has to offer. you must get this game if you have a super nintendo like me. this system rocks after more than a decade and i still think it is the best game system ever made."
5,Everything a new teacher needs to know,"All new English teachers should read this. Christenbury gives helpful advice, anecdotes, and ideas on simply every aspect of the English Language Arts classroom. It is easy to read and very enjoyable. I am so thankful my English methods professor assigned this book. I have sticky-noted it up and plan on re-reading again when I get my first teaching job!"
2,snoozzzeee,"Easy to read. Might be helpful for someone who has never taught before. I found nothing new. As in the case of most education books, she takes 50 pages to say what could be communicated in 5."
4,As good as we've got so far,"I also owned the VHS prior to owning the DVD, but I must say the DVD is definately an improvement, especially with the audio. I thought the picture was fine as well, I dont know what that other guy was complaining about. The performance is great, although I thought Noel's guitar tone was a little thin, and there are clips of interviews thrown in between songs which gets really annoying but this is still a great video and essential for all Oasis fans, although it's not quite as cool as the now out of print ""Live By The Sea."" I think that needs to be released on DVD."
5,Simply amazing.,This DVD is one of the greatest things I have ever seen. It shows one of the greatest rock bands ever at the best form of their careers. Most of the songs in these performances are the best versions of the songs ever recorded.
4,Definitely not the best picture,"Did anyone else notice that the picture is VERY blocky? It gets real bad in the red light, but it's still better than anything VHS has to offer. Well, the sound is pretty good with some interesting surround effects. It's really nice to have most of my favorites live on video with random access. A must have for all Oasis fans."
4,"soul searching, super sappy, satisfying novel!!!!","The book ""Girlhearts"" by Norma Fox Mazer is a great book. When Sarabeth's mom dies of a sudden heart attack at 29, Sarabeth must live with her mom's friend. Uncomfortable and unwelcomed, Sarabeth has to do some soul searching to find out where in life she really belongs!"
3,Keep some kleenex handy.,"Sequel to Silver.Sarabeth Silver lives in a trailer with her slightly off-the-wall mom and her cat. Sarabeth's dad died in an accident when she was very young. When her mother dies suddenly of a heart attack at only 30 years old, Sarabeth's life is thrown into turmoil. She has to move into a tiny apartment with her mother's best friend and her cat is taken in by another family. Sarabeth struggles to be grateful to the people who step in to help her (even though none of them will really listen to her), but she becomes depressed and angry as she deals with her mother's death.Her friends, old and new, support her and try to help her heal. They inspire her to make contact with her long-lost relatives and to find out more about her parents' families (who disowned them when Sarabeth's mother became pregnant at 16 years old)."
1,A beginners book for a professional camera,"I expected a BOOK... for 34 dollars, and in color not a photo copy with Black and White pictures. I wanted to know details of the D100 camera not the basic's. Not worth the money at all. Sorry... better information for free on the Web!"
1,Cheapest book I every paid too much for,"One of the cheapest production. This book is a total rip off. For the amount one pays, one would expect a properly bound color copy of the book. This is a cheap reproduction(B/W Photocopied)with cheap sprial bounding. There is no way to to pick up any photography color information since it's in black and white. I whould estimate that the copying of this book cost about $3 max."
1,Read the description carefully before you buy!!,"I just received this book, and while I haven't read the printed material yet to judge its value, the mere fact that it is printed TOTALLY in black and white including the example pictures, makes it only worth about 1/3 of the 34 dollars (plus shipping) that it costs!! While the accompanying cd does include a full color version of the book which I originally expected to be the print version, now if I want a color, printed copy, I will have to take the cd to a printer and probably pay another 35 or 40 bucks to have it printed. It does state in the description of the book that it is printed in black and white and I foolishly didn't read that far down before I bought it. So buyers, read the description carefully and be aware that the printed copy you will receive is in BLACK AND WHITE. The author should have offered the book at a much lower price than this when he purposely printed it this way."
4,Surprisingly good,"I was surprised how much I would love this story. I did like the fact especially that there are 4 guys (one is a villain) vying for her interest. The obstacles that the couple had to face worked nicely into this well written story. It had me hooked from page 1 to the end. I didn't feel the need to skip many pages.One thing I do have to mention for those who hate extra sexual relations after meeting the heroine... he does go and have sexual relations with this one woman in the beginning, but the love story that comes after is a worth it. You won't be disappointed if your taste in romance is like mine"
4,a short review of the book theory of functions by Knopp,"Despite not being a very recent book, a graduate student of mathematics who has to prepare complex analysis as a general topic for his qualifying examinations may find that this text covers all the essential material in the subject."
1,Item Was damaged,Look like this Item was used box really bang up n the item was bent on the base. Not what I expected.
2,Poor user experience using dimmer,"While the dimmer worked and was inexpensive, it's really not convenient to use and just seems cheap. There's no tactile feedback as it's not a mechanical switch, just a touch plate. Normal people just don't understand how to use it and having to train people to use a dimmer is silly. I replaced it with a Smarthome 2476D which is much more expensive, but works a lot better (it also has way more features if you care about that)."
4,Excellent value,"It would been good to know that the item sent is not the same as item pictured. Although, the item is a good value and works well, I was shopping for a match to an item previously purchased."
3,"Some useful information but mostly dull, boring, and what's another word to use for the same word?","This book was recommended by an Olympic shooter. He warned me it would be pages and pages of boredom with intermittent passages of very useful information followed by some interesting mathematical formulas at the end. He was correct. I read it once, am glad I did, but will never read this again - ever."
5,"Genesis, the Movie","Robert Farrar Capon is one very DEEP man with some of the most insightful, inspiring and incredibly challenging observations on the Scriptures of any teacher or writer I've ever come upon. His books are meant to be ""eaten"" slowly for they are full and rich and nourishing to the soul and mind of searching, thoughtful Christians. My Bible Study group of 8 women have feasted many days on his words. This book is no exception in our journey with Capon.This is my second Capon book to read/eat."
2,Poor sound,"I had seen ""New Waterford Girl"" on cable some time ago and wanted a copy to share with others. The production values for the copy I recieved were much different than that of the cable version. The specific issue was the sound quality...background music overrides the dialogue in many critical areas...sounds as if the sound editor thought the movie was only about the music."
5,Not just for teenagers,"I was a bit hesitant in picking up Balance of Trade, because it looked from the jacket like it was intended as a ""young adult"" novel, and (no longer qualifying for that designation) I was concerned that it would be a bit simplistic for my tastes. I need not have worried. It falls into the great SF tradition of novels that do not sacrifice emotional depth or plot complexity merely because the hero is not yet full-grown. While the book does indeed qualify as a ""coming of age"" novel, it is not written simplisticly, nor is the young protagonist portrayed as a fool--he knows how much he doesn't know, and when he makes mistakes, he does so intelligently. The story is enriched by a number of mysteries, only some of which are resolved by the end. I am hoping that this is not stand-alone, and that there will be follow-up novels in this series"
4,a page turner...,"I just finished reading this one for the second time. The first time was a while back, so I hadn't been expecting to have it be a page-turner that left me reading till way late, but it did. I enjoyed the book, and I sure hope the authors will give more glimpses of what-happened-next in their future works."
3,A good read for the slightly younger set,"A good story for the teen set, maybe 15, 16, Not up to the authors usual high standards, but if they were aiming for the teen set, it would be be good for that group. Some long stretches in the book where a yawn starts to set in, definitely set up for a sequel to happen, I don't usually like that kind of pacing,seems like they mean to make you buy another book just to get the ending of this one."
2,Balance of Trade,"I am a big fan of this series, (the Liaden Universe), but found the plot of this new book, which I waited for and bought in hardback, very thin indeed. I kept checking the cover to see if it was really by my favorite authors. I thought the plot was slow and simple, and without any real dynamic thrust. It had almost no tension to speak of, and although the characters were likeable, a novel really does require more than that. I was terribly disappointed and wondered what the authors were thinking when they cranked out this manuscript, or if their editors had any ideas other than just getting another book on the shelf. I hope the next book can develop some serious complexity which I really missed from this perhaps hastily written one."
1,Inaccurate and outdated,"This book's lodging listings are so inaccurate as to be a serious potential inconvenience for the traveler. Two thirds of the non-chain lodging listings I contacted no longer admit dogs. If it's too much trouble to update the thing, the publishers ought to stop printing it. Save your money."
3,Inaccurate on Northern Arizona,"I share my home in Northern Arizona with two dogs and travel all over the state to hike with them. I found this book helpful for Southeastern Arizona and especially for the Phoenix area, but have found numerous inaccuracies for hikes with dogs in Northern Arizona. Basically, the author lists hikes ""near"" a town and I've found them to be as far as two HOURS away from the town listed. Her directions are often way off, too. I question whether she's ever been to many of the places she lists in her book. The book is probably still worth getting, however, if all you care about is hiking/staying in and around Phoenix."
1,Pretty Old Material,"I ordered this before summer and tried to use it. It's 4 years old and most accommodations are wrong. A lot of the other info was still valid, but without a place to stay it didn't go very well."
4,PlayFoam,"This was fun for the kids, although they tired of it quickly. No bad scent, sticks pretty good - stays together enough to hold a shape, although I wish it were a bit stickier. Not messy."
2,Not practical at all,"I bought this for my son since I am not a big fan of Playdough (it sticks to everything). Granted the playfoam doesn't stick to other surfaces like playdough, it isn't as pliable either. It doesn't sculpt as easily as they say it does. I will not purchase again."
4,Good clean fun!,This stuff is great! My kids (2 & 5) had so much fun playing with the different colors. It didn't stick to or stain my furniture or carpet. It also doesn't dry out. Very easy clean up. Unfortunately my kids mixed all of the colors the first day and now we just have a giant multicolored ball of the stuff. They still like to play with it.
5,Awesome,"This foam is like the styrofoam packagings but in little balls. They give a pretty nice amount in each color. I am amazed how it won't dry out or stick to anything I put it on. It feels sticky when molding it, but they only stick to each other. This is a great toy!"
4,"Fun to mush, but difficult to mold","Let me begin by saying this stuff is fun. It is a great tactile experience, and even as an adult, I can't resist mushing the stuff in my hands. It is virtually mess free, has only the faint smell of styrofoam, and does not dry out. Also, when kids mix the colors together, which is inevitable, it creates a pleasant rainbow of colors, rather than an icky, muddy color. My only complaint, therefore, is in the area of moldability. Although it is very pliable, it is difficult to create quality structures. It is similar to trying to create a work of art with marshmallow rice crispies. Therefore, I wouldn't recommend this for the budding sculptor--However, for toddlers and preschoolers, it is tons of low-maintenance fun."
3,"Better than Play Doh, kind of","This does everything the decription claims -- doesn't stick to clothing or skin, doesn't dry out, can be used over and over. HOWEVER, no four year old that I know was able to resist the temptation to mush all the beads together, creating a rainbow blob out of every color in the box. There is no way to separate it, and just like Play Doh, once you mix the colors, it's no longer as much fun because you cannot make shapes out of different colors. This is basically what my two youngsters did upon my opening the box for them. The foam is very interesting in that it molds easily, is fun to work with and can be shaped into just about anything. Kids will enjoy this and you won't have a sticky mess after play time is over. I'd only recommend it for children over 5 or 6 because they won't be as tempted to clumpt the 6 colors together."
2,Sticky and not much fun...,I let my toddlers play with it in their high chairs. Neither of my twins enjoyed it much. And now both trays have sticky residue. Play-Doh is much better.
4,Unique sculpting medium for kids.,"Got this for our 5 year old who loves playdough. Shes not played with it as much as I thought she would. You can sculpt larger objects with it. You want to keep it to a table as its a bit messy.Nancy RectorAuthor of ""A Painful Truth - The Entrapment of America's Sick""(How Being Ill Got Me Arrested)[...]"
3,playfoam review,"I got the playfoam because my son's Preschool had it and he seemed to enjoy playing with it there. And his teacher encouraged play time with it as well as playdough to strengthen his finger muscles to get him ready to start learning how to write. So I ordered this set because it has the variety of colors and it was affordable overall. But unlike playdough it doesn't come with anything to put it in after you open it so I had to get ziplock bags and than another larger ziplock bag (freezer bag) to keep them all in. And for a four year old, I think it will be easy for him to mix up all the colors quickly because of that.It's too much. It hasn't happened yet, but than again we just got it. And I don't really get what you do with it really, other than squish it in your hands. Again, unlike playdough it comes with no accesories. I got my son a playdough set with 4 colors of playdough and molds, scissors, a spaghetti maker thing, and so on and that was the same price at walmart."
5,Huge hit!,"After seeing my younger son playing with this at his preschool I decided to get some for both my kids to play with over the summer as an alternative to playdoh. As the other reviews mention, it is really cool how it sticks together but isn't sticky. We had a bunch of the neighborhood kids over recently in a babysitting exchange and had planned for pizza and movies but all everyone wanted to do was play with this floam! Each kid a had a different color and they literally played with it for hours - both boys and girls. In the end the colors were kind of mixed up but they don't seem to care. My kids are still wanting to play with it every day. Also it was inevitable that some of those little floam balls would find their way onto the carpet but they just vacuumed up with no problem.Overall I am really impressed with this product and I would recommend it unreservedly."
3,Tactile Treat,"When it comes to fine motor skills as a teacher and a mother, I have to say that clay or Play-Doh are really hard to beat. However, this adds a new texture for preschool children. It feels sticky, but not so sticky you can't get it off anything and the foam beads let young children feel something besides smooth. Older children may be frustrated if they are artists who like smooth perfection to their shapes, but to simply mush around into large shapes, it's fine. My three year old likes to make ice cream cones and snails. Beforehand,I'd certainly clean the floor and table where your child is working, it can collect dirt and hair very easily."
4,Fun Toy,"I bought this for my neighbor son's birthday. Kids loved it, played with it for hours. Definitely will buy it again."
3,Good bedtime book,"I found this to be an excellent night-time companion, perfect for curling up under the covers and reading for 5-10 minutes. I say this because each story is about 4-5 pages, with few exceptions, and most are interesting enough to keep your attention.There are 62 stories in all, with a mix of familiar and new tales. Some of the people you've likely heard about are Jack the Ripper, the man/figure on the Shroud of Turin, Nostradamus, Robin Hood, and several more; but you will also read about many people who will be new to you. Some of them were downright creepy and weird, like ""Alice"" in the mirror and the Green Children, though others didn't seem all that mysterious (Hannah Brade). Still, this was decent reading. A good book for a quick story or two right before bed!Three stars."
1,Went into the trash bin for its extremely strong fragrance,"I like other Rusk products, so gave this hairspray a try. While it does what a hairspray needs to do, its fragrance is so strong that it followed me around all day. It lingered even after I washed my hair. For those of us who want to be relatively fragrance-free, this is unacceptable (we have a no-fragrance policy at work, so I couldn't use this on workdays even if I wanted to). Sorry, but this one ends up in the landfill."
4,"Great game, but short","Fans of the movie should enjoy this game. It puts you in the movie, participating in many of the famous scenes from a background perspective. If you ever wondered how they got the horse's head in the guys bed, this game offers a solution.My only disappointment is that it was relatively short, only took about three days to finish and was somewhat easy once you learn a few tricks (like let the guys come to you instead of rushing a bunch of guys)."
2,VERY short game,The mob wars half of this game is very easy to beat and the overall game can be beat in less than 24 hours.
2,Not their best effort...,"Most of the music on this DVD is uninspired and forgettable; my children absolutley love the Wiggles but walk away from the television shortly after the first song ""Monkey Man"", which is probably the only song that isn't a throw-away on this whole disc (aside from some of the bonus content, which can be found on other, better DVDs). Come to think of it, the only reason you might want to purchase this DVD is to make it easier to peel your children away from the TV after watching one of the better Wiggles DVDs."
5,Great Wiggles DVD-- my son loves it!,"My 8 month old has had some health issue which have made him a very high needs baby, sometimes crying for 8 hours a day. When he was 4 months old we discovered that he *loves* the Wiggles. Needless to say this was a God-send. The Wiggles have sometimes been the only thing that would calm my son down and have helped us keep our sanity. We discovered that not all Wiggles DVD's are equal, this along with You Make Me Feel Like Dancing, are the two he will watch endlessly. He loses interest in others we have tried, but this one is really fun and has a lot of variety. His favorite songs are Monkey Man, Tazzy Devil, and Jazz Cats and favorite characters are Anthony, Sam, and Captain Feathersword (the sillier he is the more my son smiles). Some commentators said they didn't like the computer background on this and YMMFLD but I think my son likes it better than the live or set DVD's because it's brighter and more varied. Definitely one of the best Wiggles DVD's!!"
2,I expected better from the wiggles,We love the wiggles. But this one is a disappointment. It's like they knew it was bad and brought Kylie to make it exciting. It's so boring and uninteresting to toddlers. I would have hated it if it was made by others. We are trying to like it just for the wiggles. My best one ever is definetly pop go the wiggles. There are better DVDs for them. Don't waste your money.
5,Best Wiggles DVD yet!,The songs on this DVD are great. Very catchy tunes and very visually interesting. This is my favorite of all the many Wiggles DVDs we have. Get it!
2,Very Disappointing For A Wiggles DVD,"The Wiggles are by far the most entertaining kids act in circulation today. Forget Barney, In The Night Garden, and the others - the Wiggles entertain both kids and parents. Unfortunately, this DVD is a letdown. Aside from the brilliant Monkey Man with Kylie Minogue, the rest of the DVD is just not as entertaining as the other DVDs. It's not as lively, and the songs aren't as well known, so my son loses interest fairly quickly. I'd recommend skipping this DVD and going with some of their more recent DVDs (I'd recommend the Sam ones over Greg, but that is just a personal preference)."
5,Granddaughter loves it,"The Wiggles are new to my 2 yr old granddaughter. Now she can't get enough of them.Every day she asks me to turn on the Wiggles.She loves dancing to most of the songs, especially the monkey dance. We also enjoy watching the live animalsthat they show before some songs. Since the Wiggles are new to us, I am enjoying watching andhearing the tunes and love to listen to especially Sam & Anthony. They are all very importantto the group, and the group wouldn't be the same if one was missing. I highly recommend thisDVD to any one that has a child the loves music. I also think that parents & grandparents mightenjoy these as well. It's good to have something that everyone can enjoy."
3,Not as good as other Wiggles,"I ordered this DVD in the hopes that my 2 yr. old would watch it like he did previous Wiggles DVDs. Instead he still insists on Sing A Song Of Wiggles (DVD), Pop Goes The Wiggles (DVD), and You Make Me Feel Like Dancing (DVD). These are very good and he would highly recommend them over Go Banannas and I agree."
4,good video,My kids love the Wiggles and this is one of the best. It was very cute and we are so unhappy that they stopped touring.
3,My 3 year old loves it. I don't.,"I love the Wiggles, but this DVD is so different from the past ones. It is annoying to me, but my 3 year old son loves it."
4,Watch it more than once!,"The first time we watched this DVD, my daughter was a bit overwhelmed. The first song is with a guest singer and The Wiggles are all dressed up so she couldn't quite pick out who they were. Now that we have seen it several more times, she actually dances to it. She even has a few favorites already. We are fans of the ""new"" Wiggles and like the costumes and computer backgrounds. These are mostly original songs so unlike the nursery rhyme DVDs these songs are a little sillier."
5,The Best Lithuanian Cookbook yet!,"I've had this cookbook since 1982, soon after I started my own family so its become somewhat of a family heirloom. I was looking to buy another one to give my eldest daughter who has also started her own little family.This is the best Lithuanian cookbook I've seen yet. It has so many of the popular lithuanian dishes I grew up with. Each recipe has its own Lithuanian heading, which is important if you're looking for a particular dish. I found that out after I bought another lithuanian cookbook that didn't have the proper lithuanian recipe names."
4,ANOTHER CLASSIC SERIAL,"THIS TIME AROUND, FLASH GORDON, DALE ARDEN, AND PROFESSOR ZARKOFF TRAVEL TO MARS TO PREVENT QUEEN AZURA FROM STEALING THE EARTH'S NITROGEN. ALSO, THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH EMPORER MING AGAIN. THIS 13-CHAPTER SEQUEL DOESN'T COMPARE WITH THE 1ST, BUT IT'S EASILY ONE OF THE BEST SERIALS EVER RELEASED. ANY SERIAL FAN WILL LOVE THIS ACTON-PACKED SERIAL."
3,"""Flash Gordon""","If you enjoyed the cheezy, corny ""Flash Gordon"" serials at the theater or on TV, here is one of three starring college educated, Olympian Buster Crabbe. If you were never exposed to them, you might not appreciate the nostalgia. The highlight of these 15 episodes are the Clay People, who come off the walls of a cave. Charles Middleton is back as the evil, monotonic Emperor Ming the Merciless, although he died in the previous serial, ""Space Soldiers."" Go ahead and laugh at the raunchiness of the sputtering space ships and the crude special effects. The worse the episodes get, the better they are."
2,Get that and skip this.,"Note that the below reviews of this disc are for the complete, 15-chapter serial FLASH GORDON'S TRIP TO MARS. This disc, however, is an edited ""feature"" version and is a poor replacement for the full serial, available from Image Entertainment (along with the other two FLASH GORDON serials) in a beautifully restored edition. Get that and skip this."
2,Interesting But Not Factual,"Walker presents a version of tarot's history that just can't stand up to much honest scrutiny. According to her, the tarot is the key to a pre-patriarchal triple goddess religion that swept eastward from India into Europe.There's no compelling historical evidence that this is the case. No one is disputing Ms. Walker's right to believe in a goddess-centered religion, but she should not present her personal beliefs forward as if they were historical FACT."
4,Understated quality item,"This is a nice toating set. Not for the elegant wedding, however very nice for most others. An understated yet appealing look from these good quality glasses. Made from silver plated Zinc in China according to the lable. Would have been 5 stars if made in America."
1,It can cause a lot of distress for you if you are consideri,"The author will scare you to death if you read her section on LASIK surgery. She has no first-hand knowledge of the LASIK procedure, and her account of what can go wrong is terrifying. I was going to have the procedure done, and after I read her book, I cancelled my plane reservations to Texas. I was panicked! Luckily, friends talked me into reconsidering, and I ended up having the procedure. I went from 20/400 to 20/15, better than perfect! This book really traumatized me. Do not read it if you want to have perfect eyesight! This is a book filled with unnecessary scare tactics!"
2,Extremely out of date in 2008/2009,"This book was copyright 1998. It covers Lasek/PRK treatements only - which are the minority treatment method in 2000 and beyond. The book does not address Lasik, nor laser flap creation (which is now done via microkeratome or laser).Good reference if you're having PRK. Otherwise, check out ""Lasik: The Eye Laser Miracle."" It does not address flap creation via laser but, otherwise, is an outstanding reference manual - covering both Lasek (PRK) and Lasik procedures."
4,How to SEE clearly through all the hype.,"One of the mandatory books one should read in their research BEFORE they visit the doctor. Without Scaring people off -Please don't assume the doctor knows what's best for YOU. Research! I read one of the two versions of this book before I had PRK and found it to be quite helpful in explaining all the technical information, but from a layman's point of view. In my research, I was very surprised at how certain physician's actually push particular procedures on patients. Investigate what's good for you, NOT the physician!"
4,The author had the procedure done on herself!!!,"Ms. Amstrong does a superb job to describe her experience with LASER VISION CORRECTION.. as she had it done to herself. This is what every patient wants to know. Edited with the help of Dr. Salz, a recognized leader in refractive surgery from UCLA, he serves as the excellent complement to the main author. Being an ophthalmologist and LASER VISION CORRECTION specialist myself (New York City), who trained at Harvard Medical School and publishes articles on the subject in all major eye journals, as well as performs all forms of LASER Vision Correction and LASIK, I found this book to be an excellent resource that no patient who is considering the procedure should be without! Furthermore, there is an accompanying video (PBS Special) that can also be purchased along with the book that is also excellent."
5,Writing the Wave: A Journey Worth Taking,"I found Writing the Wave to be an extremely helpful book, one that I think would be helpful for writers at any stage of their writing lives. It is filled with interesting, fun, easy exercises that can break through even the worst writer's block. It is an inspirational book, too. Very highly recommended!"
3,Recommended for beginners,"As with any book on writing, whether it works for you depends on your skill level, experience, and what you're looking for. Personally, I found the exercises interesting but a little too vague and disconnected in terms of purpose -- all in all, this would be a perfect book for a beginning writer who wants to write but doesn't know where or how to start. For me, the most helpful section was the chapter on jump-starting a stalled work in progress, but even so I didn't find it worth the book's purchase price."
4,Journey to the River Sea,The book came quickly and in excellent condition. My daughter and I enjoyed reading the story.
2,Well...,"when I first heard about this book, I was expecting some kind of unputdownable story. Considering the awards it's gotten, well, it's hard not to.To some of you, this story provided just that. But for me . . . well, let's just say I don't share the view of the judges. Most certainly I managed to finish the book (it wasn't quite THAT bad, though I nearly put it down). And, I admit, it was kind of heart-warming, but it didn't make up for its lake of interesting plot.If you want something interesting, I recommend Artemis Fowl for kids and the Black Jewels Trilogy for adults (trust me, I might only be 11, but I LOVED it!)."
1,I'm disgraced,"Well, first of all I am disappointed to say that this book totally and endefiantly stunk! 298 pages of complete boredom is what clogs up this book. I've read all Eva Ibbotson's books and I feel bad that she worked so hard on this garbage. Please din't buy this book! It's horrid! If you're looking for a real good read pick of Which Witch, The Secret of Platfrom 13, Island of the Aunts or Dial-A-Ghost. They're all excellent. But I'm begging you please don't waste your time reading this book like I did. You'll regret it."
4,The Best Of Eva Ibbotson,This is by far the best book I have read Eva Ibbotson. It's about a young girl from england that is sent to some relatives in the amazon. Although expecting the best of the amazon she gets a terrible let down when she realizes that her relatives try to bring England to the jungle. Luckily she meets some friends including her governess that help her live the adventure of the amazon that she was hoping for. This book would be on my top 50 book list if I had one.
3,Good..,I did not finish this book all the way. The first of the book was very interesting but once you got about three quarters in it became obvious what would happe. the ending just wasnt my thing.
4,Review,Would recommend for any grade school child 3rd grade and above. Excellent story for any child with a desire for adventure and a healthy imagination.
4,An interesting and fun read,I was reading several books to find a high interest book for my 10 year old granddaughter. This was great! A trip from an English boarding school to the middle of the Amazon River for a young orphan girl. I would recommend this book highly.
4,Jigsaw puzzle,"Eva Ibbotson sends her threads far and wide, and then draws them together in an almost perfect bundle, meaning she brings a lot of people into the plot, all with their own problems, and intertwines their troubles so there is a place for everyone. There is no one left hanging to worry about at the end of the book. On the otherhand, I find Maia to angelic to be true. She never looses her temper, or gets back at the evil twins. She believes everything told to her without suspicion. Otherwise I have no complaints. The suspense is fun, but not torture, and the plot wont leave any dissapointments."
4,useful tips,"I found this book very practical. Includes details on batteries plus storing, managing and sharing photos. It clarified something I had not been able to understand in another book (rule of thirds)."
5,A Remarkable Book!,"I have read this book and keep it by my side as I compose new tunes. It is like a songwriters bible. Harriet Schock's insight to songwriting is incredible. She helps you get perspective on what you already know and much you didn't know or think of. And unlike many ""how-to"" books which are written by people with no track record, Ms. Schock is an accomplished songwriter and a hit songwriter. I also have her CD's which are filled with wonderful songs. I recommend this book to new and veteran songwriters."
4,Songwriting meditations (?!),"I have had mixed emotions with this book. In the first place, is a collection of individual published articles. May be I was looking for something more sistematic. But after this first impression, you find the articles - chapters very insightful and full of wisdom. And all the time it seems that Harriet is talking just to you about her feelings and thoughts about songs, craft, bussiness, ethic, life, everything. That's beatiful and you'll learn a lot. But I hope that some day Harriet retires and write a REAL and wonderful book about songwriting. I'll be there to get the first copy!"
2,"NO ORDER OF BATTLE, MAPS TOO SMALL, BATTLES NOT INDEPTH.",I WAS LOOKING FOR A GOOD HOUR BY HOUR COVERAGE OF THE BATTLES OF EYLAU AND FRIEDLAND 1807. BUT THE AUTHOR FAILED TO DELIVER. TOO GENERAL OF INFO.
4,Great history book and great biography book,"This medium-sized illustrated book on the life of Abraham Lincoln covers the private and public life of one of America's greatest presidents. The book gives good balance to the different stages of Lincoln's life; including his youth, childhood education, teenage years, early days as a country lawyer, entrance into local politics, his marriage, and finally his rise to the presidency and his death. The book does not concentrate on the Civil War, but instead gives a full picture of the man, including his personal traits such as love of storytelling, good humor, and ability to win over people given enough time. Overall, a great book for students in middle school or early high school."
3,Pages Fall Out,"It is too bad that such a wonderful book is so poorly constructed. Mine fell apart the first time I read it! The text and pictures are wonderful, but the book itself is a waste of money."
2,a misleading title,"Since this book was called a photobiography, I expected that most, if not all, of the photographs and line drawings would be of Lincoln. Actually, the great majority of the illustrations were of anyone or anything but Lincoln. Considering the actual content of the illustrations, a better title would have been something about the life and times of Lincoln. Maybe it is just me but I think the title is misleading (somewhat)."
4,The details about him surprised me,"Lincoln is presented here as I have never seen him, in both text and photographs. The details about him surprised me; I knew, of course, that he was extremely tall and had had a limited formal education, but I had no idea his voice was high pitched and that he had so much trouble finding a good general during the Civil War and that he was shy. I also loved the fact that though he had a total of a year of schooling he was able to read and study himself for two years and pass his bar exam. The Civil War years were a revelation. Poor Lincoln went through general after general who was afraid to act. And Lincoln's assassination was so unexpected, coming so close to the end of the war. I could really feel Lincoln's anguish in trying to figure out how to lure back the rebel states without cruelty yet also closing the door forever on slavery."
5,A Picture is worth a thousand words!,This wonderful book of photographs of Lincoln and his times is an excellent resource for children of all ages. Photos really do bring history to life from the very first picture taken of Abe in 1846 until just before he was tragically assasinated in 1865. One can really see how the Presidency and the long Civil War took it's toll on Lincoln. Terrific text compliments the fabulous photographs. I recommend you purchase this book for the entire family to enjoy!
3,Poorly Constructed,I echo the people before me- it is sad that such a good book (that has won the Newberry medal for crying out loud!) should be so poorly constructed. The binding of mine completely fell apart and Amazon is great enough to give me a full refund even after the 30 day period.
5,Christmas In Noisy Village,I am 12 yrs. old and this has been my favorite Christmas book since the first time my mother read it to me. I would reccomend this book to anyone and everyone. Share this delightful story with your kids and watch their faces light up when you read it. They'll bring it out year after year!
2,Consider the Source,"Sally Jacobs of Boston, an old-media reporter, refuses to consider that any man like her subject does anything wrong in abandoning his child. She loves to describe the sexual addiction of Obama Sr. but offers no judgement of his behavior? In my opinion, this writer is so incredibly shallow and liberal that not any other of her opinions are worth reading. Apparently, ""tragic"" is a politically correct, so she will consider him that, but not ""sociopathic"" which was Bill O'Reilly's opinion of a man so abandons his child. If you are a loyal subject of this incredibly dangerous president, this bio of his dad is a must read. No Kool-Aid mix packets included."
2,Bad packaging,"These seem pretty well made, but the way they are packaged, only one door is well protected. Whoever makes or packages these needs to revise the packaging.The way they are packaged, it looks like one door damages the glass on the other door. I received one door in perfect condition, and the other one with broken glass. I was considering buying two sets when I bought this one, but I'm glad I didn't. I ended up replacing the glass in both doors (so they match).Pretty much a letdown."
5,Wonderful Product,"Originally bought (3) sets of the John Louis Closet Systems from Sam's Club for our Master Walk-in Closet, but wanted the glass doors also (too bad the doors only fit the top area of the towers). I ordered 5 sets of doors and most arrived in great shape and installed in minutes. One set was broken, but the return policy from Amazon was great. No color differences between the doors & original units. They look wonderful. We always get lots of compliments on our closet."
4,Kitchen Aid Tea Kettle,I am very happy with this tea kettle. The only thing I could see improved is that the lid is a bit difficult to get off and put on. It fits very tightly (which I realize is good!) and would be difficult for someone with pain in their hands to manage. Works fine for me.
3,Buy Oxo Good Grips kettle instead,"I love KitchenAid products, but the performance of this tea kettle is not up to the lofty standards that the company has set for itself.Positive: It is a beautiful kettle and the enamel coating looks very durable. The silicone grips are a nice touch.Negative: The whistle is not very loud. It would be easy not to hear the whistle if you are in another room watching TV. The kettle also does not pour the water very well. The water comes out seemingly from all angles of the spout and the kettle has to be turned nearly upside-down to get all the water out.It is not terrible, but for the same money there are better kettles on the market. Buy the Oxo good grips kettle instead - it is a better product."
3,Don't Buy if you have a glass top stove,"Dont buy this if you have a glass top stove, only buy the stainless steel version. As soon as we opened the package there was a warning telling us not to use this and when we called the company they said all of the kettles other than the stainless steel one can melt to your stove. I gave it a three because we never got to use it."
5,"Small, Dependable, Works Fine","Very compact design for mobile users. Absolutely plug-and-play and works well with WinXP (even if I only used Microsoft's generic usb hub driver). I like the included USB Control Utility and the individual LEDs for each port, the uplink, and for the power.Best of all, it's compatible with most of my usb devices: Canon i320, Canoscan LiDE 50, and Logitech Quickcam Messenger.The only negative comment I have is when connecting my Microsoft Notebook Optical Mouse to the hub (experienced this with Targus' hub also), the mouse emits a very annoying sound while I move it."
3,Help Me Understand...,"I hate to confess this, but this is one of those books I read and enjoyed on the surface level, but whose more meaningful level I did not understand at all. The writing is extremely good--Carey evokes specific places and moods quite well and I was thoroughly engrossed the whole way through. It is enjoyable simply as a series of well-told tales are, but as an allegory of Australian history and national character, it eluded me. Someone please explain it to me!"
3,Pales in comparison to 'Bliss',"Had Illywhacker been my first encounter with Carey, I would likely have enjoyed it more. But I've read Bliss. And Bliss is brilliant.Carey is a great writer, but his editor was too nice with this one. This book could be half as long, without losing any of the characters, descriptions, or plot twists that Carey is capable of.It starts off well enough, but there are blocks in which nothing happens, and it gets boring. I hate it when books get boring.Also, the ending is far too preachy and doesn't seem to jive with the rest of the book.There's another Bliss in there, but it's bogged down by an extra 200 pages that keep this book from really flying.An enjoyable read, nonetheless."
3,"Fun, deep, and frustrating","I very much enjoyed reading this novel. The robust prose, the thoughtful characterizations, the bursts of poetry, and the sustained pride in being a (white) Australian were all fantastic. However, this book of 600 pages never really lets you care about the narrator, which grew more and more problematic. After so long, you want to feel more for the story-teller. I was, however, entranced by the sense of righteousness about being a white Australian, and found the treatment of racism towards Asians constantly provocative. At the same time, for a book so preoccupied with Australia, it was strangely devoid of Aborigines and their plight at the hands of Europeans. I also found the ending tacked on and hardly worthy of the gusto of the rest of the book. Nonetheless, a pleasant, fascinating read."
2,Thematically brilliant but poorly written.,"Illywhacker is an almost surreal novel and therefore has both strong and weak points. This 600-page decription of the Badgery clan is peopled by extraordinary, larger-than-life characters and touches onto very real themes and ideas - from the opening (""my name is Herbert Badgery and I am a liar"") to the bizarre but poignant conclusion, Carey explores dozens of fascinating themes.The only disappointment is the writing itself. Sometimes painfully difficult to read, it is mundane and long-winded, full of unnecessary passages and incidents. None of the characters are highly sympathetic, and the reader never feels involved in their lives. And while the themes concerned are almost all interesting, he dwells relentlessly on many of them and they lose their novelty.A book not for the easily frustrated, it is so weakly-written and mundane that it is easy to lose sight of the originality and insight that lies beneath the surface."
2,Mixture of profundity and arrogance,"The author of this book understands--or at least grew to understand--the power of places. And he conveys that power thoughtfully and with occasionally wonderful prose. For these reasons, you should read this book. The problem with this book is that the author writes as though he alone possesses the wisdom and experience to divine the significance and meaning of these places. The characters (more properly charicatures) who dash across his pages--fishermen (""psychotic"" onces, of course), familiies, students of history, tourists, locals--all seem to possess some psychological or emotional disability that (to the author) renders their interaction with the battlefields somehow trivial, or even comical. By book's end, therefore, the only character left standing who can fathom the depth and meaning of the places is the author. It is an astonishingly arrogant chronicle."
1,"A disappointment, full of personal biases, little value","I thought this might be an excellent companion while touring the sites where brave men died for their respective countries. Instead it was full of personal left-wing biases, that made the book hard to read. Had I been able to read the book deeper prior to purchase, I would not have waisted my money. Sgt York a hick? That comment of his boggles one's mind."
2,A biased waste of time,"O'Shea takes an opportunity to write a useful traveler's guide to the Western Front and completely blows it by spewing a volume of drivel that maligns anyone and everyone who ever wore a uniform. His pacifist leanings may have been tolerable if they had been left on the sidelines, but instead they pollute every page, preaching rather than informing.What can be gained by calling Sgt Alvin York a ""yokel"" and ""hick""? By calling 1917's mass mutinies the French Army's ""finest hour""? The answer is the same as what can be gained by reading this book - absolutely nothing.As a previous reviewer stated, the only part of this book that is worth the paper it is printed on, hence a generous two stars."
1,This is a wretched book!,"Travel commentaries are great, usually, and this one was a great idea as he started out to honor his grandfathers who fought in WWI. However, instead of honoring history he ended up maligning his grandfather's generation. This is no history! This is just uncontrollable anger. I have never in my life found one who doesn't have a good word for Sergeant Alvin York but O'Shea can't find even one. But ... soldiers have fought and died for centuries so that O'Shea can write whatever he wants.I, for one, don't even want his book on my shelf. If anybody wants my copy, let me know."
1,A maudlin anti-war editorial.,"Mr. O'Shea starts with a wonderful concept - to walk the line of trenches from WWI and describe their location, history and present condition. Unfortunately, the book quickly degenerates into an ever-lengthening editorial against war and history's war leaders. With the clear view of hindsight - which he spends a page justifying - the author judges the generals of 1916 by the standards and knowledge of 1996. His pontificating becomes boring.Unforgivably, he also expresses his contempt and disdain for the amateur historians who purchase his book and line his pockets. Fortunately, this is partly compensated for by the inclusion of a list of references that far better meet the needs of the reader."
1,This guy is DEFINITELY NOT a historian!,"I purchased this book with the idea that I might get some more insight into the tragedy of WW1. While O'Shea DID grant me some new insights, I was extremely put off by his attacks on all miltary (professional soldiers are all idiots), historians (geeks), etc. Also, (and to some this may seem petty) his factual errors on minor areas (eg, he says Rickenbacker had 23 kills) and comparing Little Big Horn to My Lai, lead to question what other statements of fact he makes may also be questionable. I feel that overall I wasted my money on this purchase. Those who MAY enjoy the book would include pseudo-intellectual leftists who still think this is the 1960's!"
1,Boomer blows it,"This is a reductionist view of WW I seen through the eyes of a smug baby boomer who by his own admission has just discovered history. O'Shea has reduced this complex and horrific war--and its major actors--to a simple morality play. The prose is often purple and the tone of the book is self-righteous and contemptuous. I would agree with O'Shea that war is bad, and WW I was especially so, but this book offers no insights beyond these platitudes."
5,A Book I Will Never Forget,"This beautiful book is poetic, insightful, scholarly, and haunting. Thank God for writers of such compassion, intellect, learing, and literary talent. A book for the ages that should touch the hearts and souls of all thoughtful readers"
4,An insightful trek across the Western Front,"Mr O'Shea's epic trek across the western front, from Nieport to the last battered cement blockhouse on the Swiss border is a treat to read as we follow his 600 mile journey. This young Canadian's unique style of detailing the once terrible battles and the current condition of the scores of villages, towns and earthworks captures his own thoughts and that of history.An excellent means of learning more about the battles and the men who endured the worst war in history. Plenty of humor and some rather sad comments on some of his observations. I wish I had the time to follow in his footsteps for this would be a journey of a lifetime.The only regret I have is that there were no photographs, which would have enriched this book.Worth reading and learning from, a great treat for a rainy weekend or a long holiday or flight."
2,could have been great....,The arrogance of the author alienated me in chapter one...I couldn't read further....felt like I just wasted 5 minutes.
5,A+ For Design!,"I spent two or three nights online, picking out the perfect kettle. I wanted it to fit my modern/farmhouse sensibility. A tall order. Well, it just got here and I am trying it out now and all I can say is it's really pretty, sturdy, and looks better than the extremely expensive ones I've been thinking of from kitchen stores. Very pleased."
3,same old stuff,"This pretty much ended up reading in the same way we've been harping on this stuff for a while. Nothing really stood out to my son. However, if you haven't been a ""harper"", it might help you out."
4,Personal Hygiene,I found this to be a very informative book. It covers a wide range of hygiene topics for young people.
3,Good buy for the money,"Gloves have large gap around the wrist and they are very thin and break easy. Don't try scooping cat boxes with these if you have fingernails. They'll break right through. Otherwise, might be okay for cleaning up. They don't protect the hands very well for this purpose. For the money, if you don't mind gloves that are thin and tear easily, then it's a good buy."
5,Keeps leg cramps away,"I have always had a tendency to get charley-horses in my legs at night. I'll turn over and all of a sudden I've developed a lump like a tennis ball in my calf and it hurts like heck.I started using this product several years ago. Two tablets a day and no more leg cramps.Could be other supplements would work as well, but I figure I'll just stick with what I know works."
3,Don't be fooled by the color.,"It is in no way, shape, or form the color that is displayed in the photo. I bought this solely because of the amazing blue in the photo. But when I opened it from the box I noticed to my disappointment that it was like a dark midnight blue. I could've gotten an octgagon poker table anywhere with a different color. The only reason I purchased this particular one was because of it's unique color. Other than that, it seems sturdy enough and the padded rails and cupholders look to be good."
5,Great Product,"We love this table. Yes, the table is a little heavy, and the carrying case is a little flimsy, but the table has a great look and feel to it. I play tournament poker (Stars-n-Bars, Big Slick, World Tavern) regularly, and this table top is much nicer than 99% of the tournament tables I've played on. The cup holders are ok, but we use side trays for drinks and snacks like we do at the tournaments. Overall, great prodcut and heartily recommend as a good poker table."
5,Not a bad Poker Table for the price!,"Me and my buddies have a home game and we switch it up week to week at which house we play at, so the 79"" x 36"" Texas Hold'em Green Felt Folding Tabletop is perfect for our needs. It's not a vegas poker table, but good for home games."
5,If the price is right,"I think I bought this item for about $50, and it's totally been worth it. I don't think I would pay the original price of $129, but it is sturdy, and it fits perfectly on top of my round kitchen table."
4,Surprisingly Quiet,"I cannot believe how quiet this bike is! It was easy to put together, although in some places, it was a little awkward putting some screws in. As with most bicycles, the seat can be a little uncomfortable. After riding it for about a week, I got used to it. All in all, it's a great bike and for the money, it's worth it."
5,A Beautiful pair of shoes,These shoes are great!! They can dress up a pair of jeans or compliment a dressier outfit. Suprisingly comfortable for how high they are. The patent is a beautiful color (I have both brown and red). I never fail to get compliments on these shoes. I would definitely have one in every color!!
4,Cute shoes!,These shoes are very comfortable and really cute! Run a little small so be careful when ordering.
5,Love these!,"I got these in black... not sure what i will wear them with. Very cute, and pretty comfortable. Highly recommend."
4,a trigonometric approach to an esoteric art,"The advent of the mass-produced computer-designed truss roof has made the true roof-cutter a dying breed. There is a dearth of information on this complex subject, and this text is a welcome entry for that void. Unfortunately, while Mr. Gross is himself a talented roof-cutter and carpenter, he is less talented as a teacher and writer. I found his explanations lacking, although well-supported with drawings and diagrams. He introduces some very useful concepts, such as theoretical lengths and height-above-plate, and he encourages the solution to roof calculation problems by means of a trig calculator, rather than obsolete math tables. I found this book very useful, although weakly bound for the rigors of an oft-consulted text. In conjunction with Gross's book, I also recommend ""A Roof Cutter's Secrets to Framing the Custom Home"" by Will Holladay."
4,Very Thorough,"This is the best book for the ""nuts and bolts' of roof cutting. Not only does he emphasize the important topics, he reinforces them by using problems to test your newly acquired skills. The presentation of alternate ways to measure and cut a roof helps by providing tools to enable any framer to become an expert. Highly recommended to any carpenter who wants to take the next step or to the pro who just wants to hone his skills."
4,Nice book on Roof framing,"Well worth the money, I liked will holladays book also but these two books are my choice."
3,all math,"I hoped that this book would help with design of the roof of an addition I am building. It does not. I need ideas, rules and details for typical roof designs, this book is nearly all math. Since I am designing on CAD, I don't need to do or understand the math."
5,the source,I bought this album after returning from the Shetland Fiddle Frenzy. It is 'the bible' for Shetland fiddlers. The tunes are all widely known and played in Shetland.
2,Noisy little fan. Doesn't always start,"Got this fan for heatsink cooling. From the beginning it didn't always start right away and was noisiest little fan of all fans being used. I used it like this for many months and finally cut the cord as it will ba a task to get to the wire routing for the fan. I'm sure you understand if you've work computers to have to unplug everything to fix one item. I'm about to order a new replacement of different brand and design that hopefully will be as quiet as the rest of the fans in my system. Other people have had good luck with this, I havn't."
4,Pretty good,so i rated ita 4 because i just got it today but it was easy to set up just screw it in and plug it in. it kicks out a pretty good amount of air. better than the previous one i had which came with the dell. i would rate it a 5 for now but im not sure how long it will last ill just have to see. but so far i love it. thinking about buying another one and using it for intake :). if u need a good cheap fan this is the one.
5,"good fan, well worth the price","very nice, well worth it if your looking to keep your system cool. i have an ATI Radeon HD 4800 Series graphics card and i game alot. even after hours of playing, its still blowing cool air out of my case"
5,Just another fan for your computer,"It's what It's. A very pitch-dark fan, black, if you know what I mean. Sounds good, it doesn't bother me. Although as I said in another review I made, I live in front of a highway and listen to music all the time, mostly in a loudly way."
2,bearings go bad about 4 months in,makes horrible noise when first turned on. warms up for about 90 seconds before sound drops to normal. spend a little more and get a name you recognize.
4,Average White Band,"The AWB is great in this concert, as in the one live at Montreaux which is slightly better. Nevertheless AWB does an outstanding job on this DVD."
4,Faster Smarter Digital Video,"This book is not current but then I knew that when I bought it. Still a great ""how to"" guide for us newcomers to digital video and definitely a steal at $2.00, Shipped very promptly, so generally we are happy customers!"
2,I must be missing something...,"This book is VERY basic. I learned pretty much everything the book told me by doing my own research on digital camcorders, buying one (the JVC GR-D70U), and installing and running Pinnacle Studio 8. The book would not have helped me with my camcorder purchase decision, nor does its constant references to doing tasks running Windows XP help (since I use Windows 2000). I was also put off by the author's obvious bias toward Microsoft products. I realize this is a Microsoft Press book and some of that should be expected, but I've read other Microsoft Press books that were not nearly this bad. Ultimately, it's a lightweight read and a Microsoft marketing tool."
4,KJV Apocrypha; 1928 BCP; A Few Criticisms,"I bought this many years ago because the KJV Apocrypha is so difficult to find. I am very pleased with having the BCP (and its Psalms) with the Bible all within one cover. However, as a reviewer has already pointed out, the pages are thin and the type is difficult to read.Last but not least, page 842 (that is, part of the 6th and 7th chapters of ""Ecclesiastes"") is entirely missing. Of course, to actually complain about such a thing is, well, vanity. However, it does make me wonder what other errors the edition may contain.Having said that, I use this Bible frequently. I just watch for typographical errors."
1,leather bound vs. hard cover,I did not purchase this book due to the fact that I am looking for a leather bound or equivalent. I can not find this but if you can please notify me. I am a Postulate and of course entering into the Priesthood/Diaconate. I feel that Leather bound or equivalent would better serve me in the long run. Thanks for your help and support. Danny Mays
4,The Long Loud Silence,"This was a pretty interesting take on the usual post-apocalyptic survivor story. Uneven at times, but a lot of nice additions and details that can easily resonate with current national issues. Good story overall and worthy of a read."
4,Can't get it out of my mind...,"I read this book 20 years ago, or more, and at the time I thought it a good effort in the post-apocalyptic genre. I gave it away, or lost it, or whatever, but since then it's resurfaced over and over in my mind, and the feel and mood of the book have if anything grown stronger over the years. A gloomy, frightening book that ends with a sliver of hope. One of the few novels that have forced me to think about growing older....."
1,Don't buy these!,"I ordered these thinking, perhaps because that's how they were pictured and described, that they were square covers for a gas stove. Instead, I was sent round covers of various sizes for an electric oven. I was on vacation when they came and when I went to return the covers (usually an easy process with Amazon), I was told that my ""return window"" had expired (apparently I had 30 days - not convenient when you're on a 3-week vacation). I am greatly disappointed - not just with the incorrect product sent, but with Amazon's lousy and totally unexpected poor return policy."
1,you get what you pay for,"I bought this two-pack for $7.00 which seemed like a great deal. However, one of them had a dead display right out of the box, which makes it close to useless (although not entirely).Even if one of them hadn't been a dud, I would still be disappointed. These are hard to use. There is only one button to control all of the settings! This means that you have to press that button over and over to scroll through them and go all the way back around if you miss it.Had I spent more money I'd return these, but it's not even worth the hassle. However I would not buy from this manufacturer again."
5,"So far, so good.","I still haven't driven the car with the cambers, but they seem real sturdy and look good. The only problem I did have with them was the ball joint on the right rear camber stuck out too far and wouldn't fit behind the pinion gear cover. After I removed the ball joint it fit perfect, so I guess it really wasn't a problem after all. Other than that, so far..."
5,A nifty value,"This VCR is a 4-head with a comfortable remote and Hi-Fi stereo. At this pricepoint, it is a GREAT value for anyone who wants a good VCR, but doesn't want to spend a lot of money (heck, who DOES want to spend a lot?) =). If you're looking around at VCR's this is a nifty little VCR for the money!"
2,NOT FOR HDTV's,"If you have a high definition-big screen TV like I do, or used to crystal-clear pictures from digital cable or satellite, this is NOT the VCR for you. It is not powerful enough to record anywhere near the clarity you're used to seeing. I strongly recommend you cough up a few extra dollars and get a better VCR!"
4,Etnomathematics,This book is very interesting and presents some aspects very important to understand the development of Mathematics in Africa continents.
2,poor service in delivery,I am happy that the book has finally arrived after almost three months of its order in mid-December 2006. Otherwise no lament.
5,Kerry Classic!,"Kerry is one of the great fiddle counties in Ireland, and these three musicians are among the greatest of their generation. Recorded back in 1952 by Séamus Ennis, himself a great musician, in Charlie Horan's Bar in Castleisland, this is a true classic! You can leave behind the supergroups - you won't find more impressive talent or tasteful playing than this in the world of Irish traditional music. Listen out for the common habit whereby one fiddler plays the tune one octave below the other - just beautiful! If you love Irish fiddle music, you must have this album."
3,"Lots of understanding behavior problems, little curing","I was quite disappointed in this book. It is full of interesting stories of dogs and their troubles (like Maggie the German short-haired pointer and her false pregnancies), but I was looking for solutions to specific behavior problems. As another reviewer pointed out, some of the topics were quite bizarre and weren't intuitive (X-Files?) so I had to read the entire book to find what I was looking for. Based on the title (A-to-Z Guide), I was expecting quicker look-ups. In fact, the behavior-modification techniques are actually in the appendix, which is less than 20 pages long."
5,Ya gotta love Doc Dodman!,"I got this book after reading Dodman's other amazing work, ""The Dog Who Loved Too Much."" Where that book was mostly empathetic tales of disturbed dogs, ""A to Z"" is more educational -- but it still has inspiring anecdotes that keep it entertaining. I think Dodman is the Konrad Lorenz of the '00s: He is (seemingly) the first person to recognize that dogs have the same neurobiology as humans, and that they respond to the same medications and therapy (in dog terms, training) methods. Seriously -- penicillin works in both dogs and people... Why not Prozac?"
4,Interesting but disapointing,"This was an intersting book that covers many common behavior problems in dogs. As a strength, I thought it offered insight into why dogs commonly engage in these types of behaviors.As a weakeness though, the book wasn't organized very helpfully. A better index would be more useful in times of looking for help. In addition there wasn't clear solutions to each of the behavior problems mentioned. He offers ideas of what one could do, but doesn't explain it well.The main thing I disliked in this book was Dodman's seemingly high use of medications. Not that the use of medications is bad in certain dogs, but Dodman makes it seem like most dogs should be medicated from the get go. I am sure he does not do so in practice, but it comes across as such in his book.However, this was an interesting reading and one I will keep in my collection."
2,Not the best dollar ever spent...,"The book was so general that I found it quite unhelpful, at least for what I thought it would be useful for: helping me find a strategy for curbing excessive dog barking."
5,This one will keep you on the edge of your seat.,"Lori Lake has done it again. Bravo! Have Gun We'll Travel is the third book in her Dez Reilly/Jaylynn Savage series, and folks, they just keep getting better. It is an absolutely riveting novel you will not be able to put down. Fine writing, and a stunningly gripping, edge of your seat, story all combine to make this novel a winner. The plot is multi layered, but so well-structured and so 'tight' that it flows beautifully with each chapter drawing you to the next. Highly recommended."
1,So Disappointed!,"A horror movie that takes place in a mortuary where bad things have happened in the past. How could they possibly screw that up? Well, apparently they found a way. The first few minutes did an excellent job of setting the tone, but unfortunately, it all went downhill from there. Cheesy acting, horrible effects, and a head-desk-inducing plot ruined what could've been a great movie. Heck, even the Cthulhu couldn't save this movie!I picked this up really looking forward to it, but I was disappointed beyond belief. A horror movie designed around a funeral home should be easy to write. Instead they went in some weird directions that made no sense. Now I know why it was so cheap."
1,A low blow,"A noisy, shabby attempt at horror, if Tobe Hooper's name wasn't attached to it would anyone give it a second glance?The humor doesn't work, that minimal cast doesn't help, the plot doesn't amount to anything fresh or new. When things finally begin to happen there's just a lot of screaming and running amuck in dark chambers. This doesn't automatically translate into scares. And let's not forget that cheat of an ending, when the dead aren't really dead (as a matter of convention and convenience). Not worth the five bucks I paid for it."
1,MORTUARY DVD 1.5/5,"This movie really did seem like it could be PG-13 in some ways.I noticed the kid from ""The Hills Have Eyes"" in this film too. I honestly don't care whether or not a low budget horror film has unknown actors and actresses.It was blatant that ""Mortuary"" was a low budget project because of the crappy graphics throughout the film. Needless to say, the movie wasn't that bad as I thought it would be BUT:THE ENDING IS STUPID AND THE MAIN GIRL IN THIS MOVIE WAS ONE OF THE WORST ACTRESSES I'VE EVER SEEN BEFORE!"
1,Horrible movie!,The description of this movie hypes up about Bobby F still around the cemetery but the movie is barely about him. Its really boring and as soon as you think something is about to happen it does but then it stops and it goes back to boring talking again. They barely show him until the end and hes not even what he looks like on the cover. This movie is all about some weird vine from the ground that takes control of everyone. Granted its only ten bucks but don't buy it! Its horrible!!!! Shouldn't even get 1 star!
1,Not worthy of rating....Only chose one star because I had too.,"Ok. My husband is a MORTICIAN In real life. We bought this movie to have a little fun. After we watched it, that was 90 some minutes of our lives that we can NEVER get back. Even some of his co workers that he spoke with about this movie agreed that this is the WORST movie that you could ever watch. Its boring, lame, poorly made and not at all what the cover or the review on the back of the movie makes it out to be. If your considering watching this movie, do yourself a favor and change your mind!!!!! STUPID, STUPID, STUPID,AND STUPID!!!!! I see more excitement watching the paint dry on the wall."
1,Stay away from this crap fest...,"I was in the DVD store looking for a good horror movie that I could sit home and watch with my partner. That's tough because you get the high profile ones (which are few)and the low budget ones that you never have heard of; there are lots of these. There wee about 5 or 6 to choose from but I chose this one becaue of Tobe Hooper (may his career rest in piece) and because of Denise Crosby. Why I don't know since she hasn't done anything good since she thought she was moving on to big and better things by leaving Star Trek The Next Generation.About ten minutes in, I knew I had made a bad choice. Dumb characters and ubsurd dialogue plus terrrible writing. This can sometimes be a good thing if it is so bad you can laugh at it but this doesn't even reach that level.Mold. Zombies. Who cares"
3,"Tobe Hooper Gives Us Some Bloody,Cheesey,Fun !","Look horror fans if your looking for an itellectual mind-blower here your not gonna find it! If your looking for Tobe Hooper's next ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" or ""Toolbox Murders"" your not gonna find that either! What you will find is a fun campy horror film with a couple classic Hooper scares,plenty of blood & buckets of cheese. The only gripe i have with the film is the bloodbeast special efx/CGI bull crap but there is not enough of it to hinder this mindless fun horror film. I can't wait to get this on dvd!"
4,A Very Good Movie,I Am A Big Tobe Hooper Fan And This Movie Didn't Let Me Down.I Has Tobe Hooper's Usual Style Of Scary Direction.
2,dumb dumb dumb dumb,Dumb movie but the tennagers in house enjoyed it. Special effects show the quality of movie. For low budget it wasn't so bad.
3,"PLAYED STRAIGHT, BUT PRETTY FUN HORROR COMEDY!","This film is a throwback to 80's horror comedies, but the actors play it so straight you have to think.....are they serious? This thought only last for a millisecond as you watch the characters walk into every horror cliché ever used in these films.The FX are cool and have that 80's look to them, but the film does run out of steam halfway through. Overall I was entertained and I would recommend this one to my horror buddies for a few laughs. I caught this on cable, so I know nothing about the DVD quality or it's features."
2,Tobe you could do better....MUCH better,"This was a real disapointment. I had high hopes for this, because the premise had outstanding potential. The characters were trite and frankly lame. Another, teenage boy in the lead, new kid in town, seems weird to everyone blah, blah, blah. Original owners of the funeral parlor had a Crazy mutant son who is now living underground. Whatever! Just not enough creepiness and scare factor you would expect from living in a mortuary. Somebody should take this idea and re-do it the right way, instead of turning it into the same old tired mutant maniac vs. the teenagers crap."
3,this was pretty damn good.,"It's nice to see a decent horror movie, that doesn't take itself too seriously. this one will not dissapoint. good acting, good effects and occasional unintentional humor here and there thrown in. you should check this out."
3,Bursting with life,"This is quite a good little horror with a zombie theme, with a twist. The zombies share there power with a strange black weed.Denise Crosby plays the mom of two who moves to a new town to take up residence in a morgue set in the middle of a graveyard. Her son discovers a local curse, about a man named Bobby Fowler who killed a number of people before. And what would you know but Denise, in trying out a set of house keys accidentally leaves his tomb unlocked so he can wreak havoc once more!"
3,Tobe Hooper Strikes!,"Tobe Hooper just released his new movie Mortuary. I heard Tobe Hooper and zombie flick and decided to rent it. The movie itself could have been very good. I enjoyed it. Good sets, good plot, weird moments, a bit freaky. Pretty standard for Tobe Hooper's style(especially the dinner table scene). But I felt that this was one of those movies that needed gore. There was essentially very little gore. Well the hand scene, but that was computer animated. I like the movie. I would recommend it and would also watch it again. It just felt like the movie itself needed a bit more horror in it. The ending itself was absolutely horrible though. Worth a rental."
3,Huh?,This movie started out great and the actors are pretty good- however: the deal with the unveiling with Bobby Fowler: you'd think he was nice the way he was treating the girl he captured and you thought he was going to be a nice guy. All the sudden you see him about to do the exact opposite. And the ending is awful and does not bring and any resolutoin to the film whatsoever. Was it so hard to make a decent ending? I could've done it (with all do respect)
2,delivers what it promises,"if you like mindless drivel involving zombies, gore, teenagers getting off and offed in decaying graveyards, etc., as i do, this is for you. this, and a few tobe hooper offbeat touches garners this one two stars. what it promises it delivers - just don't expect too much. bit of trivia: alexandra adi, who plays liz, a sixteenish kid, and pulls it off well, was, if her filmograpy date of birth is accurate, 32 years old when this movie was released!"
1,One of the worst movies,The plot is silly the acting worse. Do not waste your money on this waist of time.The real horror here lies in the fact that someone would actually produce such a bad movie.
2,Im a sucker for bad movies,"I saw this movie in a bargain bin. Like ive said in the title and past reviews, I love cheap horror movies. This was made by a good director, so it might be good. The movie seems to ignore a few story lines and moves around all over the place. Decent movie, just dont follow it. Little gore but there is one cool gore scene. Overall, a forgetable movie."
2,forgettable waste of a tasteless mess....,"I picked this movie up quick on a Friday nite,(in a hurry, big mistake) a Tobe Hooper flick witha little horror to it, right from the start I could tell this one wasgoing to be a struggle. I love B movie horror flicks, I love tacky, lowbudget but I just wasn't very impressed with anything from ""Mortuary"", from the house(mortuary), the characters, the black spreading growth, the diner, the graveyard, the police, the pit, the deadand worst the living, they all were rotten. God, I hope I didn't giveanything a way to spoil. I've seen most of thisin one movie or another, they just threw it all together. Cheap, lame and not recommended."
3,Very good decent film,"This film is pretty decent. The story is a bit dry,the acting is some what there, but, there is some pretty good jump out of your seat thrill at times. I would recommend this only to those who are into zombie movies and that are looking for something different..then this film might be for you. However, a word of advice, rent this movie first to see if you like it, then buy."
4,Pretty quirky and fun,"Tobe Hooper has always done his films how he wanted...and it shows here. Although most of the reviewers here would have you believe this film is terrible, it really is not. It isn't a masterpiece, but it does ddeliver black comedy and some thrills along the way.If you liked The Covenant with Addrienne Barbeau, you'll like this off the wall entry. I found it to be more entertaining than alot of the horror out there today.Funniest scene was when they first arrive at the funeral home, and the little girl sees the coffin and thinks they brought daddy home to live with them."
3,"A few good covers, A few not so good.","Not as good a tribute album as others but still worth a buy if you are a Sabbath fan. Hoke in the Sky, Zerothehero, and Electric funereal are the best covers in the album. It is also intresing to here Paranoid in techno form. though many probaly will not like it."
3,Worth Buying for Black Sabbath Fans,I actually like this Album. Tho some won't. It has some good interpretations of Black Sabbath Songs. Get this if you've heard it all.
3,shotty attempt,the sacred reich and exhorder covers are excellent but the rest are poor tries at covers
4,good but not as good,"yeh but no,good covers of the masters of metal but still doesn't cut it with the orignals?"
3,Kitchen Chef,Saw exact same thing and it was described as a girl! Also saw the exact same doll and description was that he was a person who carries a shrine during festival time.
3,Not what I was looking for...,"I would love to find a Halloween decorations book designed for parents who work full time, and who do not have yards! We live in Chicago, and while we have parks, Halloween trick or treating is limited... and we want to find ways of jazzing up Halloween with little outdoor space to use, and also with limited time to make things. If anyone knows of a holiday sourcebook designed for the stressed out urban parent set, please email me!"
5,Great Music,"You can't go wrong with Jeff. Not only was this a good cd, but the price was right. Good solid music."
5,"funky, nice tunes",This is one of Jeff's best records. it has a nice variety of styles .. check it out!
4,Next CD in the Jeff Lorber Saga,"After waiting over a year for this CD I must say that it is well ""Worth Waiting For"". Jeff Lorber has once again shown another of his many talents. The greatest of which, is his ability to surround himself with great players. John Robinson plays the drums on most of the cuts. If you have never heard him take this piece of advice. ""SEEK HIM OUT"". Secondly Lorber has found another talented singer in Chelsea. I don't where he found her but she has style that just can't be missed. Check out the cuts ""Never"" and ""I Aint Thinkin' About You"" these are two Bluesy/Funky tunes that have some interesting changes on them. Then check out ""Midnight"" and ""Down Low"" very nice. For those of you who are use to the up-tempo rhythms of other Jeff Lorber CD's you won't find that here. What you will find is great music with a different perspective and insight. This is exceptional CD, and if you are Jeff Lorber fan like I am then you ""MUST"" add this one to the collection. Groove."
5,Stompin' Tom at his best,"This cd has some of the best stompin' tom that are hard to find in one place. ""Bud the Spud"" and ""Ketchup Song"" are unbelievable ""Luke's Guitar"" showcases some awesome vocals. ""She don't speak English"" and ""Canadian Lumberjack"" are unbelievable songs back to back and who could go without ""Sudbury Saturday Night""? If you only own one stompin' tom album, own this one!"
3,Great if you love Prince Edward Island!,"All of the music on this very funny CD sounds the same: like a Canadian, slow-time country-Western album. The first 2 songs in particular have very funny lyrics, and both deal with the primary crop of Prince Edward Island in Canada: potatoes. Hence the great title, ""Bud the Spud."" If you are not Canadian, however, or have never been to Prince Edward Island, you will not get the joke."
1,Do Not Buy This Book Unless You Like Being Confused,"This is the worst possible book you can buy if you want to learn ColdFusion. They introduce unexplained, confusing code, throwing in comments that seemed to have ""suddenly occured"" to them as they were writing something else. It's impossible to start at a low level and build up your knowledge. It is instant confusion. I'm a fan of Dummies Books - most are valuable. This one is awful. I hate it."
1,Con-Fusion,"This book is terrible. More often than not it is telling you to do something without telling you why. The tutorials are inconsistant. The document names it refers to are constantly changing. Worst of all, it will tell you it is going to teach you how to perform a task with a nice graphic and then drop the subject and move on without another mention of the subject. I wish I had never purchased this book."
2,ColdFusion 4 for Dummies,"This dummies book is one of the worst I've seen. Compared to other CF resources this is my least valuable one. Even if you are a beginner the examples are mediocre. Not to mention several valuable tags like CFHTTP and CFFTP are not even listed in the book. The organization of the book is also confusing as it is put into the ""dummies"" format. Instead of trying to write a ""funny"" resource they should have focused a little more on the contents."
1,not impressed,"I'm very sorry to say that I was not impressed by this book. I was expecting something that would teach ColdFusion to someone in an easy to read fashion. Instead, I found something that was confusing at the least and in some cases wrong."
2,"Cheap filter, You can do better.","The material is thinner and less dense than the Subaru air filter it was replacing. Additionally, the rubber seal around the filter is just held on with glue and easily comes off when installing. The genuine Subaru filter it replaced had the seal fused around the edges and was obviously superior quality.You can use this filter in a pinch, but I'd highly recommend theFram CA9113 Extra Guard Rigid Panel Air Filterinstead. Subaru often uses re-branded Frams for their ""Genuine Subaru"" parts anyway."
1,Not worth your time or money,"This cursory and vapid monograph is unnecessary and unhelpful. Every novice has seen much of this material in his introductory text. Whatever he may find to be new is passed over with so light a touch as to add nothing to the understanding. The practitioner will find no tools, methodologies or insights to enhance his work. I'm not an academic, but it's hard to imagine one could look here for anything. The work is not completely useless, as it serves admirably as a bad example.Over the years there has been a lot of this sort of expensive nullity from Fabozzi. Caveat emptor."
3,A great summary on the subject,"This is one book that gives you a quick start. It is best served as an introduction to this subject.The beauty of this copy is in that it puts together issues in a short and precise manner. It does away with much of the academic content but focus on practicality. If this is your first time doing corporate finance and strategy, then READ THIS BOOK."
4,West Business Law,excellant book i saved a bundle because this was a used book which was in good condition
5,Nu NRG is Elite,"I heard the promo long before the album came out which only made me want this album for my collection that much more. Out of all the music I listen to, about 75% of it is trance or some other genre of electronica. Nu NRG has become one of my favorite producer/dj's to listen to. This album is excellence from start to finish. I would most certainly recommend this album to the beginning or even seasoned trance addict with it's uplifting and somewhat euphoric beats and buildups. If you're a true trance addict or are just getting into trance and want a great album to listen to, get this album. You'll love it guaranteed."
3,"Good for choosing schools, not scholarships","I was looking for a good source for scholarships and grants for art and design students that could be used at the school of your choice. This book turned out to be a comprehensive list of all the art programs in schools in the US, and the scholarships that they offer. There was not info about how to apply directly to the scholarships, and/or if they were applicable to other schools. Bottom line: If you haven't chosen a school, it may help you, but it's of no use if you are already enrolled ( you can then get info about aid directly from your F/A office). I am still looking for a good list of art and design specific scholarships, and would appreciate any leads......"
5,It works,"Quality tools, prompt delivery, works as advertised. I like the holder. Keeps the tools secured in place and prevents them from being lost. Would recommend to a friend."
3,Not actually portable....,"This hammock is cumbersome to put together and difficult to take apart. It is very heavy in its tote bag and does not actually ""fold"". The metal tubes do disconnect but I would hardly call this a folding or convenient for travel item. I am very disappionted in that respect, though it is comfortable, despite its narrowness. A good cheap hammock but only if you plan on leaving it in one place."
3,"Handy, portable hammock","I bought this as a gift for my son in Florida. He found it very easy to set-up, convenient to store. There is one problem, though. His backyard is apparently fairly soft soil and, being FL, often wet. The hammock sinks too much into the soil when he gets in it (he is a very fit 23 year old with no body fat, so it isn't overly heavy). He will figure something out, but it is something to know before you purchase."
1,missing a piece,"This may or may not be a nice hammock. The product was shipped to me missing a part of the stand. I'm in Baghdad and it didn't take long to ship, but I e-mailed the company about the missing piece the day I picked up the item. It's been two weeks and I haven't heard anything back."
3,Almost..,"One thing that I can't stand authors do is they say they are writing a ghost book and then when you gather up every talk on ghosts it's only about a page. Haunted New Jersey does this.The author will give you 3 pages talking about the history of the certain bar or restaurant, hotel, what-have-you, then the last paragraph of the chapter goes ""To this day they still hear footsteps and every now and then see a shadowy figure""....this is not ghost business! This is a travel guide masking itself as a ghost book. Please Ms. Martinelli and Mr. Stansfield, don't do this again! I personally have very limited money so when I buy a book it usually needs to be a surefire hit because I rarely get to buy all these kinds of books. When I pick up a ghost book I want it to be A GHOST BOOK.John McAdam, author of:Enoch and the Extraterrestrials"
2,Haunted New Jersey: Ghosts and Strange Phenomena of the Garden State,"The format of this book is unappealing. The font is small and the top and bottom margins are set for less than six inches, giving the appearance of very wordy pages. The book relates ghost stories in a verbose fashion, each story could be told in less than a page."
4,funny movie,Always good for a laugh...fairly family friendly. Good castNothing serious at all just a good time for allLike it
2,downer,It's not a good one that you can barely make out of the strongest and I think that you would never be aware of the senior vice versa and the ocean is flat against a lot of different levels of the senior officers I give it a two
3,Just OK,"If your looking for a movie for a family night with a bunch of 10-14 boys, this movie works. Parent approved."
3,just a cute beanie,Beanie babies are probably not meant to be educational- my reason for the purchase was that my grandson loves fish and Beanie babies so it was a no brainer...
4,"A cute, classic mobile!","This is a very nice musical mobile for baby's room decorated with small stuffed puppies and airplanes. It's a traditional wind-up mobile - no remote control, flashing lights, or electronics - just a jaunty music box version of ""Rockabye Baby"" and about a minute and a half of slowly rotating puppies and planes.This came mostly assembled and took less than a minute to put together. It hooks onto the crib with a large, plastic ""screw"" that I think would work on almost any type of crib with side slats. My only complaint is that it doesn't have much variety. It would have been nice if the puppies varied in color, size or shape, instead of being exact duplicates of each other over and over again. Nonetheless, I would highly recommend this mobile to anyone looking for a simple and timeless way to soothe baby."
3,"Had a defect, but i still likes",My Yin Yang symbol is not upright like it is showed on the site. My shirt came with it side ways. Still a very good quality shirt just wish it was upright.
2,ONLY IF YOU LIKE BROSNAN,A VERY WEAK ACTION THRILLER MOVIE. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME. THIS MOVIE TRY TO MIX THE ACTION WITH A THRILLER PLOT BUT THE HYBRID RESULT IS NOT GOOD.
1,NOT A PIERCE BROSNAN BEST!,"CD was in very good condition, but the movie was rediculous! The acting was awful; probably Pierce Brosnan's worst movie. None of the characters were believable - just seemed to be going through the motions to collect their money. I was extremely disappointed as I had expected a much better movie based on the description and reviews. Can't imagine where the good reviews came from, or maybe I'm just nuts!"
3,"One for late night TV, hardly DVD","One of Pierce Brosnan's early films, and it sure feels like it. I am a big fan of Pierce, but feel he is more suited to the suave world of James Bond and Remington Steele, than a little Irish village fighting the big bad men. Brosnan is a good actor, but this is not the film to showcase his talents enough. As for it being on DVD, I don't think so! If it was harder to find it might make it more talked about, as it happens, it is, for all the wrong reasons."
5,Poems of longing and seperation,"This is one of my favorite anthologies of poetry, worth reading repeatedly. It captures the spirit of a man, so much like us all, who longs for that something beyond the next hill or behind the wistful smile. How many of us sense intuitively that life is wrapped in a mystery, the veil of separation thin? Hesse's poetry, like his novels, reminds me that even though the inner meaning to life often seems just beyond my reach, it is none the less to be found in the quotidian activities of breathing the fresh air, cutting the finger on the edge of a dish, or listening to Bach as I clean the garage. Written almost 90 years ago, his poetry still rings true to the wandering steppenwolfe in each one of us. ""The Gate of Heaven is everywhere.""You may also be captivated by another moving anthology of poetry, ""Against Forgetting"". It is an anthology of 20th century poems of witness, suffering, and hope."
5,Spanish for Little Ones,Both my 3 year old and 5 year old love watching this DVD! The simple Spanish phrases are easy to use and remember. My children began to repeat and understand the phrases almost immediately.
3,It's Alright.,"It's not a bad product, but not what I was looking for. This is intended for slightly older children than I have. I was mainly looking for building my kids Spanish vocabulary. This is above their heads, but would be better for kids in the 6-9 range."
4,"I didn't love it, but I didn't despise it either. :)","My kids enjoyed this dvd, but I think they had a bit of difficulty trying to grasp some of what the words they were saying meant. It is cute, and while they can sing the songs, I think it was still a little too intermediate for them (they are 4, 5, and 7). But it is a great resource to have & I'll hold onto it in the hopes that they will get more from it in another year or two. It's hard to find good Spanish resources for kids! That it's good quality alone, gives it four stars!"
3,So-So,"I wasn't impressed with this video as I thought I would be. It was a simple, very simple introduction to the language. Perhaps my son needs a higher level, but in looking for a higher level spanish dvd for children I would not get this series of professor parrot. It was a test to see if I thought the material showed in its very SHORT 30min video would be up to par, but it wasn't. Oh well, it can be used as a simple brush up but not for people that already know some Spanish."
4,We want a whole series of Proffesor Parrot in Spanish!,"My son, aged 2, loves the ""bird"" videotape! I'm trying to teach him spanish but I'm having trouble finding visual materials in Spanish for him. This video touches the basics in an entertaining way so it's engaging for kids. The acting and singing isn't top notch but it serves the purpose: my son has been belting out the ""colores"" song at the supermarket!I just wished they would make a whole series of it with more advanced vocabulary because this video is quite short and makes you want to see more!I speak Spanish so I don't need subtitles, but I agree with other reviewers that it would be nice to have them.Overall: the most engaging teaching material we have found so far."
1,Protects the mattress and is comfortable too!,"I wish I had known about this product sooner all of the mattresses in my house would have had them and the occasional ""accidents"" the kids had would not have been a worry. We started with one on our Memory foam mattress and we both think it's great. It feels great to know there are no dust mites ""living"" in the mattress! Just pop it in the washer every other week or so; have had it over a year and it's holding up well."
1,Only buy this if you are enrolled in his class,"The only reason I could possibly see to buy this book is if you taking his class. As a general intro to AI, the book doesn't really offer anything more clearly or in-depth than wikipedia does. It's pretty short, so he doesn't spend a lot of time explaining concepts, he just sort of blunders onward. It is also fairly dated."
3,What one might expect from a book of this size. Interesting read and a concise early account of the Wake Island Battle.,"Wake, War and Waiting does not represent a particularly unique perspective of the events that surrounded the Japanese invasion of the small American outpost in the last few weeks of 1941, but it remains as one of the first published survivor accounts of the battle and subsequent saga in Japanese captivity.Not a book of particular heft, modern readers may find Kephart's mid-20th century vernacular the only hindrance.Generally a brief and enjoyably read, Wake, War and Waiting is another micro-perspective, first-hand, anecdotal account that was first published so soon after the end of the events it recounts should keep it on the radar of any Wake Island scholar although not a particularly scholarly text."
4,Great Little Camera,"The camera is great and has great features for the price. 20 second no audio digital video capture is definitely a bonus. If you have any experience with digital photography you might find this model a little boring, you get what you pay for. The xd picture cards are very small and a little more expensive than the smart media cards. The digital zoom is ok. Battery life is ok if you set the camera on powersave. On the included 16mb xd card you can fit about 30 mid quality photos and about 18-20 high quality photos(2Mpixels). If you're in the market for a good, inexpensive, digital camera this is a great buy."
3,"Pretty watch,but a pain to wear","This is a beautiful watch. It looks exactly like the photo when it arrives. The only problem is that the band is very slippery! The metal post constantly slips out of the metal holes no matter how loose or how tightly I wear it. I no longer wear the watch for fear of losing it. If you purchase this watch consider buying a leather band for it, so that you won't have the same problem."
2,"Terrible, Terrible documentary/biography","I was very dissapointed when i saw this DVD. I had just seen the fantastic Richard Avedon DVD the night before.I didnt know anything about Helmut Newton, and i wish i did... because it would of saved me the time and money i spent on this dvd. Newton's work is quite flat, uninspired and for the most part sexist (...).If you are interested in photography, see the Avedon video instead."
4,Good taste?,"This is a fun documentary on Helmut Newton. I was at his lecture at the New School and the film gives you the same feel for him and his work. Most of the photos are sexy, he has a wonderful photographic identity, you can always spot his work. The DVD and video (they are not exactly the same) are worth watching for any serious fashion or commercial photographer. This is not a how to do a photo DVD. However, if you pay attention he tells you a lot about how he likes to work. Straight ahead, almost no camera hardware or crew and lots of vision. You know he saw the shot before he took it."
3,I don't know what hurt most...,"Seeing Helmut for the male pig that he really is or seeing those poor women lose all self respect as they posed for him. Nevertheless his work is wonderful and it was nice seeing exactly how he does it. I loved it from an artistic point of view, it really gets into his head and reveals what we may not want to see... he's just a simple guy who likes to make money and his reputation have gotten larger than life and women throw themselves at him. Or, the fact that he's just plain damned GOOD! Helmut's work is captivating, very rich in tone and contrast, and quite frankly spellbinding. You'll enjoy this DVD especially if you are a photography student or pro."
5,excellent boots,"I'm really happy with these boots as they are the most comfortable I've ever worn. The boot has some sort of memory foam material padding the inside and makes it extremely comfortable to walk in. It is worth mentioning that the laces are extra long, and are meant to be looped once behind the ankle before being tied, but you can always replace them if this is bothersome."
2,Very hard to understand,"We used this book in our Introduction to Probability course at Georgia Tech. This book is written in a not-so-easy to understand matter and is good for someone that has a strong background in math. A few of my friends doing their Ph.D were helping me with this course and they also found this book hard to understand as well. If you read the text you're still gonna have such a hard time doing the exercises because it doesn't explain everything smoothly. I searched through the internet to find a solution manual for this book and simply they don't have it. You only get the solution if you get the teacher version. The book is written and published in Netherlands and it doesn't have any online resource for students. If you have to buy this book for your class make sure you get ""Schaum's Outline of Probability, Random Variables, and Random Processes"" or a similar book for extra help, otherwise you'll regret like I do."
4,"Excellent book, but needs proofreading","I have a strong general background in math, but not in probability and statistics. I use this book for self-study, and I find that it fits that purpose excellently. There are plenty of examples, and problems are adjusted so that they focus more on principles and understanding rather than on grunt-work calculations.My main objection, and the reason for giving it 4 stars, is English language. I am not a native English speaker, and it's obvious that none of the authors is either. Even worse, I encounter at least one misleading, or hard to understand sentence per chapter (mostly among problems). The book most definitely needs proofreading and language corrections!"
3,need more exercises,"It is a beautiful book to read, yet, from a student perspective, the number of exercises at the end of the chapters should be tripled.I think authors managed to achieve a true balance between theoretical perspective and computational aspects of the subject."
1,Missing a few steps,"Unfortunately this book severely lacks step by step examples and makes many assumptions about what the reader does and does not know. I know calculus but most of the steps in the example problems are skipped over. Each chapter is divided into four or five sections but each chapter is only around ten pages long. This means that an entire section of knowledge is crammed into two pages. Add in that half of a page is usually used for a picture and you end up with a book full of theorems but lacking in substance. These aren't even formulas per say but instead are chapters filled with starting points. To elaborate about how bad this book is; I bought a study guide which has more full detailed step-by-step answers than this book. In fact the ""full answers"" in the back generally consist of one sentence answers but there are no graphs or step-by-step guidance."
2,Poor image quality,"This is obviously a very old VHS that has been transferred to DVD. The Images are grainy, fuzzy and worn. None of the crisp images or vibrant color you expect from modern cinematography. It looks like it was shot in the early 80's on VHS tape.That said, the content is exactly as advertised. Sweeping beautiful landscapes presented in time lapse photography. Great for playing in the background.Overall while l enjoyed the content, I felt cheated by the image quality. What they should do is go reshoot this in high definition. Now THAT would be a video worth buying."
4,Nice... but short,"I had been looking for this type of thing for some time. Sometimes I just want to give the room some ambience without actually having to tune into a TV program. This was just the thing. The scenery in this DVD is really beautiful. I could just watch and meditate almost. Even though the music is relaxing and fits with the scenery, its sound quality could be better. I don't even think its in stereo. A minor point I suppose, considering I usually run it while listening to CDs. Its a bit short too... only about 30 minutes. Not exactly a deal for 18 bucks... The makers sell it for 25 on their website. They do however have several offerings, some of which are a solid hour. For the price its a little short of my expectations in duration, but I'm liking it..."
5,GREAT BOOK,"Being a professional bodyworker for the past 17 years, I've read many books on how to improve my skills and I have found Art Riggs book to be the most instructive and comprehensive one I've ever had the good fortune to read. It's written in an easy-to -understand format that both long-time and new practitioners can relate to.In this book, Art has the unique and masterful ability to be able to teach anyone techniques and skills that normally can only be taught in a hands-on classroom situation. The high-quality instructional photographs and anatomical drawings blended with his excellent writing skills make it a book that should, in my opinion, be read by everyone who is serious about improving and growing their practice. This book could well become one of the ""Bibles"" of the profession.Kerry LoebOakland,CA"
3,good with DVD,"Nice graphics and photos. Without DVD, it offers not much to lean how-to part. To me, the book doesn't work much without DVD, which is very costly. To compare with other books of this area, this book is little expensive for the content. The method itself seems to be very good."
5,Great service,I was surprised at how fast my package arrived. The book was in excellent condition & I would buy from this vendor again.
4,Good book for Reference.,This book is very well written and I appreciate the Authors techniques. This is a great book to review specific body areas before a client comes in. It will help open your mind with a different approach.
3,DVD??,This book is great! I am disappointed that as it progresses it has reference to a dvd where the stuff is shown in motion. IT has a DVD chapter and second counter so that you can find the techniques on the DVD.... Only there isnt a DVD....
4,Good refresher for recent massage graduates,"I recently became a Certified Massage Therapist. I had great classes in Deep Tissue technique, but did not receive a visual guide as a text. Although it may not be the most practical guide for those of us who work in salons (a lot of the work is shown in a side-lying position), it is an excellent review for those who are going to work in a clinical setting."
4,Good book!,"If you are a professional MT, I would recommend this book to get some deep tissue pointers and ways to save your body. Think I might get the DVD series too!"
5,"Finally, a drug handbook you can read","The publisher's comments are, for once, right on the money on this new book, but they seem to gloss over the big news--the page layout is fantastic and you can actually read the type! I also found it full of very practical information and geared to the nurse rather than the MD. There are a lot of drug handbooks out there (maybe too many, in fact) but this one is the one I'm probably going to use the most often."
1,Does NOT fit all,"I ordered 2 hats to replace one that is wearing out. The fabric appeared to be cheap, made in China, and at the largest setting, DIDN'T COME CLOSE TO FITTING. An email requesting FULL refund because of false advertising (one size fits all) went unanswered."
3,Not the original parfum,This is not the same parfum I purchased from Sephora before. It's a spray which the scent lasts much shorter than the parfum. And the scent smells weird. Would not recommend to friends.
4,Christmas Vacation,"Park ticket prices in the book were not the same as the actual purchase price. The book has good infromation for planning a vacation, especially at Christmas time."
5,Needed for Disney!,This is a must have for travels to the big mouse! This guide is the tell all- and approved by Disney! Lots of needed facts!
5,EXCELLENT INFORMATION,"Book is #1 to me. So informative, a must have for first timers or people who have been time and time again."
3,So-so at best,"I was very excited to order this book up until the time I received it. The pictures are glossy and there is lots of character art but there is little in the way of substance. In fact, I was shocked at how thin this book was given its cost. It really seemed as though I was paying for the Disney copyrighted art and photos rather than information. Most of what I read in this book was something I had found on various online sources. The best part were the large colorful maps even though they aren't up-to-date (for example, the resort map doesn't show Crescent Lake near Epcot even though it shows the vague location of the resorts surrounding it). The Park maps are also quite colorful and easy to read. If you want a really basic guidebook that glosses over a lot of information without providing much substance then this might be the book for you. If you are looking for much more however, check out the web and save your money."
4,"Very good book, but wait for the 2006 edition.",This book has lots of useful information. The book is somewhat dated already. I realize that Disney changes frequently. If you are planning a trip for the end of 2005 or 2006 I would wait for the 2006 book to be released.
4,Gets the job done,"My only complaint is that it can be tricky to get the battery to make the proper connection with the charger. Simply pushing it all the way into the charger doesn't work. I have to wiggle it forwards a bit until it makes the proper connection and the charging light comes on.Still, it works, and you can't beat the price compared to the Sony branded chargers.Three stars, +1 for the price."
2,Rent it for the bathtub scenes,"""The Babysitter"" is essentially an Erotic Thriller but not a very good one. A lot of the actors are not that good and at times, it's just plain boring. Tuesday Knight has a very brief role as ""The Waitress"". The scenes with Alicia Silverstone in the bathtub are what merit viewing this otherwise dismal flick. Rent it for the bathtub scenes. Tuesday Knight completists: buy a cheap copy.Grade D+"
3,good deal but not in collectible condition,"It's a bunch of oscar winning movies from warner brothers with a great discount. but collectors beware of this set :1. First of all, most of the items are not sealed. many of them looks like new, but some are not brand new, at least look like used!2. I talked with 3 persons who purchased this item. all of them had complains about ruptures at the edge of some boxes which had caused with a blade or a sharp instrument.3. there is not a huge outer box. only a wrap around all items.after those negative points, lets say that, all of the DVDs are the best releases of each item. my word is, it's a good deal but don't expect to receive all of them in collectible condition! I don't want to blame warner but it seems that some of these DVDs are clean returned to market items!"
1,"Well, I used to like Dennis Leary..not any more","Rescue yourself by not watching this one at all. This was by far the worst comedic performance I've ever seen. From a guy I though was hyterical, failed miserably at trying to make people laugh. Quite honestly, I hope I never see this guys face again."
5,Denis Leary & Friends Presents: Douchbags & Donuts,"Denis Leary is at his best in this video. If your a fan of Denis Leary or of Rescue Me you will find this to be very funny. Lenny Clarke is a gem in this as is Adam Ferrara, they have a new comedian with them and she is quite funny also Whitney Cummings. All in all you will fall in love with this video"
4,Best we have found,"Our daughter's wheat-sensitivity was diagnosed approx. 2 year ago. We have tried several gluten-free, ready-made pizza crust and also tried making our own from varing recipes. This is the best pizza crust we have found. The texture & ""crunchiness"" is great. We bake it prior to toppings so that it will be crunchy. We have served it to friends who could eat any pizza they want and they could not tell the difference. And it does not have to refridgerated until it has been opened.I suggest anyone with wheat/gluten issues try this."
4,"good for gluten free, bad for pocket book","They use to be part of the subscribe and save program which still cost us 47.00 but now that Amazon became even more greedy it is not 56.00 which bothers me greatly, my 7 year old daughter love them and she has a very bad gluten allergy (hives and respritory problems) so it becomes worth the money to make her happy but it really does seem wrong of Amazon to charge 9.00 more just because they know people with allergies will seemingly pay what ever it takes to have some sense of normal diet. one persons review states that the crusts smell bad when you open them and that is very true...almost like gym socks, we have eaten them for a long time with no ill effects and the company assues us that this is normal."
3,Not that good,"They're too thick and so they dont cook evenly. What I eventually started doing was putting it in the oven alone until it browned, then taking it out and putting on the toppings on the most heated side and cooking again, it turned out best that way. But it still wasn't that good. I put a bunch of seasoning on it but it never quite had a good enough taste, really sad... This is so expensive too, I got it when it was $29- I would not get it again."
4,Very Good,"These are very good - not as good as the gluten counterpart, but nonetheless, good. I like to keep these on hand so when we feel like having pizza at the last minute, I don't have to spend a couple of hours preparing the crust. Good job!"
1,1st 13 pages are useful,"I got some value from the first 13 pages, but the rest of the book was a waste of time. There are so many screenwriting books out there that are much better, including ""Your screenplay sucks!""."
5,Great book,Hey everybody. This is William Biagioli from Brazil.I've been pursuiting this book for a while and finally got the chance to read it.It's a phenomenal book for everyone who's interest in Screenwriting and a differente approach for the 3 acts structure.Don't hesitate in get one.All the best!William Biagioli - Curitiba - Brazil
5,I wish I had bought this while I was at the Tower,"When I was in London last summer, I went on a guided tour of the city. One of the stops was a tour of the Tower of London. I got to see the Crown Jewels up close. Now that's what I call a rock collection. After I saw the Crown Jewels, I stopped in the gift shop near the exhibit and bought the book about the Crown Jewels. I didn't go to the other gift shop at the exit of the Tower, if I had I probably would have bought it while I was there. I also have the Illustrated History of the Tower of London which I just started reading. What I have read so far about the origins of the Tower are fascinating. As I get deeper into the illustrated history of the Tower and read the souvenir guide book, I'm sure that I will learn a lot from its bloody past."
1,Useless,"I owned this camera for maybe a year before the battery compartment cover broke.After that I used a piece of electrical tape to secure the compartment since it wouldn't stay shut and kept dropping the batteries out from the bottom.After about another year and a half,the whole camera became useless.Everytime I go to take a picture,it shows nothing but black on the display.I have tried changing every setting I possibly could and went to the Kodak troubleshooting info. on their site and it told me there was nothing else I could do but send it in for repair.For a 2 Mega pixel camera with 2x zoom it's not even worth paying for the repair because nowadays you can get much more for less money.It's now useless.I'm very disappointed and won't buy a Kodak camera again."
3,Reliable but aging,"I've had this camera for 4 years now and its definately showing its age. Many cell phone cameras on the market now have a higher resolution than this thing. But for a simple point and shoot camera it does its job pretty well if you don't plan on printing anything larger than a 4x6 or cropping at all.The build quality is pretty good... I've dropped this thing numerous times, and while the plastic casing has cracked because of the fall the interior still funtions like it's new. Listen to other reviewers when they say this thing eats batteries. The most I can take with newly recharged batteries is probably about 30 pictures without flash. Another con is that it takes very poor pictures in low light. The picture becomes pretty grainy.This was a good buy at $99 in 2003, but is probably barely worth half that now."
2,a completely useless camera,"this camera's lack of any battery life at all makes this camera absolutely useless. with the rechargable batteries that it comes with, as soon as you insert them fully charged, it indicates half battery life and the camera lasts no more than maybe 4 pictures. i've replaced the batteries with new kodak rechargable ones, but the same thing happens. what's the point of a camera if it is impossible to hold enough energy to use through a single session?i see that many other consumers are complaining about this as well (even the consumers giving the camera four stars!)absolutely DO NOT BUY this camera because you'll be finding yourself bringing bulk packs of batteries to your next family gathering."
4,Great camera,"Compact, light, and does it all. About the only thing about it that I don't like is that it takes a second or two from button-press to capture -- which makes it hard to catch a moment sometimes. But otherwise it's a great camera. Good battery life, nice bright screen, and crisp big pictures."
4,Great camera,This is the perfect camera to start with in the digital world real user friendy . And for the price well worth it i just wish it had a higher zoom level but for the price just perfect
1,The Choppers: Tommy Ivo's T Bucket?,"Not sure. But that looks a lot like TV Tommy Ivo's Buick powered T bucket street rod that Arch Hall, Jr is zipping around in.This story of young car thieves doesn't completely flop thanks to the film's somewhat business-like pace. There's a kind of sincerity of effort to 'The Choppers' that makes you stop laughing at the amateurish acting and dialog long enough to pay attention. The ex-Playmate of the Month in the role of the insurance guy's always hungry secretary provides another reason to pay attention."
1,A Poorly Made DVD,"This movie is a Juvenile Delinquent classic, but its such a poorly made DVD it's a cryin' shame. The print is the worst I've ever seen, looking like it was put through a Cuisinart. The Chapter Search doesn't even have titles, like the distributor was too busy to bother working on this disc and getting it right. Get the Something Weird DVD instead."
3,More Top-Flight B-Movie Cheese,This is a great cheesy movie (very much along the lines of Hot Rod Girl). Lots of unintentional bad acting and dialogue. Arch Hall Jr. and his buds are teenage car choppers - with guns! Who would have thought that the seats in cars would be worth so much money... Very enjoyable if you like this kind of stuff.
2,Too Much Is Missing From The Choppers,"Although The Choppers does look great, it's unbelievably missing nearly ten minutes of footage. The first cut scene brings up the stakeout plan and the last has Arch Hall Jr. singing ""Monkeys In My Hatband"" (which another reviewer mentioned.) The longest takes place at the Chick-A-Dilly with Marianna Gaba playing detective while enticing the gang in order to find out the owner of the hotrod the police are after. It's her best scene where she does more than just look sensational. The Choppers is entertaining and would have been even better without these cuts. Cutting ten minutes out of a movie that ran only 66 to begin withmakes absolutely no sense to me. A couple of other versions are available, but I don't know if they are complete or not."
1,Why is the Grinch Yellow???,"I must agree with the reviewer who was complaining about the color of the Grinch. The Grinch in THIS version is indeed YELLOW, not green. On the cover of the DVD case, the Grinch is Green. On the disc itself, the Grinch is Green. In the actual show, however, the Grinch is definitely YELLOW. Obviously a bad transfer to DVD. I've put this DVD on several DVD players and it is always YELLOW, so it's this version of the Show, not the DVD players. This version of the show should have been recalled. I've heard that the 40-year anniversary edition has the original Green color restored."
4,People selling their copies on eBay?,"In the other reviews, several people have stated they sold or will sell their copies on eBay because of the alleged yellow instead of green Grinch. I can not understand this. If I didn't want my copy of this, I would NOT sell it on eBay. I would sell it on Amazon auctions or in their zShops.However, I do have this DVD. I am not selling my personal copy because I like it so much. Chuck Jones and the animation is great. The songs are great. The extra features and commentaries are nice too!A classic that should never be used as a franchise for Jim Carrey and Ron Howard! They would only dump the original attributes of the story and create a bunch of atrocious backstory, plot and silly antics.I didn't like Horton hears a Who very much but it would probably be enjoyed by my kids when I have some so its a good bonus I guess."
2,Warner Bros is the new grinch,"Very disappointing. Color is way off, my grinch is yellow not the green that he should be. Numerous black segments that seem to be where commericals were removed. A real rip off."
4,The movie is 1 star better,"This is not a great cartoon, but a good one. But the cartton shows more the Grinch then the Who's of Whoville. But it is still worth enough to hand over money to buy or rent on video or dvd. I am going to give 4 stars because of of not getting to know the Whos. And little Cindy Lou Who."
3,Dr. Seuss - How the Grinch Stole Christmas/Horton Hears a Wh,I would have given the Dvd a perfect 5 if not for the sound. Why oh why isn't this in stereo. I have heard the whole cartoon on audio and it is in great sounding stereo. Other then that its classic Dr. Seuss.
3,Too bad about the color,"I can't give it a full 5 stars because of the ""mustard"" Grinch.Love the story, hate the color and the audio. At least you don't have to rewind it everytime you get done watching it.I did discover on my tv sets that turning the tint abnomrally toward the green side mostly fixes the color of the Grinch while watching the DVD. Interestingly enough, all the other colors also seem to be ok with this tint setting. Someone really screwed up the color settings when mastering this one...Maybe Horton's color is all wrong too? There's nothing to reference it to except maybe the original book version. ;^)Overall, Christmas with a mustard Grinch is still more fun than going without!"
3,"Not the best, rent it instead.","This is an okay movie, but is not as funny or comedic as the live version. This movie is just your basic ""Grinch hates Christmas so he steals all the presents and the whole thing backfires."" This is still worth seeing, just not spending money on. I mean, the Grinch doesn't even sound funny like in the one with Jim Carrey, and Cindy Lou isn't a main character, either, which [is not fair]. And also, there's no Betty Lou, or Martha May, not to mention Stu and Drew. This is my biggest complaint, you'll find that this movie is 53 minuts because it has Horton Hears a Who on it. If it wasn't for that, than this cassette would only be a half an hour, in simple terms, it is too short! Rent it instead of buying it. Remember, it's still worth seeing, just not spending money on."
5,Dr. Seuss- How the Grinch Stole Christmas,I am pleased with the product. The only thing I was not aware of is that I had to go to the post office to pick this up and sign for it. It was a bit incovnienent during the busy holiday season.
5,Classic!,This is Christmas! Enjoying it every time I see it. A must have for your collection. Re-mastered and cleaned up even better!
3,Grinch,The movie failed to play on my 2012 LG smart TV and LG support said a software update was overdue for release. I was forced to request an immediate refund which was not easy but it was granted.
2,The same great story and songs but a terrible video transfer,"I recently purchased this DVD and was immensely disapointed with the quality of the transfer. The colors were all over he place with the Grinch appearing as a yellow, then brown and finally slightly green creature. The transfer is terrible. I would not recommend it to anyone based upon this poor quality."
3,The colors would make anyone a Grinch!,"I have always loved this classic Dr. Seuss animated film and awaited its arrival with great anticipation. And while the story is as endearing as ever, I am disappointed that the coloring on this transfer is terrible. The backgrounds are garish and too bright and the Grinch is the color of mustard instead of his true green color shown on the front of the case. In addition, the pencil tests are far too few and do not add any value to the disc. It is hard to focus on the splendid attributes of this title because of its few, yet glaring oversights. My advice is to wait for a better transfer to come out, or perhaps seek out the previous version on dvd which may be of better quality."
2,the mustard brown grinch on dvd,"I agree with both Chicago, IL and Boston, Ma reviews. The crystal clear DVD viewing of 'How the Grinch Stole Christmas'was great but, WHY is the grinch not in his true green color! There are other greens in the picture so why not the grinch! Very perplexing we thought and it made the viewing very disappointing. WHAT GIVES! I would highly recommend buying the VHS version due to this disturbing error on the DVD version. I suppose the people who like the DVD version don't realize that the grinch in this version is an impostor! Even when he's green on the DVD cover AND main menu screen!"
4,A Pleasure,"I bought this DVD primarily to get Horton Hears A Who. It has been several years since I have watched this show. I don't even remember how old I was when I first saw this show. It has been maybe 20 years. I was very pleased to see it being sold in the animated version. For me, it brings back a youthful experience. My children have shared in the experience. If you have small children, it may be different for them because of the animation we have today, but they just may enjoy a simple cartoon with a purposeful message.The message seems to be simple; that even little children can make a difference in the world around them. They are needed, no matter how young, or as Horton says, ""...no matter how small"". I'm sure that different people get different messages.It has been wonderful seeing this show again.The Grinch Who Stole Christmas is a definite classic- enduring. Stories like these are just not being told as much anymore."
5,The Grinch Is Super!!,"The Grinch is super! I just love the Grinch. The Grinch is a heart warming Christmas show. I just love the song ""You're A Mean One Mr. Grinch."" I have seen this show tons of times and I am not board with it yet. I even watch it after the Christmas season. The Grinch is perfect for children to watch. It teaches them the true meaning of Christmas."
5,No color problem,"I compared a VHS version and DVD version to check the Grinch's ""color problem"" discribed by some reviewers of this DVD. True, the Grinch is not bright green on the DVD, but I don't think he is supposed to be. I did not see any difference between the VHS and DVD versions of his color, and did not think his color looked wrong at all."
3,"Quality good, color bad/","The video quality of both movies is good. As good as originally broadcast, which was very flat looking compared to today's work. However, the Grinch is the wrong color, dingy yellow, not green. This probably won't affect children seeing it for the first time, but it kind of ruins it for nostalgic watchers."
3,Mixed feelings about this one...,"As much as I love the Grinch and Horton, this DVD had problems. The Grinch is a mustardy-yellow color, Horton is a mess! Thankfully, I got this one cheap, but there really isn't much to this package. I'm glad to have the Grinch, but I wonder if I'll be buying another, better copy down the line..."
5,Great.,Just what I wanted. Love the idea of having it in my video library. I can take it anywhere with me.
5,"Ahhh, memories...","I absolutely love my copy of How the Grinch Stole Christmas and Horton Hears a Who. I did not notice any color variations or strange sound effects, so I'm guessing some people received a bad copy. However, this version is wonderful! I enjoyed reading Dr. Seuss growing up and this movie brings up happy childhood memories of Christmas! This is a great Christmas story for all ages with a good message behind it!"
3,Beware Of Defective DVDs With Incorrect Grinch Color!,"How The Grinch Stole Christmas is an awesome Christmas cartoon and Horton is good too though not as good as The Grinch. If you haven't bought this DVD yet beware of defective DVDs, especially if you are buying it used. beware of discs in which the Grinch is the wrong color and is a mustard brown instead of a light pea green color. The correct color of The Grinch is similar to the color of Kermit The Frog and should not be brown."
5,The Grinch Will Always Be One Of My Favorites...,"How can you not like The Grinch? The story is one of many classics by the undisputed king of word play ""Dr. Seuss"" himself. The songs are the greatest!!! ""You're a foul one, Mr. Grinch, and your soul is full of gunk...There are 3 words that best describe you and I quote...stink, stank, stunk!"" I LOVE IT!!! :o)"
5,The Grinch is a fabulous movie!!,"Enjoyable for everyone, the grinch is brought to life in this wonderful tale of a grouchy old grinch who hates Christmas and ends up liking it. A great movie and something that everyone can enjoy!!!"
5,"Great Book , Great Authors","Taunton puts out great books with great authors, this book is no different. Great layout and information.I can't add much to what was already stated in the earlier reviews except that Kim Carleton Graves was easy to contact through email. He responded quickly, professionally and was very informative.In summary, buy the book you wont be disappointed."
5,A Compliment to any Woodworker's Library,I bought this book to learn about dining table construction.The instructions are clear and concise and includes ALL the steps required to make 9 tables.Kim Carleton Graves is obviously a very good teacher and it really comes across in this book.I found this book a great learning aid and I'm sure I will refer to it time and time again.Please publish a book on chairs.
3,Dining Tables,There are some good projects in the book but there are some pretty significant holes in the directions.I am a relatively experienced woodworker and there are some techniques that he uses that could have used more explanation. He just glosses over too many things
4,Generation XYZ,"primal, infectious rock delivered with great passion. It's awesome to see how Billy and Steve have reinterpreted many of these songs in a way that sheds brilliant light on Stevens' diverse guitar playing and the everlasting appeal of the songs. Check out ""Flamenco.A.Go.Go"" by Steve Stevens for more mystical licks."
4,Billy Idol at his near-best,"A fun, fast-moving live appearance by legendary rock singer Billy Idol, featuring reminiscences intercut with musical performances. If you're a Billy Idol fan, as I am, you'll enjoy this disc a lot. My only complaint is that the sonic quality is not as good as on most of Billy's CDs. I don't know if this is because of recording problems or because the soundtrack on DVDs is compressed to accomodate both audio and video on the same disc, but the lower quality is noticeable on a good system. Still, if you just want to rock out with one of the '80s best performers, this disc is a treat."
5,billy idol,It is great. Steve Stevens is great. I think the crowd was great. The show was great. The audio was great. I think the DVD was great.
5,Billy Idol Kicks Ass!!!!!!,"I saw this storytellers when it aired on VH1, it blew my frickin mind.He sounds better than ever. The sound is excellent, the band is tight and the enegry and,chemistry is frickin wicked. I love the fact there's no big stage not a huge audience it's intimate performance .it's incredible. when it was released on dvd i went out and got it right away. for any billy idol fan this is a must. If you ever thought of Billy idol as just a Mtv Novelty. Watch this Dvd and prepare to be Blown away and admit to yourself ""I was wrong... This guy is The Real Deal.Billy Idol Rocks"" more info got on Billy Idol at his official site:http://www.billyidol.com/"
5,It is Idol-Awsome!,"This is one concert dvd you have to have. If you don't Get it now. Trust me it is alittle expensive but its worth it. I saw him live one his Devils Playground tour in Corpus Christi, and have every single one of his albums. This one is for all Idol fans, and also for every one else. If you have a surroned sound system you will love this more then everyone else loves it. Whatching to one of the 80's Legendary performers you will wet yourself. And, for a big plus Steve Stevens is one this dvd. His guitar licks will leave you speechless. So buy this one and you won't be dissapointed."
2,wrong color,"I am very disappointed. I've been waiting such a bright orange umbrella as the picture. But it was terracotta. I wanted it so long ago, I've been going to buy it, so I waited for it, and I can not even return it because I do not live in the U.S."
3,"Not Bad, Could be better,Brother!","Let me tell you something Brother! This DvD ain't bad for people who like solid wrestling, the matches are all average, no great matches here. No real big names, biggest is probably Kane unmasked.Save your money for a real DVD like Wrestlemania 17, Wrestlemania 18, My good friend Triple H's DvD, and even my 2 Disc DvD which comes out in a few weeks. Nobody cares about Smokey Mountain Wrestling, it's dead, it's gone, much unlike Hulkamania who is Here,Alive!, and still kickin [behind] in 2002! Keep it real Brothers!"
1,The James Conlon Show,"The title of this DVD says it all. It compiles a number of television shows purporting to feature participants in the Twelfth Van Cliburn Piano Competition.There's apparently a lot of beautiful music making here, but unfortunately we're not allowed to hear much of it. Each performances is interrupted after only a few minutes, and at length, by conductor James Conlon and competition adjudicator Menahem Pressler, speaking and thinking great thoughts about philosophy, history and music. If two hours of this sort of thing is your cup of tea then go for it!"
1,Would Never Order Anything Like This Again,"I thought the dishes were beautiful when I saw them on line. However, when I received them at home they were VERY POORLY packed and were broken!!! I am handicapped and it is hard for me to get around. Then, I had to lug this big package to a post office to return them! NEVER ORDER ANYTHING THAT IS BREAKABLE!!!"
3,Good reference,"This book would be good for a reference, however, I would not reccomend it for learning the subject or to supplement a course on fluid mechanics."
4,Great presentation of material.,"Great presentation of material, but does anybody know if there are solutions to the example problems? Always helps me learn when I see how it's done."
4,GREAT READ,I recommend this book to anyone who is already knowledgeable in Fluid Mechanics and wants to expand their knowledge on the subject matter. Ideal for anyone taking a course in a Graduate Fluid Mechanics class or related subject. Overall well written.
5,Awesome smart book,One of the smartest book in the field that made complicate stuff easy to understand
5,a necessary book for working on fluid dynamics,this is really a nice book if you want to work on fluid mechanics. it provides you the equations of fluid mechanics in different coordinate system.
4,Disappointment,The shipping was very poorly done and came in broken. Now I have the hassle to return and request a replacement. How can I be sure that this one will be in good shape since it was a wedding gift.
1,A self-conflicting book.,His speeches are not well organized and are self-conflicting. I hope he can really spend some time studying philosophy and write a better one next time.
4,Mendelsshohn biography,This is an good biography of Mendelssohn but it is mostly geared to the music student. I would not recommend it for a person who does not know music. It critiques his music in detail which interferes somewhat with the flow of the story of his life. It would be excellent as a text book.
3,Just Needed a Little Bit More Substance....,"Although I enjoyed this read and hearing the story of Lorabeth and Cameron's romance, the two characters didn't seem to have the same sense of depth as the main characters in Valiant Bride. In contrast, the two people seem to lack any self-control even though everyone believed they were cousins. I'm glad everything worked for them out in the end, but I wish the two characters had as much depth as Noramary and Duncan. I would have been able to sympathize with them more."
2,Okay. Doesn't live up to other Jane Peart titles.,"I am a big fan of Jane Peart, however, this book was not as good as her others. Attractive Lorabeth flees England to escape the clutches of her dominant mother. She believes in true love and is determined to avoid a hideous arranged marriage. She finds solace and comfort in her grandmother's home, however, I felt the romance between Lorabeth and her first cousin Cameron, to be forced and contrived. The romance didn't develop naturally as in most romance novels. However, I did think the author did well in describing the scenery."
1,Not Suitable for Dogs,"If I had seen this frisbee in a store rather than buying it online, I would never have purchased it for my dog. It's a firm plastic that would hurt my 20-pound terrier if it hit her in the mouth or head. Like another reviewer wrote, it's also the kind of plastic that is likely to crack and be even more dangerous for our pets. This is going directly into the thrift store donations box."
4,SupportMattress,"Initial review very positive with excellent support whether on your back or side. Other products typically lack ventillation and are too hot. Thusfar, that isn't the case with the Ultimate Support Mattress although the real test will be in the summer."
3,Beautiful but Somewhat Unsatisfying,"Nikki Gemmell writes beautifully, and her Bride was someone I grew to like and sympathize with, even though I found it hard to identify with her (maybe because I belong to a later generation, which I think--and hope--is less repressed). I enjoyed most of the book, even when I questioned Bride's decision to stay in an unhappy marriage to a man who most likely cheated on her with her best friend.I won't spoil the ending for the people who haven't yet read the book, but I will say that I found it very unsatisfying. I wish Gemmell would have given us a clue as to what happens to Bride and what made her take that choice."
2,A bizarre foray into the mind of one married woman ...,"This simply-written, frank book allows us into the hidden thoughts of one woman, laying bare a secret life that those closest to her would never imagine she leads.The plot is not original, daring or even erotic, and some key characters are unconvincing. Still, the author uses clever stylistic devices to weave in realism and drama - she writes anonymously, uses a second-person view point, and adds a twist in the peripheral plot where the anonymous author is reported to disappear (the press smoked out the real author eventually).Although disappointing, it is enjoyable as a quirky exploration of the contradictions in married life."
3,literary sex anyone?,"This is a quick read. It's a novel about a woman obsessing on her sexuality in the context of her relationships with her husband, her best friend, her mother, and her lover. I found her unique voice compelling me along, e.g., ""Darkness is greedy now, it crowds into the afternoons. The year is galloping toward Christmas."" Short, clear sentences cover so much territory and get you thinking about life."
4,Striking and thoughtful,"When I saw this book on the shelf of my local bookstore, I actually almost blushed. ""Erotic"" was the key descriptor in almost every review sited on the cover...and I am not normally a fan of erotica literature. But the story sounded just too seductive to pass up. It focuses on a newlywed woman who feels discontented with her new life. Her husband is very plain and business-like, the opposite of her. Despite their happy companionship, they are rarely intimate and she yearns for something more. After meeting a handsome stranger in a local cafe one day, her entire world changes. She comes alive, gets in touch with her sexuality - and the reader anxiously follows her awakening. It's exciting, graphic, and heartbreaking all at once. Her life is not an easy one, but what woman's is? I would highly recommend this book to anyone who's ever been in love, been in lust, or has dreamt about being in either sometime in their life."
4,shockingly honest,"I first heard of this book in an article where the person said that The Bride Stripped Bare was much more shocking than the 50 Shades Trilogy - this comment intrigued me enough to buy it. This book is very shocking and the reason it's so shocking is due to the honesty of the author not because of the detailed sex acts like 50. The book starts with the main character on her honeymoon and is written in a series of 'lessons' that reads much like journal or diary entries. The main character writes what she really thinks and feels which is exactly why the book is so shocking - her comments are things most women have thought of their partners at one time which makes you relate to her but on several occasions she takes her thoughts farther than most of us ever would. This book is an insight into the lives of women including friendships, relationships with parents, children, and of course significant others. It's interesting, honest, and at times sad."
5,Loved it,"I thought this book was beautiful,fascinating, amazing and true. I read the whole thing in one day; I literally could not put it down. I think it's very relevant to our world and will strike a chord in men as well as women. I randomnly picked it out at the bookstore and am so pleased i did. Of all the books I have read it is definetly at the top of my favorites."
1,Don't waste your time,"This book is terrible. I forced myself to finish it, hoping it would get better. No such luck. And the ending is terrible, unfinished."
2,Silly,"Maybe it was all the hype around the expose of Nikki Gemmell as the author, but I had expected this book to be much better.I think the concept of the book was excellent, but Gemmell didn't appear to have the intelligence, erotic experience/imagination or skill as an author to deliver what could have been an intriguing book.The plot is not fully rounded and the characters lack depth - both plot and characters have potential but it is never achieved.A great book if you want an easy holiday read, but don't expect something confronting or groundbreaking - better to go for something like Hollywood Wives which doesn't pretend to be anything other than it is.I think it would have also been cleverer if she had, at some point, either linked back to, or acknowledged, the source of the plagarised title (Brian Ferry Album).My conclusion on reading book was just that it's silly. Nearly as silly as the staged 'discovery' of the author and her pointless disclaimer at the back."
4,Devastating,"I was expecting a titillating, naughty read but got so much more. Most immediately brings to mind 'Looking for Mr. Goodbar' in its devastating depiction of a woman seeking fulfillment through sexual exploration. By the end I was sad, angry and totally enraptured by this haunting story. Look beyond the surface of the 'smut' and you will find so much more."
4,"A very strange book, I haven't decided if I like it.","The layout if very odd, it took some getting used to. By the third ""lesson"" I figured I was done. It wasn't making any sense and I just didn't have the time or energy to plod through it. I picked it up again about a week later and read it all the way through in one night.I said that I still haven't decided it I like it and that is true. It is very well written and quite a moving story. I just don't know if I personally wanted to be ""moved"" in quite that way. It can be very graphic at times, much more graphic than any other standard erotic romance novel. I understand how it was necessary and pertinent to the storytelling and thus was not offended by it, but I guess it made me think about things that I just don't think about. I imagine (based on the Q&A; in the appendix of the paperback version) that that was the author's goal. Well done."
2,Not what I expected,Was a slow read and not as intriguing as online synopsis it seem. Will not be ordering book 2 to the series
3,Not too bad,"Took a long time to get into, not sure if I would recommend, although having said that just as it wasn't my cup of tea it could be someone else's."
2,"Tired story, but cool Mummies!","Katie Macalister has a ton of fans, so I'm thinking that maybe this book just wasn't for me. I'm a fan of the Anita Blake series, Mary Janice Davidson and Michelle Rowan so I though, hey let's give Sex Lies and Vampires a try.I finished the whole book, but I couldn't get into it. There were some really great parts-- Mummies etc. Macalister can be terribly funny. The problem lies in the repitition and the dialouge. The characters seem empty and the story tended to repeat itself a lot. They spent a LOT of time traveling from one place to the next. Every couple chapters there was a ""on the train"" scene. AUGH!Anyway, a gagillion fans can't be wrong-- Macalister is doing something right, and there is no denying she's a gifted writer... the story just wasn't for me."
3,a little angsty but still fun to read,"The Dark Ones seem to be hit and miss with me. Some are great fun to read, others seem to drag. This one sits in the middle."
1,Waste of time,This book is inane and stupid. I would advise everyone who has an IQ over room temperature to avoid buying or reading this book. The heroine is a complete ditz with whom you will be unable to develop any empathy. This book continually lacks a reasoned plot. This should be at the bottom of the bargain bin.
3,it was pretty good,"I prefered this one over the last one of the Dark Series she wrote. It drives me crazy how much of a knock off this is from other vampire books, though.I thought this one had more of a plot. There was a problem to solve and the characters made an effort to solve it. It still a pretty mindless book, but even mindless books have their place."
3,"fun, wacky, naughty but a little bit underdone","As always Katie Macalister never fails to make me laugh. I hope she'll never lose her sense of humor which I always love about her writing style. I had a good laugh reading this book! The problem I have about this book is she did not describe more about Nell Harris. I know she has left sided hemiplegia, a charmer in denial, boobsy and tall, but then what? I do like Adrian though, alot! Nell and Adrian are suited for each other forever! There nothing more romantic than saving the one you love from eternal damnation!But I really hate his son Damian, what an ungrateful brat! Im looking forward to read about Sebastian. I wonder what his story is, hope Nell and Adrian will make an appearance in Just One Sip. Wish Katie will describe more in detail about her main characters and more about the world of the Dark Ones."
2,I wanted to give more stars -- really I did,"I've enjoyed the rest of this series. The Dark Ones are a funny take on another as well known series that is mentioned by titled. The humor is cute as button, we have a herione that you would love to have to tea. A very short tea.Here's the problem. The characters don't seem to actually be IN the story. Our narrator seems to be narrating from four or five steps back and never quite clicks with anythingHumor is reached for, a little too hard - case in point - the mummies.This seems to have been dashed off to make a deadline or fill a contract, the real passion and fun in the other two books of this series are just not there."
1,"Lame, in both characters and plot","I like Corset Diaries and I love the horror and sci-fi genres so perhaps that is why I did not like this book. Her characters, as in many of her books, are flat, lacking in depth and vapid. They have very little going on in their lives, or at least they certainly do not mention anything approaching real here, nor do they develop personalities during the book. The plot was nearly non-existent and the vampires were unimpressive. If you want to read a real vampire book check the real horror section. If you want romance from this author try Corset Diaries or Men in Kilts and skip all the rest.I wish someone had shared this with me before I picked up Diaries, loved it and kept trying to find another gem in MacAlister's other books. I did not find one, other than Kilts, I am sorry to say."
2,"Scarred Lands, Flawed Stories","I had high hopes for this collection, since the setting is wonderfully rich and evocative. Unfortunately, the stories of this anthology all fall far short of their potential. It is sad to say that the best of the stories in this volume are all the most humorous ones. The ones that attempt tragedy or drama all fall woefully short, and are, often, painfully cliche.Add this to the ABYSMAL editing (The same word was mispelled no less than three times, in the same way, in three different stories, the font size changes from story to story, and the grammer in some of the tales is terrible.)and the end product is not terribly satisfying.All in all, this book was actually painful to try and finish."
5,simply amazing,"simply put, this is an amazing mix by PVD. This is the style and sound thta has brought him to where he is today and never dissapoints. An excellent track selection that is not found on other DJ mixes, which is great."
5,Good Mix from Van Dyk,"This CD represents a good mix from Paul Van Dyk. While I have come to expect a more hard hitting experience from Van Dyk productions, this CD really hits the spot. There are about three areas within the CD that leave you with a warm and euphoric feeling. There is also good flow throughout the CD.As someone who owns several Van Dyk CD's, this one will not disappoint!"
3,Okay,"This album was decent, track selection was decent and the mixing could have been better. The previous reviewer was right about the compilation that PVD did not mix this. This CD is way overpriced and you can experience the best of PVD with Politics of Dancing at way lower price."
3,Great design..but quality is terrible,"First thing you'll notice about this watch is its incredible weight. It's super light compared to those big clunky stainless steel watches. I had this watch for over 5 years, and I got scratches on the crystal from normal use. So don't expect this thing to be completely scratch resistant.Well the low ratings has to due with the poor service and build quality. The ""chrome indicators"" that mark the hours actually came loose inside my watch. I sent it to Skagen under their lifetime warranty to repair it. Guess what, it happed THREE times already...same exact problem. I've spent over 30$ just shipping the watch back and forth.Again, I really like the watch, but the problems with things falling out, and poor repair service, I can only rate this watch a 3 star."
4,"Affordable, elegant, accurate","I've owned this watch for about two months now, and have very few complaints.Contrary to the information in some of the other reviews that caused me some concern before my purchase, I've actually dinged the crystal a couple of times without any evidence of damage whatsoever. I've knocked the face of the watch on pieces of glass (reaching out the window of my car), a table, and a desk, and you can't tell there was any trauma to the watch.It's a great watch that goes with a wide variety of wardrobe pieces, from suits to casual. And importantly, in two months it has been accurate to within a minute.The minor complaints? The font of the date is a little hard to read, the dark face can make it difficult to read the time in low light, and the knob to adjust the date and time is hard to pull out while wearing it."
2,Quality is Below Par,"This is my third Skagen watch. It's quality is far below the other two which, by the way, were significantly less expensive.The band is a total pain to re-size and has an unfinished, rough-edged feel. Can't return under Amazon's watch policy or I surely would.Stick with a model with a woven or leather band and you'll be far more satisfied."
4,Nice Xmas Gift,"Received this as christmas present, very nice and very thing. However I can't figure out how to readjust the size of the band yet."
3,Not a durable watch,This watch is thin an light which I really like. The glass has already cracked in less than 6 months of normal wear. I got it repaired which cost over 40$ with shipping and a moth later it cracked again! I have never had a watch this fragile before.
4,Fine watch,"Nice watch, the only 2 things I am not a huge fan of is: its ticking is pretty loud, and the day displayer can be annoying to synch with time.Very light weight, and stylish."
4,Stylish and Lightweight but...,"On the positive side, this is a very lightweight watch and most of the time I don't even realize I have it on, it also has a very stylish look and I think you can be proud to wear it on the job, on the golf course or out on the town. Let's face it as Men, we don't wear much jewelry and so I think it's important to make a good choice with your watches. On the negative side, the calender date is too small for almost anyone to see, the adjustment knob is very hard to pull out, and the clasp sticks out a little even when it's closed. But all in all it's a great watch for the price. One last thing, having the band adjusted should cost $5 to $10 and make sure they take links from both sides."
3,"Classic, elegand and light, but easy to brake","I had those watches for close to two years. Got them because I like the styling, size, color and pretty much everything about it. I'd say those are perfect EXCEPT:1) Supposedly they are water resistant but they fogged up after the first time I got into shower.. the was not intentional and it was during the first week I had them.2) Crystal is very easy to scratch.3) Titanium band and watch body are also very to scratch.4) Titanium bracelet broke after less than two years...:) So I'm looking for a new watch now... I'd go for the same model, but it's just not tough enough for everyday life. Too bad!"
4,Ultralight and handsome,"Because it is made of titanium, it is ultralight and thin. The watch is very handsome. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because you cannot tell the time at night or in the dark at all. For the price for a titanium watch though, it is a great purchase."
4,"Great watch, though a few problems.","The watch is fantastic. I've had it for about six months now and it's still in pretty good shape. It's the lightest metal-banded watch I've owned, almost as light as the cheapo plastic-banded ones. The ticking is a bit loud in a quiet room at night, but it's certainly nowhere near the loudest watch I've owned.There are two problems with it, though. The matte finish on several of the links has started to give way to the glossy underlayers. This is, however, only noticable from less than half a foot away. The other problem is the latch. Because it doesn't have a counter-locking mechanism like most other metal watch bands, it comes open every now and then when making sudden movements like clapping. This happens very sparingly though, maybe once every several weeks.Overall, it's a good buy, especially at the prices on Amazon (I got mine in a real-life store for list price)."
4,skagen Titanium Watch,"Bought this for my husband-great watch. However, we had to take to a jeweler to remove links. Lightweight-goes with everything."
4,"Very nice, comfortable watch","This watch is very thin and light, I bought it for my boyfriend who had never worn a watch and he likes it a lot. So many mens watches are so heavy, this one is a welcome change. The picture is a little off, the color is much lighter than the photo, but I think it looks much nicer in person. The only reason I didn't give this watch a 5 is because apparently this type of link is hard to take out, and I had a hard time finding a place that would even touch it because they were afraid they'd ruin it. The jeweler that ended up doing it for us scratched the links and didn't close them correctly. So if you get this watch sized, i would make sure that the jeweler is sure they won't hurt it. Overall, the most attractive, comfortable men's watch I've ever seen."
2,My cheap Timex watch works better.,I bought this model because it looks great. I paid $100 for it from one of the department stores. From the day I bought it the watch has lost about 10 to 15 minutes a day. I thought it was the battery so I replaced it for $10 but that didn't help. In order to get it repaired I had to send it to them via special delivery which cost me $12 more. I checked my mail today and they sent me a letter asking for $8.95 for the cost of repairs or else I won't get the watch back. I'm trying to figure out why I'm being asked to pay for repairs for a watch that is clearly under warranty. I'll be calling them tomorow to find out. In the meantime.. don't buy a Skagen watch unless you like cheap junk and lousy service.
3,forget the date indicator,"As have others, I have enjoyed the design and weight. Fortunately, mine seems sturdier than others have found. However, the date indicator is not only too tiny to read easily, but it rarely is accurate, no matter how many times I correct it within the same month."
2,The watch appearance is not the same as the photo,"The watch color does not correspond exacrly to the web photo.The case and bracelet is in fact graphite color and not steel, as it appears in the photo."
3,"Yep, it's one of the feel good, look great watch, but it was not built to last","I love the way the watch looks and feel, but it was not built to last. The indicators mark did come loose inside the watch. I sent it to Skagen to get it repaired for $30."
1,Bah... never received it,"Yep, I ordered this magazine a few months back and never received one single issue. Lame."
5,sharp,Like having a mini tool box on your hip. My second one. Sharp as can be! I'm a big fan of Buck Knives. Carried one for 40 years. Never a dud!
4,Immersion blender,This immersion blender is very powerful...the only thing that I dislike about it is that there is only one speed and you must hold the button down to make it work. It makes it awkward to hold the container and the button down while moving the blender around inside the container.
5,Great Replacement Part,This Receptacle was easy to replace & a OEM part so nothing had to be retrofitted to make it work. A great product.
5,Great old movie,This is a great movie dubbed in at least 10 languages (that I know of). Another person rated it as 1 only because it was not the version he was expecting and apparently didn't watch it at all. Saying that this is a bad movie would be equal to saying that all black and white movies are bad. Visit website Ruscico.com for classic russian movies and for the list of special features on this DVD.
4,Good moovie,"I saw this film 30 years ago, and after reading review of of the man ,who got it insted of Disney version, I decided to see this film one more time. My opinion- If you order cheesburger and insted they send you bottle of vodka, it doesn't make vodka bad, inspite of your disappointment.I found this film better then british version(with Orson Wells as John Silver), it is more accurate to the book, and it is is very important to the ""Tresure Island"" buffs. And Boris Andreev as Silver much more believebel then Orson Wells (I didn't see Disney version of the book) It is a pretty seemly film. I didnt see the DVD But I know that RUSSICO company made perfect copys."
4,Soviet Cinema Classic,"This film is a 1971 Rissian version of Stevenson's classic ""Treasure Island."" This classic was filmed in Soviet cinema three times (1931, 1971, and 1982) each one with a slightly different flavor. Keeping in mind the tight budget and limited resources that these filmmakers had, this movie is particulatly well done. The DVD is a masterpiece in itself as it offers 3 fully dubbed versions of the film in 5.1 Dolby Digital sound (Russian 5.1, English 5.1, French 5.1). It even offers the menus in these 3 languages. In addition, the subtitles are privided in 11 languages (including German, Spanish, Arabic, Hebrew, Japanese, etc.) The dubbing for the film is done really well, which often makes one forget that this is a foreign film. Unlike the Disney versions, Russian and European versions of classics like this one tend to stay much more true to the book. This film is a nice example of Soviet cinema and is a must see for anyone interested in foreign films."
3,"Good fun, but not a classic","This is the russion version of the classic story, and one can tell. Things aren't quite as high budget but overall, it is pretty good. The main thing that I didn't like was that many of the transitions in the story were rather abrupt. Now the story isn't too complex, but it still takes away from the movie."
2,Doesn't have the same fragrance as other my wife had.,I won't buy perfume again online. I am not certain that this was the real thing but for some reason the fragrance was not the same as the original purchased at a department store.
2,My Opinion,Not for me!! This Eau De Parfun smells so good on other people but not on me. So this is thumbs down!!
3,It's ok,It smells a lot lighter than the ones I buy in stores.I have to use more of this to smell it.
2,Too dated (-89),"Even though this is quite a workout, it is obvious that this video was made in -89. I would recommend something newer as this video is not very pleasant to follow and doesn't do much for motivating you."
3,Not MZB's best,"Scholar Cendri and her husband, Master Scholar Dal, come to the xenophobic planet of Isis/Cinderella. Because this planet has a very strict matriarchal society, Cendri poses as the master scholar while Dal is relegated to the role of her possession and assistant. They are nominally there to study what may be ruins from the race that seeded the galaxy, but while there they find that their own assumptions about gender and power are called heavily into question.I'd like to stress that this isn't a bad book, and MZB completists will certainly not regret reading it, but the ideas that are sketched out here are developed more fully and with much more grace in both the Darkover and Avalon books. The gender politics come over a little bit too heavy-handed and occasionally make it difficult to focus on the plot."
1,"Sadly, I couldn't finish it","I started this book with high hopes, since a friend loaned it to me and recommended it highly. However, I had to force myself to keep picking it up. The historical information is overwhelming, the characters are not anyone you care about, the underwater city, the monks, the pope's wish to be associated with a grey beast instead of a lion, etc. etc. is just too overwritten. Finally, I put it down never to pick up again... this is probably only the third book I have ever done this with!"
4,Fable for grown ups with a taste for the unusual,"There is another review of this book which points out that this is not a book for high school kids. Very true. But if you have a hankering for a book outside of the normal formulaic mainstream, this is definitely worth a try. The plot is atypical, wide ranging and will make you think; but the language is often intoxicating once you have the measure of it - like Wilde it has rhythym and flow and can be wonderful read aloud. So if you like the premise of an offbeat and often hilarious tale of Renaissance foibles and morality and feel like an Eco-esce read, GO FOR IT"
2,Dense,"I mean dense. I have to say that I was really disappointed with TPR. The text is a swirl and the movement of characters and action tangential and murky. In short, unless you are the type of reader that likes to read between the lines (a lot!) then I'd counsel you to keep looking. If you thrist for historical fiction try The Instance of the Fingerpost."
1,Where are we now?,"OK! I thought by the synopsis on the dustjacket that it was to be a Umberto Eco's style book.... Well! Yes but without the genius of it! An overflow of intricates details that go nowhere. Read the first half of it and dropped it there. I do crave for those complicated historically-mystery novel but I got my Dead end here! PLEASE don,t waste any money nor time trying to read this... Doesn't worth it... It seemed promising by the end of the first section but by the end of the second you get fed-up by the meaning of all this...Even after over 3 weeks that I put back this book on the shelf, I not too sure to understand where the author wanted to go with the 2 first parts.Stay with Eco not with Norfolk... at least not fot this one. (It was my first novel by him; and I'm not too sure if I want to try another one!)"
1,caveat emptor,"not only did i find this book torturous, exasperatingly arrogant, and witheringly overdone, i met lawrence norfolk a few days ago, and i assure you, fellow readers, he has no soul. writing as capitalism. ick. read annie proulx. she has soul. dont give your money to mr. norfolk."
1,Try -Silvio Bedini's The Pope's Elephant- instead,"I agree with the other reviewers who gave The Pope's Rhinocerous one star. The writing is unpleasant, pompous, and inflated, making it almost embarrassing to read. I finished chapter one but could stomach no more. I do recommend a modest alternative though: Silvio Bedini's The Pope's Elephant, which relates a wealth of facts and a few enjoyable anecdotes about Hanno the elephant. It includes a chapter about a rhinocerous."
3,If the Second Half Was Only as Good as the First...,"I agree in varying degrees with most of the other readers' comments about this book. I found the first half to be challenging, lush, entertaining, gripping, etc. and was looking forward to 600 pages just like it. But once the author got through the first two sections of the book, everything began to wander. The extreme versimilitude of the first half jarred with the growing elements of fantasy (magic realism?) which began to intrude in Roma, and by the time the scene shifted to West Africa, the author had lost me. If you want an analogy, I found the first half of the book to be a richly woven tapestry, well worth scrutiny, while the second half unraveled and became almost unintelligible. I was ultimately disappointed, the more so because of the early promise of the book. Maybe in the future? I'll be watching..."
2,Is This Monteverdi ?,"This title is one I purchased because I thought that any version of a Monteverdi opera would be worth having. I was mistaken and I think that the scoring and playing is probably the main flaw though the vocal performances are also flawed. You may not be a renaissance buff, but I think that almost anyone will agree that the apparently continuous use of winds, especially brass, and percussion along with wide vibrato and sloppy singing in the voices does not do Monteverdi justice. The story is, of course, the return of Ulysses to his home on Ithaca as told in the Odyssey. I found little to recommend this production except as the only available video of this opera."
4,"Surprising, and on good paper","This anthology is surprising in that it's not just a fine selection, but the notes are useful. It's printed on good paper as well. I miss a couple of old favorites, but overall, it's a book of poems I actually pick up and read from time to time. More than worth the price."
4,A Good Collection,"This book is a treasure in most respects. It is a collection of the one hundred most popular poems, chosen by the frequency of inclusion in anthologies. The span goes from medieval poetry up to the 20th century, and classics such as Shakespeare's sonnets and ""Kubla Khan"" share space with lesser-known gems such as ""With Rue My Heart is Laden."" Except for one or two, the poems are all family-friendly and a good accompaniment to an audiobook. (We have one from Norton, the poem selection is very similar.)My only complaint is with the editor's poem introductions. Some contain fascinating biographical tidbits, but others are not as good, including a far-fetched comparison between ""Annabel Lee"" and Lolita. This should not be a problem as long as parents read the book first and know which paragraphs to skim."
3,Smaller Than Expected,"This pie pan is supposed to be 8 inches, but it actually fits inside an 8 inch pan. Also, it is very lightweight. However, we did make a mince meat pie in it, and the pie did turn out fine....just small."
5,condom sense,"This should be required reading for everyone, it is very easy to read, entertaining, and very informative. This book is good for all ages I hope the authors will translate it into spanish.Maria"
3,It works.,"I purchased this double jogging stoller rain cover for my double BOB stoller.It is a lot cheaper than the BOB cover (which costs about $50). Obviously it isn'tthe same quality as the BOB cover, but for 13$ with free shipping, it can't be beat.It covers all parts of the stroller, and velcros in nicely around the front wheel.I figure, if the weather is bad enough to justify the heavy duty BOB cover, I won't be outin it anyway! This cover is just fine for the light sprinkles I'll be out in.Plus it comes with a bag to store it in which is a nice addition!"
3,It's okay,"The other reviews of this album say that it's the best recording. I wouldn't say that. Some also say that they don't like the voices of Munkustrap, Rum Tum Tugger, and Mungojerrie. But to be perfectly honest, they are sometimes the strongest. Munkustrap and Rum Tum tugger are excellcent all the way through and I think Mungojerrie's character voice fits in fine with his song. Other voice are not as strong. Just listen to the solos in Jellice Songs for Jellice Cats and you'll understand. The worst being Jellylorum. She out right ruins Gus the Theatre cat. I know that sounds mean, but that was one of my favorite songs but now I skip it everytime I come to it. I prefer the first CD over the second. The band is fresh but sometimes is gets fast, The Jellice ball, and they don't do some of the cool percussion things heard on the Broadway cd. I would definatly get the Broadway CD first."
5,"""Cats"" : The memory contiues to live again!!","Cats: The Australian cast, is a very good cd. The cast is good, the music has been re-created and this is ONLY the cd that contains every one of the shows songs.Every song here is sung very well and the music is good too.The voice that really stood out the most was Debbie Bryne as Grizabella. She really made the song ""Memory"" her's, by her lovely voice!I recommend this cd to all CATS fans and let the memory live again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"Good,but tends to be a bit""cartoony'at times","this is a good recording of CATS,but some of the songs tend to get a bit""cartoony'at times.Take""Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer"",for instance-Mungojerrie sounds like some sort of retro-cartoon animal from TV;listen carefully to""We are higlhy efficent cat burglars as well""-doesn't he sound like Quisp?In ""Growltiger's Last Stand"",the Siamese sound like their voices came from some sort of kids' Playstation game.""Memory""was moving and haunting.""Pekes&Pollicles""was good,except the barking sounded like dogs barking on a video game.i love""Gumbie Cat""and""Mr.Mistoffelees.""""Rum Tum Tugger""was better than the Broadway version,and ""Jellicle songs""was lively and outstanding.If you're a die-hard CATS fan,this Cd's for you.If you're the kind of CATs fan who doesn't care for Jellicles sounding like retro-cartoon or video game characters,then I don't recommond this CD."
1,this is pure toxic waste,please never put this item back in stock or print again.....see if the nuclear regulatory comission will dispose of it somehow.
5,Running with Scissors: A Memoir,"I loved this book. I have read it numerous times and I still Laugh my butt off. Way better than the movie, but the movie does hold it's own. I look forward to reading this book for years to come."
3,?,"talk about WEIRD childhood....reading this book left me blank....i don't know if i hate it or love it.....this is weird because i usually feel strongly one way or another....i guess that what makes this book controversial....i am going to watch the movie and see how the director ""sees"" the book.....i am sure it will be interesting to watch."
2,Not what I expected...and not in a good way IMO,"I picked this up at a local target and WOW!IMO, the reviews on the back really candy-coat what is inside.Those reviews, and some read here, do nothing but confirm to me we have gone off the deep-end as a society when we talk of parents/adults abusing children and pedophiles raping adolescents ...using such terms as ""Disturbingly Hilariously"", ""Irreverant"", etc...While I acknowledge such terms are most likely not used to describe the abuse portions, I still think something is wrong when we mentally shutout such and rather defer to ""wacky, ackward"" moments used to lighten up the storyline.This story puts the ""D"" in dysfunctional."
2,Definitely over-sensationalized book...not worth the money,"I was hoping for a great memoir when I got this book but was greatly disappointed by chapter 5. I still had not found anything that made this book worth all the hype. Lots of childish material and misery-loves-company stories fill this book. Augusten definitely finds comfort in his role as a victim of society, molestation, family dysfunction, and just about every other form of abuse and/or disordered relationships you can imagine. I found the book only mildly interesting for the craziness of his upbringing, but the rest was very slow going. Not a memorable memoir."
3,Don't waste your money or your time reading it.,"I bought the book because of what reviews included on the back cover which state ""hilarious...""funny"". There is nothing funny in it. In fact, this is the first time I have been deceived in this manner, and I read alot. I can't even imagine why anybody would want to make movie inspired in this book. It's gross and vulgar."
4,"Good book, not really a comedy","Well written, and very interesting book. The author has a great level of observation of little details of people's behavior and dress. However, I didn't think it was as much of a comedy as some have described it; perhaps this is because my mother is severely mentally ill and many of the situations he decribed were eerily familiar.I did, however, stay up all night reading it, couldn't put it down."
1,Hilarious?,I am deeply disturbed that so many people found this book to be funny. Since when is parental neglect and sexual abuse funny? This book is proof on how social services is failing the children of this country. This book is a cry for help. Thank heavens enough people find pain and suffering funny enough to buy this book in order for Mr Burroughs to afford a good therapist.
2,"Good writing, yet reaches too hard for raunch","When I saw the comparisons to David Sedaris I thought I would love this book. A lot of it is witty and well worded, but at times the author seems to want the shock factor more than the story. Some disgusting details could have been left to the imagination."
1,"Distasteful, repulsive","Wow, I couldn't even make it through half the book! The sexual scenes were too much for me to handle! I kept looking at the cover thinking I must have bought ""a-look-a-like"" book.I'm confused - IS THIS THE BOOK THAT GOT SUCH GREAT REVIEWS??? WHAT?It is very disturbing...who would want to write about such graphic things? And, better yet, who finds pleasure in reading them??? Memoir or not, I don't think that it deserves credit because the author ""survived"" such a horrible chidlhood, like some other reviews suggested.Spend your money elsewhere!"
1,running with narrative,"Long winded and boring book. Central character very unappealing and has a rather condescending distance to the real people around him who are in real pain, as opposed to the caricatures he writes down. Could have been great, a real dud."
1,Pathetic,"What a sad and pathetic story--to attempt to make humor out of such horrendous abuse is a twisted take on this bit of ""reality."" It was a quick and at times engaging read, but I was left feeling sorry for the wasted lives in this story and anger at whatever adults may have allowed this through-the-rabbit-hole little world to have percolated along as it did."
1,"Garbage in, garbage out.","Okay the author had a disturbing, insane childhood. But some of his explicit details of his early sexual encounters were sickening. Too bad because he has talent as a writer, he just chose to write about garbage. His mother may have thought she was another Anne Sexton but this guy thinks he's David Sedaris."
3,Hmmm...,"This book was something else. Stupid me, in the beginning I didn't realize that it was a true story but putting two and two together (the name of the character, same as author) I started to become slightly interested in this book. If it was a made up story I would definitely question the author's character. Basically, the story is surrounded around this young boy and his crazy life. You find out he is gay and aquires a boyfriend twice his age. I could of done with out some of the explicit scences but it is his life story. The only thing about this book that kept me reading until the end its the utter absurd events of this boy's life. Curiousity may get you to buy and read this book but its not on my recommendation list."
2,Depressing at best,"I'm a HUGE David Sedaris fan, and at book readings, he's singled out Augusten Burroughs as an up and coming talent. I must be missing something. This was painful to finish. There is no humor here. There's no uplifting ending, where Auguesten rises above the challenge to great heights. There's just...a large group of charachters for which I felt no sympathy.Mr. Burroughs, please give me my time back."
2,Cat Abuse,"I love animals, and I started to love this book, but there was one story inside of extreme animal abuse, that took this book from a 5 star to a 2 star. I just can't handle descriptions of abusing animals, even though that is what really happened, sickened me."
2,Running With Scissors: A Brand Name,"This book is not terrible, but it is far from good. Instead of using words, the author seems to rely on mentioning brand names, tv shows, and other nostalgia in order to evoke emotion in the reader. In the first 60 pages alone, the author mentions perhaps 30 different brand names, ""Sanka, Oscar Mayer, More cigarettes, Buick, Dodge, Coke, Mr. Coffee, Kleenex...."" This book seems almost focused more upon product placement than on any story line. I give this book two out of five stars, only because I reserve the one star grade for books that are written by the Gap jeans wearing Anne Coulter."
1,Will someone please point out a single funny sentence?,"Not only did I not laugh, I didn't find anything in this book even remotely amusing. And, after re-reading the reviewers on the back cover (GQ, Entertainment Weekly, San Francisco Chronicle, Boston Herald, etc), I should have known to take what has been touted about this book with a grain of salt. I guarantee that much of this book was,if not completely fabricated, greatly exaggerated. The author is habitually smoking marijuana throughout the book, making his memories suspect at best. If your IQ is average or above, you will not enjoy this ""memoir""."
2,Disappointing...,"I approached Running With Scissors with excitement. The David Sedaris comparisons convinced me to try it, and, I'm afraid, may have eventually caused me to dsilike it.It is true that Augusten Burroughs had a bizarre and difficult childhood. I wil not deny that the stories he tells about growing up gay in a cult-like atmosphere are both harrowing and, at times, amusing. What I could not bear, however, was the overall tone of Burroughs' memoir.Running With Scissors, to me, seemed to be a somewhat derivative attempt to write like Sedaris and his ilk that has not entirely succeeded. Where Burroughs' peers write in a light and self-effacing way, his prose is self-aggrandizing and overly self-conscious.The story is interesting, but the pretension in the voice is too much to bear."
3,"Strange, strange book","I thought this to be a very strange book. To live a life such as this and later to later tell the world about it is so typical of society today. Nothing is secret any more. Everything is on display and to be commented on or ridiculed by the general public. I grew up in a time where you didn't air your dirty laundry; your family life was private. I suppose if you can do so and make the world laugh about it makes you a better person? Maybe, but I guess I will never know. It was easily read, that much I will say for this book and at points I did smile but mostly I felt sorry for the characters in the story."
3,Sad book. Could have had a better developed story line,"Reading the book opens your eyes to Afghanistan, but the book's storyline shrouds the violence and anger which seems to be pervasive. It does not want to deal with them. There is a cowboy mentality to the problems which this book unearths.Pretty obvious the guy has lived in the States.Skip the book, stick with the movie!"
5,Highly Enjoyable Read,Once I started reading this book I couldn't put it down though I did read particularly hilarious and disturbing sections aloud to my roomate. Augusten Burrough's story is over the top and yet remarkably frank (about all things including bodily functions). I had more fun reading this book than any book in a long time. Burrough's world is so vivid that I completely forgot about mine.
4,Hilariously disfunctional,"If you ever wondered how disfunctional your family really is........read this book. You will feel wonderful about all the quirks, idiosynchracies, bad habits and insane goings on in your own family. This book is very entertaining. The visions are hysterical. Great reading."
4,Certainly Isn't Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood,"If even just half of the instances in Mr. Burroughs' book are true, none of these characters should ever raise children until they get their acts together. The story is funny, very quirky, extremely disturbing and labeling these people as excessively dysfunctional is putting it waaaaaaaay too mildly. The book will not give you any warm fuzzies, that's for sure. If it does, you need psychiatric help. Mr. Burroughs is a wonderful writer with excellent comic timing. But please be warned, some of this stuff is brutal and troubling to the point of almost making me ill. Talking with someone who works with such families, these kind of idiosyncratic qualities are not that uncommon. Well worth reading, but be prepared."
2,Why do people think this is funny?,"I read this book thinking it would be a funny look at a crazy life, since that was what every review I read had to say about it. I found the book neither funny, nor entertaining. First off, the book was very hard to believe, could anything be this crazy? It seemed like it was embellished quite a bit. It is quite possibly not, but that brings me to the next problem, the writing style. Burroughs only has an elementary school education, and it shows.I read this book for a book club, otherwise I wouldn't have finished it, it just wasn't compeling enough to hold my attention."
1,Awful,"I bought this book for my husband for Christmas because the reviews were so good. I was shocked by the content and I didn't think I was that easily shocked. Both my husband and I think this book is awful. Don't buy it, I will give you our copy."
3,A Disastrous Success,"I have never read a book more bizarre than Augusten Burroughs's, Running with Scissors. I confess that when I first started reading the book, I was quite appalled at some of the vulgar content and events that Burroughs endures. When I finished the book I was left much more open minded. The story is about the memories of an adolescent boy whose psychotic mother gives him away to be raised by her abnormal, unorthodox psychiatrist where he develops a relationship with a pedophile and becomes a chain-smoker by the age of thirteen. Despite the tragic events in this fast-paced, twisted novel, it eventually leads to a satisfying ending. It was interesting, and at times, unpleasant, but I would definitely recommend this book to a mature audience."
1,wish i could give it zero,"This book is trash. I couldn't read anymore of it and literally threw it in the trashcan. If you want to read a truly believable memoir, one that is above and beyond way better than this book, read the Glass Castle."
1,Trash posturing as a true story.,"A disfunctional family that lives in filth and excrement. A line or two may be funny, but a normal reader would perhaps miss them in the miasma. A waste of time reading about wasted lives. There may be some truths in Burrough's memoir, but I believe that most of it is just his mind play."
1,Fiction,"Running with Scissors ranks right up there with A Million Pieces as a work of fiction. Though the basic outline of this book could be true, the author seems to have a very vivid imagination in creating both the characters and the plot. This book is disgusting."
2,A sad memoir,"As a therapist who works with children and adolescents, I couldn't help feeling sad for Augusten Burroughs's adolescent experiences. I didn't find the book funny or entertaining. I think the adults in his life failed him and exploited him. This book is just another depressing tale of a dysfunctional family life experience."
4,What a crazy life !,"Unbelievable true story of the author's childhood. The first two chapters I was in stitches laughing over the absurdities. As the story progresses the characters and the author's surroundings become even more bizare. Almost unimagineable. Read it, you'll be amazed at the story. This book is not funny, unless you have a warped sense of humor - then, it may be funny. It's very serious, and some of the worse things you hope your own children never experiences, are experienced by this brilliant author who triumphed over his lack of discipline and parenting to see his future as an author."
5,The Best Book! Soooo Entertaining and FUNNY!,"I read this book and was sad that it ended! It was the most bizarre, entertaining, twisted and funny book I have ever read! I am going to the bookstore tonight to get all of Burroughs books! DO NOT read if you do not care for sex, homosexuality and very unusual ways of thinking....not a book for the prude! I LOVED every minute of it! 5 stars all the way! Well written and extremely creative!"
2,"Tragicomic, minus the comic","I love the work of David Sedaris and similar 'tragicomic' authors and memoirists. We can find in their brave ability to laugh at the horror of what they've endured, some hopeful statement about the absurd nature of the human condition.I read this book in one sitting and, having done so, I didn't feel a bit like ""wow that's some zany stuff"" rather i felt very sad. Forced attentions from a man double his age, dropping out of school, tons of cigarettes, examination of feces -- it was simply too believable, too real, too harsh.So, in this, I say this is a tragic book told with a survival-required sense of detachment, it's not detached because it's funny, it's detached because the world is so cruel.That said, for other survivors of abuse this may be a great read to find a kindred spirit."
3,Whoa!,"I wanted to like this book. It came highly recommended and I'm currently reading a lot of memoirs...but this came off more like fiction. Perhaps since I couldn't wrap my brain around some of the author's stories I was internally hoping this was the fictional account of a life rather than the memory of a life. The author is the victim of some terrible, terrible abuse and I wasn't prepared to read about such explicit sexual trauma. Amazingly he survives to tell the story. He tells it well, but it was a story I didn't need to experience."
1,How can this book be getting 5 star ratings?,"I read this on a plane, and have rarely felt so dissapointed in a book.I have only read a couple of books that I didn't want to give to charity because I pitied the poor soul who'd pick it up and read it, this was one.I have heard the author compared to David Sedaris, which I think is completely innacurate and a blow to David Sedaris. I REALLY like Sedaris, I did not like this at all. It was listed as comic, I think I cracked a smile once during my read. I don't mind sexual content, I did think this went over the top in explicitness but I've read worse and not found it quite so unpalatable. For me what made this book memorable is how unpleasant it was... I cannot think of one person I know who would like it.. I'm really surprised that so many people have liked it.I'm not surprised that they made a movie of it, but that's another story."
1,Judyblue,"I bought this book because of various reviews that described it as hilarious. I expected a somewhat tragic story, but one written with wit and humor. Instead I found the book to be sickening and disturbing, but not even vaguely funny or amusing. I have never been able to watch the Jerry Springer Show for more than a few minutes before I change channels. If the Springer Show was put into book form, this is it. I had a hard time finishing the book. The author attempts to make child molestation and abuse entertaining. It just doesn't work for me."
1,The Jerry Springer of literature,"This book is to literature what Jerry Springer is to meaningful social commentary. It's poorly written, pointless, vapid, and gratuitous. Defiantly the worst book I have read in a long time. I was sucked in by the hype. Sure, some will say that I just don't ""get it,"" but there are a lot of people out there too dense to see that just because something is bizarre doesn't mean that its profound. This is drivel.The events described are too bizarre to be believable and, even if they are true, they're not interesting. I suspect that this is a ""memoir"" in the same sense as ""A Million Little Pieces,"" i.e., a fraud. I recently read an interesting article about how the family in this book is suing the author for defamation. Burroughs is clearly milking the dysfunctional bandwagon for all it's worth.If this is what passes for ""genius"" these days (as one reviewer described Burroughs), then our civilization needs to be destroyed..."
3,Debbie downer,"Pretty depressing, which I expected, but I felt like this kid never caught a break. Would have liked a little more closure."
2,THIS BOOK WAS OKAY,The writing was very good but the story was a bit disturbing and strange. I know that these things happen but I was touched by some of it. Some parts were sad and I felt sorry for the kid but some of the language was offensive and some of the things that the family did were weird.
2,Too Vulgar,"I appreciate honesty in a memoir, but the vulgarity in this book was too much for me and it made me put the book down. Seemed that this is where the book branched off from really good to really yuck."
2,Hard to Believe...,"I picked up this book as the next selection my book club had decided upon. I had never heard of it before and did not know what I was getting myself into. I can safely say that it kind of let me down. It was a quick read, but the events and situations the author found himself in were sometimes just too over-the-top to believe. The family he comes to live with just seemed too off the wall to imagine that they actually existed. To me, deciding to cut a hole in the roof for a skylight on a whim is not something my father would have condoned, like the father in the book did.Overall, the book kind of let me down. I don't think it turned out to be my kind of book."
3,Has the rubber-necking appeal of a car accident,"My reaction to this book was very similar to my reaction to seeing a horrible car accident...I know that, morally, I should turn away and pray for the lives of the families, but I can't tear my eyes away from the scene. As a result, this book was a very quick read, which is impressive given that I haven't finished many books lately. I didn't find this one as outrageously humorous as some of the reviewers, but I can see where they find at least some of the humor. Even the most horrifying moments are related with a dryness that almost results in humor. Almost.I can't say I'll be reading this again, and I won't be recommending it to anyone. I will see the movie out of sheer curiosity (when it goes to DVD). I think this is a story similar to ""The Squid and the Whale""--with the right directing, an amazing cast, and gifted editing, it could be quite good. As a book, though, it wasn't for me."
1,wish i had read these reviews before i bought the book,"I was just browsing the books looking for a good one..by the reviews on the book i was expecting a memoir of a quirkey, dysfunctionallook back and laugh at it childhood..I wish I had read these reviews first...I only completed the book because i paid for it and was determined to find the funny or interesting part.It was just sad..nothing funny or quirkey..the adults in this book are pathetic. The sexual abuse pages were hard to read and i mostly skipped a lot of it...Way too much detail for scenes involving a child..I dont think i will be watching the movie, the characters are just too annoying..The book is more disturbing than humorous and i will never trust ""professional"" reviews again...I am happy for the author for his success and hope he is healthy in spite of his childhood"
1,Disturbing,"I have never before written a book review, but felt the need to express my contempt for this horror story. Augusten's story is one which should have been dealt with in the comfort of a therapist's office, not a book. If indeed Running with Scissors is a memoir, how has Augusten managed to live a functional life (assuming that he has)? I have never read such a dark, graphically sexual book in my life. I did not find a bit of his story touching, affectionate or humorous, just sad and pathetic and not worth the read."
2,X-rated gay train wreck,"First off, don't misconstrue this as a homophobic rant. I was not prepared for the rather explicit gay sexual content in this book (especially when it starts off a chapter in graphic detail). That aside, the rest of the book is somewhat amusing but while reading I kept thinking ""can this really be true?"" and hoping it wasn't. Given a choice, I'd pass on this one. Not enough to make it worthwhile."
2,Extremely unsettling,"I felt truly sick after finishing this book. How could someone be even partially sane after living as Augusten did during his childhood and adolescence? Do people as emotionally bereft and unbalanced as the characters in this book really exist? Surely somone other than the waitress at the diner had the good sense and compassion to intercede in the insanity? Wouldn't the neighbors in the psychiatrist's neighborhood have registered numerous complaints with the authorities? My heart is unbelievably heavy at the thought that anyone, especially a child, has lived or lives like this."
3,Too skinny.,"Well, there are certainly some interesting situations in this book, and it's a wonder that the author managed to walk away with any sanity whatsoever. However, many of the situations in the book that would have been very interesting to explore don't go anywhere. The relationships between the author and the Finches are chopped short repeatedly, and don't really give a clear picture of those relationships developing over time. For example, he seems to be developing a close relationship with the older Finch girl, and then he seems to be spending all of his time with another one, and I was wondering what happened to his relationship with the first one. It gave me the impression that the book is a collection of random experiences, rather than a cohesive story.I think it's important to note that there is a very graphic description of his first gay sexual experience which surprised me with its detail. (The one place where I didn't really want a lot of detail.)"
2,Curiously unaffecting,"The world of literature is rife with outrageous and funny coming-of-age stories (Winterson's ""Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit"" comes immediately to mind, as do David Sedaris' biographic essays), and though this qualifies on both counts, it's curiously unaffecting. Neither as funny as it could be, nor as moving, the book is authored by a merely so-so, not great, writer who seems to keep his emotions--and us--at arm's length. Could have been both wrenchingly poignant and hysterically funny, and it's neither. Too bad."
1,Not funny!,"If this is truly not another Frey problem with veracity I cannot believe that anyone would find this book even slightly funny, not to mention outright hilarious. I am not offended by the mental illness presented, or by the gay relationships, or even the doctor who apparently had multiple ""wives."" What I was offended by was the idea that the situations presented in the book were a source of entertainment. This was much more tragic than comic. I am shocked by the fact that these situations went on for so long and that the general response is to laugh in reaction instead of cry. If it was one of your own children growing up where roaches infested the home, people defecated on the floor, and no one seemed to eat anything with much nutritional value wouldn't you cry and turn to authorities? Why are we looking at this as something funny?"
1,Awful,"This book is kind of sick. If you like to laugh at child molestation and pedophelia, I guess it's for you. I didn't get how it was funny, I don't tend to laugh at adults treating children so badly. What a downer! Sorry, I didn't find it funny at all."
2,Daytime TV Thrill,"Suddenly I am awash in humorous gay fiction. Do I hiss when I say the word ""gossip?"" I simply wonder: why should there be such a monumental lack of substance in this account? I am not particularly interested in hairdressing or oral sex or the dreams of a boy who wants to make a lot of money in New York City. But don't completely discount this freaky little memoir. The composition is passable, the narrator is likeable, psychiatry is dismantled, tacky consumerism gets a checkered flag, and lurid secret-telling is never dull, although ultimately Running With Scissors can't surpass cheap daytime TV, and it will leave you with the same sort of banal sickness in your stomach."
4,The most bizaar thing I have read in a while,"I swear, I don't think I can be shocked any more. The raves over this book had me watching my mailbox daily, dying for it to hurry up and arrive. I think I was a little disappointed in the book because the movie preview on tv, though odd, had a child-like quality to it and I expected to be rolling in the seats. Don't get me wrong, I laughed for much of the book but wasn't expecting such horrid details of this poor kid's life. I thought my family was weird ;-)If he comes out in 3 yrs. saying it was all a crock, I won't be surprised at all. Having said that, sometimes our own stories ARE stranger than fiction.Poor kid...........I will buy his other books, I think he's a great writer and I MUST follow his life, I am hooked now. I feel perfectly normal!"
1,Waste of Time,"I have only read rave reviews about this book. I fancy myself to be an open minded person, and have read my share of bad childhood books. Its not the content of this book that was bad, because a child is never responsible for the decisions that are forced upon him, but I found the authors callous treatment of serious issues to be a drain. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
2,Disturbing and Sad,"I read this for a book club years ago and barely got through it. Yes, it was witty and clever; but ""highly entertaining"" -- no. It was disturbing and sad."
2,Blah,"Full disclosure, i put it down 1/3 of the way through. It's not a bad book per se, it's like a much less funny David Sedaris novel - and frankly one of those is great, any more is over doing it. Weird, wacky childhood novels are a bit of a dime a dozen.If you haven't read David Sedaris, do that first. If you feel the need to continue then maybe this is the book for you."
1,Not entertaining or funny,"This book, although advertised as funny and entertaining, was not. The sex depicted was appalling and gratuitous and the story elicited more pity than amusement. I regret reading this book."
1,Disappointing and Disturbing,"I was utterly disappointed after reading this book There was so much hype about it that I had expected something more profound. Instead, it's basically a book about sexual child abuse in very graphic terms.In my opinion, there were no redeeming features at all: it was not funny and the writing was mediocre, as is usually the case with so-called memoirs.I found it disturbing that there seems to be a public hunger for books that are real-life experiences consisting of sadistic and cruel events. This kind of writing belongs in text/study books.The art of the novelist is certainly changing, perhaps even dying."
2,The horror overcame any humor,"Our book club decided to read this and relied on the back jacket reviews of a humourous coming of age story- even the movie was portrayed as an outrageous comedy. I (and the group) agreed that we got stuck on the difficult growing up situation, the utter lack of any responsible adults in the story , the graphic nature of the descriptive writing (which is excellent) and the pedophilia - not the homosexuality. I reveled at Augusten's ability to overcome the tragic situation but didn't even chuckle once. This was a hard read becasue it was true- this actually happened. We didn't see the humor in it. I cannot recommend this to the average reader and defintely not to the faint of heart. Burroughs is a very rare individual who overcame the worst of circumstance, was essentially self taught, and went on to turn the dross into gold."
2,True Story? I don't think so..embellished and sick in parts,"When I started the book I was thinking it was funny and twisted in an unusual and humorous way. But then comes the child pornography. It's not where someone just talks about being molested and moves on. The author graphically describes how the boy enjoys anal sex and getting blown by a backyard pedophile...from the lubrication, to the sounds to the enjoyment...pages of it...almost glorifying it. It read like porn between two consenting adults and made me sick to read it. Because you were reading porn like material and realizing it's a boy being molested (even though he enjoyed it, he's still a boy) and it's sick with the graphic nature of it.Also, you can tell the things being said and done were not something a kid that age would come up with thinking. So when you are reading it, you are thinking yeah right, this is a ""true"" story. Thats when I put the book down and decided to stop wasting my time on it."
1,Terrible!,Do not read this book! I don't see how anyone could like this. It was highly distrubing. I can't imagine a young teenager being exposed to such a dark and difficult life and my heart truly goes out to him. I read it on a friends recommendation and I am scarred for life. So if I can somehow save just one person from having the horrible images that this book has left in my brain forever than I have done someone a service.
2,I REALLY wanted this book to be good.,"Okay so you have read enough of the reviews to get the idea of this book...if not DO so...they are right here, easy to find. Rather than rehash that...a waste of electrons....let me just suggest that I really wanted this book to be good. It sounded like a wildly entertaining danse mababre. It was funny at times, sometimes outrageous. But it the end it was a hollow experience.I found it to have a pervasive sense of hollowness. It was as though the author was willing to shed light on his experiences but could not explore the shadows that light creates. I understand that it was a work of humor but what happens when the humor is just not that funny and you are left with the pathos?Laugh out loud funny.....nah....but I did smile a few times."
1,Not at all funny to me.,"I thought this was going to be a funny/sad/ecentric story. To me, there was not much funny about it. It was disturbing to me that he was raised in this situation and everyone seemed to just accept the doctor and the household."
2,OVERRATED,"If this is a memoir, it has to be embellished. Not all memories are real or accurate. I just don't buy it.This book palled in comparison to other memoirs, such as the Glass Castle and David Sedaris books. The writing was OK. If not for the pure insanity of the content, I'm not sure the book would have made it on its own merit.It got tons of rave reviews, but I don't see what all the fuss is about. Everybody said the book was funny. It's not. Not even in a dark twisted way. Not even in a clever way. Wacky and unbelievable characters and situations don't make a book funny.Finally, I'm probably one of the least homophobic people in the world, but caveat emptor if you have a problem with graphic and overly-descriptive man on man love. I just don't like reading too many details about sex period. It is a lazy and unimaginative writer who needs to describe sexual details so graphically where they add nothing to the story.This book was highly disappointing."
1,Would that there was a lower rating than 1,"This is an utter cow pie of a book. It is dreary badly written, badly edited (if it was edited at all). A tedious whinging that goes nowhere and tells the reader nothing. I didn't throw it out because it would taint my garbage, so its now back at the publishers. 200 some odd people trying to offload used and new copies of this book? Not really surprising, they don't want in their garbage either."
3,"Mildly entertaining, but hard to believe","Unfortunately, I read this book after reading an article in Vanity Fair about how the real-life ""Finch"" family is suing Burroughs -- they dispute most things he wrote and claim that he either made up or exaggerated the events. So while the book was entertaining in describing the bizarre lifestyle of the Finches (as well as Burroughs' mother), I found myself questioning everything. It seems too crazy to be true, and in fact, may be not be true. I think actually hope that Burroughs did exaggerate; while the book was an easy read, I found it disturbing -- the total absence of parental control, the ethical misconduct of the doctor, etc."
2,Disappointing,"I purchased this book while spending some time in the airport during a lay-over. The copious, enthusiastic reviews convinced me that this would be an enjoyable read.While the story was interesting, albeit disturbing, I failed to find any ""laugh-out loud"" passages or anything which merited more than a smirk. The entire book simply failed to live up to the hype - now I see its being made into a ""major motion picture"" with Gwyneth Paltrow - what role could she possibly play?"
3,Almost too strange to be true,"I will start by saying that I enjoyed this book and read it in about 2 days. This book keeps you engaged because it is well written, but most of all the childhood of the author is beyond strange that you feel compelled to keep reading because it gets progressively stranger as the pages go by. Be prepared, you will be laughing at things that, well frankly, normally wouln't and feel a little guilty as a result. Nevertheless, read it, you will remember this book."
3,Engaging for a little while,"This can-you-believe-my-messed-up-childhood memoir was funny, sad, and engaging for about 40 pages. After that, the novelty wore off as the author didn't go any deeper. The memoir wasn't tied together--more a chronological list of vignettes illustrating his dysfunctional family and sexual situations. I did finish it--I only finished the last few chapters because I had already poured several hours of my vacation into reading most of the book already. I gave this to my sister-in-law after I finished. She read about 30 pages and gave it back to me. This author is taleneted, clearly, but the material was little more than a well-written but superficial account of events."
1,Running with Scissors,"In a word, disturbing. I just couldn't find the humor in this one, nor could I get more than half way through the book. I was just too sad. As a teacher I just felt for the author and as a parent I did not understand how a mother or father could be so misguided in raising their child. The author knows his craft, but I just did not enjoy the book as well as I hoped to."
4,Dark but readable,"As a read, it is dark and almost too disgusting to handle. Thinking of it as a memoir, it is disturbing that things like this actually take place. I am a reader that has little time to read for pleasure and this was not a waste of time. I enjoyed it and read it quickly. My book club has all agreed that it is one of those that you don't want to admit that you enjoyed reading it. I am glad I read it and am looking forward to the movie to see how it plays out."
5,Hysterical,"One of the best books I've read! Unbelievably disturbing, but with a constant humorous tone."
1,disgusting,"Amazon usually provides me with great reads and reviews; either I read the reviews wrong or other readers are amazingly simple; this book jumps from one psychopathic locale to another more disgustingly and sick one. I know this is supposed to be a true story but I have a hard time believing any of it to tell you the truth. The sick descriptions of sexual routines between characters are enough to make one vomit; I only read about forty percent of this book, then deleted it from my Kindle. If this guy is an author, look out, classic authors! There is no plot, no clear setting, no clear theme, no clear anything in this twisted book. Actually, I am not sure that even one star should be on this book; should be zero. Basically, I love Amazon and buy all of my ebooks there because of the great service I receive, but, if you are considering buying this book, know that it is not a PG rating-more like R."
2,It isn't funny. It isn't interesting. I don't buy it.,"I kind of felt like all he did was combine the most disturbing things he could think of into as few pages as possible for the shock factor rather than tell a story, and the effect was, of course, that nothing was all that appalling. It also was kind of sucky that he spent so little time actually getting into his own head--something I quite enjoy about memoirs--everything just seemed to be about adding this shock factor and this shock factor until nothing really mattered at all. It wasn't funny either. There wasn't a single moment I cracked even a smile at anything that was ""supposedly"" funny. Augusten Burroughs seems like he'd be a really boring person to hang out with.That being said, the book was readable and I got through it in merely two days. It wasn't terrible. It was pretty weird. But for me, it wasn't all that interesting. Thankfully I didn't buy it and just got it from the library."
2,Didn't do it for me.,"They say ""Don't judge a book by its cover."" I've also learned not to judge a book by its title. It's probably my fault that I didn't do a bit more research into what this book was about before I purchased it, but the title caught my eye and I tend to be an impulsive buyer when it comes to books. Unfortunately, I also feel compelled to finish what I start and so struggled through this book to its completion. I'm normally a thriller, mystery, horror kind of guy, but enjoy a good comedy when I can find one. I would not classify this book as a comedy. Some others have obviously enjoyed this story, but I found it disturbing and nothing more."
2,um....isn't this abuse??,"As I sat reading this book, I was seriously sickened by what Augusten went through (if in fact true) and the lack of a response from the system regarding what can only be described as utter abuse and neglect. Whomever that psychiatrist is, well, he clearly shouldn't be in the field given his own mental instability and poor judgement.As a therapist (social worker) whose clinical work has focused on and specialized in treating trauma and sexual abuse, I just can't see this book as funny. It's nearly nauseating, thinking about what the family went through. That Augusten came out alive is a testament to his strength, but to see this book in a comedic light is just impossible for me to do."
5,Running With Scissors-literally,"The book was recommended to me on my yahoo. I read it in two hourse flat. Unable to put it down. Being a non american, it never fails to amaze me how messed up people's lives can be here. This family however took the cake. The most dysfunctional family I have yet to see. I kept flipping to the front cover to check if I missed out any disclaimers. Kudos to author Burroughs for coming out as such a superb writer inspite of so many problems. Parents,doctor,friend. Everybody had a small and significant role to play in Augusten's life. And the series of events following the divorce kept you turning the pages at an unimaginable rate to see what surprise is in store.A must read for everyone-fiction lovers as well as thos who look down on fiction. If you are the kind who thinks your life is a mess- read this and get inspired to make something of your life!"
1,Painfully obvious...,"...that Burroughs only has an elementary school education. Superficially written, no challenging ideas, emotions, or vocabulary. His childhood wasn't eccentric, it was criminal. A collection of shockingly sad short stories portrayed as grotesque humor."
4,An enjoyable summer read,Enjoyed this book whilst on holidays. Quite disturbing and though provocating at times. I would definitely recommend this book to my friends.
4,Ok book,"This was an OK book..... I picked it because I loved ""look Me In The Eye"" written by this author's brother..... Although Augesten is the actual writer in the family..... I found his brother to be the better writer..... I liked this book.... But it didn't really measure up to my expectations...."
5,Takes a tragic situation & makes it hilarious!,"This author is amazing! He has the ability to take his childhood & write about abusive, neglectful, and just plain odd situations with wit and emotional distance. I would say he's even better than David Sedaris. We read this for our book group & there was NO ONE (in our group) who didn't like it."
2,Definitely NOT David Sedaris,"I picked up this book shortly after reading Dress Your Family In Corduroy & Denim (David Sedaris), partly because critics have described the humor/style akin to that of Sedaris (and I suppose the critical acclaim itself played some part in my decision). I should have followed my initial instincts and passed it by. The characters in this book are much too contrived to be real, the detail of events too keen. Had the author penned it as fiction, I might have enjoyed it more as I am a devoted fan of John Irving and human dysfunction in general. Yes, it is disturbing but not in any meaningful way - as others posting have noted - which makes it wholly gratuitous. I don't doubt that Augusten's young years were troubled but I don't buy this as a memoir and even if it were, I'm not interested."
1,I can't believe I finished it...,"A (very) exaggerated memoir in which I have a hard time believing anything in the plot had to do with someone's reality at any point. As with other reviews, I agree the sex scenes were a bit much. Although I am usually a pretty forgiving and understanding reader, thinking ""Well it must be significant to the plot"". Not so much. We get it, you're homosexual Augusten. That's fine, good for you. I would have been just as offended had it been a heterosexual person writing about their sexual conquests in such a manner. I honestly had a hard time finishing it, I was so disgusted. The rest of the book made sense and fit, but the sex descriptions had no bearing on the plot and were just in there to make it ""edgy"", I guess. Don't bother."
1,yuck,"This book was awful, I appreciate a book about ""nutty"" families, but this was over the top. My family looks like the Cleavers compared to these freaks. This book is downright depressing, and ridiculous, they are so insane, it's unbelievable I love to read all different kinds of books, but I can't think of one good thing to say about this book."
1,Annoying,I wish my friends who read this book had told me not to waste my time; I guess I should have interpreted their lackluster endorsements as attestations to the book's mediocrity.There are no sympathetic characters. The book is too fantastical to be a memoir. The depiction of mental illness is shallow and contrived. The writing style is amateurish. I'd give zero stars if an option.i.e. Don't waste your time.
1,"If I could give it a ""no"" star, I would.","I don't think I have ever quit reading a book midway. I could find NOTHING humerous about this book, and the characters have no character."
1,Keep Running,"I found this story to be far from funny - dark humor - not. It was a sad and pathetic story. And as such, I had no pity for the characters. I thought it was well written and I could picture the characters and the scenes, but didn't really care. The only redeeming piece of the book was the very end, when after all the two young characters actually made, or tried to make, someting of their lives. Pick up the book at your local bookstore, read the last page, put it back on the shelf and run..."
5,One of the best books I've ever read....,"...couldn't put it down. SO funny and bizarre that I had to keep reminding myself that it was all true. And when I was through I plowed thru all the others. When ""Possible Side Effects"" came out in the summer I couldn't bring myself to read it just yet, because I know when I'm done I'll have no more Augusten Burroughs left to read. DEFINITELY read these books in order. I have several friends who have read all of them as I finished. TOO FUNNY."
2,I have mixed feelings about this book.,"I have mixed feelings about this book. I was deeply saddened and shocked by this story. The detailed homosexual encounters made me really uncomfortable. I have to admit, the story is a good one, but extremely disturbing if all of this really happened to the author."
5,just when u thought YOUR family was crazy...,burroughs nailed his memoir. this book is morbidly hilarious from front to back. i enjoyed it so much i read it in one day. this is the type of book you don't put down and look forward to sharing with your friends.don't miss this book.
4,Laugh out loud...sort of.,"Do you actually laugh at something like this? I wasn't sure how to take it in. Sometimes I wanted to laugh but felt guilty for doing so. This (i think) was a wonderful story. I kept thinking how odd that I enjoyed it so much when so much seemed so awful. I think the way it was written kept me from feeling guilty about enjoying this. The characters all seemed to know they were a bit crazy. Everyone had some sort of ""issue"". From Dr. Finch, to Agnes to Augusten. Some seemed to have more issues than others that's for sure. I find it hard to believe it took me so long to read this. Since I took my time I am now able to enjoy ""Dry"" right away. I find it hard to recommend this book but at the same time find it just as hard not to. Bizarre, funny, witty, horrible, weird...all wrapped into one."
1,not funny. too much information.,"I can't imagine how the any review of this book could come up with funny. What does ""disturbingly funny"" mean. I must not get that kind of humor. It's disturbing, and not funny.I feel sick and I'm going to have to shower before going to bed tonight."
1,Pedophilia is not funny,"There is nothing funny about this book at all. I've carefully considered other's comments that the author found humor & showed courage in his ability to cope with an abysmal, horrific childhood.I strongly disagree. This book merely sensationalizes cruelty to humans and animals, pedophilia and deranged scatalogical acts. The author is skillful & funny, but why write a book about such horrors? To purge himself? As a psychiatric tool to heal the scars of abandonment & rape? These are some of the sickest, most twisted characters in literature, although the author claims they are real people. I wonder how much poetic license was taken.A very polarizing book as evidenced by ratings.Should be banned from public/school libraries where children could get their hands on it.I'm with the group that gives it a solid zero stars, and wish I'd never read it. I was on an airplane, otherwise would have thrown it out the window into outer space."
2,Mediocre at best,"I finally read this book after receiving several recommendations from friends. All I can say is that I now question their taste in books, and I'm somewhat ashamed that I believed the hype. Like another commenter, I kept waiting for the good part but found that it never came. Sure, Burroughs had a messed up and extremely odd childhood. However, the sequence of shock and awe, boring filler, shock and awe, boring filler, etc. is not enough to hold this book together. Apparently, a bad childhood does not a great writer make. Don't waste your time on this immature, repetitive, and underdeveloped work. The writing is so poor that you'll think Burroughs wrote it during his teenage high school dropout years."
1,"about the worst book I have read during 2008, NO, I did not even finish it.","I tried to read it, I gave it a good shot but.... it's total trash.nothing funny about it, plain trash.I wish I could get my money back.I just threw the book in the ...... TRASH !don't buy it, don't read it.Hans Muellers"
2,I don't think so,"Yeah? Really? It happened just like that? If you're looking for a thoughtful, how-I-triumphed-despite-my-messy-childhood memoir, pass on this one."
3,I don't get it...,"Allow me to begin this review by saying that I'm glad I read this book if for no other reason than the pop culture excuse. (I recently heard it has been optioned for a movie.)That's the good part. The bad part is that nothing about this story was particularly moving or funny. Many times I found myself thinking ""why wouldn't I just read a Sedaris book instead?"". Also, I must say that this was so strange in parts as to almost seem unbelievable or contrived, and even if it wasn't, there wasn't enough supporting storylines for many of the chapters to make the reader relate to Augusten.One last word of warning to potential readers: parts of this book are VERY graphic as the author describes sexual experiences he has had. I thought they were completely and utterly out of place and unnecessary, as they did nothing to bolster the story. Nevertheless, they're there."
5,What about the writing?,"I really, really liked this book. Burroughs style is sharp, smart and funny. The fact that a lot of the negative reviews on this book are that it is ""disturbing"" disturbs me. Books, like movies, are not meant to be fluffy stuff all of the time. The fact that Augusten's childhood was disturbing is part of what made this such a great book. I imagine that a lot of his inspiration and his intelligence came from the childhood he had which was definitely out of the ordinary. I don't see that as a reason to not like the book, but a reason to love it."
1,Yawn,Ho hum and so whatI really really can't remember when I was so bored.Like a rip off of Sedaris...without the humor.Why don't they let you give no stars?
4,great book,I enjoyed this book very much. It was entertaining & funny. It was easy to read and finished it in no time. I gave it to my father to read and my mom said that my dad won't put the book down. He likes it so far.
2,Two stars.,"Perhaps I would have really liked this book had it been billed as a work of fiction. As a memoir, though, I found it a little hard to believe. It is as if the writer is trying to make his childhood out to be as apalling as possible just to sell a book. I don't doubt that Mr.Burroughs had a dysfunctional background. Who among us didn't to some degree? But to put even those characters who had nothing but good, although perhaps misguided, intentions in such a unflattering light just to sensationalize his story left a bad taste in my mouth."
1,"either a hit or miss, depending on the reader","I was sure this would be a hit for me. I love disturbing comedy, memoirs, and at the point where nothing is shocking. I wanted to like this book, but it not funny, not believable, and sometimes just gross.There's nothing wrong with being gay, but the graphic descriptions of the affair between a 13 year old boy and his 36 year old boyfriend provided by Burroughs belong in a Nambla Forum.I stopped reading this 1/3rd of the way through. Had it been funny or believable I would have skipped the smut. Big dissapointment."
1,Awful and disturbing,"I thought this book would be funny. I bought it in a collectibles store for $3. Now I know why it was there. It's rude, crude and disturbing. I made it halfway through the book and threw it in the trash. Don't waste your money. There are much better books out there that don't make you feel like you should take a shower after putting the book down. Ugh!"
1,"Not funny, sorry piece of ""literature""","Please do not waste your time on this book. It is not funny at all, author uses techniques of ""shock value"" in this book which instead of being funny turns out to be totally disgusting and felt really sorry for each of crewed up character in the book. I could not finish the book; I felt dirty and wanted to take shower after reading half of it. I am not overly sensitive person, but this book over the top. Because there is not a drop of intelligence, author uses ""shock value"" to draw the attention to the book. There is no substance at all. This book is about degradation of characters and not sure how anyone can find it funny."
1,Ugh,"I was so excited to read this ""hilarious"" book. How disappointing. It was disgusting. I ended up ripping it up to keep any of my kids from finding it and making the same mistake as I made, which was reading it until I decided it wasn't going to get any better, but by then having disgusting images in my mind. (It's one thing to say ""I came home from school and caught my mother engaged in lesbian activities."" Quite another to describe and dwell on them. Seems to me he was trying to sensationalize, not just vent, about his childhood. How sad this was popular enough to be made into a movie."
2,Not so much....,"I too love memoires of dysfunctional gay men, but this story didn't do it for me. I just KNEW that I would love it, but I think I have chuckled once, maybe twice. The very graphic relationship between the 13 year old and 36 year old was a bit much to stomach....and I can handle crazy and dysfunctional. I would go with Mr. Sedaris for a good dysfunctional laugh!"
2,I couldn't get into this book.,I'd heard so many good things about this book that I ran out and bought a copy. I guess I can see the appeal but it did nothing for me. It took me weeks to actually finish it because it didn't hold my interest.
4,Disturbingly Entertaining.,"I can't help but compare this book to a train wreck - you don't want to stare, but you can't look away. I couldn't put this book down, but there were times when I was slightly embarrassed by what I was reading! And that takes a lot - I'm a very open-minded person.With that out of the way, this was a great book! I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a humorous read. I do NOT recommend this one to anyone prudish or closed-minded to any type of alternative lifestyle."
1,disturbing,"Although funny at times, this book was disturbing and vulgar. I disliked it so much, that I threw it in the garbage when I was done reading it."
2,running with scissors,The book running with scissors was about agusten burroughs crazy child hood. Augusten goes from living with both of his parents to living in the house of his mothers pyscatrist and theres lots of crazy stuff in bettween. i disagreed with the critics rateing of this book. The book was on the new yorks best sellers list for 70 weeks and i thought it was lucky the book got published. I didnt think the book really had hte edge to make you not want to put it down. I also didnt care for the writing style of the author. Unfourtunitaly the cover of the book with a boy with a box on his head is about as intresting as the book gets.
1,Running with scissors,"I did not enjoy the book, perhaps that is an understatement!We were traveling and I actually threw the book away. I hope the author of the book has a Day Job!The physical condition of the book was fine."
1,Running With Scissors,"As a teacher of young children, some of whom have suffered from severe neglect and abuse, I found this book offensive. Trivializing traumatic events in the lives of the most vulnerable among us disturbs me. It is only an optimistic nature that propelled me through this book, hoping for some relief from the constant betrayal this boy endured. The dispassionate description of the atrocities and neglect in this boy's life is frightening. If this guy really lived this life, I am astounded neighbors did not report the whole menagerie to CPS, the police, the medical licensing board, the truancy officer, and anyone I've not mentioned who represents the well being of children and mentally ill adults in this society. This is no laugh riot; this is the story of a child who disassociated himself from the pain of abandonment and abuse. I hope writing this was therapeutic for him, but it didn't do me any good."
1,Offensive and pathetic!,"This book was recommended to me by a friend whose principals and taste I generally admire. I'm disappointed in her taste in reading material. The author's life as a young boy was in no way amusing or funny. In fact, it was outright offensive. I followed it to the end hoping for some redeeming moment, but never found it. Don't waste your time with this one."
1,Ughhhhhh,"I hate this book. I find this book really hard to believe. I think a lot of it was made up. You may ask yourself, ""Why is this book so bad?"" This book is so bad that I don't feel the need to explain how bad it is. So there..."
1,Sedaris should be offended,"I only got a few chapters into this book, but soon I realized that it wasn't going to get any better so I went downstairs into the garage, took the lid off the garbage can, and buried it deep inside. Although I could have resold it, I guess, I thought it would be much better to eliminate at least one copy from worldwide circulation. I'm glad to hear that I was not alone in this -- other members of my bookclub did exactly the same.I was greatly offended at the author's attempts to humorize painful, disgusting, and evil behavior. I do not believe that if you have had a crappy childhood you are never entitled to laugh, but it is very wrong, I think, to make light of or make jokes about morally deviant and evil behavior."
1,Disgusting,This was a disgusting book. I am too embarrassed to say I bought this garbage let alone tried to read it. Threw it in the trash.
5,Great for Teen Girl,My teenage daughter loved this as a gift. Age appropriate for probably 15 and above.
3,"spell check, Augusten, spell check!",Am I the only one who has noticed that Augusten spells Donny Osmond wrong (it's not Donnie) and Golda Mier wrong (it's not Meier) throughout the book? I hope the editors clean that up in future editions. Other than that...a fun read.
2,submission at the yellow submarine,"The truth, as they say, IS stranger than fiction. In the house of denial, crazziness abounds and breeds unspeakable acts."
1,Disgusting!,This book was absolutely disgusting and I don't believe even half of it actually happened.
1,Vulgar and crude!!!,"I was surprised at the gross, vulgar passages I found by simply turning to several random pages. I didn't even dare read it because of the crude parts I came across. Definitely not for someone with a clean mind."
3,Many emotions...,"Your mother is poet going crazy. Your father is alcoholic. And you're a young boy who knows he's gay growing up in the `70s. Augusten Burroughs' memoir is funny, crazy, and at times, heartbreaking. His mom drops off Augusten at her therapist's house for ""just a bit"", but he ends up spending most of his teen years growing up there. Patients live in the dirty house along with the therapist and his own very strange family, which happens to include an adopted pedophile. I heard they are making this into a movie, and I would recommend reading this book beforehand. I can't wait to see what Augusten does as he grows up, which he chronicles in his next book, Dry."
3,Left me with a lot of wondering. . .,"Although Burroughs' writing is fresh and easily allows the reader to experience the hilarity, sadness, and sheer insanity of what goes on in his life, the book left me wondering at times and wanting more. There were moments of the book I felt there were things better kept to himself. . .some things added only for shock value. Also, the book just abruptly ends. Neing that it is a memoir by a New York Times bestseller author, my wife and I both assumed at some point it would come to where he was no longer living such a crappy, mundane, crazy life. . .... I enjoyed the book to a point, but would probably not read anything further by Burroughs."
2,"Page turner, but no substance","The book is a memoir rather than an autobiography so it is more episodic (no pun intended) than linear and while each character is certainly colorful, there is no sense of exactly who each person is beyond a set of very weird behaviors. The author mentions a series of quirks (some funny, some very disturbing) with no foundation. Why does the family save its turkey bones and break its dishes? How long did they live outside? How many pills did he take?In the end, the people are interesting anecdotes, but I just don't care enough about them to read the sequel.For those who are looking for a memoir that seizes humor out of tragedy, I would recommend ""Angela's Ashes"" rather than ""Running with Scissors""."
2,"Well written, but too disturbing!!","Well written, very visual and interesting characters. If reading about a boys first homosexual experiences in detail and scooping human feces out of the toliet and setting it out in the sun to dry sound like something you'd like to read about...this is the book for you!! It wasn't for me...So, bizarre I wonder how much is even true. They say truth is stranger than fiction...but, not something I enjoyed reading...The disgusting segments out weighed the credible writing..."
4,Strange but fun!,"This was one wacky book, but I really enjoyed it. I have to admit, since this was a memoir, I kept thinking this poor kid! Still I kept reading because I never knew what was going to happen next to this guy.The book reminds me a lot of the memoir by David Sedaris (did I get the author right?) Not because they are both gay, but because of the way they let us see into their quirky world.I do recommend this book and I look forward to his next book."
4,Disturbing because it is true,"I found the book to be an interesting read and was fasinated by the story. However, after first I didn't realize it was an autobiography. The book is engaging and will keep you turning the pages. Honestly, Augustine endured a lot during his childhood."
5,Augusten Fan!,"i loved this book. its dark humor at its best. if you like this also check out Dry, the sequel."
2,Not funny but I read it anyway,"Any comparison to David Sedaris does Sedaris a HUGE disservice. Sedaris is hilarious. This is not a funny book, but I did feel compelled to keep reading it--I think for its bizarreness factor. About halfway through I realized that there was no way this was a true memoir. No one would live on a street with the Finch family and not call the authorities. I am not at all opposed to homosexuality, but as the mother of two sons I am thoroughly appalled at how anyone can think that the abusive molestation of a 13 year old boy by a sick, shallow, self-absorbed adult is funny."
2,"when you finish this book , you wish you hadn't read it.","Burroughs is a fine writer and i feel for the guy. but, gotta say it: the book's disturbing, and not in a good way. the autobiographical material he had to work with is so... sick. unless you are a reader who has grown up in a similarly drug-oriented, sex-focused environment where mental health is in short supply, w-a-a-y too much disclosure.most telling is the epilogue, in which Burroughs goes thru a where-are-they-now with all the main characters. some are dead, some are disabled, only one or two seem to be at all functional. this book makes you wish Burroughs all the best in his life because he's already experienced a sort of hell."
3,"Interesting, funny, and a bit too explicit","This book keeps its momentum from the first page to the last. The author is able to engage the reader throughout. Before buying this book, however, one should be aware of specific content that is not eluded to on the cover. There are several sexually explicit and possibly highly offensive passages in this book. The author goes into so much detail about his homosexual encounters that the book should be rated ""x"". This book is certainly not suitable for all readers."
5,You think your family is dysfunctional???!!!,"One of the most amazing reads ever. The books is humorous, witty, depressing, painful and hopeful all wrapped into one. You can't help but feel empathy (not pity) for the author and his unconventional, borderline totally messed up, upbringing. But the author has a way of resolving the story by giving you (and himself) the upmost hope. I really could not put this book down, wanting with the upmost anticipation to see what was around the corner."
1,Sorry I wasted my time,"I decided on reading this book based on the fact that I enjoy memoirs where the author has risen above the rubble to experience fulfillment or something positive. With that being said, this book is beyond terrible. Burroughs is extremely distasteful in his descriptions of a family that took him in from his off-her-rocker mother and humiliated everyone who came into contact with him. I also wonder if anything in the book is even true because he writes with a detachment that either alludes to him needing MORE therapy or none of these things having happened at all. Sorely disappointing."
4,Wow!,"I was so upset that this guy had this life. I wanted to save him. But it helped me see my own past in a different way! Beware, some of the content is raw! Not for kids!"
1,Don't Waste Your $,I made it about half way through this book and said forget it. I took it down to the local library and donated it. I don't know the last time I started a book and didn't finish it but this book just wasn't worth even that. In fact I felt I was somehow doing myself a favor by stopping. I hated every character -- there wasn't a single person that I cared about in the least tiniest amount. Reading this book was like having to eat your least vegetable out of the garbage can.
3,Who cares,"I would have to say the book was average. It was an easy read because it was broken up into short stories and some of the book was funny but the lack of character development and my inability to actually care about the author or anybody else in the book left me bored and uninterested. Additionally, I wouldn't doubt that the impending lawsuits against burroughs will show that the book should have been classified as fiction instead of as a memoir."
1,"Disturbing - yes, Entertaining - no","Sorry, can't jump on the bandwagon with this one. It's a catalog of neglect and abuse thats writing may have proven cathartic to Mr Burroughs, but reading could only be deemed amusing to the sadist in training."
1,Running With Scissors,"This could have been an interesting and humorous book if the author had left out the very graphic, and disgusting sex scenes.I don't think those sections of the book added anything positiveto the book, but certainly made it what I would call ""undesirable literature."" I often wonder how books likethat even get published. It was a waste of time to read it."
1,Filed it in my circular file,"This book was advertised as darkly humorous. I found it dark but not humorous. It was the only book I can remember throwing away because I just couldn't see any redeeming value in it. The author fills us in on whats happening but not really how this affects him emotionally. I must admit I kept wondering where the neighbors were through all the weird goings on at the ""old victorian house on a nice street"". Also, the scenes between Neil and the author were just a little to graphic. I'm not asking for sugar coating, I know these things happen, but just a little less detail would have been better. I was disappointed with this book and wish I had taken the time to read the reviews before I bought it. Don't waste your time or your money."
2,Disturbing . . . and not funny,"I felt the writing was forced--as though Mr. Burroughs was begging for a laugh. I don't understand how anyone could laugh at the most horrifying childhood anyone could imagine. Why does the ""A Million Little Pieces"" debacle creep into my mind? It's the lack of genuineness--the way the story is pieced together with the hopes of entertaining. It's shocking, disturbing and disgusting--and mostly, lacking veracity. There's something off kilter here and I can't quite put my finger on it . . ."
4,Unsure What to Make of this Book,"""Running with Scissors"" was interesting, shocking, and, in a few places funny. However, most of the times, the book is just downright disturbing. An account of the life of Augusten Burroughs, from roughly age twelve to sixteen. He leaves the semi-normal existence he had with his unhappily married parents, and goes to live with the family of his mother's shrink. He lives in dirty conditions, where rules are practically non-existent, and children of all ages basically do whatever they want. As a young teen, Burroughs also engages in a sexual relationship with a man in his 30s. Although I read the book rather quickly, it was not one of the best books I have read recently. The fact that the people depicted in this book exist in real life, astonished and scared me. I would recommend reading this, but be prepared for some graphic sexual subject matter/descriptions."
5,Dark humour,"Firstly, I am surprised that so many people have been so offended by this book. I found this book to be both hilarious and every time I put it down I couldn't wait to get back to it.I think it pays to remember that bad things do happen to good innocent people, even children. I commend Augusten Burroughs for writing with such an accent on humour rather than wallowing in 'poor me' mode.I want to believe that everything he wrote is true (not because it should have happened to anyone but just because he sells it on the basis that it did) but at times I am stretched to believe things haven't been embellished for shock value.This book truly inspires me to start writing.For the record I think there is a connection between the styles of Burroughs and Sedaris."
5,I'll bet this will be made into a movie !,"I found this book to be both heart wrenching and hilarious . This boy's life is so outrageous, nobody could possibly make up the things he experienced . I highly recommend it to anyone with an open mind. It even made me feel "" normal "" by comparison!"
2,Disappointing,I was looking forward to reading this story but I was very disappointed once I did. I was not particularly amused nor was I horrified. I just didn't care about any of the people in the story. I didn't feel any great emotion from the author about these events except at the beginning when his parents were fighting and they were dragging him to counselling.It was a fast read and mildly interesting but I recommend taking it out of the library.
4,Alarming - but couldn't put it down.,"I enjoyed the book, but was rather traumatized by it at the same time. The author has an interesting way of allowing the reader to laugh at things that are absolutely dreadful! Will continue to look for new works by this author."
2,This book is an act of self gratification,"I bought this on a whim because a few people had told me it was ""hysterical"" and it was a best-seller, so I figured it must be pretty good.How a tripe, narcissistic, uninspired story like this ever became a best seller is beyond me. I can only imagine that its reasoning lies in the books graphic and completely un-romantic portrayal of homosexuality or its ability to remove all emotional impact from things like rape, mental disease or the pain of a broken home.I finished reading it thinking that this author should probably seek psychiatric help in order to be able to connect substantially with any human being. Which is all well and good, but hardly worth the price of buying his dumb book."
2,Running With Scissors,"An alcholic father, a psychotic mother, a neglectful therapist/foster parent and a pedophile are only a few of the odd characters in Running with Scissors. Augusten Burroughs memoir is filled with deeply disturbing passages made light through his sense of humor. I'm not sure whether I enjoyed the book, or was just revolted by the adults in his life. Overall, this book is well written and an engaging look at family dysfunction."
2,Just not for me...,"I heard so much buzz aboutRunning with Scissorsthat I had to try it. I generally enjoy memoirs, was prepared for some difficult stories, and expected David Sedaris-like wry bitterness. What I got was a headache. I just couldn't find myself engaged. Still don't know entirely why - he is not a bad writer by any means, but I just never connected with him and the whole book left me feeling utterly disinterested."
2,A Miserable Book,"I was also sucked in by the comparrisons to David Sedaris. David Sedaris has subtlty and wit and relevence. This book, not so much. Even on its own merrits though, I couldn't recommend it. The writing is about comparable to a university memoir seminar writing course. Meaning that it's not poorly written, but it's not great either. More important though was that Burroughs doesn't really make the characters human enough to care what it is going on with them. I'm fine with dark comedy and writing about difficult times, but not when I couldn't care less about who is telling the story and who is in it. The final message about learning to survive and taking those survival skills doesn't come until the last line of the book. The rest of it just feel like treading water. The pay off wasn't worth it."
4,Truth is stranger than Fiction,"An interesting memoir about a man who grew up in a psychotic household, well actually two households. He moved back and forth between his crazy mother and her demented psychiatrist. He tells about his life beginning about age 11, often with raunchy details and disturbing events that make you wonder what's really happening behind the closed doors of your own neighbors. Nothing is as it appears. This book was fast-paced and kept my attention throughout as I continued to wonder how a boy growing up in this environment could later evolve into a man capable of writing such an entertaining piece of work. I was disappointed in the ending though, as it only left me still wondering. It seemed very abrupt. Maybe there will be a sequel?"
1,TERRIBLE BOOK,"What a waste of money. Not even worth passing on, goes in trash!!! I have never rated a book so poorly before.I read 2/3rds of this and should have thrown in trash sooner!!!"
4,GREAT READ!,"The first book I read was the most recent and I realized that I have to read all his books. So here I am writing my review on the second A.B. book that I have read. This great read makes you realize how a so normal looking person could have had the most tramatic life and be the biggest lunatic. (just kidding Augusten) This real life story is the most interesting life story I have ever read... next is ""Dry"" (which is the sequel to this one for all who do not know.)"
2,Disingenuous packaging,"Cover blurbs of ""high jinx"" and ""mordantly funny"" are too light for the amount of graphic pedophilia in this book. I realize the pedophile is mentioned on the back cover, but he does much more to the narrator than ""befriend"" him.It's also poorly edited - ""Queen Helene"" in a chapter heading and ""Queen Helen"" in the text."
2,"All Flash , No Heart","This book is packaged as a memoir of sorts ,but it reads more like a John Irving novel in early pre development . Flatly episodic , each page seems to be trying to be more outragous than the last , but unlike the typical Irving novel ,there is no build up ,little character devolpment ,and after a time the reader grows weary of incidents which try too hard to be shocking.What is mostly lacking though in this supposed memoir is any true picture of the individuals involved ,any sense of sympathy for them as people - instead we are left with one strange incident after another ,an example of which finds various characters attempting to divine the future from their feces ;indeed an entire chapter is given over to detailing this dubious eneterprise.Finally , Scissors is like a Henny Youngman vaudeville routine - occassional flashes of humor escape from onslaught, but in the end what we are left with is an empty and unsatisfying experience , all flash and no heart."
1,Humm....,"Do you know what its like when someone shares too much information about something really inappropriate? That is how I felt after reading this book.. I didn't think it was funny and frankly it was quite sad. I read this book because it was compared to David Sedaris books, believe me, they are not the same style at all. I would not recommend this book to anyone. Very disappointing and disturbing."
4,Outrageous and Graphic,"I read this book over a four day period and found it hiliarous and overly graphic. It is hard to imagine any child growing up in this type of atmosphere, so hard in fact that if I didn't know that it was nonfiction upon starting the book then I would have never believed it to be so. I highly recommend this book.I have started the second part of his book 'Dry' shortly after with high hopes that it would be as fun and outrageous."
2,Gross Fiction,The toilet bowl message concerning this book points down. I am glad that this book has been discredited as a memoir by people who knew the literary caricatures presented.
1,No good- despite the reviews...,"After reading rave reviews of this book- here on this website and in other publications, I recommended this for my book club to read. My mistake- now they all second guess my suggestions- not one of us liked this book. It has an intriguing and wild life story, but not one that I necessarily wanted to know, or can honestly believe. The writing, while having a few having a few great moments of description or insight, was elementary and made the reading even harder- a bit like reading a high school students fiction story or autobiography. This is one that shows that the reviewers are not always to be trusted."
1,as a writer burroughs talent is barely above a zero,"if you want to read some one's self obsessed drivel about why their childhood was so weird without actually being given any insight into why it was (am i the only one who doesn't thing that camping out on the lawn on a hot day is a pretty normal thing to do, that having dirty dishes in the sink and lazy people who have no interest in washing them is pretty typical?) by someone who may have been given some good source material but still seems to not be able to do anything with it this book is for you. Burroughs self-obsession with the drivel he writes about his lifeseems to be most notable for the fact that he dropped out of high school and did nothing for several years. What Burroughs does demonstrate is a strong gift for marketing - not only did he get an ad agency to sign him in NYC but he was able to get some publisher to actually publish this book. Glad I just found it lying around an airline bathroom and didn't actually spend real money on it."
1,running with scissors,"One of the most offensive things I have ever encountered. With this type of literature and movies, we don't need war, Hitler or anything else. We can destroy ourselves without help. The movie was as shameful as the book. Complete lack of story material, offensive; Annette Benning has finally proven to everyone that she is very good at being a lunatic. If this is the only thing Hollywood can do, and rewards the actors for taking parts in it, I say we go back to the old system where the studios made sure that families can once again go to the movies. Benning should hang her head in shame knowing that her children will see what she promotes."
1,TERRIBLE,i read the authors brothers book and it was far better than this disgrace to mankind. do not read. this book is vile and innapropriate and shouldnt be allowed in amazon
1,Never Received Book,It's October 7 and I ordered the book on Sept. 5. I still have not received the book. My book club met last Wednesday. So disapointed!
1,ugh!,"My poor husband bought this book as a gift because the reviews said it was funny. I didn't laugh at all, and I would never recommend this book to anyone. It is sad, offensive, and poorly written. I finsihed it hoping there was some kind of great ending, but I wasn't that lucky. Anyone who thinks this book is funny scares me."
2,"Not funny, not entertaining","This book is just mildly amusing & more disturbing than anything else. There is one ""gross out"" scene after another not to mention pedophilia, coprophilia, substance abuse, animal cruelty, rape, & child abuse. This is supposed to be funny?Perhaps it would be a more bearable read if the author were somewhat articulate, but regrettably, this is not the case.If you are looking for a really funny read in this vein, try David Sedaris."
1,Simply Horrible,"I only read the first 6 chapters and had to stop. Each chapter was leading you further down with the bottom nowhere in sight. Like some stunt from Fear Factor, the author makes you wade through a pool of filth to gather the randomly placed 'nuggets' of humorous or otherwise emotionally touching moments. I finally had to drop out.Early in the book you are treated to such gems as the ""Masturbatorium"" chapter where his parents' therapist describes the acts he performs alone in his special room with photos of Golda Meir. From there, each chapter tries to outdo the one that came before it. Truly a race not just to the bottom, but somewhere way below it. Many passages left me with that feeling I've sometimes experienced after a very long plane ride: I just wanted to take a shower and put on some clean clothes."
1,Perhaps others have loved it...,"... and certainly several of my friends did and recommended it highly to me, but I didn't enjoy the half of this book I managed to get through before putting it down permanently. I don't know whether it was because of the highly-detailed abuse it contained, but as a mother of two young children I kept thinking, where the heck is social services? When is someone going to rescue Augusten? What is wrong with these people? Perhaps it was my inability to get out of ""mom mode"" but it nauseated me and made me very very sad."
1,"Overhyped , depressing,""Sex & the College Town""","Have to admit, I read only half the book, then stopped. Kept wondering ""Exactly where is it suppose to get funny? When the boy's describing the forced oral sex? or when his dad is getting drunk and physically abusing his mom?"" I skipped to the end to see if it got any better, and it doesn't. There's gay erotica out there that's not as descriptive as this book! Very misleading, and very disappointing."
2,"No really, this is not good!","A very bizzare book, poorly written in an uninteresting style even while describing unspeakable horros being planned by young and old alike. Psychiatirist who takes in a child patient and allow him to to be molested in his own house, encourages his own 13 year daughter to have an affair with a 40 year old man with a dowry, mothers who think nothing of being caught inflagranto delcto with her female lover by her 15 year son and so on. No connection in these stories other than to shock. No literature, no laughs. nothing but a waste on money."
1,Less than one star,"This book may have been hailed as a memoir, but it was also not only disturbing, but borderline pornographic. I took this book on vacation and ended up throwing it away half-way through because it was just too graphic and pointless. Seems the author was more concerned with shock value and self-disclosure, than in having it make a point or comment on mental illness and/or dysfunctional parenting. I kept waiting for it to have some meaning, but instead it just became more pornographic as it continued. A crewmember on the ship I was vacationing on saw me reading it and commented that he was just as disturbed. That's when I finally decided my impression was not off, despite the ""great"" reviews and praise for the movie. YUCK!"
2,bored,"i read this whole book trying to figure out what everyone was raving about and i still don't know. i was not offended by his attempts to find humor in what was an extremely abusive situation. sometimes, his witty perspective is interesting. but about three quarters of this book should have been cut because it simply isn't interesting. in what is essentially a collection of connected short stories, there might be five worth reading."
2,Reads like a tawdry after-school special,"yes, it's got some funny situations and it's got some ""interesting"" characters. but it just felt artless. it's written without much nuance and i did not feel any sympathy for any of the characters. it felt forced. sorry - i don't get what the hype is all about."
2,Disappointed,"I was excited to read this book, I thought it would be a good laugh after reading the reviews. I was disappointed. The book was more disturbing than funny. Infact there were very few funny parts in the book at all. It was captivating in a dark way, at times I found it hard to put down. But it is certainly a book I would not go out of my way to recommend for someone to read."
5,profoundly disturbing...but in a good way,"Once I opened this book I could not put it down. I was instantly intrigued by the quirkiness of this young boy thrown into a life that is so far from ""normal"" it almost makes you feel uncomfortable. Augusten Burroughs has an amazing way of describing madness, love, sex, and beauty as they intertwine within one another. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone."
1,sad,I guess the literary world may find this book funny but as a medical professional I found it very sad. Writing it may have been therapeutic for the author but how other people found it entertaining is beyond me. I felt the author was trying to shock the reader more than anything. I am beyond being shocked.
4,Interesting and Disturbing,"This is a disturbing account of Augusten Burroughs childhood.His mother is a whacked out artist and his father was a unloving jerk.He was sent to live his mothers ""psychiatrist"" and his family full of misfits.It is funny at times, but overall a depressing memoir.Its sad to read about his troubled childhood, and how he basically was sent into a world all on his own.I would definately reccommend this book, especially so you can read DRY, which is the follow up to Running with Scissors.If you enjoy the author, this lays the blueprint for all of his other novels/memoirs."
1,Disheartening,"From the reviews and buzz, I expected a memoir along the lines of a David Sedaris piece. Instead, this was a sad portrait of a self-absorbed, disturbed psuedo-clan. Lacking in wit, insight or any redeeming characters, it's apparently also dishonest -- not a real memoir, but a piece of fiction loosely based on a few facts, a la ""A Million Little Pieces"". It's simply not worth the effort."
4,disturbingly great,read this for a book club; we all liked it a ton and enjoyed re-telling our favorite parts to each other in disbelief that it really happened. my co-worker on the other hand hated it (reminded her too much of her own childhood??) i guess you'll either love it or hate it.
4,"You Don't Want to Laugh, But You Do","This is one of the saddest books I think I've ever read. What happened to the author in his childhood is a horrible account of abuse and molestation. Yet, he makes his story glow and crafts even the most monsterous characters into real humans. I guess it's true that which does not kill you makes you strong...it also can make you hysterically funny and makes for a fascinating read."
2,Overrated,"Another book hopping on the ""my life is screwed up because of my childhood/adolescence"" ficto-auto-biography wagon.The book reads almost formulaically, in the vein of Sedaris. I didn't find the writing interesting or engaging or particularly humorous."
4,"If you like weird, this is a book full of weird","Personally, I preferredHello Dolly: Growing up in the late 1930s in Fall River, Massachusettsas an honest memoir that connects better with reality. Hello Dolly draws you in and keeps you in its world. Running with scissors seems to have come from another planet where every moment is a wacky weird adventure. That makes for a very fun read, but at times it's hard to believe. I'm not accusing Burroughs of making this stuff up, I'm saying, even if this were presented as a work of fiction, there are times when you fall out of the story space because it seems too unrealistic. That said, I enjoyed reading the book and had a hard time putting it down. Depressing, but funny."
3,Not His Best Work,"I would like to start by saying that I LOVE Augusten Burroughs, his perspective, and his sharp wit. Unlike many people, ""Running With Scissors"" was not the first of Burrough's books that I read. While I found the book to be enjoyable enough, well written in a way that did not try to elicit pity where pity was clearly deserved, and an easy read, I have preferred every one of his other books to this one.It's something I can't quite place my finger on that seemed to be absent from this book and not from his others. It's worth a read, if only to gain perspective and insight into the person he becomes and discusses in the rest of his books."
3,Not exactly a heart warming story...,"I had read somewhere that this book would inspire people who grew up with a dyfunctional background to realize that a ""normal"" adulthood was still possible. That is mostly why I bought the book. While I still think it was worth reading, I have to say the book was more disturbing than inspiring. The fact that the author really only tells the story as a matter-of-fact, and offers no real insight into how he survived it all was disappointing. There were sections of the book that literally turned my stomach and others that had me outraged. It proves that fact is very much stranger than fiction sometimes. Again, worth the read, but it's not for the tender-hearted."
4,"Touching, wacky story","While reading this book, I found myself continually feeling an odd mix of horror and amusement. Burroughs tells here, with great humor and insight, the very personal story of all the abuse and neglect he suffered at the hands of his emotionally disturbed mother and her even more disturbed psychiatrist. At times I found myself wondering whether the peculiar things he describes could actually have happened. But who am I to question the veracity of this touching memoir?I read this book ages ago, and Burroughs' story haunts me still."
4,"not hilarious, but fun.","I laughed all right. But it wasn't hilarious for me. I thought it was a bit disturbing, kind of hard to believe sometimes, but interesting. At times, it just looked somewhat like the story of a wild wild life that would not reach anywhere, so this made me feel tired. But in the end, it was overall a fun book to read.As for the language, the readability is amazingly easy and makes you really get into the book."
4,Running With Scissors,"Running With Scissors is a very intersting read, the author has risen above incredible odds. Well written and an eye opener regarding his upbringing."
3,Strange,"I am a little bit surprised that he was able to keep his sanity, but I suppose one can adjust to anything if you start early enough.Would still recommend though."
3,buzz,I had heard the buzz about this and had to read it. It was okay but really strange. I am glad I read it but do not necessarily feel compelled to read any of his other books.
4,Amazingly Entertaining Train Wreck,Reading this book filled me with two simultaneous and contradictory emotions. Envy. I wish my childhood was one tenth as entertaining as his was. And Gratitude. I'm really glad my childhood was so normal that it's not worth talking about. His story is that interesting and is definitely worth the read. Picture a Dickensian orphan's tale as told by the cast of a spinoff of the Mary Tyler Moore show.
4,a tough person,"I really hope Augusten Burroughs feels good about himself after all he went through and the terrible, morbid childhood he'd had. I'm glad he wrote the book hoping he'd got it out of his system and would live happily ever after. From my heart I wish him all the best.Read the book, and put yourself in his shoes and try growing up to be a writer living a normal life.. that's the biggest challenge.."
1,Overhyped...,I was told this book was hilarious and laugh out loud funny. I got through it after having to put it down several times because it was disgusting and not funny at all...I was not pleased after completing it and saddened by what stands for humor - not close to Sedaris...
1,obnoxious,"someone i trusted recommended i read this. he said i would find it hilarious and that the humor entailed was right up my alley. after reading this, i was offended to say the least. this book was not funny or believable. aside from it not being the least bit humorous, i found the characters (especially the narrator) to be completely obnoxious and self absorbed. there was nothing likable about anyone in the book. the adults are irresponsible and the kids are unmotivated, destructive and hateful. also, i do not for one minute believe that half this stuff really happened and the author must think that we are idiots to try and dish this out as a ""memoir""."
1,A waste of time,I fought my way through this book hoping to find the 'humor' which others have found. I'm somewhat insulted by the comparisons between this author and David Sedaris; the Sedaris' books are touching and funny. This book isn't. I'm amazed at a novelist who can quote 'verbatim' conversations which occurred tweny-five years earlier. Do not waste your time with this book.
1,Mislead,"My book club is very surprised that not one write-up mentioned the homosexual theme or rough language. Our group has been meeting and discussing literature for over ten years and have enjoyed a wide range of books. The author showed a high grade of talent in describing his dysfunctual childhood and in making the characters vivid. However, the details got to be a bit too much, especially the episode with the feces examination. Most of my group tired of the craziness and stopped reading. For those of us who finished, it was unbelievable and distasteful. We would never recommend it and would prefer returning our copies to the vendor who sold them to us. Suggest the author use his talents in developing fiction."
1,Running with scissors,I am in 2 book clubs and read a great deal of books. This is the worst book that I have ever read. I had to stop reading it after 40 pages. It was too descriptive and was all about child molestation. I would not recommend this book to anyone!
1,""" A REAL LOSER ""","I DOUBT IF THIS WILL BE PRINTED BUT, THIS BOOK IS A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY . APPARENTLY HOLLYWOOD DOING WHAT IT DOES BEST ...SHOWING, SEX, SUBSTANCE ABUSE, CAR CRASHES,& VIOLENCE , JUMPED ALL OVER THIS BOOK AND MADE IT INTO A MOVIE . WELL FOLKS IT FLOPPED, AS IT DESERVED .APPARENTLYPEOPLE ARE GETTING TOO SMART TO FALL FOR TRASH . GOOD FOR THEM !WHILE NO CAR CRASHES WERE IN THE BOOK THERE WAS ENOUGH VERY DISTURBING MATERIAL . SOME FOLKS TRIED TO COMPARE THIS BOOK TO ""DAVID SEDARIS "" SENSE OF HUMOR...WELL HE HAS NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT, HIS WORK IS TRULY FUNNY WHILE THIS IS JUST DISTURBING .SAVE YOUR MONEY !!! I WISH I DID ."
2,Would not recommend,"I bought this book not knowing anything about the story other than that it was a memoir. I did not find any part of this book funny and I am surprised that anyone could or did. Augusten endured a horibble childhood at a terrible cost. The fact that he survived it is a miracle; it is obvious to me that he paid a terrible price. The writing is very detached and rather than feel as if Augusten was telling the story, it seemed it was someone else. There are many times he describes how he detached himself from the events that were happening in his life. This is a common response to abuse and emotional neglect. I, too, wondered when just ONE responsible adult would step in and save not only Augusten but the children of Dr. Finch, who obviously was completely nuts himself. I thought the sexually explicit nature of some of the narrative was unnecessary and offensive--too much information. I can't recommend this book."
4,good writer,"overall, interesting read...writer kept the story moving with enough, but not too much boring details. i'm usually prefer history or other non-fiction books, but I would recommend this to friends/family."
3,Amazon book purchase,"This was the first book that I read by this author. You have to be prepared for some graphic homosexual portions. I found that he was all over the place with his writing, but I still enoyed the book and went on to purchase the rest of his books. He is amusing in parts of the book, but I don't find him ""one of America's 15 funniest people""."
2,a bit overblown,"i think there is such thing as too blase, too nonchalant. the book itself was okay, but i thought there was very little substance to it. you knew what was going on, but not how the ""protaganist"" was actually feeling, or how he was affected. most of the time memoirs have some goal in mind, this one seemed to have only one goal and it was a slight one at that; to shock you and amaze you. there was very little emotional depth, and i found that disappointing."
1,Funny? I don't think so,"I consider myself to have a dark sense of humor but this book wasn't funny, it was just plain tragic. I finally chucked it about halfway through because it was making me ill. I'm completely stunned by the positive reviews this book received. Most of all, I'm astounded that this book has been marketed as ""funny."""
1,Waiting for the musical,"Where's the humor? This book is not funny, it's ridiculous. If you are the type of person who can find humor in a grisly train wreck, then you'll love this book. If there's any truth to the story at all, I believe it's been embellished until it's unrecognizable. I didn't finish the book - I'm waiting for the musical, or perhaps the comedy channel will pick it up. The same people who laugh uncontrollably at a 12-year-old in a movie who blurts out gratuitous, vulgar expletives will find this story to be an over-the-top, knee-slapping hoot."
3,Dirty Birdy,"I read Burroughs' memoir over a three-night period. Each night, I endured the most twisted dreams, and I blame them on the disturbing tales that I still cannot completely believe. The best part of the novel was his adroit ability to seemlessly weave in yummy morsels of 70s pop culture; if you're looking for a fond recollection, however, look elsewhere. His text has some vivid images (sexual assault, God-inspired defecations, psychotic lesbian mom with the minister's wife) that are not for the faint-hearted."
2,Submission at the YELLow Submarine,"The truth, as is say, IS stranger than fiction. Destruction and insanity of the most pernicious kind proliferate at the hands of the insane Dr. Finch. Unfortunately, the author's version of the truth is full of denial and nescience of the perverted consequences one evil man had in the lives of many who trusted him, including his own family..."
1,"Disturbing, gross, and badly written!","I really wanted to read this book since it made the number one bestseller list for the New York Times, so I bought this book from my local bookstore and since I was going on a flight to Dallas I thought that maybe I could bring this along. I started to read this and at first it was interesting but as you cross one hundred pages the memoir shows its true colors.The book goes into so many disturbing sequences its hard to find a spot that doesnt contain it, its wrong and its described so graphic, I immediately threw this book into the thrash can and later I could never get it out of my head because it just made me feel very disgusted.If you dont mind reading about mature topics and if you(the reader) enjoy twisted books then go for it, otherwise if you dont then your taking a risk when you start reading this book, its pretty disgusting."
1,I simply can't go on...,"reading this piece of trash. I love to read and am very open minded but this author goes too far. Reading about the vulgar, obscene, pitiful, sorrowful situations made me feel nauseous and horrified. I kept thinking it would improve but....it did not. Seriously--just looking at the cover turns my stomache.If you want to read a truly stunning memoir try, ""The Glass Castle"" by Jeanette Walls."
1,Running with Scissors,"(dysfunctional, even criminal) I can usually find humor in dark situations, but with this book, not only did I find it not funny but there was not a person in the book that cared about or liked. I thought this book was so bad it had the sour milk effect on me (take a drink say ewwww, taste this). Yes I have told others to read this book just to see if they thought it was as bad as I did. I guess misery does love company."
4,Wow.,I was alternately laughing out loud and gasping in horror. The author is immensely talented and it is a wonder he made it out the other side to adulthood.
3,"Disturbing, but hilarious!","This book took me only a few hours to read. Although the story is much to stomach; believe me, this novel will have you engrossed the entire time."
2,gosh!,"I really wanted to like this book! The premise just seemed so good! But, I found it so hard to get through, and rather disturbing and sad (not in a good way!) There were some aspects that could have been really comedic, but I feel they fell flat for me!"
5,You GOTTA read it!,"This book is impossible to put down. It's non-stop craziness from cover to cover. Unbelievable entertaining, although sometimes I question how 100% accurate this memoir is, if only because I can't believe one person went through all this! Not for the squeamish. Some serious isht happens to this guy but at least he can laugh about it an make us laugh too. Awesome book."
4,"disturbing, not entertaining","If I were rating this book for the pleasure I personally received from reading it I would give it one star; but rating the book for the quality of the book it deserves 4 to 4 1/2 stars. The book was highly disturbing because it involved reading about a multitude of emotional and psychological sins committed against a young boy while he endures growing up in a highly dysfunctinal family. I have read the editorial reviews about the book's entertainment value but then you would have to enjoy an ongoing tale where you feel deeply sorry for what the parents (mostly the mother) of the main character does to her defenseless son. The author certainly gets you to strongly ""feel"" a variety of emotions for and about the characters and with that in mind the book is excellent."
5,Excellent,This is a memoir like no other. Heartbreaking yet fabulous. Burroughs' original writing style paired with the memoir's stranger-than-fiction content will truly take your breath away.
2,high on shock but don't expect to take anything away...,"the book is definitely a page turner, but don't look for anything to really touch you with the characters that surrounded his life, or in his complete lack of any reflection on the events and people that shaped his childhood. unlike say, a Sedaris story - there doesn't seem to be much humanity in this memoir. I don't know - maybe that's not exactly the point of this book (or it IS!) but by the time I read the exerpt from his book Dry - I was convinced that he's only in it for the satisfaction of grossing his reader's out...."
4,Unique,"Augusten has lead a very abnormal life. His story was very interesting. It was very direct and blunt. Although his life was far from normal growing up, his story gives you an insight and a realization that other people lead very different lives then any one person might be used to. Throughout the book, the chaos and craziness, is what becomes normal to him. I am very excited to read his other book ""Dry."""
3,Read with caution.......,"I haven't finished the book yet, but I wanted to be sure to get the word out that this book is not for the faint at heart. It is vulgar, crude, and utterly unbelievable! The intrigue is that it's true and amazingly well written. It's so bizarre there are times I wonder if all of it is, in fact, true. It's amazing to me that this man has not killed himself. He states he has thought about suicide but there is always tomorrow and tomorrow must be better than today. A good lesson. I recommend the book but with caution for language and sexual content."
3,Not For the Sensitive People,"Running with Scissors was a funny book only because you know that the author managed to survive his childhood. If you're the sensitive type, I wouldn't recommend this book. If you're a reader who had a similarly ""twisted"" childhood and have come away from it with a sense of humor, then this book is for you."
1,Disappointment,"Beware readers...this book is not all hilarity and out-loud guffaws. I bought the book based on the blurbs on the cover, expecting a David Sedaris type book. There were moments of humor, but the overall feeling the book left with me was a troubled one--thoughts of broken lives and seriously disturbed individuals. Let me clarify that I am far from prudish, but I fail to see any humor whatsoever in the adult sanctioning of abusive sexual relationships with underage adolescents.It's even more disturbing to realize this is a memoir and not a work of fiction. Perhaps it would better serve as a ""beware of therapists"" tome rather than as a book promoted to be filled with hilarious coming-of-age tales."
3,Not sure how funny or amusing it is...,"If the situations in this book are real, there is no place for laughter. Abuse is nothing to joke about and so far I haven't found any part of this book amusing.I think it's sad that a person was treated in such a way to be abandoned by his mother and father and then to be raised by an even crazier family. It's almost unfathomable the conditions that went on in this book.I've read many abuse type books and this is the first one that didn't even match what the cover of the book stated. Amusing, not in the least. It was a very sad situation for the main character as well as the other family portrayed in this book. It should be regarded as what it is - a memoir of abuse which happens all too frequently. It's not something to laugh at."
2,No David Sedaris...,"I found this book too disturbing and rarely funny. Burroughs is often compared to David Sedaris. Well David Sedaris' ""Me Talk Pretty One Day"" is one of my favorite books - but I just could not find the humor in Burroughs' memoir."
2,Good try..but,"This story just seemed ""forced."" I have tried to read and finish this book at least 5 times and have finally given up. It is like a bad sitcom that won't go away...If you want real laughs, twisted wit and something that goes a step beyond this- read David Sedaris. I haven't given up on this author, but I need to move on."
2,I didn't get it.,"I really didn't find this book funny in any way. I smiled a few times but was mostly disturbed. I have read a lot of great reviews of this book so maybe it just didn't jibe with my sense of humor/sensibility. I would, however, call it an interesting, well written look into the world of mental illness I had never really delved into before."
1,Skip it unless you like books because you're supposed to.,I can only guess that the reason this book is receiving so many good reviews is because it appeals to the victimization trend that seems to pervade our society. The only thing this book seems to offer is a portrayal of a lot of really screwed up people with a twisted view of life. How the jacket has the audacity to compare this to David Sedaris is beyond me. None of the characters is appealing nor is there a major conflict to be resolved. It's also poorly written.It just seems to be poorly disguised pornography except for the fact that pornography is meant to excite the reader and the repeated sex scenes are huge turnoffs. Sex is described as something unpleasant to be tolerated because at least it's not boring.Save your money or go buy a Sedaris book if you want to enjoy reading about dysfunctional people.
1,Dreadful,"I borrowed this book to read on a flight and after persevering through half of it I slipped it into the seat pocket in front of me for the next passenger. Written clearly to shock and amuse it basically catalogues a series of highly improbable and mostly disturbing incidents, sprinkled with scenes of unnecessarily gratuitous sex. The psychiatrist patriarch was a character of interest and the main reason, along with misleading praise on the back cover, for my bothering past the second page."
1,Not in the same league,To compare David Sedaris to Augusten Burroughs is to compare Woody Allen to Adam Sandler.
1,Just plain disturbing,"This is one of the few books in my life that I could not finish. How anyone could find it amusing is beyond me. I got about halfway through, expecting some redeeming value in it due to the many good reviews, and also because I have enjoyed several other memoirs recently (The Liar's Club, The Glass Castle, Oh The Glory of It All, all of which I highly recommend).However, when the psychiatrist he is living with starts reading meaning into his bowel movements, and has his adult daughter scoop them out of the toilet and save them on the backyard picnic table (no, I'm not making this up), I could not bear it any longer. It doesn't matter whether the story is true or not. This is nothing but trash."
2,Dismal and Dark,"Told from the perspective of a young man coming to grips with his homosexuality, this memoir is a horrifying account of alcoholism, molestation, mental illness and abandonment in the setting of an intensely dysfunctional childhood.Some have compared Burroughs' strong prose to that of David Sedaris, but Burroughs' is much, much darker. He hits all the politically correct notes, however, which may explain his success. As a result, the reissue of this bestselling book may reach a new crop of readers - or not. Personally, despite an affection for humorous stories about crazy families, I found this to be extremely depressing."
4,"At times, funny, but I skipped some","I lived in Northampton, Mass., once where this memoir is set. Often, I saw Finch, the crazy psychiatrist dressed like Santa Claus strolling downtown. I enjoyed the local mentions sprinkled throughout this youth memoir of a highly dysfunctional family. There were several or more chapters that I thought were tedious and I simply skimmed them. But there are others that are quite humorous. The author has a nicely ironic style."
4,"Disturbingly Hilarious, Sad, and Honest- All at the Same Time","This was an interesting and sad but also hilarious memoir. At the age of 12 Augusten Borrough's mother gave him to her crazy psychiatrist to raise. Augusten finds himself in a strange old house with a whole bizarre cast of characters.I was quite intrigued by this story, and horrified and amazed that it was actually true; that his mother left him to live there. But I suppose there's nothing technically illegal about it. Anyways, it was an incredible story of survival in extraordinary circumstances, and I enjoyed the way Burroughs described the different people he meets at the psychiatrist's house.*You can read all of my reviews at my book review blog, novareviews.blogspot.com*"
5,Be Afraid. Be Very Afraid!,"Why? Memoirs frighten me. You never know what you're going to encounter. I think that is the intrigue with the lives of others. It's like watching a train wreck. Even though it's horrific, you just gotta see with your own two eyes. We are truly breathing the same air.Masturbatorium... I'm literally dying of out loud laughter over here. I think the kids think I've finally gone mad. I certainly wouldn't be the first mother to lose her g.d mind. Ha ha. #DierdreThis was an excellent 2nd choice for FreedomInk's 1st Annual Reading is Retro Summer Challenge. I'm so glad my dear friend had an extra copy. My 2 cents (review)? The details are so freaky and bizarre! I can't imagine it being a movie! There are some things viewers are bound to miss. If only you read the book... I'm a fan. Running With Scissors by Augusten Burroughs is delivered with literary precision!"
1,boring,"I read this book awhile ago. And hated it. I thought it was one of the most self-indulgent, tiresome, bleak, gross (as in ""yech"") books I've ever read.I'm sick of disgusting and depressing being touted as deep."
2,Frayed topsy turvy anecdotes,"Pretty brutal homosexual coming of age, where the age is compassionately on the lower bounds and the backdrop is a symphony of chaos. The Finch family would have been deemed unlikely, had I not personally encountered (and intimately engaged with) a similarly alien family as an exchange student.I was not impressed, although the book was readable."
4,Good but leans on humor too much,Good but I feel as if Humor too much of a theme and doesn't focus much on the overall story. Its really jsut a crutch. Aside from that its good.
2,Poor narration - semi-interesting story - repulsive details,"This was semi-interesting. Some of the more graphic descriptions of homosexual sex escapades didn't border on repulsive - they WERE actually repulsive (e.g. talking about brown smears on underwear - too much unnecessary information). The story would have been interesting, but the disgusting parts were so distracting to me that they overtook any interest I had in what was going on. Also, the narrator is probably the least talented audiobook narrator I've heard to date. His delivery seems very stiff and uncomfortable. He definitely didn't make the book any easier to listen to. Overall, I feel like this is nine hours of my life that I'll never get back."
4,Read it in 2 days ...,"It was a very interesting book and had no problems plowing through it 2 days. It's kind of like a car wreck you don't realy want to look but you just can't help yourself.This book was very graffic at times and I can imagine some people may have a hard time with this stuff. But, for me, it was a very good read."
5,Run into a grippingly Mad World,"Warped and Enthralling, Running with Scissors sucked me along--each odd event out-doing the last. The characters are so stark and richly developed that you can almost touch the hunchbacked mother, Agnes, sweeping absently around the 7 month old christmas tree. So many great quotes from that book, so many moments that make you want to yell--beware of reading it in public, or you may be locked away yourself!"
1,Junk,"Crap. What a waste of time. I am actually embarassed to say I read this one. The good thing was it was a quick read, due to the simplicity of his vocabulary. This was due to his poor education, which was due to his own lack of motivation. The worst thing about this book and his story, is how he turns on the family who essentially adopted him. This family treated him like one of their own, yet he seems to be much more forgiving to the Child molestor he had an affair with. Plain garbage."
1,God-Awful,I'm still trying to figure out why people think this book is funny. Perhaps it's because they are so desperate to find someone with a more screwed up life & upbringing than their own that they can laugh at this sickness in this child's life? Ugh. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. This book is disturbing and not in a good way.
3,More disturbing and sad than humorous,"This book was recommended to me by a friend who said it was hysterical but it actually turned out to be very disturbing and actually quite sad. There were some parts that were funny but overall I found it pretty disturbing that this young boy was molested at the age of 12, was dumped off by his psychopathic mother at a roach infested crazy house (while she went out and had sex with a married woman and then a woman half her age), and was forced to perform oral sex on a man more than twice his age numerous times. Seeing how this is a memoir, sorry if I don't see the humor in that."
5,Weird but could not put down!!,"Sure there are some raunchy scenes in the book but it's a man telling us about his childhood. If it happened, which I believe it did---then why not tell it the way he saw it then??If he embellished people would still be complaining saying he is a liar-- so he tells the truth and people say it's too awful to read..go figure!Personally I loved it and I'm buying DRY tomorrow."
1,running with scissors,"I found this book ugly and plodding. I can't imagine anyone comparing this author to David Sedaris. I did not find any humor whatsoever in this memoir. In my 18 years experience as a child protection social worker, I have been exposed to much more suffering than what is so graphically described in this book and don't have a thin skin, but this book left me cold."
1,"Horrible book, horrible.","THis book was horrible. If it was possible to rate it lower than one star i would have. I am an avid reader and picked this book up after my mom had gotten it from a friend. I read half of it, suffering from a headache the entire time, and then got to the part about the relationship the 13 year old boy had with a 33 year old man and i lit this book on fire. One less copy in the world...don't waste your money.I wish i had the time spent reading this book back so i could use it for better purposes. THis book wasted my life."
1,Run with your scissors to cut up this book!,"Totally, a waste of time and reading. Augusten Burroughs should refund my money. Perhaps I'm still living in Puritanical America, but the graphic descriptions of homosexual acts was unnecessary and served only to shock the reader. Likewise, the bathroom humor, and continued used of 4 letter obscenities does not perform any literary service.I would not recommend this book for anyone under the age of 21.It's really not even worthy of review."
1,VERY DISTURBING,"This book is utterly and completely disturbing. As a teacher, and mother of a young son, I read this book feeling more and more horrified as each chapter went on. In the reviews they say that the book is ""hilarious"" and ""insanely funny."" Well, I think that you'd have to be insane to find this kind of abuse and neglect in any way humorous. I felt worse as a person for just having read the book. Really all I can say is that it is a sick and disturbing book that is not really suitable for the general population. Yuck!"
3,"Readable, but flawed","Running with Scissors is certainly engaging. Who could turn away from the train wreck that is Burroughs' childhood? It's a page turner because you almost can't wait to find out what new atrocity has bloomed in his life. It's like reading a diary - and who can honestly say that's not fun? However, I was a little put off by Burroughs' infatuation with himself. While a healthy self-esteem is admirable and even envied, Burroughs at times becomes too enamored of the wonder that is Augusten. I guess it's a good thing he loved/loves himself, though. This poor guy wasn't exactly nurtured."
4,BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN AND YET HORRIBLY SHOCKING,"If you think you have had a messed up childhood, after reading this book, yours would be so easy in comparison. Augusten Burroughs, in his memoir, tells us about his twisted nightmare of an upbringing, by his mother, her psychiatrist, and the doctor's weird family.This story would leave anyone else grabbing their knees, bending over at times and feeling sick!!! Burroughs manages to tell the story with wit and humour, and honesty. We all have childhood memories we like to keep hidden, but I give Burroughs a lot of credit for exposing his abused childhood so candidly. It's amazing that his life turned out so well after such an abused upbringing. There are graphic homosexual scenes in this story of a very young teen and his lover who is 33 years old.Beautifully written and yet horribly shocking and disgusting at times. It is a difficult book to listen to, but one you will find yourself racing through to the finish line."
1,Running with Scissors,What a piece of trash! It might be somewhat humorous if it was fiction but the fact that it's true makes it just plain sick. Save your time and money.
2,Tragic,"The author's childhood was tragic and he was surrounded by insane and irresponsible people. He was the victim of child abuse and I found this memoir sad and scary. I did not like the writing style . I rather recommend Glass Castle which was also about a disfunctional family but was not quite as tragic , well written and was funny."
3,Augusten,"If it wasn't a memoir I would have thought it gratuitous and tossed it aside! The fact that this is a true stroy makes it so very shocking. I went from finding it humorous to wanting to cry for the young Augusten. And I thought MY family was a freak show!!!Well written with an amazing outlook on the authors part, a tribute to what the human child can endure. His realisation towards the end that if he could survive his childhood he could survive anything resonated.I can't help but think a lot of the rave reviews are more about the amazing events described than the author's writing ability."
3,Had its moments,"I opened this book with anticipation after reading so many positive reviews but did not find the humor in it. The incidents were portrayed in a humorous fashion but I found them too sad and horrific to be funny. As a memoir of a crazy childhood it fell below books like the Liars Club or A Monk Swimming, which I really enjoyed. I felt too sad for the author to reallly enjoy reading the book though it was well written and he obviously lived through the experience since he is now an adult. I did read the book all the way through, which I seldom do now...."
2,"All Flash , No Heart","This book is packaged as a memoir of sorts ,but it reads more like a John Irving novel in early pre development . Flatly episodic , each page seems to be trying to be more outragous than the last , but unlike the typical Irving novel ,there is no build up ,little character devolpment ,and after a time the reader grows weary of incidents which try too hard to be shocking.What is mostly lacking though in this supposed memoir is any true picture of the individuals involved ,any sense of sympathy for them as people - instead we are left with one strange incident after another ,an example of which finds various characters attempting to divine the future from their [excrement] ;indeed an entire chapter is given over to detailing this dubious eneterprise.Finally , Scissors is like a Henny Youngman vaudeville routine - occassional flashes of humor escape from onslaught, but in the end what we are left with is an empty and unsatisfying experience , all flash and no heart."
4,Coming of Age in a Distorted World,"This memoir provides unusual insight into the distortion of mental illness: what's feels ""normal"" truly isn't normal within the standards western society. Mr. Burroughs is buffeted by love that abandons, love that controls, love that abuses. Yet, he survives and many times is the only sane person in his world.Amusing, heartbreaking, at times uncomfortable, finally hopeful.Running with Scissors (great title!) expands your perspective and in the end leaves you with a greater capacity for compassion to fellow man. Childhood can be hell, some worse that others.p.s. For a novel with similar themes, check out White Oleander by Janet Fitch"
2,Don't Be Fooled By His Brilliant Storytelling,"Although Augusten Burroughs is a brilliant storyteller, I just couldn't get past the first third of the book. It was too toxic, and I'm not talking about the toxicity of the subject matter. The toxicity: The author is exploiting his own story - the story of his horrendous childhood of abuse - for twisted and immature motives. He writes with a lack of perspective and a lack of a healing message, and for me that makes his story non-redemptive. It's like junk food - the value is in the flavor and the crunch, not in the nutrition. Not surprising that he was successful in advertising.Part of why I didn't finish it, however, is that I already read the whole of his brilliant but ultimately vapid semi-sequel, ""Dry,"" and I wasn't about to get fully fooled a second time. I hoped this book would be different. It wasn't."
1,Hilarious??,"I take exception to those who deemed this book ""hilarious""...far from it. I rated the book one star, not because of the talent that it took to produce it, but because the content is so shockingly painful to read. It was like trying to watch someone perform surgery on themselves. This is supposed to be funny?? Why? I know animals who are treated with more care and love than the narrator of this memoir. And I should be laughing over this....I think not."
4,HOT TO DEATH,These shoes are HOT HOT HOT SEXY SEXY SEXY.... but they are NARROW...AND I even went up two sizes to try to fit them...boo hoo...they are still sexy and if you have a narrow foot you'll get lots of attention from wearing them.
1,Idiot's Guide to the Big Book,I didn't think much of this book. It was just a copy of the original multilith with a few comments reiterating obvious statements in the Big Book. I got nothing out of this book.
1,Stay away from this book!,"I am thoroughly unimpressed with the author and publisher of this book. It is reprehensable to declare right on the title that the book is a 'companion' to the Big Book. In fact, the only true companion is the 12 and 12, authorized by the New York office. The title and the content are dangerously misleading because they 'appear' to follow AA principles, but an ulterior motive is present. Make no mistake about it: this book is meant to lead the recovering and vulnerable alcoholic down a path of indoctrination into a pseudo-faith cult. Believe me when I say that anything that 'helps' you not talk to your sponsor/sponsee is definately not of the program! Stay away!"
2,annotated aa handbook,"this is not the book pictured in the advertisement...I received a ""second edition"" which is totally different from what is advertised. There is a picture of the book ""first edition"" and I was sent a second edition with a totally different cover. I am not happy with this purchase, false advertising!!!!"
1,Can not recommend.,"I found the editing of this edition to be amateurish and poorly done (for instance, the last 30 or so pages are repeated).Anyone interested in the text of the First Edition would be better off using the Anonymous Press's reproduction."
2,not a one fit,"I bought this hat for my husband since he is very into the south florida bulls, but the hat is enormous on him. He wears a size 6 7/8 and the hat says it should fit, but definitely does not. I was very disappointed, i know he wanted one that seemed fitted, so i thought this one fit would be perfect i think it is really meant for the larger sizes."
1,very upset,When the ring came I thought it was beautiful but I noticed that some of the gems were loose. The NEXT day I wore it around and noticed one of the pink gems had already fallen out. A total waste of money.
4,Great,This product is really good of course its a lot more budget savy verses buying P90X or Insanity but just as good
3,Good price,I have yet to try it out. The price is fantastic and I love billy blanks workout. This was still brand new in the package too!
1,Don't waste your money,"I had high hopes for this video as most the Portrait of An Artist Series are quite good. However, nowhere on the video jacket, does it mention that most of it is in French or Spanish without English translation or subtitles. For the majority of audiences, wishing to learn more about Joan Miro, such as my Art of Spain students, it was not a good choice. We had just seen the A&E biography of Picasso which was so well done and were all very disappointed in this video. I have to admit that I stopped after one half hour."
3,Hard to read dial,I got this watch as a gift 2 years ago. It still works great. No problem with the crystal breaking and I don't mind the ticking noise(watches tick). I have a big problem with being able to read the dial in any low light situations. I like a watch that I can glance at and know the time. This is a major annoyance to me.
4,Great value,"Given the sale price of $55.00, how can one go wrong with this Skagen titanium men's watch."
2,First the good news,"I purchased 2 Skagen watches from Amazon, I think they have great styling, thin, very light weight and a good band. The problem is the crystal, my first one only lasted 2 and a half months. Cracked in half. NO warranty at all on the crystal. I have had dozens of watches from Timex to Rolex and never had this problem. The repair is $8.95 shipping plus $25,00 for the crystal. So how many stars? 5 for style, 1 for durability."
3,Nice but has flaws,"I've had this watch for several months. Over all it's a nice watch, very light and comfortable. Here's the bad, it's very noisy. Like others have mentioned the glass must have some very serious design and/or manufacturing flaw. I put my watch down on my desk came back several hours later and the crystal had cracked badly. I put it back in the original box until I had time to contact Skagen's customer service and I just looked at it a day later and the crack has gotten even worse. You're taking a gamble with this watch."
3,Liked my old Skagen better,"After 9 years, my old Skagen was ready to be put out to pasture (it still worked, but the crown wouldn't adjust the time). The 170LTTM was the closest I could find to a direct replacement, but I'm just not loving it. The crystal is slightly domed, which causes a lot of reflections, making it difficult to read in any light. Adding to that, the second hand is just as prominent as the minute hand, so taking a quick glance for the time isn't possible. On the plus side, the loud ticking that others have mentioned isn't a problem with mine, and the overall look is quite nice, and the finish is looking fine after several months. If my issues with the watch sound like nit-picking, then you can figure it rates at least 4 stars, probably 5.Update: After 2.5 years, the domed crystal completely split, shattering in a full circle, for no apparent reason. Given my issues with the watch in the first place, I'm not sorry to see this watch go."
5,Best Watch for the Cost,"I bought a Skagen 233LGSC and it's a Great Watch. I have several other watches (Movado, Rado, Citizen and a few more). I must say that I like this Skagen Watch the Best. It is very thin, Great looking and well built. The price of less than $100 WOW. I spent several times that amount on my other watches. I'm sure you will love a Skagen Watch."
3,Buy it somewhere else,"This is a great watch. I hate all of the large, heavy watches made for men. This one is a nice slim watch that doesn't get cought on shirt sleaves or feel like an arm iron. It looks good for casual or formal wear.I am disappointed with Amazon's price. It's not exceptionally good. The ripoff store at the mall has it for the same price, and after reading Jeff Bezos' introduction letter talking about how most jewelry stores have such high markups, I expected it to be less. Shop around online, I have seen it for 30% less. That more than covers the free shipping promo.Update:It looks like Amazon's price for this item, when purchased directly from them, has dropped. It might be a good price when you read this, but definitely shop around in case it goes back up."
2,Crystal is Fragile,"I've owned three of these watches and each one has had its crystal cracked. So, I finally got the hint and stopped buying them.It's a great watch, and very thin, very classy, but not durable in the least."
2,Crystal is really bad,"I had similar problem most of you got. I do not know what is the problem with Crystal of Skagen watches. I bought in 2003 Thanks giving week end at K's. Crystal was broke in Jan, 2004. So store manager sent for repair and got repaired. Luckly he didn't charge me because he understood my concern.Again after a year crystal was broken, I really worried about this time. So one day I found customer support number on Skagen website and called support person. I explained about the situation and I asked to talk to Manager. Manager was quite nice and she sent me new watch and asked me to return broken one. They have sent return envelope to do that. If you guys have similar problem, call skagen customer support."
1,"Versatile, elegant, but fRaGiLe!","I loved this watch. I'd been looking for a long time and when I found it I wanted it right away. It has a big, simple face and the band is a tight matte weave instead of glaring plated shine.But. The very first night when I set it gently on my bedside table, the entire crystal face cracked in a big circle all the way around. Warranty didn't cover problems with the face but the store owner took pity on me and gave me another. Two nights later I set the new one gently on the bedside table in the dark. When I woke up, the exact same pattern of catastrophic break.Now the owner said that nothing like that had ever happened before but it happened twice in a row and in very short order for me. If I were you I wouldn't risk it. You might not be lucky enough to get a refund."
1,skagen titanium,"Great looking watch, arrived quickly. Appearance is what I expected.BUT, the face/crystal is cracked. Is there a warranty?"
2,Noisy,"Like the looks of the watch. However, it's very noisy and the clasp tends to come apart after removing the watch. The face can also be difficult to read in bright light (reflection)."
3,Light and thin but loud,Watch is very light and thin but it has a very loud tick. The color of the titanium is nice. Can be sized for small or large wrists. Very good watch for any occasion.
5,My husband LOVES this watch!,"My husband has a smaller wrist, so big watches bug him and he takes them off when he golfs, etc... but this one he hardly feels so he just leaves it on. It's so versatile, you can dress it up or dress it down. Sleek.And now the price, in the $60's is unbeatable. We paid around $100 and it was still a good deal! I almost want to get a spare one."
2,Stylish but with a hitch,"I bought it as a replacement for a lost Skagen. I love its sleek and simple style. But the seconds hand was annoyingly loud, and I returned it. A pity that Skagen hasn't resolved this hitch."
4,Can Be Loud,"I bought this watch for the full $120 on a flight to Shanghai, and the receiver loves it. The main reason why I bought it is because it is solid titanium and won't irritate his metal allergy, but when I opened it I found that the clasp was stainless steel, which can cause problems. Nevertheless, he hasn't had a problem with it, but some other people might.I also agree with the people who say that the watch could use something to help visibility in the dark. They're right. The face is almost impossible to read in the dark even though it does look very handsome in the daytime.It is also loud. He never takes it off, but I can still hear it, particularly at night. Still, it looks gorgeous on him and will look good on anyone with a warmer skin tone. It's a lovely gunmetal grey."
2,Ignore the 5 stars - believe the negative comments,"I was pretty psyched when I got this last year because it looked amazing and the ticking didn't seem as bad as other people said. It really does look amazing and I've worn it every day and with suits.But then when I was traveling it randomly broke. I've never smacked this thing ridiculously hard and one day I looked at it and there was a big crack across the crystal. This propagated and got worse until it was almost completely unreadable. Plus, about halfway through its life the ticking got really noticeable. Sometimes loud enough to bug me when I was trying to sleep. Especially bad if you put it on hard surfaces in certain ways.Now, having owned it and see it broken, I have to agree with the others - looks great but unless you're set on it, avoid."
1,Do Not Buy,"I purchased this watch for a reasonable price, and it was shipped just as stated. However, the watch itself is of poor quality. It looks really nice and has a great feel to it. Very light, however the quality suffers because of this. The glass in the face of this watch is too thin and shatters easily. If you do not wear it outside the home you will probably be fine. I tried contacting the company for a replacement or refund on the item and they told me that the damage could not be fixed or replaced. I do not recommend this product for anyone who wears watches often."
4,Product Guarantee,"I bought this watch for my husband for Christmas and the crystal was broken when he unwrapped it. I had it fixed at my jewelers for the amount of $37.89. Will I be reimbursed for my expense? I have my receipt. Please send instructions.Thank you, Paula RamboAmazon Account #4640188010363159"
3,"Nice watch, only one complaint.","The watch is very nice and looks sharp. The only issues is with it's ticker. This watch has one of the loudest second hands I have every heard. I could even hear it while at the theater watching a movie with my wife. Other than that, I love it."
3,Nice inexpensive watch with loud tick,"This is a very nice lightweight and thin watch that looks more expensive than it is. You will definitely not notice it being on your arm, but you'll probably get many compliments. However, the second hand is loud enough to be quite annoying. In a loud environment, this is not a problem, but if you are in a relatively quiet room you will definitely hear this watch tick (even from a distance). I am a musician, and could hear the watch tick every time I stopped playing, so I ended up returning the watch for this reason."
1,Far Too Fragile,"This was a beautiful watch and very comfortable to wear, however, I recieved this watch as a Christmas gift and before New Years Eve the crystal had cracked. This was not due to any mistreatment on my part, it simply broke. I would recomend avoiding this watch."
3,It's an ok watch,"it's light, stylish.But boy, it is LOUD. I listen to Mike and Mike in the morning when I drive to work, but I could still hear the watch ticking when I drive.I have yet had any problem with the crystal that other users are talking about.As long as you don't mind the ticking noise, it's not a bad watch to have."
5,Excellent watch,I recieved this watch as a gift. It actually replaced a previous model Skagen titanium watch that I wore everyday for 3 years. I very much like the understated clean design this watch has. It would look good whether you were wearing a suit or wearing jeans and a tee shirt. The mesh band is comfortable and the clasp is very secure. I've banged it around a couple of times with no visible damage. I have been very pleased with this watch.
2,Broken crystal,I bought this watch for my husband as a birthday present he liked the sleek very thin design. After 2 DAYS!! Of owning the watch while sitting on the couch we heard a pop and the middle of the crystal cracked and popped out literally flying 2 feet in the air! He hadn't even moved. It reminded me of what happens when you place say a hot glass in cold water it will crack. the funny thing is that the crystal is like 1 inch and the very center of the crystal literally popped out leaving a hole and the remaining crystal still in the watch just an empty donut like hole. I know he didn't drop it or anything and he has an office job so it didn't get smacked around. Very disappointed and Dillard's would not return or exchange it so it is good to know that Skagen will replace it!
4,This is a great watch for a minimalist,"This watch is great if you all you need is a watch. It is super light and comfortable to wear. The one problem I have with the watch is that it is uncomfortably loud. I can hear it across the room while the TV is on. Think Edgar Allen Poe. My other small issue is the size of the second hand. Maybe it is me, but when the minute and second hand are the same size, a quick glance does not always work. I have to wait to see which one moves so I know which is which. Overall though I am incredibly happy with this watch. It is sleek and stylish, good for any occasion. I purchased a $300 Invicta for nice occasions, but because of the huge weight difference, I tend not to wear it anymore. I would give this watch a 4.5 if I could."
4,"Some problems, but great customer service","I bought this watch about a year ago. Pretty much all the previous reviews you may have read are true. First off, it's a beautiful and light watch, that goes with pretty much everything. Yes, the ticking is quite loud, but only if the backing is not muffled. While on your wrist, it's fine. I actually sleep with this on now, because it's so light, so it doesn't bother me.The watch has broken on me twice now. The first time, the glass cracked overnight, while I was sleeping. The second time, the second hand fell off. Both times, I sent it in to Skagen, and they repaired it/replaced it and sent mine back stright away, good as new. So yeah, while the thing breaks occasionally, the customer service and the limited lifetime warrenty makes up for it."
2,"Nice looking watch, but a bit noisy","Having owned a Skagen before, I bought this one. Nice look, color, etc., but caution: this watch is a bit loud. You could hear it ticking even if about 8-10 feet away -- could be a minor annoyance at night time."
3,Skagen Men's Titanium Watch #170LTTM,"Looks good and easy adjustable band. The time is hard to read with the titanium dial since it acts like a mirror (a white dial might be better??), date numbers are small and the crystal is thin. The crystal broke after 3 days but Skagen replaced the watch with no questions-says something about their image."
5,Takes a lickin' and looks & works like new,This is my second Skagen watch. I love the low profile and the fact I can wear it when I work on my car or in my woodshop without concern. Having shattered the face on my SS Skagen I bought this one so as not to be w/o a Skagen while my first was being repaired.
3,Skagen's watchbands have only a short lifetime,"I was given a Skagen watch as a gift a number of years ago. I liked the styling and was very happy with the watch. However the mesh band at one point got bumped and from that day on it unraveled into a spikey, painful nightmare of mesh wire. I took it back to the retailer and they replaced the watch (it was still under warranty). They no longer had the same watch so I chose a band that was linked instead of mesh. Again, after just a couple years, this band has now broken at a very fragile linkage point around the clasp and they no longer honor the warranty or supply watch bands. The Skagen web site does not list band replacements and I can't find any watch repair shops that stock them. I have not gone the route of sending the watch to Skagen yet, so the ending may yet turn out fine. In the meantime I feel I have a product that is forcing me to jump through some major hoops to get the simplest of replacements taken care of."
2,Skagen Man's watch,These watches are prone to cracked crystals. I liked everything about the watch until the crystal cracked and the cost to repair exceeded the cost to replace the watch. After purchasing 2 with the same result I am now wearing my 7 year old TIMEX with no problems. Check the internet reviews before you buy or wear only for dress.
3,"Looks good at first glance, but too many truncated songs...","The problem with this 2-disc set is that many of the best songs are cut short in order to pack the album with as many different tracks as possible. Short edits of some of James Brown's best material does not do the man or his musical legacy proper justice. Maybe some people don't mind having 2-3 minutes cut out of these classic songs, but to me, and anyone else that has any serious appreciation for this music, it simply won't do. A much better buy is the 1996 2-disc compilation ""JB40: 40th Anniversary Collection"" which has all the really essential hits in their full uncut glory. Or if 2 discs is a bit more than you had in mind, try 1991's ""20 All-Time Greatest Hits!"" as a more basic alternative."
5,A True American Hero!!!,"I bought this set directly after a live James Brown concert with the Soul Generals and Bittersweet here in Seoul, South Korea on 24 Feb 2006. Absolutely fantastic! What an amazing performer! My good fortune was that this CD set also came with the Soul Survivor DVD the James Brown Story (although slightly different from yours): ""In this 90 minute film, James Brown tells his own extraordinary life story for the first time. From his childhood to his early raw Soul music, then from funk to hip-hop, the Soul Survivor has become a musical icon. James Brown leads us through his controversial life on this new landmark DVD, featuring his greatest musical performances, live and on archive!"" (Quoted from the cover). I should have bought two sets at that time. Too bad it's not offered here. I also got a free poster with the purchase. Mr. Brown helped to change the face of society and will forever be an American hero."
1,This filter for the 2004 trx450r,Really overpriced does fit stock u have to trim some stuff to make it fit then on top of that it barely adds anypower i would recomend going stock everytime shitty product waste of money
3,Nice and Easy,This is a good little book about Auschwitz. It is extremely thin and easy to read (128 pages). If you just want to know a little bit about Auschwitz and are not inclined to read one of the heavy books on the subject then this may be a good alternative. I found it easy to read and did not lack any of the intensity found in the bigger volumes on the subject. It is very detailed. It is also a great book to introduce yourself on the operations of the death camps. This book may spark your interest and you may want to read further on the subject. I finished it in only a few hours. Nice and easy reading.
4,The terrible scope of the horror,"Most of the previous accounts of Auschwitz that I've read have been personal accounts, most recently Rudolph Vrba's Escape from Auschwitz. While these personal accounts are quite powerful and serve to put a human face on a tragedy of almost inconceivable scope, they are only slivers of the big picture. This book provides a broad overview of the history of Auschwitz, compiled from eyewitness accounts, transcripts of war crimes trials, and the memoirs of Rudolf Hoess and other Nazi's involved in the camp. While it lacks the emotional impact of a more personal account, this book helps shed some light on the scope of the horrors of Auschwitz and Birkeneau and the holocaust in general. By itself, it is an important overview, but if read together with the stories of individual survivors, it provides context for understanding the personal accounts."
5,Brief but very impactful,"Of all the literature I have read on Auschwitz, this may have been the shortest, but it was the broadest in terms of disclosing the roots, history and back story of how Auschwitz came into existence. Additionally, the author paints a painfully detailed recount of life and death for those who found themselves behind the barbed wire death camp. The images the author conjures are haunting and horribly vivid, but it's an important part of history that will soon have no living survivors to testify as to the horror they experienced. May such atrocities and evil deeds never again befall on mankind. Truly, this essay sticks with you and should be considered required reading, not only for those who are dedicated to learning about the Holocaust, but by all. Written testimonies are the one thing that lives on after the survivors are gone to ensure that future generations will never be swayed as to the legitimacy of these kind of infamous events in history."
5,Easy Read. Very Informative.,I had to read this book for a US History class and I was very impressed by the book. At no time was I bored with the book. It's actually very captivating and informative. If you really want a short book that is full of information and does not get boring read this book.
2,Pretty bad,The music is a bit cheesy.The video quality is pretty bad.The framing/movement made my wife sick.Don't buy.
5,Insight to the ascetic mind,"I stumbled on this book and bought it because of the title, never imagining that it would be so entertaining, full of the intrigue of spiritual inquiry gone slightly haywire. It is a series of short stories dealing with the oddities surrounding various young people bent on finding enlightenment but who also find peculiar twists and turns in their quest. Not always complimentary to the messianic guru types, either.Read it!"
4,Helpful and Informative,"If you have been waiting for the right book to help you understand periods of history; you don't need to wait any longer! Allen F. Davis and Harold D. Woodman have edited the perfect compilation of essays for any one to garnish their knowledge of American History.The essays begin from the era of Reconstruction and end with essays that debating about what conflicts exist within society in the 90s. Each essay is by prominent historians who write about their specialized field.It is very interesting and rewarding to read. The sections encourage critical reading because they are structured in eras with 2 or 3 essays that often provide conflicting viewpoints. This makes the reader actively assimilate what is being discussed.The essays are not overly pretentious in intellectual nature, however, it does require a previous knowledge of the historical events surrounding the topics of the essays."
2,disappointment,"I had Ken Ishii's previous album, Sleeping Madness, and it's one of my prized possessions. I was really excited when I first bought this CD but I was sorely disappointed when I finished listening to it. The only tracks that were worth listening to were ""Iceblink"" and ""Drums in Friction,"" but I thought they were just barely above average.There really wasn't as much originality as compared to the previous album (considering I have Kitaro CDs and other similar dance tracks), but then again Sleeping Madness tracks are a little hard to beat since there were so many collaborations and that upbeat progressive trancy feel. This CD had a much more downbeat to it."
1,NICE CHAIN BUT NOT 4 FEET - ONLY 3 FEET 3 INCHES,"While this is a sturdy chain lock, it is NOT as described as a 4 foot chain as stated in the listing. UPC 72774 39210 on the lock packagingTHIS CHAIN IS ONLY 3 FEET 3 INCHES LONG, which will not work for my son's bike. Bike World has been notified of this this several times but has yet to change the listing or notify Amazon.NOTE: IF YOU NEED A 4 FOOT LOCK, DO NOT BUY THIS CHAIN. IT IS 9 INCHES SHORTER THAN LISTED!"
2,Not for Me,"Do not care for this commentary. Too wordy, too much like seminary book, notwhat I was looking for."
4,Product Enterprises Supercar,"Many of us Supercar fans who aren't skilled enough to build a resin and metal model waited for years for a good pre-built replica of the fantastic Supercar and had to settle for the Remco battery-operated toy. This one fills the order nicely! You can almost hear the engines charging and Mike Mercury calling out the RPMs. As good as it is, though, there are a couple authenticity points it misses: There are no side windows! How do they expect us to travel under the sea like that!?! The second thing I notice is that the Supercar logos on the sides of the nose are too small! There may be other problems with this model but I haven't noticed (even I'm not THAT picky!) All-in-all, this is certainly worth the price. As a matter of fact, I'd say it's ""Satisfactory....Most satisfactory""!"
3,"Not bad, but not great.",The book was an easy read and was ok at best. It was not real detailed and only covered the basics. I would have liked to see some more depth in the chapters... I would say it was average.
3,Not enough sources,There was some good info in the book but not enough sources for training facilities..There must be schools somewhere in this huge country.
2,Not a corelle,"I ordered this as filler to reach $25. Though, its name looked like this is a 'Corelle' piece. This is not. Very ordinary."
5,One of the smartest collections I have seen,"Once I read the forward and first bio, I knew this was going to be the new short story textbook for the literature and writing classes I teach. Not only are the stories carefully and thoughtfully selected, but the order and importance of each is highlighted and informed by the introduction from other accomplished writers. I have used many short story collections in my classes, and this is by far the best and most thorough anthology I have seen. Beyond that, my students love it (no small thing)!"
2,"Short Fiction, thankfully","This book is filled with stories on how life sucks, how relationships fail, and how no one should be trusted. Then you die.Thankfully, I bought it used and hopefully able to sell it back once my class is over."
3,Foreign Film,Movie has English subtitle. The plot is different from Disney's version. Has sad ending.
3,"Mixed feelings: Loved music, hated video.","Well, I should start by saying that my review is definitely biased! (I'm a Baroque fanatic)I really like the music. I'm glad I bought the dvd just to watch the performers and hear the composers which are pretty good (some are new to me).Now, the reason I didn't like the dvd is because the way it was directed. I was really hoping to see the performers play in real time, just like going to a concert, but this was heaviy edited and the stylistcally directed. There's nothing wrong with that, it's just that I didn't like it. You could tell the performance was recorded in a nice place and all you see is the musicians pretending to play the same thing in front of the camera (very much like a music video). I just wished to see the real performances.I'm glad I got it, but...!"
2,Visually dreadful,"I have been a fan of Il Giardino Armonico for quite some time and was excited to find this DVD listed, particularly since it contains music not often available elsewhere.I was TOTALLY turned off by the visual aspects of this DVD; in fact, I found it much more enjoyable to close my eyes and just listen to the music. In at least one selection there is approximately one camera change per beat! It is a DVD that I can take in only small doses."
3,Black Blinds Show Dust,"If I had to do it over again, I would not order black blinds. I dusted then very well as soon as I hung them, but the very next morning, they looked almost as dusty again. It would cost more than they're worth to ship them back and exchange them for alabaster, so I'll keep them for a while. They aren't the best quality, but they'll do. If you want really good quality blinds, these wouldn't be the ones. The shipping was lighting fast, but they weren't packed in a protective box. The label was slapped on the thin cardboard box the blinds came in, so it was lucky they arrived unbroken."
3,2 of the 3 broken,"not sure if it was from fedex, or if they were broken to begin with, but 2 of the three were broken beyond repair....they looked nice, felt sturdy, but were broken...... huge dissapointment"
4,Good Product,"great product for the price. Only complaint I have about is that it tends to get dusty fairly quick. But then again, it could be because I live in an apartment with furry animals. Other than that, no big complaints"
5,"Unique insight for all ""Road Warriors!""","Worth the price of admission for ""mystery lights,"" and ""wrong film."" You'll have to read it to know what I refer to!Gary's book is chock full of useful information, with an inside view from a corporate photographer's perspective.Definately a must-have!"
1,JUNK!!!,These tubes have an extremely high failure rate. On one 50-mile ride I went through FIVE of these tubes in a matter of hours. The quality of Bell products in general has gone to hell and I will never again buy anything made by them.
5,LOvely,One of many watches that I have but this one is easy to wear. Looks good at any time of the day. Catch is good.
1,very pretty watch,"the skagen watch is very attractive. only problem i have with it is that every so often the watch falls off. it is supposed to snap into place and sometimes it appears to be in place, but isn't and falls off. i fear that at some time i will just lose it."
4,Gift for my friend,This is a very nice gift for my girlfriend. The price is very good and the quality is perfect.Will definitely recommend it to anyone who needs an everyday watch.
1,Very unhappy,"The watch was OK, but the clasp was not as described on Amazon, so I did not want it. Sent the watch back in accordance with sellers specs, AND NEVER RECEIVED A REFUND. Seller does not respond to phone calls.VERY UNHAPPY!!!!!"
1,stopped working after 2 months...,"I dont know if it was just a flaw with my particular watch, but after just over a month of owning the watch i started noticing it was slow and progressively got worse over the next month - now if i set it 5 minutes ahead of the right time, in four days it will be hours behind. It also says its waterproof up to 30m, but Ive only washed my hands with it on and barely got it wet, so I dont know why it is not working. Just looking at it now, im realizing it has been at the same time for the past day... very dissapointed."
2,too big/long for a small wrist,"I will admit that I did not even try to look for any instructions as to how to shorten the band to fit my wrist. But even if I had shortened it, the face of the watch was bigger than I expected. Just too big/long for my small wrist. I returned it."
1,I cant rate what I havent received yet as it was lost,"No item has been received and Amazon are still strying to track the order. When and If i receive it id be happy to provide a review, but to date I give the service 0 stars."
1,"Pretty, but loses time","I had the same problem as another reviewer where after 2 months the watch started getting slow by several minutes a day. I replaced the battery, didn't help. Sent it to the manufacturer for repairs, and they sent it back claiming to have fixed it, but the problem persisted. And I was out the shipping & handling costs. It is nice-looking, but not a good timepiece."
2,"Nice watch, bad clasp",The what overall is pretty nice. Skagen is a good quality watch. the problem with this one is the clasp. It's difficult for a peron to use the clasp and it doesnt always lock when you think it's snapped in. This clasp is very inferior and causes the watch to fall off sometimes. Not very happy with the overall quality.
2,"Wouldn't order this again, should have paid attention to other reviewers!","This is a handsome watch. However it came loose in the package and I had to work to make it look appropriate to present as a gift. The catch on the strap does not stay fastened, something which leads to easy loss of the watch. I don't have time to send it back and get something else for Christmas, but after Christmas I will send it back and get something else for my wife. I am sorry I didn't pay attention to others who had commented about the strap. I figured that they would have seen those comments and fixed the problem, but sadly, they hadn't."
3,so. so...,"It is not luxury, but simple .diamond (?) s are very small than I expected.everyday I use it"
3,Great watch if it stays on!,"The watch is pretty, sleek and my wife received compliments already after only having it a few weeks. The problem is something mentioned by other buyers...the clasp is terrible. It's loose, poorly executed and this thing comes loose constantly. If she loses it I...and she (!) will be two very unhappy campers! We can't rate a watch well when she can't wear it comfortably because she's always stressed this thing will fall off. Therefore it gets 3 stars and all of them for looks. Fix the clasp, Skagen, it's not a good watch until that is done!"
4,Great value and looks good,"Have always loved Movado designs and when I lost my watch a few weeks ago was very tempted to indulge. However, the more I looked online, the chunkier the Movado bands seemed to be. My boyfriend had a very elegant Skagen a few years ago and I began to look at Skagen. Finally settled on this one and am delighted. The design is elegant and clean. I too have a small wrist but was able to move the clasp fairly easily."
5,Nice looking and functional,"I bought this because it had all the items on my wish list (second hand, not too big, silver, adjustable band). It looks great on, keeps decent time, and I love that it fits my 5 1/2"" wrist with no excess band hanging out. (The unused band tucks under and stays put.) Other reviews mentioned a problem with falling off. That only happened once. I think that was because I hadn't fastened it securely. Now I make sure to listen for 2 distinct clicks when I put it on, and I don't have any problems.I liked this so much that I bought it for a birthday gift. And at the price, I think it's a very good value."
4,Pleased Overall,"I've had this watch for about two years, and I'm happy with it. I wear this watch to work on most days, and sometimes on the weekend. It looks nice with casual and business-casual work clothes. It's very comfortable to wear, as it's not heavy and the band is flexible. The band also doesn't catch in my arm hairs, like some other metal-banded watched. Unlike others' complaints, mine keeps time well and I've never had the clasp pop open.I gave it 4 stars for two reasons: 1. The metal area around the watch face picked up light scratches pretty quickly, and 2. today I bumped my wrist against something, and it snagged the band and ripped some of the mesh. It looks like this is a difficult part to find a replacement for, unlike many other watch straps, so I'll have to send it through Skagen's repair center to be fixed."
4,Buying another one,"Just ordered my second one of these. My first only lasted about 3.5 years - a little disappointing, compared to my older Skagen model's 6 years - but I'm pretty rough on watches, so maybe it's me. Anyway, I love the look, it's super comfortable, and you can't find anything nearly as nice for the price, so I'm trying again.I *will* second what others have said about ""water resistance"" - Skagens are fine for everyday use, but don't immerse them."
3,Lost a crystal 10 months into owning this,"I am pleased with the fit and the style but was disappointed that the crystal in the 9 fell out after less than a year of ownership. Since that isn't a moving part, it isn't covered by any warranty. The local jeweler fixed it for $10 but I still feel a repair this early in my ownership is unwarranted, especially since I treat the watch carefully. I wear it only at work (in an office) and remove it as soon as I get home so that means I haven't gardened, cooked, showered or anything else while wearing this watch."
4,Very Satisfied,I bought this for almost 50% less than it sells in the local department store and am happy with my purchase. The only trouble I have had is with the clasp. It is a little tricky and you have to make sure that is catches correctly. I found my watch on the floor recently because the clasp came open.
2,"Pretty, but doesn't work well. Skagen didn't repair well either.","While this watch is very nice looking and I love the design, it doesn't work so well. The small hand in mine doesn't keep up and always looks an hour behind. I had it repaired once after only owning it for 9 months. EVEN UNDER WARRANTY, Skagen charged me $13 to repair it plus shipping cost. After less than a year, it's broken again and I went to the website and they want $34 to repair a watch. Plus I have to pay to ship it to them. The watch costs less than $100 so at this point, I'll just toss the thing. Too bad they concentrate mnore on design than function."
3,Do the math,"The items in this combo cost significantly less when purchased separately, and there is free or cheaper shipping available as well."
3,Upper Peninsula Lake Superior Rock Picking Beaches,This book is similar to Sparky's Rock Pickers Guide to the Lake Superior's North Shore. Its focus is on good rock picking beaches along the lakeshore in the Upper Peninsula. It also includes rock and stone descriptions that are not found in Sparky's book as well as another set of descriptions for many of the rocks that are common to both areas.
1,"It's not big, and it's not clever.","This book, shockingly aimed primarily at children, tells the horrific story of a group of Nottingham Forest supporters, known as the ""Smash-Up gang"" - a powerful, subversive offshoot of the ""Tricky Trees"". Through bloody, and often stomach churning prose, Seymour describes their rampage through the centre of local rivals Derby's city centre, and with almost child-like glee revels in the telling of wanton violence and destruction. As a concerned parent, and Derby County fan, I am appalled that this kind of material be so easily and readily available for young children to read. I had to stop reading the chapter devoted to the Smash-Up breaking into the Fat Cat Cafe Bar beer cellar and urinating into the Speckled Hen as it was too distressing to carry on. Awful. Avoid, like a yellow pint."
4,"Excellent content, but could use some editing","First the cons: this book is beautifully printed, but the editing could definitely use some work. It has several typographic errors that should have been caught. The writing is also occasionally stilted, and it could be a little more organized.That said, this is an excellent book, especially for potters and students who are interested in using local materials in their glazes but don't really know where to begin. It is thorough, and provides not only the basics (ie., how to do line-blends), but also information on calculating a material's specific gravity, Seger/unity formulas, building your own ball mill, and more.A recommended read for potters and students wanting to know more about glazes."
4,"Good book, but not practical at all","I live in Florida (sand all over) and it's really hard to find anything but sand here. But if we ever move, I would tried to follow some of the orientations on this book."
1,Very Disappointed,"This was actually the 2nd time I tried to purchase this hat. The 1st time, the logo on the front was completely off-centered. The 2nd time it looked okay, but the snaps on the sides didn't work. I tried to exchange the hat but I was told that it was discontinued...I guess Reebok finally gave up!"
1,fuzzy pictures,"I have to say right up front this camera takes fuzzy pictures! we cannot figure out why! If we eliminate using the zoom that reduces the fuzzy pictures but we still get 2 or 3 in the roll. I recently took a picture of my daughter smiling for the first time and was so excited about gettting the film developed. Of course, there were 2 pictures fuzzy and one was the pic of my daughter smiling. I was mortified. I do not recommend this camera at all and am shopping for a new one. I did look up on the internet and not often but i did find another person with the same problem. I would have taken the camera back but it did not start this problem until 4 or 5 months into use!"
1,Don't believe the description,"I bought this camera on line relying on the description which stated that the battery was included. I had some events which I wanted to take pictures of immediately and felt that having the battery included would allow me to take immediate pictures, and also felt that not having to buy a new battery (or two) would increase the value of this purchase. When I received the camera it did not have a battery, I did report it to the customer service but its been two weeks with no satisfaction. It seems like a good camera, but I'm returning it as &quot;missing a part.&quot;"
2,Used book,"SURPRISE!! The book I ordered ends up to be a used book from a library with a last page torn, first page annotated! I didn't expect that from Amazon."
5,A must read....could not put it down!,"Infallible had all the elements; stimulating story, entertaining characters with a story line that takes you around the world. I literally could not put this book down. Infallible had humor, mystery, and intrige- reminds me of ""Tales of the City"" by Armistead Maupin."
5,"What I wanted, when I wanted it.",The seller sent the item in excellent condition and it arrived when it was promised. I would certainly buy another product from this seller.
1,Not what I expected,"I have always enjoyed Erma Bombeck, but what I got was not what I expected. I thought I was getting a humorous book, but only got a kindle picture book of one liners. I read the whole book in about 5 minutes! It is not worth the price, save the money and get one of her other books that shows her talent with humor."
1,not good at all,i paid almost 8.00 for this book and it wasent a book at all it was just some pictures with little words of wisdom with each picture . what a rip off save your money on this one
2,Short-lived,"I have the exact humidifier pictured, but re-branded as 'Kenmore'. It was quieter than other warm-mist humidifiers we had in the past, and we were quite pleased with it at first. After about a year, the auto shutoff float got stuck in the middle of the night, and the unit started smoking until we pulled the plug. This was not a cheap unit, and the wicks are not cheap either... It cost far to much to die so quickly. I would not buy it again."
4,Good product and evens you out.,this brand does take a while but it helps your stomach become better day to day and you become more regular.
4,Good,"The first week taking these, I took about 2 a day. I was bloated that whole week and very gassy, I realized that it was probably because my body was not used to the proper amount of bacteria. After a week not only did these problems go away but my candida problem went away as well A++."
1,Noticed nothing by using this product,"I've had thrush/candida overgrowth for THREE YEARS now thanks to a course of antibiotics I took back in 2009. I've tried everything to get rid of it, to no avail. My doctor told me to try this stuff...I did, and noticed absolutely no change or benefits of any kind."
1,No effect,"DID NOT WORK FOR ME AT ALL, after completing the entire bottleNo noticeable bad side effects or anything, but nothing good either.Here are 2 studies, one saying Natrol is junk, the other saying it isn't too bad.(1) Table 2 of this study says with confidence level 100% that there is effectively nothing in these pills:[...](2) Natrol isn't too bad:[...]"
3,Slow and Predictable,"As soon as a character says ""I'll tell you the big secret in the morning"", you know they're doomed. It's a silly plot contrivance. The book was OK but that level of plotting isn't worth more than 3 stars."
5,Weber's translations are powerful,"Carl Weber's traslations of Muller's works are incredibly powerful, this collection of plays is a must for any Drama Student interested in modernism, surrelism or history. Muller's works are amazing and in depth studies of present history and well worth the read (and the challenge involved in staging them)."
4,on with the show!,"Ann Estelle's class is putting on a play. Ann Estelle hopes that she can play the part of the queen. She thinks she perfect for the part, she already has a crown and a robe. The teacher tells her that she will play the part of the stage manager. At first she doesn't like the job because she doesn't think it's important. As the show goes on she play a very important role. The queen has gone on stage with out her sword that she must use to fight the dragon. Ann Estelle thinks fast and runs on stage as a servant to give the queen her sword. She has saved the play!What did you like or not like about the book?This book has a great message for kids. The message is that there are no small parts. Everyone is important and must work together as a team.Would you recommend this book? Why or Why not?This book would be great as a storty time book. The illustrations are very cute and will appeal to boys and girls of all ages."
5,"Thank you, Thank you!","Here we have 2006, a fabulous crew, a receptive audience,what more could you ask for? Sonny and the entire crew really cooks. I count my lucky stars that an artist of Sonny's caliber is still with us and can be this great.I usually grumble about electric basses, but in this blazin' performance, it fits like a glove. Jazz is alive!"
4,Sonny Rollins Live in Vienne,"I will be brief and short regarding the review of this DVD.To those who are searching for a great image quality this is definetly a great DVD to have because of the crisp image and sound quality. It lacks some content due to only a few songs, but the performance is woth watching for those who enjoy Sonny's improvisation skills."
5,"Great shoe, very comfortable!","I purchased the black patent leather shoes (with the swirl heel) and love them. I have heard great things about Jessica's shoe line so my expectations were high. They are very comfortable, sterdy and stable, and they absolutely look great! I would recommend using a thin padded insert to keep your foot from slipping (the lining of the shoe is the metallic material). I will be purchasing more from Amazon soon!"
3,Pretty Shoes but quite uncomfortable for me!!!,"I loved these shoes at first sight cos they looked pretty and comfortable (besides,i love high heels), i read some customer's review and was more encouraged to buy them. They were delivered to me yesterday and i decided to wear them to the office today, had to pull them off cos my big toes were killing!!! felt like my nails were about pulling off....not getting the comfort i expected. Still like the shoes though.Mogi"
3,Nice shoe,"I tried these on barefoot and really liked them but with panty hose on, my toes killed me immediately."
4,One of my favorite heels to wear !!!,I've been looking at the BONE shoe for quite some time and finally bought it. It does take in a few trips around the house to break them in but this is probably my favorite heel I've ever owned. I actually planned my Christmas outfit AROUND the shoe. I would definitely by more of these as they are quite comfortable (remember the trips around the house first) and very stylish. Your feet & legs will look amazing !!!
5,Nick of Time,"I first watched Nick of Time on cable about 5 years ago. I was so into this movie. It is like a good book...you just cannot put down until you have finished reading it. I had to have this for my own collection. It is truly a fantastic movie. It will keep you on the edge of your seat. Just when you think Gene Watson (Johnny Depp) has finally found help from the officials he thought he could trust, lo and behold he learns everyone he approaches is involved in this dirty political event. Christopher Walken and Johnny Depp together are awesome. These two actors delivered a powerful, intense, riveting suspense that will have you wandering who will survive. Movie lovers...do not hesitate to purchase this DVD.You will not regret it. You will want to watch it over and over again."
2,Missing scenes,"The DVD is missing some of the scenes that are in the TV version. There are no deleted scenes either. Where did the scenes go and why? I expected the DVD to have more, not less than the TV version."
2,real time plot made me wish movie was really over,"I got the movie because I think most movie try to neatly tie up things that happen over years time in 90-120 minutes. This movie was even worse. I did check my clock to see if really was real time but more often I found myself watching to see how close it was to being over. Christopher Walken is here, looking his usual emaciated self, as if they don't pay him between movies and all he exists on is water. He carries the movie, not Depp. Depp had help along the way but I kept wondering why these people would want to help him. Most people, if they see you on the side of the road with a flat tire won't help you. They won't even call for help on their cellphone. So why would they help someone who might get killed? I did kind of like the bathroom scene. That was the only suspense, but the filmakers threw in a fantasy scene that took away from the action. The female villian was entertaining as a reluctant babysitter. Try it. You might like it"
1,no thrill,"This movie has an unrealistic story that was not helped by the mediocre acting. I should have been warned by the enthusiastic review on the box - only from some unknown radio station's critic. It was not utterly boring, but I was not thrilled for a second. It was so much ""film-like"". Want to see a real thriller? Try 'Seven', 'Jacob's ladder', or even 'The game'."
3,4 stars for acting 2 for the plot,the plot is weak ate best and the story feels like it is going nowhere at times but depp and walken are amazing and it is almoast worth viewing just for them I said almoast
2,This movie saved Johnny Depp's career,"Thankfully, this movie seemed to scare Depp back into doing the characters he was created for. :) He makes do with what little he's given here, and Christopher Walken puts in his always tremendous performance as the off-the-edge bad guy. Unfortunately, despite the gimicky real-time plot line, there's just so little to work with for both of them.There's little suspense because the outcome is never really in doubt, and the plot stretches are HUGE. The political commentary was transparent and heavy handed. My friend and I had a bet going as to whether the lead character was actually going to be named ""Nick."" I was a bit surprised to find that I had won and that Depp's character was named ""Gene."" The rest of the movie is so formulaic that I wouldn't have put it past them.Completist Depp or Walken fans will want to see this, but don't go into it expecting too much."
3,Hold your child's hand at the transit station!,"Good addition for my Depp collection. Not the greatest movie ever, but it did showcase Depp's subtle style and Walken's knack for playing the pathological character. Depp's performance resonated, Walken's style entertained me on the spot, and Dutton portrayed his character as a great foil to Walken's. There are some humorous parts, i.e. the rollerblading scene. I was distracted by the little girl. (I am a mother, and little girls do not just sit in the car that long and behave that well.) The moral of the story: Hold your child's hand at the transit station! And in general, if you see Christopher Walken, RUN the other way!!"
4,another Depp classic,"Depp really knows how to pick his movies. his career is astounding and hes one of my favorite actors. this one has Christopher Walken(hes always so evil), kidnapped Depp's daughter so Depp can kill the big kahuna or else Walken kills his daughter at a certain time. edge off your seat suspense with such scenes as when Depp dreams he kills Walken and then Walken throws him off the balcony, one highlight. a must see for any Depp lovers and another one of his best works I might add."
3,It's a balancing act,"As a couple of previous reviewers have noted, there's a little too much heavy-handed pro-liberal push in this movie, and there are many things in the plot that you simply have to take on faith. On the other hand, the real-time plot device is interesting (though the director appears to be a little too proud of it) and the setting, as someone who's lived in California, is plausible. One objection I have to repeat though I've said it once is that the yay-leftism bias is implausible -- bear in mind that California, despite its leftist image in the rest of the nation, has had only three Democratic governors in the entire twentieth century: Pat Brown, Jerry Brown, and Gray Davis. The people of California do tend to pull to the right more than Hollywood gives them credit for."
3,love at first site,"depp : definetly a different character for him. he was good but the plot was just missing something. suspenseful but as I said the plot missed something. good cast, good story."
2,You will want to see how it ends,"NICK OF TIME's story flaws will distract you. But you will nontheless want to see how this thriller ends.That's because director John Badham keeps the energy level high. NICK OF TIME delivers a lot of excitement.Several reviewers have been right to compliment NICK OF TIME co-star Christopher Walken. Walken has been there supporting and upstaging come-and-gone stars (Sean Penn in AT CLOSE RANGE, Matthew Broderick in BILOXI BLUES) before. In NICK OF TIME he's second-bill to Johnny Depp. Ten years from now, let's see if Depp's still starring in many films; I know Walken will.NICK OF TIME also features strong performances from Marsha Mason and Charles Dutton. With Mason, Dutton, Walken and the action-packed talents of director Badham, NICK OF TIME will hold your interest to the end."
4,"Underrated, pre-24 ""real time"" nail biter","Johnny Depp stars in this pre-24 Hitchcockian nail biter as an average joe drawn into a murder plot after his daughter is snatched from him. Pre-dating the ""real time"" gimmick made famous by Fox's hit series 24, Nick of Time utilizes this technique very well for the most part, even though there is danger of the film coming apart before it reaches it's climax. Despite that, Nick of Time is a potent nail biter, with a great performance from Depp as an everyman in over his head, and a superb performance from the always excellent Christopher Walken as a man who seemingly has his eye on Depp every second. A box office disappointment in 1995, Nick of Time is definitely worth seeing for fans of Depp or fans of ""real time"" thrillers like 24."
5,A movie to keep you interested all the time,This is a film you want to watch if you enjoy watching a movie with a good balance between suspense and action
1,Worst movie either actor ever made,I got this because it was cheap and love both the actors. It was absolutely horrible in every way describable. Not worth it.
1,nick of time,Bogus dvd. Will not play in any dvd player sold in USA. Must be foreign made and for different format.
2,Weird all the way around,"This movie started out kind of slow then all at once it seemed to get very suspenseful and interesting in a very weird/evil kind of way. The plot kept my attention but was also a little strange for some reason, especially how it started and ended. Nonetheless, if you like suspenseful political thrillers then think you could enjoy it.Peter J. Miller"
2,Political Propaganda,"This is a formula action flick. It rips off other action flicks, most notably 'Diehard'. The movie is entertaining, though. However it's ridiculous and obvious election-year propagandizing ruin it's weak plot and undermine much of it's enjoyablilty. The director should have spent less time pushing his personal politics and more on the movies' plot. The 'liberals good!', 'conservatives bad' kindergarten propagandizing are insulting and demeaning. Too bad the director feels compelled to treat the audience as idiots."
3,could of used a little work but still good,this movie was better than i expected it to be.the plot is about a man played by {depp} who must kill the governor or these two other people will kill his little girl.walkin who is one of the killers in this movie does a great villian role. the only reason i gave this movie three stars instead of four was because it was a little short for my tastes but this is still a very watchable film.
1,A bomb with eye candy,"* You would think with stars like Christopher Walken and Johnny Depp that the movie might be fairly good, but not only was it the hokiest conspiracy theory to end all conspiracy theory movies, but it took low blows as to pull on tear jerker heartstrings by putting a cute little girl in mortal peril. The only minor redeeming quality to this movie is Depp's hotness, but then again that can only distract you for so long."
1,This is not the classic Snow Queen story.,I was very disappointed in this production of the Snow Queen. Considering the time it was produced I can see why all religious elements were deleted from the tale. However these are major features of the story as Andersen wrote it and are essential to the very core of its significance and symbolism. The additions made to the story did little to make up for its loss of deeper meaning. I found them rather silly. I would not recommend this DVD to anyone who has read and loved the original Snow Queen in all its simple elegance. Dale Sjogren
3,Got a small self esteem boost,"i don't know whether it was a placebo effect or if it worked, but I had a little small stride in my step again. It definitely had some effects when talking to women, I was more confident which is what women want. Not sure if it was worth the price, but I may try it again."
5,Kaguyahime: The Moon Princess,"Fiona Lumis (Kaguyahime) is an amazing dancer. I was mesmerized! If she has a fan club, I want to join!"
1,bad dvd,"couldn't watch the dvd, tried it in several different players, but the picture just rolled the whole time, returned item, only to get another with the same problem, hope this can be fixed before too many people order the set and find the same problem, could be a bad printing of the entire box set. Would really like to see the dvd though,hope they can straighten it out"
2,Hollywood Pig exploitation man !,"Very lame . Mr Jones trying to capitalize on ""what he don't know what it is "" don't expect much"
2,NOT built to last,"When I first installed this burner, it worked great, but after about 10 months, it has deteriorated in quality to the point where it is almost dead. It burns coasters about 75% of the time, and when it does work, it usually burns at about 12x max. Of course the warranty ended right when the problems started occurring, and tech support was absolutely awful. Stay away from this unit unless you don't mind buying a new one every year."
5,Format of book makes choosing a project easy,"What I liked about this book is that your child can choose a science project by looking at the ""Problem"" (or the question) in the book. If the question seems interesting, they are motivated to perform the necessary experiments to find the answer. I also liked the display tips in the beginning."
5,Plug and Play,"I just bought my iPod for the windows and needed to upgrade my PC to USB 2.0. I went looking around for a USB 2.0/Firewire card and noticed that the ones that were listed on amazon have terrible reviews. Many of the issues were with configuration and many were just terrible products. I really needed to get the card quick because my iPod was just sitting there doing nothing, so I decided to thrown caution to the wind and try it out. I blocked out severals hours of my day thinking that it would be a nasty process. However, I plugged it in and it just worked! No configuration issues or anything. I'm writting this review as I'm downloading my music to my iPod. Still don't know about long term issues with it but I'm happy with the configuration!"
4,Entertaining and Thoroughly Enjoyable,"The Mummy gets updated in this adventurous special-effects-driven collection. This is an eye-candy in sets, special effects, stars like Brandon Fraser and Rachel Wiesz. Fast-paced action, smart alecky dialogue, and a sense of humor makes this collection fun to watch. Other recommendations: Harry Potter, Indiana Jones, and Spider-Man."
3,Good old fashioned fun.,"In the best tradition of ancient black and white horror films with half an eye on family holiday markets, I'm pretty sure the films were released during bank holidays at the Cinemas? school holidays too, bored kids driving Mum daft...you get my drift.Geared I guess, towards today's more tolerant and perhaps more blood thirsty children, boys would love all the Mummy splatting and girls will enjoy the lead females being athletic and ready for a fight (come to think of it so would a lot of older boys!)Kind of old fashioned fun, difficult not enjoy it but I am loathed to say these films would be harmless for children because the violence, even if fictional, is still pretty nasty."
4,Because More Movies Need Librarian Heroines,"And that is the biggest reason to buy this movie! :)The main reason this is one of my favorite movies is that my fiance and I ARE Rick and Evelyn. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that I'm stingy with stars-- it's not like this is the greatest movie ever made or anything. It's just a WHOLE LOT OF FUN, and the only chance most moviegoers get to see how tough librarians can be!"
4,Good buying price,I bought this for my husband- I'm not into the Mummy so much however he loved- playing scenes over and over again.
4,Horror and Comedy,"These 2 movies are good together. The second movie is even better than the first which is unusual. We have watched them as a family many times now, well worth the cost."
4,Fun for Kids,"Spongebob continues to entertain kids of all ages in this holiday book. Someday the kids will be too big for Spongebob, but I'll still put this book out every Christmas anyway."
1,Teeny tiny font,I purchased this book for my fire. The font was so small I couldn't read the story to my kids. When I tried to adjust the font it would not allow me to . Disappointed.
4,Could be longer,"I loved it . I always have loved spongebob ,but this was a little bit of a dissapointment. I really think it could have been longer . But other than that I loved it."
3,Not bad,Wish it was a little more colorful but other then that it just ok!!! Wish is was a read a long.
4,Cute story,My 7 year old really enjoyed reading about spongebob bringing Christmas to bikini bottom. Cute book to add to the Christmas list.
4,Small,Good book.pictures too small. Wish it took up the whole screen. Why do I hAve to make my review so many words long?
1,Quite DISAPPOINTED!,"I had great difficulty getting the CD to function adequately, and when I called the Tech Support # provided in booklet, they refused assistance because I had not purchased product directly from them. I am quite dissatisfied with this product"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"My DVD Player died after 4 months.It used to play everything. But one day suddenly it stopped playing and gave a message ""Wrong Disc"".I faced the problem with remote functions.It always interfered with my Harman Kardon remote. When I operated my Harman Kardon remote, it used to behave funny.Very unreliable.I tried contacting customer support. But the email bounced back."
2,not what they say it is,"I wasn't very impressed with this product however very impressed with Amazon.com. They are some excellent vendors and I'll do more business with them in the future. They were excellent.in terms of this product I was not very satisfied with it and should've gotten the Toshiba which was only a few $ more. I have used Toshiba for many years but never owned a Go Video product before.What made me get this one was the cost and the ability to read DVD+R media, which is doesn't read I must add. I purchased some DVD+R media not knowing that most machines only read DVD-R.I would pass if I could've knowing what I know now.but Amazon is AWESOME"
1,Watch out for the warranty,"The unit itself was hard to set up for progressive scan, as it didn't output the menu on the progressive scan outputs until you used the menu to configure it to use progressive scan.My main problem is with GoVideo's support. My unit had trouble reading store-bought DVDs after 7 months. There was no response to an on-line service request after 8 days. When I called (after waiting on the phone for 40 minutes) I learned that it would cost more than the purchase price of the unit to repair, since the ""labor"" part of the ""parts and labor"" warranty had run out. That means the warranty is effectively worthless after 90 days."
5,Great sampler of Northumberland pipes.,The Northumberland pipes are unique. The recording gives a solid overview of these relativly unknown variety of bagpipes. Some of the tunes on the CD are familiar to fans of the GHB (Great Highland Bagpipe) while others are strictly Northumberland. The unique bubbly sound is created by lifting only one finger at a time off the chanter. I really liked this CD.
2,Beautiful photographs but poor quality,"This tells a history of the U.S. during the late 1700's and early 1800's with an emphasis on events and people that influenced architecture and interior design.The photographs are excellent, however I question the accuracy of the text. A couple paragraphs disagree with known experts without any comment. Some sections repeat themselves word for word. Entire paragraphs are printed twice, which calls into question the writing and editing of the work.Finally, before I had even finished reading the book, it had fallen apart in my hands. So regrettably, what could have been a beautiful volume to display is now a bunch of loose leaves."
4,Not a Bad Book,"I was looking for a book that showed lots of different Federalist implementations. This book does pretty good, a lot of outside. I would have liked more kitchens from the era."
4,classic america: the federal style and beyond,Given as gift; friend is enjoying this book very much. Highly recommends it to people who want decorate in the federal style.
2,Penny Nichols,I expected better of Penny usually her stories are better. It was still worth the price but its not one I will read over and over like some of the others.
4,I really like the step by step practical approach.,There are many sections in the book that can be used individually. This makes it very practical for the modern day fast paced single person.I did not put the book down until I had read it to the end. I believe this book is also very useful to very young singles. My college aged daughter can really benefit from it and as soon as it is out in paperback I will mail her a copy.
4,"Good, but not perfect","I've had this bag for about a month now, it does a good job of protecting the camera and equipment, but there are a couple of minor annoyances. First, the carry handle - it is attached to the zippered lid and pulls on the zipper when carrying. A double handle attached to both sides would be better. Second, the plastic snaps - they are a pain to attach/detach compared to velcro - especially the interior strap that holds the camera in place. Third, the bottom - the sides are like armor plated compared to the bottom, which sags when even a light camera is inside. They should put some of that plastic armor thats on either end on the bottom, too."
3,Annoying mostly,"I bought this bag for my Panasonic AG-DVX100B. If fits fine. It has enough padding. Shoulder strap and carrying handle are good. My dislikes are that it does not have enough separate zippered compartments. Only one on the side. The big inside pouch for the camera has little velcro walls that are moveable, which is not as good as zippered compartments for tapes, batteries, etc. Decent bag, but it wastes a lot of space."
4,Good Quality Buy!,"Well I just got this bag for my Panasonic ag-dvx100b and it works great! I will say straight away however I have only had this for a few days, but from what I've seen, it works amazingly. The bag's corners are very rigid to protect it from even moderate hits and the material the outside walls are made of seem very durable. The inside is a nice yellow padding felt like fabric with three dividers. two horizontal shorter ones, and a long one that runs the whole length of the bag. The strap is large and very comfortable, spreading the weight of a possibly heavy camera. All in all this bag looks like it will protect your equipment from certain degrees of pain. It is no metal case, so don't sit on it or toss it, yet for what you pay it will give you a very nice sense of security with easy access and comfort."
5,Excellent,A perfect fit for my Sony EX1 plus accessories. Well constructed. Love the ability to add a wheeled cart too!Highly recommend!
3,"Interesting...in spots, corny in others","When the book sticks to the content of the Bible's Song of Solomon, it's fairly good. When the author tries to take certain passages and make them into sweeping dating advice...well that's certainly different territory.Some of this writer's (a pastor) knowledge about the background of the Song of Solomon makes for interesting reading. But a substantial portion of the book falls into the category of ""personal opinion"" or ""personal conviction"" that's communicated as if it's clearly supported by the biblical text. It's not."
5,The Very Best Resource Available Today for Dating & Marriage,"Having attended the Song of Solomon series Tommy taught at Metro Bible Study in Dallas, I was thrilled to see this powerful study available in book form. I wish this teaching had been available to me when I was a teenager and young adult. My choices would have been different, and I would have been saved from deep pain and much grief. See what God has to say on the subjects of love, dating, marriage, and sex in classic Tommy Nelson style: an easy read, straight to the point, laced with humor, and from the heart. Don't miss this book. Read it and pass it on to those you love (young, old, married, single, divorced). You'll be glad you did."
2,Daneille (non celiac that cooks for 3 celiacs),I ordered the ener g brand because that is the brand of bread we had a Disney and the kids (and one adult celiac) were very excited about everything they had there. These brownies do not measure up to the bread that ener g makes. I've never met a brownie I didn't like but I couldn't eat it (even with ice cream). The clear sign was when I had to throw some away. They will eat them if they are desperate for something gluten free. Anyone who has been dealing with gluten free products probably already knows to freeze the items until you get ready to use them. They mold quickly.
3,Elizabeth Cady Stanton,"This book is about Elizabeth Cady Stanton a women who stood up for women's rights in the early 1900s, in Seneca Falls, New York. She was tired of women being treated as property so she started a women's rights group called the National American Women's Suffrage Association. To me this book is ok. Sometimes Kathryn Cullen-DuPont skips from one subject to another and drags in a couple of areas. I would recommend this book to someone who is getting information for a book report or likes informational books. You will find out that Elizabeth Cady Stanton is very interesting!- Georgia Leva"
3,the children just don't enjoy watching it,"I don't know exactly what to write since I haven't watched this with them. All I know is that they are not at all engaged by this movie. The Backyardigans ""Super Secret Super Spy"" is the bees knees for them and they can watch that show for all of 6 hours during long cross country car trips. But they can't even make it through once of this DVD for some reason. I don't know. Since we watch these movies for road trips, I'm not in the back to watch it with them and I have really no idea what the difference is.Further edit: i should say that my children have a tendency to either completely love an episode or be utterly bored by it. They are bored by every episode on this DVD, whereas there will usually be 1 or 2 that they absolutely love."
1,Don't be misled...,"It is obvious after reading this book that the author has not even heard Farrakhan speak or at least did not listen with an open mind.I doubt that the author has even been to the mosque to hear any of the ministers.If you have an opinion on the Nation of Islam, it is better to hear a speech first hand or talk directly to a member. Save your money by not buying this book."
4,This is truly making it plain!,"I compliment the author for capturing the ethos and culture of the Nation Of Islam. To those people outside of the Nation of Islam, this discourse can provide good content and insight for the uninitiated, into the ultimate motivation in the founding of the NOI, and what place the Nation must have in all Black Liberation strategies, both, today and in the next few centuries."
5,New Educational Wave,"This book is a little unconventional, especially for the typical English literature major who writes dozens of traditional papers every semester. The ideas are fascinating, though. Teachers should consider this book if they wish to allow their students to express their ideas in a format that feels more natural. I have not had the opportunity to teach multi-genre papers yet, but I am currently experimenting with writing one now. If any of this fits your interest, this book is a must-have."
3,What I felt,"Cons :1. need flat vessels and need induction specific vessels2. Plate will be hot after cooking , because it takes heat from the vessel.3. If some thing falls on it, it is going to stuck on the plate similar to noninduction stoves. Though it will not burn to black. Simple wiping with paper will not clean it.Pros:Cooking is fast for small amounts. Morning tea can be prepared in seconds. On big vessels I did not see much time difference. May be because of its power.No startup time. Good range of heat settings.Looked little bulky."
1,$40 exercise in futility,"No mention is made of the VERY LOUD fan noise this unit makes. I paid nearly $20 in shipping when I ordered the unit, and then was tagged for a 15% re-stock fee (another $20) when I returned it to this vendor.Very bad choice on my part.I remain very positive and supportive of induction cooking in general. Since this futile purchase, I have had a Sears induction cooktop installed in my kitchen. It is FANTASTIC!This unit is not representative of a good induction cooking experience."
1,Melodramatic and morbid,"I really did not like this book. I thought it was dry and morbid and it did not seem like there was not much imagination, thought, or effort put into it. It was the first Steinbeck book I have ever read, and it definitely did not make me eager to read any more. Upon being forced to, I found that they were mostly similar. How can anyone consider Steinbeck or his books classic literature?"
2,I am 15 and i read this book,I really thought that this book was very controversial. It established the segragation in the times and i thought that lennie and george had a great relationship and I admire him for sticking by Lennie
2,Glamour Gurlz,"I love Joanna Schlip. She is an amazing make up artist, but this book is not for anyone who is looking for dramatic make up looks. All are very light looks, like for young girls that are just starting out with make up. So yes for the teenage beginner that wants to look very natural with almost no make up. I picked this because I saw Joanna in a make up dvd and her work in that wa amazing! Joanna please do more videos or books with more info and dramtic looks."
1,NOT worth the BIG money for REFURBISHED,"For $200 I would think it would last a bit longer than 34 months. I thought that by going REFURBISHED, I would save myself alittle money while checking out the company and their products. BIG MISTAKE. The brush head died.In the mean time, I picked up a BISSELL lift-off upright from Costco for $150 (BRAND NEW) to try while trying to figure out what to do with the Oxygen (maybe get repaired). I used the Oxygen on thursday before it died and used the BISSELL 3 days later on SUNDAY. I picked up 8 cups FULL of dirt, dust, and junk with this NEW vacuum AND I don't even own any pets!!!!!! This made me wonder what the Oxygen was doing for the past 34 months??? I am NOT going to be wasting any more money on this piece of garbage!!!!"
3,"Superb, but the zippers always bite me","These Bib overalls are amazing - warm, durable, well-designed. Plenty of pockets. Side zippers that pull from the top or the bottom. Chest zipper also from the top or bottom.BUT, they are industrial strength zippers. The are incredibly sharp. Any time I have to dig my wallet out of my pants pocket, the side zipper scratches me up. Just brushing the side zipper while walking has left me bleeding on more than one occasion.But I still love these things - I just try to be aware of where my hands are in relation to the zippers.I would give them 5 stars, but since they made me bleed repeatedly at work ( a no-no in the food industry! Blood is a biohazard ) I cut them to 3 stars."
1,Buyer Beware,"Buyer Beware! I waited 2 months for this and it's not the same book represented in the picture. The book I received is entitled ""Extreme Muscle Cars: The Factory Lightweight Legacy"" and the cover shows a 60's Plymouth dubbed ""Honkin' Hemi"". It's mostly ""lightweight"" drag cars. I never would have purchased this version of the book had it been represented on Amazon."
5,Extreme Muscle Cars,I bought this for my husband who is aso a drag racer. We both enjoyed it. Very nice. Thank you
2,Extreme Mistakes,"Extreme has become an overused word. These cars were not the norm, but they were available from certain dealers. Agreed; no forewords in the book. What really bothers me is the numerous grammatical errors and misspellings. Here's an example: 'the block was bored to .30'. I'm sure it means 0.030 over, but bothersome to me. This makes me suspect the other ""facts and figures"" in the text. Obviously the proof reader was absent that day. They even misspelled one driver's name when the proper spelling is very clearly seen on the car door in the picture. I expect better. I do give it good marks for the pictures; many, clear and interesting. Money better spent elsewhere.Update 1-12-08:Factory Lightweights is a much better book, it's available right here at Amazon and is the better value within the same category of cars/ interest. You can tell more research and author excitement went into this publication. I recommend it over this particular book."
3,ALL ABOARD,Been waiting for this for many years. It was just as I remembered it. Good English humor that carries over to most anyone with a sense of humor. If you have taken a cruise before many of the same happenings still exist today. C6
5,The BEST Exchange Book I've Seen,"As an administrator preparing for the MCSE, I need not only to learn Exchange Server in theory, but also to use it in everyday practice. I am studying with James Chellis' well-regarded ""MCSE: Exchange Server 5.5 Study Guide"" (ISBN 0782127266). However, I have consistently turned first to Mitch Tulloch's book, which is both clearly written and organized logically for practical administration. Tulloch provides plentiful illustrations of his points (in case you're reading without being at an Exchange Admin console) and has many references to further resources, from Microsoft white papers to third-party Exchange resource websites. Simple but not simplistic, ""Administering Exchange Server"" is an excellent book both for study and as an administrator's practical reference."
3,"Informative, but not entirely adequate","Not a bad book.. to the contrary, Administering Exchange Server is a very informative book.. for the typical user with a typical Exchange setup. However, we purchased the book due to problems we were having (and continue to have)with a dial-up (DRAS)connection. The book says a lot about how things DO work and how things SHOULD work, but doesn't go into near enough detail when it comes to troubleshooting those setups that don't work when they should. I was hoping for an all-inclusive technical manual which would help me resolve those problematic issues for which TechNet was of little use."
2,Difficult to use,"This book has some fair information, but it is very hard to find what is needed by using the table of contents & the index. Its is also very generalized information, it did not help at all with just about every problem I have had with Exchange. I am giving two stars only because it has come in handy (very rarely), otherwise I would only give it a one star rating. I am still looking for the ultimate Exchange 5.5 book!"
2,Don't believe the hype,"I got this book because of all of the lowing reccomendations that I saw for it. It has NO troubleshooting, and the information on the IMS is also very weak. Every time that I ahve had a serious Exchange issue that needed to be addressed, this book fell far short of what I needed. I have had to do everything through either online research, or reading an exam cram book. Don't do it."
2,Stick with I Love Lucy,Ball and Vance strain for laughs and have to deal with mostly sub-standard material here. Things that worked on I Love Lucy don't necessarily work on this show.
2,Hawkwind - 'Cosmic Overdrive' 3-CD (NMC),"Only consider purchasing this 3-CD release IF you don't already have the three(repeatedly reissued)Hawkwind CD's,'Space Ritual,Vol.2'(which is on disc one),'In The Beginning'(on disc two)or 'Bring Me The Head of Yuri Gagarin'(which happens to be on disc three).There!I've respectfully reviewed this 3-CD title with no smart-ass remarks."
4,"Attractive, sturdy but needs better wall anchors","Nice looking wall cabinet that you put together. Directions aren't good so if you're not handy you might want another cabinet. It's made of a wood product with a thin laminate finish; water will ruin it. The hardware included is fine except for the wall hangers which were designed for a small picture. Go to the hardware store and buy two hollow wall anchors to mount the cabinet to the wall.Pros: attractive, nice size, clean design.Cons: cheap wood-like material, inadequate wall anchors."
2,Dreadful transfer of a British Classic...,"*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE FEBRUARY 2011 UK ""BLU RAY"" REISSUE ***I not sure 'what' exactly has been 'digitally remastered' on this BLU RAY reissue (as the cover loudly proclaims), but it sure ain't the print.There are scratches on the negative, lines in some scenes, blurriness in others and a general slapdash feel to the whole thing. If this has been supposedly restored, then I can't see where...If you're a lover of the film, then I'd say hire the BLU RAY 'before' you buy to avoid disappointment..."
5,Attenborough classic,Attenborough is truly scary in this story. Unemotional thug who abhors feelings of any kind. Carol Marsh is absolutely outstanding as the naive waitress.
3,"Worth watching, but only occasionally riveting","Periodic strong segments and some good performances still don't bring this film as a whole above a mid-level production. Worth watching, but only occasionally riveting. Very interesting to see the young Richard Attenborough as the gangster Pinkie Brown. I think Johnny Depp might have modeled some of his performances at least partly on this Pinkie Brown."
3,not bad,"i remember nightfire for PC being more fun, but this game's easily miles ahead of ""everything or nothing"" and ""agent under fire."" the graphics are far superior, there's stealth mode and attacks.. i just got bored of it quickly, because to me the game just felt ""average."" ok so there's a stealth mode.. but if you want stealth, why not play hitman or metal gear solid? the shooting control is pretty good, but i don't like how you have to hit another button to zoom in on the enemy. then there's circles around special spots to shoot the enemy on which is just plain weird. it's an average action/shooting game which is more than i can say for most bond games."
3,IS THIS ANYTHING LIKE METAL GEAR SOLID 3 ?,"I loved MGS3 but i gotta question ""Is 007 From Russia With Love anything like MGS3"" i ask this because MGS3 was inspired by Jame Bond movies,the HALO jump,the theme tune ""Snake Eater"" was Bond-esque,some weapons and gadgets,Espionage and so on but i am wondering if this 007 FRWL is anything like Snake Eater in terms of story,EVA from MGS3 is like a Bond Girl,your command team are very Informal like the command team in James Bond films and games.But ""From Russia With Love"" the movie inspired MGS3 the most:the `60`s setting and things like that.Can any of you people do me a favor and write a review and respond if you have played both games PLEASE??i don`t care if you spoil anything jusr write down any similarities between 007 FRWL and MGS3(Not things like you can shoot a gun,somethin like that please sommit reasonable)I also hated 007 ""Agent Under Fire"" i liked ""007 GoldenEye"" though so will i still like it?"
3,"Fun, but EXTREMELY easy","This game is fun, but I beat it very quickly. I hardly ever finish a game, and I beat this in a day. Even on the hardest difficulty setting, you will whiz through these painfully easy levels, which you are led through, they require NO thinking! Overall, this is a game that should only be rented."
3,Fun if you don't think too hard,"So first off, I've read this book a couple times now so you know I enjoy it. It's a fun book too read with lots of silliness. Having said that, I have to be in just the right mood to read it and I can't be interested in thinking too hard. This is one of those books that feels like they put in all the silliness at the expense of things actually making sense. I've seen it in a bunch of books by this author. It's the sort of stuff like the hero gets caught in his zipper and they had to unzip to get him out, but he was taking off his pants at the time - only an unzip should have happened already. As long as you can just read and enjoy without trying to fit all the pieces together, it's a great read. If it's going to annoy you when things don't quite add up, better to skip it."
5,Fast Shipping.,"This book is for my son. Now as the economy is harder and we are still in a recession, I like to challenge the publishers to become more creative to help both parents and students afford school by working directly with the parents/Amazon to privide us a financial break."
2,Written at a basic level,"While the book did a good job introducing basic economic principles, the writing was reminiscent of a young adult fiction novel. The mystery is intriguing, but is overshadowed by the simple writing style. This would be a perfect book for freshman in High School, but if you're looking for a serious novel with an economic aspect, you'll be disappointed."
4,"Great mystery, good economics","This is a good mystery with a very creative plot. In addition, the characters are intriguing and fun to read about. There are great subtle touches, such as the way one hotel guest examines his bacon. (Yes, I know that sounds strange, but if you read the book you will understand)It was the authors first effort, and being such it is not quite as good as the following two books, which I would rate at 4 1/2 and 5 stars. Still, it is a very good read."
3,"It is a good book, a bit slow paced but quite interesting.","Henry Spearman,an Economics professor at Harvard university,is on a holiday at St. John.His holiday is spoiled by a murder of an army general at the hotel at which he is staying. The professor,who tends to explain everything with economic theories, is determined to find the murderer-using economic theories of course. A change of events occur,and a person drowns.Two days later a judge is murdered. The local police associate these activities with black racialist groups. They even arrest two suspects. But as it is they turn out to be wrong. the prof. finds out otherwise. This book is a slow-paced mystery and you might find it interesting so take a look."
4,Great mystery that demonstrates economics,"This is a fun and short read for any mystery lover, and as an added bonus, it demonstrates economic principles in action! Great for students of economics as a supplement to a textbook"
4,Interesting Narrative,"As the last of the all-male colleges went co-ed in the 1970s, the first cohorts of female students struggled to find their place on these campuses. Gina Barreca provides a thoughtful first-person account of the early years of co-education at Dartmouth. Her honesty and candor are refreshing, and her perspective is valuable today, as some of these institutions still do not present fully equal opportunities outside the classroom to female students."
4,Liked it very much,"Liked this author very much, the book was entertaining and interesting. Her style was quite amusing. WIsh she would have written more books!"
4,"Works, I miss the old one though...","After 29 years, my original workbowl broke a tab on the base. In order to repair/replace it, I had to purchase the entire bowl assembly (which was redesigned a while ago.) Not much choice on this, but it seems flimsy compared to the original bowl. And lots more moving parts-I have to treat it with kid gloves now! At least I can still use all my blades--and that DLC-7 motor is bulletproof!I realize I have been spoiled with the original bowl, top, and pusher--I just hope this new version lasts. One good thing? If a single part breaks, I can just buy that part from now on--at least 'til the next redesign..."
2,Not 4 me,I like it mixed with the barbecue but only just a little bit. I like Cajun seasoning at 5 guys and hoped it would be close it was not.
5,Mix with BBQ on Kettle Corn!,"This stuff is pretty spicy! It makes me sneeze too, but it's great if you mix it with BBQ seasoning on some kettle corn! The sweet, salty, spicy, tangy goodness is amazing!It's great all by itself too, but you'll need a few tissues when your nose starts running."
2,don't think much of it......,"don't think much of it kind of Hot I love Cajun stuff, not this can't taste much but the over powering Hot flavor."
5,"Fascinating, insightful.","Unlike many of the other reviewers of this book, I wasted no time looking for alleged flaws in this book. As someone who grew up with and was indelibly influenced by Laura's books, I really appreciated no end the look at the woman behind the legend, as the apt title suggests. Miller does a fantastic job of showing how he pieced through all the existing evidence, and of drawing logical conclusions. It must have been a significant challenge to have drawn those conclusions, given that all of the subjects are long dead: in other words, Miller has done our work for us, giving the reader an opportunity to have an absorbing look at the real woman and her family. For any admirer of Laura Ingalls Wilder's timeless, priceless chronicles, they will not want to pass up this invaluable, generously insightful study. I thank John Miller for an incredible job well done."
2,who is this book really about?,"This book gave a few new insights into Mrs. Wilders life but not to many. We are told that she was a private person and she must have been because most of the info seems to be from public records. I myself would have liked to have had more insight on how the lives of Pa, Ma and her sisters were in later life instead of so much talk about Lauras daughter Rose. Halfway through the book I felt the story began to center on Rose and her dislike of her mother. If you are looking for a book about Laura Ingalls Wilder I do not know if you will like this, there are better ones out there. When I was done reading the only thing I got out of the book was that Rose Wilder was a depressed woman who disliked her mother."
4,Wish it were a little more personal.,"I found this to be a good book, although I wish the author would have personalized Laura a little more. The ongoing battle between mother and daughter might have been overemphasized, but one comes to learn that this probably worked for both of them. I found a lot of good information, but the statistics were a little much. I found myself reading between the lines and wanted to get back to the meat of the story...Laura.I recommend this book to any Wilder fan, for it does give us a glimpse into the woman she really was. Like anyone else, Laura was only human, faults and all.Meloni CassidyAuthor of Everlasting Journey"
3,Boring,"I am disappointed with this book. It is basically a chronological list of very dry facts that is told in a humorless way. The author also spends too much time giving examples of how Laura's daughter, Rose, appeared to have some deep-seated emotional problems. At one point I thought to myself, ""Is this a biography of Rose or of Laura?"" For someone who spends a lot of time harping on how Laura was able to create such real and vivid characters in her Little House books, he fails to do so in his own. I was not drawn into this book at all."
3,Review of Becoming Laura Ingalls,This would be a very interesting book if I had not already read all the little house series plus the book where she went to Mansfield from DeSmet and the one where she went to visit Rose in San Francisco.This is best read before reading the other books. The books by Laura Ingalls Wilder give more detail than any of the birographys by any other author.
3,A History strong on documentation,"BECOMING LAURA INGALLS WILDER reads like a dissertation. Because it is an academic book, written for the history-buff crowd, it's somewhat dry. There is a great deal of information to be read here, however, and you will feel that you know ""the real Laura Ingalls"" after you read this book.The author is an expert on Laura Ingalls Wilder, and spent a huge amount of time in research for this book. He basically recounts as much as he can of Laura's life, based on written accounts of her, and on her own writings. Much of his book also deals with a dominant person in Laura's life: her daughter Rose. The book also features quite a few photos of Laura and her family.Die-hard fans of Laura should read this book only if they are ready for more than 250 pages of history. It's not a novel, it doesn't contain a lot of color, but it is worth reading if you really want to know every detail about Laura's life."
2,Left wanting more,"This book gives only a few new insights into Laura Ingalls Wilders life. You learn she was a private person and she must have been because most of the information about her life seems to be from records of what organizations she belonged to. I did not like the way that the book seemed to turn into a bio about her daughter Rose Wilder Lane about halfway through. Not only did the author talk more about her than Laura he painted a picture in my opinion of a depressed unhappy woman who did not really care for her mother deep down. I also felt that since most of us ""know"" Lauras' family from the Little House books the author could have given the readers some more detailed information about how their lives turned out. That would have interested me more then hearing about Roses' depressed and seemingly unhappy life."
3,Kate in a balloon,"2 kids and kate in her autumn years flying a balloon with dog etc ...fun but slow moving, sweet moments though........"
4,TEAC 52X CDROM Drive,"This CDROM Drive has an excellent price for it's quality. It is a great product! If I had a company of building computers, I would put this drive in every one. If you are buying a CDROM Drive, this is the one to buy."
1,Useless CD-ROM (Can't Read),"I bought this product last week as an upgrade to a higher speed CD-ROM. Everything looks fine except that this CD-ROM can't read cds. My computer recognizes the hardware, but it doesn't show what puts in this CD-ROM. I asked a computer expert and he analyzed the CD-ROM. He told me a chip was broken inside, making the whole hardware disabled. So disappointing..."
5,Excellent,"A long awaited album from the 2 French producers!I discovered Radar on some compilations (Arabica, Claude Challes's Nirvana Lounge)and the album is now out! 10 excellent tracks, downbeat, ambient, with some world music influences. Don't miss it."
4,What can I say...?,"It was a great book! I would have given it 5 stars based on story alone, but there are some editing problems. Not the author's fault of course, but it can possibly make it a bit harder to read than his other book ""A Taste for Money."" this book really gives you something to think about. While Mars' second book is about a good cop gone bad, this book makes it much harder to judge the cops either way. True, they are taking the law into their own hands, but when the law stops working as it should, is this really bad......?It definitly is a ""must read"" much as I dislike cliche terms. I am not much of a ""true crime"" or mystery fan, but these were wonderful. Captivating, thought provoking. A good story and a question all in one. Everything a really good book should be!"
4,A real page turner.,"I found the beginning a bit erratic until I finally understood that reading it from a police point of view, things dropped into place. After I did, I could not stop turning the pages. Somewhat suspenseful and throughly holding my attention. I had to finish this book. First cop book I've ever read and not the last. Waiting for the next from Mars. The ending was completely adequate and surprising!!"
4,nice shorts,"I purchased 3 of those,size: LARGE.they all fit comfortably don't really like the length should have taken XL preferable.Almost forgot quick drying too."
1,Be careful,"This is a great product, in theory. I have used it several times with no problems. Today I tried to paint something a little higher than I normally do. It was within easy reach, but I was holding the paint buddy by its blue base. The bottle went flying out of the blue base, hit the floor, cracked and sprayed paint all over the place. Very disappointing. Be careful."
5,"Not the one in the pictures, but awesome","The cable I received is like the one shown on the second picture, it's pretty long and it does a well job as expected, recommended."
4,Not much to say here,"Works like a charm! I have no problem with the cable connecting to my computer. You can sync media using Media Go, which can be downloaded from the Playstaion website."
4,USB cable,"Alright this usb cable worked perfectly for me the first 5 months i had it. But now it starts to not work. Like my computer says it dosn't recognize my psp any more. But this is probably cause my battery was low. Overall you should get this if you want to get music, videos or photos on your psp. You can also go on the internet with your psp if you upgrade it on sony .com but you need a USB cable."
1,DO NOT BUY USB CABLE FROM THIS SELLER,This seller states that this USB cable is for the Sony PSP.I am here to tell you dear buyersThis cable is not for the sony PSP these guys are selling people the wrong merchandise.This seller will not respond to your e-mailbecause this seller know that they are wrong for selling people false USB cable that isn't even campatible with the Sony PSP.
1,"Buy ""used"" at your own risk","I purchased this cable used for less than a dollar, though with shipping the amount came to nearly $4.00. I received the cable in a clear, unmarked plastic bag, so I'm unsure of the manufacturer. The cable itself doesn't work at all. It won't charge my PSP or send data, making it completely worthless. I have heard that many ""cheap"" cables cannot handle large data transfers. I recommend buying this product ""new"" if possible, or spending the extra money on a Sony brand cable that is guaranteed to work."
5,doesn't disappoint.,"The God Of War franchise has never disappointed it's fans, and this new addition isn't really an exception, great gameplay, graphics, story tie-in, it's was just an enjoyable game just like the other ones, it would be a good buy to the people who followed up the story line of the saga and it will definitely fill in the blanks so-to-speak about Krato's continuing quest of revenge against the God's of Olympus."
2,Sony PSP USB Cable,"I over-paid for this PSP cable. It is not unique for this device.This is an ordinary digital camera-type USB cable with two different ends - one side is a rectangle to connect to your computer, the other is a smaller semi-hectagon (see the picture). It works fine with the PSP, and other devices like cameras, mp3 players, etc.It is a better value to purchase the Sony Media Manager for $25, which comes with the same type of USB cable, and allows you to transfer music and video to your PSP."
3,My ideas,This isnt really for psp its actually for Nintendo DS.... i got ripped off.... not worth buying unless you want it for DS
5,Very good product here!,"My friend had sold me his PSP but said he had lost his USB cable. I have been looking in stores and said they didn't have any or sold out. I came on Amazon and BAM! I saw a good product at a cheap price and no damage WHATSOEVER! Now I can put my music videos, songs, movies, AND pictures on my PSP. I give this item 5 stars!"
5,A++++++,"Worked great with my psp and pc. To download stuff to your psp using a pc, you need this usb cable! It works great!"
5,best tips for an in-home art studio,"This little book is jam-packed with helpful tips for the non-professional artist/designer. While I'm sure the professional could profit from this guide, I think it is most useful to the aspiring artist/designer who has a design idea or project and needs help in getting from the creative urge to the realistic application. All kinds of how-to with precise illustrations are detailed by the author: how-to organize your desk top, drawing board and materials and supplies, how-to use inexpensive, easily-available materials to make helpful artistic devices, how-to make lettering, free-hand circles and test t-squares and triangles for ""trueness"" and on and on. I work in stained glass and I've found this book of great practical value for designing and for setting up a simple work space at home. I think other hobbyists and crafters would find great value for the money in this book."
1,Yuck!,"I wish I could give this book zero stars! This monstrosity is a sick way of perverting the gospel of Jesus Christ. It not only supports ideas clearly contradictory in scripture, but exploited this foolishness on the sinless perfection of Jesus Christ. Reader beware: This book contains faulty errors and heresies that are demolishing to the good news of Christ."
5,An eye opener,"This is the first book I have read on this subject. The scholarship was impressive and thorough, the style a bit wordy and redundant. I liked the history of the literary, religious, and cultural interpretation of target texts from BCE to the present. I have read these verses many times and not realized the fact of the non-traditional gender roles / departure from social norms that they represent. When Jennings treats the traditional 'gay bashing' verses in the OT and NT, the information is consistent with the other authors i have read. Separating the 'Jesus tradition' from the iconoclastic historical Jesus is a task I recommend to all who claim to understand Biblical teaching for gender roles, family values and the meaning of Christian love. The book is well organized which lends itself to continuing study. A liberating and empowering read."
4,the urge to destroy is a creative urge,"In this novel Acker aims her critique at the gnarly intersection of capitalism, violence, sexual dysfunction, and male dominance. In order to live out this critique, Acker jettisons most of the (male-dominated) traditions of narrative as she writes, systematically disrupting the stability of characters and setting, and rejecting the claim to authorial originality (as you might guess from the title). Some might say that this rejection is a case of throwing the baby out with the bathwater, but I'm more inclined to say it's form following function. Exemplary."
5,Just as I recall,"I originally owned a copy of this book years ago and easily learned and memorized the steps to solve ""the cube"" using the guidance provided. I can't say that I recall my personal best time on solving the puzzle; but the patterns were easy enough to memorize that I could find the solution while talking to friends or walking down the street. Considering all the possible moves, I think that's it's impressive that the book is simple enough to memorize those solutions. My original must have found it's way into a garage sale years ago, so I purchased a recent copy and a new cube. If my brain can still understand it at my age, anybody can use this book to solve this frustrating little puzzle and maybe even actually impress their spouse or, amazingly, their children! I see that other reviews that say there are solutions requiring fewer moves and I have no reason to question that. All I can say is that the solutions provided in this book are easy to understand and that they work!"
3,Solution Book,"This I could of done with out, I think they make it more difficult in the book than what they have on the site. I think I may of used this once, probably would not recommend this."
4,Rubiks Cube,Had a copy of this book years ago and had lost it. Was glad to find it because it has easy solution to learn.
3,...cheap looking...,"The earrings are quite cheap looking, emeralds are completely dull, unlike the internet photo. However, shipping was fast and accurate."
3,Entertaining but implausible,"interesting, entertaining, probably worth reading if you read quickly, but the story line is so implausible as to be a bit annoying."
3,"Enjoyable, but not great.","Parts of this book really didn't work for me. At points Kincade really did seem TSTL and Mel, for someone losing his sight, seemed to see very well when the occasion called for it. Other parts worked very well-very good suspense on the final visit to the island. I also did feel I was missing a bit not having read other books in the series. Overall, I enjoyed it."
4,Great for gun cleaning.,I purchased these swabs for cleaning my handguns. I got sick and tired of Q-tips fraying on edges giving me something else to clean out of my guns. These swabs are perfect for applying gun cleaning solution to hard to reach places.
5,Cotton Applicators,"Excellent. Easy to use for medical reasons such as cleaning wounds, pins, etc. Love the 100 pkg style. Wish they were at stores such as Rite Aide, Longs, Wallgreens to buy.Very handy for hard to reach areas."
1,Didn't get Puritans.,Did not get Puritan swabs. The vendor sent some other brand of swab and the shafts break very easily. Worthless really.
3,Upset,I went to this web site after finding Ultracote on the web advertised at $15.51. Now amazon wants over $20.00 per roll. False advertising.
5,a fascinating trip,"what an amazing film. The acting, the direction the surreal use of editing, it's amazing. You could compare Philip Ridley to David Lynch but both directors have their own individual talents. Ridley has proven to be in complete control over the film, it amazes at every turn. An awesome movie."
3,sharp,"I've enjoyed the movie and its soundtrack. But while getting the video is no problem, no one seems to be able to provide the score. Not even Amazon.com"
3,Well acted but very strange movie.,All the performances were great but I found the movie to be a little disturbing. Brendan was able to show his acting range by playing such a dark character.
3,Passion on Darkly Noon,"It's an interesting movie to say the least. Excellent acting on the part of Brendan Fraser but the storyline wasn't the greatest. Ashley Judd seems to hold her part well, however i think that it would have been more effective if she had brown hair rather than blond. All in all I'd say it's worth watching."
5,the shoe,"The tiny sub-story of the shoe is, to me anyway, what makes this movie really stand out from anything I've seen. And the end credits song performed by PJ Harvey is pretty special too. Thriller + fairytale = goosebumps."
3,Unexpected,"This is one dark movie (no pun intended) I have watched the movie several times and the more you watch it the more you begin to understand the dynamics. Brendan Fraser spends most of the movie as an innocent, bible cult follower, stuttering houseguest of Ashley Judd who nurses him back to health when his cult is attacked. The most interesting thing about this movie is you can tell the EXACT moment his character turns evil. I was amazed at Mr. Fraser's turn-on-a-dime acting ability. The ending does leave you scratching your head, but Mr. Fraser's character and performance is like no other movie he has ever made."
5,savage beauty,"The other reviews offer fair warning. This is a tough film and not for everyone. For some viewers this will be a very good film. For others a waste of time. For me, well worth while.Wild and sometimes incomprehensible beauty runs through the photography, scenery, characters, and story. The beautiful girl has a very dangerous innocent sexuality that can torture men. Fraiser's naive innocence about his own primal passions and ""normal people"" and indeed his own consciousness is utterly tragic and frightening. His pain is both sympthetically touching and disturbingly distancing. The scenery is wonderful, but keeps reminding us of remoteness and isolation. There is lots of beauty in paradox, or contradictions.(Interesting touch that he stutters awkwardly in his new world with the people who have rescued him, but does not stutter in his own internal conversation with his dead parents.)"
3,Definately Dark Passions!!!!,"I have to say, I have seen better Brendan Fraser, but, this was a side to him I had not yet seen. Kuddos to Ashley Judd as well. I specifically enjoyed the psycological progression Darkly walked through. From chuch choir boy to self mutilating monster. But, this movie rang one theme throughout. It was a wonderful illusration on how anyone can do anything given the right circummstances and stressors. And Ashely Judd's character definately was a source of stress for Darkly. Poor soul, never had a chance with her limited wardrobe. I tried using the method Darkly's parents did to name him. If I actually named them the words I came up with, things would be miserable on the school payground with all the teasing. HOpe I didn't go too far. For Fraser fans a definate viewing is recommended. Just to see the scope of his abilities."
4,"Repression, Agrression, Symbolism, Delusion, Obsession","Passion of Darkly Noon is a fine surrealist thriller. It lacks the impact and mystery of Philip Ridley's previous feature The Reflecting Skin, but I still highly recommend it. The tone is murky and off-balance, as it should be, but all the scenes dont work. Though, for every part that feels awkward, there are such scenes as Darkly's punishing himself, his conversation with his parents, and the finale, that more than make up for its flaws. Thrillers with a surreal slant are few and very far between, so if you are intrigued by the films description, most likely, you will find it quite enjoyable.For all you poor Brendan Fraiser fans, that want to see him all cute and likeable, well, this is definitely NOT your movie."
1,"thank you ""Ewwwww""",i totaly agree Ashleys pitts were disgusting!! this movie was stupid and i was about to fall asleep when that nasty arm pitt scene came on and was so frightened and disgusted that i couldent sleep for a week. i wouldent recommend this movie to my worst enemy.(or to any one with a weak stomach or with eyes!)
1,IT MADE ME SICK,THIS IS NOT ONE OF HIS BEST VIDEOS. THERE WERE A LOT OF SCENES THAT MADE ME SICK TO MY STOMACH.
1,"Nominate for"" Worst Movie Ever""","I'm almost ashamed to admit I watched the whole thing.This seems to be the premise: throw together a lot of blood and fire and nipples and explosions and bullet holes and you have a movie. . .Sorry.. . .then, for good measure, throw in a circus elephant. . .Sorrier.I still can't believe I watched the whole thing."
3,"NOT GREAT, BUT WORTH WATCHING","This was a bit of a disappiontment, not nearly as well crafted as Philip Ridley's superb The Reflecting Skin. The plot deals with a recently escaped? cultist, niave, shy, cumbersome, and possibly deadly. He goes from one sheltered enviorment to another when he is nursed and befriended by a couple who live in the middle of a forest almost completely detached from the world. Here he begins an obsession on the woman, and the tangled, misguided story ambles along. Its one of those movies that just didnt come together right. Somewhere, somehow, it lost its vision. Some tinkering with the script here and there, the editing, maybe reshoot some scenes, and, with some needed spark, this could be a great movie. Its not horrible. It has its moments, and the acting by Viggo Mortensen, Ashley Judd, and Brenden Fraser is fine. Somewhere, in the moviemaking process, it just fell down and never got back up."
4,Flannery O'Connor meets Fellini,"This is a very fine little movie that deserves more attention. Granted, it is not for everyone, but neither is FARGO or PULP FICTION. The acting, esp. by the leads, Judd and Fraser, is on-target, and the photography is consistently interesting. But it is in the oddness of the situation, the ""plot,"" that the movie distinguishes itself from just about anything I've seen lately. DARKLY NOON is a strange melding of many ideas and emotions--guilt, repression, religious zealotry, sensuality, violence, love, beauty, grotesqueness--that we all know, to some degree. It most closely resembles SLINGBLADE, though it is not quite in that league. Yet it is symbolically rich and, though unsettling, a breath of fresh air. This movie resists all forumlas, and it is one of the, say, top twenty movies I've seen in the last three years."
4,"well, I like it","I'd have to say that Eliza Carthy and the Kings of Calicutt is good housecleaning music. Listening to this I can usually work up some enthusiasm for mopping. In other words, it's mostly uptempo, with a few good choruses to sing along to rather than attempts at vocal virtuosity. Eliza Carthy has a nice but not BIG voice and even on this where it's largely her singing, sometimes with backing singers, you can hear that she knows harmony singing. That gives it a sort of friendly, informal feel. So it's not a life-changing record, but it's a really good one nonetheless."
1,this is the worst,"oh my god i read this book and i couldnt understand where he was. to me will seemed like a jerk. i also could not follow it , one minit he is in woodshop class the next he is home and then at a bowling ally and then in woodshop class again. never read this book."
1,Very Confusing...,"I picked up this book and even after first page I was like ""What? Who said that? Who replied that? What does this have to do with the story? Huh?"" after twenty more pages I was totally lost. I never even finished it. Why read a book you can't even understand? Some books are boring, but at least you can understand what's going on. I can't even say that much for this book."
2,Style Overload,"The writing grabbed my attention immediately. As the reader, we are listening in on a character who has this voice talking to him...all...of...the...time. Gripping for the first ten pages or so, but excruciating and exhausting before you get even halfway through the story. (A story which is very well hidden behind the incessant talking and questioning of ""the voice."") Did I mention the exhausting part?This is Not a quick read. Were you looking for a quick read, dear reader? Were you? Is that what you need? Things to be quick? Because that what books can be, can't they? Quick. But why call them ""reads,"" anyway? Aren't they really books? Isn't it strange how people call things what they aren't? Can you even ponder that, reader? Is it worth pondering? Why? Why even ask? Does asking . . .(No kidding. That's what the book is like from start to finish.)"
2,Freewill,"My book was Freewill by Chris Lynch. It was about a boy named Will whose parents die in an accident. So Will goes to a special school and lives with his grandparent who aren't very nice. It was kind of a depressing book because there are many teen suicides going on and everyone is blaming them on Will. The book was very confusing and hard to follow. You didn't know who was talking or what exactly they were talking about. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. Even if you could figure out what was going on, it wasn't a very appealing story."
2,Confusing,"This book was perhaps the worst ever written by Chris Lynch. The thinking was muddled and the story seemed almost pointless. The book was written in second person narrative which made it super confusing and if I hadn't known about this beforehand I probably wouldn't have been able to finish the book. And once I finished the book, it was a welcomed relief. I had to fight my way through reading this book. I recommend that you pick up some of Chris Lynch's other works, which prove to be much more enjoyable reads."
2,Classic but difficult and impenetrable treatment of E&M,"Jackson's text is widely considered a classic in the field,but it's not intended for the first-time student ofclassical electromagnetism. Instead, one must approach witha firm physical and mathematical grasp of Maxwell'sequations. Then Jackson becomes an indispensable referenceas it covers almost every significant classical topic,albeit only in a cursory survey. Read Jackson to getadditional insight after you know the stuff; he definitelyhas things to teach you, if you're capable."
1,The Third Edition is Disappointing,Will the fourth edition be clearer? Jackson remains a standard text but not a good one. The only improvement in the third edition is that Jackson has finally conceeded and uses S.I. notation at least for several chapters. More examples would be helpful.
3,Useful Examples,"This book is a little hard to follow, but has many good examples. I was able to learn much from this book and would recommend it in conjunction with another E&M book. I chose to buy the second edition because the entire book is in gaussian units."
2,"Good idea, but...","I was excited to try out this skimmer for my 10g nano reef. It seemed to work fine for a few days, but in less than a week it was both constantly throwing micro bubbles inside my tank and the cup was constantly overflowing. I eventually had the skimmer part as far out of the water as I possibly could, nearly 3 inches above the 'suggested water level' and still the cup would overflow within two hours. Adding extra filter floss helped stop the micro bubbles but also caused mad overflow from the cup. Having had it for a month I have yet to have it do any real skimming and it is now in a box under my tank."
1,Poor quality,"I bought two thermometers and immediately noticed that they were not reading the same temperature. I proceeded to calibrate them with ice water - not that difficult. Not even a full 24 hours later, they were both reading. They also did not come with correct size screws for installation. Basically, this product is an utter waste of money. Do not buy."
4,Item as expected.,"I bought this thermometer to measure the temperature of my garage during the winter. This is a no-frills thermometer, but that is what should be expected for the low price. Item was accurate within 1 degree when compared with my digital thermostat. Viewing angle for reading the temperature is not very wide, but easily readable when view straight on. The mounting screw was missing from my package, but almost any nail or screw will complete the task.In conclusion, this is not a fancy thermometer, but if all you are wanting is a simple thermometer then this item will complete the task."
1,this doesn't work - don't bother with it,"I bought this thermometer recently. It doesn't show above 68 (even when in the 80s) and below 60. Have tried everything and nothing gets it to show correct temperature. Also, difficult to read. 3 times bigger than my little thermometer of >20 years that broke and yet harder to read. Cost more to buy a padded envelope to return it than the cost of the thermometer (it came in an envelope not a box). Also, as per other reviews the screw that come with it to hang it up is too big - after all this time you think they'd fix that problem also. Not worth the money - not worth being given free (in my opinion). It just doesn't work."
5,Timex TX1001 6.5-Inch Tube Thermometer,"thermometer practical use at home and decoration of the room, very good presentation very precise in your value, easy to read"
2,Worthless hanger,I picked this for the price and size but the hanger on the back is too small for the screw provided.
5,"It's a thermometer, what else do you want?","I wanted a thermometer to put outside my window so I could quickly check the weather without having to look it up. This is exactly what I needed. It comes with a single screw to hang up, but I didn't need it."
4,Does its Job,This thermometer does its job well. I bought it for work and it works great so far. I gave it a 4 though since it's simple and I haven't been able to scientifically test its ability.
3,Okay For The Price,"I selected the least expensive thermometer I could find as I wanted only a general idea of temperature in my bedroom...especially in winter as there's no heat in the room.(fortunately ,I'm in SoCal so it's not cold) The thermometer is serving its purpose...and at a very low price."
2,Cheap and hope it works,"Ok, I got the items pretty fast. Opened the package and found the screw came with it is too big and the hole on the back of the thermometer is way too small to match in there. I had to find my own screws to hang them on the way.Cheap product and certainly you got what you pay for. Just hope it will actually work."
1,The screw mount does not work,"There is a supposedly removable tab on the back to then screw to a wall and then mount the thermometer. The tab did not come out on mine and I had to cut it ""jerry rig"" to make the mount work. The thermometer probably works fine, but I recommend going with a different model unless you have your own nails or screws to mount with smaller heads because the one they provide is too big when the tab does not come off like expected and probably designed. I know, that was a run on sentence."
1,Garbage,I bought 3 of these earlier this week. All 3 broke when I tried getting the wall mount plate off.
3,Minor Installation Issue,"The mounting screw included with the thermometer was too large for the hole it was supposed to go through, requiring me to find a screw with a smaller head."
2,"Good deal, but doesn't mount properly","It's nice and cheap. Unfortunately it is unclear how to mount the thing to the wall. There is a hole to put the screw through, but the little plastic mounting bracket refuses to detach from the thermometer, making it impossible to actually screw in."
4,Not bad for the price,"I ordered two of these. They display a one degree F difference between them and are one and two degrees F above my more expensive thermometers. I can't swear to the accuracy of any of them. I picked one to mount over an A/C vent to monitor my A/C efficiency. I put the other on my shop wall. The mounting was easy and quick. You must pry off a little part with a hole in it and screw it to the wall with the enclosed screw. Then fit the thermometer back onto it. For the price, they are a good buy."
5,"Very accurate, inexpensive thermometer","I bought three of these about two years ago. When I opened the box they were all three reading exactly the same temperature, and they have remained accurate since then wherever I have used them - indoors, outdoors, in refrigerators, etc. I've had not-so-good luck accuracy-wise with a lot of other thermometers, but these have been very dependable. I just ordered three more. I would have also ordered one of the 10 inch versions, but it doesn't seem to be available anymore."
5,Accurate,"The Timex thermometer shows the same temperature as my high-priced digital thermometer, even when its not mounted but lying flat on my desk"
2,Not for indoor use,"This thermometer is simple, inexpensive and lightweight. The problem is that the tube is held by two rubber rings and can slide freely if you push it a little bit by accident or if [big] kids play with it.The temperature given by my thermometer is now uncertain by something like 2F or 1C which is not good enough for measuring indoor temperature for most purposes.I would not recommend this item for indoor use. I guess it can be OK as an outdoor thermometer to get an idea of how bad the weather is, or if you own a reliable thermometer that you can use for recalibrating."
5,"Provocative, Brillant and Controversial","Prof Terry Tucker, Senior Doctrine Developer, Saudi Arabian NG Modernization Program;The author presents a balanced, provocative and well presented case for how victory or defeat occurs in battle. This book is designed for both the tecnical numbers kind of person and also the less technical. The chapters can be read as a stand alone or you can also go through the entire book. Either way it has immense value.The thesis of this book is that force employment, or the doctrine and tactics by which forces are used in combat is centrally important. This book is great reading, is controversial in its presentation but clearly provides both empirical and quantitative analysis to support his position. THIS BOOK IS A MUST READ."
4,For Young People,"Many years ago, while a friend & I lived in a ""home"", this book was given to my friend to read and then passed it to me to read. At a young age of 14, and living the life we were living, this book was an inspiration to us both, to let us know that things CAN turn out for the better. This is a good reading book for those of you who think that nothing good will come of your life."
2,a big disappointment,"I was really disappointed when I bought the single of DJ Sammy's Heaven. I expected the remixes to have different sounds which they do, but not in the same way it is in the Candlelight Remix which wasn't on the CD. So the only song I liked on the whole CD was the original radio version of Heaven. I was really disappointed with all the rest, but I love the Heaven and Candlelight remix that are on the album."
2,GREAT CANDLELIGHT REMIX,"Bryan Adams version of Heaven is truly great... But then so is the CandleLight remix of the same track by DJ Sammy & Yanou.. Both offer the same uplifting feel.. however, i would NOT recommend the other dance remixes... as such, save some money and just download the candlelight remix from the net...."
5,Awesome,"Awesome songs. Yanou is a beautiful woman, and her voice is amazing. I reccomend this to everyone."
5,Fully comprehensive but especially of twentieth century,"Iverson has written extensively on American Indians. I suspect he knows the Dine best. In Dine, he provides a history from Dine arrival in the Southwest to current times. Perhaps he has skimmed over prehistory and early history because they have been detailed elsewhere. The 'Long Walk', too, has been often examined, but Iverson adds another dimension to it.He strikes me as not as detailed as LockeThe Book of the Navajoin his accounts of conflict between Spanish and Dine before American arrival, but his late twentieth century analysis of Dine culture change, with their amazing adaptability, adds much to our knowledge.We also owe him a debt for his clear writing which in many cases makes his book read like a novel. We're equally indebted to Monty Roessel for his fine photography illustrating contemporary life.ernestschusky.com"
3,Not my interest,"I bought this book because it was required for a class. It does have some interesting information in it altough it is not something I would purchase again, just because my interests lie in other areas. However, it does provide some good history about the Navajos."
3,This should have been called *RECENT* history of the Dine,"The Dine are an ancient people, and I was looking forward to learning a bit of their long history and culture. I was disappointed to discover that only about 15 of 400 pages cover history prior to the Europeans showing up. And that first chapter on their long history feels incomplete and rushed. The rest of the book gives a quite detailed but dry recounting of their recent history."
4,"Navajo history, at last!","A coherent, cogent and lengthy history of the Navajos was much needed. Well worth purchasing and reading. The average American does not know much about our native peoples unfortunately. I wish all schools would really teach more authentic history so that every citizen can bring to bear pressure on Congress to help all tribes with their needs and problems. We are always giving to other people in far away places, while our own are neglected."
3,Neti Pot for Better Health,"The book came in perfect condition, my only gripe is that the book's too short/ simple...not the dealer's fault: You did excellently! Thank you for selling! :)"
4,"""Let's get into trouble, baby!""","Wittier than most low-budget comedies, this scruffy little gem has all but been forgotten by movie-goers. Too bad, it's entertaining, immensely likeable, and even kind of inspiring, (Cusack's character is brimming with confidence and a warm sense of positivity). Lots of genuinely funny moments, a terrific soundtrack, and great chemistry between the cast members make 'TAPEHEADS' worth a look for those who prefer their comedy offbeat."
3,"Not the best, not the worst","This movie is one of those flicks that might come on late night TV when there's nothing else on. Cusack and Robbins show flashes of their future abilities, but the movie's limited script hold them back. I would recommend this movie to fans of Robbins and Cusack, but not anybody else. It's interesting to see them in this kind of '80s spoof, considering their later body of work. This movie is good to watch once or twice, but it does not hold up to repeated viewing."
2,This was not a good movie. I'm sorry.,"I love John Cusack. I like Tim Robbins. Mike Nesmith and Jello Biafra are just short of deity status. And the soundtrack includes the Dead Kennedys, Fishbone, and They Might Be Giants (the greatest band of all time). This HAD to be a good movie. But it wasn't. It was very pretentious, Cusack's character really wasn't his type, and story was just plain dumb. I laughed at parts (hence the second star) and I wanted to like this movie desperately, but I couldn't. I'm sorry. A lot of people like this movie, enough to raise it to ""cult"" status, but apparently I'm not enlightened enough to get it. My $.02."
5,great fun movie,"my son and I like this movie alot,we have watched it like a dozen times.we love the music.I really think its a great movie,but then again this family pretty much likes all the stuff the critics don't like..I am big John Cusack fan and he is awesome in this.."
4,remember what we did to Jello Biafra,"Two losers decide to persue their destinys after they get fired from their security guard jobs\; they meet chicks, a fried chicken magnate, and the Swankey Modes.Watch for Jello Biafra; as a cop!"
4,Just got it...pleased so far,"I got in at the $160 mark + with a promo cert. of $20 so I thought I was getting a good deal.I am very pleased so far...DVD and CD. I like the option of hooking up other analog ie camcorder...vcr etc. I have not tried these yet.I hooked this unit up to a recently purchased Boomtube (speakers) (Amazon..currently $35...while supplies last) and WOW ...nice.I have a disability so this unit makes it easier to test etc.The inside disc cover is strangely cheap looking but I treat these things with care and it should be ok. The remainder of the unit looks very good and sturdy.8.4"" IMO is just the right size for real portability and viewing...along with the price. Price is quite high with an increase in screen size. Prices however are falling as I write :)"
