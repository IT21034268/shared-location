5,Motivating,Matthew Martinez gives a step by step approach to purchasing income property. He explains the reasons behind his method with formulas so easy to use I placed them on excel.
3,be carefull,This book is idealistic at best and savings emptying at worst. This guy hit the real estate market at the right time under ideal conditions. his main philosophy was to over extend your credit and reap the rewards. With him the market was skyrocketing and bologna loans were everywhere. This book has no merit under less than ideal conditions and quite possibly dangerous to new investors.
4,Great Motivator as well as Step by Step Guide,"Matthew broke this down into a fantastic set of modules that you take on step by step. The trick to real estate is the nuts and bolts. As they say, ""the devil is in the details"" and Matthew has taken care of that. In developing online marketing programs for real estate agents at internetassetgroup.com, I have read my fair share of books and this one is a winner!Way to go Matthew!"
2,"There are many, many better books out there","Hi all,I just returned this book after reading it through twice. This author's description of his rise to real estate wealth is shaky at best. The timeline, as written, does not work. I find the financials he describes highly questionable. Purchasing several appartment buildings using one secured line of credit off a condo? I don't think so.As mentioned in other reviews, this is not a credible system for puchasing investment/revenue real estate, but rather a story about an individual who either got very, very lucky (of which there are many in real estate) or is padding his jacket.There are many, many better books out there. This author is trying cash in with a catchy title and some cheerleading. Nothing of substance. See Keller's new book: same price, much better value."
4,Informative but strategy does not work in today's market,"I agree with many of the reviewers that the strategy from this book does not apply in today's housing market. Extracting equity out of your condo is impossible these days unless you have owned your place since early 2000. Also, the financing world is much more strict after the housing crash, so no more easy leverage. It's possible that the author might have gotten a little lucky with his condo as he bought it right before the boom, and was able to amass more investment capital by the time the housing market peaked. But, I believe that he knew what he was doing and had a high level of the real estate market even before he bought the first condo.Having said that, I found the information on how to manage a property, calculate income & expenses, and determine appropriate property values are quite good for beginners."
5,2 years to a Million By Matthew Martinez,I have various rental properties and found the book to be an excellent source of information. It has great tips for handling situations with tenants.
5,"go ava, go arizona!","What can I say about Ava Fleming? Beautiful, mysterious, physically fit, gracious, fun....I have seen many videos of Ava and have seen her perform up close at Plaza de Anaya in Tempe, az. I always try to pay special attention to the ladies from my home state, Arizona. As usual Ms. Fleming instruction was very good. Easy to follow, though I don't bounce down to my knees. I can't get back up, LOL. I would recommend this dvd to my students and to DVD instructors. Its good to learn at least one new thing a day. Today I choose this dvd."
3,worth a try,some one told me this shampoo was a miracle for their ever tangly hair. I have tangles too.I tried it and just got itchy.. (I am hyper sensitive) and it was not an improvement for my hair.HOWEVERbut it might be a miracle for someone else... and I hope it is!Its cheap and worth trying if you havent found your perfect shampooit came leaking in its package... so some improvement could be made for shipping.
5,Excellent horse novel for 8-14 year old kids. Horsemanship.,Wonderful story of a poor boy that is a son of a baker in Austria. He longs to see the Lippian horses perform their beautiful dressage ballet movements. He teaches his old cart mare to carry herself with pride and gets notice by the Spanish Riding School that trains the Lippizanners. He gets a job there doing exactly what he loves-riding for a living. This book teaches that hard work and passion for your work pays off. It also teaches that dreams can come true. It teaches horsemanship down to the smallest detail. I highly recommend this book. I can not believe that it is out of print-I wanted to carry on the tradition and buy it for my daughter now that we have a horse. Good Reading!
5,The Best Horse Story Ever!,"This is the story of Hans, a young Austrian boy that wishes more than anything to work with the ""Dancing White Horses,"" the Lipizzaner stallions of Vienna. In the story he is accepted to the Spanish Riding School, the finest riding school in the world, and then the work begins. Teamed with his patient instructors, one two-legged and one four-legged, Hans sets out to achieve his dream and prove to everyone that any goal is possible with dedication. This is my all-time favorite horse story; the characters are believeable, the illustrations are gorgeous, and the story is timeless."
5,Must Look...Good Book,"A must for beginner horse lovers! And for mothers who tire of reading second rate horse books to little girls (and big girls; and boys too)!The is a first rate read aloud story for any horse lovers or for anyone who loves a good book. I had forgotten how lovely it was - it is the sort of book where Mum has to pause because she is too choked up to read any further...a story of hope and following dreams, even when life is tough! You learn a lot about the real world of the beautiful Lipizza horses too. You cannot get better than this in the imaginary world of horses and in a child's world of figuring out life!"
3,it was not the one,I ordered the item an i was told it could be used an it would cost me anothe 100 to install !!!
3,2004 Dodge Ram w/ 7speaker Infinity System,The harness comes in 2 parts. The power harness and the speaker harness. Th speaker harness does not fit the on board harness.
1,does't last,We have had a monitor like this for close to 3 years and it hasn't worked correctly for the last year. The screen will get all spotty and do odd things then it will go blank and I can't get to come back on. We couldn't find the warrenty papers so my brother in law took it apart to try and fix it. He contacted the company and they said if he sent it back they would fix it for $20 so he asked for the address and he has never heard back. You can't talk to a human and they won't email him back.
3,Great when it works,"I bought one of these monitors off Amazon about a year ago and it has worked fine. I love the larger pixel pitch for my old eyes. I bought a second unit a couple months ago for use at work, and within one month it stopped working (white screen of death). Evidently this is a fairly common fault with this monitor. Since Hanns G has no local service depot, I had to mail it back to them in Southern California for repair. It is now fixed but a lot of hassle for a monitor that should be more reliable."
2,buzzes with text on screen,"This monitor works fine overall, except for one big problem: when displaying a large amount of text in MS Word, it emits a low but clearly audible buzzing noise. No other monitor I've ever had has done this, and muting the computer doesn't help. So if you do a lot of writing, I would recommend you stay away from this monitor."
4,Good big monitor for the money,"I have one of these at work. Since I am constantly using my computer it is a great monitor for all around general purpose work. It is wonderful to be able to have several applications running and have them all on the same screen at once.However, if you want to watch high res movies or do detailed art work - this is not the monitor for you. The viewing angles are not great. If you are looking at the monitor dead on - you are fine.Again - great for work, not so hot for videos."
4,Good all around monitor for a good price,"If you want a large monitor this is the sweet spot for value. The 24"" isn't much less than this, but the 30"" is much higher. Its a great monitor for watching movies because its able to produce a full 1080P picture. There are some odd thing, however. First, it only offers HDMI and analog VGA inputs. The adapter for DVI is provided. The speakers are not of high quality and if you are looking for acceptable sound while watching movies you'd better have your own external ones. The monitor displays nice pictures with good brightness and contrast and sharp text. One downside of this monitor is that it has a lot of backlight bleed. It is very noticeable in a dark with a black screen. On the other hand, under normal computer condition using windows its not as bad. Overall, this is not a bad product for its price.Cold Eyes"
4,"Hanns,G28"" Wide Screen Monitor","I have now owned this monitor for about 4 months. It is an excellent monitor with afew shortcomings. The instruction manual is very vague, I am having a problem with the brightness contrast contols as I am unable to adjust brightness, this did work in the begining but has ceased functioning. This has a 3 year warranty and how do I go about getting it serviced?"
2,beautiful except for dead pixel,This is a beautiful monitor. The large 28 inch size is really useful. I write medical imaging software so the large size was great for looking at multiple images. But it came with a dead pixel so I returned it. There are other large or nearly as large monitors with even higher resolution (1200 p are available and this is 1080p). All HannsG needs to do is increase quality control.
3,You get what you pay for.,"I've had this monitor for a few weeks now and have no complaints. The picture quality is very good. I know that there are better monitors and bigger monitors out there, but you can now get a good 28"" monitor at a reasonable price.Nov 2012 - This monitor started to die last spring and was done last summer. I was told by a techie friend that they are known for using cheap capacitors which don't last as long as they should."
4,"Great deal, does the job","I have purchased two of these monitors. They are a great buy. I have had no trouble with either in two months of use. I do not do extensive graphics work so I can only comment on this monitor use in business applications. For that purpose, it is great. Text is clear and images for my purposes are excellent. The stand is adjustable for angle only, not height adjustment--not always ideal. Angle of vision is fine. The speakers are very poor quality. I had no bad pixels on either monitor."
2,Short lifespan,"I was very pleased with this product, as it performed well above its price range. After about 15 months, the monitor flickered for about 20 minutes, then turned black. It has been non-functioning since. I would have given this product a 5-star rating, but after six promises to receive a phone call for an RMA from Hannspree, I down-graded them to 2-star (it is my belief that products can go bad, but it is only as good as the company behind it). After two weeks, I still don't have an RMA."
2,"Fantastic, til it stops working","I loved this monitor. I work from home and could put up everything I needed all at once on a single screen. I was a happy camper.Then, one day, it went black. I fiddled with settings. I fiddled with video drivers.. I fiddled with windows settings.. I fiddled with the operating temperature (cooling the room down). The monitor would work for a while, but, eventually (within a period of 5 to 20 minutes) it would simply go black again.I fiddled for 3 weeks with this...During my research I found that this is just what this monitor does after you have had it for a tad over a year. I am disappointed that some $2 part is probably at fault.Now I have a large chunk of electronic junk to dispose of properly."
5,Excellent balance between price and quality,"Just received my Hanns.G 28"" monitor yesterday and very pleased with the purchase. It is hooked up to a Mac Mini and the picture is crystal clear. It will be used for some light computing (browsing, email, word processing), but mostly for media (movies, iTunes, Hulu, EyeTV). Kids are mesmerized (we are currently watching a movie on Hulu). Outstanding value! Couldn't be more pleased!"
1,My Comp 28inch Monitor,I first got this product from Best Buy who gave me a 4 year warrentee after 18 months the monitor developed an un fixable fault. Best Buy were unable to replace this monitor with either the identical one or in fact any other 28in one. The could only offer me a 25in one. They gave me a store credit for $554 and I then bought the monitor from Amazon at considerably less tahn teh $554 however am still stuck with Best Buys store credit.I am confident that this is the best monitor for me despite haveing had a previous one that went faulty. The size and quality of the screen make it so much easier and confortable to work at home with.
1,"color shift is really bad, especially in the vertical axis","If you like to stand up at all and look at your monitor, don't buy this. If you're a good boy or girl and always sit down when you do your work, it's OK. I have an old dell 24"" that does not have this problem. When I look at my calendar, if I stand or even not seated just right, I can not tell which day is highlighted. Extremely annoying."
2,Good price but...,"Sure the price is good but the monitor is way too big and the resolution too low to work with at a standard desk. Plus, if you buy it from Amazon and decide, like I did, that it's just too damn big, and then return it, you will be charged a restocking fee. I would recommend a 23"" or 24"" monitor instead. I ended up with an Acer 23"" monitor which I am very pleased with..."
2,Hanns G Problems,This monitor was to be used as a monitor for a Mac Book Pro.The first monitor shipped did not work at all in any mode.The second monitor shipped had a vertical red line on the screen.No further monitors were shipped. I got a Samsung insteadthat works just great.
1,Died in less than three months,"I'll keep this review brief. While it worked, this was a great monitor. Really nice picture, fast refresh, no ghosting -- exactly what you'd want in a big screen LCD. Then, after about three months, the whole screen started turning white. Switch off monitor and then switch back on. It worked fine for about twenty minutes, then screen turned all white. Now it does it within five minutes of being switched on. Guaranteed, every time.Talked to Hanns.G. Need to ship it back, on my dime. So, if I want them to take a look at it, I have to pay $50 (must insure it apparently) to ship it to them. With no guarantee that they'll even fix it.Other people have complained about the screen turning white issue. It seems that it might be a not uncommon problem. My monitor was manufactured in August 2007, even though I bought it in August 2008. Maybe it was a bad batch.Anyway, I bought a 30inch Samsung monitor instead. And I absolutely love it."
1,"Run, don't walk from this company Hanns G products","This monitor worked great until it quit working after 13 months because of the ""white screen"" of death issue commented onby others. Called Hann G service, several times over several days, because I found something out. No matterwhat problem you say this monitor has besides ""It won't turn on"" the tech diagnoses the LCD panel is broken.Which means, that warranty is vapor. The LCD is warranted ONE year, other parts and service for 3 years. That's thecatch...my monitor, by the way, was diagnosed by another company as quite possibly a controller issue ona card which was heating up and internally shorting. Hanns G techs would not even consider it.Since found others with same experiences. Probably should be a class action lawsuit, but don't getsnookered by this bunch of warranty crooks. Buy a name brand."
5,"An honest, no-nonsense guide to the murky world of extra virgin olive oil","A wonderful book which reads like a travelogue for anybody who is interested in this super-food. As with wine, there can be a lot of 'airiness' about the subject of olive oil and that is why this book is so refreshing. Mr Quest-Ritson seems to blow the cobwebs away from the Extra Virgin Olive Oil world and gives it the dignity and truth it deserves. This book is worth its weight in gold."
4,Good travel guide,"Good reference if you are buying olive oil from lots of different countries, or going on a trip and want to include olive oil farms in your itinerary. Very well-written discussion of basic olive oil information. But check it out at your library before you buy. It is very good for what it is, but it may not be worth a spot on your home bookshelf."
1,Misleading,"When I ordered this product I thought I was getting 5 different flavors, instead I only got one and it tastes HORRIBLE."
3,Falcon! The New-Size Ford,"Since it's the only book available that covers Ford Falcons in any detail, it's better than nothing but could have been better. Mostly black and white photos of daily drivers and repetitive shots of convertible roofs being raised and lowered is less than I'd hoped for. Still, there's lots of good information in it. If you're a Falcon owner or fan, you'll want the book."
4,An ideal book for Falcon lovers.,"As us Australians see very few American Falcons here I was pleased to buy a copy of this book to see each model Falcon.This book filled the void on American Falcon literature.If you love these falcons,you're restoring one then this book is ideal for any car lover.The author also has several other books in the series."
3,FORD FALCONS -- A BETTER IDEA,"I love Ford Falcons. I really do. This book has some good factual information about Ford's better idea and some really cool pictures of this really cool car. (I think the coolest Falcons were the 1960-1965 sedans). I was disappointed that the majority of pictures showed Falcon convertibles with the tops being raised or lowered. I had hoped for more pictures of this really excellent classic sedan.Still, I enjoyed the book. For any Falcon lover, this book is a treat and one that will have you soaring down memory lane in your cool (cyber) Falcon! Just love that better idea Ford car!(Note: The Ford Ranchero, was a Falcon with a truck back 1960-65, the years that truck and its automobile counterpart looked their coolest to me. I love a Falcon car)!"
4,Great for restoration work,"Review by Michael--( the Amazon account is in Sharon's name)I suppose expectations play a large role in a given review.I bought the book as a reference work for the Falcon I was restoring. In that capacity, the book is great. The details that Ray Miller photographs are essential for this work. Have you ever gone to a flea market, and had a vendor absolutely swear that the door handle/tail light bucket/carpet/gas cap/etc. he had was ""correct""? The details in this book help to avoid wasted purchases. In that regard alone it is an asset to a restorer. Add in the extra material that begins each chapter, and the the Appendices, and you have a wealth of information that any Falcon fan can use.As a reference book that thoroughly documents the evolution of the Falcon, this book is a great success.If you want glossy, full page color photographs then look elsewhere."
1,Falcon: The New Size Ford,"WAY over priced for what you get. This is just a lot of tedious detail supported by black and white pictures of the tedious detail of such items as the door handles, headlight and tailight trim, the latch holding the trunk lid closed and pull knobs for the heater/defroster. This is definetly a case of ""don't judge this worthless book by the great cover"". At the price of this book I expected more color, reprints of the advertising, pricing information and information from Ford itself."
3,John Norum - 'Face The Truth' (Shrapnel),"'Face The Truth' is a decent solo effort by John Norum,the former guitarist for Europe(Remember them?Some say they're the Swedish reply to Bon Jovi).This CD also features bassist Peter Baltes(of Accept),drummer Hempo Hilder and Glenn Hughes on vocals.Musically,'Face...' is like semi-commercial metal,but at the same time,it's not cheezy sounding if you know what I mean.As for the tunes,I liked the title cut ""Face The Truth"",""Night Buzz"",""Time Will Find The Answer"" and his Thin Lizzy cover ""Don't Believe A Word"" the best.Check it out."
3,Norums sound solidifies on this second release,"This is the 2nd full length Norum album and the first two tracks rip. Worth the price of admission alone. There is also a duet with Joey Tempest - so by this time there was a thawing of the ice between them or something like that.The rest of the album gradually diminishes in quality although Good Man Shining rolls along nicely. Really, this is Norum getting more confident (perhaps now he was away from any commercial expectations) and building up to the great album that would be his third release, Another Destination."
4,Good,"""Face the truth"" is a solid album. I prefer the European version that contains a duet with Joey Tempest (Europe) on a song called ""We will be strong"". Other standouts are ""In your eyes"", ""Night buzz"" and the title track. John puts forth a great performance as usual, but this time does not do a majority of the lead vocals, deferring to Glenn Hughes. Hughes is a fine singer, but I prefer to hear Norum's voice on his own solo albums."
2,"Slightly bluish, burn out just like the rest","I have these installed in place of my parking lights in 2007 Infiniti G35x. They are mostly white, but when compared to the stock HIDs (which have a hint of yellow) look blue. They lasted much longer than POS LED I bought at Ijmtoy but already on my 3rd set (last about 8 months). ""Lifetime warranty"" - don't believe it; sent these back to the vendor and never heard back. Still, for the price they are OK, installing them is what I really don't like as it is a pain in my car.EDIT: Really cannot recommend them... I bought 3 sets of 2, and in less than 1.5 years ran through all 6 LEDs. Still pretty terrible, and the vendor does not honor the ""lifetime warranty"" replacement requests. Looking for other similar products with better durability."
4,LED's,Nice and white. If you look REALLY REALLY close you can see the yellow from the LED in my 06 Mazda 6 parking light housing. but I'm usually to distracted by the chrome housing to notice.
4,Great for the Price,"Really a simple, nice-looking pair of curtains. I just need something to keep out light at night and these are perfect for that. And the Color is almost exactly what I saw on the website. Thanks!"
3,Nothing great- a little too pricey for what you get.,Great material. It's nice and thick and feels very nice to the hands. I wouldn't recommend getting these because they are too pricey. It's cheaper to get custom made windows because after adding up the price you can save a lot more. These curtains are pretty simple. There's nothing special or unique about them other than the material itself. If you are going to pay top dollars for a nice window treatment get custom made. I wish I save them before purchasing. But I'm going to keep what I have and get custom drapes in other rooms.
2,Even a guitar god has bad days,"well, I love Tony's unique sound, and I like the fact that he experiments and tries to stay far from and standarized formula, always evolving. But Madness is a good example of what happens when you go to far from your roots, is sounds anything BUT Macalpine. Like a fusion of blues, funk, jazz art rock and I do not know what else, its sound like a mess to me. Thank God he left this style and returned to his real sound with jewels like Chromaticity."
5,weirdly beautiful,"The only other recording of Burmese piano music I know of was a French disc featuring the legendary Ko Ko. This one's better -- better playing and a much better recording. The way U Yee Nwe takes those ripping, percussive melodies from traditional Burmese saing waing and applies them to the western piano is, well, like the title says, spellbinding."
5,There is justice!,"Terry Moore could have gone either way - good or bad. Circumstances propelled her into the legal system, then into jail. A spunky gal, she didn't just sit around and wait for her time to be up. The result of this was a stay at Broward Correctional Institute, where, for the first time in her life, she was given a structured environment. But the excitement doesn't end there - in fact, it just begins. You'll find yourself experiencing the many emotions Terry did - disgust, hopelessness, hopefulness, love, and many more. It's an excellent representation of the legal system and what really goes on in prison. An excellent video!"
2,A little too cartoony for my tastes.,"I suppose this book is good for someone who is new to drawing. Most of the pictures are a little on the cartoony side. It explains basic drawing concepts like perspective, proportions, line width, etc. which is good for the beginner.I'm a seasoned artist and I guess I was hoping for a book with more diagrams and better explanation of the various parts of a chopper for more technical-oriented book. I bought this book on Amazon because it was cheap even though I've never seen the book before. I guess that's my fault."
1,Give me the original instead!,"I thought this tribute album would be quite nice because the original is the best rap album of all times and the rappers featured here are of the tightest today.That's a nice start for making a great tribute album, I thought. I've never been so disappointed as when I listened to this CD,ever! It fails on every little detail that made Straight Outta Compton so great. Where the original hit you in the face so hard that it left you bleeding this tribute doesn't even tickle your nose.The only track here worth mentioning is Compton's in the House, because that one is performed by MC Ren & Dr. Dre. I guess when you haven't heard the original you'll like this CD, but when you compare with the original....don't waste your money on this album. Go buy the original instead. Rappers doing cover versions of other rapper's tracks... Cover versions is for unoriginal pop singers and worn out rock groups, not rappers that have such skills as the ones featured here."
3,not the best tribute but okay,"won't lie there's a few bangers on here dresta, eiht, and king tee does straight outta compton it's okay it can't compare to the original versions with ren, cube, and eazy. mack 10 does dopeman it's cool and wc does if it ain't ruff since I'm a big fan of dub c I'll give it a pass jayo felony does okay on 8 ball still I prefer the original nwa versions."
1,A Tribute????,"This Cd Is A big let down to all N.W.A fans. Instead of the orignal songs, the tight beats, and the lyrics that make you run for the hills, this cd is full of new age rap stars that think that because they can rap, they can copy the greastest rap group in history, N.W.A. What the hell is Big Pun is doing on this album? He's latin! What the hell does he know about Compton.THIS ALBUM IS FULL OF RAPPERS WHO DON'T EVEN COME CLOSE TO THE LIKES OF DR.DRE, ICE CUBE, MC REN, AND EASY E.THIS ALBUM ....!"
4,jus cause its nwa.......4 stars,"its a shame that the real artists werent on the album, cause everybody misses dat hard s'. peace out"
5,"Big Puzzle, Educational",This puzzle when put together is about the size of a 5 year old. My kids 3 and 5 like playing with it. 5 year old can put it together with no help. Definitely educational.
5,Great fun for Bone lovers!,our 3 year old loves bones and he plays with this puzzle a lot. Pieces are soft but sturdy. Fit together easily. Not too complicated for a 3 year old. Pretty big when put together.
3,skeleton review,The puzzle was durable but not too educational. I made one myself that had a lot more educational value.
4,Skeleton puzzle,"My daughter has been interested in bones lately, and she love this puzzle. It is an educational puzzle and fun to play with. She like to lay down and compare her body. It is worth it!"
2,Not for an older child....,"I bought two of these, one for a 10 year old and one for an 11 year old. It was too small for them to really handle and play. They played with them for a few days, but it wasn't exactly what they needed for their age and size. They broke easy too. Would be nice for a younger child."
5,SLAMMIN!!!!!!!,"Dave Clarke is back with this sold release of new tracks. I've always been a fan of Dave since he can range from Electro, techno, Hip Hop, Disco House and still blend them together nicely into one set. Heres a breakdown on my favorite key tracks off this release:2. She's In Parties (This is a great electro remix of the classic Bauhaus darkwave track, sweet electro at its finest)3. Wiggle(nice Chicago House bootiness to this)4. Blue On Blue5. Deo Gratias6. Stay Out Of The Light7. Just Ride8. Dirt Box9. Disgraceland (nice taste in the ElectroClash arena with special guess Chicks on Speed on vocals)10. Wolf11. AddendumA very fun disk to have, check it out!"
2,Apt Subtitle...boring as a Filibuster,"I purchased this for use in my American Gov't class. I've never shown it b/c in previewing it I couldn't get through it. Dry and dull, and, therefore, reinforcing the very stereotypes of our governmental system that I am trying to break in the minds of my students."
5,ONE OF THE BEST FOR BEGINNERS,"WE CHECKED THIS BOOK OUT OF OUR LOCAL LIBRARY AFTER REVIEWING SEVERAL BOOKS. ALSO CHECKED AT BARNES AND NOBLE FOR COMPARISIONS AND FOUND THE SUNSET GARDEN POOLS FOUNTAINS AND WATERFALLS TO BE GOOD ALSO. THE INFO. CONTAINED DESIGN, INSTALLATION AND PUMP INFO. THE PICTURES ARE IN COLOR AND VERY PRACTICAL--NOT SOMETHING UNACHIEVEABLE. WE WILL USE IT AS ONE OF OUR GUIDES IN BUILDING A WATERFALL."
3,NOT QUITE WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR,"It may be that one book, alone, can't cover this topic. If there is one that can do the job, I haven't found it yet. Nash and Hughes offer some excellent information and provide many photos of well-designed water features for the yard. In addition to those, I was also looking for more step-by-step illustrations of pond and waterfall setups but this book was a little skimpy there The section on plant selection they've provided is very useful, however."
4,Excellent work Nick!,"I just purchased the album on iTunes yesterday and Nick Lachey has done a great job with this album. I'm glad that he was big enough to write down his feelings on paper and use them for therapy. Most of the songs sound pretty much the same but they are good songs. What's Left of Me is definitely the song of the album - great tempo and beat, Beautiful, Shades of Blue, Ghosts are all great songs as well, really show his feelings.However, my absolute favorite is Resolution - This song really shows Nick's depth and talent. You can really feel his pain while singing and it was simplistic!I am pulling for Nick to be successful with this album, I really feel like he's a genuine person who deserves success. He like many people has gone through a life-changing event for all to see and I believe he will come out on top! Way to go NICK!"
5,Absolutely Amazing,"I have always been a Nick Lachey fan ever since 98 Degrees first came out. They had great songs, but not the best. The last album was good, but it's nothing compared to this. Like he's said in interviews that this album has his heart and soul in it with so much emotion and you can hear it and you can see how passionate he was to help co-write 8 out of the 12 songs. I can honestly listen to this album all the way through without wanting to skip a song and that's hard to do with some albums. He is such a strong, amazing person and I praise him for being able to put together such great work given all the things he's going through. Jessica made a mistake in leaving him. I wish him the best of luck and I hope to see more great work from him."
1,"nice voice, but boring sounding songs","All these songs seem to sound the same to me. I personally think he has a great voice, but he could have used some variety with the type/style of songs he put on the album, the sounds on these songs - they all seem to have the same musical ""feel"" to them. His stuff on this album bores me. It sounds like music that many others have already done before him. I wouldn't waste my money on an album of songs that all seem to sound the same, or sounds like something I've already heard before. Maybe some of the music from when he was in 98 Degrees is better?"
4,"Haunting, raw and beautiful.","Tabloid [...] aside, I don't know the details of any stars life, but I heard this on the radio and became intrigued. This doesn't appear to be about His breakup...its about the struggles and pain of a man. This is definetly on the darker side, but my favorite poets are dark. There is such sadness, such emotion, resign, in this album. I know alot of people said there should have been more upbeat dance music, but this is more Art than Pop. Bravo for not being a cookie cutter song writer. Art happens when you get to the rawest of emotion. BRAVO!"
4,"Good, but a downer....","I really like Nick Lachey's voice so I bought this CD. He still has a good voice and I like most of the songs, but really a whole album about his split with Jessica? A few upbeat, lighter songs to mix it up would've made it 5 stars."
5,"""What's Left of Me""",Love the entire CD it is so awesome!!!! I get chills listening to song 12 you can hear the intensity in his voice and really feel what he's gone through. Great music best of luck to his career and life.God Bless!
3,I'll give him credit,"I don't like this guy...at all. I've never liked his music. However, AOL is letting people listen to the album for free and I gave it a chance and it's actually pretty good. Would I buy it? No. But for free it's worth a listen."
1,Sadness doesn't always equal good albums,"With a quick listen in Target, I must say that I wasn't impressed at all. Angst and emo lyrics are stricken in this album, and it sounds more generic with Backstreet Boys. He should definetly try hooking back up with 98 degrees, at least he had some dignity there."
2,Is the Divorce a Publicity Stunt?,"No, probably not, but it sure makes you wonder. Nick was always in the shadow of his wife. His first solo album flopped miserably. So now, after she dumps him, he releases this. ""Oh, I'm Nick Lachey. Nothing's left of me cuz my more popular wife left me. All of you fifteen year old girls should pity me and buy my album cuz I look so sad on the front."" Gimme a break. Does Nick have a good voice? Yes. But he is sickening and using his divorce to get a high profile....yet again, he is still using his wife. He'll probably thank her for divorcing him after this."
4,A very good solo album...,"This album is a soul searching output of what has obviously been a trying time in this young man's most recent life. There's alot to be said for pouring your emotions out and through your music. Nick's second attempt at a solo album is a hit in my opinion. No sticky, bubble gum pop, but a more adult, contemporary view of the world. The tunes are catchy and melodic; some a bit similar to others, but for the most part a nice addition to your ""today's"" music collection. Good 4 you, Mr. Lachey, for taking the high road and pouring your heart out so the rest of us can relate a little better."
4,Decent Album! Four and a Half Stars!,"Only reason I gave it 4 and a half stars is that all the songs sound somewhat the same...but I really like the formula Nick's using, which is the current teen pop-rock style employed by the producers of Lindsey Lohan, Kelly Clarkston, and Avril Lavagne. Here's to hoping this and future career milestones help establish his name outside of simply being Mr. Jessica Simpson, ex-newlywed cable TV star. Who knows? Perhaps Nick Lachey might outlast his 15 minutes of fame."
4,I can't give this a five but I actually like it,"I can't give this a five but I actually like it. My friend makes fun of me. I guess I can related to this break up music but it's actually good. Its weird because it takes either drugs, death, or breakups to make good music for most artists. I think this album is actually going to sell well. This is very passionate and you can tell he is hurting."
2,"Liked His ""Soulo"" CD Better.","His 1st CD was so much better, this is all ballads and he seems angry, maybe about his divorce, I enjoy his upbeat CD a lot more. Sad and boring."
5,Nick's Best Ever,"This album, you can tell, is coming from deep within his heart... you can hear the pain in his words!!! For anyone who has ever lost the one that they loved..you'll be able to relate w/ Nick.."
3,Average cd,"Nick's latest effort is about average. I think he should concentrate his efforts to putting 98 degrees back together. MTV should think about making a show on their reunion. That said, this album sounds too much like the sound backstreet boys did last year with their flop cd. Overall, Nick's best song still is ""This I Swear"" from his first cd."
1,like we wanna hear you wine over jessica,"this whole cd nick lets out how he feels after his painful divorce we had to endure your cheap hollywood marriage your lame reality show your sonny and cher revival so called variety show which I'm glad did'nt last too long then the divorce, now this spare us nick. and I pass this on by this is depressing."
3,Sing a Happy song,I like the fact that he had something to sing about. and he sang about it in a way he could connect to the people have this cd. But can a man wine anymore than he does about a lost love one song about losing love ok 2 is fine even but the whole record became depressing after a while I couldn't take it so if you are in the mood to be brought down by a person wining about love then this is the cd for you.
1,"""What's Left of Me""--Not much...","...after the divorce, nonexistent career and has-been, done-fad status. But still Nick keeps trying. I guess I can admire him for that. (pause) Mmm, actually, no, his music sucks, so I can't admire him. I COULD admire him if he started learning an instrument and actually tried to make music that doesn't cause auditory cancer, but that won't ever happen.His former band had, what, two, three studio albums that came out? Gee, I wonder why they had so few and broke up so soon.... Probably because they realized the market/fad for boybands faded out? Yeah, seems likely.Well, it goes without saying this is nothing but MTV garbage to appeal to the lowest of the masses. If you're looking for a good solo artist get Yngwie Malmsteen. Yngwie's a real musican. Nick Lachey is a wannabe singer who's more suited to be a model/fluffer."
3,This is a good album!,"I liked this album. I liked ""What's Left of Me"" from the first time I heard/saw it on tv so I bought the album. It's obviously an emotional and somewhat depressing album where he finally lets her with the last song ""Resolution"" (hard thing to do with a hottie like Jessica Simpson). The album shows off his true vocal and song writing abilities although some of the songs sound repetitious and similar. He is truly more talented than his ex-wife."
5,Strong and Confident Comeback,"I was highly anticipating the release of Nick's new cd. I was and still am absolutely captivated by his first single for this cd, the haunting track ""What's Left Of Me"". This is the Nick I first fell in love with. Every single track is a part of Nick's life and all that he is going through. This cd is absolutely stunning and everyone should have a copy. If you don't have this cd YET, go out and by it now! You'll never regret buying it. It is completely worth the money! Go Nick!"
5,Wow! This album is really good,Everyone should know who Nick Lachey is by now. Unless you have been living under a rock for the past few years you should of heard about him by now. This album is really REALLY good!!!! Hearing him express himself in his lyrics is really beautiful. I would definately go out and by this album if you are a fan or not. I think with this album Nick is going to do pretty good ;-)
5,NICKS BACK HOTTER THEN EVER !!!!!!!!!!!,"FIRST OF ALL FOR ALL YOU HATERS OUT THERE THAT THINKS NICK WOULD BE NO WHERE WITH OUT JESSICA SIMPSON IS NOT TRUE !! YOUR JUST JELOUS !!!!!!!!! JESSICA WOULDN'T BE HALF AS WHAT SHE IS NOW WITH OUT NICK ! NICK IS THE ONE WHO SET HER UP WITH A RECORD DEAL .. AND A MANAGER !!! THEY MET AT THE CHRISTMAS PARADE AND THEY FELL IN LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT .. SO IF ANYONE WANTS TO TALK TO A NICK AND JESSICA FAN CONTACT ME AND IM SURE WE CAN WORK THINGS OUT BECAUSE I KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT THEM .. I AM A ""TRUE"" FAN !! NICK IS BACK HOTTER THEN EVER !! YEAHHH BABY ! MOVE OVER JESSICA .. HERE I COME ..! <33"
1,soooooo bad,bad....bad.... SAD that I even bought it.upon thinking about it.was worst Idea I ever HAD.
5,One of the Great CDs in 2006!!!!!!!!!!!,Vocals of Nick Lachey really shines in his new album...very emotional and moving! I pre-ordered my copy and advise everyone to get theirs before the stores run out! Congratulations on your hardwork Nick!!!
4,Pretty Good,"I was surprised by this album not expecting much from this former boybander. But I gotta admit there are a few songs on this album that I enjoyed! He is definitely talented but I think he struggles shaking that boybander image that all of us hate. I think he really needs to dig deep, as he did with this record, and make music that speaks to people."
5,music for the soul,I really liked Nick's album because it came from his heart. I listened the entire album and my favorite song is beautiful. Money well spent!!!
4,AHHHHH!!! LEFT IN SHOCK!!!!,I totally thought this Cd was gonna suck!! Man...i was left with my mouth wide open. This is a GRRREAT CD...you can feel what Nicks feeling in every song...awsome CD...i really like it! Its not 5stars quite cause there are like 2 songs i dont really like but Nick did a real good job overall...hahah o and Jessica...gurl...your a fool.
4,Nick Can Sing Too!,I enjoy this selection of songs. I really like his singing better than Jessica's. Hopefully this CD will be more successful than his first album.
4,Nick Lachey has matured!,"I have been a fan of 98 Degree's and purchased Nick's first album as well. Although I liked 98 Degrees as a group better than Nick's first album, it still wasn't bad for his first solo attempt. However, Nick has really matured with his second effort. It is true, break-ups can really bring a lot of emotion out of someone, therefore producing some great music at the same time. On this album, Nick showed that he is a good writer and a better singer than what he was with his first album. The first 5 songs on this album are the best, especially ""What's Left Of Me"" and ""On Your Own"", but I think his singing in the falsetto voice with ""Resolution"" really show's his talent as a singer. The musical arrangements on this album were also much improved over the first one. I really recommend listening to this album a few times, and you will find yourself unable to stop playing it, like I have."
4,A Gem!,"This is a great album. Nick and his team have done a great job at giving it depth and soul, but also keeping some of the riffs airy and pleasant. It kind of reminds me of Kelly Clarkson's ""Breakaway"" album, only obviously with a male's voice. I didn't give it a perfect five because there is a song on there that I didn't think the lyrics meshed well...but otherwise really great. I think he needs to get more credit thatn it just being compared to his breakup from Jessica. I highly recommend listening to ""I can't Hate you anymore"", ""Shades of Blue"", and ""Resolution"""
1,It's the SAME OLD BOY BANDER thing,"You'd think 8 years after 98 Degrees were about, Nick's music would'ave matured. Well think again. It's just 1998 all over again, except this time even worse. Mr. Jessica Simpson decided that to to sell his album, he needed to sell out Jessica and make an entire album about their relationship.Better luck next time."
3,GOOD BUT DEPRESSING,"Isn't it ironic all the self-proclaimed rockers such as The Infidel and others claim to love rock music yet they are constantly listening to pop music....ummmm.Nick did a good job, he has a great voice and he's really showing his heart. But every song on this cd is depressing. I hope it was therapeutic for him and his next cd will be more cheerful. And rock fans if you don't like it stop listening to it....but pls STOP YOUR INCESSANT WHINNING."
3,A for effort and moving on ... but,"Each song is pretty good on its own, but as an album, in its entirety, it makes you want to slit your wrists. Props to Nick for moving on with his life and using his pain to fuel his art; however, it gets a bit too much. When Justin Timberlake's solo album debuted, he had just ended his relationship with Britney Spears. His pain and hurt was evident in a few songs, but he also included some other types of songs. Nick's album, in comparison is anything but subtle! The topic is present in each and every song.It gets old. Fast."
4,Nick,"Very good album. I love Resolution, Beautiful, and Run to Me. Nick will succeed with this album."
5,Gold Standard of this Field!,"I used this for a training manual for my new hires as private investigators, it is hands down one of the best books ever written on interviewing and interrogation techniques. Even the experienced people were raving about the information in it. Can't ask for better than that!"
4,A must read for Detective work,Even though this is a watered down version of the Reid Technique program it is still well worth the money. The subjects that are covered are very well done considering the length of the chapters. If you are entertaining the idea of paying to go to the full blown class but your not quite sure than buy this book to build up your appetite.
3,Christmas Pleasures,"Some of the movies were good, some were boring, and some were simply depressing. I want my holiday movies to make me smile and feel good about the movies."
3,Missing DVD,This was supposed to be 6 DVDs and an audio bonus. We got 2 of the same DVDs - only 5 movies and no audio bonus. Not what we were guaranteed.
3,Okay but not great,This has 2-3 nice movies but the rest are duds....not a complete waste as the price wasn't bad...just don't expect 6 great movies.
3,6-Film Holiday Collector's Set==good,"For the price the collector set was really good. I don't know if I'd buy them again, if I had not seen them but because I have them, I'll rewatch some of them next year."
2,Disappointing,"Out of the 6 movies, only 3 were watchable. The other 3 were very poor quality and hard to watch. I would not recommend this set."
3,So So,"I really was not impressed at all with these movies. The one everyone raved about ""A Christmas in Wales"" I was so geared up to see and could not believe anyone could watch more than 1/2 hour without turning it off. All of the acting was so stilted. It was a pain just to watch. However, three of the movies were fine but mostly predictable. It won't be one I will watch over and over but at least they weren't all bad."
3,Too bad!,The Christmas snow movie and Christmas in Whales brought the rating of this set down for me. I liked the other 4 movies quite well...great actually but was very disappointed in the two...otherwise I would have rated this a 4 star for sure!
3,Childs Christmas in Wales ithe gem,"The best film is is A Childs Christmas in Wales, its worth the money on its own, the other ones are ok."
2,boring,some of the movies were just plain weird.... i thought they would be normal stories made into movies... found it not very interesting... will only watch 3 of the movies again
3,6 movies,"nice for the holidays, good clean stories and great for everyone. I like 6 videos packaged in one cassette box."
4,Great holiday movies,wonderful price and there are a few of really good movies included. Nice to watch in July and dream of Christmas and hope that it comes soon! Good quality!
5,LOVE TO DO A MOVIE EVENING!,"Some of these movies I have seen and I can't wait to see the others. I love Christmas movies all year round. It's nice to has some intertaining fun movies when there's nothing else on TV. these are ""GO TOO MOVIES""."
5,Great Purchase,All of these movies are very good and I really enjoy them year-rround even though they are really Christmas movies! Good bargain if you love Holiday movies...
2,Poor Quality,"I was not impressed by the quality of the reproduction of these movies. Poor light and fuzzy images were the norm. But still, these are cheesy, feel-good, Christmas movies that we like to watch during the holiday season."
5,6-Film Holiday Collector's Set,"The best movies that were on this DVD were ""Borrowed Hearts"" and ""Music of the Heart."" Both of them were Outstanding, both were a 5 STAR rating. The other movies ones were not that great but with the price that I paid for these 2 movies, it was well worth it."
5,Lots of Trading Fun.....,"Author, Beatrice Schenk de Regniers and illustrator, Irene Haas are back with a reworking of their 1957 timeless treasure, and Was It A Good Trade? is as fresh and entertaining today as it was forty-five years ago. Based on an old folk song, Ms de Regniers lilting text is full of rhyme, rhythm, and fun, and preschoolers will enjoy singing the repetitive refrain along with you, ""Was it a good trade?/Was it a bad trade?/Was it a good trade-/hey?"" Ms Haas' charming, bright and colorful artwork captures and highlights the text beautifully, and is rich in expressive detail, humor, and vibrant eye-catching patterns. With a delightfully silly twist at the end to tickle your funny bone, Was It A Good Trade? is an engaging classic to share with friends and family now, and future generations in the years to come."
2,doesn't work well,"This product (the cream part at least) seems okay. It is quite thick, it did diminish the look of slight crows feet (I'm 33) after the first use. I have no clue what the point of the ""elixer"" is. This does not de-puff or really serve any purpose. I also had a very bad reaction to this product and I do not have sensitive skin nor have I ever had an allergic reaction to a moisturizing product. It burned the outer corners of my eyes so badly, I have red marks there now. I threw this out after one use. Would not purchase again. Will be sticking with my Clinique"
4,Good Allens for the Price,The wrenches have a good feel to them. They engage nicely and fit and finish is good. The stand as others have stated is on the cheap side and takes up more space than it should on the work bench. The ball ends only go down to 5/32. The rest are straight. Overall a nice set that feel like they will last. I purchased this set and the metric as I needed T-handle allens that did not have the plastic bulky handle.
5,Throw away that seed and give your bird a life!,"Until a few years ago, all bird foods were developed off the poultry production model -- that is, made for birds who didn't live more than a few months and weren't expected to have any quality of life. If there are birds in your life and you love them, get this book and take it to heart."
5,It's the best!,"If you only had one book to put you on the right path to caring for an exotic bird, this would be it! Easy to understand, puts the natural care of birds in a common sense place. I refer to it constantly!"
3,Amazing fretwork.,"Tony is a wonderful player. I don't know why, but he has never really 'broken-thru' a la a Steve Vai or Satch, but he certainly has comparable chops. This is a good record filled with great guitar work. A few songs are pretty flat, but overall it keeps your attention and occasionally provides you with chills up and down your spine. Check it out if you can ever find it."
1,ARE YOU KIDDING ME???!!!!!,"Who would buy this? I'm willing to bet there are less people buying this than there are that support either of the two. hahahaha. ""Women Love Dick (Cheney)""?? HAHAHAHAHA Who are these women? Is one named Ann? This is by far the most far reaching bumper sticker I've seen."
2,Its Okay,I tried this item as a moisturizer for my face. It's light and non greasy and had a pleasant vanilla fragerance. I can't really comment on pH or balancing of my skin type...since my skin is fairly good as is. That being said...I didn't think that this product provided great moisturization. I returned to Oil of Olay. It was less expensive and had a UV protector which this product does not. Maybe this product would be good for a twentysomething. For a fortysomething...there's definitely better (more serious) products out there for the money.
3,WELL-REASONED ... BUT NOT CONCLUSIVE,"Smiga makes his case after careful preparation and a thorough establishment of fact. His analysis, however, is tentative and almost reluctant. As a result, the conclusion of this text is anti-climactic and without real appeal."
3,eh...it's ok,"This case is ok for the money. If you want to have your G-Note on your hip....the only things that I dont like is the leather doesnt fit the phone perfect, but hey....it works"
1,torn out pages,I know i was buying a used book but i was not told over 50 pages will be torn out of the book. Very unprofessional and very deceitful. The book was missing chapter after chapter and i was not told ahead of time.!
4,"Highly recommended. Smart, well-written, very accessible.","An excellent and impressive treatment of a complex subject. With all the hype about investing in the stock market (and with recent the market swings up and down) it's great to have a basic primer that lays everything out in clear and easily understood language. I'm buying this book for my elderly mother, for friends who have wanted to try investing but have been afraid, and anyone intimidated by the jargon spewed by the financial media, which assumes a level of knowledge and experience beyond the typical American consumer."
5,Better than paper and worth the money,"Three cars and a pickup truck in my household and they all have K&N air filters in them. The initial cost may seem a bit high but over time the K&N filter will save you big bucks. Put the sticker that comes with it on your air cleaner housing to let the mechanics know you are wise to their game. Now, instead of telling me I need a new paper filter at 25+ dollars a pop, they offer to clean my K&N for 10 bucks. I just say ""no thank you"" - oh, well, sometimes I laugh."
5,K&N Filters 33-2064,"All my cars have the K&N filters because works like a champ and evidence of increased power and definitely makes the engine runs/performed smoother/better. Never have to buy filter anymore and highly recommended if you want satisfaction and lots of savings. Bought thru Amazon, secured, faster and cost less..."
4,Near mastery,"Denison Marrs practically nailed spacey, textured rock with their second release, and this third album finds them nearly doing the same with crisp guitar driven pop rock. Gone are most of the guitar effects, and in their place are some buzzing riffs and almost dirty bass lines. Melodies and choruses are the highlight, such as on ""What Life Is"" and ""The Real Ones"", and when the band finds a hook and works in interesting verses, they're amazing. Where they lack is in the simplistic lyrics and the songs where the verses aren't interesting enough (""This Is All The Time We Have"", ""Rescue Mission""); they seem to go on auto pilot from time to time. The ultimate outcome, however, is a rewarding, inspiring pop album."
3,"Expensive, but functional","This product serves its purpose, but I don't think it's going to last forever. The arm band keeps it secure while I jog, but I don't like the velcro on the bottom so that if it comes undone, the mp3 player will easily fall out. It isn't especially high quality, but it works."
4,DLO Action Jacket for SanDisk Sansa e200 (Black),Works well enough. I wish there was a openning to the lock switch on the top. You have to remove the player to get to the switch.
3,watch the screen,"While i am perfectly happy with what this case has done for me when it comes to working out at the gym or going for a run, i am incredibly unimpressed with the job the screen protector has done. I already have two scratches in the screen even though the player was litterally brand new and out of the bow just long enough for me to put it in said protective case."
4,What more can you ask?,"The Sansa e200 fits perfectly in the jacket and the jacket attaches nicely around the arm for hands free use during workouts or yard work. A bit pricey, but it certainly is perfect for its intended use."
5,Exactly as Described,I highly recommend this product. It protects the SanDisk Sansa well. It's great that both the arm band and a belt clip are included.
2,Horrible Quality!!!,"Horrible QualityAll told, I paid 25 bucks for what seems to worth 25 cents at best. It doesn't fit properly, it leaves glue residue on my Sansa and the ""hole"" to turn the thumbwheel is way off center, rendering it almost useless! Really bad product! I think blind folded pigmies with their hands tied around their backs made these. Do not buy this overpriced piece of garbage!"
2,Not for the runner,After finding a gazzilion different armbands on amazon I am unhappy that I bought this arm band in the store. The case makes it hard to operate the buttons. The wheel slips around in the case. The design is silly. The velcro closes on the bottom where you insert your player into the case so if it opens you are screwed. The armband is horrible. You need to use the belt clip to attatch it tot he band. It's flops around when running and sticks out to far. I am hoping the next band I orders is better and more of a lower profile. Hopefully the customer reviews were right.
4,"Great product, serves its purpose, but a little pricey.","I purchased this action jacket as an accessory to go with my new Sansa e200 mp3 player. I bought the mp3 player mainly to take with me when I go walking, so I thought the action jacket would be perfect. It is really nice for when you go walking or running, because it's adjustable for your arm and it leaves you free to swing your arms without the earphone cord getting in the way. The jacket, however, is a little snug and I have trouble getting it out. It definitely serves its purpose, but I thought it was a little expensive. I would recommend it."
2,"Not for action, disappointing","This case does not work well for running or other vigorous activity. Case attaches to armband with belt clip, the result is high profile and unstable and looks way un-cool overall. Maybe not bad to use with the belt clip while walking. Adds a lot of bulk to what is already a bulky player. Note that case does not look like the main photo on Amazon."
2,A Snoozer,"I order this one because I like model railroads. I still like model railroads but this video was a wasted 20 minutes of my life. It has little to recommend it.Basically, it is just a series of shots of the large scale (G Scale) electric train layout from the Living Desert in California. There is no narration. There are just views of the toylike trains going about their rounds.Some of the model structure are impressive, particularly the double track wooden trestle, but it was not interesting enough to keep my attention. Only in the last minute is there any voiceover to overcome the ""soundtrack"" but even that is just an invitation to visit the park.As advertising for the park, this is singularly ineffective. As entertainment it is even less so and I love trains.Save your money and your time."
3,Pricey Tome with a Pompous Title,"This is basically a textbook at textbook's price, useful for reference only. Too theoretical and technical to be practical. One wonders how one can apply anything written in it, other than feeling impressed by the book's size and the editors' learning. Read it for pleasure if you dare! Many chapters written by Fabozzi, but very few actually by Markowitz. I feel good having a book edited by a Nobel prizewinner sitting on my shelf among my other investment books (and I have many) but that's about all I can say about it."
5,Yet another masterpiece!,"The transition from somewhat aimless humor and action to the gripping ""conclusion"" is fairly abrupt, which is why it seems like a finale when it's really about a third of the book. However, that's not a complaint. It easily lives up to the first two books, and it certainly has a distinct style - you should read it even if you didn't enjoy them."
5,A Great Fantasy,"So far, I think this is Alexander's best book yet. He blends humor, action, and adventure in a way most of us can only dream of. I would recomend this book to 5th graders or higher it is a little hard to understand."
4,The Castle of Llyr,"The Castle of Llyr is the third of the Prydain Chronicles. In this exciting adventure, Taran and Eilonwy are sepparated. Eilonwy is sent to a castle, where she is to learn proper ""lady"" etiquette. On Taran's visit with his companion, he notices something strange. The next day, Eilonwy is gone. This was a great book of adventure and fantasy. I would say it is the best in the five book series, and reccomend it to anyone who likes a good read."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"The princess needs a bit of deportment apparently.When you decide you need to work on the aristocratic side of a girl, of course you would send her off with a pig keeper and a beast man, wouldn't you?Because of this, and a bit of a princess triangle, they all end up in a Land of the Giants type scenario, or at least in part.Here, along with a bit of magic, is a fantasy book where a crow actually comes in useful as a good thing."
4,gnome,I beleve that the book could have been better but unfortuneatly the author decited not to make it quite so exicting and have eilonwy fight and defete the dark enchantiss. I also think theat glew should have ended up as a small gnome but how can I decide how the book ends up turning out.
3,so-so game,"This game may be fine for a reading 5 or 6 year old, maybe a 7 yr old. We have played it one time with our 8 year old and will probably play about 2 or 3 more times with the variants and then I will get rid of it. The skeleton is not that detailed which didn't concern me because I thought the quiz cards would be more in depth. They are not. They are simple and we went through all the questions about half way through the game, getting most of them right that first time through - including the eight year old who has had no concentrated ""Human Body"" studies at all yet. Unless the quiz cards got harder by degrees, this game wouldn't last a family for very long. Might be of use to reuse in a grade school setting every year."
5,Perfect for a variety of ages,"I homeschool my 4 kids: ages 4, 5, 9, and 10. We played the simple version (there are six different versions/games) and all of us could participate (I helped the littlest child, it's only up to 4 players). It was great for learning the major bones of the body, and we found it very easy to learn and fun to play!"
5,It just don't get no better'n this...,"It just don't get no better'n this, folks...Honestly...I saw DBFS a few times at a local BG music festival, and, then, finally purcahsed a few CDs, and, brother, I could not have been more pleased.This band just ROCKS!And this CD here is my absolute favorite of theirs, and my absolute favorite Gospel record of ALL time.There's' not a song on here that doesn't make me want to either dance or cry.If you like bluegrass, you MUST have this disc. If you like bleugrass gospel music, you haven't lived until you've heard it."
1,Only a Duck should Quack,"As a former NSA member who was promoted into a more secret society, I MUST give this book only one star. But it is a Magic star with the intensity and power that I found in the pages of this book."
3,"Okay book, but much better are out on the topic....","This book seems to get great reviews, but I just wasn't terribly impressed. There aren't a lot of nitty gritty details in the book. It really just seems like one big general overview....which I wanted much more than that. Particularly annoying are the dialogue sections at the end of each chapter between her and ""parents"". These parents ask her some good pointed questions and in her replies, she never answers the question. I don't know how many times I thought...yeah, I wonder that too...only to have her evade the tough question and come off sounding like an authoritative know-it-all. There are some good parts to it, like her description of the senses and about rhythms, but overall I would recommend other books on the subject before this one. You Are Your Childs First Teacher by Dancy is much much better!"
4,Enlightening...,"I think this book is very insightful in alternative ways of parenting. It makes you stand back a minute and think of how your child might percieve our parental actions. Often it is hard for an adult to see through the eyes of a child. This helps a bit. It is not something that you need to strictly adhere to, they are ideas that you may try to incorporate into your style of parenting. Whether you are going the Waldorf route or not, I think many parents can gather insight about parenting from this...(A side note to the tub cleaning reviewer - try biodegradable cleaning products or give your son a bucket full of soapy water and a sponge, or a spray bottle filled with plain water, he doesn't need to know that he doesn't have the same cleaning solution that you do...it's the fact that he wants to clean with you...someday he won't want to do all these things with you...and you'll fondly look back on the times that he did - that we all need to remember.)"
3,"Good, easy introduction to Waldorf, but . . .","While I really enjoyed this book, and it was an easy read, AND it introduced me to the world of Waldorf, I must say that I have since read two other books that have more information and make this book a bit obsolete for me. One was Simplicity Parenting by Kim John Payne, and the other was You are Your Child's First Teacher by Rahima Baldwin Dancy. I did, however, like the stories, songs, and blessings included in the back of the book."
3,Who Killed the Father?,"You won't know for a long, long time which of his 4 sons comitted the parricide, but everything is revealed and explained in the end. I know people who have begun this book but not been able to finish it because of its turgid, over-long quality. The plot is okay, but way too slow and drawn-out, way too padded out with unnecessary philosophical and theological dialogue that distracts you from the storyline and adds little to it. Read ""Crime and Punishment"" instead, it's more gripping and much more compactly written, a far more engaging murder novel by the same indisputable master.David Rehakauthor of ""A Young Girl's Crimes"""
5,Great book,"This is a ripping good mystery story with a moral point; that ideas have consequences. Who killed Dad and why? Read, find out,and ponder the implications."
2,Kindle Edition full of Typos,"This is a review for the kindle edition specifically and not a reflection on this wonderful novel. There many many errors and typos throughout this book. They are (perhaps fortunately?) concentrated in the first half with a very frustrating section about 10% through which is barely intelligible for all the formatting and typographical issues. I read the full book before posting this review so it is ultimately readable if annoying. Unless price is the major factor, I would consider another edition."
3,Hard to get into,Trying to get into this book but very hard to do. I have heard a lot about this book and I spent a year in the USSR so I really want to read it.
5,Great Read!,"I really loved this book, it was thoughtful and inspirational. The other reviews made me interested to see if it was really that great and it is!"
4,Interesting,"This book, of course, is a classic. It poses questions for people of all eras, but through the lens of nineteenth century Russia. One sees typical Dostoyevsky themes, that is characters who are bound by their society and the sociology of that group. He gives you Christlike goodness stacked against criminal activity. Both, in their own way, throw over the traces of their society, and that society hardly knows what to do about them. Also those characters that are not hysterical most of the time are schizoid in personality, swinging back and forth between anger and happiness. It is a read for patient people."
3,Deeply Philosophical,"A wordy, talky, overly long, melodramatic, often bombastic, deeply philosophical story with flashes of brilliance and wit. It includes in depth discussion and debate about God, free will, evil, morality, and psychology hung on the framework of a sometimes forced and disjointed tale. For me, Ivan's discussions with (or hallucinations about) the devil, which occur near the end of the book, were a high point. The devil's argument that he could not repent because then mankind would have no story made me laugh. I kept thinking that a better translation might make this more fluid to read, but I have no desire to find another translation and read this again."
3,Horrible Kindle Version,"This Kindle version was so bad, I deleted it and paid $9.99 forThe Brothers Karamazov: A Novel in Four Parts With Epilogue.You can find my review of the actual book on that link also, which is why I rated this one with Three Stars as I don't want to downrate the story."
2,No,"I did not like this book. Very tedious, having read it I would not read any other of the authors novels."
2,poor grammer,"I gave this edition a two because of type errors,pages missing and two or three sentences in the beginning had superimposed letters......Very poor editing...... @"
5,Gorgeous beadwork!,"Inspirational...helps get your own creative ideas going when you see some of the incredible stuff other bead artists are doing. Has a small how-to section which is not very helpful, but the photographs are wonderful."
3,No patterns,"The cover of the book was beautiful and I thought the patterns would be included. While the book has great inspirational pictures of work, it was disappointing that no patterns were included. I think from now on I will read reviews for the books before I buy a book. The work in the book is beautiful."
4,The New Beadwork,"This was the first book on artistic beadwork I ever read. Though the creative boundaries in beadwork are being pushed all the time now, this book from 1992 was, for me, an eye-opening introduction to the use of beadwork to create art, not just jewelry. I still have a real fondness for the huge seed bead installation imitating swirling water--just magical!"
3,Book review,"This book was very helpful in my conversion to an eight cylinder Rover engine, however, the book itself is of low quality especially the binding.Pages were falling out after the first reading. Expensive book for this to be happening."
4,"Another Great ""Bottle"" Episode","By the time this episode aired, NBC and Desilu had began to realize what TV viewers already knew: Star Trek's ""Bottle Shows"" -or those taking place entirely or mostly on the Enterprise- were frequently the best ones, and ""Day of the Dove"" was no exception.This episode is Star Trek with it's powerful moral subtext at it's best, clearly showing the insanity of race hatred and the futility of war. It has great scenes and lines, beginning with the smack in the mouth Kirk receives from Kang, to the ending scene of Kirk, Kang, and company all making merry to drive out an evil alien that thrives on hate.Special FX were also quite good for the day, and this episode features a Klingon Battle Cruiser getting blown to bits by the Enterprise (the only episode showing this). But, you won't see this on TV, this scene is frequently deleted in reruns to save time for more commercials. Get the tape!"
5,What is War Good For?,Season Three is one of the most underrated seasons of all of Star Trek. I personally find it much better than the Second Season. Jerome Bixby is one of my favorite Star Trek writers. Every episode he wrote was good. I highly recommend this episode. I don't want to give too much away but the ending excellent because it showed Humans and Klingons working together. Didn't we hear this prediction in Errand of Mercy?
3,Another step in understanding the Klingons.,"Not to be confused with ""Balance of Power"", which is the episode that the other reviewer discussed. ""Day of the Dove"" is a story about battling with Klingons. It exposes some of the myths that both sides believe about the other. As with some other episodes, trouble is averted by thinking happy thoughts."
5,"AeroBed Premier Pillowtop, Full","The Premier Pillowtop is much more comfortable than the Premier classic. I bought a Premier classic, but it was so hard to sleep on, and I had to return it. so I decided to try this Pillowtop instead. I was so happy about the purchase. It is $30 more than the classic, but it is definitely worth the money.It is so comfortable that you feel like sleeping on a regular mattress.It came with a white fitted sheet, which does not show on the picture.If you are looking for something for trips, guests... then this is the one. Highly recommended!!!"
3,disappointed again,I bought this bed last year due to a bad back . It has leaked on the welded seams numerous times . I have repaired them it was ok for two weeks then I air pocket formed making it unable to sleep on. The customer service could be better. I have had two replacement beds in one year due to defects. Don't buy aero bed products. I won't ever again.
3,aerobed,"It worked great for a year or so, then started developing leaks. Very comfy! I used it to replace my waterbed. I have retired it and replaced it with a cheap camping style bed."
2,a terrible disappointment,"I've bought that book 'cause I'm planning to transform a small corner of my garden into a nice patio. But this book is about balconies, sky gardens, decks, pools, back yards, seaside retreats, etc...Nothing about patios!!! If you're looking for ideas for your patio, this probably isn't a good book for you."
3,Not necessarily for US Gardeners,What Jamie does is just amazing. This was obviously earlier in his career and completed in Australia.If you are looking for overall design ideas this is great. If you are looking for planting ideas for the USAI would not look here.
2,not framed well AT ALL,"I was pretty disappointed upon receiving this. The poster inside the frame had multiple bends and creases which are easily visible and create glares, as if the framing process was rushed and done carelessly. Also, the picture itself is really dark, and a lot of the details cannot be seen. Will probably not be buying from PosterRevolution anymore..."
4,An Exciting Project and a Great Achievement!,"It's so exciting when artists get together on a creative project! In this book little known fantasy artists (including me) pooled efforts and resources to produce an inspiring book containing an amazing range of fantasy artwork all produced in 2005. There's something here for every fantasy fan, whether you like intricate fairy designs with glowing colours, oil paintings or atmospheric digital work, detailed pencil drawings or dragons portrayed with a touch of humour. The artists' websites and email addresses are included in the book so you can find more work by your favourite artists online. I can't wait for this year's book which I'm sure will be bigger and even better!I heartily recommend this book to students, artists interested in participating in the project in future and anyone who'd like to discover new fantasy artists."
1,AN ALMOST UNWATCHABLE DVD VERSION,"I've been eager to acquire this film on DVD because it's one of the masterpieces of the golden age of Mexican cinema, with outstanding cinematography and a marvelous, romantic story; however, after purchasing it, I was very disappointed with the overall technical quality of this particular DVD version, but that's just my opinion as a consumer who prefers more pristine versions of great motion pictures. This movie won the Grand Prix in Cannes in 1946! It deserves a much, much better edition on DVD. If you have not seen this excellent classic--it was photographed by the very GREAT Gabriel Figueroa, and all the more reason why a more pristine version would have been fabulous--I think you'll find it quite moving and beautiful."
1,Language Barrier,"The DVD arrived without subtitles or English, I had previously checked for this and perhaps misunderstood as the way it was written. I am grateful that a refund has been recorded."
5,This album is the best imported CD I got !,"This album has almost every remix made by the Vengaboys! If you want remixes of the Vengaboys should get this, & it's @ a great prices too.1. We're Going To Ibiza (Hitculb Airplay) 2. We Like To Party (More Airplay) 3. Boom Boom Boom Boom (XXL Version) 4. Up & Down (Video Mix) 5. Ho Ho Vengaboys (XXL Version) 6. To Brazil (XXL) 7.

3,A nice All-Black cast production,"This is a nice effort by Spencer Williams, an independent filmmaker better known as Andy of The Amos and Andy TV Show. However, this film is often incorrectly listed as featuring Mantan Moreland (including here at Amazon). Mantan is NOT in this film."
5,Best band ever to exist in Latin Music,I recommend this purchase to anyone. Best latin music ever to exist. I have all their music from day one.
2,Tremenda Decepcion!!!,"I am an incredibly big fan of Mana. One of my favorite bands of all time. I bought this CD hoping it would be as good as Sueños Liquidos but this CD falls short, WAY short. The songs are very slow and have yet to grow on me. Two of the songs are VERY good, but over all the CD is a disappointment.If you like the liveliness and spirit of Mana's music, you wont like this CD. If you like the message and the power of the lyrics in Mana's music you will like this CD."
2,Mana is going back to school.,"With more than 10 years in the business, you would expect Mana to provide breakthrough material with every new album. Instead, with songs like Fe, Sin Tu Cariño, and ¿Por Qué Te Vas?, one might wonder if Fher's niece was behind all the writing, it's child's play. Musically, Mana's songs lack innovation. They still think that playing the same notes over and over makes a hit. Best song however: Sabanas Frias, guest-starring Ruben Blades, who was also the writer for the best song in Mana's MTV Unplugged, Desapariciones (hmmm...I see a pattern). Hopefully, these rock veterans can get it together in time for their next album."
1,They dont even deserve one star!,"Mana is Mexico's worst ""Rock"" ? Band....I mean they used to create good tunes before, but now?? They'd never written good lyrics but their music was into a good vibe, but now after don't know how many albums that sound the same, just stop listening to them....The aongs in all their records talk about Hearts broken, The ESPINAS, How Juan was left by his girl, How theyt love Tequila and drink as a dog because some girl left them.....In one word: MANA s.uc.k.s!Instead you should listen to KINKY, BABASONICOS, BUNBURY, JUMBO, CERATI and even LA LEY or JAGUARES....... EN fin, pero si te metiste a checar por esta musica es que de plano oye pura caca..... NO COMPRES ESTE DISCO!"
1,"MANA, EL PEOR GRUPO DEL MUNDO","Es increible que despues de mas de 15 años, mana sigue sonando EXACTAMENTE IGUAL, muestra de la poca imaginacion y ganas de evolucionar de este grupo, y si encima, le agregamos que por mas esfuerzos que hacen por copiar a The Police (con un toque congalero) no logran ni por mucho conjuntar una buena cancion.. tenemos que mana, en efecto es el PEOR grupo en la hostoria del Rock en Mexico, pero que le vamos a hacer, a los nacos les gusta la porqueria . ."
5,the best,This has to be the best Mana album so far. The CD is full of hits. I've been listening to it since its release and I am still not bored. Revolucion de Amor and MTV Unplugged are the two Mana cds that I listen to the most.
4,Songs that make it worth your money,"Two songs in this CD, Mariposa Traicionera and Sábanas Frías, alone were worth my money. The album is more ""rock"" than Sueños Líquidos, so if you like Maná's slower songs you might be disappointed. I like their slower fare better but like the two songs above so much I don't mind skipping over the other songs to get to them. I don't regret buying it one bit!"
3,Mas de lo mismo,"Para quienes escuchen este album por primera vez, disfrutarán de excelente interpretación de guitarras y percusión. Un muy buen ejemplo de música producida en Latinoamércia.Sin embargo, para aquellos que conocen las canciones de Maná, notarán que este disco es exactamente igual a los anteriores. Las canciones comienzan con melodías similares, los solos son iguales y las líricas narran historias similares. Incluso, los intérpretes aún tienen los mismos cabellos largos y el mismo look de hace muchos años. No hay ninguna *revolución* aquí.Maná puede hacer música mucho mejor que ésta. Esperemos por un próximo disco."
3,VERY UNEXPECTED,"I am a long time mana fan, and this album was a real downer for me. Mana used to be a lively band, that played energetic songs that brightened anybody's day, or that made you feel like singing even in your saddest moments. This album is very dark, almost gloomy. I think they are trying to be ""cool"", and IF THERE'S A BAND THAT DOES NOT NEED THAT, IT'S MANA! Anyways, in sum, I like the old mana stuff a lot, lot more. And I'm surprised after so many years in silence, they come out with a style that is so different...so anti-Mana!"
3,NOTHING NEW TO SHOW!!,"Mana is one of the top commercial latino band. but this cd (revolucion de amor) is not a really good cd. i think they can do much better. i gave them 3 stars because the only two good songs on this album are REALLY AMAZING ....""eres mi relegion"" and ""mariposa traicionera"" save the cd from disaster... ""angel de amor"" the first single is ok but no really good. the rest of the songs are really bad. Santana and Ruben blades participated on this cd..but still is not a good album."
2,Disappointing ...,"A very disappointing and souless effort by Maná. As soon as you hear the opening track with Santana, ""Justicia, Tierra Y Libertad"" you know right off bat that this is not the sharpest they've been. The 5 year lay-off might have indeed hurt them more than expected, as they probably should have written a new follow-up album to ""Sueños Liquidos"" as soon as possible while they were on a roll. Everything on this album is so predictable and deriritive of their past albums it's not even worth buying. Unfortunately, they have struck out under the pressure of coming up with a follow-up to their last album."
2,5 Years is to long a wait,"After five years Mana returns with an un-inspired album that lacks focus. I am a die hard Mana fan but after listening to this album I was fairly disapointed I only liked 4 of the 11 songs. You can actually hear Fhers voice breaking down...and Alex should stick to drumming. Best songs on the album are Mariposa de Amor, Pobre de Juan , and Sabanas Frias..."
4,Their lead singer sounds like STING!,"The first time I heard Mana, I thought Sting came out with another Spanish themed album! The lead singer of Mana Really sounds like Sting, try listening to their '97 album ""Suenos Liquidos"" Am I the only one that thinks that? Musically, they're an excellent band."
2,Same tunes and lyrics as before,Not asking to recreate music however after Sueno Liquido nothing innovated has come out of the band.4 of 13 songs are goodMariposaSabana'sAngel De AmorMi Religion
2,Not Much for Your Money,"I love the frosted pink color and small size of this bag, but the quality of the materials is underwhelming. The bag looks and feels like very cheap plastic. Frankly, I did not think this bag was worth the price, but the vendor's return fees were so high (nearly 50% of the purchase price) that I kept it anyway. I recommend checking this one out in an actual store before deciding to buy it. I've never before been so disappointed in a Nine West item."
1,Unusual for me... but I think this is awful,"So... I already own the movie Baraka... sound track, visuals, no dialog. I also enjoy meditation and have tried binaural beats. No stranger to media that is an aide to relaxation or resonating quiet sits, I thought I would enjoy this. It just comes off cheaply made and the music is lousy, IMO. Oh well, a loss. Maybe the library will take it as a donation, but then again... why would I do that to my local library? Pah..."
1,"really poorly written...full of judgements, insults, hate","The book is a compilation of poorly-researched essays, really poorly done, each belaboring bellyache ideas that we all, quite frankly, grew tired of back in high school. Example...the ridiculous diatribe into 'who is and who is not a native'. Haven't we all grown sick of that racist measuring stick yet?Unfortunately, each essay follows the same tired format. All are made up of stereotypes, promoting such yowlers as 'all Whites think this way, vs. all indigenous people think that way...'; drawn-out complaints without substantiation, such as 'all non-native professors use gatekeeping to keep out indigenous scholars', and the like.The book is for truly hateful, bigoted people who wish to foster an environment of fear in the academy and for those interested in engaging in senseless, time-wasting, essentialist arguments.Save your money and time and work for justice."
5,good stuff from precious minds,"Joan Retallack is immensely gifted. If you're familiar with John Cage, you'll like this book. If you're not too familiar with John Cage, well, I have someone I'd like you to meet.This is entertaining, compelling, thought-provoking stuff. I can think of few other people who are so mindful of WORD USAGE, or in this case, I guess, WORD ""USCAGE."" Many insights in this book. I recommend it highly."
5,Excellent sequel,"Prompted by reading the first in the series and looking forward to the next in the series, Moberg does an excellent job of sharing how the transitions affect the characters."
5,Excellent reading colonial history,"Moberg is an excellent story teller, compelling characters, attentive to period detail. Puts you in 1840-1870 time frame. Swedish immigrants. Series highly recommended."
3,"Love the Glasses, but...","I originally bought the Fang Horn/TNS polorized lens. Loved the so much that I bought a pair of black polorized. I wore the Horn more often and within a year the temple pads started to come apart, no biggy I thought until the nose piece tore. I called Bolle and they replace them with a new pair. With another year the Horn pair did the same thing. I called Bolle again, but i was out of warranty. The Lady I talked with said that she would send out another pair, and did, but these were not polorized. The black are holding up better, but I am starting to see signs of temple pad wear. I have looked for replace nose pads for Fangs, but have not been able to find them."
2,cheap quality,"Bought these and a pair of Ray Ban 4115...both glasses for small-medium faces. The Bolles were cheap and made in China...maybe a coincidence. Ray Bans were made in Italy by Luxottica. The Bolles were eceived defective with the logo on the side of the glasses disconnected and lying in the case. Bolles were shiny plastic while the RBs were matte black strong nylon type plastic fram. Bolles were ""polarized"" but I couldn't tell. The RB's weren't polarized but clearly had higher quality lenses. RBs were $63 and the Bolles were $56...keeping the RBs returning the Bolles."
2,Tiny sunglasses,"Don't purchase these sunglasses unless you are a tiny headed person. Or, perhaps in the alternative, you have an average sized head and you want your cranium to look impossibly gigantic."
4,Pretty Good,"I picked up this Cd for the single ""O"" which I love, but never was a B2K fan but its a pretty good CD!"
3,Looks Vs. Singing?,"This CD is kinda funny to me. I like the songs but its just..He can't sing...I mean really it would of been perfect for someone who has some actual vocal skills..He sounds just as whiney as his brother..You may listen to this cd for the first 1 or 2 weeks..But after that..It will probably annoy you..He actually has way too many slow songs...He is not built like that..Also..Why does everyone elaborate on how pretty this boi is? I mean does that have anything to do with his talent...I don't care if he is ugly, all i want is some good music...He should stick to more fast tracks and less demanding songs. 3 stars for an impressive solo cd, I actually expected this from him..I never thought he could sing in the first place.."
2,"""OK"" Debut......","I had no idea when I purchased this CD that he was in the group B2K, since I was never a fan of them. I think that will probably work against him here on this CD.With the whole B2K thing aside it is an ""ok"" CD. Nothing spectacualar on here to speak of. Filled with slow jams about love and trying to get a girl or get some booty. Kind of something that seems to be WAY too repetitive for newly solo R&B; artists (male) these days. It's not a stand out style by any means. I was hoping for a little more upbeat/clubbin' tracks but, again, mostly all slow jams. They are mediocre at best. He has a decent voice but nothing to pine over. I think this is a CD geared more towards the ladies.The 2 tracks that I feel standout here are: ""O"" and the club bumper: ""Drop That Heater""Other than that it does not have too much originality to it."
2,"very good, but.....","this is actually very good for his first shot at being solo. i really do like the album, but i hate about 3-4 songs and i cant stand that just because he in his 20's now he has to act like his so grown. youre just 20 years old omarion slow down with the sex songs, there are other things in life besides sex that teens and young adults are going through. and if sex is the only thing on your mind, then you must have a really great sexlife to constantly be singing about it."
1,GARBAGE!!!,"Why? All I can ask is why! I tried to listen to this album but I couldn't even get all the way through it. I just started screaming. The only decent song on this CD is ""O"" the title song. Come on Omarion...I'm sure u got more talent than that. Then again....maybe you dont."
3,jerome,does anyone know what happended to before dark and tg4 i know like omarion was in before dark video baby and monica tg4 was in b2ks video why i love you davida is sexy whoooo child she will be 20 on august da 5 any way good cd fav song im tryna
1,Good singer! But Daul DVD/CD is not!,"I was very disappointed to hear the new dual DVD/CDSide A is recored as a CD track versionOther Side B is recored as the DVD versionThe songs are the same both side:Just side A is in 2.0 channelJust side B is in 5.1 channelI would give the album: 2/10 for Music on the DVD side.DO NOT BUY this, unless like me you are a fan.You will not benefit from anything such as better quality in music...Dual DVD/CD is just a waste of time and money, buy SACD or DVD-Audio or both.10 times better!Sorry fans, but trust me, unless you are after this for a collection set, it is not worth the money."
1,O'',"I this buy album hoping it was gonin'to be good cd but i shortly disappoint with buying this cd all the song sound the same there was one song like and that the single ""O"". this cd is horrendously please don't waste your money this. Mario is the best buy not this Omarion BS trust me don't waste your time and money u by sorry."
3,"Okay album, nothing special or unique","First off, I would like to state that I am not a B2K/Omarion fan--I do not have a bias to Omarion for any illogical reason. I listened to O, and I think the best part of the album is its dance-friendly beats (when the songs are not slow jams). Most of the rappers on this album are forgettable except for Big Boi on ""Never Gonna Let You Go"" (a song also on the Hitch soundtrack). The lyrics are atypical gotta-get-the-booty songs that, in some form or another, have been recorded by other male R&B singers. (The only exception is ""Growing Pains,"" a song recorded for the other three members of B2K about their breakup.) If you like TRL-friendly R&B, this album is for you, but if you're a serious R&B fan, pass up this album."
2,Come Here for the truth,"This is not Jospeh i am his youngest daughter, and this is what i think about this CDMost girls like omarion for his good looks and don't evenn look past that to see how disgusting this stuff is. Before i tell you about this Cd let me say that i actually enjoy touch and o only for their beats and omarion sounds good in o touch vocals could be better. Let's begin nowOmarion is another singer that doesn't get enough sex, well at least in his songs. I believe that since mostly women like him he needs to sing us females something better than take it off, turn off the lights, i want to hear you scream my name, etc. Not that we want him to become gay so he can help us through problems but something a little more gentle than sex. But it is what most fans want to hear, but there are still some of us left that you haven't pleased yet.Sorry Omarion but can we get something more meaningful."
5,OUR HOUSE,"THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE ITS ABOUT CARING LOVING AND GIVING SOMEONE A CHANCE IN LIFE IT JUST GREAT ,,,,"
5,Deserves 10 stars!,"This is a superlative movie that should be made available on DVD as soon as possible. Doris Roberts gives a top performance, as do all the supporting cast."
4,Our House,"I just wanted to increase the number of reviews on this movie. I loved it. If it's possible that the phrase 'heart-warming' can be used too much, this movie presses the boundary! If ever you need a good cry, and I'm RARELY eager to accept such an invitation, I recommend it. But rest assured that you'll smile boat loads before the cry comes, and you will end the movie with a smile on your face, and heart.The ONLY reason I give this movie 4 stars , instead of 5, is that it's a little irritating that the homeless people are so cheerful. From our first encounters with them, most are almost euphorically merry; which is a bit improbable. However, this is a Larry Levinson film, which are meant to raise the spirit and leave you with a feeling of well-being, and this movie does accomplish that. So you should be able to overlook the flaws and appreciate the movie for what it is: inspiring."
2,Title Doesn't Describe Content,"""Losing Your Pounds of Pain Breaking the Link Between Abuse, Stress, and Overeating"" isn't the best title for this book. In fact, the description on the back reading, ""...wonderful book that will truly help you break the damaging connection between emotional pain and overeating..."" isn't really accurate either. The truth is that too much of the content focuses on sexual abuse. There's paragraph after paragraph about various folks being abused. I hadn't interpreted the title in that way and thought that my stress = overeating cycle would be addressed more completely.There is one page of affirmations and a short section that correlates some common foods to their associated emotional/personality traits, which was helpful. Other than that I was thoroughly disappointed."
4,An insightful book about compulsive eating and pain,"Doreen virtue shows us in her lovely book ""Losing Your Pounds of Pain"", that there is a connection between emotional pain and overeating.This book has been a gem in supporting me in overcoming my emotional issues that have kept me locked in a place where I never thought I could overcome my problems with food and weight.There are lengthy chapters about sexual abuse, that do get a little detailed, but she also talks about the pain of this moment and other childhood issues that may cause you to over eat.I really enjoyed the last several chapters that are solution oriented, and have helped me tremendously on my journey. I would highly recommend this book."
4,My thoughts,"This book is a hit & miss but the content is extrodinary. I find myself always wanting more even when it becomes a slow read. I am on my own mission to heal myself & lose those unwanted pounds - even the ones I am hanging onto because of the pain that comes with them. I would say ""YES - GO BUY IT!"
1,Not worth the time -,"This book is New Age fluff - not worth the time it took to read it. Has no practical or innovative approach to offer. Author indicates you need to deal with all your life issues before you can lose weight. If that's the case, no one will ever lose weight. Better off spending your time reading ""Overcoming Overeating"" - a gem of a book written in 1988 - find it on Amazon for less than ( ). Absolutely novel concept - it's working for me. Approach with an open mind and commitment. OA veterans will find ""Overcoming Overeating"" scarey - it preaches liberation, not a lifetime of reinforcing ""I'm a compulsive overeater."" It's a cure - not an excuse or a prison. Try it."
4,A delightful travel narrative,"Kisor clearly enjoys train travel, and while he loves trains he wisely refrains from burying the reader in the sort of minutia that rail buffs feed on. Seldom does the story drag.The style is open and friendly, and it's clear that Kisor has respect and affection for the staff and passangers he meets on the train.The narrative style reminds me a little of John McPhee; Kisor has the same talent for fading into the background and letting the story tell itself."
1,Awful Tests,"The tests in here are all poorly worded and the logic behind them is nothing like the real SAT questions. They will be very nitpicky about certain details unlike the actual. My scores on other practice tests were all around 680-750, while my scores on these tests we about 480. There isn't even a scoring guide provided! Stick with some other book, please"
1,"WARNING! censored ""family"" versions...","BEWARE! these are the heavily ""sanitized"" versions with no extras. Wait for the MGM versions--they are intact"
5,A must for self-sustaining kitchen,"I had to reorder this book, as I lent mine out and it didn't come back. ;-( This is a must-have supplement to your Ball Canning book, not just for canning, but prep and drying foodstuffs as well. Everything from jerky to fruit leather is found in this book, and there is a healthy emphasis on food safety throughout.For the new person in the kitchen, it's easy to read, and you will be confident in setting out to begin your own food preservation."
2,Not completely satisifed,"I purchased this book for someone as a gift, I have the book myself and love it. The book was advertised as new, when I received the book, the book appears to be new, but when I opened the cover it is inscribed as a gift from someone to someone else. Not what I ordered! Not happy at all. Delivery time was excellent, very fast."
4,putting food by,"This is my favorite canning, jelly and preserve book. I ordered one for my son for Christmas, and it was well-received. Thanks!"
3,"Great for some, not others","Absolutely excellent and comprehensive, but if you're new to canning--a city girl like me or simply afraid of killing someone with your canned goods--start with something less scary."
4,Wish it had more recipes,Great book that provides a lot of inforamtion about the processes of putting food by. I learned a lot and have a much better understanding of how to properly can and freeze various foods. My only wish is that it had more actual recipes. I ended up going back online to find a good tomato pickling recipe since I couldn't find any in this book.
1,a waste of your money,"The title is more grand than the projects. If you are an experienced crocheter, this book is a disappointment, to put it lightly. I could imagine that perhaps children aged 8-10 yrs would find these projects appropriate to their skills in crocheting, otherwise the designs are just dull and unpleasant. I am truly very sorry to say this, but this book is a waste of money."
1,Victorian Crocheted Christmas Ornaments: 33 Quick-And-Easy Projects,"Most of the patterns in the book are juvenile. There are a few (perhaps 5 or 6) that can be salvaged, if you know how to crochet. I am not an expert, but this author is not even a beginner. Apparently none of the simple (very simple) designs are starched or stiffened, and the patterns are way too simple, and frankly, lackluster. P.S. to the author...if you're a ten-year-old girl, your work is fantastic! (Truly...you just have more to learn.) If you're an adult, well, just take some more crochet classes."
3,Can you handle the truth?,"First came their 1992 album ""The Naked Truth"" (70:10), an ""unplugged"" collection. In 1998, the album was re-released in Austria with a bonus disc (26:56) of 7 more performances, appropriately renamed ""The Complete Naked Truth"".This second re-issue, titled ""Fully Naked"", comprises these 2 discs, plus a 3rd disc (30:19) ""From The Vaults"", all nicely packaged in a digipak. This disc contains 7 more live performances, plus the studio leftover ""Madame Zou Zou"". 3 tracks from the disc appear on the 4-disc compilation ""The Devil Made Us Do It"".The recording quality of these live performances is excellent, and hearing the material in an ""unplugged"" fashion makes for an interesting change.If you've missed out on picking up the first 2 releases, go straight for this 3-disc edition."
5,Excellent Introduction to .NET CAS model,"Should be required reading for all .NET developers, both C# and VB.NET. Chapters 5 & 6 are strong, with some good lessons on leveraging the .NET security framework and overall secure coding techniques."
5,Best Missionary biography I have ever read.,This book will do more to challange you than any biography I have read. It will highten your concern for lost souls and make you consider what you are doing with the life God has given you.
5,Convicting,If you read this you will be convicted of your lack of commitment & wonder how one man could remain so uninfluenced by what culture expects us to be taken in by. This man is a rock for Jesus and we need his inspiration badly. Read it because it will change you.
2,One man's vibrant is another man's quavering,"Tommy Makem is an institution in Irish folk music. He has been playing banjo and singing for many many many years. His early work (1955-1962) with the Clancy Brothers is a delight. Heck, I enjoyed his 1997 memoir/travelogue, ""Tommy Makem's Secret Ireland"". His book, along with a stellar review, convinced me to buy this album.Well, the music is beautifully arranged, and the instrumentals show real musicianship throughout. However, I'm no fan of vibrato, and frankly, the artist's voice seems so weak. It quavers in every single song. Maybe this is intentional, maybe not. Bottom line: Makem sounds like he's in his early 80s.Now that I've opened the jewel box, I can't return it to Amazon.com so I'll have to see what I can get for it at the used CD store. Please please please don't buy this album - Makem is a wonderful musician and has many other releases which must sound better."
3,JUST OK,The product what great it was just the rate it got here that was AWFUL! I ordered this book on June 30th and I didn't recieve it until July 23rd. About 5 days after I ordered the product the seller sent me an e mail telling me she wouldn't be able to send it till July 16th- 18th because she was out of town. I ordered this book early so I could have it for a class I'm taking. The class is now half way over and I just got my book today because she didn't send it till the 20th. Personally if you know your not going to be able to send it then why even put it up to sell. I don't recommend buying from the seller kim-books! Thanks
5,Tramping into the Nixon White House,"This wonderful book grows from the photos of Dealy Plaza tramps on captured Nov. 22, '63. Author Weberman had a website under the name of the book and it was so 'dangerous' that the FBI arrested him for possession of marijuana with intent to sell and his marvelous website melted away--that's how 'deadly' this book is! Some of the very shooters are pictured and documented and yet NO record of their arrest or interrogation in Dallas PD custody is left--Duh! Nixon may be implied merely as a dupe by deep-CIA machinations, but the Nixon/Watergate tapes do reveal the burglaries were really about the assassin's blow-back control, not political bungling. This is the best book yet I've read about the assassination, and if anyone cares about truth and history, and our present situation, this book is a must read!"
5,best on the market,These are the best on the market.Their stand is as sturdy as are the tools.I like the ergonomics.
5,Solid!,"I have needing something like these for a long time and finally purchased them, and really enjoy using them for all my tinkering. Solid build and very stable to use with the plastic coated handles that give you a really nice grip on the tool. So much better than those tiny ""L"" shaped allen wrenches. I tossed all of those away now that I have these."
2,"Brother, Where Are You?","This offbeat and risky movie tries to create some food for though about the construction of identity, siblings` connection, alter egos, duality, reality vs illusion and so on. David Cronenberg is a director that dares to take risks, but in this movie the interesting concept is wasted by the average and not too surprising or engaging execution. Jeremy Irons is indeed excellent as the two twins and manages to perform two very distinct individuals with similar looks, yet ""Dead Ringers"" is slow paced, somewhat predictable and runs out of steam by the middle, culminating in an unsatisfying ending. This just seems like underdeveloped material with a couple of good moments. It`s also a too dry and cold movie, which makes for a somewhat distant cinematic experience, despite the solid acting, directing and score. Still a mildly interesting effort nonetheless, but not a very compelling or memmorable one.Worth a look yet far from a must-see."
2,Not Jeremy Irons best work,I watched a documentary on great film on IFC and this was on the list. i think they were smoking crack when they put this movie in it. Completely boring and the chick who plays the lead is so not hot. Just plain weird.
4,Delightfully creepy,"Although a little slow at times, this film never once ceases to fill the viewer with a vague sense of unease. The co-dependency of Elliot and Beverly is made frighteningly real by the surrealististic overtones injected into the mundanity.The cinematography and set design complement each other wonderfully, with gloomy, unreal overtones occasionally shot through with brilliant shafts of light.This is a wonderful use of a night. I wouldn't claim it to be Iron's best work, but it does rank up there. It is certainly more captivating than *Damage*, but not as hypnotizing as *Lolita*."
4,THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE WANT,"I can't help the fact that this film has a really depressive atmosphere but, i must say, a very intersting one. And isn't that what we exactly want in a Cronenberg film ?"
4,Jeremy Irons does more than just clone himself in this role!,"The Mantle brothers, Beverly and Elliot, are more than just identical twins. They're like two aspects of one person's internal character turned into two separate external realities. They're both brilliant gynecologists specializing in infertility problems with women and have spent their whole lives living as if they were one individual. They live in the same flat, work at the same clinic and share the same unsuspecting women until Beverly falls in love and no longer wants to share. This emotional break initiates an evaluation of the self, ultimately calling into question the very nature of the brothers symbiotic relations. Can they survive without each other? Jeremy Irons does more than just clone himself in this role, but engenders the brothers Mantle with two distinctive characterizations that are convincing and compelling. Based on an actual case."
4,Jeremy Irons is magnificent!,"I remember the trailers for this film. The film company promoted this movie like it was a horror film. Yes, David Cronenberg made successful horror films like ""The Brood"", ""Scanners"" and of course, ""The Fly"". But they clearly missed the boat on this movie. This is an effective drama on the lives of identical twins and how their reactions (alcohol, drugs, relationships, etc.) coinside with each other. I thought Jeremy Irons was outstanding in this film. He captures the essence of both of the doomed twins. He would later recieve an Academy Award. Genevive Bujold gives an effective performance as Claudia. Overall, this is a moving and powerful film study.(Note - Be on the lookout for Jill Hennessy and her twin sister, Jacqueline in their first roles.)"
3,Not quite complete,"I saw this movie when it first came out.....and was DISAPPOINTED that it did NOT follow the book....which was ghastly and almost stomach-turning. The film, tho good, did not capture the horrible reality of these two men's existence....particularly toward the end. Read the book. You will know what I mean. As an addaption, it is excellent, and there is no doubt that Jermy Irons was great. Perhaps the director felt there were things in the book which he could not show.....understandable. Read the book. You will be shocked far beyond what the film shows. Please don't misunderstand. The film is great. But NOT as good as the real story in the real book."
4,very creepy and disturbing movie,"This movie would have been nothing if not for the effective, nuanced acting skills of Jeremy Irons. He so convincingly portrays twin doctors (one sick, the other a whole lot sicker) that it brings an incredible life to this cerebral movie. It makes you really think about who a surgeoen is before he puts you to sleep an cuts you open. Like ""The Shining"", this movie improves with repeated viewings.I'm a man. This movie should creep out women a lot more than men"
3,Film owes everything to Iron's riveting performance.,"This film is essentially about two things, the downward spiral into madness and the special bond between twin brothers. Some parts of this film were slow and not quite believable. Overall, though, it was pretty well done. There are a few good laughs, in particular when Irons has a middle-aged lady in the stirrups; watch for that scene. Irons is absolutely fascinating and convincingly portrays two look-alikes with different personalities/habits. Worth watching just to see Irons' flawless performance of the twisted brothers."
2,o.k. movie - little disappointing.,"With all the rave reviews, i thought this movie would be be much better. don't get me wrong the acting and concept is superb...but the actual movie was slow and drawn out. For being ""in the top ten, all-time shocking movies"" it was frankly not shocking. I love the criterion collection but I was dissappointed just for the simple fact there were no sub-titles. This is such a basic feature I couldn't believe it wasn't included. Lastly, the picture is average transfer. there are blemishes that are noticable through out the movie. My [less expensive] movies have better quality (same time frame)!!! I guess it just wasn't my cup of tea. (by the way - the seventh seal - is the bench mark of criterion in my opinion."
2,"SLICK, MANIPULATIVE....","David Cronenberg's imagination is filled with images of dread, horror and grotesquerie. This film is infinitely hypnotic, but it is also depraved and repulsive. Jeremy Irons, as identical twin psycho-sexually manic gynocologists (yup, you read that right), is, as usual, wonderfully subtle and creepy, and the real trick is that he gives each character a distinctive personality without changing a whit of his mannered voice and look. The story descends into a maddening depressive, inevitably repugnant vision of obsession, and along the way is littered with some of the most graphically disturing dream sequences put on film since Cronenberg's own squeamishly hideous The Brood."
1,Buy the Warner Brother's edition!,"Yes, the edition I'm reviewing is a Criterion release, but you should not take that to mean that the sound quality of this disc is even acceptable. I'd earlier bought Anchor Bay's version of the disc, had found it unacceptable, and hoped, rather felt sure, that Criterion's would be better. Well, the Anchor Bay logo appears onscreen at the start of Criterion's disc! Does this mean that Criterion didn't bother to remaster the film? Ay carumba!!The loss of sound fidelity is especially noticable in Howard Shore's gorgeous score. The disc extras are interesting but are no substitute for competently mastered picture and sound, the meat and potatoes of any disc. ""Boooo!"" to Criterion on this one!"
1,Brand new but with flaws?,"Shipping was no problem. DVD was shrink wrapped, an indication that it was brand new.However, when played it kept freezing up at certain spots of the movie...and throughout the duration of the movie.I couldn't scan past these spots either. It would freeze up the DVD player and would only work if I rebooted the player and then used scene selection to resume play after the glitched spot. This caused me to miss certain parts of the film. Lame.It did the same thing at the same spots on different players.Factory defect, I guess since the play surface was scratch-free and had no visible blemishes.I'm in the process of returning it to the seller."
4,"A change from David Cronenberg's usual fare, still great","The Mantle Brothers are star surgeons, specializing in gynaecological disorders. They're also identical twins, two halves of one person. Together, they are a brilliant doctor. Apart, they are doomed. When a woman enters Beverley's life, drawing him away from his twin, their lives begin to deterioriate. David Cronenberg explores the identity of the individual and the twin in this horror-thriller that represents somewhat of a deviation from his usual style, with more drama and less of the physical grotesque. But the Mantle boys are monstrous, and that will be their downfall."
5,"Inspired by love, nature, spirituality and healing beliefs","""Warm Embrace"" features the work of music producer, keyboardist, and fourth generation gospel minister James E. Wall. This impressive collection of gentle instrumental music is ideal listening for those seeking music that will enhance their relaxation, healing, and inspired awareness. Inspired by love, nature, spirituality and healing beliefs, the ten pieces comprising this remarkable and flawlessly recorded recording include Loving Care (3:10); Healing Touch (5:50); Morning Sunrise (5:24); Love Affair (4:51); Desert Sunset (4:35); Cool Waters (5:20); Soul Refresher (5:14); Peace (4:41); Paradise (5:50); and the title piece, Warm Embrace (5:16). Soothing, melodic, lyrical, therapeutic for the mind and the soul, ""Warm Embrace is enthusiastically recommended listening -- especially for those harried and stressed out by life's many challenges and issues."

1,This is not a full version,"This soap opera is wonderfull, but unfortunatelly the DVD is not a full version. In my opinion, the customers would prefer to pay a little more to have a full version than to buy a DVD and discover lately, that there are completed cut out scenes that are very important to understand the story. It is a pitty. Before watching the DVDs, I was about to buy the other soap operas but I won't do it anymore."
5,Pasion,"The story is great and the quality of the film is fantastic. The performance of the actors, the background scenes, the clothing: everything is excellent and very well reproduced. Recommended very highly"
2,Not what I expected-disappointed,Disappointed because the Novela is incomplete. Most of the important parts of the story are cut and it is not worth the money. I Love telenovelas and would pay more if the version were complete. Do not recommend the purchase.
5,Telenovela Review,"I thought it was great, I had not seen the orginal so the fact that it did not show all the episodes did not bother me as much as others I have purchased and than found a lot of the important scences missing. But I strongly recommended this telenovela I really enjoyed it and the price was great. If you are a Fernando Colunga fan you will enjoy this telenovela."
4,Very reliable company,"When I needed to exchange an item, I got excellent treatment. I would order from them again."
2,"good guitarist, crappy album","The majority of the tracks on this album are in-your-face, toneless, distortion crap (psuedo early Sammy Haagar). There are also few decent 12-string acoustic numbers, however, all 3 of them sound like the same song. The only 2 songs maybe worth even borrowing this wretched album for are the collaborations with Steve Morse and Allan Holdsworth. Waste of money."
4,Dubby freaky stuff,"A great cd if you're into getting into another zone, motionless on your couch, eyes closed, convincing yourself that there IS a Matrix and you're in it!"
3,Many kinases are covered with this book??,"As you may guess, this book is kind of revised edition published ""Protein Kinase"" in 1994. Only two authors are invited to contribute again but their articles look like similar old one. Something new about protein kinase in this book is like Jak/STAT, SOCS, MAPK and something like that. Cell signaling is one of the extensive research fields nowadays. Unfortunately, this book is not good enough to cover many areas in the signal transduction. I think it would be good idea to publsih this book a series journal such as ""Annual Reivews"" in order to keep updating results."
2,Too Itchy,"I got the Snoogle Deluxe because the cover is supposedly 100% cotton. But boy, is it itchy. I am sending it back because I couldn't get used to the fabric and have decided to try the Boppy.Also, I feel that the pillow is a little too stiff for my liking. I woke up with shoulder and back pain."
3,Colloquial Russian,"The book would have been great, but for one very annoying fact. Often the text is stuck together. You will get two, possibly three Russian words stuck together with no space between them. This is the case with the kindle version. I don't know how Amazon can sell a product with such an elementary error."
3,Not sure about this book,"I'm not sure how to rate this book. It had some good moments. I like the characters and I like the way Ms. Miles dips into her period. The setting is New England (Bracebridge) in the spring of 1764. In the book we see the earlier attempts at innoculating against small pox. We also see murder and mayhem in this little New England town.Charlotte Willett knows in her heart that when one of the young girls in quarantine for a small pox vaccination dies, it's murder, but she appears to be the only one that thinks so. She must investigate further and discovers an old love story that is at the root of the problem. I found the plot predictable, and there wasn't that much suspense to my mind. In truth, I had trouble getting through the book. I will read the rest of the series because I like Ms. Miles writing and especially her character portrayals."
1,very unhappy,im very sad that this item came open but the outside of the box was seal but the box inside was open and the watch wasn't package right im very unhappy about this ....
1,hmm...,"i dont personaly own this, but i seen it at a store in york or something.....it looks stupid,the guy at the counter said something interesting about itso that i might buy it.but i knew better. you should stay with the other playstaion playable thingys...or Bleem."
4,Treatment Approaches for an Evolving Field.,"Lundrigan has written a well reasoned, utilitarian and user friendly treatment guide for working with a heterogeneous population. Past approaches too heavily relied on a ""one-size fits all"" approach whose efficacy can be debated. Experienced clinicians with a good foundation in theory and practice will find this to be a helpful guide to working effectively with this underserved population. Additional materials and indexes were also well done and helpful."
2,Parting the Veil,"I just finished reading ""Parting of the Veil"" but it wasn't a good read. I was very disappointed in it. It wasn't worth the time to read the 400 pages and it was SLOW. Thing is, I didn't agree with a big part of it. A guy murders his daughter, wife and a family friend (who had had the out of body experience). The father then committed suicide and the only survivor was his little son. The angel says that they all completed their mission. God sent them to earth to teach the little boy some valuable lessons he will need later in life. (It took 400 pages to say that too.) Anyway, I DON'T AGREE! That abusive father is responsible for his actions. He could have been a loving father but instead he turned on his family and murdered them. I don't think that murdering the family was his mission at all! I think the book review was very misleading. I wonder if the reviewer that recommended the book even read it."
2,Stick with volume one!!,"Although the show is from the same night as volume one,it just doesnt floor you as the chops-fest that Vol.one is.You get the feeling that these were leftover songs that werent good enough for the first volume.Dont get me wrong Paul and Bruce still put most guitar players in other bands to shame,but it just didnt do it for me in terms of what I always listened to Racer X for!!!Long Live Shred Guitar"
1,Regurgitated Self-loathing Diatribe,"This book was a disappointment not only in its poor writing style, but all in the fact that it does not break any new ground. It is little more than a string of regurgitated self-loathing diatribes written to target an already pre-defined and well-established group of readers who scoop books up like this so that they can cite secondary sources to justify their world view. Rather than taking a balanced approach with each of the topics they addressed, these authors rush to a conclusion unsubstantiated either in fact or analysis and little true ""discovery"" is ever made.I have much more respect for authors who seek to do some spade work in uncovering a new point of view, balanced and justified with deductive reasoning, not recitations of pre-packaged pabulum already in circulation in dog eared white papers written by disenfranchised college professors.Fortunately, I bought this book used and my personal loss, other than the time I spent reading it, was minimized.Bytes"
4,Favorite Dub Syndicate,"This is my favorite Dub Syndicate release: I own a couple. This CD is some of the ""newer"" dub that I first heard back in the mid 90's. I'm not sure what one of the previous reviewers was talking about when they mentioned levels fluctuations, because I heard this for the first time cranked over a newly installed theater sound system during a system check by the tech's and it sounded great!I'm a fan of Augustus Pablo, King Tubby and Lee ""Scratch"" Perry and the Syndicate does sounds different. Not a lot of horns and definitely a more synthesized sound, but I have to agree ""no lack of rhythm and groove""."
2,Not so great Techno-Dub,"Yes, this cd contains some spacey stereo effects. But, overall this is a poorly put together piece. The sound levels fluctuate, the stereo washes are inaccurate, the musicianship is minimal. Buy the cheapest used copy you can find if you must buy this cd."
3,Takes way too long to come to a conclusion,"While I enjoyed this book, I have to say that at a certain point, I just wanted to get it over with and almost didn't care any more who the culprit was. I also wasn't totally satisfied with the conclusion once I got there. Before I pick up the next mystery in this series, I will have to make sure it's under 300 pages. These mysteries do not warrant any length, because once it gets to a certain point, it just drones on and on."
2,SO MANY BETTER CD'S IN THIS GENRE,"Once again bought this on the strength of some reviews in guitar player magazine. Wish I hadn't. James Byrd can certainly play the guitar fast. If speed is the only thing you're looking for, than this is not too bad. If you also like some worthwhile compositions, forget it. If you like an original tone and some original ideas while playing the guitar, forget it. This is cliche metal at it's worst. The ""COMPOSITIONS????"" don't even work as framework for solos. Speaking of solos, they are poor at best and never reach any highlights or memorable moments. There is also the almost obligatory accoustic/spanish guitar bit that is meant to add variety to the musik, all it does is show that James can't play accoustic to save his live. I shall certainly make this my one and only BYRD CD."
4,Lots of good information,"Cichlids are a fascinating family of fishes, with high intelligence and complex behaviors. Robert Goldstein has written a solid introduction to keeping and breeding a wide variety of these fascinating species.Even though it is an introduction, however, it is not a beginner-level book. Much of the material is presented in a way that assumes more knowledge of aquaria than most beginners would have.If you like cichlids, though (Discus, freshwater Angelfish, Oscars, Mbuna to name a *very* few,) you would enjoy this book as a supplement to other materials."
5,I love Home At Last!,"This is a really a great album. I saw the video on the Disney channel and had already fallen in love with Ready, Set, Don't go and then heard The Beginning and fell in love with that one and it just kept going. I really hope he can get some air play with radio and video channels this time. His last album, Wanna Be Your Joe was equally good but couldn't get any air or video play in the US. I hope Billy Ray gets the recognition he deserves with this album. I would love to see him at the top of the charts again."
5,Awesome CD,"This is Billy Ray Cyrus like you have never heard him before. He has mellowed and his voice is beautiful on these heartfelt songs. Some new original songs as well as some old favorites like ""Brown Eyed Girl"" that Billy Ray does an excellent job singing. Makes you want to go out and see him live on his tour this fall. This is a must have cd for your collection."
1,regret,"The ONLY song I have heard from Billy Ray that I even remotely like is Ready, Set, Don't Go as a DUET with Miley . I bought the cd thinking this song was on there, but NO it is only Billy singing the song solo and it is horrible without Miley. They should have noted that SOMEWHERE before I bought it and I never would have (maybe the point???)"
2,Edgless,Knive kept an edge for almost a day had it professionally sharpen two days later barely last for week. Very disappointed would return if I could doesnot with stand pro use
4,Sea foam,"Don't have any prove but have heard from many that it really works great, especially for built up gum in small engine carbs.Excellent shipping and service"
4,"Smooth, right, like what your lookin for in Female blues","Heard it first on Direct TV, Blues music channel., check that out!....This woman can deliver a blues tune like you would think more women would have figured out how to do by now."
2,A letdown (speaking as a longtime fan),"Ditching her road band and signing with a new label, new mom Sue tries to go for the serious signer-songwriter route. It does not work-- the lyrics are sketchy Dylanish ramblings, and the music is not strong. My advice is to opt for her superior albums on the Antone's label instead."
5,Soldiers,"I had a friend who fought in the Americal Division in Vietnam. His wife died before the year 2000, and he spent the night with us after the funeral. I played Phil Driscoll's ""Soldiers"" for him then. It toutched him so deeply that he asked me to play it for him over and over again. This song fingered God's relationship with him through all the very dificult times of his life, including this one. Thank you, Mr. Driscoll."
5,Absolutely one of his best!,"Fantastic music. If you're not a Phil Driscoll fan, this one will most assuredly do it. The live recordings will make you sing out loud and shout for joy!"
3,Jamesian ghost story,An excellent novel length horror story in the mode of M.R. James. The book itself deserves at least four stars but the kindle version has many jarring spelling errors that affect the readability.
4,Pseudonym of Neil McMahon,"According to a Wikipedia entry, Daniel Rhodes was a pseudonym of Neil McMahon. As Daniel Rhodes, he wrote three horror stories which were reissued in 2011 as ebooks. After that, he has 7 other published novels including a collaboration with James Patterson, so if you like his work in this book, check out his other books!"
3,"One or the other, but not both","If you have ""Writing the Breakout Novel,"" you don't really need the workbook. If you don't, this might be enough. It condenses ""Writing the Breakout Novel."" Each chapter deals with a topic (such as Exposition or Characterization) with some ""workbook"" pages at the end of each. The workbook exercises are basically questions with blanks (as opposed to charts or tables), which could just as easily be accommodated at the end of any book.You certainly don't need both books. In either case, neither book will take you from idea to finished product. More accurately, both expect that you at least already have a work-in-progress, so an accurate title would be ""REVISING the Breakout Novel.""I bought both books and I would suggest only one or the other. If you want some in-depth on topics, buy the book. If you want just the essence and a few questions for thought, buy the workbook."
4,"FINISHED, OR WRITING IN PROGRESS?","Maass' workbook is terrific. My only problem while using it was that Maass intended for it to serve both as a companion piece as you write your novel, or as a workbook afterward. That makes it difficult at times. He asks questions that require you to be far along in your book, yet the whole purpose of the book is to ratchet up your novel to break out level. Still, after years of writing, and having read tons of writing books, I think his is one of the best. It does require you make your own way, it is not paint by numbers. The book does not do the heavy lifting for you. He says in the intro that you can do the exercises while writing. They require a lot of work, but in the end I do believe he is on to something, and I highly recommend the book."
4,A Helpful Addition,"This book is not just its companion volume in workbook form. This was written four years after publishing Writing The Breakout Novel, and after extensive workshop tours. You get the addition of all the exercises from his workshops. If you liked Writing The Breakout Novel, or if you're considering buying it, go ahead and add this volume to your cart. It is well worth the purchase.The only dissapointment I had in this book was that after many steps in the exercises, he orders us emphatically, in italics, to ""Write that down now. Write those down. Start writing now. Note them. Make notes. Note it now. Make notes, starting now.""He insults his reader by assuming that we are procrastinators who can't finish what we"
2,Beginners Only,"If you are just starting to think about writing and have not read any books on the subject, this one may be worthwhile. Otherwise, don't bother."
4,A good source for inspiration,"I previously purchased WRITING THE BREAKOUT NOVEL. The workbook was recommended by an instructor at the University of Wisconsin novel writing clinic in November. The guidance from both works is very good. The workbook provides specific suggestions for implementing the techniques of novel writing and is aimed at the writer who has completed at least a first draft of his work. The workbook is useful even if you haven't read the original work but I recommend both.I have read a number of 'how-to' books on fiction writing in general and novels in particular. For pure instruction with an entertaining style, these books by Donald Maass are the best."
5,"Makes you plan, think and plot","Excellent guide for writing a novel, whether your first, second, third, etc. Love the exercises. They really make you think! It's better than an advice book that talks to you; this one makes you work hard. Only good things come from hard work."
5,A great guide,This is a great gide to writing a book. I was stuck writing my novel and needed a few pointers to help me along. I found a wealth of information in this book to use. I also go the workbook to use with it. I like having a reference to make sure my novel has all it needs to be a success.
5,"A workbook, it is.","Not for the faint of heart, yet it does help you get through the walls. I found this book a very useful tool for any writer's shelf."
4,Almost What I Was Looking For,"I liked Writing the Breakout Novel Workbook very much. It was interesting and engaging, and helped me develop my story's characters. It taught me how to keep my reader engaged and how to properly start my novel. However, the book is more for someone who had their novel written before hand. This was frustrating at times when I was trying to do the exercises."
2,"No sir, I don't like it",Skrew was on a steady decline after their glorious debut. Shadow of Doubt and Angel Seed are not even worth owning. Just boring and uninspired. The ONLY song worth owning on here is 'Sam I Am'. I was very disappointed in the direction they went. Buy 'Burning in Water' and 'Dusted' and then move on to some other industrial metal such as 16 Volt.
4,another industrial-metal hellsphere from A. Grossman & Co.,"The third release from the man who brought you 1992's industrial-metal masterpiece, ""Burning In Water, Drowning In Flame"", this album is a must for the fans. The guitar is a bit overdosed this time around, but it has some of the coolest backing electronics I have ever heard (ex. the electro back build in ""Black Eye""). The vocals are also much less distorted than on previous releases, but lyrically just as twisted, and the drums just thunder and devastate. If you're into Ministry, Godflesh, KMFDM, Chainsaws.And.Children, Rammstein, Static-X, etc etc...this is a definite record to invest in."

3,Good Plot Idea But ...,Backdrop for story in post WWII Texas is intriguing as is basic plot but story becomes too predictable & the characters are caricatures. The result is a below-average page turner.
4,A strong debut with great promise,"The Rogue's Game is a hell of a ride through post WWII Texas. It's got a great poker game seemingly at the heart of it, until you realize that poker is just a means to an end.Burton's characterizations are quite unique, and drip with the flavor of West Texas. His sense of the slang, and character nicknames are very appealing. If you like movies like The Sting, anything to do with poker, noir novel, or sharp local dialog like almost no one writes today, run to get this book and make sure to check out his second book, The Sweet and the Dead, which is a true five star read. We can only home that Milton Burton is going to be with us for a very long time. This is one hell of an entertaining read."
3,Barbie does Egypt,"True to the formula of a historical romance, this book skimms through history with extensive detail on clothing, furnishings, intrigue and romance. The historic part comes in last. A delightful and mindless read, good for a long plane ride or a summer at the beach with the kids."
5,Awesome!,"I loved every page of this book. This book brings life to the story we all know and love. The characters are brought to life and for the first time, we see Cleopatra in a different light. She is not portrayed as the evil seductress that Roman history would have had us believe. As you read this book, you think, ""A woman whose possesses the intellegence that Cleopatra did would have not resorted to some of the things history has suggested to us.""George's knowledge of ancient Egypt and their customs is amazing. I know she did a lot of research for this book, but the detail in this book is incredible. I mean, you can picture what ancient Alexandria must have looked like. You can picture what all the characters must have looked like.Great book! I highly recommend it!"
5,"Finally, Cleo's Diary!","I confess I'm something of a nut when it comes to Ancient Egyptian anything, so when I bought this novel by Ms. George, I could hardly wait to read it. It fulfilled all my expectations and more. Cleopatra's sad story is well-known to any student of history, so the story won't have any surprises far as the better-known aspects of her life and death are concerned, but the language used to express Cleopatra is perfect, the setting as well. For the first time, you feel as if you really know this woman and her thoughts, as well as what her expectations of her two major loves were. Anyone who is an Egyptophile will love this book. I do."
4,Enjoying it,"I am thoroughly enjoying this long, long story. I just cannot agree with Mrs. George, that Cesar loved Cleopatra! If he did, he would have recognized her son by him and at least mentioned the child in his will. I do not believe Octavian had deceived Cesar. I actually believe Cesar being cut from the same cloth as Octavian, naturally made the young man his successor. Queen Cleopatra was raised in court among courtiers, without a mother, with a drunkard for father; I can't believe she was so nave as to think Cesar did really love her... She seems to have been a dreamer, but wouldn't the absence of her son from Cesar's will bring her back to reality?"
3,Interesting but...,"Margaret George's presentation of Cleopatra comes across very much as a historical romance rather than quasi biography. The depictions of Rome and Egypt are mesmerizing but she's excessive in her metaphors which detracts from the flow of the story. The book was a great read for amusement but the reader feels as if the writer is struggling too hard to be a classical writer. George's depiction of Cleopatra's character and personality was difficult at times to find believable. Here was a powerful ruler of Egypt that held the wealthiest country in her hands but she appeared throughout the story like any other pedestrian rather than a queen. In George's attempt to bring us closer to the human side of Cleopatra, she erased the actual power this woman must have held. Too much emotional portrayal and not enough intellect."
2,Tedious,"I'm fond of big novels but this one was a chore.After a thousand pages I still don't feel like I know, or care for, Cleopatra. How can that be?You would think it impossible to make her story a tedious one - but tedious it is. Banquet upon banquet, frivolity upon frivolity. Surely there was more to her than what she ate, what she wore and how she spent her country's money?The portrayal of Caesar was adequate, though not impressive. Marc Antony... who was he? The depiction of him is so thin he almost disappears.Not one character in a cast of hundreds manages to leave an impression.Very disappointing."
4,Unbelievable detail and a unique perspective,"The beginning of the book failed to capture my attention, but after I got through the first few pages, I adored it. It extremely interesting to hear about Cleopatra's affairs with men whom history has immortalized. (However, I was a little bit anxious to see Caesar die and discover how she got involved with Marc Antony.) Also, I was only familiar with accounts that referred to her as unattractive and homely, so this book's presentation of her was quite a surprise. Though the book tends to get a little fuzzy at times, it is full of color and life. George manages to make all the places alive again, even if her characters get somewhat flat. The detail that she goes into is at times surreal, the onyx floors, gem encrusted thrones, the jewelry, the doors with gold inlays, etc. Though the book is quite long (1,000 or so pages) it is most certainly worth your time."
3,LOOONG,I thoroughly enjoyed this book....until about page 650 or so. Way too long and drawn out. It could have been done in 5-6 hundred pages like Helen of Troy (which I also read and enjoyed very much). I love the history behind it. I would recommend the book with the advice to skim through ages 650 to about 850 or so. Antony's final battle is just too detailed.
5,A completely fascinating book!!!,"After having read Mary Queen of Scotland and the Isles by Ms. George, I was excited to find The Memoirs of Cleopatra; I was not disappointed! I love a book with colorful detail, and The Memoirs of Cleopatra is simply bursting with it! I also enjoyed the first person narrative - Cleopatra came across as intelligent, strong, beautiful, and oh so human. From history class, I knew how the story would end and dreaded it, having become so involved in Cleopatra's life - I have to confess I had to dry my eyes and blow my nose before I could read the final pages. Don't be daunted by the book's 1000 plus pages - I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a truly well written historical novel."
4,Amazing !!!!,"I really enjoyed reliving the history of Egypt through the eyes of Margaret George. The descriptions of the sites, sounds, and events of this era in history were so vivid that I felt like I was there. I couldn't put it down."
3,Audio narration...AGHHH!,"Just had to comment. The only reason I rated this so low, was not the book itself but the narration!!! The reader may have a 'sweet voice' but her mispronounciation! She read the name 'Pompey' as the town 'Pompei'. She mispronounced 'Lepidus'and even the title of 'tribune'. This just grated on my nerves! Shouldn't the narrator receive instructions and coaching if they are unfamiliar with certain names and words? The text is fine. Read it. Just don't listen to it!"
5,"Wonderful Book, a fantastic read","This book does an excellent job of vividly bringing Egypt and Cleopatra alive once again. Even it is over 900 pages, I wish it could have been longer. This is truly George's greatest novel. I would strongly recommend buying this book; it is definitely worth it."
4,Long but good,"This book certainly is not a quick read. However, I found it kept me entertained. The development of the character of Cleopatra is excellent. There are some sections that could be cut in length, but overall a very good book."
3,Good descriptions of the ancient world,"I have long had a fascination with the ancient world and watch every program on Egypt and Rome that is on TV. I found that this book is very descriptive about the palaces, clothes, jewelry, ceremonies, temples and battles of the ancient world. The author obviously did a lot of extensive research. It's a good book for someone who does not know a lot about the ancient world and would like to know more."
3,Cruelty to humans and animals,This was a fairly interesting book until I came to the part about the Roman cruelty to animals and people; and for the Romans' enjoyment !!!!! I couldn't force myself to finish reading it.
2,Disappointing,I have read all of Margaret George's books & this is the only one I haven't been crazy about. I don't know why but it was hard for me to get into it.
1,"Not like Henry the VIII or Mary, Queen of Scots","After reading Margaret George's The Autobiography of Henry VIII and Mary, Queen of Scots, I was eagerly awaiting her next book--assuming that it would be more British historical fiction. When I discovered The Memoirs of Cleopatra, I was a tad disappointed. Nevertheless, I happily bought the book assuming that it would be as interesting and fun to read as those other two.Boy, was I wrong! This tome was so horribly uninteresting, I was never able to finish it and it still sits only half-read on my bookshelves. Sometimes, I think of tackling it again, but everytime I read the first several pages, I wind up putting it back down."
3,Corporate Super-mom Cleopatra,"Read this book if you would like to see what Cleopatra would have been like if she had've been a modern corporate super-mom.While the story reads well and fluidly, Cleopatra is incongriously well informed for an ancient ruler and has a utopian court of dedicated people around her who all love her dearly. Ancient rulers would have been extremely jealous! She also has the benefit of historical hindsight as she is able to predict with certainty most future events that the likes of Antony are unable to.If all she wanted for her children was a stable Egypt and she was the only one to predict Octavian's treachery - why did she demand the additional lands from Antony when she would have certainly known that this would give him the ammunition he needed to destroy Antony in the eyes of the mob?Cleopatra was a canny poltican of her day, and at least equally as conniving as any of them. This book exonerates her completely and does so with some narrative clumsiness."
4,Thoroughly enjoyable and enlightening,"I loved reading this book because I love learning more about famous, or infamous, and mysterious people and the events. We can only speculate today on the events surrounding Cleopatra and her children and loves and politics. That's why I couldn't put it down. M. George really sets an atmosphere in her novels of the times and circumstances and implications going on at the time. Our lives can be enriched by the past and people of the past when we have the benefit of M. George's efforts. She explains thoroughly their lives and world while we struggle daily in our own. I can't wait to see who she writes about next."
4,Great insight into one of history's most (in)famous women,"Margaret George, with her usual thoroughness, draws the reader into ancient Egyptian society with all it's color, danger and intrigue. A fascinating read for anyone interested in Cleopatra or Egypt in general. While George takes many historical licenses, the overall plot is consistent with fact. Enjoyable from page 1 to the end"
3,Was expecting more,Based on the reviews I was expecting a real page turner. It was slow and hard for me to get into. It did pick up about half way though.
5,Spectacular novel,"One of the few books I've read where I've been unable to resist coming back to it again and again. The quasi-autobiographical viewpoint makes the story exceptionally engrossing. I love all of Margaret George's novels, but this one is far and away my favorite."
4,"Great research, beautifully written","Margaret George has a way with words. This is my first MG book and what a book to start with! I confess, it took me a while to get into it, though I appreciated what I read I was not pulled in. The book is a staggering 956 pages (if you don't include th authors notes etc.) and while the book read like poetry at times it also got tedious in the explanations of things; such is history though. Though I know that Julius Caesar and Cleopatra's relationship is very much more romantic in the book than it was in life, it was easy to sucumb to getting swept away in a literary crush on MG's Caesar. I felt the frustration's of the Egyptian Queen as well as the swell of love and pride for her children and her Antony. I had before a disdain of Octavian but in the book found myself expressing aloud agreements in finding his cold fiendish actions a neverending well. I don't imagine myself ever reading this for a second time, but I am glad I read it a first."
5,Wonderful,"Pretty historically acurate, very interesting, but long. If you don't want a long read don't get this book. It's 1000 pages. I loved this book. It kept me enthraled from begining to end."
3,"Great, Good and then Snooze...","I started off reading this book on fire! I couldn't get enough. All points that were made were relevent and interesting. There seemed to be a point. About halfway through, it started to feel a little tedious and too many minute and unimportant details were replacing interesting ones. By the time I was 2/3 through it, it was all I could do to make myself pick it up. It was reading like a history book with entirely too many little redundancies. This book would've been marvelous if the editor had been more on-the-ball.I've read every Margaret George book so far except Mary Queen of Scotland and the other's are top-notch in every way. This was just ok---a mediocre work by a normally brilliant author."
2,Long and Boring,"Margaret George has painted flat and unrealistic characters with no flaws. She would have us believe Cleopatra and Caesar were wise and benevolent rulers without any emotions. Nineteen year old Cleopatra, too often, speaks in the voice of a 21st century, thirty year old woman. It seems George knows her history however, she papers over her characters' documented bad behavior with made-up excuses and sometimes she ignores historical facts altogether.This book is for people looking for lush and extravagant romance novels with gilded ships, jewel encrusted furniture and silk robes. For those who like good historical fiction, look elsewhere."
4,History comes alive,"The Memoirs of Cleopatra is a mammoth novel, both in size and scope. Crammed full of historical events, real-life characters and period detail, it breathes new life into the familiar story of the fabled Queen of Egypt.The book revolves around a triumvirate of finely crafted characters: the ambitious Cleopatra, the aloof Caesar, and the vacillating Antony. While the tale occasionally bogs down under its sheer weight--I felt like I needed a scorecard to keep track of all the characters--it is nonetheless a riveting read.Margaret George is a fine writer, skillfully depicting epic battles, palace intrigues, and tender intimacies. At times, as Cleopatra reflects upon her life or upon human nature, George's prose is profound and takes on the beauty of poetry.I think this book would appeal to just about anyone who likes historical fiction. Don't let its size intimidate you."
5,Great Book,I read at lunch and am still reading this book!! It mixes facts with the everyday life and you get totally enthralled in it and time just passes by!
3,Enjoyed With Some Reservations,"It took me forever to finish this and not just because it's long. George goes into such detail about even the most mundane things that there are times when it was a bit of a bore to me. Quite frankly, I almost gave up on the book, which is something I almost never do.I persevered, however, and I must admit that despite the issues I had, it is an achievement. After finishing, there is a real sense that you have witnessed Cleopatra's entire life even if the historical narrative differs with what is presented in the bookRecommended for the patient reader"
5,Long but worth it!,"When I received this book in the mail, I noticed it was nearly 1,000 pages long! I thought I'd never get through it, but the minute I started reading it I could barely put it down. This is a page turner and will not disappoint. It is a terrific account of Cleopatra, Cesar, Antony and all the events that happened during their lifetimes. A must read!"
3,A Reading Marathon,"I've loved all George's books but I can't seem to get to the end of Cleopatra. The first 700 pages were fine, the next 100 I found myself skimming for action and the last 150 pages I can't seem to finish. Of course, we all know how it ends so I find myself thinking, ""Grab an asp and get this over with already! "" I have finished 10-mile runs that required less stamina than this book! Forewarned is forearmed...be prepared to spend a LONG, LONG time with this book. It is good, but I'm not sure it's THAT good."
3,GOOD - BUT MUCH TOO LONG!,"I am not averse to reading long novels. In fact, I am a Michner fan, which says it all about long novels. This book could have been done in about 500 pages, but plodded along for an extra 500. It is rich in detail and tells the story of one of the world's more interesting women. I must admit that I learned things I did not know, but there is a limit as to how much detail is necessary in describing every banquet, every outfit, every sunrise and sunset on the Nile. Enough is enough. I made it to the end and I am not sorry I read the book - just sorry it wasn't shorter."
5,You feel as if you are there with Cleopatra...,"I have never read a better novel about Cleopatra. I felt as if Ms. George had really gone back in time and wrote this from experience. This book goes from Cleopatra's childhood through her marriages until her death. It delved into her friendships and the history of the battles she fought. Cleopatra has come alive in this book. It was so hard to put the book down. As it's very long book you have to put it down, but the book is done in Chapters and Scrolls, so you can find a great place to stop and then you can pick right up where you left off. This book is a marvel. The detail that went in to it, the historical facts and the way they were seemlessly integrated made this book come to life. While I read it, I really felt it was Cleopatra talking and Ms. George made me forget that it wasn't written by Cleopatra or that it was a novel. I was able to lose myself in the book completly."
3,How many banquets can a book describe in 900+ pages?,"This started out great and I enjoyed the book up to Ceasar's death. After that, it seems that all Cleopatra did was have sex, obsess about Antony, throw banquets, and repeat. This book should have been about 500 pages shorter! Henry the Eighth is still my favorite."
5,A lush and tangible trip back into an indespensible era,"Margaret George does an excellent job in this retelling of the turbulent life of Cleopatra VII. The detail is astounding and every character from Cleopatra herself to much smaller characters like her personal servants is meticulously defined. I would reccomend this book to absolutely anyone interested in ancient history. It's not just a book about Egypt, but Rome also and the great empire's struggle after the death of Julius Caesar. The book is of astounding size, 963 pages, but don't shy away if you don't like large books, the pages of this one seem to melt away as you are transported to ancient Alexandria and the infamous queen's side. The Memoirs of Cleopatra is a finely written and researched book and is nothing short of a masterpiece, George is truly a gifted writer. Read this book, you won't regret it!"
5,The Memoirs of Cleopatra,EXCELLENT book. Helped tremendously to understand the goings-on that led to Cleopatra and Antony's defeat. Full of interesting info about how people lived at the time. Some of their sophistication will surprise you. This book spurred me on to learn more about her.
3,"Solid, but not that scary...","If the first Pender book was by turns revolting, scary, and creepy...this one tries to be, but has a lighter tone. Pender is great fun (I wish we had more of Sid, the wise cracking, dapper best friend to Ed), but we don't get even get as much of him. Linda is a decent character, who is not fleshed out. We get a lot of Simon Childs (not real clever with that name, but oh well), who is fascinating in theory, but only fairly interesting in reality. I would have liked more Pender. The book is good in that it does not dwell too long on any one chase (as the last book did at times). The last one worked for pure scare factor, this was more fun, but there are many better thrillers out there. Oh, and why is Nasaw always trying to show us that he must have scored well on his Verbal SATs? I wonder what he is trying to overcompensate for. Still, I'd welcome another Pender novel, but I hope he enjoys his retirement first."
2,Eye Catching Title,"Such a dumb book. Almost like a drawn out definition of ""FEAR"" itself.And I mean the ""word"" fear itself."
2,Fear?,"I'm being generous with a 2 star rating, gripping this story was not. I had put this book down several times and it was shear stubbornness that I made myself finish it. Revealing the killer in the first quarter of the book lost my interest.I experimented in reading the remaining chapters by skipping all sections that had reference to the killer 'Simon'and a really obscure section dealing with his sister. This did not present any problems in following the storyline. I have read many thriller stories dealing with FBI investigations and this had to be the sloppiest. Skipping sections of the book sped up the reading considerably and shortened the story, thankfully.If this killer was using 'fear', it was a poor attempt. Just pick anyone off the street and torture them, you'll get the same results. I really want to give this one star, I'm just sorry that I spent the time finishing it."
3,"I'll stick to Jeffery Deaver, thank you.","I had expected a whole lot more. Interesting premise but nothing in the plot was really scary. The villian was just obnoxious and not much more in my opinion. This guy doesn't know scary like Thomas Harris or Jeffery Deaver. The finale was, simply put, disappointing."
3,some new moves,"The 30 minute standing work seemed ineffective, but the last 15 minutes of mat exercises felt that with a few more repetitions the exercises would be worth doing. The instructor Katalin Zamiar is in great shape which is inspiring."
2,Very Beginner,I couldn't finish this video because it was so boring and basic. I gave it two starts because it may be useful for someone starting pilates. I am not advanced but I didn't find it challenging at all. If you need to work on balance this could be helfpul.
2,Where's the Pilates?,"This workout focuses on legs, legs, legs. The mat work is so basic that it's hard to recognize the Pilates basis, and the ab workout is nearly absent. The balance exercises are ok, but very repetitive. I have numerous pilates DVD's, and this is the first one I wish I could return."
1,"Emphasis on ""Blend,"" Not on ""Pilates""","I bought this because I was taking a certification class in Standing Pilates. With a couple of exceptions, the exercises don't bear much resemblance to anything I learned in class. Mostly, they are more like ballet, which is fine -- but don't call it ""Pilates."" There is also a section of matwork that I thought might be okay for people who already know what they are doing, but there is not enough instruction for newcomers to perform the exercises correctly. In short, there are better DVDs out there."
3,Reprints of this classic history lack the wonderful fold out maps,"Purchasers of this classic civil war history need to be aware that the original Macmillan hardcover editions contain 8 full-color, fold-out maps, that you will not likely find in such marvelous form in the print-on-demand paperback reproductions. The original maps are one of the real treasures of this title and so any editions without them would, I'm sorry to say, be considered woefully inferior."
5,"""There's Somebody Waiting for You""","Sam Mcgee will make you slap your thighs and tap your toes. This is the best of old time radio performance and it has all the crackles and pops, too."
3,Not the best by far,"I tried one of these that came with my Merkur '1904' and I was not impressed at all. I am a fan of Feather and once you try a Feather, you will never go back."
3,Not the Sharpest blade of the bunch.,This is a DECENT blade for those who do not shave everyday or have thick stuble. For me I have to shave everyday and have thick stuble and this product will not work in that kind of situation simply because it is just not sharp enough to do the trick and will leave you with razor burn or cuts especially on the neck portion. My recommended blade is the feather for those of you who are in the same situation as me and wish to use a safety razor.
2,Not sharp enough,"Merkur may make decent razors, but these blades are not sharp enough for me. After trying 3 of these blades, enough is enough, too much razor burn and not close enough... next."
4,Each razor lasts about 15 uses,"These are decent blades. I get about 15 uses out of each one . . . I've recently switched over to Feather blades, giving them a shot, but I don't have any major complaints about the Merkur blades. They're the ones I have used for ages."
2,Only as good as a dull Feather.,"When I purchased my Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor, I only had the Merkur blade it came with, a box of10 Feather Razor Blades NEW Hi-stainless Double Edgeblades and a box of Merkur blades. I used the original Merkur blade for a week and then switched to the Feather blades and used them until I finished that box. I was very pleased with the performance after a week for these blades. Then I went back to start using my box of Merkur blades and a new blade serious felt WORSE than a week old Feather blade. More tugging and effort required leaving more irritaion. I just cannot recommend these in comparison to the Feather brand. If I get different brands to compare to, I will update my review."
2,"COMPARED TO FEATHER, THEY'RE DULL AS A BUTTER KNIFE","I tried these when first bought my Merkur ""Fat Boy"" razor. I thought they were good, however, that was before I tried Feather blades. Merkur blades are dull and not sharp from the get go, in comparison. They pull your beard and always nick you up. Feather blades from Japan, on the other hand, are THE best. Literally, ""razor"" sharp, they cut through a three day growth with ease. I will not buy the Merkur blades anymore, and will go back to the Japanese brand, which makes it a pleasure to shave. Which is exactly why I went to DE wet shave razors in the first place."
5,The sharpest blades I've ever encountered,"I became aware of these blades after watching a cable TV program called, ""How it's made"", so I specifically sought this brand. Not only are these the sharpest blades I've ever tried, but they hold their edge longer than any blade in any type of razor. It seems difficult to believe that such a fine product could come in such a cheesy package, but I'm sold and I will continue to buy only this brand until such time as it becomes unavailable."
3,Average Blades,Though I love the Merkur super blades and rate them 5 start the non-super is only average. It feels kind of rough on my face and like it is hacking a bit. I normally use Shark blades and they are much better than this. I got a free blade in a Merkur razor so tried without buying. I'm glad I did. I was so impressed with Merkur supers that I might have bought these.
3,Just OK,"Got these blades to go in my new Merkur razor. It's not that they are a bad blade, but I recently tried Feather blades and wow what a difference! Feathers are much sharper and last longer. I have a rough beard and soft skin and Merkur blades just seem to drag and pull while cutting. The Feather blades just glide and cut."
4,Decent Blade,I just used these blades for the first time after switching from cartridges to a de safety razor. They are a good baseline blade. Personally I think they do a great job. Much better than the cartridge razors now days. Gave me the best shave of my life.
5,Good blade for me,"I like these blades for wetshaving a lot, hence 5 stars. Blades are a very personal choice and many other factors play in to the result one gets from them, so here are my conditions:- Wetshaving for 2 months at time of writing.- Merkur Classic Safety razor.- My beard is not dense, straight whiskers.- Shave daily.The blades give me close shaves and I have yet to cut or nick myself (knock on wood). The sharpness is very consistent from one blade to the next, and I change blades every week usually. I have read that these blades are not considered the sharpest in the spectrum of DE blades, so if you have a dense or thick beard, these might not be sharp enough for a shave without tugging. But sharper blades also mean more irritation, so you'll have to find the right fit for you."
1,This garbage will tear up your face in no time,"Don't buy this product. It is rough on the skin and will tear it up every time you shave. It came with the Merkur shaver I bought years ago and made me consider switching back to standard triple blades. Now I use Shark, which is a lot better."
3,"Needlessly Aggressive, Overpriced.","For the price, there are better blades. They are sharp enough with the right prep (some people claim that they drag a bit), but I'm pretty confident that they are a fraction of an millimeter longer than some other blades, and this tends to lead to a bit more razor burn. However, they do offer a close shave. I feel that there are much better options for the price; Persona (imported and domestic varieties), Derby, Feather, etc. I can use all of these interchangeably. Pretty much everything gives me a better shave, but everyone's face is different."
4,Great gift idea for shaving,Got this as part of the shaving set for my boyfriend.He loves it and his face is so smooth.
5,Jetdirect EW2400,It is a typical HP product pricey but works flawlessly. Had to install drivers for Windows pc's. To my surprise the Linux boxes automatically found print server and installed drivers without human intervention.
3,DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK,"Keeps loosing printer when wireless. Works if I plug in but paid for it to be totally wireless, so disappointed."
5,Great book and man!,"I read this book and then bought one for my best friend. What a true Christian gentleman that wrote this. If everyone read this book and applied his principles, the world would be a 1000 times better."
1,poor,It seems to be a slightly enlarged version of the previous form of it. But in the process of making it larger print the text became impossible to read. There are letters and words missing. On numerous pages the first few letter on the left side of the page are completely missing. This book should never have been put into print with the quality that it is.
2,Not for Badminton stringing,"May be it is good for tennis stringing but I can't tell. It is not for Badminton stringing. If it does, very clumsy."
5,QUITE a bargain!,"Don't question for a moment the tremendous value here. There are ten different media represented here -- and enough of everything to keep kids (and adults!) busy for quite some time.Your imagination is the only limit, and that is as it should be!Creativity for Kids Totally Awesome Art is very well named, and I highly recommend it."
2,Poor kit,"My 7 year old and my 3 years old found this kit boring, the art selection is very poor and it did not last long."
3,Review of High Yield Comprehensive for STEP 1,This book covers information in a manner that is to superficial for thorough STEP 1 revision.
5,Most user-friendly,"This is the best bookkeeping book I've stumbled upon. It is organized well, meaning the order of chapters follows a layperson's logic and prepares them well for the task ahead."
3,STUCK AT CHAPTER 2. BOOKKEEPING STILL STUMPS ME.,"I am a 52 year old adult and somehow missed these lessons in prior schooling. I made it to chapter 2 with enthusiasm, though. The ""why"" of accounts continues to escape me. Such as why something not entirely owned (bought on credit, for instance) can be an asset. I continue to struggle with the concepts and can't move on until I ""get it""."
2,Maybe for the student,"At best: A simple, clear, student workbook.At worst: Lame, out of date, historical documentary.All excercises are hand written and methods do not include any mention of computers, email, spreadsheets, or other standard parts of any modern business. A great way to bore any student to tears, but unreadable for a small business that needs to get the job done quickly."
3,Linus vs. Windows,"Surprised to have gotten this book so cheaply !I suppose amazon does not permit bogus sales for 1$ !Linux is a necessary things for when programmers are limited with Windows that is for mainly the common user !Have not read yet, just put it in my library !George."
5,Captivating,"This is an astonishingly beautiful CD. I listen to a lot of jazz piano trios and 4tets, and this is one of my favorite disks. I bought one for my car, and another for home, and several for friends. It's a pity it isn't better known. Give it a try: take a risk. You'll be glad you did."
5,Finally!,"FINALLY a fresh original country band that is comprised of seriously talented artists! If you like original and organic material, with quality songwriting, performance and explosive sound, this debut album from Sixwire will blow you away! I would describe this band as being influenced by the great harmony and guitar bands like the Eagles and Poco. I usually get bored quickly, but I haven't taken this out of my player since I bought it. This album just feels good and the depth of this CD will have me hooked for a long time!"
5,AWESOME!,"I saw these guys live last night at a hockey game - not only do I want to buy everything they put out - if they were a company I'd buy stock in them, LOTS of stock! The best music I've heard in a long time is coming from Sixwire. These guys are true star material not just a flash in the pan, they are rising to the top and I expect them to stay there a very long time. You know how you buy an CD because one song is really good and if you're lucky there's another one or two that are also pretty good, not so with this one, EVERY song is excellent for it's own merits!"
2,Needs to be updated,"This book is ok, but it's biggest flaw is how dated it is. In the world of videography and computer editing the technology moves forward so fast this book can't help but be dated. There were some juicy tips for the independent moviemaker in there though. I recommend borrowing it or checking it out at a library."
1,Yuck,"Dont buy this, its just his own personal experiences of making horrible sounding DV film. He gives bad advice, and sugguests not using a script. As said before, look at who is giving you advice before you take it. If you really want this book buy a used copy."
3,Frankly boring.,"This was a disappointing book. History is so much more interesting than this! It was one of the driest, most boring accounts of this event that I have ever read. It is more boring than a textbook (this is the worst criticism...)The only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 2 is that it does give the facts of the event. If you are looking for a book to interest a child in the Revolutionary War, keep looking."
5,"Old, but good","I bought a copy of this back in 2001. It is no longer actively developed, but it is great software if you can find an older machine to run it on. The free version of BeOS 5, called Personal Edition, can be downloaded from [...] if you'd like to see if you have a machine that can run it before buying. The major problem most people run into is there is a kernel bug which prevents it from running on a computer with more than 1GB of ram. In 2000, this wasn't a problem, but obviously it is now. If you're interested in an updated version of BeOS 5 that runs on more modern hardware, download Haiku for free at [...]. It's only alpha right now, but it's a great operating system to experiment with."
5,R&B PAVAROTTI.,"a voice like no other, jc is the coolest thing since power steering. as gymnastic as any vocalist you'll hear in THIS lifetime, i'd willingly listen to his renditions of 'three blind mice,' and 'the hokey pokey.' not having this record is like calling down a plague. don't tempt fate. buy one and have your friends buy one. otherwise all the flowers will die."
3,Slightly original,"I will give this a 60/40 rating. There are a lot of guitar players around that sound like this, but this album. does have a difference in it's compositions which I can't put my finger on. A yngwie spin, yes/no/maybe, but definately not Yngwie. This album also flows quite well and does display certain changes in style of play. Some of this material actually reminds me of Roth."
4,Book,Lots of highlighting but it was all important stuff so it actually helped me. THANKS! Speedy service!
5,The cult in the dark world of CD biz!,"As italian, having this CD is a great honour but the sound that You can hear in this records is much more than music!"
3,Dissipointment,"This cd is one that is bittersweet for me. There are some pretty good songs with some great riffs, however, the vocals on this album are some of the worst I have heard. With a different singer (and maybe a different name) the band would be much more popular I believe.[...]."
4,"Great System and Value. There are Better, but not for the price!","Just got mine in the mail today, easy to set up. These speakers are amazing for the price, they have good bass, and a crisp sound. Now saying that, these have good sound but there are definitely better. If you need a good pair or computer speakers, I'd say these are a good bet, movies/tv shows/songs get a little more dimension with these, but if you're looking to make a good investment for your entertainment system, I'd say look a around a little more. These play music great though, I'm definitely satisfied. :)"
5,Absolutely worth the money,"For the price, I can almost guarantee this is the best product on the market. It was exactly as advertised. I purchased the speakers for my professional film editing studio and they are working out fantastically. I really have nothing bad to say about them, the sound is crisp, the system is compact yet powerful, and they look pretty slick too."
5,Great for the money!,"For under $40, this set of computer speakers are well worth the money. They should be charging more than $40. The bass is strong enough for me since I'm not an audio freak. These speakers are for you if you just need something to listen to your music on your computer. They are great for pop, rock, rap, and techno."
4,Great for the price,Perfect speakers for a low budget. I took step back in sound quality due to replacing my Klipsch speakers but I knew that when i bought these.I like how the power switch is on the front of one of the speakers and not on the back of the amp.
2,compared with other speakers....not so impressed,"i own an eagle ET-AR504LR-BK speaker and decided to compare it side by side with my friend's CA-3550WB:in terms of sound quality 504 reproduced very fine details in pretty much all types of movies or music that we played. the 3550 sounded muddy, especially in the treble and mid-range.in terms of sound volume 504 got very loud when we turned the volume up to 40%, there was no distortion until 80% but my friend and i could not withstand the volume already, it was so loud that we could not hear each other. the 3550 got to similar volume level but distortion was much more noticeable.in terms of features the 504 came with full function remote, LCD display and digital equalizer. the 3550 did not have any of those.call me biased but both my friend and i agree that 504 is a much nicer speaker for just about 10 dollars more.your listening experience may be different and the best way to tell two speakers apart is by comparing them side by side like we did."
3,BEWARE,"The product pictured is not what you will receive, you will get the CA 3550 which is the basic model with gray 6.5"" sub woofer, only the right satellite speaker has the power on blue light indicator, I have told Amazon about the error and they tried to correct it only to send me the exact same thing twice, I am however going to keep one set as they did give me a discount and they do sound ok, just disappointed that they are not the 8"" 64 watt setup I was hoping for."
2,Cheap sound at a cheap price,"If you are looking for an inexpensive computer sound system with THUNDERING BASS, but terrible audio quality than this is for you! I purchased a Cyber Acoustics speaker system a few years ago from K-mart and was pleasantly surprised by the audio quality. Being in the market again, I remembered how pleased I was and decided to try them again. I typically use my computer speakers for listening to music.If you care about audio quality, this system is a big mistake. The bass is WAY to heavy, and the little speakers ridiculously shrill, resulting in an awful sound of overwhelming bass mixed with a cacophony of nail on chalk board sounds. The mid range is almost completely absent. Imagine Alicia Keys, with the thumping bass and shrill highs on the piano with her voice muffled."
3,They're Okay,"If you like dancing, hip hop or any kind of electronic music, this is a great buy because this bass THUMPS! But I mostly listen to rock and heavy metal and these speakers only sound okay with those genres. These are really not adequate for movie watching due to the lack of mid range. There's either too much bass or there's too much crackling. I find myself constantly adjusting the bass and volume nobs on the right satellite speaker. All in all, these speakers are alright, they'll get the job done until I can afford a much higher quality set. If you throw or plan on throwing parties, these speakers are great to have, they'll get your invites on their feet and dancing!... Unless your party is lame of course."
1,Don't Buy.,"I bought it, and it was decent but after a day the sub-woofer stopped working. I wasn't even near it when it blew out, all i did was turn it on and the sub-woofer was not playing anything."
4,Good Bang for the Buck,I got these speakers about a month ago and I cant complain. I replaced my creative speakers with these and the sound is so much better.
4,I would reccomend these speakers,"These are some good speakers, better than all the other ones I bought. The sound is nice and the bass is loud if you want it to be, which I like."
5,best map of Colorado Plateau!,"This map is beautiful and very useful - labels landforms & all points of interest. Topographic shading is very effective. I have one I use as a map, & one hanging on my wall. Retails for ~ $10 at a few National Park bookstores (Canyonlands, Bryce Canyon, etc.) - don't know why it is selling for $49 online..."
4,Would definitely recommend!,"This was my first drink-mixing book that I bought and I am happy I did! I love the layout of the book! You can search recipes by what alcohol you have laying around or you can search by type of drink. I love that it tells you the history of the liquors, terms, what glasses to use for what etc. It really is handy for a first-time drink maker! The only thing I wish it would have are drink illustrations/pictures, but that's just my taste! Thank you!"
5,Great,great gift idea that turned out to be a users guide for everyone for the holidays. Sloshed is all i will say
2,Pretty face but no cigar.,"I bought this watch without having examined this model in person. While the sale price was alluring (all Perigaum products seem to have a comically unrealistic retail price), it quickly became apparent that this was not a watch for everyday use. Stylish, yes, but lacking any luminescence in the dial or hands (as do most of their products), so forget about trying to tell time in the dark. Frequent winding required. The instruction manual, if you can read it at all, is unhelpful at best, especially about using special functions. The font size is so small, a magnifying glass was required to read it. Perhaps it is more straightforward in the original German. In short, a very attractive but largely unuseful watch, even if deeply discounted."
1,Bad,"I received this caddy for a gift on Christmas and it was broken. The I sent it back and it cost me $30 to return. I do not recommend this company, they are over priced and do not pack the products appropriately."
3,Not a Self Teaching Guide for first timers!,"The book spills out formulas without adequate explanation. I don't learn unless I understand. It's a good book if you want to review concepts and formulas learnt elsewhere! The examples are simple and to the point, which is good.Overall, don't buy the book if you want to learn Linear Algebra for the first time, but get it if you want a refresher."
3,Gentle Introduction or Refresher Without The Theory,"This is probably a good book for those that have a prior background in linear algebra and are seeking to refresh their memory. However, I've found in reading this book that connecting the dots from one section or chapter to another can be confusing, especially where notation and semantics are concerned. For instance, a system of equations is referenced in terms of ""m by n"" dimensions, and another as ""n by m"". The author appears to prefer the approach of not telling the reader of details until he thinks the reader is ready. Some learn better in such manor, I don't; I suspect many refreshing their skills don't. So, it's not a bad book, just could have been better."
2,"Okay, but not as good as the ""Dummy Books"" collection","Exactly as stated in the title... should have purchased one of the ""Dummy"" books."
1,Too many typos in the examples,"There are so many typos in the examples that I find the book useless. For example, on page 13, the number 13 in the matrix suddenly becomes a 19, and remains the same throughout most of the example. On the top of page 25, the matrix multiplication has three typos! I cannot recommend this book to anyone. The author should have taken more time to check his work."
3,Linear Algebra Demystified,"What is explained is done so clearly, but the book is devoted almost exclusively to the algebraic approach. Those looking for geometric interpretations - say. of eigenvectors - will have to look elsewhere."
2,I would pass,"No compilation will ever live up to the original...the original was the best rap CD ever produced IMHO. If you think you'll like this CD because you just want to listen to a different flavor of the original tracks then it may be worthwhile to check out. Otherwise, there is absolutely no comparison. The original has straight genuine attitude which stamped it as one of the best albums in music history. This one tries..."
2,not as good as the original,If you have listened to the original cd you will find this one to be terrible. It can never be as good as the original. Also Snoop Dogg screwes up in Gangsta Gangsta
3,The original is better,"This cd is pretty good, but NWA's original version is a lot better. The 3 remakes on here that were really good are ""I Ain't Tha 1"" by Mister Mike, ""Dopeman"" by Mack 10, and ""Quiet On Tha Set"" by the Terror Squad. Snoop and C-Murder's version of ""Gangsta Gangsta"" was pretty tight too. Check it out!"
5,Great late 90's West Coast Gangsta Rap!,"I thought this was great 90's West Coast Gangsta rap at it's fullest! All of it was far out but ""Straight Outta Compton,"" ""8-Ball"" & ""Dopeman"" were my favorites. The beats, synthesizers & keyboards in the songs were outstanding & still sound up to date 11 years later. I also recommend Mack 10's the Recipe, Ice T's Return of the Real, Ice Cube's War & Peace vol 1, C-BO's Til My Casket Drops & the Luniz' Operation Stackola if u like this type of Muzik! Westsiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiide!"
4,a matter of strength,"This short novel is an interesting study in inner strength. We are introduced to a young priest and his mother. We discover from the beginning that the priest is having an affair with a young widow in town. He is challenged by his mother whose faith impresses us with its strength. The priest, in turn, seems weak in that area. As other events take place, we see a transformation in the priest who struggles and falls but forces himself to do the right thing. The mother, however, undergoes doubts and weakens in her resolve. In the climatic ending we are reminded that faith is constantly challenged and thus is in need of regular maintenance.As in all of Grazia Deladda's novels, the reader gets a sense of life in the distant world of rural Sardinia and an appreciation for the story-telling abilities of this Nobel Prize-winning author."
4,Great Debut CD !!! (I'd give it 4.5 stars),"It's definately a more guitar,bass,drum oriented release compared to the bands' later CDs..It's alot like a John West solo CD...As it sounds like a band instead of it being mostly dominated by Keyboards...But Vitalij does write all the music so it makes sense that the keys would be so prominent in later releases....My Favorite songs are World Of Illusion,Into the Eye of the Storm,Smoke and Fire,The Key,and **Song of the Desert**(The intro keyboard riff of this song is almost identical to the riff on ""Your Victory"" off the Sacred Pathways CD) Vitalij must have liked it so much he decided to use it again...lol..but all in all it's a great CD!!"
3,"Not bad,but a bit sterilized...","Revolving around the great talents of Ukrainian-born keyboardist Vitali Kuprij,Artension are an up-and-coming progressive act,featuring the amazing voice of John West and the guitar skills of George Bellas(at least on this album).There's no doubt about their virtuosity,however the final outcome is too fixated in the Malmsteen-Rainbow-Purple tradition,and much too afraid to explore some new musical vistas."
1,What a Joke,Believe me when I tell you....this camera is a joke. You have to capture into sony's worthless software which allows little or no editing. I would consider this one of the worst purchases I have ever made. Absolutely no help from Sony techs and the geeks at best buy tell me I'm up a creek. Thanks sony.
2,Well....??,"The technology is coming, but it is one of those items that you might want to wait a year to see what updates they can do. The current Camera/DVD or Video war reminds me a lot of the Beta VS VHS war. It is just a matter of time before the Cameras are all DVD and have almost movie quality. I think at this point just for the simple reason that SONY has discontinued many other versions that were new 6 or 9 months ago, that should be reason enough to wait. But again.. it's up to you"
2,DO NOT BUY IF YOU OWN A MAC!,"As a camcorder, I've found the DCR-201 works pretty well... both the picture and sound quality of recordings have been just fine, by and large.HOWEVER, I am frustrated beyond words at the fact that this piece of Sony equipment is not Mac compatible! My primary rationale in purchasing a Mini-DVD camcorder (as opposed to one using another format) was the idea that I could edit and make copies of film on my computer. What Sony & Amazon failed to mention ANYWHERE - in product descriptions, in Amazon reviews, etc. - is the fact that the Sony/Pixela editing software (which many other reviewers have complained about) is NOT Mac compatible. And, from what I can tell, neither Sony nor Pixela have any intent of releasing a Mac version of the software.All of which means... well, it means that I wasted a lot of time, effort and money. If you own a Mac, DO NOT buy a Sony mini-DVD camcorder."
1,Do not waste your money,"We bought this camcorder in 2004 when it first came out. Seemed like a decent deal at the time. First problem, have lens adapter to put additional lenses on it but can't screw them on b/c of the way the cd portion is shaped. Second and BIGGEST problem: CCD DIED. 2 years old. Used maybe 5 or 6 times. Worst use of $800 I've ever had. Now it is off warranty and Sony wants $211 to fix it. And no, it is NOT COVERED UNDER THE RECALL AS THE 200 MODEL IS. Same problem according to the website pictures of the 200 model recall information. My camera says it was manufactured in April 04. The recall only covers until MARCH 04. After reading the other reviews on data loss, we will have to seriously consider whether we choose Sony or not. I've had issues with Sony in the past (over Trinitron parts and cost of repair), and apparently some things have not changed with that company. If I could give it ZERO stars I would."
3,sony DCR-DVD201 Handycam,"It does an excellant job shooting movies, but still camera has a lot to be desired. I bought the video flash light, it helps some, but I was expecting more for the still pictures"
1,Will ERASE your memories! DON'T BUY!!,"I've had this camera for over a year. It's a gamble to use however. You'll either be able to finalize your discs with no problems and have a great little DVD of your favorite moments, or it will have an error and erase everything! It's really up to how it feels at the moment, too. You have to record without moving as well, remember, there's a tiny laser etching data inside there and any sudden turns will erase the disk.If you can get it to work, the picture will look FANTASTIC! But it's really too much a gamble to take. Don't buy."
1,"PLEASE, PLEASE DO NOT BUY A SONY BRAND CAMCORDER","JUST LIKE SEVERAL OTHERS I BOUGHT THIS CAMCORDER WHEN IT FIRST CAME ON THE MARKET. MINE WAS PURCHASED IN DEC. 2004. IT WORKED FINE UNTIL JUNE OF THIS YEAR. AFTER SPENDING CLOSE TO AN HOUR ON THE PHONE WITH SONY'S REPAIR DEPT. I FOUND OUT IT WILL COST $211 TO REPAIR, AND I ONLY GET A 90 DAY GUARANTEE ON THAT. MY CAMCORDER JUST STOPPED WORKING, PERIOD! FOR NO REASON AT ALL, THE LCD SCREEN WAS THE FIRST THING THAT WENT, THEN IT WOULD NOT CHARGE, THEN IT WOULD NOT EVEN POWER ON!! THIS CAMERA HAS NEVER BEEN DROPPED, HIT, NEVER WET, NEVER USED OUTSIDE IN RAIN OR SNOW ETC; THIS IS THE BIGGEST WASTE OF $800 I HAVE EVER SEEN, AND IT'S OBVIOUS FROM THE OTHER OPINIONS I HAVE READ, I'M NOT THE ONLY PERSON TO HAVE GOTTEN THE ROYAL SHAFT FROM SONY. MY NEXT LETTER WILL BE TO SONY. SO ANYBODY AND EVERYBODY, PLEASE, PLEASE, DO NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING MADE BY SONY!!!!"
1,No support-poor software,"Bought this camcorder about five years ago for more than a thousand dollars. Big mistake. Sony provided little support for the dvd201 then, and has none now. The software was almost impossible to use, but if you lose it, cry, nothing else works, and there is no where to get a replacement."
3,Camera has problems with blank DVD-R discs,"The camera won't work with CompUSA DVD-R's (I tried a bunch of them). I don't know if it is the camera's fault or CompUSA's, but I recommend trying out the blank DVD-R's in the store before taking them home."
1,Don't buy this camera!!!,"I own this camera. Nowhere does Sony tell you that this camera will only function reliably with sony discs. The manual only tells you it has to be an 8cm disc. When you turn the camera on (after you buy it) it will show ""sony disc reccomended"" on the screen, not required. After losing discs to access error messages (this included my daughters sweet 16 party,an overseas trip and finally a vacation in the mountains) I sent it in to sony. Sony sent it back stating nothing was wrong, but that sony discs had to be used to guarantee it will work (stated nowhere on the box or manual). The sony discs are hard to find and more expensive than any other brand. Sony forces you to buy their discs after you've bought the camera otherwise why not clearly state Sony Discs Mandatory on the box or handbook prior to purchase. They are ripping their customers off!"
1,Amateurish,"Even though Amanda is quite attractive, the camera work is bad, the lack of professionalism throughout make this naked yoga DVD a bitter disappointment. There are few close-ups and when the camera operater tries to get in close focus goes out the window. A bit of rehearsal may have made the actual yoga scenes a bit better. If you are looking for an accidentally soft focus DVD of a relatively pretty young lady doing joga naked while she discusses what she is to do with the photographer and looking lost, this is for you."
2,Eye-candy/Not yoga.,"As stated in other reviews, this is not a yoga instructional video.Amanda is fine to look at but her boyfriend wasn't much help coaching her through the positions."
1,An extremely difficult read .,This book has many troubling angles for a Traditional Roman Catholic to accept.He does not seem to even believe in Christ's Resurrection nor the actual resurrection of the body at the end of time.Luther would love this book.
5,IT'S ALL ABOUT JESUS,Reading this amazing book is like being wrapped in a warm blanket reading the writings of a beloved friend who is sharing his heart with you alone. Not only is the scholarship amazing but the heart of a man who is in love with Jesus comes through clearly and loudly. Don't miss this book.
5,Hoodoo man,"I bought hoodoo man blues CD because it was once rated top 10 blues albums. I was hooked on Junior Wells after I heard it HooDoo Man bought two more Junior Wells CDs. This CD does not disappoint. Classic blues, classic Junior Wells."
3,A Little Disappointed,"I was happy to find a wine carrier that had real glass glasses. I was disappointed when it arrived and I saw how tiny those glasses were. I kept it, because it does serve a purpose allowing me to have wine glasses when I stay in a hotel that only has plastic ones. Wine just doesn't taste right in those."
5,This was a great but disgusting book !,This book would be great for 4th or 5th graders. It was about how Bogie death mystery is solved.
4,Eye Opening,"This piece of work really opens your eyes and shows the great talent of William Shakespeare. I think that if anyone likes his other works will love this. If your not a Shakespeare fan, this should be the book you read first."
1,"awful, horrible","This is easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen. This is one of Shannon Tweed's first films. After this disaster, she would go on to become queen of the B-movie, which is why I expected a lot more from this. The acting is horrible, the ""special"" effects are even worse. The explosions, deaths, and general mayhem of a fire fight are poorly done repeatedly throughout the movie. Oh, the one [love] scene in the movie is hidden behind a rock! What's the frikkin' point of the NR rating!?!"
1,Guerilla Bore-fare...,"International mega-star, Reb Brown headlines this modern spectacle. He plays a military man who is betrayed by his comrades, only to join the very rebel force he'd been helping to wipe out. The rebels all wear sparkling clean, mint condition uniforms, even though they've spent months in the jungle! Their hats are brand new, right off the sporting goods shelf! Reb Brown's ex-buddies all wear what appear to be freshly pressed UPS uniforms! Watch as these two factions run around shooting and blowing each other up! By the end, I didn't care who lived or died, as the characters were all so bland and generic! Oh yeah, Shannon Tweed is in this pile too! She keeps her hair lovely and manageable throughout, despite the infernal jungle heat! Watch this one and you'll be longing for Rambo and Chuck Norris to rescue you..."
2,Not a very accurate practice exam,It had a few verbal passages that were only 2 paragraphs long. Real mcat verbal passages are not 2 paragraphs. The review material is decent but the verbal section needs work.
4,"good review, but practice test somewhere else","This book covers many study and prep tips in detail. The information review is excellent, with many suggestions for quick hands-on learning experiments to help you grasp the material. It includes only one practice test and it did not seem thorough or in the actual MCAT format. A great book for learning/refreshing concepts, but I wouldn't use it for a practice exam."
2,Pretty But the Silver Peels Off,Cute at first but the silver started to peel off of mine and the maker does not respond to questions at the web site.
1,Awful stuff!,"This is nothing but crazed, chaotic, demonic noise disguised as music. This takes the gift of music given to us by God and turns it into something nasty and perverted. Guard your heart and stay away from this one please!!!"
4,TANGERINE REVIEW,"""Tangerine"" is one of the greatest books I've ever read. My favorite scene is when Paul figures out that ther's no reason to be afraid of Erik. I would recommend this book for mystery loving kids between the ages of 10&13. The reason this book is so interesting is because it's written in the form of a journal. This book is great!I like this book fo rmany reasons. One of those is that it is written in journal form so you can see the story from the main character's point of view. Another is that the story has a lot of suspense. It kept me sitting on the edge of my chair. The last reason is that it is a long book. I have a lot of extra time and reading books help me fill that time. If by reading this review you have a sudden urge to go by ""Tangerine"" please follow it and read this book today!"
4,"Great book,bad ending","I loved this book. I had to read it for summer reading,and was hooked. I was amazed at how the author described the sports sences. I could close my eyes and be there. Also,I was hooked on the first page which is not something that usually happenes for me. The characters were well descibed.But...When i got to the last 20 or so pages,I was thrilled. So much was happing ,i was amazed. It was so intense. But then,the last page was so stupid. We NEVER know what happens to Erik,Arthur,Kerri, or anyone! We never know what happened to Arthur.And how does Pauls 3rd first day of school work out (I cant say why..read it yourself. What about hte muck fire,and the lightning,and the soocer team. what about Paul,does he get contacts or laser eye surgrey? What aobut the main plots of the book? They were left completely unfinish. The book could and should have had aleast annother 50 pages.But otherwise it was a grreat book. They NEED to make a sequal."
1,Disturbing notions for kids,"I was unhappily surprised to buy this book for my 9-year old and find out it contains a murder by peers of a high-school aged boy and also a brutal childhood attack by the main character's brother, subsequently covered up by his own family. I really wish there were better content descriptions than the covers books present now. I'd never have bought this."
2,too complicated with too many ideas not a very good book,"Edward Bloor tried too hard to develop too many plots too fast. The book moved around to different topics and got very confusing in the end. I had to reread several paragraphs over again because of flaws and weird changes in the subjects. I didn't really like it, and it had too many depressing endings to too many plots. IT WASN""T VERY GOOD"
1,Horrifying even for adults,"I had to read this book when I was in junior high, and now, almost a decade later, I stil shudder at the multiple torture scenes vividly described in it. I am entirely against books like these being forced onto children. I hated them when I was younger, and I hate them even more now. Kids have overactive imaginations. When I read it I was scared and paranoid at the thought that characters like the ones in the book might actually exist, or worse, I might encounter them. Not to mention the inter-sibling violence. I have a younger brother and I can't ever imagine doing to him what was done to the main character. And all I could think back then and now is how if anyone had done that to me, I would be out for revenge. Is that the kind of state you want to put your kids in?I can't say anything about the quality of the writing. When I'm so struck by the gruesome content, it's difficult to pay attention to prose. The author must have been one disturbed child."
2,An ok read.,"This was in my opinion a good story. However it was very slow. Nothing interesting happens untill like halfway through the story and by then the stories super predictable. Also, there was little character development. Paul and his friend Joey seemed to have several different mood swings and weren't very smart. The book was overdramatic. Several little things were made into a big deal big things that happened were brief and confusing.Overall it was a good idea for a story but underdeveloped. If it were rewritten about the same thing and more development it would be a good book, however it was just ok"
1,Ummm... Fantastic!,"Tangerine was an ""read catching"" book. When my language arts class read it I couldn't help but pay attention.The book was about a boy named Paul Fisher who feels ignored by his family only because of his older brother Erilk's football dream, even though he is an awesome soccer player. While fearing Erik and his friend, Paul meets new friends and changes schools because a sinkhole that forms right under his school. Paul finds courage to stand up to his brother and lets readers know the REAL reason he is legally blind.I liked this book but if I could suggest any thing, it would be to get a better ending and I hope that Edward Bloor will write a sequel to this to Tangerine only because he kind of leaves the readers hanging at the end.Overall I really enjoyed this book!"
1,TANGERINE,"Stay away from this book! My friend and I were forced to read this book in class.. and, it may have been the worst book I've ever read. They just go on and on about god knows what. BORING!"
4,Thought-provoking; but Parents B-ware,"My ten-year old son absolutely loved this book. It is full of teen angst and sports-related action; however, the subject matter is very heavy and can be somewhat disturbing. The blurb on the back of the book gave me no indication that issues of violence and bullying in the book (and some uncomfortable language) were addressed within. The actual reading level is not difficult, but as thought-provoking as this book is, I recommend it for very mature kids or students in grades 7-12."
4,Too unrealistic.,"I really think the author did a good job writing the story. I really couldn't put it down, but it was really unrealistic. I really doubt parents would let their son do that to their other son. They would probably get him some help. Read this book if you like reading, but not if you are a very sceptical person."
2,Tangerine by Edward Bloor,"Paul Fisher and his family move to Tangerine, Florida. Just an ordinary move right? WRONG! Everything is going wrong. Paul is believed to be legally blind because of an accident that happened to him in his younger years. If he is ""blind"", then why is he the only one that notices all the strange things going on in Tangerine? His school is in portable buildings, lightning strikes the same house at the same time every day, and there is an evil side to his brother Erik that no one else seems to notice. Could things be any more hectic in Tangerine? Will Paul's family be forced to move back to their hometown? Paul Fisher is a 7th grader in this novel. I personally think this book is good for anyone between the ages of twelve and fourteen, You have to enjoy a good twisted mystery to want to read this book. In my opinion, the author stayed on ths same topic for too long of a period of time. Sometimes, my mind would wonder while reading the book, but in general it was an ok book."
5,tangerine,I read the book called tangerine this book was about a boy named paul he was bline and he was trying to find out how he got that way pauls brother eric was a big bully and did not like paul very mush pauls parent did not pay to mush attention to paul they where to weired about eric because they only cared about eric because he was going to be a football star someday.when pauls school feel in to a sink hole paul went from a geek to a cool kid.
4,Tangerine (geat book report book)!!!,Tangerine was a really good book. My friend and I read it for a book report and I thought it was very well written. Something new was happening all the time and writing journal-style was very creative. I do not usually read journal-style books but this one changed my mind about reading them.
3,3[1/2] stars. In the middle.,"This book I would say isn't the best. I know that some people wouldn't agree with that.(like my teacher) There isn't much of a story line or plot, just sorta like a journal type thing where Paul Fisher, the main character, tells about his brother, friends, his troubles at school. I would still recommend this book to people who like journal format books."
5,Tangerine,"Paul Fisher just moved to Tangerine county from Houston, Tx in a little surb. called Lake windsor downs. There Paul encounters a bunch of his past, and playing on the Tangerine middle school soccer team. Life couldnt be better for Paul, until someone starts robbing all the neighbors that live near Paul, and the mysterious death of a football player"
4,SWEET!!,"This book is good for people who are interested in football or soccer. If you are moving, it also helps you know what to do. I am not even done with the book yet and I think that this book is da bomb!! I can't stop reading it, and I DOn't evan like to read!!"
5,Tangerine,"This is the best book that I have ever read. I would reccommend that anyone who is into choices books reads this. My favorite part of this book was when Paul's (the main character), older brother got arrested because him and his friend killed someone because he was kind of a punk. I really enjoyed this book even though it was a class assignment..."
3,Tangerine,"The book Tangerine is about a 7th grader boy who is Paul. He is moving from Houstan, Texas to Tangerine, Florida. In this new town he struggles through weird experiences. The real mystery is about his older brother Erik. Also the mystery is why is he legally blind. He finds out all the secrets and mysteries as the book continues!"
2,Tangerine,"This book is about a legally blind seventh grade soccer player with a malicious older brother. His parents don't notice him and he struggles to show them the truth about his brother, Erik. He lives in a crazy town where fires burn constantly underground, it thunderstorms everyday, and houses are eaten by bugs. The book is supposed to be realistic but it's not. The characters and the events are very unrealistic. It kept my attention while I was reading it, though. If you like books that keep you guessing but the truth is not revealed to the end, this is a book for you. I would have made a few changes to make it more realistic, like the events that went on when the story takes place. I didn't learn anything from this book except for some good vocabulary which would make a good lesson plan. I may recommend this book to someone who is in 6th or 7th grade."
4,Give it a chance,"I think this book is a pretty good . You will like it, if yousoccer fan. You will not like this book if you don't like violence anddon't like people being made fun of. It is about a family of a mother,father, and two brothers,' they move to Florida. and the brother [themain charicter] has to move to 3 different schools Lake Winstar MiddleTangerine Middle and... The other brother is a trouble maker does somenasty things to people! Give it a chance. Read it!"
2,A decent book but highly overrated,"A lot of cardboard characters and racial/social stereotypes, a choppy plot-driven narrative, and tedious prose make this book difficult to read. The main character seems to have all the right answers while everybody else, especially adults, are out to lunch. He complains about the Eric Fisher Football Dream, while chasing the Paul Fisher Soccer Dream. The author tries to do too much, especially at the end when it's time to resolve all the loose ends."
4,The book was very exciting and realistic.,Tangerine was definitely a different kind of book. Paul Fisher has weird nightmares dating from his childhood that are brought on by different experiences in a town that he just moved into. These experiences relate to the damage done to Paul's eyes when he was younger. Paul's parents told him that a solar ecclipse damaged his eyes but Paul thinks there is a dark secret that they're hiding from him. Because of the damage Paul has to wear extra thick glasses all the time. Paul isn't allowed to play soccer for the Lake Windsor High Team since he is legally blind. Paul decides to transfer to Tangerine Middle School in order to be able to play soccer. Tangerine was a very good book to read because it had a well thought out story line and enough twists and turns to make you keep reading.
4,The good book with the bad ending,"Tangerine was a good book, with good characters and a good Plot. It indirectley taught u lessons but the ending was soo BAD!!. Why didnt his publisher tell him it was bad. I would of said ""Edward, i like you, we tight but is your ending is bad"" "" ""G, wont not body like this, one love."" So the book was good, well written but a bad ending.Au revoir"
1,Tangerine.,I didn't like this book. I'm not seven. I'm not even twelve. Paul Fisher is a character I can't relate to. His problems are petty and boring. If he didn't think their was anything wrong with his vision why does he worry about it so much? Move on.
1,ThE TaNgErInE ReViEw,"My NaMe : DaNieL C.CaTeGoRy : CoNtEmPoRaRy rEaLiStIc FiCtIoNBoOk TiTLe : TaNgErInEAuThOr : EdWaRd BLoOrAuDiEnCe : YoUnG aDuLt , GrAdEs 6-8GisT oF StOrY :Paul was a young kid that was an outcast in Houston. His brother constantly made fun of him and his parents failed to ""see"" the physical things. His dad was obsessed with Paul's brother's football playing and his mom was stuck in a world where physical appearances mattered most. Then, they moved to Tangerine, Florida and life changed for Paul. Paul made friends and fitted in his soccer team. His parents finally begin to see what Paul sees and Paul's ""bad"" brother faces justice.oPiNiOn oF BoOk : The theme of the story wasn't bad. Although, I didn't enjoy it as much as I hoped. I prefer books not set in the present.PoSSibLE cLaSSrOOm uSeS : can be used for vocabulary exercises, project, literal/figurative questions, play acting"
1,A 14 yaer old reader,"I only gave it one star because I don't really like thebook Tangerine.I only liked it a little bit because it is funnyin some places.If I was Paul I would'nt be scared of Eric because,he is a punk.He only picks on people smaller than him.I was glad when Eric and Author got bet up by Tino and Victorbecause it put him in his place."
3,Not appropriate for most 12 year olds!,"Psycho siblings and childhood trauma. I'm glad I decided to read this one before giving it to my son. The book has good character development and Mr. Bloor is clearly in touch with kids, but this book is definately for the older teen!! I was haunted by this one and would prefer to shield my kids while I still can."
2,A Class Read But No More,"My class was forced to read this book, and let me tell you, it sucked. I would not reccomend this book to anyone. It is cliched and boring and elementary. Younger readers may enjoy this book a little, but anyone older than 10 will indefinitely hate it. If you are a family member shopping for books for a gift for your 10 year old or older, chose another book."
5,one of the most thrilling books ever,"having been in a weird accident of looking atan eclipse, paul legally loses his eyesight, although he knows he can see just fine. although he is the best goalie in the league, his dad pays no attention to him and spends his time thinking about his older brothers football career in high school, where he is a star. another thing his parents don't know is that eric is extremely cruel, and has some dark secrets that paul is trying to figure out, as well as the truth about his eyesight.this book rules. i couldn't put it down for days. it has mystery, excitement, everything you could hope for. definitely read this book."
3,a cute boy from waynesboro,"The book I'm reiviewing is Tangerine and I think it's a good book,it's about a boy named Paul fisher and a boy named erik fisher I give this book 3 strars,because I kind of liked it and I kind of didn't,in the beginning it was kind of boring,because soccer isn't really my sport,but once we got to the middle it got a little better,the first couple pages let you know about Paul and erik's relationships, this book had a little action in it but after a while I just got tired of this book,because they basicly talked about soccer the whole time, so if you like soccer you will probally love this book,but if you don't like soccer you might not like it."
4,Tangerine By Edward Bloor Review By Nicole Baccus 12,"Tangerine is a really good book. my favorite scene in the book is where paul finds out what really hapened to his eye site. it's my favorite scene because it has a lot of suspense in the part and I like it, because it made me want to keep reading.I would recommend this book to kids in between the ages of ten and fourteen because the main character is twelve so I think it's best to be close to the age group to undderstand some stuff that happens.One thing I liked about the book is that is that its written in journal form.I like this because it has a lot of good stopping points, and your kept on a daily bases of when what event happened on what day.i really liked the book. At first it didn't sound so good but once I started to read I couldn't stop.I had to keep going. So I recommend you go out and get this book. you'll love it."
4,The memories lie beneath the paint.,"When Paul Fisher moves to Tangerine, he finds the truth within his long lost memories. Many questions are answered about his past and his brother. As his parents hide behind the shadow of the ""Erik Fisher Football Dream,"" Paul breaks out of the cycle of lies and finds the truth hidden within himself.Enter this journey as Paul discovers the truth beneath the paint."
5,A Story of Fight and Courage Not Just For the Young!,"I ordered this book on the basis of the Amazon young adult editor's review and I was not disappointed. I could hardly put this book down. I was drawn by Paul's character throughout the book, not your typical hero, but instead someone who ""sees"" things more clearly than those with better eyesight. I loved this book which shows that ability, popularity, and toughness are not what is important, it is people and really seeing them. It is well-written, excellenty plotted, drawing the reader along with the idea of finding out what really happened to Paul when he was five years old. This book is not just for young adults -- I am 32 and I loved it"
2,HELP ME!,"This could be a good book. It has lots of great ideas to get you into it. Problem is... WHAT is the plot? I had to do a book report on this book. The teacher asking about the plot. Well, I could pick from MANY! This book is NOT a good choice for a book report. What a struggle! Also, for a childrens book, it had too many words I had to look up. Then I would have to reread a few paragraphs to get the meaning."
5,Exellent Book,This book is great the begining is slow but the book is great it is full of secrets and interest. All the villians in the story get wats coming to them.
2,This book is OK!,I thought that the last 4 pages of the book where better than the rest of the whole book. This book could be a lot shorter and I wasn't to amazed by it.
3,Tangerine,"Paul Fisher,12-year-old, moved from Houston to Tangerine, Flordia. Paul wears thick glasses because in kindergarden he looked into a solar eclipse. He is being ignored by his parents and tormented by his older brother Erik. Erik is a high school football star. Erik gets all of the attention from their parent. Paul's parents don't pay attention to him because their either to busy with Erik or their jobs. But, now Paul is hanging out with the toughest group in school, the soccer team.I like this book and believe everyone should read it. I liked it because it show that even though bad things happen to you could still be happy.I think a good activity would to recreate the scene where Paul losses his vision. You could use twizzelers as people cream as spray and a graham cracker as the wall."
3,"let me recommend better books of this sort, TRUST ME!","Well first off the whole concept of Tangerine is incredibly cliche. I mean, a boy who's vision was seriously impaired in a tragic accident, yet he still sees better than most people. How touching. No actually I'm sure my view is slightly biased as I read it for school and that automatically makes it lower on my list. But overall it is most definetley a children's book. If you want something like this but MUCH better, try A Mango-Shaped space or Stargirl or even Dancing on the Edge or Born Blue by Han Nolan. If you are way beyond any of these type books I would recommend Perks of being a Wallflower and Sloppy Firsts and Second Helpings. Sorry to be so irrelevant but seriously, i'm no crazy person who inexplicably hates good books. I just have high standards and this one did not measure up. SO READ THOSE BOOKS! :)"
4,Jordan Weatherholtz,"This book is about a boy named Paul Fisher.He has an older brother named Erik Fisher.Paul Fisher moves to a subdivision called Lake Windsor Downs in Tangerine county.Tangerine County is in Florida.Paul starts at the school called Lake Windsor Middle.Something happens while he is goin there and he gets two choices to go to Lake Windsor At a late time, or go to Tangerine Middle.Paul decides to go to Tangerine Middle so he can get another chance to play soccer for a middle school team.Erik has a friend named Athur Buarer.Athur and Erik get in a fight with one of Paul's best friends brother Luis Cruz.Athur hits Luis with a black jack and then Tino Cruz wants to get back at Athur.Paul also wants to get back at Erik.This book is a very good book to read for someone in middle school."
3,Not very good,This was a mildly interesting book but mostly it was boring. The characters were pretty dumb and it was hard to care about them. It's easier to make fun of them instead of taking their side and wanting them to succeed.
4,Misleading,"This is a warning for people who reley on the back and the first few chapters of a book. The first half of the book is extremely different then the second half. The back is misleading altogether. It seems that the author wrote the back and the first half with some dark, magical, demonic conspericy going on. The second half gives no explenation to the phenominal events, such as underground fires and litening with a tendency to hit people, and his best friend becomes a jerk abruptly. In the second half, it becomes more of a mystery novel, with Paul trying to figure out why he lost his eyesight, and his friend returns to being a saint. It is a good book though, besides these flaws."
5,"Breath-taking, Heart-stopping...","Tangeringe by Edward Bloor is a book that you want to keep on reading, but you are some what afraid of the strange events that might take place next. At some points, I felt like my heart stopped because of the emotions that tear you apart. This book is full of mysterious and wonderous episodes. Tangerine is exeptional for pre-teens and up,but not limited."
1,R rated Book,"This book was a required reading assignment for my 7th grade son. It gave him nightmares and every time he thinks about the book a year later it makes him physically shudder and hold his stomach. If books had a rating system like movies do the violence and intensity of this book should earn it an R rating.In addition to the violence and horror, the book has absolutely no literary value. It does not contain layers waiting to be peeled back. It does not include beautifully crafted language. There are no symbols to understand. It has no historical value. This book is graphic violence for the sake of graphic violence. It is engaging and will hold you captive to the end, but you will not come away from reading this book a better person. You will have learned nothing, nor will you have grown in any way. This book is repugnant, and should not be required reading at any level."
1,one of the worst books,"i am an eighth grade student and we read this book together as a class. It was so boring and didn't have a catchy story-line. You couldn't relate to anything in this book because everything bad happened. Out of now where people would die and Paul would get the blame for it. I don't recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read. Even if your teacher suggests this book to you, do not waste your time reading it."
5,More than you would expect from a sports novel.,"I really loved this book. it was a mixture of sports (socer, my favorite) and drama. Best of all nobody named Ken or Dawson had to solve the mystery of the missing snowboard before the slopes were shut down for good (that being the plot of a regular sports book)"
3,It's an O.K book.,"I read Tangerine a few weeks ago for a book report, and I thought that it's cool how Paul, the main character, even wearing thick glasses, fits in in the toughest group around. But I think that it should finish differently, because it leaves you feeling blank."
4,exciting and surprising,"Tangerine is a very surprising book! It has many parts were you think you would want to be there. Paul has big glasses and a brother that needed to stop getting into trouble before it was too late for him and he got a little out of control just like what happened in the story. Paul is a kid that i wouldnt want to hang around with becuase he has big glasses and finds his computer his best friend. Thats pretty sad and his brother is popular so i can understand why erik doesnt want to hang out with him. At the end of the story Paul gets Erik back for the bad things that happened to him that were his fault, which i found the best part of the story plus Paul doesnt have the best of luck either in the end of the story though. Good book overall and I hope other people like it too!"
4,Tangerine,"I think that the book Tangerine was a pretty good book. Ifinished before everyone in the class. Its about Paul who is trying tofind out about his brother Erik. In, the mean time weird things are happening, like stealing things from bug infested houses that no one has acsess to. Paul has a few leads but nothing really good. Will he find out in time?"
3,Weird,"I thought Tangerine was a weird book. The book started off very good, and I thought it would end up being one of my favorites, but the ending was lacking and incomplete. The plot was okay. The characters were well developed, which I liked. The setting played an important role in the so-so plot. I found it difficult to find a theme in this story. I thought, that overall this book was okay, but I definitly wouldn't bother to waste my time reading it again, nor do I really recommend you read it."
4,"Twisted plot, unpredictable, great for reluctant readers","This book shows how one boy with a disability gains courage and becomes friends with the most ""unfriendly"" group of kids in junior high. Also shows the unusual relationship between Paul and his brother, Erik. You'll be amazed at how his brother treats him. Shows how families that are picture-perfect are nowhere near perfect. Also teaches how the truth can set you free. I loved it and I know junior high students everywhere will love it too."
3,Dark,"Tangerine is read by many middle school classrooms. The relationships between the characters, including family members, is very dark. It has a strong message about social class, but a negative one about individual needs and the IEP."
4,Lessons to be learned,"Good read! Different aged readers will see this book on different levels, much like Catcher in the Rye. An 11 year old reader will not get the same message as an adult, but both will enjoy the book. It's a page turner. Provides insight into the conflict between brothers and the parents who refuse to deal with the troubled child."
4,Wild for tangerine,This book is awesome! I read it in middle school and it was so funny that I laughed out loud. I think any middle school student would like it.
4,One of the best books on Wicca today...,"I must admit, I've never read any other books by this author, but I found this book to be helpful on more than one occasion! Some of her ideas are somewhat off-the-mark my my eyes, but one of the true lessons of Wicca is to question everything!! :o) Excellent book."
1,If I could leave a zero rating I would.,"This is by far the worst book I have ever read on the craft. With such falsities as wicca being an ancient matriachal religion, and that wicca is goddess based, it is a wonder this hasn't gotten worse reviews. I have read books by this author before and enjoyed them, but if you are looking for a good book about wicca I would suggest Cunningham's guide for a solitary practitioner. When you get past the intorduction about the craft and get into the rest of the book, such as nature spirits and other invisible helpers, and the book of spells the content is more barible, but not deffinatly not worth the price of this book. If you are still interested take a trip to you local book store and read a few sections before you buy it. I wish I would have."
5,Wicca,"I have many books and only a few that can be considered ""complete guides."" This one tops my list for a reference. I refer back to it a lot. It's permanently on my Wiccan library until I reach for it, which is often. It doesn't explain everything, but it has more than usual Wiccan books. I absolutely love it.)O("
5,Good book,"As usual, I bought this book after borrowing it from the library (this is the way I do ""book reviews"". Generally any book I buy from Amazon will rate 4-5 stars, or I wouldn't have bought it in the first place! This book has easily understood information and a great quantity of it. It also covers a few things that aren't covered in any of my other books on this subject. A must for any Wiccan's library."
4,Good...enough said,"This book is good for everything. It tells you what you need, what you have to do, and when is the best time to do it. I really enjoyed this book and how well it explans everything."
2,Myst 5: End of Quality,"I had high hopes for this game after the great ones like Exile URU, and Revelations. However this was not the case,First: The Audio SUCKED so bad, you might as well stick your head in a toilet flush and hope you enjoy it.Second: The biggest let down was the increadable lack of exploration and lengh in each level/age. The associated puzzles were so weak unlike the complex levels in URU and RIVEN.Third: The realizm was not there, The characters were well intigrated in past games but in the final game they used all digital! Didn't have that real life feel.Over all I am a Dissapointed Myst Lover. If you purchase this dont spend to much. It just lacks all the Length and Dificulty associeated with past games like Revelations/Riven.OH YAH THERE ARE NOT ANY FUN RIDES AND A LACK OF BUTTONS TO PUSH, BORRING!"
4,exactly what I expected.,"They're black. They work. There's a bunch of em. Could have been a touch cheaper, but they definitely serve their purpose. Cables are cleaned up and airflow is improved. You'd be surprised how much nicer you can make the inside of your pc look with a little clever thinking, some effort and a pair of cable cutters."
5,Extensive Translations from Ibn Arabi's Mekkan Revelations,A highly significant contribution to Islamic studies in the area of sufism in particular. Extensive passages from Ibn Arabi's Futuhat al-Makiyya have been translated into a European langauge for the first time by one of North America's leading Islamicists.Highly recommended.
4,Another must have in the collection,"Another great recording from a guy who breathes musical integrity. Bassist Kevin Vecchione plays some great lines with great tone. His bass solo on ""3 toad sloth"" is melodically and rhythmically worthy of acclaim as is his playing throughout the rest of the recording. Another great feel good rock/fusion output from one of my favorite guitar players. Greg always continues to evolve with his new recordings, this one is no exception. Still wondering why he doesnt go with real drum sounds but the tone is better than his other offerings. Fresh, inspiring, and motivating. A+"
1,What a lemon,"The video card looked good for my agp based motherboard that i didnt want to replace yet. So i bought it thinking best video card for agp. Then i slowly realized that many people were saying it was buring out and that it didnt work well. Well i though i would take a chance on mine. So i recieved and installed the drivers which are xfx. Little did i know that on the same day it would burn out. DO NOT BUY, stick with Nvidia 7000 series or just replace motherboard for pci-e."
1,It was good for the four weeks it lasted,"I had one of these. It was a pretty good card -- great for AGP -- for the first four weeks I had it. Then it burned out (literally). I didn't overclock it, the power supply was 470 watts, and the old AGP card worked fine when I reverted to it. So, beware. Maybe it's a fluke, but I'm not inclined to buy another one.There is also some difficulty with the drivers -- you can't use standard NVidia drivers with this card, but have to use the XFX drivers instead. This is supposed to change in a future ""major rev"" of the NVidia drivers, but in the meantime, it means it takes a little longer to get updates."
2,Almost a comedy,"As a big Tarpon fishing fan (after a recent trip to Islamorada, FL) I guess I expected more fish catching and less people watching. The entire video was filled with talking and laughter. I thought if you wanted to catch fish, you were supposed to stay a little on the quiet side."
4,A must-own for any fan of garage noise,"Really, the title says it all. Noisy, sloppy, and unabashedly rock n roll. If you like the Drags, you'll like this."
5,"CLASSIC ""GOTAHAVEIT"" PIECE OF HIP HOP HISTORY...","First off, i had a few of malcolm mclaren's classic joints on tape, and 12"" for years....and i've been meaning to get my hands on this, on a cd format. This,if no body knows about the raw start of hip- hop into main stream music is the TRUTH..!!

5,"Nostalgia Reigns, Reviewed","We old-time tail-dragger pilots cannot pass a J-3 Cub without looking it over. If you have not flown in one, you should, just to appreciate the machine. Wheeler has put together a nostalgic story told by the Cubs themselves with their pilots referred to as ""humanoids"". The story involves the kind of flying we all dream about; namely, flying from grass field to grass field, camping under the wing, and doing it again the next day. Many humorous flying situations are told to the reader, with the ""humanoids"" often taking the brunt of the humor. Modern pilots who fly with ""glass"" instrument panels and funny-looking individual landing wheels on the front of their aircraft may not appreciate the tale, but those pilots who have been trained in slow tail-draggers will enjoy it."
2,Krokus - 'Round 13' (Angel Air),"So-so 1999 effort by the '80's Swiss rockers we know as Krokus. 'Round 13' isn't really a bad CD, but it's simply difficult to imagine Krokus existing without vocalist Marc Storace. His replacement is Carl Sentance (of Persian Risk, a metal band from Cardiff, UK)) and he isn't all that great in Storace's place. Only tunes here I thought were decent are ""Money Back"", ""Suck My Guitar"" and their direct AC/DC rip-off ""Witch Hunt"" (oddly enough, perhaps the best track of this entire release). Rest of the line-up includes is sole original member Fernando Von Arb-guitar, Many Maurer-bass, Chris Lauper-guitar and Peter Hass-drums. Pretty much reserved for die-hards."
3,not there best but pretty good,"Krokus was one of my favorite bands back in the mid 80's.Than being said this cd doesn't match what they did in there hayday.I mean really, suck my guitar how much cheesier could you get.But there are some good moments also such as heya,break free and gypsy love .Definately worth a listen but not one of there best efforts that is for sure."
2,STUDIO GANSTA,"I THINK THIS ALBUM WAZ HELLA WEAK, DIS FOOL'S ONLY A STUDIO GANSTA. I BET IF HE CAME 2 THA TOWN HE'S GET JACKED. HE CAN'T DO IT NO MO', HE'S JUST WEAK. AND ALSO, THE ONLY GOOD SONG ON DIS ALBUM IS GHETTO VET, AND DAT'S NOT EVEN DAT GOOD. IF U WANNA GET A GOOD ALBUM, DON'T GET DIS OR THA PEACE ONE, I HEARD DAT 2. IT WAS EVEN WEAKER. A WORD OF ADVISE, DON'T GET DIS ALBUM."
4,War on the Masses,"Ice Cube is the embodiment of Gansterism. He's OG now and it shows. He has been a player in the game for over 10 yrs now. I don't care if he's Don Mega or Cube, he's the hardest hitter. Ghetto Vet symbolizes the albums meaning...Still in the game no matter what. With first of two CDs, Cube proves he ""Pushes Rhymes Like Weight"".Peace, Damn Straight"
4,Good album from Cube,"This album is better than I expected. I didn't expect it to be that good seeing as though it wasn't very famous. I recommend you to buy this album, if you don't have it already."
2,Not up to Ice Cube's standard,"Compared to most other hip-hop albums out there, this CD is good. However, Ice Cube's old stuff is his worst enemy: He can't compete with ""America's Most"" or ""Death Certificate"". Cube's lyrics used to be about reality. Now there all silly tales about how much loot he's got. I think Cube tried too hard on this album."
4,Good Cd but not his best work,I just bought War n Peace and i think it is very good and i enjoyed it but it wasn't his best cd. I Still recomed everyone buys it :)
2,Incredibly dissapointing.,"This album sounds like one continous song with a few breaks. There is absolutley nothing redeeming, entertaining, or original on this album. I believe that Ice Cube's previous endevours have had an incredibley positive infulence on Rap music. This falls far short of that however. Whatever happened to ""funky""? This album almost sounds like Ice Cube sat down with a drum machine, found a beat that he liked, and then wrote some songs, put them all to that same beat, and made an album. Not to mention his lyrical style is incredibly flat. Sounds like he is trying to sound like 2-pac on every single song."
5,ICE CUBE'S STILL GOT IT GOING ON,ALL THE SONGS ON HERE ARE AWESOME EXCEPT FOR A FEW LIKE GHETTO VET. SO GET WAR AND PEACE RIGHT NOW.
2,I'm sorry I must have bought the wrong cd,Is this the same man who was one Amerikkas Most Wanted? I don't think so. This cd is pure garbage just like everything he's put out since Lethal Injection. The only thing decent he's recently done is Children of the Korn and that wasnt even on his album. The man has totally lost it. Whats up with those dumb a@# interludes thats pretty sad that u gotta put 10 seconds of Master P talkin nonsense to sell your album. If you have 15 dollars to blow give it to a bum instead of buying this.
1,totally wack,this album is wack when i heard it.i wasnt surprised some people are dissapointed im not i know cube has gotten wack.he doesnt know who he is one minute he's a gangsta another minute hes a party man.the album looks like a halloween album with him holdin a cane cube is wack his skills is wack the titles to his songs are wack like do the math baby. the peace album better be good or else it aint goin platnum.i know thats why he called back the peace album so he could work on it some more.hes wack baby wack wack wack wack wack
1,"ooh, cold like a bath in winter","mmm......... wipe my arse with a screwdriver and push an l.e.d. in it go to trevology, boy!"
5,War and peace vol.1,"If you are a true Ice Cube fan you""ll want this in your collection.He comes with a mixture of old and new style Cube and doesn't miss a step.It's one of his best!"
2,This CD is garbage,"I am a die hard Cube fan from the NWA days and I would have to say that I'm very disappointed with Cube's War disc! After the great Westside Connection CD and Players Club single ""We Be Clubbin"" I expected great things from this CD and was highly disappointed. It seems as though Cube tried to go cartoonish ala George Clinton but it didn't work in the least with his character Don Mega. I believe Cube put his best foot forward as he always does but it just didn't work out. He needs to and probably will scrap the Peace Vol. and reevaluate how he makes his come back."
4,If you don't like it I guess you just don't get it,"Ice Cube's latest recordings get some heavy criticism, both by fans of the Hip-Hop icon and those that dislike the man. His new albums don't sound much like Ice Cube's earlier masterpieces 'Amerikkka's Most Wanted' or 'The Predator', but you can't expect that the guy who's largely responsable for the evolution of rap-music to become a copy-cat of himself. The new albums (War and Peace) are great (like most, the War disc is my favourite too) and both lyrically and musically Ice Cube is evolving himself."
4,Agressive. Cube is still strait up wicked.,"A decade into this rap game, Cube still delivers the goods with ""War"". Always with an opinion to voice, he takes a stab at the three strikes rule and has one of his most blazing joints with... Korn? Crazy, but it is one of the illest joints on the LP. It's good to hear Cube at full speed, but we get the sense of been there, done that. But while some of his beats lag, his words remain razor sharp. And that put's him above a heavy portion of MCs today."
5,Don't listen to tha playa hatas.,"This album is an epic, especially ""War and Peace"" and ""Ghetto Vet."" A must get for the true rap fans."
2,It seems like a fast put together album,"This long awaited album to me was not focused to his true fans. The beats are weak and it definitely doesn't rock parties nor can you bump it in the trunk. Its hard for a MC to come out with a album in awhile bacause the times are changing. Like Public Enemy when they were at their peak, stop making songs. Todays age of hip hop is totally different. Our so called old school rappers have lost their grip on the audience. ICE CUBES grip was when he use to grap the audience with beats of the streets and lyrical skills that a have you thinking. .""As a fan I wish that he be the best MC and lead because he's been in the game longer than these new jacks and these new jacks need somebody to lead them."
4,The cd is good but lacks a somthing.,I think the cd is pretty good. It has a good balance of bass drops and it flows pretty good. But I think that it is missing the big song.
4,Meditative background or ethnomusical religious music,"Okay - Amazon's sense of geography has me baffled. Under the category of ""Various Artists - International - Africa"" one finds this album from New Guinea ... last time I looked at a map Africa didn't extend to South Sea Islands or, if you prefer, Southeast Asia. But once you get past the geography, this 2nd volume of Sacred Flute Music From New Guinea is fascinating. The music is played on two large, transverse, bamboo flutes with percussion. The coordination between the flutes is especially interesting as they frequently alternate rather than play in harmony. The notes accompanying the cd are excellent - detailing the instruments and the cultural context of playing them. My first reaction to the cd was mild boredom as there is comparatively little variation in tempo or pitch ... but my appreciation quickly grew to enjoying the quiet, ""natural"" and expressive sounds of the instruments."
4,I have to disagree with the less than good reviews....,"I would like to give this CD 5 stars (lets face it there were so many better records made at the time that are simply classic), but I always remember Wreckless Eric with fond memories. In the late 70's, I found a brown vinyl 10"" EP burried in the back of my local record store on Main Street (remember those things?). I discovered Wreckless Eric, finding his vocals and music facinating. I subsequently bought all the vinyl released by him and just recently while filling my new Zune, I decided I had to add him. Eric created a raw, pub room pop that I could just envision at a local pub in seedy inter-city section of England in 1979. I know Wreckless Eric could never have been a top of the charts kind of artist, but for a raw pop sound that is just down right great to listen to, the late Wreckless one is worth spending a couple of bucks."
2,"The most talentless of the ""punk/new wave"" scene","Coupla good songs - the rest is beneath mediocre. Should be a one-star album, but raised a notch based on the label's sense of humor.....""greatest stiffs"" indeed.The two good songs on this compilation can be found on much better punk-era various artists collections."
5,"land of mik&honey, sugar & spice..","a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, electro-latino-anglo cd...with some acoustic sounds (ie percussion, horn & string instruments) thrown in the audio blender. It really purrrs along nicely. Smooth playing, lyrics, also uptempo sometimes. cant drive or relax to. It was really a pleasure to listen to."
5,Strongly recommended reading,"Pascual Duarte grew up in brutal and brutalizing poverty, hatred, depravity, and despair. From his prison cell where he is awaiting execution for a series of murders he has committed, Duarte writes down his confessions and in doing so, depicts the horrors of his life, foremost among which are a despicable mother, an unfaithful wife, and a lifetime of savage crimes. Duarte's account (written with a hauntingly childlike sense of the world) portrays a man twisted by the cruel hand of fate into a source of contributing evil. Strongly recommended reading, The Family Of Pascual Duarte is a unique and flawlessly written novel by the late Camilo Jose Cela (1916-2002) and will admirably serve to introduce a new generation to the work of this deftly talented author of more than fifty books during his lifetime."
3,The Family of Pascual Duarte Review,Book was a good read. It was far different from anything ever read but was required for me. Was a strange but interesting book about a very hard life of a common turned crazed man.
1,Kathy,"probably the most unredeeming book I've ever read...just awful, a waste of time, even though it's short"
5,swear by this stuff!,"I am into non-medicinal care as much as possible. I don't do well with all sorts of prescribed medicines; last go around caused my immune system to crash and I was a long time in rebuilding it. When you find something that works so well with simple herbs you are delighted. Gypsy Cold Care isn't bad tasting. Sort of a twiggy with a strong mint-type flavour. Only who cares what it takes like! This stuff works for me. At the first hint of a cold or sore throat, I brew a pot and drink it. Generally all the cold symptoms just fade away in just a few hours. I have recommended it to dozens of friends and it works well for them, too.So if you are looking for all natural alternatives, you might consider this the next time you feel a cold coming on. I keep it on hand all winter."
5,Great Stuff,"This tea is amazingly effective. If you have a cold and want to breathe, get some. Hard to find in local grocery stores."
4,A fair value,"While the older product was better, this is a fair adaptation and does serve to give relief during the cold season."
5,Works and tastes great!,Love the taste and helped me feel better when I had a cold. I'm convinced it shortened my cold. Recommended!
4,pile driver,"The shirt arrived on time before the expected date. Quality good , in all very good service. It matched the description on the website."
4,New school and Old school collide,Kevin Seconds from the world famous 7 seconds and Matt Skiba from the soon to be world famous Alkaline Trio meet head to head for the first time. I like this cd a lot i agree that SKibbs' writing is not up to par with what i'm used to from him but its a decent effort. Kevin Seconds actually blew me away i had zero expectations and he surprised the hell out of me. If you don't like old school punk rock then you will hate it but if you're open minded then you'll love the whole cd and won't have to stop it when Skibbs' songs are over.
3,good matt skiba,"skiba's really good on this cd, and kevin seconds is okay i guess. but a bad thing about it is the sound quality. sometimes it's pretty bad."
4,half of your money,"Like previously said, Matt Skiba is worth buying this record for. He makes these heart felt songs that you can truly get into. Kevin Seconds seems to have thrown some songs together, or at least I hope so. It would be a shame for someone to actually spend a tangible amount of time writing terribly obvious rhyming songs to go with crappy music. I've never heard Alkaline Trio but I might have to after this one. I can't imagine Kevin Seconds has a band or one worth listening to anyway. It would be five stars if you could somehow scratch the CD in a way the first five songs are only playable."
4,youre wrong,"I've read a couple of reviews of this album at multiple websites, and it seems I am the only person out there who enjoys the kevin seconds side of this record a lot more than matt skiba's. Matt skiba's side strikes me as whiny, sad, alkaline trio without the distorted guitar, while Kevin Seconds's side is just great music to sit around and listen to. I can play Kevin Seconds's songs repeatedly, but Matt Skiba's quickly get boring and run together. All in all, i think it is a great album, mainly because Kevin Seconds is so damn good."
3,"Fine, but not a biography","The title is misleading, since this book is NOT a biography of the French New Wave director, but instead a thorough analysis of his films. It should have been called ""The Films of Francois Truffaut."" Professor Insdorf makes clear the connections among Truffaut's films. Many of those connections are quite surprising, and will deepen your appreciation of the films. Also, this book is the last word on Truffaut's influences. Professor Insdorf's description of the director's marriage of the Hitchcock sensibility with the lyricism of Jean Renoir is magnificent. This is a fine companion to the director's films, but the biographical data -- about Truffaut's youth and film criticism -- is perfunctory. And there is precious little on Truffaut's interaction with other French and world filmmakers."
4,the evolution of tony macalpine,"Though this is not the best effort of Mr. MacAlpine, but stil he play the best ever. The standard of Mr MacAlpine playing is not quiet different from last Mr. MacAlpine album, Especially the Mr MacAlpine Piano Playing. In certain way i think there's such a good new direction musical influence, and that is the evolution, fusion. Mr. MacAlpine try to push the boundaries from neo classical to the different style. This album has great mixture neo classical thing and jazz, and the result is just good, not kind of boring album. If you die hard fans of Mr. MacAlpine shredding music, you should listen to this one. And You'll find out What is ""The Evolution"" of Mr. MacAlpine."
5,One of the best new sounds to come around in ages!,"Hard to describe, easy to enjoy. You'll be impressed and delighted with the wide range of rythms nad lyrics that ""Donna the Buffalo"" brings to its music. This is simply one of the best new groups to come along in some time. I was truly amazed when I saw them in concert and their CD,""Rockin' In the Weary Land"" is one of the first I reach for when I get in the car (where I spend a lot of time). Even my 13 year old fights to have the CD in her room, quite an endorsement.Not surprisingly, the band seems to be catching the interst of the public, but is still something of a mystery on the radio play-lists. Too bad, for the rest of the world. This is a band that has a lot to look forward to, no ""one-hit"" future here. If they are in your area, see them . . .you'll smile all the way home."
4,Good Stuff,"This album makes me feel good. The only reason I dont give it 5 stars is that I would love to hear Tara Nevins sing all the songs. The others do very good, but I love her voice and her song writng.Don't compare it to the Grateful Dead or the String Cheese Incedent. Love it for its own merits."
2,Herd Festival?,"It's hard to criticize a band whose songs are as obviously heartfelt as Donna The Buffalo's--an amalgam of country, zydeco and roots rock. There is some great guitar playing, moments of grandeur, a handful of mildly entertaining songs, and quite a lot of filler. I haven't decided if ""Funky Side"" is the catchiest song I've heard in a while, or the most annoying. A lot of the songs (Funky Side, for example) suffer from repetition---after the first 2 minutes you've pretty much heard the whole song. ""Each & Every Direction"" is a good song to groove to, but there's not much of a melody. Not bad overall...but hardly overwhelming. To be fair, I can envision myself buying another Donna The Buffalo CD. It's just not something I would listen to a lot."
5,Sets the groove to keep on pushin' you through!,"This album is so much fun to listen to....it has heart, soul and an accordian! I can't wait to see these guys live- I bet they put on one hell of a show."
3,Headed for a Heartbreak,I must admit that I loved this song for the sound of the guitar and the lyrics.It brings back nostalgia of growing up in the late 80's and early 90's.It was a time when musicians actually played thier own instruments and sang at the same time.I am glad that I found it on Amazon.com.
4,An Excellent Companion Book,"Not only a companion to the BBC series of the same name, the book contains plenty of extra information about prehistoric animals not found on the show, as well as extra illustrations and charts. Though it is certainly not a comprehensive lists of ice age animals (or even so-called ""monsters"") contemporaneous with man, it does touch on perhaps the most significant of them, and contains detailed descriptions of many creatures not usually explored by books with similar themes.Especially recommended for illustrators of prehistoric themed art and for the layperson who is looking for an enjoyable read to learn about man's early interaction with extinct (and often terrifying) animals."
2,Very poor reprint !,"Subject matter is wonderful; however, this University of Michigan reprint for $26.99 suffers from a lack of quality control. The reproduction process results in a very faint printing reminiscent of the days of early photocopies in the 1960's ! YIKES !!! Surely, modern print technology can produce better . We returned our copy which had blank pages, offset images, and charts not even readible using a microscope.SAVE YOUR MONEY !!! Wait for a better product that you can actually read !"
2,not what it sais it is,"the discription and pic all say it comes with a stand but it does not it only comes with a tub with wheels you can atach, which works i guess but i already had another cage that did have the base and i was going to hook them together and so when i got the first cage i ordered it didn't have the stand so i asked for a replacement because it didn't have a stand and they don't even look at the reason that you want a replacement cause they sent me another one just the same without a stand uhhhh so now all is going back and i have to start all over again.Good product just need to be aware that it isn't what they say it is..."
2,Not the best cage ever.,"Its a decent size and gives your pet lots of room to play. The design make it very hard to leave without taking completely apart, and as you know ferrets are very messy eaters so you have to clean it a lot. The plastics of the cage aren't very strong, and even a small ferret will cause it to bend and deform."
5,chinchilla cage use,THIS IS A GREAT CAGE FOR ADULT CHINCHILLAS. FOR BABIES THE BARS WOULD HAVE TO BE A HALF INCH APART....BUT THE SET-UP GIVES THEM SOMETHING TO DO AND THE BOTTOM IS ABOUT 4 INCHES DEEP....WHICH CANT BE FOUND IN SIMILAR CAGES.
3,Good cage but...,"I ordered this cage because my chinchilla recently broke her foot so I had to get something with ramps to compensate for her. It's a great cage but the plastic is a little flimsy. The floors and slide bend easily. The ramp and elbow tube are fine. I had to put a wooden dowel under the middle floor to keep them even. I ended up throwing the slide out and ordering another ramp and floor from superpetusa.com to make one complete level in the middle just in case she fell from the top level. Of course with a little modification to the floor (I had to grind the little clips off). After I added this middle level, extra ramp, and added the extra support under the level it's a great cage. But at almost $100 the plastic should be a better quality."
5,Chinie Love hes new home,This is a really great cage. I have a chinchilla that loves it. Set up was fast and easy and holds together great. Prefect size all the way around. This is a most have cage for your pets and the price was just right.
1,Good size but thats about all it has going for it.,"The cage is perfect size. My ferret loved the room to run around it in. But first thing to fall apart was the slide. I dont know who they are kidding but it doesn't seem designed to hold the weight of a ferret at all. The slide was no big deal, after about the 5th time of it falling apart I just took it out and my ferret could still get to top easy enough. The real problem is how thin the bars are and how easy they bend. My ferret chewed a corner loose and bent the bar enough that she could slip through. Two times we came home to find the ferret running around our place with the cats. We were thankful the cats didnt eat her."
2,NOT FOR SUGAR GLIDERS,"I found this cage while searching for a cage for my sugar glider. I was excited when it came. We got it assembled and ready to put our glider in his new cage. We put him in and within 2 minutes he was out,so we put him in again and back out he came. This cage should not be listed under sugar glider cages.They can fit right through the bars."
2,Our ferret died with this cage,"After looking around for a cage we chose this one based on the height to provide more space for our ferret. It is a bit cumbersome to get the shelves to into the cage and to stay latched to the cage. The sides of the cage hook together but are not very secure. Our ferret pushed through the sides of the cage where the sides did not stay hooked together. We were not home and so she was squeezed by the metal as she got only 1/2 way through. Therefore, she died. I would not recommend this cage due to the poor construction and safety implications."
3,Nice,"This item was fairly easy to assemble. Definitely requires at least two people for assembly or REALLY long arms. We received the item in good condition, except for the wheels were missing (we only got one in the package). We don't really move the cage much so it's not a big deal. The spiral ramp requires pegs to secure it in place, and one of the pegs broke. We made due with a metal screw. It really should have some support underneath, as the plastic is a little flimsy for full-grown rats. Overall, pleased with the product considering its price. Our rats enjoy having more area to climb!"
2,Definitely not worth the price tag,"I bought this cage as a first home for my ferrets. The bars are very flimsy and the doors latch by forcing the latch in between two bars. As you can imagine after a while the bars bend and even break. One broke at the very top of my cage and my ferret was able to climb the bars and escape. So many horizontal bars is a bad design for ferrets. And they hated the slide, would never use it. Would leap from one level to the next instead of dealing with it. I ended up purchasing two more of the tunnel elbows and removing the slide and ramp. They liked this a lot better. I finally upgraded to a Ferret Nation habitat. Hands down the best ferret cage on the market. Ramp covers for safety, removable plastic shelf inserts for easy cleaning, strong bars and dual lock doors."
3,Ok cage...,first off easy set up my butt. i got extremely frustrated trying to put this thing together. My little ferret couldn't figure out the slide and he ended up breaking it off. I personally think its hard to clean unless you take all the panels out and then have a hard time putting them all back in. its a really nice cage but maybe it wasn't the right type for me to get. And after about a week my ferret can just push open the doors on the front of the cage. but that is normal cuz there smart little guys.
2,Cage Doors too small,"This cage is plenty large enough. BUT. Its extreamly hard to clean, and the ledges that come with it easily get poo stuck into the little ridges (Meant to keep urine in I think) I cleaned that cage every other day, and eventually just knew I had to get a new cage. This here:[...]Is a much better product for my rattie Girls."
2,Big cage for your buck - HUGE pain to clean.,"I was looking for a cage for our 6 female ratties, and the size is great! The down side is cleaning...we ended up taking the slide out, it just was too much of a problem to put back on after every washing...the purple shelves are a BIG pain to clean (they ""snap"" back on - and it's not easy - awkward and bulky). If you do have adolescent rats (2 to 3 months old), they will be able to squeeze through the bar spacing -- we had to elevate ours off the floor on a large end table, so they couldn't get to the floor below. All in all, it's alot of cage for your buck. It has spurred us to get a Critter Nation cage though. The cleaning issue is just a big one with this cage."
2,Not good for Sugar Gliders,If you are looking at this for a sugar glider beware. The slats are a little too far apart and small gliders can easily crawl through the bars. We purchased this to bring home our gliders and had to come up with something quick overnight because our female just slips right through the bars.
4,Rats,"Great cage for the price. Retail stores in my area have this around $130. Picked up from Amazon for around $80. Currently housing 3 rats (with a fourth waiting to move in) and they have plenty of room. Added an in cage wheel and some toys.Negatives- the rats pee and poop on the top level and it's a pain to clean. I've added a litter box since this started and it has gotten better. If your rats resist using the litter box, it could be frustrating.- rats can be pretty tough on the plastic ledges, ramps, tunnels if they are chewers. Expect to do some mending if you have a chewer.Positives- It's roomy. Alot of space to add toys.- It looks nice- Easy to move (wheels)- Affordable (I got it for around $80, you'll find a cage at petsmart half as big for the same price)"
1,Plastic bottom is a terrible idea.,"This cage is terrible. My two pet rats have lived in this cage for less than half a year and have already chewed a hole about 5'' by 3'' which, needless to say is easily large enough for them to fit through. I covered it with cardboard which they manage to chew off in one day. Another thing is that the ramps and tubes are so wobbly that my rats won't use them. They are also starting to chew through the bars. The first little platform is always covered in poop, seeds, and sunflower seed shells. It is a nightmare to clean because it falls apart and I had to zip-tie the corners together because there was a gap big enough for them to squeeze through. I would not recommend this cage to my worst enemy."
4,Good to start with ferrets,"I think this product is okay to start with when you first purchase ferrets. However, fair warning: mine knocked down the ramp, continuously chew on the different plastic pieces and try to take down the slide! lol (I have two 3 month olds, so this may be different for adult ferrets.) They also have fun climbing up the sides. I think eventually I will invest in the 2 story FerretNation cage everyone raves about. Not a bad cage for the price. Pretty easy to put together. However, I'm still not sure it's sturdy enough. :/"
1,Let me count the ways...,"I bought this as the first home for my two ferrets since it looked like something they would have fun in and it was a great price...*Cleaning the base of the cage is difficult unless you have very long arms...*Cleaning around the tube, ramp, and slide is next to impossible (I removed them after 2 weeks)*My ferrets have taken to using the shelves as their litter box... In fact for two days straight they used nothing but the shelves (those have now been removed as well)*Although they are only 1 and 2 pounds, they have successfully figured out how to get out of the cage and have bent the door bars. I have to make sure it is ""double locked"" before leaving the house.I wish I had spent a bit more money and bought a cage that was longer and not taller."
3,A pain to clean and move levels.,"I really dislike this cage. It looks nice, but you can't reach in to the clean the levels and so have to take out the levels, which is a real pain. The cage is functional and nice, but too difficult to clean, especially with ferrets who crap a lot and it NEVER DRIES! Ew... and more ew. This cage might be okay for other animals that don't crap so much. Just being honest. Oh, and it seems a bit small for ferrets. I have rats and it'd probably be okay for them, though still difficult to clean."
3,really am not happy,"for what i paid for this item i was not impressed at all, it wasnt even 2 days and the slide and stuff was broke, for the price of it i dont think it should have done that.I like the room of it and for a ferret but the plastic stuff was just not sturdy enough for a 7 month old ferret."
2,"Looks good at first, but cheaply made.","I like many others was looking for a cheaper ferret cage until I could save up for the FN cage. Don't buy this. While my female kit loves the slide and loves climbing the sides, the bars have snapped twice and I had to return it today for another one. The plastic is very cheap and I find it bending under her, and she's only 2 pounds. The tunnel doesn't fit in the spot it's supposed to, and my ferret is able to take off the secure clips on the side. All in all, it's not worth your money. Go for the more expensive cage. It's better in the long run."
1,Too hard to clean,"I have 2 ferrets to house in this cage. Meaning, I have to clean this thing frequently. Biggest pain in the ass I've ever dealt with. My ferrets are also stubborn and refuse to use a litter box and kick out any bedding I use, so all of their urine runs to the middle, so they get to hang out in their own smelly mess all day.When I finally muster up the will to clean this cage every 3 days, I have to fight with this thing.Also, they don't play on the ""slides"". They just rip them off the hinges and throw it into their waste."
1,Crap crap and more crap!,We bought this for our ferret and it would have been okay that it was so late if it wasn't so broken. Our box showed up and it was all dented and had looked like it had been thrown around. A wheel was broken right out of the box and we thought we could work around it but then we noticed that several of the latches where broken off. We couldn't even put it together! I'm sure that if it hadn't been broken it would have been a wonderful product but it was broken so it was crap crap and more crap. I hope our replacement is better then this one! Warehouse deals should pay more attention to the quality products they give there customers... Bad first impression and once we get this figured out it will be last!
3,Not for female rats,Do not get this cage if you have small or female rats. They can squeeze through the wires and escape.
3,Okay for the cost,"It was okay for the money, cheap plastic. The plastic slide doesn't stay together and quickly came out of the cage. The levels are hard to get in and out for cleaning. It takes me about 45 min to clean this cage. I only have one rat and this cage is a little on the big size for him. But would recommend for anyone with 2-3 rats. Purchase extra ladders and toss the slide, it's a waste."
4,Excellent cage - not for small rodents,"Excellent cage!! I bought this for my medium sized rats. I wouldn't recommend this for someone with smaller rodents because the wires are not close enough together. My ratties love their new home, and my kids and I are satisfied with our purchase!The only thing I was disappointed about is there was one wire that snapped off in one spot, but I super glued it back and it works. I think that with a larger rodent, they probably wouldn't fit through the tunnels because my medium rats just barely fit through comfortably."
1,Ouch!,"I was so excited when I purchased this for my two rats. Unfortunately when I received it, I notice the bar spacing was much larger than in the description, especially where they bent apart due to cheap materials and bad shipping. I tried to put it together anyway, trying to be optimistic that my rats wouldn't try to get out. I could not get the pieces together. The plastic on the slide would start to bend and just as I was about to actually get the pieces together they slipped and I scrapped my knuckle. So much for ""E-z directions"". I am now bleeding, though the nice thing was that it was much easier to take apart than put together.I DO NOT recommend buying this. EVER!!!"
3,Not the best in the world but ok.,"I bought this for my ferret, but as you can see from the picture, the set up is wrong. This is because the item we got seems to have a problem with the shelfs. It wouldnt even clip onto the cage right because the hole was in the wrong area, so they couldn't be put correctly. We had to adjust it to find a way to get them to work, and my poor baby can't even get to the top. The ladder going to the top story is very slippery and all it does is slide down making it impossible for it to get up there that way. He had to clime the entire cage to try to get up, which most the time he falls. I do plan on replaceing this as soon as possible with a much better cage. But for starters, it was a good deal. He also isn't a big fan of the slide. It does have a lot of room though."
2,No good for ferrets,"This cage is a very cheap cage. When we first bought this cage, we had two ferrets. It is very easy to set up, but the plastic is very easy to break. The ""slide"" broke while we were putting it together. The ladder was too steep for them to use (the ferrets were still really little at the time), so they just turned it into a toy. The cage itself kept coming undone in the corners. Also, one of the ferrets figured out how to unlatch two of the doors, the one on the roof of the cage, and the one in the middle. The shelves are bent from the ferrets standing one them, and they weigh maybe at the most 2 pounds. I did like the fact that it was easy to snap the cage off the bottom to change it, but the bottom has little latches, and those broke within the first couple weeks. Another thing I liked about the cage is that the bottom was deep enough for them to go to the bathroom and not get it every where.This probably would be a better cage for rats."
5,feedback,i received my super pet home and was more than pleased!!! the product is everythinf they said it would be. not much more i cna say other than i was very pleased with the item.
3,Great space but cheaply made,"I purchased this for my rats after reading many reviews. The price was reasonable and the space is great for my rats. I was disappointed in the cheap plastic - the tabs on the shelves were broken when I got it; the ladder doesn't correctly connect to the shelf; and many of the metal parts were slightly bent - and needed reshaped. Amazon was great in sending me a replacement, so I could replace the broken plastic parts - but even in the replacement they sent, one of the shelf tabs were broken. It is a PAIN to clean because there is not a sliding tray that comes out, and the entire top has to be removed. Normally I would not think this to be a problem - I imagined it similar to a hamster cage - but because of the size, maybe - or the poor quality of the structure, it does not come off easily. I would not re-purchase this same cage. I would shop around and maybe spend a few extra dollars on a different brand."
1,1 star is too much !!!!!!,"After a week my ferrets had the ramp and the slide broke. I figured they were cheap so I made my own, but after a month one of the plastic platforms buckled under their weight. I would NOT recommend this cage to anyone. It is a pain to clean and very cheap construction"
4,Very Nice For Chinchillas,"I love how there's wheels, and the surface area is 4 stories instead of really wide and long. Chins love to climb and hop, so this is great for them! The bottom keeps the bedding in nicely, and the shelves accessing the doors are really nice to say hello to your chinchilla - mine was trained to come out on the door when I opened it and I could pet him. It is the best cage to clean and to roll around for easy access."
1,Agreed: Cheap is Cheap.,"As most others have said, (which I wish I had read prior to purchasing), this is made with extremely cheap material. My slide was broken out of the box and I sent it back to the local pet store to replace. The ramp is a joke and neither stays on nor functions as a suitable walk-up ramp. I've had for one week and already the shelves are all sagging (she's just a baby ferret!!) I don't have a problem cleaning it out, but I haven't found a litter pan that fits correctly either. My ferrets just try to climb up to the shelves by vertically scaling the walls. We took out the ramp and slide and just use various hammocks now for them to walk from hammock to shelf to hammock to shelf. Save your money and buy one that will last. I'm already trying to figure out how to stabilize the shelves...after a week. Pathetic."
4,Awesome cage for my chinchilla,"First off, I bought this cage from Petco for $130.00 and was not happy to see that I could have gotten it from Amazon for $100 including shipping! I saw smaller cages with just simple ramps at the pet store for the exact same price of $130. My chinchilla seems to like the cage. The only thing is he won't go through the top of the slide. I simply hung his dust house next to the third level so he could jump on it to get to the level instead of going through the slide opening. My children and I enjoy watching the chinchilla in this cage and it is large enough that I could get a second chinchilla if I wanted. I like that it has wheels so I will be able to move it to vaccum. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because it looks like it's going to be a real pain to clean! Hopefully a litter box will make it easier. Also, why is this cage marketed only as a ferret cage when it is great for rats and chinchillas?"
1,Hard to clean,Had this cage since Dec. 2007. It's VERY hard to clean out. The only plus is that the doors lach good.
2,No Good for Ferrets,"I brought this home for my fuzzy, and I wish I'd gotten something else. The tunnel at the bottom is too small, so he ignores it, and the windy ramp thing on the 2nd level isn't sturdy at all. I've actually had to reinforce it so it stops wobbling when he steps onto it. Again, though, it's too small; he just uses it to step up to the next level and ignores the holes. I suspect this cage would work well for rats, since they're smaller, but save yourself the trouble if you're buying this for a ferret. I'd rather have simple ramps in the cage between the levels, and I can tell that my little guy agrees with me."
4,Great for Rats or Ferrets,"I looked all over for a cage with a decent size and price. I'd say this is the cheapest you'll find for one as big as this. I bought it for 2 ferrets and there was probably plenty of room for another. I couldn't connect the slide and my ferrets kept knocking the ramp down, but with strategic placement of the shelves they could get around fairly easily without them. Even though I had these issues its still a great cage for the price and I want to get another for my rats."
2,Not for rats,"Bought to be used with a pair of rats. Took a lot of assembly, wire gauge was ""eh"", hammock is tissue thin, and the rats spent the first few hours exploring the outside of the cage -- they fit right through the bars. Plastic was high quality and it's a huge cage. Too bad. The rattys are sleeping under glass tonight."
2,Not good,"At first glance, I loved this cage for my pet rats. It was recommended to me by a sales associate at PetsMart. First, my young rats could get through the bars!Second, the shelves don't stay where they're supposed to stay. They pop out of place.And cleaning the cage? Forget it. It takes forever to clean, the shelves pop out of place, and the top won't come off easily to clean the bottom.I promptly returned this cage and bought a Critter Nation Double."
2,Good size but not very convenient.,"I tried the SuperPet cages with ferrets and rats. While SuperPet models do offer a ton of space for your fuzzies, the design is just not user-friendly. The doors are very small and it can be tough getting access to all of your food dishes, hanging toys, and critters. The shelves have a little groove on the inside which tends to collect urine, kibble, and water. They do not unhook from the cage easily, so unless you wipe everything down before pulling it out, you're likely to scatter yuckiness everywhere.The cages are very heavy and awkward. Yes, you can unhook them from the bottom and clean them as two separate pieces, but getting both to a bathroom or outside for cleaning can be a real chore. They do offer a lot of customization possibilities, but the difficulty of moving things around and putting things back in after a cleaning are just not worth it. I'd rather get a Ferret Nation or a Martin's."
1,HORRIBLE,"my cage came missing the top piece so i had to destroy their old cage to use piece to make a top myself. Then after using this cage for three days all the levels were just pools of pee and poop i had to clean it 3 times a day or more. Now that i figured out how much i hate this cage, i already destroyed the otherone and threw it out so i had to go buy aother one just like my old one -_- THIS CAGE IS JUNK"
4,Great bones,"Because of the great price on Amazon, I was able to buy this cage knowing I would need to modify it. I have 2 chinchillas, and though I have seen this cage listed as a minimum size for 1 chinchilla, I believe that there is plenty of room for them both (they do get quite a lot of time to run around outside of the cage, too). The shelves that come with the cage are okay; the ramps/etc are pretty useless to chinchillas, aside from being plastic. Also, for me I found the shelves annoying because they have a dip around the edges that catches every piece of poo they leave behind. However, I have built wooden shelves to replace them for only about $20 all together and I couldn't be happier. Definitely would recommend this cage for chinnies if you aren't afraid of a little DIY."
3,"Ok, not great.","This was rather annoying to set up, and I never even figured out how to set up the ramp to the third level. You get what you pay for. An ok cage, but nothing that great."
3,Not great for Rats,"Overall the cage was easy to put together and seems very well made, but this is not a good cage for rats. I have 4 rats and they all can squeeze through the bars to get out, also, this cage is very difficult to clean. Impossible to just wipe down platforms without taking everything apart. I think it would be perfect for a larger animal who was completely litter box trained. But not great for messy small animals."
4,"Good price and size, cheap plastic.","I bought this cage for my chinchilla, and removed the cute little slide and ladders and such... it's a great size!!! Benjamin loves to jump around, climb around and just generally enjoy the space he has when he is in his cage. However, if you ARE thinking about buying this cage for a chinchilla (as I'm not sure if ferrets steps/jumps would have as much of an impact as a chin's) please keep in mind that the plastic that the landings are made of is pretty cheap, I've had this cage for about a month and if I put Ben's hidey home on any level, it sags. I'm happy with my purchase, and think it's well worth the money, but would suggest keeping the sagging plastic levels in mind. They seem strudy enough to last a while, but it gets kind of annoying to look at!"
4,Good for Rats.. Not for Ferrets.,This cage is like a mansion for my 2 rats. However it would not be good for ferrets. My rats are pretty large males and they bend the slide pretty severely when they run up it. It might break for a ferret (if the ferret isn't too big to even walk on the slide). The holes in the platforms are also probably too small for anything but a baby ferret. I highly recommend this cage for any rat owners but advise ferret owners to look elsewhere.
5,rat castle,This is by far the best rat cage I have ever purchased. The 4 mature rats that this was bought for acclimated immediately and easily to the various levels and features of this cage. And it was a cinch to clean as the entire cage part disconnects from the bottom so you can remove the dirty bedding quite easily. The wheels make it easy to move the cage to different locations as well. I highly recommend this cage!
2,Not for Ferrets,"I have two ferrets from a prior owner who had this cage and a Marshall cage. We decided to put this one in my boyfriend's house for when I visited. The cage really isn't for ferrets - they are fully grown and too big to go up or down the slide or through the tubes. One of them just climbs up the bars to get up and down. This is probably great for rats and hamsters and such, but definitely not for ferrets."
3,"Awesome Cage, Assembly Was Difficult","The actual cage once put together is awesome, however assembly was difficult. It took me (and then my husband) about 40 minutes to put this thing together. The plastic snap together pieces are very awkward and are tough to snap together. They don't like to stay together, and then putting the ramps and platforms in is quite gymnastic in nature, lol. But it is together, and it is solid. It is a lot bigger than we thought it would be and our 2 year old male ferret loves it! We had to take the slide part out and add a ramp from his old cage because he was just too big to fit up the spiral, but it is all good with modification. He is sleeping happily in his hammock now, enjoying his new home. The rollers on the bottom are a nice touch as well."
2,Too Small,The cage was in great condition and easy to put together for me but the size was really small for just one of my ferrets. The picture looks great on the box but I dont think its a good cage for ferrets. Every thing in the cage was just too small.
3,"Perfect size, but bad quality.","I bought this cage for my chinchilla. The cage is a great size, don't get me wrong. The only problems are that the attachements such as the slide and ramp aren't very sturdy and the peices get warped easily. The cage was bent when I got it, and the shelves are lop sided because of it. It's alright though, I had to replace them anyways because my chin kept chewing them. The cage itself is very good though. I recommend it."
1,Not for Rats!,"I bought this cage for two adult rats. The rats loved the cage. It was very spaciousand had tons of room for them to run around. After having the cage for a couple of weeks, the older rat, Samantha escaped from the cage two nights in a row. We tried placing cardboard around the edges of the top of the cage, Samantha got out again. We then tried to place wood blocks on the top of the cage because we learned she was squeezing between the bars at the top. This didn't work either. Samantha has escaped a total of ten times from this cage in the middle of the night. Several of the members of the family have been awaken in the middle of the night with the rat crawling on them. I wouldnt recommend this cage to anyone who has pet rats! Total waste of money! We have two large dogs in our house, which makes this cage completely unsafe for the rats. At any time of her escape our dogs could have ate our beloved pet rat."
4,A good book on Marxian economics,"I have been reading through Capital volume I and wondered if there were any good books (in English) on Marxian economics. Two of Paul Sweezy's works, Monopoly Capital and this book, Theory of Capitalist Development were recommended. This book is an explanation of Marxian economics - the economic theories of Marx and the work of his followers up until the 1940s when this book was written, and the various debates over his theories.It is a good book. One should know however that there are various schools of Marxian thought, and not every Marxist economist thinks Ladislaus Bortkiewicz solved the ""transformation problem"", if there is a transformation problem in the first place. In other words, this is a good book, but you should read other views of these ideas as well."
3,Something is wrong with the audio/video splicing or editing,"I tried this dvd out today. It contains two basic workouts and a mix of those two workouts. And, here is the issue. I believe the mix of workouts is accomplished by editing and splicing together pieces of the two main workouts. I say this because there were awkward stops/starts in the video and audio throughout the mixed workouts. I don't believe the dvd is malfunctioning. I just think it is a poor job of splicing and editing or whatever the technology is to mix up the workouts. I may return this item. I bought two other Coffey dvd's and will try them out in the next few days to see if there is a similar problem before making up my mind. Otherwise, the only annoying thing is that she tries to do her own audio instructions during the workout. I believe it works out better if the person/persons doing the workouts are not doing the talking. That way there is more flow."
4,Like this DVD,"I like this DVD. It provides a good workout. There is an option for a full body workout; however, it only has 1 set of each exercise. For a better workout with 2 sets each, I do the back/legs/chest workout then go right to the biceps/shoulders workout. It takes 60 minutes with the warm up."
5,Great workout,"I think Kelly is great. She is motivating and I love her smile. She's not cutesy/perky and she's not drill-seargant style either--just friendly and low key. My favorite workout (pre-mix) is the 41 minute full body, which I currently do with 10 lb dumbbells and will soon be moving up to 15. I highly recommend this dvd for women who want to add strength training days to their workouts but who don't have a gym membership or just don't like going to the gym. You can start out with smaller weights and work your way up to heavy, or you can switch from heavy to lighter depending on which muscles are being worked. I also recommend Rob Glick's weight training video (a little longer and a includes some faster/cardio like segments, but also uses a step)."
3,Kinda hard!,I was hoping for a middle-of-the-road weight tape and I found this one to be more strenuous than I had hoped.
2,30 minutes to fitness,"Was not what I was looking for, too many squats. It had looked to me like a weight workout, which was what I wanted, so much of what they do I cannot because of my knees. It was not for me."
5,Changing my body -- in a good way!,"I'm very impressed. The music is great, the moves are original and challenging, and Coffey-Meyer is engaging. I am seeing muscles where there haven't been any for awhile, and I've only been doing the workouts on this video for about a month, once or twice a week. Note that you probably don't want to combine the upper and lower body workouts in one session unless you are already in awesome shape."
1,Goddess Kali,"I bought this based on the good reviews. I bought it for the 30 minute all in one workout and it was awful. The woman looked incredibly masculine. The woman that was leading it didn't control her weights properly she was using her body to lift them rather than using muscle control and I didn't like the exercises she used with the leg behind. The girl in the back on the left with blondy/brown hair had much better form with all the exercises. The disc was scratched as well, so I sent it back. I did body building for 8 years doing 4 to 6 day split routines and cycling, swimming and running in between and even competed at one stage so I know what I like and this dvd was not it."
2,Not that thrilled,"I got the DVD and immediately found a type-o on the case. Not a good sign. The workout isn't my style. Maybe others would like it, but I will be selling it at my next yard sale."
3,5 stars for Kelly 1 for actual dvd,I am disappointed in the actual physical dvd. It seems to sort of get stuck in my dvd player or computer. I am scared to use it now! I really enjoyed the dvd the first time I did it. Kelly made some muscles ache I didn't know existed. It is a great dvd for anyone whether you are advanced or a beginner just choose the right weight for yourself. But unfortunately I don't recommend buying it since it may ruin your dvd player.
3,Taking a safe course.,"Arguably John West(currently with Royal Hunt)has some of the best pipes in biz these days.The songs collected here are reasonably decent;my only fear is that West's great voice is responsible for all of that.Another complaint is that,stylistically,this stuf has been done before,and better by bands like Deep Purple ."
4,Very tight cd,"This is a great cd to play at a party, or for just kickin it. Everlasting Bass is the best song on here(it's the reason I bought it), but the other songs I like on here are This Is For The Homies, Say It Loud, U Don't Hear Me Tho, Oldie But Goodie, Get Ready To Roll, Nobody Disses Me, and DJs & MCs. This is truly a great cd, so check it out!"
1,fraud,"The product description claims that small packages of gold, frankincense and myrrh are included with this paperback. The packages are not included and the book is a small hardback."
5,MARTY EST UN GÉNIE,"C'EST ALBUM EST INCROYABLE CTÉ MELODIE,MARTY EST TRES DOUÉ POUR COMPOSER DES LICKS ACROCHEUR AVEC SES GAMMES JAPONAISES ET ORIENTAL.IL EST UN PEU PLUS ROCK QUE LE PRÉCÉDANT MAIS JOUÉ AVEC BEAUCOUP D'ÉMOTION.MARTY EST UN VIRTUOSE DE LA GUITARE QUE JE RESPECTE ÉNORMÉMENT.SI VOUS VOULEZ UN ALBUM MÉLODIQUE AVEC DE BON SOLOS ACHETER CET ALBUM."
5,Well Researched and Exciting Antarctic Cliffhanger,"I was first attracted to this novel because I have written on lands that have once appeared on sea charts but then were lost. Thompson Island is one of these. Jenkins has managed to fuse the political crime/terrrorism aspect with this phenomenon and craft a highly taut, well developed techno-thriller. It is a bit slow to develop at first because he has his protagonist get into some academic discussion with his seagoing companion about antarctic currents and plankton fields, but the reader soon gets the gist of its import for the plot. Briefly, Thompson Island was said to have rich deposits of caesium (not really attributed, but since its a lost island, who knows?). Caesium is an extremely rare metal used in Field-emission electric propulsion, a key component for interplanetary spacecraft. His characters are deftly drawn and not mere Bondian caricatures. A good read, informative as well as entertaining."
5,A nice helper,"This was purchased for a high school sophomore to help with reading and understanding the play. It was a nice addition to his school work and class discussions. Buying the Cliffs Notes would probably be more helpful for longer and more complicated stories, but I think it is a good way to help younger readers learn how to extract pertinent information from their reading."
4,A good book to read,"I found The Crucible very amusing, i was on the edge of my seat the whole time reading it. You know what is really happening and can see how blind most of the characters are. It really shows the difference of how seriously witchcraft was taken back then and how these days it is more common and maybe a bit more acceptable. The characters are also one to do a good study on, a variety."
2,What is going on??????,"I had a vague idea of the plot of this book, but it did not expand much. It started with no introduction and ended with no resolution. I was totally confused..."
2,Very unorganized and confusing.,"I thought that The Crucible was a very confusing book. I did not understand how in one act, they can be in a house talking to someone, and in the next act, they're in court, confessing to witch craft. I would not recommend this book unless you would really be able to understand what is going on."
2,Ugh,"How can anyone find this confusing? This is a pretty simple work, and I find it difficult to believe that anyone can be confused as to what it's about. And why would you need Cliff Notes for this?In any event, my problem with this play is that its just too simple: not enough meat and the characters aren't all that interesting. Yes, it shows us how narrow-minded the Puritans were. It's also an allegory for McCarthyism, for those of you who don't know. But do we really need this play to point out what it tells us about human nature? I personally find it overly long and overly dull for what it's trying to convey."
3,"Save a Horse, Ride a Captain","The scene where Alexander gets on top of Captain Kirk and starts riding him is one of the funniest things I have ever seen. When I saw it for the first time I about died. I wonder how William Shatner was able to do that without quitting his job. As for the rest, this is an episode that shows ""Absolute power corrupts absolutely."" It also shows how some people in the world can be walked on. This episode is also ground breaking for the first interracial kiss on television."
1,The worst show ever!,"You thought ""Spock's Brain"" was bad, wait until you see this clunker. Absolutely annoying, boring, and just plain stupid. It doesn't really deserve 1 star, but it's the lowest I could give it."
3,"Textbook excellent release, perhaps too textbook.","3 1/2Another quality release as the band coasted through their medieval stride produced an excellent starting point for the curious, offering the many different undervalued styles this singer and guitarist sought out to a polished tee. In this impressive sampler overview of the dark renaissance revivalists, parts seem to outweigh the whole. Individual tracks never feel shoddy or tacked on, but as a whole, Dead Can Dance provide a few too many profound filler tracks that do little to propel the album. As usual, the mark of talent and originality highlight nearly everything, even if that distinct mark was starting to become a little transparent and predictable."
4,"Good CD, liked Enya, Enigma, and Delerium a little more.","This is a nice relaxing CD. It sort of reminded me of the Gregorian ""Chant"" CD. It is a good CD to fall asleep to as well. Dead Can Dance use the rhythm of the instruments as the base, I prefer a little more beat than this CD had to offer though. Also, ""As the Bell Rings the Maypole Spins"" (Track 6), sounded as if the flutes were being accompanyed by a cheap Casio keyboard set in a loop. (I think they were supposed to be bagpipes). The CD was a little short in length, only 36 minutes. Despite the shortcomings I've mentioned, the female vocals are crystal clear and truly spectacular while the male vocals were a little lacking. Overall, a strong addition to my collection and I enjoyed it. I think you will like it if you are looking for a something a little different. An excellent CD."
4,Nice addition to any neo-medieval fan's collection,"To be honest, I cannot say that I'm a big fan of most DCD's albums, prefering more european medieval or celtic themes (McKennitt, Fladley or Blackmore's Night are good examples of it), but this album is certainly an exception and some trackes are really great, especially 2 and 6. If you like neo-medieval music, I recommend you to buy this disk."
5,Addictive and Memorable,"I first heard this at some shop in the early 90's, saw the cover, and spent four years looking for it afterwards. When I bought it, I soon remembered why I liked it so much. This is perfect music for creating art, getting 'aquainted' with someone, whatever."
5,Haunting,"I first bought this album on cassette back in the late 80's. The purchase was based solely upon a brief commercial I'd heard on the radio for a Dead Can Dance concert in Berkeley -- I'd never actually heard DCD, or even heard of them (DCD never have received much airplay, probably because they're so difficult to categorize). The tape did not disappoint -- in fact, it was *way* beyond anything I'd expected or even hoped for. The tape is long since worn out, and I'm working on wearing out the CD (along with all their other CDs). If you're not familiar with DCD, this is the one I'd start with. I especially like the almost hypnotic ""As The Bell Rings The Maypole Spins"" -- you'll never think of bagpipes in the same way again. :-) Superb!"
5,My Favorite,"This is my favorite Dead Can Dance album and I own virtually all of them. I could put the entire cd on ""repeat"" and listen to it all night. This is an atmospherically beautiful collection that evokes soaring medieval cathedrals, courtly dances, and sacred mysteries. I feel particularly moved by Saltarello, Black Sun, and the Arrival and the Reunion. Rich and exotic, I would heartily recommend this album as one of the duo's best."
5,Fortune Presents!,"""Fortune Presents Gifts NOt AccorDing To The Book""..Ahh! This is the stuff Maynard..(Farina Chow Commercial of the 1950's..)That song taught me to hold on..""SOmetimes when you seek wisdom it's fruits,sometimes when you seek fruits it's wisdom.."" or something like that: Beautiful melodies..Reminds me of when I was in Japan and Daniel Barenboim of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra ignored me..Delightful music that's there for you when no persOn or thing is..""The Song of thE Sibyl"" is a beautiful song: The live veRsion off ""Toward The Within"" (their best cd with ""Within The Realm of a Dying Sun"" perhaps..)is going to be played at my funeral.Simply cannot state how wonderful this is..Lisa Gerrard's ""Mirror Pool""'s the next thing you can buy that's like this.."
2,"If you don't LOVE flamenco, it's not worth it","In the movie, Flamenco Women, if you don't absolutely love the art of dancing and flamenco, it is not worth it. Although it would be an excellent documentary, it does nothing for aspiring dancers, or viewers who want to learn more about flamenco."
1,British filmmaker misunderstands flamenco,"Michael Figgis doesn't have a clue about flamenco, as he proves with this idiotic documentary film. It is a murky film shot in grainy black and white, a jumble of 5-10 second snippets--mostly isolation shots of dancers' feet. This reduces flamenco to nothing more than flashy footwork. The viewer is left with no sense of the use of the arms (very important for female dancers), the choreography nor the interplay of dancers with the singer and guitarists. All we are left with is a confused jumble of very noisy and disjointed footwork. For a real look at flamenco, watch Saura's ""Flamenco."""
5,Superb Professional in Action,"For aficionados of Flamenco dance this is the ultimate film. No amateurshere, only superb masters of the art. Both in the practice shown and thefinal spectacle, we see these dancers at their best. It is a film thatwill be viewed over and over by those who are dazzled by these artists~"
5,Don't fear 1953. This is for the serious student.,"The English speaking student of Czech has one distressing problem: grammar. Czech has seven cases that may call for variations in spelling of nouns depending on usage. Adjectives change to follow gender. Conjugation of verbs is critical as the verb form variations substitute for pronouns.When it is no longer enough to be able to ask, ""How far to the Charles Bridge,"" you must tackle the grammar. There is no better textbook. Students should take classes, if possible, as well. The use of the Harkins book by foreign language departments in American universities has probably been a fortunate stroke that kept it in print. It is priced like a college textbook. You would consider it a valuable addition to your library."
4,Great Resource and study aid,"As I slowly work my way through this book I continue to be impressed. It's a bit different from the typical grammar resource and I am sure that is related to the fact that it is not so 'modern' in 2010 as it was when it was first published. That's part of the charm I think. As anyone that is attempting this challenging language has learned, resources are not abundant and good resources are even more scarce. I highly recommend purchasing and working through this book. The used price is reasonable. A key to the exercises would be helpful (it was meant as as a textbook so the reason why not is clear) but not having one just makes one more careful in getting it right the first time. Again - different but recommended."
4,"An ""ancient"" book of basic Czech grammar","I bought this second-hand book in order to learn a little bit about the Czech language, for the purpose of understanding announcements made in an online classical music radio station emanating from the Czech Republic. I have used this book very little. It was delivered promptly, was in excellent shape (pristine used condition--no writing or markings) and was very reasonably priced.I took away a rating star because of its age and stilted writing style. Yes, it _was_ Modern (note the title) at some time in its past :-). I would certainly order more books from this same supplier, without any hesitation."
5,Johnny Cash,"My wife is a Johnny Cash fan. She found "" The Very Best of the Sun Years"" very appealing, for the fans of the earlier Johnny Cash."
3,It is a good book,"It groups words into functional groups - medicine, car parts, countries, etc. This might be a good reference. I don't quite learn this way though."
5,A great ska-rock hybrid,"If you're looking for a modern ska-rock hybrid, this is it. I found this to be a very energetic album with a biting and humorous lyrical style."
3,"Sometimes ""change"" is not good!","White's third release (1982) on his own Unlimited Gold label is more an extension of the second, ""Sheet Music."" The title cut touts a ""change"" in the Maestro's musical direction but such a path doesn't fit the trademark White sound. Restraining the use of strings and full orchestra, White goes for a funkier sound that, for this listener, just doesn't work. It wouldn't be until his end-of-the-decade releases on A & M that he would return to form that made him such a success in the seventies.But, an ""average"" White release still beats anything on the pop/R & B charts today."
2,"I'd like my money back, thanks.","This book wasn't interesting enough to keep me reading after the first (and I just checked where I left the bookmark) 23 pages, and, in fact, the writing style itself was stilted and uncomfortable. Ick. Sorry, Matthew Hughes, but this stuff isn't for me."
2,Well...,"This CD would be the greatest 60's folk compilation ever if only the songs weren't all simply covers by a group of people I've never heard of in my life. They fail to mention this anywhere in the description, and they even go so far as listing the original artists on the track listing above (which is misleading). BUT...if you listen to the samples, you can tell that these people are not the original artists you know and love. But I give it two stars because it is a great song selection...and good for singing along with."
2,"Ok, But nothing insightful","The basic idea in this book is your are going to lose money at a casino the trick is to get enough ""comps"" to make up for your losses. Mrs. Scott describes how slots are a big part of the casinos take and how they should only be played ""for fun"". She then devotes 1/4 of the book to video poker and how it can, over the long term, one can break even with playing accepted strategy. The last part of the book is what I found most disappointing. Mrs. Scott states there are 3 ways to get comps, Earn them on your Players Card, Get them in the mail, or ask a slot host. There is no real insight into the comp world.My other complaint is on just about every other page she pushes all her other products from Huntington Press, and her video poker computer simulation program.To sum up this book play video poker, you will lose the least amount of money, clip coupons, look for free promotions and ask a slot host for free things."
5,Rashi's Daughter,"I loved this book. Even though it is a work of fiction, it taught me a lot about the life and times of this great family. I was sorry to get to the last page. I look forward to reading the next book in the trilogy."
2,Not as Good as I Expected,"After reading such great reviews, I had high hopes for this book. However, it did not live up to my expectations. In the description on the back, it talks about how Joheved must basically choose between her love of the Talmud and martial happiness. That didn't play out at all in the book. In fact, it was pretty minor. She really didn't keep her studies all that hidden. I was kind of annoyed by the style of writing. It seemed to jump from character to character or event to event without me even realizing where we were going. There was a lot of sex that almost bordered on the ridiculous side. For a fan of historical fiction, this was not for me. I don't think I'll read the other two."
2,Disappointing,"I was overly excited to read this novel based upon all of the glowing reviews, and because as a jewish woman, I thought I would feel a historical and religious connection with the characters. Unfortunately, I found the book boring and slow. I thought the dialogue was weak and the storyline dragged on interminably. I really wanted to love this book, but just couldn't connect with it."
1,heavy on the sex -- light on the interesting,With historical fiction being one of my favorites I was intrigued at the title and book description of Rashi's Daughters. The book hooked me from the start--but steadily and rapidly declined from there. By the end I was only skimming and no longer interested in the strong libidos of the main characters. I am also unconvinced that the dynamics and relationships were representative of the time period.
4,Learned a great deal!,"I loved the book because I learned so much about the Jewish faith and the life of people, in particular women, of that period. The inclusion of the words from Rashi, the Talmud, and the Tractates made it seem even more real and informed me. I recommend this book and the other 2 in the series very highly."
2,Disappointing,"I am a fan of historic fiction and recently purchased both Books I and II to take on a vacation. While the first 100 pages of Book I held my interest, it deteriorated into little more than a trashy romance novel with little historical value. Book II, however, was AWFUL. Anton makes baseless accusations about loveless marriages and sexual proclivities of real people, without regard for the truth. She admits, in a note at the end, that there is NO BASIS for her allegations. This goes way beyond mere ""artistic license"". It is irresponsible and thoughtless for Anton to treat her subjects this way. I urge the publisher to be more careful with regard to subsequent books by this author."
3,Rashi's eldest daughter; the Noblewoman.,"While interesting and chock full of historic detail, I was disappointed with the whole series. Rashi's daughters are bourgeois Jewish ladies in 11th Century France. I was hoping to read about the experience of the whole community in this era, but bourgeois is all I got. I also got the distinct impression that I was not the intended audience for this series, and that's an unpleasant feeling. Get it from the library, don't buy it."
2,Its OK,"This is an OK album, but nothing special really. Pretty but generic. At first it wasn't bad, but about half way through the album, I found my mind wandering a bit. It is fine to read to, but for serious listening, it just didn't work for me."
4,Very good movie!!,Thank you for the movie. Kiefer Sutherland is a great actor and always enjoy to watch his work. The movie 1969 is a good movie to watch.
2,waste of money...,"This Vietnam-era coming-of-age story his hopelessly dull, boring, and predictable. Of course the brother's going to get killed and Sutherland's character is going to hook up with best friend's little sister. Were we really supposed to believe that they'd go to Canada, and what's with the hoaky ending?!?!? Watched this on VHS -- I couldn't imagine why anybody would pay $40 for the DVD -- full-screen and no features..."
2,Disappointed,"It worked great for the first 2weeks I had it, but it is already torn in a worn away type fashion. Not well designed or 'manufactured'. I am VERY Disappointed."
1,Web Description is not complete!,"This product includes Rose Hips but, the web description does not include this fact. The web Description must be changed. I suggest that the web page show the Supplement Facts portion of the label clearly so that it can be easily read."
5,Amazing blend of food for cichlids,My fish LOVE this food. They are so much more active and approach the glass throughout the day in hopes of feeding time. This was not the case prior to use of this food. Even my cats go crazy over the smell of this stuff. It really does smell like fish. (In a good way.)
3,It's ok,"I bought this food for my 4 inch Oscar. He doesn't eat it because the pieces are TINY, and they sink really fast. I recently added a convict to my tank, and luckily he eats them. He is fast enough and will eat from the bottom. Do not get this if you have a larger breed of fish."
5,Still making classic rock,"After reading the other reviews, I was concerned that Starcastle was becoming too ""Yes"" influenced. That was dispelled from the very first few seconds of the disc, it was obvious Starcastle was back and that classic rock was still being made. A very listenable collection."
2,Sadly dissapointed,"Like many other reviewers, I was disappointed on first listen. I have been a long-time Starcastle fan, and so bought the CD in spite of the reviews. I have always been able to get around the Yes comparison (Yes being one of my favorite bands) but would have to agree that this seemed like a rather badly done, direct Yes knockoff attempt.I'll listen to it a few more times before passing ultimate judgment, but only because of my past devotion to the band. Sadly, this album does not sound anything like the Starcastle of old, and only one song- All For The Thunder, caught my interest.I wish it wasn't so, and I feel bad giving a band I like a negative review, but there you go. If they put out another one I'm sure I'll buy it too and hope for the best."
3,Three stars (with the possibility for 1/2 a star more),"Starcastle were a bunch of 2nd-rate, Yes imitating hacks thirty years ago. They were a prog-mimic band who weren't all that good in their prime. And they were over the hill by '81. This album is from 2007. So how come it is so good?Maybe they don't have the forced attention span of the REAL Yes, perhaps they have ADD, because their songs rarely crack the 7 minute mark. This is more prog-pop but for that genre it is mighty fine. Anyway, you'd never guess this was 2007, sounds so 70's.If the name ""Starcastle"" suggests airy-fairy pink ethereal smoke rings, then yeh. But the songwriting is strong; the first six songs are all excellent, the remaining three vary...But do the vocals have to be so soft and limp? Sometimes they are rushed and buried in the mix. That semi-ruins great tracks like ""Red Seaon"" and ""Love is the only place in time"". So a 4-star rating drops to a 3-star rating."
2,Just another path leading nowhere,"Amongst the lowest leveled in an endless parade of third-rate Yes imitators, SC play only a few high cards amidst a terrible hand of sharp cheddar cheese."
4,"Fun, but excessive","Any book recommended by Jimmy Buffett shouldn't be bad, should it? The follies of Norman Paperman, a New York PR guy running a hotel and bar in the Carribean, captures the dangers of chasing an obsessive dream. The writing is solid, if stretched, but you find youself hoping everything works out for the best.The book is at it's strongest when Wouk describes interpersonal relations. He colorfully describes New York society at it's finest (at worst) as well as the society life down on the islands. Capturing the protagonist at his failings makes for a deeper novel.The downside of the book is the extended existance of Murphy's Law. After the first hundred pages or so, each mistake or folly becomes predictable. In that sense, I really wish the book had been shorter."
2,Don't Stop The Carnival,"Started out OK but the ending was too abrupt, and predictable. We spend alot of time in the Bahamas and many of the situations Wauk created rang true!"
3,Good but not great,"Unlike many, I found this book not quite living up to expectations. It's ongoing comments about coloreds and whites mingling date the material (ok, it was written a while back) and the ending is a bit strange based on the character development and what you assume their interpersonal relationships. It left me not feeling satisfied when I turned the last page. Additionally, I found much of the book predictable. Something bad happens, it gets fixed - Something bad happens, it gets fixed. Over and over until you feel like you could skip a few chapters and not be any worse off. Rather than building on each mishap, they simply repeat. Additionally, the ending simply drops characters. Whatever happened to the pregnant housemaid? Why simply... well I don't want to ruin it for you if you haven't read it. Let's just say the book finds a simple (though trite) solution for getting characters out of the book. And that left me disappointed."
2,Not worth the price of admission.,"Being a Parrothead, I dearly wanted to enjoy this book, I tried to enjoy this book, but I found Wouk's writing style to be dull and lifeless. The story concept was good, but was quickly slaughtered by Wouk's amateurish ramblings. Norman Paperman came off as a shallow, light-handed yuppie, better suited for a Harlequin novella."
5,Required reading for anyone thinking about investing in the tropics.,"Highly entertaining and very true!! I owned and ran a hotel in the tropics for 15 years. Don't Stop the Carnival is reality based! We think we have found paradise, and then... The local's attitude that all Americans are to be fleeced hasn't changed. Being in this atmosphere is an amazing adventure that takes all you have to give. Don't invest more in the tropics than you are willing to lose. The book is an excellent statement of how it still is."
4,You had to be there.,"On target at capturing the nuances of life in the islands. What some may not know is that Wouk wrote the novel while he was living in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands. It was not well received there by locals as his characters may have resembled some. Later he moved. It is a cult classic there among many who live or lived (self) there for awhile."
5,"A comedy of errors in Carribean time, mon!","After traveling the Carribean, yourealize those folks march to a differentbeat. Time is not very important in theland of sun and azure seas unless youare a transported New Yorker trying tobuy and run a broken down hotel on asmall tourist resort island. A mustread if you have ever dreamed ofshucking it all and moving to the islandsto live ""happily ever after!"""
3,"Sadly, a disappointment.","As a Parrothead (Jimmy Buffett fan) I was anxious to read one of JB's favorite books which is the basis for his ""Don't Stop the Carnival"" musical (with Wouk writing the stageplay). Unfortunately the story is predictable and shallow. The novel reads more like a long short story with a lack of depth and a difficulty in identifying with the characters. I loved some of Wouk's later novels so much I was let down. I did enjoy the island descriptions which transported me to this imaginary island. Wouk's skills are visable but the story is weak. Could he have written this when he was in grade school?"
4,Worth a read,"Required reading if you intend to start up a business (especially a resort) in the Caribbean, eh Chaz?"
3,Don't Stop The Carnival,At times I grew tired of reading about disaster after disaster from an impulsive character. In this day and age it's offensive reading the words negro and homo.
5,Great Addition,"This is a great addition to for your word reference library. If you ever feel that there may be a better word to describe what your trying to say, then this just may be the book that will help you find that word."
3,Excellent reference but dated electronic search capability,I have the 1992 edition of Word Menu. The book itself is an excellent reference and I use it frequently. However it comes with three floppy disks for electronic searching using the outdated DOS operating system. It needs a more up-to-date electronic search capability using a CD-ROM and a Windows based search engine. I have been mulling over how I could convert the DOS search capability to Windows.
4,Old Ben was a very good book about a boy and his pet snake.,"Old Ben was about how a boy teaches his parents that a black snake could be useful. I read the book and liked it a lot. I would like to read it over again. It made me want to get my own snake! The author said that this story was based on a real snake. Audrey Smith, age 8."
1,Horrible,"This book is by far the worst Vietnam War novel I have ever read. It is historically inaccurate. It portrays the Vietnamese as being compliant with the Geneva Convention, but as American prisoners were considered criminals rather than POWs, the Vietnamese did not follow the Geneva Convention. Nothing really happens in this book. It's more of an odd philosophy that has nothing to do with the war. There is little to no action in the book. Nothing really happens."
5,Best I have,"I have been listening to music for over 40 years and plyed music myself years ago.This Tom Schuman cd is the best that I have in my collection,from almost a thousand cd's that I posses.I am so happy Amazon let me listen before I bought.I never new about the guy.What a great experience."
3,One more reference!,It is another method that they say help autistic boys. I didn't finish reading it but I think always is good to have more information sources.
4,THE FRIST AUTISIM BOOK I READ,I am very very intrested in autisum. i hope to teach autistic kids somday anyhow this was the frist book on it I read. it is one of the best if you want o start your bacsi understanding of autism
3,Beneficial,Maybe a little dated but helpful in explaining facts of life. Any helps I can get in this area is appreciated!
4,This is a Good One !,"I love finding new stuff ! Mamas Boys Power & Passion is a hell of a cd. There is just something about a trio rock band where they are pretty much forced to rock straight forward with power cords and driving rythmns with the guitarist throwing out some mean solo leads and you've got a winning combination.Dont let their name throw ya, Mommas Boys were hell raisers with their rock n roll. This is a band and this particuliar cd that any fan of rock should check out. Head bangin, fist pumping music, with sing along lyrics that make it all infectous. This cd will absolutely spend some time in your player I guarantee it !"
4,Clever,"Ms. Harmon obviously has a lot of experience with birders. Her descriptions of the various roles that over serious birders take on are almost painfully spot on, but amusing. It's especially nice to read after an Audubon meeting. There's also the uncomfortable recognition of my own patterns. Too true."
5,"DANCING WITH ""ENGE""....","WELL - WHO WOULD HAVE BELIEVED THE ""KING OF ROMANCE"" WOULD RECORD SUCH AN ALBUM? GUESS WHO... IT IS SO UP-BEAT AND UP-TO-DATE..THIS MAN KNOWS HOW TO SING ANY KIND OF SONG. A GREAT CURRENT STYLE FOR ENGE AND HE IS TERRIFICO....ONE OF THE BEST TALENTS TODAY..GET THIS NEW ALBUM - YOU WILL LOVE IT...."
5,"A toe-tapping CD, especially the Spanish ""Cuando...""","My husband and I just love this CD and play it constantly in the car. It is a fun album, and Engelbert's fun in making it is obvious. We love the entire thing. The new songs have to be heard a few times but the updated renditions are superb."
4,So cute in a little girl's room!,"I got this for Christmas one year when I was younger, and my friend and I had a blast decorating all the flowers with paint and hanging the canopy up. We put the individual flowers on the wall in a pattern like this: _-_- so it looked like the flowers were growing together but weren't perfectly even- it looked so cute like that. In fact, once we were done with everything and put it up, it gave my room a theme and was adorable! After years of use, the flowers' fabric started stretching and getting holes in them, but for the price they are worth the money. I would definitely recommend this for a little princess' room."
5,Great Collection of Wonderful Performers,"If you try them, you'll be hooked! The Harmonists were the toast of Germany and the world until they ran afoul of the Nazi's since they had a couple of jewish members."
1,Made My Hair Hard..I will never buy it again,"I tried this product with my Conair hot rollers and, it does not set my hair properly. It did not dry all the way and, my curls were hard with no body.When I set my hair I use Herbal Essense holding moose and, it makes my hair bouncy with curls that hold for two days. So, I will stick with Herbal Essense.Buy this product Lottabody at your own risk."
5,The Best Avail Record To Date!!!!,"What can I say? This album is perfect! If you can buy only one Avail CD, buy this one and protect it with your life. You will not be dissapointed."
3,It's what you expect from avail...,"...and that's become disappointing. It took awhile but I've gotten to the point where I see a formula to the bands music. I can time the solo, I know where he's going to break it down, I know how the chrous is going to go. Bad, bad, bad thing. If you like Avail this is exactly what you've come to expect. It seems that they've stopped growing. Which is the first sign of a band in decline. Hopefully they'll come out with something shakes things up again."
4,"very good, but not equal to other avail releases!","Avail is one of my favorate bands, but this record does not compair to ""4am friday"" or ""dixie."" i hope that the next release has harder songs than this."
3,Avail aschmail,Give me something that I'll actually tap my foot to when I drive-- something that I'll hit my fist against the dashboard with every five seconds... something this album isn't.
5,one of the best!!!,"in 1991 heavy metal was about to die a fast and painful death. that couldn't be blamed on bands like armored saint....they were doing what they did from day one, playing loud, in your face, aggresive, heavy rock. this album is probably the best example of what a great band they were, (are), every song on this album is a masterpiece! i can't even think of a stand out track because every song gets my blood boiling, from start to finish, this is almost a perfect heavy metal album. i bought symbol of salvation when it first came out and i still listen to it like it's a new album. if you love timeless heavy metal then you'll love ""symbol of salvation""! buy it NOW!"
4,A little boring.,"I love the Chicken Soup books, but I wasn't too much into this one. One of the sections was all about women writing about how they were proposed to. And they weren't out of the ordinary proposals either. If you like sappy, romantic stuff, then this book is for you. I like these books because a lot of the stories are either totally amazing, or they teach you a lesson. This one didn't really teach me any lessons and I didn't learn anything.But then again...I'm not married,so maybe I just couldn't relate. If you're not into romance, then obviously, skip this one. I still have to give it 4 stars because it's not a bad book, it's just not to my personal taste."
4,Truly Chicken Soup for the Bride's Soul,"I read this book when I was planning my wedding and it really was a cup of chicken soup for the bride's soul. It reminded me of the things that were important, it gave me ideas and made me grateful for the things I did NOT have to deal with. I have made it a practice to purchase this book for my friends as they get engaged and start planning their weddings. Although, I must admit, I enjoy all Chicken Soup books."
3,top corner bent,The book was in good condition except the top corner of the book was bent. When its a new book and the edges are bent it looks used.
4,Thoughtful account of 5 series history,"A well researched and written book on the history of the e12, e28, e34 & e39 5 series generations. Some interesting new facts revealed by this title. The good coverage of US spec 5 series models made a refreshing change from the usual UK publications. Pricey, but worth a look."
3,"Good Book For Overall History, So So Pictures","...good book for overall history on the 5-series...so so pictures......if you like bmw 'm' cars, bmw itself published a lavish 30-year anniversary book detailing all aspects of its 'm' cars......cranswick's book, combined with bmw's 'm' book, should complete an enthusiast's library, imho..."
2,Enthusiasts only,"Whilst this book is a must have for any BMW fünf-er enthusiast, I cannot recommended it for anyone else. The author seems very knowledgeable about the mechanics of these cars, but he drones on endlessly about pollution control and the oil crisis. Granted, important topics to understand the history of these cars, but it would have been a better use of print to cover the high performace versions instead.Also as others mention, the photography is aweful. Not only are the often grainy and out of focus but the subject car is often dirty, under poor lighting, or are heavily customized (the author says 'tastefully', I disagree.) Not the type of thing you should see in a fine book. Also, do we need really need to see a full color spread of the Pontiac Firebird (pg 29) or the AMC Pacer (pg 20)?I summary, knowledgeable author, decent writing, but horrible packaging."
5,lovely drawings and poems,"very useful for people suffering from loss, beautifully presented. too bad this book is out of print as I would order several other copies for friends and family."
5,Love it!!,Exactly what we were looking for for our metal detecting!!!Perfect for digging right size holes for the right depth!!Excellent purchase!!!
5,"Save your hands and back, get a Lesche!","This tool should be included with all metal detectors. When I first started out, I figured I had plenty of tools around the house that would work just fine for digging a penny up 3-8 inches deep right? Wrong :(. The garden trowel was too weak, and I ended up pulling a back muscle trying to use a miniature pick-axe in hard packed gravel. With the lesche, the tip is narrow and strong enough to dig between and pry up gravel and other hard materials, and makes digging a proper plug in soft grass a breeze. Combined with the Pro-Pointer, you can estimate the depth and with a little practice pop the coins to the surface without even digging a hole!"
4,Excellent digger,Excellent metal detecting tool. Very robust. Excellent carrier. I did sharpen it to improve its root cutting ability but otherwise I am very happy with it. Handle on product received was black.
2,Disappointing,"As much as I loved the first novel in this series ""The Fabulous Life of Emily Briggs"" was as disappointed as I was with this book ""Escape from Bridzella."" The author tries too hard to make the book as fun as the first, but fails to give the characters any emotions or depth. I found myself skipping passages just to get to the end. I was incredibly let down as I ordered ""Bridzella"" while I was enthralled in reading ""Emily Briggs."""
4,emily again,I loved the first Emily Briggs book and couldn't wait for the follow up. I was disappointed with some of the events of this book but overall enjoyed the book. I did get tired of Emily's comment - I'm not materialistic - over and over in the book.
1,0 Stars,This book was terrible. Tried to read it on a plane trip and couldn't finish. Not sure how so many people could like it. Had terrible grammar and horrible story that went nowhere. Don't waste your money or time.
1,"Shallow and Obnoxious,","I can't believe someone agreed to publish this junk! The ""heroine"" is so disgusting. It took me forever to read because I had to keep looking up and rolling my eyes. We get it - you're better than everyone else. But not nearly as clever as you think you are."
1,Bad writing,I could not get into this book AT ALL. I can't relate to the character and I swear if the author uses one more high school english sentence I'm going to scream. I'm not going to waste my time with this one.
2,Nothing special,"I had a hard time getting into this book as well and it never seemed to get exciting. Pretty level throughout and that does not make for a great book. Also, very predictable. I would not recommend it."
1,Unhappy I wasted the money,"I am very unhappy that I spent the money on this book. Poorly written and boring are what I would use to describe this novel. I do not know where the editor was at with this one. And why was this book entitled the way it was? There was nothing about a bride, only a girl shopping and being carelessly rude to everyone that she came in contact with. I can go on for hours about the grammar and word usage in this book, but I will not waste my time. It is enough to say I was very unhappy."
1,don't waste your money,I could not get past page 20 in this book and even that was a tremendous effort. Don't waste your time unless you like a spoiled selfish character and a boring plot.Wasn't worth the money it was printed on.
1,Beyond bad!!,"This was a book for the month in my book club. Of 10 readers, not one of us could finish this book. Not one. The most common complaints were:1. Bad grammar2. Confusing plot that did not move3. Main character was very shallow and not fun to read about4. Writing was very, very badI agree with the other members' thoughts. This book was a waste of our time and money. Will think twice before believing reviews on here again. I do not know how this got published and whoever wrote the back cover copy did not read the book, because that is not what the book is about. Don't be fooled."
5,Everybody knows that's the 'Way To Go'!,"OMG!!!! This is like the hottest song ever! Following up to the multi-platinum success of their single, 'Voodoo Child', the Rogue Traders release this thumper of a song!!!!!Rogues and Natalie 4 Ever!"
1,Totally boring bad Song!,"I can't see what the hype with this OZ overhyped electro-pop-rock Band Rogue Traders is, nor this single WAY TO GO, which I found utterly boring and not dance enticing at all! After 1-2 Listens to this, I had enough and was fed up with this song, as well as the Ex neighbours Singer Natalie whose voice I dont find good at all! So 1 Star (though I would like to give it zero stars) for this...It would take an enourmous improvement in songwriting and music, better with no rock and introduce some trance style...But I realy doubt that is going to happen - Rather Stick to LASGO, Sylver, Kate Ryan etc, and forget about the Rogue Traders, they are so overhyped in Australia (incl. this single), its just unbelievable!"
5,Rarest book in Gurdjieffian canon,"Only 100 copies of this book were produced, so if you see an original copy, pick it up! The author forbids publication in the preface, so there will never be another printed edition. The book is, however, widely available on the various file sharing sites.The author was a student of A.R. Orage during the period in which he lead the Gurdjieff Work in America (1924-1931), and he attempts to set down a complete exposition of the basic ideas he learned from Orage. The material can be nicely contrasted with three other books: 1)""In Search of The Miraculous"" which presents the ""Ouspenskyian version"" of Gurdjieff's ideas 2) ""Psychological Commentaries on the Teachings of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky"" which presents Dr. Maurice Nicoll's take on The Work, and last but not least 3) ""Beelzebub's Tales To His Grandson,"" which comes to straight from the horse's mouth, with no chaser!"
2,there are many better books...,"I was very disapointed from this book. Too much time is wasted in useless exercises, and not enough inspiration is given. I was lucky enough to order a few writing aids books from Amazon so I could easily compare. This is the worse by far. Dont waste your time, look elsewhere unless you have too much free time and want to waste it in useless exercises which could be effective if given in a classroom, not on your own."
4,Book was a hit,"I got this book for my mother who is an aspiring writer. She read it all in one day, then read it again and took so many notes from it. She is very excited to write her book and is thankful for ""So You Want to Write a Novel"" as an aid."
2,"Well, well, well...","It has taken me a long time, but I have finally found what I consider to be a mediocre piece of writing by Nabokov. Apparently he partially wrote it languidly sprawled on a beach sometime during an idle period in his late twenties, and it shows. It is a bright piece of fiction, but lazily put together. The characters do not sparkle, the love traingle plot is tiresome, and even the style seems somewhat deadened - there are some highlights, such as country boy Franz blundering myopically through Berlin without his glasses - but too much of this novel attempts whimsical virtuousity but ends up coming across as sterile. Witness the terrible innuendos to describe orgasms - you can spot them..."
3,Delicious detail that left me limp,"Wonderful writing, meandering plot, and characters who were hollow at the core. In fact, they were almost caricatures: the cold, scheming wife, the callow, easily-manipulated youth, and the jolly, blustering, unseeing husband. I won't give away the ending, but my basic reaction was ""so what?"" I struggled to finish this, since I had absolutely no interest in what happened to any of them.However, the journey is the destination, so to speak, and perhaps I should have paid more heed to the first chapter; it takes place on a train--a message to the reader? The sights, smells, and sensations of this novel were entrancing. In the end, however, I was no more moved than if I had observed the action of this novel through a train window."
4,TNA Slammiversary 2009,The Best match on the card was the X Division King Of The Mountain because it delivered supreme athleticism and creativity.The TNA Tag Team Championship was just as good.The Mixed Monster's Ball Tag Team was pretty good for a weapons match.The King Of The Mountain match for the TNA World's title was not great but pretty good mainly beacuase of the swerve ending of the bout.The rest are ok.I give this event a 8 out of 10.
3,It was ok...,"I thought it was OK... but the boys never asked to watch it again, meaning they were not impressed. When they like a show, they won't leave it alone."
1,Sad representation of a wonderful saint,"I was very sad and angry to see how the VT crew butchered the life of a powerful saint. Saint Nicholas was a good and holy man, not a misguided preacher's kid. I can even get over the silliness about him being a masked hero running through the streets, but I cannot stand the slander of his early life. If you aren't going to speak the truth about holy men, avoid their stories completely. BTW he was not Greek, he was from Turkey. Getting kinda sick of the Orthodox=ethnic associations that seem to be acceptable. There was plenty to produce a powerful story of learning and loving God as you grow up into the faith, not turning it into the false ""He got saved"" moment that is the typical adult Evangelical conversion story."
5,Very Fub Christmas movie,Very fun christmas movie. All kinds of teaching moments in this video. My favorite line in the movie is we don't give because it makes us feel happy. We give because we are happy.:)
5,Excellent!,"I watched this Christmas Veggie tales with my 11, 8, and 4 year old children and found it to be appropriate content for their age. It was very funny, captivating, and inspirational regarding giving the Love of Christ to others."
3,"St. Nicholas is OK, but not great","We were a bit disappointed in this Veggitales Christmas offering. Some of the characters were not readily-identifiable as fruit or veggies and the story dragged. The music was also disappointing - not very memorable.Stick with the older ""Toy That Saved Christmas"" or ""Star of Christmas"" offerings from Veggietales - they were much better products."
5,As Expected,We pretty much have all Veggie Tale dvds made and this is so far the favorite of my 2 year old. Now we can give Lessons from the Sock Drawer a rest. We got this the day it came out and she wants to watch it several times a day. As I am writing this she has given it a break today and is watching Silly Songs but really if we need to get work done we pop in Veggie Tales. My oldest is 17 and he will still watch em with his younger sisters! They have been a part of our family for years and I still get excited to see new ones come out and have yet to be disappointed!!
5,Great alternative to all the Santa movies,We enjoyed this movie as an alternative to all the santa movies out there. My kid found it relatable and fun!
1,Garbage,"I love the Veggie Tales series, but this is garbage. The ""true"" true story of St. Nicholas apparently has nothing to do with him being a bishop and fighting heresy, but is simply a retelling of http://www.amazon.com/Santa-Claus-Comin-Town-Astaire/dp/B000A345EE/ complete with reindeer, sleigh and red suit."
5,One of the best VeggieTales videos I've seen,My wife just bought this dvd for our kids and for me (I have always loved VeggieTales). I was very excited to watch this because the other 2 VeggieTales Christmas dvd's are excellent and I was not disappointed. This show takes you through so many different emotions in about 45 minutes. It was sad when Nicholas' parents die but that is part of the true story and should not be left out. They did a wonderful job dealing with that. There are also some hilarious moments (especially Mr. Lunt). This dvd is great for the kids and parents alike!!!
2,It' s cute but not real,"If you are interested in just teach your kids about the real meaning of Christmas it is a fine but, be aware that it is not the real history of St. Nicholas. Actually I'm wondering if as Christian we should make up about others lives...We will still watching the movie ""Nicholas - The boy who became Santa Claus"" it is not silly but it is fun and teach us about the real St Nicholas!"
4,But is it real?,"My favorite thing about The Money Mystery was that it gives a bird's eye view of the history of our economy, and money in general. A very broad picture is painted and includes international context. If you are like me, someone who considers themselves to be normal but above average in terms of being informed, and curious about how the world works, you'll read this book and start to wonder, ""is this for real? Why isn't Richard Maybury more well known?"" His straight forward analysis compared to what actually goes on creates a rather surreal picture. Not to mention that if one does an internet search they will find that the Uncle Eric books enjoy something of a celebrity status among homeschooling (not bashing homeschooling, but support from homeschooling isn't always the pinnacle of credibility).Reading The Money Mystery will explain some aspects of American history from an economic standpoint, and make you wonder if things are really as crazy as Uncle Eric says."
1,Fake copy,When I wrote my first review it was on the shipping. When I gave it to my grandson we found out it wasn't a legal dvd and it was made of something that wouldn't even play. My grandson was so disappointed. I purchase two other dvds' fom different sellers and they were fine. I should have realized from the cover it was real. Really unhappy.
5,"Peter Pan, a classic for all time",My kids are young and love any type of Disney movie. I remember watching this movie on our VHS over and over again and my wife and I jumped at the chance to see it in theaters when Disney played it at the local Cinemark. Our kids loved it so much I surprised them with this after we saw it.It looks great in Blu-ray and the behind the scenes provide hours of learning and fun on the making of this classic movie.
3,Peter Pan CD,"This item was a little disappointing since he had some ""glitches"" while watching it. It was a gift to my grandson in Ca., so I took my son's word for this."
5,WOW!!!,All I can say is WOW!!! I ordered this movie 2 days ago and its here! The movie is exactly what I expected! Thank you!
2,Tough to justify in 2000,"My daughter really likes this movie but we had to have many reminders that women ARENT ""easy to trick when they are jealous"" and that Native Americans do not act like they do in the movie. I don't like censorship of any kind but in this day and age I cant just let this movie be seen without a discussion of ""fantasy vs. reality"".If you want to have this in your collection, by all means do so, it IS a classic story, and in defense of Disney, Barrie was a notorious mysogenist, However, a discussion of stereotypes would be a nice way to offset this sometimes mean-spirited movie."
2,"Racist scenes and no ""making of ""short","When I bought the Peter Pan Special Edition I had forgotten the racist portrayal of the Indians in the movie. They do live in Neverland but will kids make the distinction that if they live in Neverland it is make believe? Will they understand that not all Indians say Ugg and How like the ones in this movie? I didn't remember the ""what Makes the Red Man Red"" number from when I was kid but that was before video. Now kids can watch it over and over again.Also, my copy does not have the ""making of"" short even though it says it does on the case. This was very disappointing because I was hoping it would address the racism issue."
4,Not what I remembered,"I rented this to see if I wanted to buy it for my 2 year old and I've decided not to. It was actually pretty good, the animation is magical and the story is of course delightful. But for a 2 year old, I didn't like how Captain Hook shoots and kills one of the pirates, (it happens off-screen, but there are a lot of guns in general). And I was unhappy with how the indians are depicted, (this being 1953) especially in the song ""What made the red man red?"" Lots of ""How"" and ""Ugh"". That's one song I don't want him to learn."
4,"The kids love it, but I find it jarring. . .","*Spoiler Alert*The songs and magic and pirates and crocodiles are as vivid and lush as you remembered. . . But Tinkerbell is a sociopathic ex-girlfriend, the ""red man"" scenes are gut-cringingly racist and dated, and did I mention Tink is f*&^(&% crazy?!?The kids don't seem to see those parts so much - but it's weird to watch as an adult. . . Enjoy!"
2,Watch Out for this one.,"I love Peter and pirates and Mermaids--but this was made in 1951--so Watch Out. I didn't like my 3 yr old hearing things like ""girls talk too much"" and indians called ""redskins"" and the WORST was Tinkerbell wondering if her [...] was too fat!! If you are careful about what your littles ones watch, skip this one for now."
3,DVD is dissappointing,"Disney is definitely letting down the DVD communtiy compared to other companies. Aside from some artwork, this DVD has nothing else on it except the movie itself. Good heavens for the price Disney charges, there should be a painted cell from the movie coming with the DVD.The story itself is a classic. The animation has not held up all that well, though I think some of that has to be due to the introduction of computer animation.None of the songs are really noteworthy."
3,NOT WIDESCREEN,"Like all Disney's Classics -and I mean the real classics, not those new movies they call classics- Peter Pan has a lot of what has been called the magic of Disney. Of course there are some themes that are very questionable and politically incorrect in these days, like the way indians are depicted and Peter's Pan cruel joke of cutting Hook's hand and feeding it to a crocodile. In spite of these, ""Peter Pan"" is an excellent adventure movie for children and also, even as a child, I could appreciate the sexual appeal of the sirens and, of course, of Tinkerbell. It's nice they're finally making a movie about Tinkerbell, I just hope they do it right.The big disappointment to me was that this was not a widescreen version of the movie, that was a big let-down. They're announcing the coming realese of ""The Jungle Book"", so I hope they make it widescreen."
4,Fun movie for kids that don't get scared,"Peter Pan is an old classic and I knew my daugher,4years old, would love it. Ever since we read the book, she was talking about her ""hero"". The animation is typical Disney- good, now once again powerful and colorful.There are a couple of scarry parts with Captain Hook, cannon balls and crocodiles which didn't upset my daughter, but some children might get frightened by them. Of course one shouldn't get too deep into psychological aspects of the story (Peter Pan the boy that didn't want to grow up) or analyze sexual stereotypes (Wendy is automatically the ""mommy"" that will read stories, but never defends herself or others against Hook and his crew). It is an old Disney production, and it should be viewed and enjoyed as such."
5,Peter Pan the original,"The movie is better than the book, thank you Disney. Timeless classic that it is, you don't have to be a child to love it. This is Disney at Disneys best: pirates cove, hangmans tree, indian encampment, mermaid lagoon, and skull rock. I could live at mermaid lagoon."
4,Great! But something's wrong...,"I love Peter Pan, and I was introduced to the story through this movie. I was glad to get this DVD, and the restoration is excellent. The Special Features are grand... except one. Disney, can YOU PLEASE QUIT RE-ARRANGING GOOD OLD SONGS FOR YOUR NEW ARTISTS? Seriously, ""Second Star To The Right"" is a magical song, but the new video by T-Squad is anything but. (By the way, same thing with the Ashley Tisdale performance of ""Kiss The Girl"" on the new DVD of THE LITTLE MERMAID.) Because of this, I dropped a star out of 5.The picture is pristine and clear all throughout. The colors are just perfect. The sound is crisp and clear. Disney, you did a wonderful job restoring this picture.If you love this movie, buy this DVD.Oh, and there's a trailer for a supposed re-release of ""Return to Neverland"" on DVD. When's that going to happen, though?"
3,excitement~,"my brother liked this film about these kids that tell stories about peter pan and then he finally comes and takes them to his world where he wants them to stay, and if they dont they can never come back. The land is for kids only and they wil never grow up there. There are mermaids, and pirates, etc and new charecters and kids and exciteing for the whole family.~"
5,A classic still the best.,Replacing classic Disney movies with DVD's puts Peter Pan near the top. Can't be beat in more modern versions. Arrived promptly and in excellent condition.
2,"Sorry, Peter; I Grew Up.","Sorry, Peter, but I grew up.Actually, it's more than that. Wendy is not exactly a feminist, after all, and the Indians are not in any sense Native Americans. The jokes about them are not the sort that would be acceptable today. And it's too late for the dream of a boy who never grows up. We've heard about ""The Peter Pan Syndrome,"" and I even married one. That was Husband Number Three, actually.There's also the fact that it's very much a boys' story, and for more reasons than the unrealistic depictions of females: Wendy, Tinkerbell and Tiger Lily. Even as a child, I didn't see the point to the fake combat against the Indians and the pirates. And I considered Peter impossibly arrogant; I still do.I would not recommend this to your children and grandchildren, unless you are prepared to do a good bit of explaining the differences between 1953 and 2012."
1,Peter pan DVD set,The disc was made for eurpeon DVD players and it won't play in the us made DVD players. So it really sucked when my kids saw the disc and it won't play. My husband use to work in the DVD/cd production industry so he noticed right away the writing on the cover was in German that it won't play.
1,amazon selling incomplete dvds!!!,BEWARE! Your DVD from amazon will come without its cardboard slip cover! This makes this DVD worth **a lot** less as far as a collector's standpoint. Did I miss something in the description? Why no slip cover.. shame on amazon. I thought they only sold complete retail DVDs.
1,Peter Pan - Platinum Edition,The disc would not play on our DVD player. It would partially play on our computer but still had issues about half way through. It had to be returned.
1,NOT WHAT IT SEEMS,"I gave this a one, if there was a zero I would have given it a zero because I ordered a two disc platinum edition I got one disc and it was bonus features. I tried contacting the seller and no one has gotten back to me. I feel ripped off."
1,Peter Pan(Fully Restored 45th Anniversary Limited Edition),"I was totally mislead on this purchase. I saw no where that it was a VHS. I was under the impression it was a DVD. Due to the fact I have no VHS anymore, it has never been used. Unfortunately, it was a gift and until it was opened, I did not know the problem. Quite embarrassing at the time. Also, I had thrown away the packaging papers and can not return it."
5,RED HAIR FOR ALL ?,"I love this film, always have, always will. HOWEVER the color restoration turned practically every characters' hair red. Wendy and John certainly never had red hair before. Although the original color is dated, it is much more beautiful."
5,Peter Pan best DVD yet,"Being a big Peter Pan fan (I saw it in the theater when it was first released back in 1952) and love this DVD. Great clean up and restoration of the film yet, plus lots of goodies. Great DVD and worth every penny for the Peter Pan Fan."
5,One Of My Favorite Disney Movies,"The day my dad bought me this tape back in april 1993, I instantly fell in-love with it. And while it was only the third addition to my Disney collection back then (following ""The Little Mermaid"" & ""Beauty and the Beast""), today, having over 20 Disney films in my library, it still remains one of my favorite Disney movies ever.I loved everything about this film, but mostly the glossy animation. It reminds me of that in ""Cinderella"". Very pristine, very detailed, amazing colors. Equally important, the characters are very appealing, especially Tinker-Bell and the evil-yet-hilarious Captain Hook. Wendy is also a great character, drawn very beautifully. The story of ""Peter Pan"" has always interested me, and therefore I had high expectations upon watching this movie for the first time. I remember watching it with my sisters; we were totally blown away by it. It's easily a classic in a league of its own."
1,Too Much Advertising!,"The Peter Pan cartoon is a classic, but the problem with this DVD is that Disney put about two hours of previews on this DVD set that you are forced to sit through before the actual movie comes on. You can try to forward through these previews, but it still takes quite awhile to click through them all. It's too bad that advertising is Disney's first priority."
2,Too many stereotypes and violence for a children's film,"I ordered both the Walt Disney Peter Pan video and the Mary Martin Peter Pan video for my son at the same time and the differences between the two are shocking. Walt Disney has exaggerated to the point of stereotyping many aspects of the story. For example, Tinkerbell, who represents a spirit in the story of Peter Pan, in the Walt Disney version is such a flirt and jealous, as well as overly concerned with how big her hips are that the whole meaning of her is lost. The indians in the Walt Disney version are stereotyped as well and I was shocked that as my son now says Indians don't have faces. The Walt Disney version contains much unnecessary violence. All and all the Mary MArtin Peter Pan is so much more heart-warming and magical and fun."
2,Peter Pan,This was a gift for my granddaughter. I saw part of the movie but was not impressed as I like more animation and less cartoons.
2,"Great story, except for the horrible racism","I love Disney movies and I remember loving this movie as a kid, but OMG the portrayal of Native Americans is so blatantly racist as to be simply stunning. There is NO way I'd let my kids watch this film. It is fine for adults I suppose who can approach the racism of this film with some sort of historical eye/filter.Don't think it's racist? Go onto a reservation tomorrow and yell ""redskins"" in a crowded room. Yeah, I didn't think so."
5,Kids love the movie,great movie one of the all time classics Peter Pan now my kids have it DVD blu ray and digital copy
4,Same great movie,I think my only problem with this was that on the DVD it did not have the special with Walt Disney that is on the VHS. It is on the Blu-ray but not the DVD.
3,Hmmmm,"well the product arrived on time and in good condition, however it was not quite what I remembered of Peter Pan. I do not remember Tinker Bell being such a brat. I guess I was a little naive. But I don't want my girls to start acting like that so we don't watch it."
5,awesome product,i was very satisfied with the quick delivery.i ordered it for my grandaughter.she has watched it over and over.thanks for the promptness in which you got it here.it made it here for her birthday .thanks again. joann threadgill
4,"You people haven't read the book, have you?","You people who complain about jealousy and malice! Most characters in the original novel -were- jealous and mean, but they had redeeming qualities. As a movie, this does disappoint me, but only the pictures. None of the characters looked as I imagined them except John and Michael. The costumes were off. Disney always does that. Pleaaase read the book, people! It's so wonderful. AND SEE THE LIVE REMAKE THAT JUST CAME OUT, IT'S AWESOME!"
5,Peter Pan DVD,"Item arrived timely and in perfect, new condition. No issues incurred when viewing the discs. My Granddaughter was ecstatic to have this video and I was excited to find it for her since it has been put back in the vault at Disney!"
5,Best Disney Movie EVER!!!,"Okay, so I'm a fifteen-year-old boy. This movie has always been my favorite of all the Disney movies. I would (and still do) watch it over and over when I was little, and it is keeps getting better and better. Disney had better get this one back on the shelves soon, because I missed it the last time it came out! When this movie comes out again (which I feel sure should happen in at least 10 years) you can bet I will be one of the first people in line! I don't care if I'm in college, I'll still get it. Maybe even watch it in my dorm with the door open! I don't care if people see me, Peter Pan is one of Disney's classics. Almost everyone loves the classics, instead of the crap they put out now. This is one movie that you must have, whether you want to have a Disney collection, or because you like the classics. Like I said, this is one of Disney's best and I won't miss out on the chance of getting it when it comes out. And you shouldn't either!!"
1,NOT NEW!!!!!,"We bought this video with a condition rating of NEW! The video is certainly not new, the case is dirty - the movie is all static, and it skips. My son (who is autistic) had an extreme melt down because he was supposed to be able to watch PETER PAN, and we couldn't get through the movie! I will be returning this and will not purchase from this seller again. Shame on the seller for the misleading condition!!!"
1,UGH!!! Never received DVD,My daughter has been waiting on this DVD for 3 weeks now.Never got the DVD we ordered. Contacted seller by e-mail twice and they never responded back at all!!! Very disappointing.Do NOT recommend this seller at all.
1,Wrong DVD in package,"The Peter Pan DVD was purchased from Emma Keychains as a Christmas gift early in November. The package was given but never opened until late January, only to discover that the wrong DVD had been in the box. I emailed the seller and got no response. I would never trust this seller again."
1,regret puchasing,The racism makes this movie inappropriate. I regret buying it for my three-year-old and will not be showing it a second time.
1,Peter Pan,"Peter Pan is an exciting movie of make believe, fun for children of all ages to watch. I am disappointed that I cannot show it to my children because of the disgusting depiction of Aboriginal people throughout it. In one spot it actually says ""The red man is cunning but not intelligent"". I hope Disney has realized its errors and I think an edited version should be released with an apology to Aboriginal people."
1,Outdated story,"This movie should be tossed out, just as ""Song of the South"" was. I wasn't sure what to say when my daughter asked why the Native American was calling himself the ""red man."" In addition, Tinkerbell is portrayed as a sexualized, vindictive, jealous female stereotype from another era. We may have to throw this one away."
5,Presnet of grandchildren,We played this item for our grandchilren while we in the car [on the back seat DVD player system of course] going to and from WDW.
5,Peter Pan,The CD arrived as scheduled in perfect condition. It was new and shrink wrapped as represented. We have played the CD for my granddaughter and it is wonderful. The product matched our expectations.Peter Pan (2-Disc Platinum Edition)
4,Not the full original version,"This has always been one of my favorite Disney animated films. Loved it in the theatre, on VHS and DVD. What I had been waiting and hoping for was that the BluRay edition would restore it to its original 3D format. Alas, that does not seem to be the case. Of all the 50's 3D films, this one was probably the best. The flying over London scene was greeted by spontaneous applause for its breathtaking depth. Indeed, even in 2D it looks wonderful on DVD, which is why I had hoped for the new issue to include the 3D version with the BluRay edition. That said, I will still order it, dim the lights in my home theatre and enjoy my trip back to Never, Never Land--the second star to the right and straight on 'til morning!"
4,A Family Favorite,Like many other thousands of people I am a huge fan of Disney animated classics so I am very happy that this edition of Peter Pan is available. I always had a very active imagination as a kid and it kind of dwindled away as the years rolled on by so it is always enjoyable to watch this movie and think of never growing up. The story is so fun and magical. Now a little down side to this movie is I don't want my kids to try to fly out a window!!! Do you think Michael Jackson is trying to have the face of Peter Pan it really does look like him with the large eyes and very small nose?
5,Peter Pan - Limited Issue DVD,"""Peter Pan"", the 2nd Disney Classic that I added to my DVD library is another keeper. Another favorite from my childhood, the film is still a great experience to watch. The animation is still classic, as is the story. Of course, the appeal of the film has changed for me, from what it was when I was a kid. It is now a classic animation film, rather then just a cartoon.I was suprised with Disney didn't announce that this film was going to be part of their ""Platinum Editions"", but this DVD (while no extras) is still worth the purchase for the film its self. The picture is adequete as is the Dolby Digital Mix (Adequete for an animated film that is).If you are a DVD Collector, you should strongly consider purchasing this DVD, and all of Disney's Classics."
5,Love Dsiney,We love Disney movies and have most of them on DVD. Some of them can be pricey. This was a good buy.
3,"Great movie, but wasn't great for my laptop","My kids love this movie and I highly recommend it. Where I find fault is with the DVD itself and the Disney Corporation.Twice now, when inserted into a computer it has completely screwed things up. First, on my laptop for which a system restore was able to fix and the cause was blamed on the anti-piracy software that automatically runs. The second time, when my daughter inserted the disk into my neighbors desktop computer and the Geek Squad after many hours ended up having to 'wipe the hard drive' and re-install everything. Again, the cause was blamed on 'anti-piracy protection'.So, the movie is great...just be cautious before you watch it on a computer."
4,"beautiful animation, wonderful story","A fresh, uplifting story from the day when disney's characters weren't santatized results of marketing surveys"
3,Am I Remembering this right?,"I watched this video with my children. It was the first time I've seen Peter Pan since my own childhood and it was every bit as captivating as I'd remembered - with one exception. I waited expectantly for the moment that Peter Pan asks the audience to help him save Tinkerbell. It seems that the scene was cut short. Without that critical footage, it just wasn't the same movie."
4,Peter Pan Problem,"Everyone knows how great this movie is and what a milestone it was for the Disney company, so I won't ramble on about it, but I think it is very important for everyone buying it for the documentary included on the tape to know that it isn't on there, so don't waste your time looking. I thought I had a bad tape, so I called Disney and they told me that somewhere in editing, they had made a mistake, and forgot to put the documentary on the tape. OOOPS! Avoid the mess and just get the DVD."
4,Enchanting,This is one of the best movies Disney has ever made. The reason I gave it four stars is because the women are made as the enemies in this film. But as a child that didn't matter. Your children will love dreaming that neverland really exsist. I highly reccommend buying this movie for your children.
5,Thanks for great customer service,I ordered a new copy of Peter Pan. It had parts that skipped and stuck. I contacted customer service and they responded immediately. The product must have been defective. They issued a full refund right away. Thanks for handling this so nicely and for a speedy refund. Highly recommend this seller.
5,Pan-tastic,"Looks great & the additional material was fun. I didn't know a lot of that stuff, so it was fun to see all of the creative genius behind Walt's work."
5,love this movie,This was one of my favorites when I was growing up. I;m excited that it's now out on DVD.
5,A Masterpiece,"Peter Pan is one of the greatest films Disney has ever made. Whenever the name ""Peter Pan"" is mentioned, virtually everybody thinks of Disney's version of Peter, Tinker Bell and Captian Hook. The story has never before been told so well. I loved this movie when I was in kindergarten and I love it even more now that I'm an adult. This movie gets an A+"
1,Not the version I remember....,"We bought it and watched it with our daughter last weekend and I found it to be AWFUL.... I grew up with the Mary Martin LP and was IN a performance of it when I was in about 3rd grade, so admittedly I know it better in the musical version and would not tolerate any deviation well, but YE gods. Cartoonish, offensive caricatures of Indians, pirates, busy dads, women and girls, a portrayal of Tinkerbell as homicidally jealous of Wendy, and not even the redeeming ""Clap if you believe in fairies"" line - that was completely left out. I do not remember this version from my childhood and ended up sorry that it was my daughter's introduction to the story."
2,disney racism at its worst,"I am sorry to say that the 'new' version of Peter Pan does not leave out the terribly racist scene depicting Indians as redmen unable to speak in complete sentences, willing to make anyone a member of their tribe and hand out eagle feathers to anyone who comes around. I am surprised this flies now a days, but apparently people aren't bothered by racism when those offended are fewer in numbers. It would be interesting to see what the backlash would be if this were another minority group.If you wish to raise tolerant children, pick another movie."
2,"Lousy Movie, but Great Symbolism!","I won't lie. It's been over six years since I have actually seen this movie. Back then I didn't like it. I still don't. But now, I have realized something: there is symbolism in this movie. You see, Peter Pan represents a certain someone. Who, you ask? Come closer. Now, we all know that the character Tinkerbell was modeled after, (or at least drawn to the likeness of), Marilyn Monroe. Coincidence? I don't think so. Can you guess who Pan is yet? Oh-kay, Peter Pan stands for John F. Kennedy- you know, irresponsible, young, womanizing, etc. Don't believe me? Look at Pan! He's dressed in green, the color of the Irish. He associates with not one, not two, but three women in this film. Sounds like JFK to me. Wendy stands as the voice of reason, Jackie. Captain Hook, of course, is Lee Harvey Oswald, and that alligator... or crocodile... thing, is Jack Ruby. Odd, isn't it?Well, I hope you've enjoyed this little essay... or review... or... ah, whatever."
4,"Correction, Please","Just a brief correction of the previous review. Your heart's in the right place, Charles (fellow Atlantan!) and you're absolutely correct to insist that PETER PAN isn't a widescreen film...but KING & I most definitely WAS NOT the first widescreen movie. That honor likely falls to Abel Gance's 1927 masterpiece NAPOLEON. Even in the modern era, Fox had had their Cinemascope process going strong for 3 years by the time KING & I appeared. The first Cinemascope film was THE ROBE, released on September 16, 1953, followed by BENEATH THE 12 MILE REEF the same year and then dozens of others. It IS true that the first widescreen cartoon feature did not appear until 1956: Disney's own LADY AND THE TRAMP, also in Cinemascope. At any rate, buyers can approach this disc with confidence; nothing at all is ""cut-off."""
5,USED TO BE HARD TO FIND,"Used to be that this cd was a hard to find classic. It was re-released a couple years ago with 2 extra songs, so it should be readily available in your local record store. I I found this cd years ago and scooped it up and was glad that I did. It is classic Armatrading. On this cd, she co-wrote the songs with a woman named Pam Nestor. Not sure why that partneship ended, because this is some of the most beautiful music I have heard. I love the opener, ""my Family"". It makes me think of how the 60's and early 70's must have been like, with the attitude that we are all brothers and sisters. I also like ""It Could Have Been Better"" and ""All the Kings Gardens"". Check this one out along with ""Back to the Night""."
4,Early Joan work essential listening,"'Whatever's For Us' was once a difficult album to find, and is probably why alot of people thought that her career began with 1976's self titled album.'Whatever's For Us' is simply a stunning album with some beautiful piano playing. Highlights include 'Alice' and 'It Could Have Been Better'. The opening track 'My Family' is the perfect choice, and as the inner sleeve notes suggest, very early Elton John sounding.The repackaged CD allows us all to truly appreciate the beginning of Joan Armatrading, who in my opinion is underrated in many countries. This CD also includes a bonus single which was also previously hard to find.If you buy this, then the album ""Joan Armatrading"", you will really appreciate this fine artist. Two listens of the song ""Love and Affection"" will cement your thoughts on how great she is."
5,Difficult book made easier!,"In parallel reading the book, saw the movie, but this classic novel is still difficult to completely understand - just like women! Anyway thes not were the best. THANKS!"
2,Third and Purgatory,"Ben Patrick Johnson is a voice over announcer for movies and television. He ought to keep those vocal chords bathed in warm salt water so he can hang on to his day job because I don't see much of a future as a novelist. This story is about four rather uninteresting characters and the losers they hook up with. It is slow and repetitious. It is also full of typos, spelling mistakes and grammatical errors. The lazy writing and sloppy editing are best exemplified by the Freddy and Justin characters who first meet on the Fourth of July then celebrate their ""two month anniversary"" on Thanksgiving! Huh? The ending is so sappy and unbelievable that it is a fairy tale. But, then, maybe that's where Johnson gets it right because this is, after all, a fairy tale."
1,Sex & the City for the gay men,"I have to agree with some of the other reviews here..this was by far the lamest book I have read in a long time. I am basically half way through the book and seriously considering dropping it. It is like a VERY BAD version of Sex & the City but only difference the characters are all gay and the lines not nearly as funny or intelligent. None of the characters, with maybe the exception of Claire have anything interesting or funny to say. Not to mention the countless typos and bad English used in sentences all over the book. For someone who obviously worships his own body, Ben spent way too much time writting about a greasy spoon breakfast place. I agree...Ben, stick to the weights and voice overs..leave the writting to people who can actually do it."
4,Great summer read,"This book is thoroughly fun and enjoyable. Johnson gets at some weighty stuff, but uses humor as the sugar that helps the medicine go down. I read it over the course of the weekend and was glad I did."
5,This book made me cry (laughing),"I live in L.A. and know firsthand how insane the entertainment business is. That Johnson captures some of its players with style and empathy -- and makes them funny in a kind, loving way -- says a lot for his writing ability. There are some haters out there who will slam Johnson because he does so many things so well. But I am here to say that writing is definitely a big strength of his. I do not know him personally but I will eagerly await his next novel. Especially enjoyed the section in Third and Heaven where Ritchie auditions for American Idol."
3,"wax sticks are half cylinders, not full cylinders, great product though","Pros: it's a good product, the wax works well and you can blend, I refinish vintage furniture so believe we without too many words, it's great for small nicks and chips in veneer.Cons: the photos make you believe that each stick of wax is a full cylinder, but they are all half cylinders sitting on a false bottom panel"
3,these are big fat crayons,"if you warm them up, these will do a mediocre job of filling a scratch. i used them for some scratches i have on my wood floors and i can definitely still see the scratches, although a little bit less than i could before. one good thing is that there are a ton of colours, so it's easy to match any surface. unfortunately, there are no miracles here but this set will make the scratches less offensive."
1,There is nothing soft or fast about Softwax from Fastcap!,"Unless I am missing something, and I don't that is possible as there are only 4 simple steps for application, I am completely dissatisfied with this product. First, it is not 'soft' wax, it is hard like a crayon. You rub it on like a crayon, but it is hard getting the wax to fill the nail hole and as you rub it on, it gets all over the wood - that is step one. The last three steps envolve removing the excess wax. Maybe if you only had one nail hole to fill you would be satified with Softwax, though I find that questionable. Unfortunately, our house is under construction and it would take forever to fill and clean the surface around every nail hole in all the trim work using this product. One star is one star too much for Softwax!"
5,Pleasing Variety of Songs,"I picked this one up from a ""bargin bin"" in some local store, taking a chance that if any of the songs sounded good then it was a nice investment. To my surprise, it is one of the best buys that I have made for awhile. The CD blasts off with the Byrd's ""So You Want to be a Rock & Roll Star"", reminding me of the style of the Beatles and the mania of the fans. Donovan's dreamy ""Sunsine Superman"" comes next followed by the horn and guitar fusion of ""Spinning Wheel"" by Blood, Sweat & Tears. The rest of the CD blows me away, every song on it is a classic and I must recomend this higly"
5,THIS CD IS THE S@#T! DONT THINK ABOUT STOPPIN NO LIMIT!,"This CD is Tight! Go out and buy it as soon as possible. Gambino Family is definetely Ghetto organized, by who? Master P, and the whole No Limit Family. Overall, Great CD go buy it. No Limit fans will LOVE this one!"
4,Nice album,"I was surprised by this album. There are several good songs on here with hard hitting beats. I was wondering whatever happened to the Gambino Family? Pheno left the group, and I heard they had changed their name to the Young Gunz, but I don't know if they have anymore material out."
2,"Thin Characters, Weird Values","Biggest criticism is thinness of characters. Perhaps if I had started this series at beginning, I would have cared more about them, but, as it was, none were that likeable, interesting, or believable. Most problems were related to character's values that make them do certain things. Emotions always seem like plot devices, not something real people would have, especially characters that are suppose to be empaths."
2,"Great toy, but easy to destroy","Our dogs love tennis balls, so loved the bone when we bought it. It gives to allow chewing on it and squeaks...but our lab/shepherd (who is an aggressive chewer) had the nub torn off within minutes....they still chew on it...but it is not a durable item for dogs who really chew. Better money spent on the tennis ball... Two stars for interest...but one or less for value in $ spent."
3,They need to improve the squeaker dog bone,"We have 3 air kong products and 2 are with the squeakers, both the bone and ring squeakers were punctured by our dog within the first day of playing. Wonderful product and our dogs love them, but the manufacturer needs to improve upon the squeaker to where it cannot be punctured or pushed into the toy. Even after the squeaker has quit working, our dogs still love to play with the toys. So it is worth the cost."
2,Poorly Made. Not Safe.,"We bought this toy for our 8 year old, 73 pound, Airedale Terrier and he immediately loved it! Sadly, we had to take it from him in less than an hour because he started to rip the yellow fuzz off and expose the squeaker. It's too bad, because he really took to this toy straight away. I know it's not a ""chew toy"" but expected for it to last longer than 50 minutes."
5,Great squeaker bone,We have a 75lb. puppy who is a heavy chewer. He's had this toy for a couple of weeks now and it has held up well. This bone is surprisingly heavy. He loves laying down with this bone as there are squeakers at both ends and in the middle which grabs and keeps his attention.
1,The shortest lasting toy ever for my 55 pound Golden Doodle,I really like the size and base construction. Problem is the tennis ball type material that covers the bone seems unnecessary and was compromized in 5 minutes of the dog playing with it. This was probably the shortest lived toy ever for this dog. He is a 55 pound Golden Doodle.
5,"oops, can't believe i ordered a small toy",I know Kong air dog toys to be great quality. I bought this because of how much my dog liked the air dog squeaker stick. Too bad I didn't realize it was a small bone I meant to order a medium or large.
4,Dog loves it,"I have a standard Dachshund mix, he loves this toy, we play fetch with it all the time, only problem is he likes to rip the tennis covering off."
2,Fun but fragile,"Our corgi loves this toy, but it did not last more than a couple of weeks. The cover seam parted after some play time and it did not take long for the entire cover to start coming off."
3,Kong Air Squeaker Bone,My boys carry it around and love to chew on it and they love it when squeaks . All though I should of gotten the med. one instead . I WISH THEY WOULD BRING BACK THE KONG SQUEAKY JACKS THAT WAS THERE MOST FAVORITE TOY !!!!!!!
2,Good concept but didn't work for my small puppy,"I think dog toy would have been better had it been made out of some kind of silicone outer layer, and not the fuzzy tennis ball it is. For little dogs with little teeth they tend to pull the fuzzy layer off and then you find it all over your house and some I'm sure got eaten by the puppy. I even found my older dog with some of it in her mouth so I know my puppy ate some of it."
4,Dogs love them!,"I have 2 dogs (Doberman/Lab mix and Border Collie mix) and both of them love the Kong squeaker toys. They have had several of the bone shaped ones. I don't mind that they strip the yellow fuzz off, because they still love to play with them regardless. The only complaint I have is that once they find the squeaker its not long before they can get it popped out. My dogs are heavy chewers and these seem to hold up for a long time before the inevitable total destruction occurs."
2,not all KONG are made equal...pass on this one.,"Our 7month old maltipoo loves to play with tennis balls and squeaky toys, so we thought this would be great. unfortunately, he tore off the covering on this toy in 5 minutes! don't bother with it."
1,Doggies ate in in 5 minutes,"Yep,Unlike the original KONG, these were goners. I was hoping they would last somewhat as long as the KONGS. They did not, won't buy anything other than the original!"
1,Not for aggresive chewers,I have a brutally aggressive chewer (35 pound springer spaniel mix). She uses her incisors to rip toys apart. She immediately ripped the fabric off the toy. The pieces of the bone were in the trash within five minutes.
1,Not well made,Dog ripped the felt off in less than a half hour. Expected a little better quality. Still squeaks after all the felt was removed.
3,A little too big...,I bought these for 2 Yellow Labs and thought that there that they would not be big enough. Sadly they are not the favored toy as they are a little too big even for my BIG labs!
2,Too small,"When they say small, they mean small. I love the Kong products for my 1 year old german shepherd that has chewed through every toy I have ever bought...Kong products usually last an extra day or two.... I couldn't even give him this one without fear of him swallowing it. I gave it to a friend with a small dog. Good but for small dogs only!"
2,Highly dangerous and easy to chew.,"I bought three of these Air Dog toys in different shapes and my small dachshund-chihuahua mix chewed them all up in less than two hours. I know it says in small print that they are made as ""toss"" toys, not for chewing, try telling that to your dog. The most dangerous thing of all is that the ""squeaker"" is held in place with a small white plastic screw that is the first thing to come out and can easily be swallowed by any dog. Luckily I found all three screws on the floor and not in his throat. I normally like Kong products, but definitely not these."
3,a lot better with age,"i remember getting this record when it came out and thinking it was pretty weak (i'm a huge ufo fan so mogg/way gets held to high standards)... but it's years later, and this record is like a discoverd little treasure now. really solid songs and better than ""chocolate box"" - great guitar playing and just another really good batch of tunes for all of you out there who are still looking for a ufo fix"
3,This is NOT a concert..it is a doc. with second hand views,"Rolling Thunder and The Gospel Years / Bob Dylan 1975-1981 / ""a totally unauthorized documentary"" / ""contains NO Bob Dylan songs"":This is about these specific years in Bob Dylan's musical and personal life. The opinions are those of the participants (not Bob's), and some of the opinions are clearly wrong. There is no Dylan music here (as it says in small print on the bottom of the front cover). The concluding opinions about Bob's `future ideals' are laughably stupid. However, this is still an interesting documentary. Just enough interesting stuff to give this Three Stars."
1,garbage,Worthless... No real Dylan music or footage. Just someone trying make money off Dylan's material. Definitely recommend NOT buying this.
1,lame video,This film is kind of embarrassing to watch.There is no Dylan music in the movie so the soundtrack is a never ending vamping rip off of the Desire album. The camera work and lighting is terrible and the interviews are punctuated by weird pop up art and poorly done computer graffics. Watch it if you want to see Rubin Carter sweat under severe lighting in the back room of some photography studio interspersed with cartoon images of boxing gloves and prison bars. Seriously.There are some redeeming moments in the interviews with Ramblin' Jack Elliott and Scarlett Rivera etc. but you really have to fastforward through so much hokum to get to them that it is hardly worth it.
2,Where's Bob?,"This is a retrospective of Dylan's Rolling Thunder Revue put together by people who Dylan knew. Too much about Hurricane Carter, and too many interviews about Bobbie,but NO DYLAN! I wanted to hear his misic at those concerts, not a bunch of lengthy interviews from people who really had little ot nothing to do with Dylan's performance in 1975-76.They intersperse a so called Dylan impersonator. It's ridiculous!If you're really looking for a good video about this troop of characters, and especially Dylan, get the 4 hrs of film taken of the concert. It's on DVD somewhere."
3,"When will they rerelease the film ""Renaldo and Clara""?","I haven't seen this video, but with all of the recent releases of old Dylan material, I'm hoping that and expanded version of ""Renaldo & Clara"" will be forthcoming. I never saw the original, but it was comprised of footage shot during the Rolling Thunder Tour. It seems a better way to go than this title."
3,"Great Technician , but this is a total Wank!","I think Ritchie is hip to the joke, but nobody else is laughing.His gonads must be so small from blowing his wad over every square inch of the recording studio.Too much wanking Ritchie boy, time to grow up."
3,almost perfect!,"This is a very good album I agree. But now, watch out for the new one CERTIFIED MIRACLE, released these days by the german lable Blue Buffalo Records. - Just wonderful... Thank you Duane."
3,Dexter + Hip-Hop,"When I first saw the commercial for this album on Cartoon Network, I knew I had to have it. I love Dexter's Lab, and I'm into Hip-Hop, what could be better?My feeling on the cd is mixed. Most of the tracks are good, but not all. The intro track is just the opening theme, which seems somewhat redundant. The Coolio track is pretty bad in my opinion, I think Coolio forgot how to rhyme at some point. Also De La Soul must not watch Dexter's Lab, since they think Dee-Dee is Dexter's little sister. However, the rest of the tracks are very well done, and overall the album is worth the price of admission. If you're a Dexter's Lab fan and you're into Hip-Hop, I'd say pick it up."
4,dexter's now rapping,this is more of a 3 1/2 stars honestly. it's cool but it's kinda weird to but i like it and if you like rap and dexter you like it too
1,what a drag,I bought this thinking it had the fun tunes from the TV show. If you don't like rap - don't get it. Very disappointed.
3,Could have done better...,"I listened to all the covers of ""Best Friend"". MXPX would have covered ""Best Friend"" better than Brandon Cruz could have, but perhaps Brandon and MXPX could get together to cover ""Best Friend"" just once. I would love to hear that!!"
4,THIS BOOK WILL KNOCK SOCKS OFF!!!!,I rate this book 4 stars. My favorit character is Willam. My favorit part in this book is when the witch turned everbody into birds. I recommed this book for the end at 3rd grade.
1,Horrible message and much too intense subject for kids,My son had to read this book for school and had I realized the content before we read it together I would not have let him read it. It is sickening and I am hoping to get it pulled out of my childs school. I have never hunted in my life nor do I intend to but this book was disturbing and much too deep of subject matter for my 6 year old son.
1,This is the worst R.D book I've ever read!,This book is badrEALLY SHORT AND BORINGoTHER R.D BOOKS ARE BETTER THATN THISi HATE THIS BOOK
3,The Magic Finger by Bon Qui Qui,"A young eight-year-old girl, the protagonist and narrator in The Magic Finger by Roald Dahl wants her friends Phillip and William Greg to stop hunting poor animals. She tries to stop them from hunting in the most polite manor, but they just snicker at her. She tries to avoid it, but one day the Gregs have gone too far. She uses the power of the ""magic finger"" on them, and something happens that she regrets. Will the Greg family be o.k.? Will they ever be normal again? I think this kids book could have used more challenging vocabulary, but sends a very important message. I would recommend this book for children ages 7-10."
3,Cute and Fun!,"This is the story of the Gregg's...mostly of the male Gregg's, the father, his son's and their love of hunting. When their unnamed 8 year old neighbor gets fed up with asking them nicely to stop killing birds and deer, she does the only thing she can...she uses the Magic Finger on them. We learn exactly what result befell the teacher how dared tell her what a stupid little girl she thought our nameless girl was in front of the whole class...and now it's the Gregg's turn to find out what it means to get the Magic Finger...I bet it's a lesson they won't soon forget! This is a fairly short book, slim on the characterization...but with loads of quirks and twists that make for a good fun read! Just the right length that we could all enjoy it and the Magic Finger would also make a fine read aloud book (for reading over a couple of nights). I give it a B+, great fun for young readers with just the right amount of hilarity to go with the lesson being taught here."
5,Y3 book review,"The magic finger is an amazing book written by Roald dahl.this book is about a girl who has some frends, but this girl had a magic finger !when the girl gets angry she zaps people and they turn into an animal.One morning her frends went intothe woods and came out with a dead deer the girl was so angry she zaped her frends!and suddenly they turnedinto birds so did there mum when she did not do anithing ,3 days later they had made a nest...I think the 1st part was the best beause Roald dahl put magic words into the book.I recommend this book to primary shcool children."
3,the magic finger,The girl in this book has a magic fingershe had it all her life. she uses it when she is angry to teach the people that she is angry at a lesson. If you want to find out what happens then you have to read this book.I liked this book because it teaches you to be kind to animals.I'd recommend this book to all that like magic.
4,The Magic Finger,"Have you ever imagined people turning into birds? If you would want to then ""Magic Finger"" is the book for you. In this book a little girl turns four people into birds to teach them a lesson. I liked this book because it had a good ending and big surprises. This book's pictures are unique because they weren't really detailed but you got the idea of what is going on in the book. I learned to hunt for a reason, (but I really do not want to hunt at all) Find out what happens when you hunt and a little girl with a magic finger finds you in this story, ""The Magic Finger!""By third grader,C.S. , Michigan"
3,Funny Book,This is a story about a girl with magic powers and a family that hunts. I liked the illustrations because they were funny. I would have given it five stars if it was longer.
4,The Magic Finger,The Magic FingerThe book is based on a magic finger this girl has. She has these neighbors. The girls neighbors like to hunt. One day they were hunting their dinner and the girl got very angery and stuck her magic finger at them and said you will be sorry. Sure enough the next day something happened to them all. Read this great book to find out what happens. This book was great and I recomend it to all of you.
4,Great book for young readers,"I read this book called The Magic Finger. It's a great book! It's about a little girl with a magic finger. Every time she sees red of gets really really mad at someone she points her magic finger at someone. She turns them into an animal. This little girl has no control of her magic finger. I would only read this book if you like fiction and magic. This book is by Roald Dahl. Read this book!Maya, age 8"
4,Suicidal Swede and Conniving Canadian,"An amateur female sleuth first-person-narrated cosy. This is the best of the series and I'd recommend starting with it if you're new to Kathleen Taylor. She fills in the back plot smoothly. I thought the earlier ones suffered from clunky dialog and implausible plots. Her detective, Tory Bauer is an overweight forty-something widowed waitress who has lived and worked all her life in a small town in north-east South Dakota. They go to Aberdeen or Sioux Falls for the excitement of big city lights. There are romantic comedy elements that may put you off if you're allergic to those ingredients. Chapters begin with ""dear reader"" type essays that invoke the great ones and ask what Kinsey Milhone or Miss Marples would have done. I thought it was an interesting gimmick myself. It's a few years since the last Tory Bauer book but Kathleen Taylor has a great WEB site still."
2,Contradictions are significant,"Normally I truly enjoy the Tory Bauer series, however this book was a disappointment. When the suicide note said the victim was ODing and on what, and the note was read by our protagonist and others, then the note turns up missing and the ambulance driver asks what they thought she'd taken and the author couldn't come up with a better cover than deniability (said info theoretically being able to save a life) this was inplausable. The series frequently harps on how terrible it is to die. This was the first major contradiction. The second deals with the same note and the fact that our protaganists had BROUGHT UP the subject with the chaperone, then when the chaperone ""found"" it, it was as if the subject had never come up. No wonder I was able to find the book used and cheaply. The rest of the books, while having their own contradictions, were not nearly so glaring and I could more easily suspend disbelief."
1,Don't believe the hype,"Isn't it interesting that rock 'n roll only seems to have validity to these scribes within certain contexts? Elvis, Chuck Berry, the Beatles, The Stones, The Velvets, Springsteen, Punk and (God help us) U2 all make the grade. As for anything else; You can have The Doors only with the caveat that they weren't really very good. Can't have Yes or Jethro Tull, they're too ""Pretentious."" And Black Sabbath? Steely Dan? Crosby, Stills and Nash? Hey, folks, whether you want to admit it or not, THEY and a ton of other ""musical pariahs"" were much more a part of rock n'roll's POPULAR history than any critic's darlings ever were and omitting them calls into question how ""sweeping"" a so-called social history of rock really could be. This book is another bloated text along ROLLING STONE's party lines. It tells you nothing that hasn't already been written, shown on VH-1 and MTV and embalmed in the Rock 'N Roll Hall Of Fame."
2,Rock died when Elvis did...I didn't know!,"This book begins with alternating chapters dealing with the creative and business side of Rock in alternating chapters. While interesting, this dry relating of information is preferable to the idea that very little music of note was created after the Sex Pistols, an idea that seems to grow as the book progresses. Elvis and The Beatles get their due but others whose impact was limited to style are favored over true originals. While Little Richard and Jim Morrisson definitely made an impact, were they true musical pioneers or was this a case of style over substance? The author is making a case for this concept and the idea of ""selling out"" is bandied about. Were classical composers selling out when they wrote for a fee or circumstance? I wasn't convinced."
3,All very interesting but not very rock and roll,"All very interesting -- a very interesting look at rock and roll as a musical genre co-opted by ""the industry"" and ultimately rendered soul-less. Can you really call Elvis, Dylan, the Stones and the Beatles or even the Sex Pistols revolutionary when they are being used to generate billions by the establishment against which they were supposedly rebelling?Not very rock and roll -- where the hell is Brian Wilson, arguably the greatest writer and producer of rock/pop music of his generation. Pets Sounds gets the one-off treatment in a list with Blonde on Blonde and the Byrds Fifth Dimension. Never mind that a 24 year old kid in California wrote, arranged, recorded and produced this MASTERPIECE by himself (instead of having the wiz, George Martin and his orchestra behind the works like another well known band)."
2,it's okay,"It doesn't really smell like anything, and the heat creates dampness on what ever you put it on. But it is a good size and shape."
1,smells bad!,"I bought two of these for my kids at christmas thinking they could put it in their beds to keep warm. The first one arrived with a hole in it and I've tried contacting them and have never received a response from them. Secondly, we put the other one in the microwave for the two minutes on ea. side and It smelled like it was burning. The first time I actually threw it outside because I thought it was going to catch on fire! It made our microwave smell like burnt popcorn and My kids hate the smell of it. This product stinks - LITERALLY!"
5,Ever wonder what life for a knight would be like?,I would strongly reccomend Knights for any kid or teen who would like to learn more about knights and the culture of the middle ages. The book contains colorful pictures and is very easy to read. It also contains interesting facts like: when knights were putting horse shoes on their horses for battle they would leave some of the nails sticking out of the hooves in order to injure enemies. Rachel Firth did an excellent job capturing knights and life in the middle ages and I would definatly give this bood two thumbs up!-Caitlin L.
1,DONT BUY,THIS RING IS VERY VERY MISLEADING. UNLESS YOU LIKE TRYING TO LOOK AT IT WITH A MAGNIFYING GLASS THEN THIS IS THE ONEFOR YOU. ID SAY IT'S PRETTY MUCH FALSE ADVERTISEMENT. THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU'D THINK IT IS. DONT GET IT..
1,What's up w/ the photo?,"This pic makes the ring look like it's a 2 carat diamond! 1/10 is super tiny, so this pic is very misleading. The diamond in the photo is very large when compared to the setting, yet 1/10 of a carat would be barely 2mm x 2mm! Not to mention the clarity is horrible and the color isn't much to brag about."
1,Low Quality,This item is so poorly made that by the time I received the item the corners looked as if the plastic chipped off of them. Almost as if it couldn't handle the slight banging received during shippement. And it couldn't have been the shipping that was horrible because the cardboard that the plastic covers weren't banged up... its like a mouse got hubgry took a few bits of the plastic and found something better to chew on once it got the plastic. I am returning them and doubt I'll ever even consider buying this brand again.I've seen cheaper for far better quality.
2,Not for the learned reader.,"I was recently assigned to read this book for an upper level english literature course at my university. This was a poor choice on the professor's part. Apparently it received all kinds of praise, as can be seen on the back cover, but I don't really understand why. I tossed this on the floor after reading the first five pages, and was unable to pick it up again until the day before we were to have the reading finished. It's like reading something that some high school girl wrote one day out of boredom. The characters are unbelievable, the main character in particular seeming to be a form of self-indulgence on the author's part. It is overly-idealistic and romantic, even for the period in which it was written. I certainly would not recommend this novel to anyone, young or old. It is pure rubbish."
5,A fascinating read,"This is a great book for anyone interested in western history. Mr. Bronson gives an eyewitness account of the last Sioux Sun Dance which by itself makes the book worth reading. His eyewitness account of Dull Knife's heroic fight to lead the Cheyenne 700 miles from their Oklahoma reservation, where they were starving, to the nortern plains where they were finally captured ranks as one of the greatest stories of courage ever told. This man was alive, and intelligent enough to write about a time in our history, when our country was changing. His writing records this time the way Charlie Russell did with paint and canvas."
5,I've loved this group for years,I saw them on a PBS show and tracked down this cd - in the 90's. I would so love another cd from then - but Plaid IS a helluva cd - so if that's it - I'm just glad I heard them and got this... be careful driving to it - you could get a ticket for speeding!!!
3,Seventies Thunder,"A weighty slab of 1970s style heavy metal, with thunderous sides provided by some of the decade's biggest names. The cuts by Blue Oyster Cult, Alice Cooper and Robin Trower aren't usually anthologized so those tunes make this CD more attractive. But when you get down to it, you can't go wrong with ""Highway Star"" from Deep Purple (another nice choice, rather than the overly familiar ""Smoke on the Water""), Humble Pie and Mountain. Toss in a little chunky pop, in the form of T. Rex and Rick Derringer and you've got yourself a nice little period piece. Just a few quibbles: Sweet? I dunno ... And where's KISS? This goes great with the soundtrack CD from the movie ""Dazed and Confused"" (which does have KISS)."
5,Extremely good overview,"Well, I still don't unserdtand all this crazy stuff but this book is an extremely good overview with lots of pictures. I am not Jewish but it looks like this book would be really good for Jewish people who want to understand how Kabbalah relates to their religous practices."
4,"Great read, but not a high quality printing","Love the story of a sheltered girl who learns to take care of herself when forced to move to a relative's farm. Five star story.Unfortunately the cover you see displayed here isn't the one you get from Amazon, and the book quality isn't high. Instead this is a cheapo digital publishing volume. Reading the book electronically would, IMO, be better than this.I will be looking for this as a used book, because the story is a winner."
5,great book,i am so impressed with this book. a lovely read. had me tearing up a few times. i would highly recommend it. i love Betsey.
5,One of the best!,"This is a great book! It's easy reading, and very enjoyable. I would recommend it to anyone!"
5,AWESOME!,"This book was a joy to read. My daughter read it to her 3 oldest daughter's, a chapter at a time. They could hardly wait for ""reading time"" and begged for more at the end of each chapter. The life lesson in this book is so valuable. I am pleased that I have my own personal copy."
5,A Wonderful Children's Book,"Understood Betsy"" was one of my favorite books from childhood and I was happy to see that it was available from Amazon. Even though it was first published in 1917, it is very contemporary in it's message about the importance of gaining self-esteem through accomplishment. In this day and age when parents tend to hover and worry over every small concern, this book show how Betsy, when sent to a farm to live, became a very confident and happy child due to the adults in her life who let her stretch her wings. Many of the ways in which these adults gave her a new life are very subtle but moving. Highly recommended for mid-elementary girls."
5,Fun childhood memory,"I ordered this for my iPod because I'd read it when I was a kid, and still remembered it. It's a sweet little story."
5,sweetly moving tale,This is a delightful story about a young girl overcoming her fears. She finds love and acceptance with her cousins.
4,You'll like this book!,"I think Understood Betsy is a book to stick with. It's hard to get into, but at the end it's great. It's about a girl that has to go somewhere that she does not want to go. She goes to school and finds a friend."
5,As close to Perfect as it Gets,"I have had the previous version of this watch for about 2 years. Although slightly heavy, it is the most perfect of the watches I have owned. It runs perfectly, it is absolutely beautiful, it sits on my wrist comfortably. The setting of the watch, the pullout of the stem(since it is only worn every so often, I always need to set it after it runs down) is flawless. No, I am not paid by TAG!"
1,talking? Who wants to talk?,"I'm a teenager who, by parental force, has read this book. Now, I must admit, some of the things are true... but... there are other books that I have read that sum it up much better. Frist of all, what adolescent wants to talk? I know that as soon as my mother or father says ""Why don't we sit down and talk for a while?"" I am instantaniousely up in my room with the music turned up. Don't talk to your teens unless you need to, they know how to get around it... trust me."
4,Becoming the Woman of His Dreams,This is a clearly written book with practical and Biblical suggestions on how to improve a marital relationship. The study guide in back is nice to have included.
2,Not Impressed,"I don't ever review things, but I was so dissappointed by this book I had to write about it. Don't waste your money. There is nothing to sink your teeth into in this book, I'm embarrassed to say I finished it even. The characters are boring and flat with no development and nothing concrete. The end felt like the authors just stopped writing because they got bored. The two authors are actresses and bartenders, so I don't know what I was expecting out of this. Sorry but it was a waste of my time to read."
4,Really enjoyed it!,"I found myself really caring about the main character Cassie. A lot of times chick lits can be very moany and very full of self pity so Cassie's pov was a breath of fresh air. This story isn't realistic at all (she misses out on a job at a bar, only to walk into the hottest club in the Hamptons and just happes to score a job there) but I didn't find that it took away from the book at all.The only thing that's stopping my from giving this book 5 stars is that I felt the ending wasn't well thought out and was very ""safe"". I won't spoil it, but I felt like not much effort was given to the ending. It felt kind of abrupt.Still though, I really enjoyed this book and would definitely recommend it!!"
5,A Perfect Read!,I adore this book...It captures the world of working in the service industry perfectly...This book is addicting..I absolutely could not put it down!
5,A lot of fun,"I found this book to be a really fun read. I've never been to the Hamptons, but after reading The Perfect Manhattan, I have a clear mental image of what it must be like. The novel provides a lot of insight into the life of a bartender and the class issues that exist in the Hamptons. It's funny and easy to get through. Highly reccomended!"
5,"smart, witty, and fun: a true page turner","The Perfect Manhattan is the perfect summer read! It blends romance, social commentary, comedy, and gossip within the lush backdrop of New York and the Hamptons. Cassie is a heroine everyone can relate too, and her trials, tribulations, loves, and laughs capture you right from the start.It was a true enjoyment reading this book and I recommend it to all looking for a fresh, fun, and flirty distraction."
4,Alarmingly Accurate,"Having worked behind the bar for five years, I'm always wary about picking up a book or watching a movie about bartenders. I found Coyote Ugly supemely insulting, etc... That being said, I was overall really impressed by The Perfect Manhattan. It paints a clear picture of what it's like to try to survive behind the bar of an insanely trendy club, all while putting up with a corrupt staff, slamming too many shots, and trying to make ends meet."
5,Perfect Reading Under The Bermudian Sun...,I started and finished this book while vacationing for a week in Bermuda and really enjoyed it!Actually talked to a number of bartenders about the book while there and got various unique and personal stories from those I shared it with. The book's not too far from the mark...A great ice-breaker to bring up to your favorite bartender(s)while on vacation and a great way to pass the day on a beautiful beach!
1,Lame,"I found this to be one of the most boring books I have ever read. It gave some great insight to what life is really like in the Hamptons, but beyond that, this book was boring. I found myself skimming pages instead of actually reading it, anxious to be finished. Nothing exciting happens. Lame story with no exciting climax. Cassie just goes to work everyday and learns more and more about bartending in the Hamptons. There is no solid ending either. I would not recommend."
2,Totally flat,"I'm a little surprised that this book has such a good average rating.The Perfect Manhattan is a very light read, but despite that, it's not fun or quick. It is rather repetitive and drags on far too long. Basically, the same few scenes repeat over and over to cover the whole summer, and then suddenly the main character wakes up from her ""love""-induced coma and gets smart about her boyfriend.The characters are flat. There is absolutely no development behind them, and the writing is really just not that good.I know this review is totally lazy, but just trust me, it's not that great a book. It's not unpleasant -- I finished it. But I kind of stuck with it just because I paid for it. The end was better than I thought it would be, which was a nice surprise."
5,"Fun, flirty read","From the first page of this book, I knew I would not be able to put it down. Cassie is a young college graduate with the world on a string, a yen for screenwriting-and a staggering pile of student loans weighing her down. In lieu of the lucrative snooze-fest of a reliable consulting job, she shocks everyone she knows by opting for a sexier, more flexible job: mixing drinks. When she accepts a summer gig bartending in the Hamptons, Cassie finds herself catapulted into a whirlwind of dazzling celebrity and over-the-top wealth unlike anything she's ever seen. Surrounded by playboys, moguls, spoiled kids, and Paris Hilton clones she soon wonders if it's more than she bargained for. It's a fun, weekend read that is very hard to put down."
3,"Great for the orchestra, but not the vocalist!","This edition of La Boheme is great. It is a full opera score. However, I would recommend this for someone playing in the orchestra pit rather than a vocalist because you have to really look hard to find your part and it shifts from page to page. Highlight your part everytime you see it, because it will shift on you from time to time!"
5,one of his best poetry books,"This is Buk at his peak, without any doubt this is his most coherent book and works even better than his poetry collection and shows Bukowski at the height of his poetic power. Highly recommended"
5,this man didn't hold much back.,"If you have not read bukowski you have not read the truth of perspective.Brace yourself, you will be in for one hell of a ride. I have never seen pain in such a beautiful, stark, and up-front manner as this man was able to communicate. it makes you want to bleed ink."
4,Good Prog From Down Under,"I have enjoyed Third Ending well enough to call it good Progressive Rock, but I cannot go so far as to call it great. All of the songs are well written and performed, but nothing, save maybe the first cut, stands out on its own as a really memorable song. Having said that, I must admit that I am glad to have the disc and do play it from time to time."
5,PROGRESSIVE,"EMOTIONAL DEBUT CD FROM THIS GREAT DOWN UNDER BAND . THEIR MUSIC IT'S A CROSS BETWEEN PORCUPINE TREE AND TILES . ONE OF THE BEST CD'S FROM 2007.ALL THE PACKAGE IS HERE : BEAUTIFUL CRAFTED COMPOSITIONS , OUTSTANDING ACOUSTIC PARTS AND A VERY GOOD PRODUCTION.WET DREAMS FOR PROG ROCK MANIACS!""CAN YOU HEAR ME"" IS ONE OF THE BEST SONGS EVER WRITTEN! YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME? TRY IT!"
2,TO TO MUCH PLAY IT SAFE NOT MY CUP OF CHA CHA !!!,"TO MUCH LIKE ALL THE OTHER STUFF ON THE RADIO WHICH IS OKAY IF YOUR INTO THOSE SORT OF GENRES OF MUSIC! BUT I'M A DIFFERENT ANIMAL I LIKE BANDS THAT GO OUT ON A LIMB SO TO SPEAK : PORCUPINE TREE , OPETH , ABIGAIL'S GHOST , RIVERSIDE , MINEMIC , ETC .THESE BANDS DON'T EXACTLY FIT INTO THE MAINSTREAM AND PREFER TO BE CREATIVE RATHER THAN JUST STAGNANT/MAINSTREAM AND NOT MORE OR LESS JUST PLAIN ORDINARY AND BORING WITH MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF INDIVIDUALITY.IT'S OKAY BUT NOT MUCH ELSE ! FOR EXAMPLE WHEN I PLAYED SELLING INSINCERITY ( ABIGAIL'S GHOST ) AT ABOUT 2AM I WAS I BIT TIRED BUT AS SOON AS I HEARD THEIR CD MY EARS PRICKED UP IMEDIATLEY AND I WAS WIDE AWAKE BUT NOT SO WITH THE THIRD ENDING SORRY BUT NOT MY CUP OF CHA CHA."" HINT HINT"" "" QUEENS OF THE STONE AGE / You Think I Ain't Worth A Dollar, But I Feel Like A Millionaire / CLONE RADIO !!! "" "" HINT HINT """
5,GREAT LOTION,"THIS ""LOTION"" IS NOT YOUR TYPICAL LOTION. IT IS MORE LIKE A MIST. BUT IT DEFINITELY WORKS LIKE A LOTION MINUS THE FEELING OF A HEAVY OR EVEN LIGHT LOTION. I USED TO USE A PRODUCT BY SOTHY'S FOR MY DAILY MOISTURIZER, BUT THIS HAS TAKEN ITS PLACE. YOU LIGHTLY ""MIST"" YOUR FACE AFTER CLEANSING AND GENTLY PAT INTO THE SKIN.THIS IS A MUST HAVE, NO MATTER IF YOU ARE OLD OR YOUNG (AND I'M YOUNG)."
5,Love it!,"Have used Yonka products for the past five years and absolutely love it. The Yonka lotion is a very mild astringent, but because it is alcohol free, it does not dry out your skin - feels awesomely refreshing."
2,Disappointed,"Product is good, however, it arrived leaking out of its container. I've rated it prior to this invitation and was told the vendor would send a replacement. It has never arrived"
1,"Very Bulky and very heavy, Completely off from the picture","I purchased the product for my wife and so disapointed with the product. The picture showed a nice watch that could fit into a small lady hand, instead the product is very bulky and very heavy."
3,ALLRIGHT,"The storyline, and the characters were good and so was the beginning but it did drag in places. The book would have been better if it wasn't so dragged out otherwise it would have been a decent book."
3,In the Fall,"I first read this book when i was about 16. I remember reading the back jacket and falling in love with it but i had to be secretive about it because kids my age didnt read stuff like this. Well as a 22 year old today, I found myself wanting a good read, and remembered this greatness that i thought the book to be. After re-reading this book with a slightly older set of eyes, I found myself not so in love with the story anymore. I mean for me the best part about this book is the first chapter. After that the story seems to go off onto other ventures. I think that if the author had just told just the story of the first two main characters in the first chapter, than the story really could have taken on a life of its own and kept the reader wanting more, but when it goes off to the story of the other males and their generations, i find that the story gets somewhat boring and doesnt hold my attention as good as the first chapter. But overall the book is ok and well worth a first read."
3,"skip, skip, skip","Such an intriguing plot! An interracial marriage and two generations that follow, looping back to find answers about the past. I wanted to read this book for such a long time, so when I finally got the book I dug right in. But, it was slow to get started and I found myself not caring if I read at night or didn't. When I did read, I'd skip words because it's too long in all the wrong places. For example, often there will be a fascinating dialogue and there you sit on the edge of your seat waiting to find out, ""what will he say????"" And right in the middle of the dialogue, Lent decides to tell you about the trees on the hillside and the sun going down and the cows and blah blah, I don't know because I skipped it hunting franticly for those quotation marks of the conversation which was just interrupted. It was tedious. And I wasn't 100% happy with the ending, because it felt untrue."
4,a little long at times,"I just finished reading In The Fall and am really glad I did. I found it difficult to get into at first and difficult to put down later. There were definately descriptive paragraphs that I skimmed. In my opionion there were times when those descriptions went long. That may just be my preference for reading about people though. I read many books about interracial families and biracial children and felt like this subject was handled well. It's a different time period than I'm used to. My only complaint was that the 2 sisters remained ""tragic mulattos"". Although they found a comfortable life for themselves they were unable to find love. That was way too cliche for the rest of the book. Definately worth reading."
3,Too Long...Should have been Three Books,The first part of the book was interesting and moved along. The second generation section came out of nowhere as far as the character Jaime was concerned. The leap of imagination to make his character believable was too great. The 3rd generation pulled the threads together but rambled along too long.Had hoped for an exploration of the black/white relationship in Vermont post Civil War. Our book group was unanimous in wondering where the editor was in the process.
1,So-o Disappointed!,Someone PLEASE tell me it's worth my time to continue reading this book. I've only read the first 50 pages and have little interest in continuing. I had great expectations after reading several reviews but cannot get into it at all. I think Mr. Lent's writing is beautiful but awkward and difficult to read. I really want to like it but it feels like a story whose characters and events I've read about quite frequently before. Say it ain't so someone...tell me it's worth finishing.
1,"I wanted to like this book,","maybe because it brought back fond memories of ""Cold Mountain"". But I found it flat,boring. I didn't even bother finishing it."
2,Could have gotten the story out in half the pages,"There were much to many useless paragraphs in the book to keep me interested. While the storyline was good, the story could have been told in half the pages in the book. I even gave it to a friend to read and she quit after 40 pages. Very disappointed!"
2,The Longest Read,"I found this book terribly tedious to read. Every action and statement of every character is dissected, discussed and analyzed ad nauseam. Sometimes a person wears a plaid shirt because it's the only clean one in the closet. I was looking forward to reading this book because the subject sounded fascinating, but I was very disappointed."
2,I wish I could love it,"This is the third big novel to adopt Cormac McCarthy's style. At times, ""In The Fall"" slips over into parody. I'm only about 100 pages into it, and at times the writing is so good it's almost painful. But now it's like a soap opera and I've lost my ability to care for the characters. It doesn't have the story structure of ""Cold Mountain,"" which alternated Ada trying to survive on the farm while Inman struggled to get back to her, both powerful narrative hooks. I haven't read ""Plainsong"" yet, but I hope it will be better. I doubt if any of them are as good as ""All the Pretty Horses"" or ""Blood Meridian,"" which is my favorite novel still."
1,The only book I've wanted to throw away,"It's not that the actual story is nonsense but they guy has included so much 'fluff' that you get board waiting on a paragraph with real content. This book was so frustrating, I really wish I had saved myself the bother of reading it."
2,I'm trying very hard........,"I'm trying very hard to like this book. Really, I am. I want to like Norman. Leah, and the children. I just don't. The only character I found that had some semblance of life was Marthe Ballou, and she's dead already. I'm only halfway through the book and I just want to throw it against the wall because I'm so disappointed. After reading all the glowing reviews, I decided to shell out the extra cash and buy the hardcover. I wish I hadn't. Lent wants to be a spectacular writer, and I suspect that he has it in him, but he's trying too hard. This book is in serious need of a good editor. Too much useless verbage and characters with no life. I'm going to plod my way to the end, though, and I hope that I'll change my mind by the last page."
1,Hmmmm,"I haven't finished the book, to be honest, and I feel that the author does have an interesting story. But, ahem... hey guys, have you analysed some of this guy's sentences? May I ask where the editors were on this one? Does this guy have delusions of Faulknerian granduer or what? I mean, if someone can straighten me out, ""I'm all ears,"" in the words of Ross Perot. Can someone explain what is meant by these ""run-on"" sentences? Or can anyone get published these days? Does that mean there might even be hope for me? There is one particular sentence that is 76 words long. And, I'm sure there are some that are even longer. Have we returned to the era of Dickens where we're paid by the word?"
2,derivative,"I found this book relentlessly echoing Faulkner's prose -- the broken sentences, omitted subjects, use of participles instead of active verbs -- but without Faulkner's love and deep knowledge of his characters. Also, is all that graphic sex and violence really necessary to the narrative?"
4,Compelling and thought-provoking,"This is a book with an interesting premise that makes us look beyond the narrow parameters of our own lives and contemplate the difficulties of a black woman living in a white world in Vermont in an inter-racial marriage. The very act of a former female slave walking from Virginia to Vermont following the Civil War with a Union soldier who would become her husband is the type of prose that makes this book so interesting. The characters are well-defined and the plot flows easily. This was a random selection by me at the library, and I am now a confirmed Lent fan."
4,Breathtaking,"The author truly keeps you turning the pages until the last wonderful chapter. The feelings he uncovers about race relations and family ties are so powerful.. then and now. Readers of ""Cold Mountain"" will love this one."
2,Language Tedious,"I love long, lanquid sentences, even indulgent ones if they describe a world or thoughts that are new to me. However, this is probably one of the most tedious books I have ever read, and I read fiction for a living. I picked up this book after reading interviews with several prominent (male) southern authors who said that Lent should be read by all. However, his prose is so affected that I wanted to scream. Please, God, find a subject and a verb now and again. The CONSTANT fragments ruined the rhythm of the writing and were so jarring that I almost became angrily frustrated as a reader. Lent is no Faulkner, and he would do good to find his own voice."
2,Overwritten good story,"One of the worst things one can say about a book is that ""It was too long."" This book could and should have been shorter and what should have been left out was obvious. The author interjects deep philosophocal soliloquies into the thoughts of a) uneducated Vermont farmer folk, b) freed slave woman, c) home school dropout bootlegger, etc. It is a shame the author went this route so often, for the story line and theme were excellent."
3,In the Fall,"This book is OK but too verbose, it was chosen by my book club members, it sounded interesting when we read the reviews, but it's too long, touches too many subjects with tremendous and unnecessary details."
5,"In the Fall, interracial marriage, civil war, prohibition","I am an avid reader and have read thousands of books in the past 60 years. I would rate this book as one of the ten best books I have ever read, including War and Peace and Quiet Flows the Don.In chapter two the first layer of the onion is revealed when a civil war soldier returns to New England with a brown wife from the south. The impact on his family and community is chronicled. Children are born. The second layer is revealed with a crushing impact on one's emotions.The next generation follows. It is as if it is a different book with a different locale and tales of prohibition. . Near the end, when the third generation returns to the farm, more truths are revealed.And finally, the third generation travels south to learn the truth about the former-slave, wife brought home by the soldier.Very well written book by a first-time author. I shall hold my breath waiting for the next work."
4,a book worth sticking with,"Yes, this is a book about slavery. But it is so much more. It is a book about the ""evil thread"" (I've returned the book to the library so I can't quote that passage) that weaves itself through the generations and grows larger in so doing. I especially relished the last third of the book in which Uncle Alex expounds on life -- things he has pondered for years, and things relevant to all of us. By the time I got to this part of the book, the structural elements that had slowed me down earlier vanished, and I was totally immersed. The end is powerful, not just a place to finish as have been so many of my recent reads."
2,Overwritten So Not Believable,"One of the worst things one can say about a book is: ""It was too long."" This book could and should have been shorter and what should have been left out was obvious. The author interjects deep philosophocal soliloquies into the thoughts of a) an uneducated Vermont farmer folk, b) a freed slave woman, c) a home school dropout bootlegger, etc. It is a shame the author went this route so often, for the story line and theme were excellent. The placement of these philosphical musings just did not fit."
2,Untimately Disappointing,"Though solid in concept and pretty in prose, this book could've used a better editor. Much too long and drawn out - I cannot image any reader failing to get impatient with it. 100 fewer pages would've done nicely."
5,blown away,"This simply put, is a great read.I usually don't go for sagas but this one I couldn't put down.I felt like I knew these people.Mr. Lent has hit one out of the park in his first at bat.Like Asher Brauner's 'Love songs of the tone deaf' this is an amazing display of literary talent for a first novel.Definitely read this book, you will abolutely love it"
4,Great in its own right,"I suppose the comparison with ""Cold Mountain"" is inevitable, given that book's critical and commercial success -- even Tony Earley made it in the New York Times' Book Review -- but it's also unfortunate. Both books start at the end of the Civil War, but that superficial connection really doesn't tell ""Cold Mountain"" lovers anything about ""In the Fall."" Lent's themes, beside encompassing many decades beyond Appomattox, are far darker and more profound and the writing is compellingly daring as Lent performs a prose high-wire act with his metaphors and narrative surprises. (Nor is he as obsessed with showing off his command of 19th century detail as Professor Frazier) Take ""In the Fall"" on its own terms and you will be dazzled and moved."
3,All but the middle!,"I agree in part with most of the other readers' reviews. To the reader from Baltimore, I hope you'll continue to read this one...because Foster's story is by far the most interesting and the best written portion of the book. I found Jamie's story tedious...and in need of more critical editing. Much of the dialoge between Jamie and Joey seemed contrived and not true to the time period. Lent does redeem himself with Foster's portion of the novel and his beautifully descriptive prose is made it difficult to put the book down."
4,Unhurried literature from a remarkable new author.,"Not unlike Cold Mountain (to which In The Fall has been loosely compared) this novel unfolds at an unhurried pace. Aside from that and the post Civil War setting, I fail to see any real similarities. In fact, I found the overall story of In The Fall to be more interesting in regard to varied characters, settings and actions. If I had to compare to any well known work I would pick Faulkner's Light In August. Those that appreciate literary fiction and aren't in a hurry to get through their ""to be read"" pile will probably enjoy this novel very much."
5,"Passion, Angst and Discovery","As a first-time novelist (""The Legacy"", Savage Press, 2000), I appreciate quality prose written by other first timers. Jeffrey Lent has hit the mark in this epic saga of Americana. Lent's charecters, his use of language and dialogue, all point towards a long and illustrious career as a fiction writer. Having just read ""Peace Like a River"", another much celebrated debut novel, I can honestly say that I liked ""In the Fall"" better. For readers who cherish history, this book seems to be a better fit. Both are expertly written and have memorable charecters but the overall historical context and Lent's positioning of race as a central theme, in a book set in lilly white New England, held my interest and compelled me to read when I wanted to sleep. Bravo!"
3,Touches on delicate subjects that should be discussed.,"Slavery, racism, sex, and how they all can effect not only those currently involved, but generations of people is what struck me most about this novel. As we think about our roots and think of where we came from, this book can add a different level of thinking.This book was well written, but seemed long winded in a couple of the areas and details. I didn't like the way the characters story would just stop and skip to the next generation. As others have said as well, I thought the ending was a let down.The thing I liked most about this novel was that it makes a person think about it when they are not reading it. It aslo makes a person think about their own lives and how certain things can pertain to it, such as how our actions today can effect others ofour posterity later on.If you are looking for some modern day literature that goes beyond the average story then this is the book for you."
2,THE WORST BOOK I EVER FINISHED,"I was lured by the great cover, & stellar reviews, but this book, as another reviewer said, is so derivative, not only of Faulkner but especially Cormac McCarthy. Anybody who's read McCarthy will, I expect, cringe at the repeated use of verbs like ""tamp"" & all the working-class language & taciturn (& shallow!) characters. The story's reasonably compelling, & I liked the middle section best, & yes there are some beautiful passages, but the prose is a cheap, clunky (intentionally clunky, it's still clunky--doesn't matter) imitation of true masters. You want a better imitation of Faulker & McCarthy, read Frazier's Cold Mountain. At least he has a grasp on sentence structure. And the ending's not even close to making it worthwhile. Please, literary hierarchy, don't send us any more cheap imitations like this one! Writers, strike out on your own!"
5,Silk Scarf,I love the colors in this scarf. It is well made and the pattern is nice. It was also a great price for a silk scarf.
2,80 love songs,well i order this cd but the cd i got in the mail wasnt this it was a love song cd but not this one. i knew all the songs on this one but the one that came maybe 2 wasnt happy but didnt have time to return it was for my wedding
5,good read,"This book covers the facts like no other history book does regarding this Spring Creek Raid. Since I live about8 miles from the area where the raid took place, John puts you right there. And the actions and reactions of thelocal folks really says a lot about attitudes at that time, especially between the cattlemen and sheepmen. Wonderful read."
3,Decent long edge.,"This is a decent straight edge for the price. It's not quality like a Starrett, but you won't cry when this one is dropped or worry about the edges. It is good enough for rough work, but don't expect much more."
2,hard to read,"Since this book was written in 1992 I believe we've discovered more about this drug than he addresses but it still was an interesting look into the lives of crack addicts living in N.Y.C. Honestly, being an X user myself it was quite hard to read this book, to read of the craving for this drug that I have actually experienced. Bad memories for me hence the low rating on the book."
5,good and solid,"This is one of their best. Eye to eye, and say goodbye are really good. For a fan, this one is a must"
3,A good release to start out with.,"This release would have to be Fates Warning's best release along with No Exit. This album is a nice connection of progression, melody, and power. It's a bit better than their previous album. The production is also very good and clear. I actually give this album 3.5 stars though, not three. There's no doubt that these guys are great musicians. I can also relate to some or most of the lyrics. ""Life in Still Water"" has a nice intro, especially the percussion part. If you're new to Fates Warning, this is a good album to start out with--so is No Exit."
3,"Honestly, I think it made my car worse!","1) I'm not sure if I installed in right-side up or upside down in the airbox. It seems to fit both ways, and I don't know if it matters.2) I forgot I installed it, and a few days later I noticed ""hey, my car seems to have less power"". Then I thought ""what have I done differently to my car?"", and I remembered I installed this air filter.Luckily, I saved the paper filter. I am going to put it back and see what happens. I'm also going to see if reversing the K&N; will matter.You may have a different experience, but this is what happened to me."
3,Herbal,Had no issues with this product trying to remember why I ordered it as I am yet to use it would purchase another product in the near future.
5,Worked for me!,"I started out with 3-4 a day and now that my milk production is up I try to have 2-3 a day and it seems to work for me. I don't know if I really need to still be drinking them, but I figure the the extra fluids can't hurt."
2,ehh---not amazing,"I'm a healthy 20 year old male with a good, working system. I've been trying to get this tea for months, so i finally broke down and just purchased it online because I read great things about it. honestly, its crap--pun intended. It's no different than any other tea, and any BM's that occur as the result of it are the same from drinking any other tea or coffee. I suppose the hot liquids do it partially for some people. its nothing great unfortunately. just tea."
1,Don't Buy Online!,"Just to let you all know, this product is readily available at GNC for $5.49, same amount of bags...Don't pay for it online, it will cost you too much! Especially if you are using it 3-5 times daily as the package says."
5,I don't like licorice but I LIKE THIS!!! Good for baby's tummy?,"Well, my milk production was/is fine... the reason I wanted to try this tea is because I was doing research on natural approaches to calming a baby's upset and gassy tummy, and this tea included almost all of the herbs recommended for the breastfeeding mom to induce.My big concern was that I wouldn't be able to tolerate the tea because I've tried licorice tea before and I absolutely couldn't STAND it!! But something about the blend of herbs they've used in this one makes it not only tolerable, but actually kind of yummy!It's pretty hard to tell what has helped the wee ones tummy, but good tea is good tea so I keep drinking it! And the case price is AWESOME!"
3,it did the job,this works! the taste isn't wonderful but the tea does what it is supposed to do. i used it for the master cleanse and it worked.
5,the best tea for milk,"I start drinking this tea two weeks after I started breastfeeding my baby. I didn't have enough milk, but after only few days drinking this tea I started pomping almost 6 oz from one breast. It's worth every dollar and it also taste delicious. Overall great product. I would recommend it to every mother who is breastfeeding."
1,WARNING FOR PREEMIE MOMS!!,"My son was born prematurely at 28 weeks. It was very difficult for me to maintain my milk flow with all the stress, and not being able to hold him, and going back to work with him still in the NICU... so I tried this tea. It definitely did result in producing more milk but within a week my son began bleeding out of his rectum. After a million tests, blood tranfusions, and total hysteria for days, we discovered that it was the tea. The main herbal ingredient is fennugreek, which acts like a natural anticoagulant. I may as well have been doping him up with massive doses of heparin. Luckily, we figured it out in time."
2,Didn't increase milk!!!!,I bought the 6 pack and followed the direction. The tea tastes great but it didn't increase my breast milk. I didn't have any luck with this product!
2,Nothing Special,"I used this product and did not have any bowel movement. I was using this in conjunction with ""The Master Cleanse"" diet and maybe the best option would have been to use an actual laxative but still....this product did nothing for me. Then again, all of our bodies are different and this may work better for you than it did for me."
1,Seems to be counterfeit,"I bought a 6 pack box since it looks exactly like the one my wife was buying at Whole Foods. but just slightly less expensive. Unfortunately it was the only similarity with the one from Whole Foods. It tastes differently and not as intensive, but the most important is that it doesnot help with the lactation, so after using one pack, we had to come back to Whole Foods and now trying to return remaining 5 packs."
2,Not working,I was so hopeful this would work after reading all the great reviews but Ive been using it at the highest suggested amount for a week and nada...
3,Wish i didn't buy so much,"This tea tastes good, does the job, but please don't let the bag sit in the water longer than what it says- it made my baby's belly ache bad :(I am going to try it again to see if it helps without it being so strong. I have so many boxes of this and recommend that you buy one box first to see if it helps you and does not make your baby sick."
4,So far so good,"I've been back at work now for almost 4 months and in the past couple of weeks I've noticed my production going way down. I used to get about 9-10 oz while at work but suddenly it dropped to 5-6 oz.I can't rate the effectiveness of this tea quite yet as I only started taking it and so far haven't had the recommended 2-3 cups per day. I've also started taking fenugreek capsules and trying to ramp up my pumping sessions. I have noticed a difference though and I am hoping to at least get back to my normal production if not increase it a bit as my 8 month old has been drinking more and more at daycare (now up to 15oz/day).I definitely think this tea can only be helping. Even if it is only a placebo effect anything that helps boost production is worth it. Also, I think it tastes great! Sort of a mild fennel/herbal taste. I usually make a cup, let it steep for at least 10 mins and then pour it over ice. It makes a great iced tea and I don't find it needs any sugar."
4,It's decent.,"I don't know if it was me drinking enough water or this Organic Mother's Milk tea, but it worked.I breastfed my daughter for six months, and I consumed two-three cups daily once or three times a week(it's recommended to drink three to five cups daily), and I had one box left, but if you're planning to breastfeed more than six months, 6 packs wouldn't be too much."
2,Great taste but no results.,"I really enjoyed this tea because of the taste, but I did not see the increase in milk supply as I had hoped. It may help along with pumping - but not by itself."
2,not for everyone,"I wish this had worked for me, unfortunately it caused my daughter to have lots of tummy trouble and gas"
2,Stuff tastes vile,"I don't know if it increased my milk supply because it was so disgusting that I could only stomach it a few times. I suppose if you are desperate, but I would go with the fenugreek and blessed thistle pills. You have to take a lot of the pills, like 9 per day but at least I could manage to take the pills. This stuff I had to force myself to drink, and it smells awful too."
2,Really increases supply but makes my baby cry,"When I returned to work my supply really went down. I was afraid I would not be able to continue breastfeeding. Just one cup of tea a day has increased my supply so much that I have to wear nursing pads again! However, my baby does not like this tea. Whenever I nurse her after drinking this tea she screams like she is in severe pain. I don't want her to hurt, so I have discontinued use of this tea."
1,horrible,This sucks. It didn't work at all. You're better off buying a chinese laxative tea from an international grocery store.
3,"Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't.","I think that the only reason why this works for some people is because they are adding more liquid to their diet when they add this tea. I was already a seriously lengthy water drinker and this made no difference to my milk production. I am convinced that my epidural screwed my chances of breastfeeding easily. I used pumps, which obviously work better than baby... but, even then my milk wasn't what it should have been. My mother, grandmother, and aunts were all pretty surprised at the lack of milk I was producing, considering my healthy organic lifestyle and my large water and liquid intake.Oh well. I tried this stuff for 3 months to no avail."
5,it really works!,"it really work! before i tried it i really didn't believe in it, but than a friend said, try it it worked for me. and i did, and it helps a lot."
4,prompt service,"product arrived promptly and exactly as described. Still unsure if Mother's Milk tea really helps with breastmilk production, but it's definitely worth a try"
3,"SO far, not working for me","Hey guys! So I finally tried this tea after reading these positive reviews, I was so excited and knew that finally something would work for me and my little one. My son has a milk protein allergy, so there is no decent formula out there that is safe for him and plus I wanted to nurse him, obvious reasons, breast milk is the best nutrition compared to any formulas out there. So, ever since I went back to work FULL time after 3 months off for maternity leave, my milk dropped significantly. It is sooooo frustrating. I finished all my frozen stash and it is the worst feeling ever. So then I started supplementing with some prescription Formula, which taste like crap. Anyhow, so finally I got this tea in mail, and it is day 3 already, made no difference to my milk production. I am so UNHAPPY! Seriously, Like how long do I have to wait for it to work, I am drinking 4-5 tea cups a day. Are there any other alternatives ladies?"
2,It doesn't work as it supposed.,"We bought 6 boxes. and drink the tea every day, did see any improvement unfortunatedly."
3,"It's Ok... Not for ""nosey"" people :)","I understand that the product does not guarantee increase in milk production, that is why I can't complain that it did not or helped in any way. It has a very strong herbal fragrance, which my coworkers weren't crazy about. So, if you have a sensitive nose, you will probably have a hard time consuming it."
1,Rip off,"A caveat to this review is that the tea is wonderful and really does help. But I digress...I purchased this same product for roughly $6. When I saw ""pack of 6"" in the product description, I thought $20 was a great price and purchased immediately. When the product arrived, there was only one box of tea, identitcal to what I normally spend $6 on! Waste of money for the SAME PRODUCT!"
5,this tea is a lifesaver,"I have been drinking this tea since the first week that my daughter was born. She is now 8 month sold, and I still rely on it. I have enormous mugs (~3 cups each) and I drink about 5 of those very day. I can not completely vouch for the power of the tea, but it does taste great and reminds me to drink my water throughout the day. I can't imagine drinking as much water as I do of this tea. I do notice a drop in milk supply when I am away from home and forget to make myself a cup or two throughout the day. I order a 6-pack every months and almost always run low by the time the next one arrives. I highly recommend this tea to any breastfeeding mother who wants to nurse for as long as possible. (sigh up for the monthly delivery and save lots of money.) Nothing beat the benefits of breastfeeding. If you think the tea is pricey - try purchasing formula! :)"
3,"""loves to read""","Not as good as I had hoped. First time I use the tea, it worked. Times after, not so much."
1,Side effect!,"Mother's milk tastes not bad. I am not sure whether it increased my milk since my production did not reduce after I stopped using it. However, be careful of the side effects! My baby showed diarrea, colic sympton, and stomach upset during my use of herb. All symptons went away after I got rid of Mother's milk. If you read PARENTING magazine of October 2011 issue(page 32), you'll know that ANISE, which is one of the main indegrients of Mother's Milk, might cause dangerous neurological problems of children. So, again, be careful of the side effects!"
3,it worked,"The tea came in the mail sooner the expected but it was a little beat up, but that may have happened while being shipped. I ordered the tea bcuz I didnt breastfeed my baby for a day due to a busy day and the next day it was like my milk was gone, I drank 4 glasses of the tea one day and fed my son like every 1-2 hrs and I think w/ the help tea I was back to normal. I drink the tea everyonce in a while now and I feel that it does help. It does have sort of a weird taste though. So all in all it was worth it."
3,"Tasted good, but didn't seem to work for me",This product didn't seem to do anything for me. Good ol' fashioned demand does the trick when my supply seems to be decreasing.
5,Does what it's supposed to,"I am giving this product five stars because it does what it's supposed to do. I used it during the Master Cleanse (let it steep for 15 minutes) and I had movements the next morning. It didn't keep me up at night or give me cramps.The taste, however, is awful. Another reviewer mentioned that it's too sweet... not even close. To me it tastes like bitter cloves. Next time I will try the peppermint flavor."
5,Great product!!!,"I was told by a friend to try this tea since I was going to be having twins. It has definitely been working for me. The taste isn't too bad, and it doesn't upset my stomach. The tea has even been recommended by nurses to women who are having problems with milk production. I definitely recommend it!!!"
3,Bummed,"I ordered this tea because I wanted to produce more milk so I could pump and bottle feed my daughter because I didn't want her getting used to the breast 100%. Unfortunately, it didn't work out for me. I only gave it 3 stars because at around the 2nd or 3rd day, I noticed that I was breaking out in different areas of my body and it was very itchy. I know it was the tea that caused the reaction because it was the only new thing I had started to take in and as soon as I stopped drinking it, the rash went away. So I can't really rate its efectiveness because I didn't drink it long enough. I'm not a big fan of tea, so I didn't care for the taste too much, but a little bit of sugar helped."
2,it works but....,"Guys ... i bought this tea 2 weeks ago .. and it works a little But it made my baby diarhea, gassy , spit up , and stomach upset and It made my bleeding worse so i stop drinking this tea . I only drink this for 3 days then i decided to stop . The taste is so nasty . I bought the value pack of this so yeah ive waisted my money ! So my NP recommend the Fenugreek and my milk starts to increase but not right away it takes me 1 week . Even Thoug i stop taking this fenugreek my milk still increase. ! So it realy works ... cause there is no side effects To my baby and we are both happy !"
1,doesnt do anything that a cup of water would,If I force myself to have couple cups of this as directed the milk supply goes up and if I don't it does not... so I tried the same idea with regular tea and then with the same amount of water..comes out the most important ingredients in the mothers milk tea is the water that you have at home for free.If you need the motivation of mothers milk tea to drink that much water and it works for you stick with it.. otherwise there is no reason to pay for a bad tasting tea.--------------------If you find my reviews helpful please mark it as so.. Thank you.
3,Can't say for sure if it really increases milk production,"I bought this product not because I had a supply issue but becuase I needed to increase my milk production in order to store some milk for future use. I don't think the tea tasted bad, it tastes like tea. Additionally to the tea I started having oatmeal once or twice a day. Before tea or oatmeal I could pump 2 extra ounces a day, after, I can pump 4 maybe 5 extra ounces a day. I think this probably works but not sure....."
2,No change,"If you follow package directions of 3-5 servings a day this box will only last you 3-5 days, that's a pretty significant cost. Also, it didn't work for me. I'm categorizing this one under ""magical remedies that don't work"""
1,doesnt work for me,"i bought about 4 boxes of these and they didnt really work. i didnt mind the taste, so i guess i will have tea to drink later. it might work for other people."
1,Did not work for me,"Too bad, they didn't work for me; I used them 3 to 4 times/day for about 2 weeks with no results. In fact, they seemed to dry me up more. So I stopped using them and I gave them away. I tried drinking more water and nursing more, that seemed to help better. The taste is not bad. Reminds me of chamomile."
5,works amazing!,"I ordered this tea for me and a friend, which we are both breastfeeding only.... after a few days of drinking the tea our supply def had a increase. I was pumping after returning to work, and was worried about not being able to pump enough for my daughter.. This def gave me the extra supply I needed.. and with honey the tea actually tastes really g ood, (="
5,Works well,"It most definitely does the intended job, however, i'm not a fan of the taste (licorice)........i wish it could be made a little fruity for people like me......ugh......but it does work and i continue to use it.........."
3,Didn't change my supply,I heard amazing things about this tea so I tie it and drank many cups a day. The taste wasn't bad so I didn't mind but I didn't notice any difference in my milk supply. :(
4,Great tea,"Bought for our daughter who just gave birth.This tea is suppose to increase mothers milk for breast feeding.Our daughter really didn't have any issues producing milk,we thought it could not hurt.Well she loves the taste of the tea and if produces more milk,then she have no problem going back to work filling those containers for our grandson"
1,disgusting!,"I have no doubt that this tea works, but I could just not handle the taste. I am used to having traditional tea with milk and sugar. This had a very strong taste and smell and actually made me gag while I drank it. I even added milk and sugar, but just couldn't make myself swallow the drink. I gave up after 3 cups. I love my son, but just couldn't get this stuff down:("
2,baby fussy,"i drank this tea for 4 days, only did 2 cups a day. the four days that i was drinking it, my baby was fussy and kept pulling away from the breast. he stared waking up in the middle of the night after 3 hours when he had been sleeping 7 hours. i stopped drinking it and he went back to normal sleep and eating patterns. the taste was okay. i started taking Nursing Blend Supplemnet and baby likes it. it is basically the same ingredients but with added daily vitamin. maybe it was the method of delivery, pill vs tea, that my body does better with the pill."
2,It did not work me and my baby!,"The price was good and I had hoped it will work for me. I followed the instruction strictly and had taken it 2-3 cups per day. It did not do anything for me at the first day, but I kept at it and hoped it would start working soon. To my surprise, my usually perfect normal and healthy baby started to soil her diaper constantly, and its color is real green. Usually, she is quite regular and only goes once or twice the most. But suddenly, her diaper was dirty every single time we changed her and the color was very green. Despite of that, I kept drinking the tea for at least two more days because I thought it would just go away and I really need it to be working as I was returning to work.However, I finally had to stop it as it did not nothing to boost my milk supply, and baby's stool stays green. On the side note, the taste of tea is not too good either."
2,"Didn't notice much of a difference, wasn't worth the effort","I only noticed a slight increase in milk production with this tea, wasn't worth the effort. Found success only by getting a prescription for domperidome."
2,Yuck!,"Unfortunately, this tea tasted so bad that it made me nauseous and I was unable to drink enough of it to see if it had any effect on production."
1,Would not buy again,I did not like the taste of this tea and it did nothing to increase my milk supply. So for me it was a waste of money.
5,"This taste pretty good, go figure!","Used this with my Master Cleanse, I totally did not mind using this at all. Will look forward to buying this again."
3,Great value but haven't seen an improvement,"I love how cheap this value pack is! Even though this tea doesn't seem to help to increase my milk supply, I still like drinking it. And since I go through a bunch of it, I hated to have to make a trip to the specialty store every week. With this large shipment amount and low price, I'm very happy!"
5,Great Product at a Great Price!!!,This is the only product I've used that has really helped! I work full time and it is much easier to pump when I drink it in the morning.
4,tasty,This tea tastes delicious & fresh. I think it helps maintain the milk production that you are already producing.
3,It didn't work on me,Well...many ppl and my friends recommended me this product for nursing. So I purchased and drank about 3~4 cups a day for three weeks. However it didn't work on me. I don't know if it is just me or the product.
1,Didn't work for me,"I ordered this item in hopes that it would help me with my milk output. Right now I am barely keeping up with as much as my 4 month old will eat. However, after using 5 out of the 6 boxes in my initial order, I saw absolutely no increase in my output. I was really disappointed as there are so many awesome reviews. Good luck if you intend to try it. Just didn't work for me."
5,it works,"it worked for me. the flavor is just so so not bad. i used it when ever it seemed like i had less then she wanted, because of growing and on days that i was not working. spent about five days a way from baby(i pumped) but the amount deminished day by day. i drank this for a while after i came back. seems like it is delayed a little over 24 hour you get more milk on wensday after drinking on monday afternoon."
4,A fun way to learn about World War I,"At first, I thought this book was another general survey of World War I. While reading the prose, I felt as if I actually experienced the war. The pictures greatly added to the realistic presentation and my reading enjoyment."
4,Tribal Fusion Grooves from the Parallax Universe,"Greg Howe on his ""Parallax"" CD took the words fusion, rock, shred, and melody and made them into one word, ""Greg Howe"". This Cd features Greg ripping and singing his heart and soul through the very music that has kept his fans coming back for more. Having the punch of ""Tribal Tech"" and the softness of Adrian Legg. ""Parallax"" takes his creative visions to the next level of great guitar playing and expressiveness."
3,Howe does it,"3 1/2Howe is an always engaging enough electric soloist, regardless if his early 90's output has too much of a generic rock-funk backbone, to keep things stimulating enough for the virtuoso enthusiast to enjoy, as well as the casual rocker."
3,Wonderful and highly evocative,"It took me a long time to understand the significance of the animals, but once I did the book really made a lot of sense. Not since Orwell have pigs and elephants been so beautifully--and sensuously--re-appropriated to the world of allegory. This book is a cunning, linguistic achievement."
2,I had mixed feelings about the book.,"I had mixed feelings about the book in question. I am a Native American from the South Western part of this country. While I was glad that an ""anglo"" such as Austin had the cultural awareness, sensitivity and diverstity to take an active interest in Native American issues I was also insulted by it. I felt that his portrayal of Native American's was as stereotypical and two dimensional as in a John Wayne movie. I drew a small measure of comfort from the fact that no matter how he portrayed my people it was less cliched than his portryal of the Russians in his masterwork. I also couldn't escape the feeling that this author was just another Anglo from the Suburbs who chose us poor ""Indians"" as his cause of the moment. I hope I am wrong about that because it would be nice to see more Anglos taking in interest in Native American issues but could we find one who did without portraying us in generalizations, two dimensions?"
1,Completley fake No buy No buy!,"There is no way anyone should buy this video. If there was the 0-stars-drop-kick-this-video I'd pick it. All scenes are professionally done...when I mean professional I am not hinting at any form of talent whatsoever..I mean not real amatuer like the box promises. Pathetic plots, effects, and length make this the most pathetic shockumentary of all time. the end."
5,genealogy,"This is the book for those of you exploring your roots, you may be an off branch of the Hayes Family and if so you will find this book helpful"
4,"Good workout, but...","I have many of Gilad's workouts, and I find that they are the ones I go to the most when I want to hit all areas + get a good aerobic workout. This one is no exception and I'm glad to have a more recent version but it is basically 2 of the new TV shows - no problem with that except that the ""commercial breaks"" are still there. There isn't an actual break of course but he leaves you with orders to do more reps during the break so you shortchange yourself as the video keeps going. You either have to pause it to get all of your reps in, or you miss out on completing all of the exercises."
3,Jassta,The plotlines seem to be getting ever more implausible although I guess that is par for the course for a show in its sixth season. The show itself remains one of my favorites and would rate 4-5 stars. The reason for the low rating is the lack of any subtitles on the boxset and Amazon's failure to make this clear from the product description. I would have expected that English for the hard of hearing would be a given and would certainly have enhanced not just my wife's enjoyment of the series as a non-native English speaker but also my own.
